PHILADELPIIIA:
PUBLISHED BY URIAH HUNT.1 8e3 3514. At sunrise, Columbus, in a rich and splendid dress,
Ianded, and, with a drawn sword in his hand, and displaying the royal standard, took possession of the island for the
crown of Spain, all his followers kneeling on the shiore
and kissinig the ground with tears of joy. The natives,
who had assembled in great numbers on the first appearance of the ships, stood around thle Spaniards, gazing in
speechless astonishment.
15. "The Europeans were hardly less amazed at the
scene before them. Every herb, and shrub, and tree was
different from those which flourished in Europe. The inhabitants appeared in the simple innocence of nature, entirely naked. Their black hair, long and uncurled, floated
upon their shoulders or was bound in tresses around their
heads. Though not tall, they were well shaped and active.
They were shy at first, through fear, but soon became familiar with the Spaniards; from-whom, with transports of
joy, they received various trinkets, for which in return
they gave such provisions as they had, and some cotton
yarn, the only commodity of value they could produce."
16. To-this island Colutmbus gave the name of San Salvador. The natives called it Guanahani, and by that
name it is now known. It is one of the Bahama isles, 4nl
is above three thousand miles from Gomera, the mnost
western of the Canaries. From the poverty and ignorance
of the ipIhabitants, Columbus was convinced that he had
not yet arrived at the rich country which was the object
of his search. Leaving Guanahani, he discovered and
visited several other islands, and at length arrived at one
called Havti, and by him Hispaniola. Here he remained
a few weeks, and then returned to Spain.
17. The news of his wonderful discovery filled the kingdom with astonishment and joy. His reception at court
was accompanied by flattering and splendid ceremonies
ordained for the occasion; and he was honored by many
proofs of royal favor. He made three subsequent voyages,
and, in 1498, discovered the continent of America, at the
mouth of the Oronoco, a river of the third or fourth magnitude in the New World, but far surpassing the largest
in the Old.
18. The honor, however of first discovering the continent, must, without diminishing the merit of Columnbus,
be given to John Cabot and his son Sebastian. They were
Venetians by birth, but, soon after the result of the first
voyage of Columbus was known, were sent, by the king
to
IXTR'ODUCTION.CHAPTER XII.
SOUTH-CAROLINA.
THIS colony, and that of North-Carolina, were, as has al
ready been stated, included in the same charter. In 1670,
governor Sayle made, at Port Royal, the first permanent
settlement wvithin its limits. The next year, he founded
Old Charleston, on the banks of the river Ashley. In
1684, all the freemen, meeting at this place, elected representatives to sit in the colonial parliament, according to
the provisions of the constitution prepared by Mr.Locke.
2. Several circumstances contributed to promote the
settlement of this colony. The conquest of New-York
induced many of the Dutch to resort to it. From England, puritans came to avoid the profanity and( licentious-.ness which disgraced the court of Charles II; and cavaliers, to retrieve their fortunes, exhausted by the civil
wars. The arbitrary measures of Louis XIV, drove maiiny
French protestants'into exile, some of whom crossed tihe
Atlantic and settled in Carolina. Many of these exiles
were rich; all were indulstrious, and by their exemplary
demeanor gained the g(ood will of the proprietors.
3. The situation of Charleston being found inconve.
nient, the inhabitants, in 1680, removed to Oyster Poi3(,
where a new city was laid out, to which the name of th.
other was given. In the same year, cominenced a war with
the Westoes, a powerful tribe of Indians, which threatened great injury to the colony. Peace, however, was soon
restored. In 1690, Seth Sothel, one of the proprietors,
having, for corrutpt conduct, been driven from North-Carolina, appeared suddenly at Charleston, and, aided by a
powerful faction, assumed the reins of government. Two
years afterwards he was removed from office.
4. The proprietors, having observed the good conduct
of the French protestanits, directed the governor to permit
them to elect representatives, a privilege which they had
never-yet exercised.  The English Episcopalians, unwilring that any of their heriditary enemies, who did not belong to their church, should be associated with themselves
in the enjoyment of the rights of freemen, were exasperated, and opposed the concession with great clamour and
zeal. They even went farther. Warmed by opposition0
they proposed to enforce, with respect to them, the law-sSOUTH-CAROLINA.
of England against foreigners, insisting that they could
not legally possess real estate in the colony. They also
declared that their marriages, being solemnized by French
ministers, were void, and that the children could not inlierit the property of their fathers. By the display of a
spirit so illiberal and unchristian, these strangers were
alarmed and discouraged. They knew not for whom they
labored. But, countenanced by the governor, they remained in the colony, and, for the present, withdrew their
claim to the right of suffrage.
5. Yet the ferment did not subside on the removal of
the cause which produced it. Such was the general
turbulence and disorder, the people complaining of their
rulers and quarrelling among themselves, that, in 1695,
John Archdale was sent over, as governor of both Carolims, and invested with full power to redress all grievances. He succeeded in restoring order, but found the
antipathy against the unfortunate exiles too great to be
encountered, with any hope of success, until softened by
time and their amiable deportment. These produced the
effects which he anticipated. In a few years, the French
protestants were admitted, by the general assembly, to all
the rights of citizens and freemen.
6. Although the proprietors, by the regulations which
were in force before the constitution of Locke was adopted,
and which were restored upon its abrogation, had stipulated, that liberty of conscience should be universally
enjoyed; yet one of them, Lord Granville, a bigoted
churchman, and James Moore, the governor, resolved to
effect, if possible, the establishment, in the colony, of
the Episcopal religion. They knew that a majority of
the people were dissenters, and that by art and intrigue
only, could their design be sacomplished. The governor,
who was avaricious and venal, became the tool of Gran
ville. He interfered in the elections, and, by bribing the
voters, succeeded in procuring a majority in the assembly
who would be subservient to his wishes.
7. A law was passed, establishing the episcopal religion,
and excluding dissenters from a seat in the assembly. It
was'iid before the proprietors, without whose sanction it
could not possess permanent validity. Archdale, who had
returned to England. opposed it with ability and spirit.
He insisted that good faith, policy, interest, even piety,
concurred to dictate its rejection. But lord Granville de.
lareod himself in'favor of it, and it received confirmatioi

1010SOITH-CAROLINA.
8. The dissenters saw themselves at once deprived of
those privileges for which they had abandonred their native
country, and encountered the dangers and hardships of
thle oceant and a wilderness.  Some prepared to leave the
colony and settle in Pennsylvania. Others l)roposed that
a remnonstrance against the law should first be presented
to the house of lords, and thiis rnmeasure was adopted. The
lords expressed, by a vote, their disapprobation of the law,
and upon tiheir solicitation, queen Anne declared it void.
Soon after, lord Granville died, and the colony, controlled
by more liberal councils, again enjoyed the blessings of
domestic quiet.
9. In 1702, war then existing between England and
Spain, governor Moore, thirsting for Spanish plunder, led
an expedition against St. Augustine. It was bad(ly planned,
worse executeT, and failed. Returning from defeat-abroa(1
he met, at homrie, the reproaches of his people. To silence
these, lie mnarched, at the head of a body of troops, against
the Apalachian Inidians, who had become insolent and
hostile. In4his expedition he was successfid, taking many
prisoners, and laying their towns inr ashes. By his victorics
over the savages, he retrieved his character; and, by
selling the prisoners as slaves, obtained, what he most
coveted, considerable personal -molument.
10. In 1706;, the Spaniards, fromn Florida, invaded
Carolina. The governor, Nathaniel Johlnson, having received intimation of their approach, erected fortifications
and made arrangements to obtain, on short warning, the
assistance of the militia. When the enenty's fleet appieared before Charleston, the whole strength of the colorny
was summoned to defend it. A force so formnidable ensured
its safety. After burnirng a few detached buildings, the
enemy retired without inflicting other injury. One of
their ships, having ninety men on board, was captured by
the Carolinians.
11. In 1715, after several years of profound peace, an
Indian war broke out. All the tribes, from Florida to cape
Fear, had been long engaged in a conspiracy to extirpate
the whites. In the morning of the 15tbh of April, the first
blovw was struck. At Pocataligo, and the settlements
around Port Royal, ninety persons were massacred. The
i.xhabitants of the latter place escaped, by embarking
precipitately on board a vessel, which was then in the
harbor, and sailing directly to Charleston.
12 This massacre was perpetrated by th(e southlern
tvaSOlUJTH-CAROLINA.                  103
Indians. The northern, at the same time, attacked the
settlements near them. Many of the inhabitants were
killed, and many fled to Charleston.' At a plantationL on
Goose creek, seventy wlhites and forty faithful negroes,
being protected by a breast work, determined to maintain
tteir post. On the first attack, their courage failed, and
they agrreed to surrender. rhe instant they were in the
power of the enemny, all were barbarously murdered.
13. Governor Craven, at the head of twelve hundred
men, marched against the savages. He discovered in the
wilderness several small parties, who fled before him. At
Saltcatchers, he found them all assembled, and there an
obstinate and bloody battle was fought. The whites were
victorious, driving the enemy before them, and compelling
them to leave the province. Most of them fled to Florida,
where tby were received, in the most friendly manner, by
the SpariTards.
14. In this short war, four hundred whites were killed,
property of great value destroyed, and a large debt contracted. The proprietors though earnestly solicited, refused
to afford any relief, or to pay any portion of the del)t.
The asserblvy determined to remunerate the colony, by
disposinrg of the land from which the Indians had been
driven. The termins offered were so favorable, that five
hundred Irishmen immediately came over, and planted
themselves' on the frontiers.
15. The proprietors, refiusing to sanction the proceedings
of the assembly, deprived these emigrants of their lands.
Some, reduced to extreme proverty, perished from want,
others resorted to the northern colonies. A strong barrier
between the old settlements an4 the savages, was thus
removed, and the country again exposed to their incursions. Thlle people were exasperated, and longed for a
change of mrasters.
16. The corrupt and oppressive conduct of Trott, the
chief-justice, and Rhett, the receiver-general, increased
the discontent. Of the former, the governor and council
complained to the proprietors, and solicited his recall.
Instead of removing him, they tnanked.him. for his
services, and remnoved the governor and council. Wvith
the governor next appointed, though a man. generally
beloved, the assembly refused to have any concern or
intercourse. They drew up articles of irnmpeachment
agahist Trott, accusing him of corrumption and gross misG 4SOUTH-CAROLINA.
cond'uct, and sent an agent to England, to maintain their
accusation before the proprietors. He was nevertheless
continued in office.
17. The patience of the people was exhlausted, and
they waited only for a favorable opportunity to throw off
their oppressive yoke. In 1719, at a general review cf
the militia at Charleston, occasioned by a threatened invasion of the colony, from Florida,'the officers and soldiers
bound themselves, by a solemn compact, to support each
other in resisting the tyranny of the proprietors; and the
assembly, which was then in session, requested 1the
governor, by a respectful address, to consent to administer
the government in the name of the king.
18. He refused, and by proelam:,tion, disolved thle assembly. The members immnediately mret as a conventioln,
and elected colonel James MAoore their governor. He was
a bold man, and exceedingly well qualified for a porular
leader, in a turbulent seasonr. I{e accepted the appointment, and, assisted by the convention, and supported( by
the people, administered the affairs of the colony.
19. The conduct of the proprietors and peopl)le was
brought before his mnajesty in council. After a fill hearing,
it was decided, that both Colonies should be taken under
the protection of the crown. Several years afterwards,
seven of the proprietors sold to the king their claim to
the soil and rents, and all assigned to him their right of
juirisdiction. The government was subsequently administered by executive officers, appointed by the crown, aiid
by assemblies, chosen by the people, and under their
control the colony prospered.
90. In 1738, occurred an alarming insurrection of the
negroes. A number of them assembled at Stono, su:prised
and killed two men wVho had charge of a ware-house, from
which they took guns and ammunition. They thenr, chose
a     captain, and, with drums beating and colors flying,
marched southvestward     They burned every house on
their way, killed all the whites they could find, and compelled other negroes to join them,
21. Governor Bull, who was returning to Charleston,
from the southward, accidentally met them, hastened out
of their way, and spread an alarm. The news soon reached
Wiltown, where, fortunately, a large congregation were
attending divine service. The men having, according ta
a law   of the province, brouglit their arms to the place
104of worship, marched instantly in quest of the negroes,
who, by this time, had become formidable, and spread
terror and desolation around them.
22. While, in an open field, they were carousing and
dancing, with frantic exultation at their late success, they
were suddenly attacked by the whites.  Some were
killed, the remainder fled. Most of the fugitives were
taken and tried. They who had been compelled to join
the conspirators, were pardoned; but all the leaders and
first insurgents suffered death. About, twenty whites
were murdered.
23. From this period until the era of the revolution, no
important event occurred in the colony. It was sometimes
distressed by Indian wars; but the number of inhabitants
and the means of subsistence and comfort, were constantly
ncreasing. Emrnigrants came principally from the northern
colonies; but often large bodies of protestants arrived
from Europe; in one year, 1752, the number who came
exceeded sixt%en hundred.
CHAPTER XIII.
GEORGIA.
UPON the southern part of the territory included in the
Carolina charter, no settlement was made, until several
years after that charter was forfeited. In June, 1732,
several benevolent gentlemen, in England, concerted a
project for planting a colony in that unoccupied region.
Their principal object was to relieve, by transporting
thither, the indigent subjects of Great Britain; but their
plan of benevolence embraced also the persecuted protestants of all nations.
2. To a project springing from motives so noble and
disinterested, the people and the govermnent extended
their encouragement and patronage. A patent was granted
by the king, conveying to twenty-one trustees the territory
now constituting the state of GEORGIA, which was to be
apportioned gratuitously among the settlers; and liberal
donations were made by the charitable, to defray the
expense of transporting them across the Atlantic, and of
providing for their support the first season.
3. The concerns of the colony were mtuanaged by the
GEORGIA.
105trustees, who freely devoted much of their time to the
undertaking. Among other regulations, they provided,
that the lands should not be sold nor de:'sed by the owners, hbut shouLld descend to the male -children only; they
forbade the use of rum in the colony, and strictly prohihited the importationr of negroes. But none of these regulations remained long in force.
4. In November, 1732, one hundred and thirteen emigrants embarked for Georgia, at the head of whom the
trustees had placed James Oglethorpe, a zealous and active promoter of this scheme of benevolence. In January, they arrived at Charleston; and the Carolinians,
sensible of the advantage of having a barrier between
them and the Indians, gave the adventurers a cordial welcome. They supplied them with provisions, and with
boats to convey them to the place of their destination.
Yamacraw bluff, since called Savalnnah, was selected as
the most eligible place for a settlement.
5. The next year, five or six hundred poor persons arrived, and to each a portion of the wilderness was assigned. But it was soon found that these emigrants,
who were the refuse of cities, had been rendered poor by
idleness, and irresolute by poverty, were not fitted to fell
the mighty groves of Georgia. A race more hardy and
enterprising, was necessary. The trustees, therefore, offered to receive, also, such as had not, by persecution or
poverty, been rendered objects of compassion, and to grant
to all, who should settle in the coloIy, fifty acres of land.
In consequence of this offer, more than four hundred persons, from Germany, Scotland, and Switzerland, arrived
in the year 1735. The Germans settled at Ebenezer,
the Scotch at New-Inverness, now Darien.
6. In 1736, John Wesley, a celebrated methlodist, made
a visit to Georgia, for the purpose of preaching to the colonists, and converting the Indians. He was then young
and ardent, the people around him felt less ardor than
hlimself, and&amp;-his pious zeal soon brought him into collision with.some of the principal settlers. He was accused of diverting the people from their labor to attend his
religious meetings, and of exercising unwarranted ecclesiastical authority. Persecuted by his enemies, and finding he could render no further service to the cause of reigion in the colony, he returned to England, and there,
for many years, pursued a distinguished career of piety
and usefulness.
7. Two years afterwards, George Whitfield, anothei
1O0~
GEORGIA.and more celebrated Methodist, arrived in the colony.
Hle had already made himself conspicuous in England, by
his numerous eccentricities, his ardent piety, his extraor-tivt in prpgt
dinary eloquence, his zeal and activity in propagating his
opinions. FHe camne to Georgia for the benevolent purpose
of establishing an orphlan house, where poor children might
be fed, clothed, and educated in the knowledge of christianity. In prosecution of this purpose, he often crossed
the Atlantic, and traversed Great Britain and America,
soliciting aid from the pious and charitable. Wherever
he went, he preachled, with sincerity and fervor, his peculiar
doctrines, making proselytes of most who heard him, and
foundling a sect which has since become numerous and
respectable. His orphan house, during his lire, did not
flourish, and after his death, was entirely abandoned.
8. In 1740, the trustees rendered an accotLint of their
administration. At that time, two thousand four hundred
and ninety-eight emigrants had arrived in the colony. Of
these, fifteen hundred and twenty-one were indigent Englishmen, or persecuted Protestants. The benefactions,
from government and( from individuals, had been niearly
half a million of dollars; and it was computed that, for
every person transported and maintained by the trustees,
more than three hundred dollars had been expended.
9. The hope which the trustees had cherished, that the
colony, planted at such vast expense, would be prosperous,
and the objects of their benevolence happy, were coinmpletely disappointed.  Such was the character of the
greater part of the settlers, and such the restrictions
imposed, that the plantations languished and continucd to
require the contributions of the charitable.
10. War having been declared against Spain, Mr. Oglethorpe was promoted to the rank of general in the British
army, and at the head of two thousand men, partly from
Virginia and the Carolinas, undertook an expedition against
Florida. He took two Spanish forts and besieged St.
Augustine; but encountering an obstinate resistance, was
compelled to return unsuiccessful to Georgia.
11. Two years afterwards the Spaniards, in retaliatiin,
prepared to invade Georgia; and they intended, if successful thiere, to subjugate the Carolinas and Virginia. On
receiving information of their approach. general Oglethorpe
solicited assistance from South-Carolina. But the inhabitants of that colony, entertaining a strong prejudice against
him, in consequence of his late defeat, and terrified by the
GEORGIA.
107danger which threatened themselves, determined to provide only for their own safety.
12. Meanwhile general Oglethorpe made preparations
for a vigorous defence. He assembled seven hundred
men exclusive of a body Indians, fixed his head quarters
at Frederica, on the island of St. Simnon, and with this
small band, determined to encounter whatever force might
be broughit against him. It.was his utmost hope that lihe
might bet able to resist the enemy until a reinforce~aent
should arrive fromn Carolina, which he daily and anxiously
expected.
13. On the last of June, the Spanish fleet, consisting of
thirty-two sail, and having on board more than thiree
thousand men, came to anchor off St. Simon's bar. Notwithstanding all the resistance which general Oglethorpe
could oppose, they sailed up the river Alatamaha, landed
tpon the island, and there erected fortifications.
14. General Oglethorpe, convinced that his small force,
it' divided, must be entirely inefficient, assembled the
whole of it at Frederica.  One portion he employed in
strengthlieniiig his fortifications; the Highlanders and
Indians, ranging night and day through the woods, often
attacked the out-posts of the enemy. The toil of the
troops, was incessant; and the long delay of the expected
succors, so cruelly withheld by South-Carolina, caused
the mnost gloomy and depressing apprehensions.
15. Learning that the,Spanish army occupied two
distinct positions, Oglethorpe conceived the project of
attacking one by suxprise. HIe selected the bravest of his
little army, and in the night marched, entirely unobserved,
t(o within two miles-of the camp which he intended to assail.
Directing his troops to halt, he advanced, at the head of a
small body, to reconnoitre the enemy. While thus employed, a French soldier of his party, firing his musket,
deserted to the Spaniards. Discovery destroying all hope
of success, the general inmmediately returned to Frederica.
lie was not only chagrifed at this occurrence, but apprehended instant danger from the disclosure which the
deserter would doubtless make of his weakness.
16. In this emrbarrassment, he devised an expedient
which Was attended with the most happy success. He
wrote a letter to the deserter, instructifig him to acquaint
the Spaniards with the defenceless state of Frederica; to
urge themn to attack the place, and if he could not succeed,
to persuade them to remain three days longer on the island;
108
GEORGxIA.for within that timie, according to late advice. from Carlina, lie should receive a reinforcement of two thousand
men and six ships of war. He cautionred him against
dropping any hint of the attack meditated, by admiral
Vernon, uponl St. Augustine, and assured him that the
reward for his services should be ample.
17. For a smiall bribe, a soldier who had been niade
prisoner in one of the numerotius skirmishes, engaged to
deliver this letter to the deserter, and was then set at
liberty. As was foreseenl, he carried it directly to the
Spanish general, who immediately suspected the deserter
to be, a spy from the English camp, and ordereLl himl to
be put in irons. But although his suspicions were awakened, he was yet unrcertain whether the whole might not
be a stratagem of his antagonist.
18. While hesitating what to believe, three small vessels
of war appeared off the coast. Supposing they brought
the reinforcemnents alluded to in the letter to the deserter,
he hesitated no longer, but determined to make a vigorous
attack upon the English, before these reiniforcemnents
could arrive and be brought into action.
19. General Oglethorpe, by mere accident, obtained
informiation of their design. A small party was inst.ntly
placed ini ambuseadle, the Spaniiiards advanced near them,
hlalted to rest, and laid aside their arms. A sudden and
well directed fire, killing many, threw tihe enemy into
confision. After a few more discharges, they fled to their
fortifications, which they demolished, and, hastily embarking, made every possible effort to escape from the
reinforcements that were supposed to be approaching.
20. Thus was Georgia, with trifling loss, delivered from
the most irnminent danger. General Oglethorpe not only
retrieved, but exalted his reputation. From the Carolinians, grateful for their preservation, and from the governors
of most of the northern colonies, hle received cordial coni
gratulations upon his address and good fortune. And so
mortified were the Spaniards at the result-of the expedition,
that thile commander, on his return, was arrested, tried, and
cashiered for misconduct.
21. But the prosperity of the colony was retarded by
these disturbances.  For ten years longer, it remained
under thie management of the trustees, who, embarrassing
it by too much regulation, discouraged the emigrants anIi
checked its growth.  At length, disappointed in their
hopes, and wearied by complaints, they surrendered their...E S.~~~~I

of England, on an expedition of discovery, in the same direction. In June, 1497, they arrived( at thie island of Nw
foundland, in North America, and, proceeding westward,
soon after reached the continent. It being their object
also to find a direct passage to the East Indies, they first
sailed northwardly in search of it, as far as the 57th degree of latitude; then, returning, cruised along the coast
to East Florida; and thence sailed to England without
having made any settlement. Upon the discoveries made
in this voyage the English folmded their claim to the eastern portion of North America.
19. In 1499, Alonza de Ojeda, a companion of Columbus in his first expedition, sailing under the patronage of
several Portuguese merchants, discovered the continent
at Paria, in tihe 5th degree of north latitude. Americus
Vespucius, a Florentine gentleman who accompanied him,
published, on his return, an account of the voyage and a
description of the country whichrthey had visited; and
from him it derives the name it hears.
20. In 1504, several adventurous navigators, from different parts of France, camne, in small vessels, to fish on
the banks of Newfound(land. In 1524, John Verrazzano,
a Florentine, in the employment of the king of France,
sailed along the coast of America, from Florida to the 50th
degree of north latitude. He is supposed to have entcred
the harbour of New-York. He made, the next year, another voyage, from which he never returned, nor is it known
by what disaster he perished.
21. During the next forty years, frequent voyages were
made to the coast of North Amnerica. Of some, the object
was fishing; of others, trade with the natives. In 1540,
the French made an attempt to plant a colony in Canada,
which was unsuccessful.
22. The religious wars wlhich afflicted France in the
lsixteenth century, ind(luced that illustrious statesman, Jas
per Coligni, the head of the Protestant sect, to project, in
1502, a settlement in America, to) which his brethren
might retire from the persecution of the Catholics. Fitting out two ships, hlie sent them thither under thte command of John Ribaut, who landed at a place supposed to
be within the limits of South Carolina, built a fort, left a
part of his men, and returned to France.
23. The men who were left, soon after mutinied, killed
their commander, built and equipped a vessel and put to

TrE treaty of Aix la Chapelle coDncluded in 1748, between
E.agland arid France, restored tranquillity to America. -At
this period, thie numnber o   inhabitatts in the tlhirteent

havin-g discovered the river Mississippi, they claimed the
fertile atid deliglhtfil valley thlrough whlich it runs, and
the whole country watered I)y its tributary streamns.
2. T'hey at length determined to connect their inorthern
and soulthern settlements by a chain of posts extendiig,
along the frontiers of the English, friom Lake Ontario to
the Ohio, and( down that river and thie MAississilpp)i to NewOrleans. While they were intent on this project, a company of Eniglish traders, having obtained fi'oni the kiting a
grant of land, established trading-houses on the banks of
the Ohio.
3. The French seized some of these trad(ers and conveyed them prisoners to Canada. The (ompany complained
to governor Dinwiddie, of Virrinia. The land havirg been
granted as a part of that colony, he determiined to send_a

Ohio, and require him to witthdiaw his troops. For this
mnission he selected George Washington, who was then

4. To the letter of Dinwiddie, the French cormmalnder
replied, that he had taklien possession cof the country in
pursuance of directions from his general, then in Canada,
to whomn h-. vould transmit the letter, and whose orders
he should ir.,icitly obey. This reply nIot being satisfa.ctory
to the governror, preparations were made in Virginid, to
maintain by foree the rilghts of the British crown. Trroops,
constituting a regiment, were raised, the conrmriand of
whom, on the death of the colonel first appointed, was
given to Mr. Washington.
5. At the head of about fobur hundred men, he advanced,
~arlv in the spring, into the territory in dispute. Onl llis
-oute, le met, attacked, and defeated, a French party
inder the command of one Dijonville, wiho appronched himn
n a manner irndicating hostile intentions. He proceedIed
tiowards fort Du Quesne, situated at the junction of the
Alleghanlv an)d Monongahlela. From this fort, De Villier,.t t}le head ot niie hundred men, marched out to attack hLirn.
6. Hearing of the a pproatlri of tlhis party. colon-el
Washin-ton halted, and hastily erected some inmperfect
w-rklis, by mreans of which lie lopedi to proloonr hlis dfence
ulitil ttie arrival of reinfo erncements.  te was closely
besieged b)y De Villier, but inaking an obstinate deftence,
airs offered the most honorable ternms of capitulation.
These hie accepted, and returned with his reginient to
Virginia.
7. In this year, delegates fromn seven of the colonies
met at Albany, for the purpose of holdingr a confierence
with the Six Nations of Indians. This business being
finished, a confederation of the colonies was proposed byv
the deleg,ates from Massachusetts. A " Plan of UJnioli'
wvas agreed upon, to be subnitted to the colonial le.risla.
tures, and to parliameniit, for their adoption.
8. This plan provided that delegates to a General
Council should be choser by the sepresentatives of the
people, in the colonial assemblies, and that a presidentgeneral should be appointed by the crown. This council
was to possess the control of the military torce of the
confederacy, and the power to concert all measures for the
conmnon protection and safety. The president-gereral was
to hlave a negative up(on the proceedings of the delegates.112    FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63.
9. This plan was rejected by parliament, because the
delegates were to be chosen by the representatives of the
people. It was rejected by the colonies, because it pl3ced
too much power in the hands of the king. In Englandl,
apprehensions were already entertained of the growing
importance of the colonial assemblies. In America, the
people began, perhaps unconsciously, to be actuated by
the spirit of independence.
10. The conducet of the French, on the Ohio, convinced]
the cabinet of London that their claim to the country,
through which that river flows, must be relinquished, or
maintained by the sword. They did not hesitate which
alternative to choose. Early in the spring of 1755, they
despatched general Braddock to America, with a respecta.
ble force, to expel the French, and keep possession of the
territory. And preparations having been made by France
to despatch a reinforcement to her armies in Canada,
admiral Boscawen was ordered to endeavour to intercepl
the French fleet before it should enter the gulf of St.
Lawrence.
11. In April, general Braddock met thle governors of
the several provinces, to confer upon the plan of tht
ensuing campaign. Three expeditions were resolved upon t
one against Du Quesne, to be commanded by general
Braddock; one against forts N  C a and Frontinac, to be
commanded by governor Shirle, and one against Crown
Point, to be commanded by general Johnlson. The last
mentioned post was the nearest to New-England of any
in the possession of the enemy; and from it almost all the
Indian parties, which had, in the late wars, so cruelly
harassed the northiern colonies, were despatched and sup.
ported. The expedition against it was proposed and urged
by Massachusetts, and was to be executed by colonial
troops, raised in New-England and New-York.
12. While preparations were making for these expeditions, another, which had been previously concerted, was
carried en against the French forces in Nova Scotia.
This province was settled by the French, but was ceded
to the English by the treaty of Utrecht. Its boundaries
not having been defined, the French continued to occuipy
a portion of the territory claimed by the English, and had
built forts for their defence. To gain possession of these
was the object of the expedition.
13. About two thousaniid militia, commanded by colonel
Winslow- embarked at boston; and being joined on their
[I75S.1755.]   FRENCH WAR OF 1754--63.
passage by three hundred regulars, arrived, in April, at
the piace of destination. The forts were invested; the
resistance made was trifling and ineffectual; and in a short
time the English gained entire possession of the province,
according to their own definition of its boundaries. Three
only of their men were killed.
14. The preparations of general Braddock, in Virginia,
had proceeded slowly. It had been founrd extremely difficult to procure horses, wagons, and provisions. Impatient of delay, he determined to set' out with twelve
hLundred men, selected from the different corps, and to.roceed, as rapidly as possible, towards fort Du Quesne.'The residue of the army, and the heavy baggage, were left.toder the command of colonel Dunbar, who was directed
~,J follow as soon as the preparations were completed.
15. Braddock had been educated in the English army;
i.id in the science of war, as then taught in Europe, he:eserved and enjoyed the reputation of more than ordinary
skill. Of this reputation he was vain, and disdained to, onsider that his skill was totally inapplicable to the mode
f warfare practised in the forests of America. Before he
hft England, he was repeatedly admonished to beware of
a surprise; and on his march through the wilderness, the
[ rovincial officers frequently entreated him to scour the sur-.iounding thickets. But he held these officers and the enemay in too much contempt to listen to this salutary counsel.
16. On approaching fort Du Quesne, colonel Washington, who accompanied him as his aid, made a last attempt
to induce him to change his order of march. He explained
the Indian mode of warfare; represented his danger; and
offered to take command of the provincials and place himself ip advance of the army. This offer was declined.
The general proceeded, confident of the propriety of his
conduct; the provincials followed, trembling for the consequences.
17. On the ninth of July, the army crossed the Mononahela, within a few miles of Du Quesne. Their route
led through a defile, which they had nearly passed, when
a tremendous yell and instantaneous discharge of fire arms
suddenly burst upon them from an invisible foe. The van
was thrown into confusion. The general led the main
body to its support. For a moment, order was restored,
and a short cessation of the enemy's fire, occasioned by
the death of their commander, sedmed to indicate that all
danger was over.
H.
113114        FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63.                [1755.
18. But the attack was soon renewed with increased
ftury. Concealed behind trees, logs, and rocks, the Indians
poured upon the troops a deadly anid incessant fire. Officers
and men fell thickly around, and the survivers knew not
where to direct their aim to revenge their slaughtered
comrades. The whole body was again thrown into con.
fusion, The general, obstinate and courageous, refused
to retreat, but bent his whole efforts to restore and maintain order. He persisted in these efforts, until five horses
had been shot under him, and every one of his officers on
horseback, except colonel Washington, was either killed
or wounded...
19. The genseral at length fell, and the rout became
universal, The troops fled precipitately until they met
the division under Dunbar, then sixty miles in the rear.
To this body the same panic was communicated. Turning about, they fled with the rest, and although no enemy
had been seen during the engagement, nor afterwards, yet
the army continued retreating until it reached firt Cuinberland, one hundred and twenty miles from the place of
action. There they remained -but a short time. With
the remnant of the army, amounting to fifteen hundred
men, colonel Dunbar, upon whom, on the death of Braddock, the command devolved, marched to Philadelphia,
leaving the frontiers of Pennsyivania and Virginia destitute
of defence.
20. The provincial troops, whom Braddock had so much
despised, displayed, during the battle, the utmost calmness
and courage. Though placed in the rear, they alone, led
on by Washington, advanced against the Indians and
covered the retreat. Had they been permitted to fight in
their own way, they could easily have defeated the enemy.
In this battle, sixty-four, out of eighty-five officers, were
either killed or wounded, and at least one half of the
privates.
21. The two northern expeditions, though not so disastrous, were both unsuccessful. General Shirley, who had
been appointed to command that against Niagara, met with
so many delays that he did not reach Oswego until late in
August.  While embarking tihere to proceed against
Niagara, the autumnal rains began, his troops became
discouraged, his Indian allies deserted him, and he was
compelled to relinquish his design.
22. The forces destined to attackli Crown Point, and the
requisite military stores, could not be collected at AIhany1755.,    FRENCIH WAR OF 1754-63.
until the last of August. Thence the army, under the
command of general Johnson, proceeded to the south end
of Lake George, on their way to the place of destination.
There he learned, that the armament, fitted out in the
p, I-s of France, eluding the English squadron, had arrived
at Quebec, and that baron Dieskau, comnmander of the
French forces, was advancing with an army towards the
territories of the English. He halted, erected slight breastworks, and detached colonel Williams with a thousand
men, to impede the progress of the enemy.
23. D:eskau, who was near, was immediately informed
of the approach of this detachment. Without losing a
moment, he directed his troops to conceal themselves.
The English advanced into the midst of their enemy, and,
from every q(uarter, received, at the same moment, a sudden
and unexpected fire. Their leader fell, and the men fled,
in disorder, to the camp.
24.'rhey were followed closely by the enemy, who
approached within one hlundred and fifty yards of the
breastwork: and, had they made an immediate assault,
would probably, such was the panic of' the English, have
been successful. But here they halted, to mnake dispositions for a regular attack. The Indians and Canadians
were despatched to the flanks, and the regular troops
began the attack with firing, by platoons, at the centre.'rheir fire was ineffectual, and the provincials gradually
resumed their courage.
25. A few discharges of the artillery drove the Canadians and Indians to the swamps. The regulars, although
dleserted by the auxiliaries, maintained the conflict for
more than an hour, with much steadiness and resolution.
Dieskau, convinced that all his efforts must be unavailing,
then gave orders to retreat. This produced some confusion, which, being perceived by the provincials, they
simtl1taneously, and withlout orders or concert, leaped over
the intrenchbments, fell upon the French soidiers, and
killed, captured, or dispersed thlem.  The baron was
wounded and made prisoner.
26. The next day, colonel Blanchard, who commanded
at fort Edward, despatched captain Folsom, of NewHampshire, with two hundred men, to the assistance pf
general Johnson. On his way, he discovered between
three and four hundred of the enemy seated around a pond:
not far from the place where colonel Williams had been
defeated. Not"with standing. his inferiority in numbers, he
11 2
115116       FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63.                [1756.
determined to attack them. So impetuous was the onset,
that, after a sharp conflict, the enemy fled. In the several
engagements, the provincials lost about two hundred men;
the, enemy upwards of seven hundred.
- 27. General Johnson, though strongly importuned by the
government of Massachusetts, refused to proceed upon his
expedition, which was abandoned, and most of his troops
returnel to their respective colonies. Thus ended the
campaign of 1755. It opelned with the brightest prospects,
immense preparations had been made, yet not one of the
objects of the three great expeditions had been attained.
28. Durinig the fall and winter, the southern colonies
were ravaggd, and the usual barbarities perpetrated upon
the frontier inhlabitants, by the savages, who, on the defeat
of Braddock, and the retreat of his army, saw nothing to
restrain their fury. In Virginia and Pennsylvania, disputes existed between the governors and legislatures,
which prevented all attention to the nmeans of defence.
Scarcely a post was maintained, or a soldier emrnployed in
their service.
29. The colonies, far from being discouraged by the
misfortunes of the last campaign, determined to renew and
increase their exertions. General Shirley, to whom the
superintendence of all the mnilitary operations had been
confided, assembled a council of war at New-York, to
concert a plan for the ensuing year. lIe -proposed that
expeditions should be carried on against Du Quesne,
Niagara, and Crown Point, and that a body of troops
should be sent, by the way of the rivers Kennebec and
Chaudiere, to alarm the French for the safety of Quebec.
This plan was unanimously adopted by the council.
30. Shirley, on the last of January, returned to Boston,
to meet the assembly of Massachusetts, of which colony
he was governor. He endeavored to persuade themn to
concur in the measures proposed; but, disgusted witi the
p)roceedings of the last campaign, and especially at general
Johnson's neglecting to pursue his advantages, they were
unwilling to engage in offensive operations, unless the
command of their forces should be given to general Winslow, who had acquired popularity by his success in Nova
Scotia. Their wishes were comnplied with, and their
concurrence was then granted.
31. In April, news arrived from Great Britain, that the
conduct of general Johnson, instead of being censured,
was considered highly meritoriu(s; that, as a reward faT1756.]    FRENCH NVWAR OF 1754-63.
his sucoess, the king had conferred upon him the title of
lbaronet, and parliament a grant of five thousand pounds
sterling; that his majesty disapproved of the conduct of
shirley, and had determined to remove him frors command.
32. This information not being official, general Shirley
(ontinued his preparations with his usual activity-and zeal.
While engaged in collecting, at Albany, the troops from
I he different colonies, general Webb brought from England
official information of his removal. On the 25th of June,
general Abercrombie arrived, and took command of the
aimy. It now consisted of about twelve thousand men,
ald was more numerous and better prepared for the field
tlhan any army that had ever been assembled in America.
33. Singular as it may appear, while this sanguinary
war raged in America, the intercourse between the two
iitions in Europe, not only continued uninterrupted, but
s.eemed more than usually friendly. This unnatural state
ot things could not long continue. Great Britain declared
u ar in May, and France in June.
34. The change of commanders delayed the operations
of the English army. The French were active; and on
I he 12th of July, general Abercrombie received intelligence
t lLat they meditated an attack upon Oswego, a post of the
iLmost importance. General WVebb was ordered to pre.
)are to march with a regiment for the defence of that place.
tl the mean time, lord Loudon, who had been appointed
commander-in-chief over all the British forces in the
colonies, arrived in America.
35. Amidst the ceremonies which followed, the affairs
tf the war were forgotten. General Webb did not begin
hliis march until the 12th of August. Before he had proeeeded far, he learned that Oswego was actually besieged
by a large army of French and Indians. Alarmed for his
own safety, he proceeded no farther, but emnployed his
roops in erecting fortifications for their defence.
36. General Montcalm, the comminander of the French
1 roops in Canada, began the siege of Oswego on the 12th,f August. On the 14th, the English commander having
lbeen killed, terms of surrender were proposed by the garrison, and were agreed to. These terms were shamefully
violated. Several of the British officers and soldiers were
insulted, robbed, and massacred by the Indians. Most of
the sick were scalped in the hospitals, and the French
general delivered twenty of the garrison to the savages,
that being the number they had lost during the siege.
H13
117II8       FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63i                [1757
Those unhappy wretches were, doubtless, accordiniig to
the Indian custom, tortured and burnt.
37. Gel.eral Webb was permitted to retreat., unmolested,
to Albany. Lord Loudon pretended it was now too l?te
in the season to attempt any thing farther, though the
troops under general Winslow were within a few days
march of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and were sufficient in number to justify an attack upon those places.
He devoted the remainder of the season to making preparatiofis for an early and vigorous campaign the ensuting
year.
38. This spring had opened with still more brilliant
prospects than the last; and the season closed without
the occurrence of a single event that was honorable to
the British arms, or advantageous to the colonies. This
wvant of success was justly attributed to the removal of
the provincial officers, who were well-acquainted with the
thleatre of operations, but whom the ministry, desirous
of checking the growth of talents in the colonies, were
unwilling to emniploy. Yet the several assemblies, thoug!
they saw themselves thus slighted, and their money
annually squandered, made all the preparations that were
required of themn for the next camrpaign.
39. The reduction of Louisburghl was the ohject to
whi'ch the ministrV directed the attention of lord Lou(don.
In the spring of 1757, he sailed from New-York, with
6000 men, and, at Halifax, met admiral Holbourn, with
transports containing an e(lual number of troops,:and a
naval force consisting of fifteen ships of the line. When
about-to proceed to their place of destination, intelligence
arrived that the garrisoni at Louisburgh had received( a
large reinforcement, and expected and desired a visit froml
the English. Disheartened by this intelligence, the general and admiral abandoned the expedition.
40. While the English commaniders were thlus irres,lute and idle, the French were enterprising and act.
In March, general Montcalhn made an attempt to surpria
fort William Henry, at the south end of Lake George,
but was defeated by the vigilance and bravery of the
garrison. He returned to Crown Point, leaving a party
of troops at Ticonderoga. Against this post, near four
hlundred men were sent fromi the fort, under the commanid
of colonel Parke.r.
41. The colonel was deceived in his intelligence, decoyed into an ambuscade, and attacked withl such fuiry,119
17574}   FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63.
that but two officers and seventy privates escaped, Encouraged by this success, Montcalm determined to return
and besiege fort William Henry. For this purpose, lie,
assembled an army consisting of regular troops, Canadians
and Indians, and amounting to near ten thousand lnen.
42. Major Putnam, a brave and active partizan, obtained
information of the purposes of Montcalm, which he comntLunicated to general Webb, who, in the absence of lord
Loudon, commanded the British troops in that quarter.
The general enjoined silence upon Putnam, and adopted
no,ther measure, on roceiving the intelligence, than
sending colonel Monro to take command of the fort.
43. The day after this officer, ignorant of what was
to happen, had arrived at his post, the lake appeared;
covered with boats, which swiftly appro-,ched the shore.
Montcalm, with but little opposition, effected a landing,
and immediately began the siege. The garrison, consisting
of two thousand five hundred men, animated by the expectation of relief, made a gallant defence.
44. General Webb had an army at fort Edward, of
more than four thousand men, and it was in his power to
call in a large number of provincial troops from NewYork and New-England. To him colonel Monro sent
repeated and pressing solicitations for immnediate succor.
These he disregarded, seeming entirely indifferent to the
distressing situation of his fellow soldiers.
45. At length, on the ninth day of the siege, in compliance with the entreaties of the friends of Monro,
eneral Webb despatchled Sir William Johnson, withl a
body of men, to his relief. They had not proceeded
three miles, when the order was countermanded. Webb
then wrote to Monro that he could afford him no assistance, and advised him to surrender on the best terms
that he could obtain.
46. This letter was intercepted by Montcalm, who, in
a conference which he procured, handed it himself to the
commnander of the fort. All hope of relief being extinguished, articles of capitulation were agreed to. In
these it was expressly stipulated by Montcalm, that the
prisoners should be protected from the savages, by a guard,
and that the sick and wounded should be treated with
humaniity.
47. But thle next morning, a great number of Indians,
having been permitted to enter the lines, began to plutnder.
Meeting with no oppositionr, they fell upon the sick and
1H419          fINTRODUCTION.
their provisions, one of their number, who consented to be
madea victim to save his comrades, was killed and eaten.
A few days afterwards, they were taken up by an English
vessel and carried to England. This was the first attempt
to plant a colony within the limits of the United States:
and it is worthy of remark, that to secure an asylum from
religious persecution was the object in view. Coligni afterwards sent a party to Florida, who were treacherously
massacred by the Spaniards.
24. In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, having received
from queen Elizabeth a grant of such "remote, heathen,
and barbarous lands" as he might discover and occupy,
fitted out a squadron of five ships, and sailed for America.
On arriving before St. John, in Newfoundland, he found
thirty-six vessels fishing in the harbor. He landed and
tnok possession of the country in the name of his sovereign.
Oni his return to England, he suffered shipwreck and
perished.
25. The next year, Sir Walter Raleigh, distinguished
in the history of England as a gallant knight and as tlhe
favorite of the queen, obtained a renewal of the patent
gra.ted to Sir Humphrey, who was his half brother, and
despatched to America two shlips commanded by captains
Amidas and Barlow. They first landed on an island in
the inlet to Pamplico sound, then proceeded to the isle of
Roanoke at the mouthof Albemarle sound, in North Carolina, and at both places were treated with great respect by
the natives.
26. Having freighted their ships with furs, sassafras
and cedar, they returned to England, where they published
iriarvellous accounts of the beauty of the country, the fertility of the soil, the mildness of the climate, and the innocence of thle natives. The queen was so charmed with
the description, that, as a memorial that the country had
been diseovered during the reign of a virgin queen, she
calted it Virginia.
27. The next year, Raleigh sent from England seven
vessels, commanded by Sir Richard Grenville, and carrying upwards of one hundred persons, destined to begin a
settlement. They were left under Ralph Lane, on Roa.
noke island. The success of the Spaniards in finding gold
in South America, led these adventurers to employ their
time in a fruitless search for it here. In 1586, they were
visited by Sir Francis Drake, who, at their request, conveyed them back to Ergland. Lane carrying home a120       FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63                 [1758.
wounded, whom they immediately massacred. This excited their ap etite for carnage. The defenceless troops
were surrounded and attacked with fiend-like fury. Monro,
hastening to Montcalmy implored him to provide the
stipulated guard.
48. -His entreaties were ineffectuaI, and the massacre
proceeded. All was turbulence and horror. On every
side, savages were butchering and scalping their wretcheo
victims. Their hideous yells, the groans of the dying,
and the frantic shrieks of others, shrinking from tlhe
iplifted tomahawk, were heard by the French unmoved.
The fury of the savages were permitted to rage witlIout
restraint, until a large number were killed, or hurried
captives into the wilderness.
49. The day after this awful tragedy, major Putnam
was senit, with his rangers, to watch the motionis of.the
enemy. When he came to the shore of the lake, their
rear was hardly beyond the reach of musket shot. The
prospect was shocking and horrid. The fort was demolished. The barracks and buildings were yet burning.
Innumerable fragments of human carcases still broiled in
the decaying fires. Dead bodies, mangled with tomahawks
and scalping knives, in all the wantonness of Indian barbarity, were every where scattered around.
50. General Webb, apprehensive of an attack upon
himself, sent expresses to the provinces for reinforcements. They were raised and despatched with expedition;
but as Montcalm returned to Ticonderoga, they were kept
in service but a few weeks. And thus ended the third
campaign in America.
51. These continual disasters resulted from folly and
mismanagement, rathler than from want of means and
military strength. The British nation was alarmed and
indignant, and the Iking found it necessary to change his
councils. At the head of the new ministry, he placed
the celebrated William Pitt, who rose, by the force of
his talenrts alone, from the humble post of ensign in the
giards, to the control of the dest'nies of a mighty empire.
Public confidence revived, and the nation seemed inspired
with new life and vigor.
52. For the next campaign, the ministry determined
upon three expeditions; one of twelve thousand men
against Louisburgh; one of sixteen thousand against
Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and one of eight thousanid
against fort Du Quesie. The colonies were called upon121
1758,]   FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63.
to render all the assistance in their power. Lord Loudon
having been recalled, the command of the expedition
against Louisburgh was given to general Amherst, under
whom general Wolfe served as a brigadier. The place
was invested on the 12th of June. Amherst made his
approaches with much circumspection; and, without any
memorable incident, the siege terminated, on the 26th
of July, by the. surrender of the place. Whenever an
opportunity occurred, general Wolf, who was then young,
displayed all that fire, impetuosity, and discretion, which
afterwards immortalized his name.
53. The expedition against Ticonderoga, was commanded by general Abercrombie. He was accompanied
by Lord Howe, whose military talents and amiable virtues
made him the darling of the soldiery. This army consisted
of seven thousand regular troops, and ten thousand provincials.  When approaching the fort, a skirmish took
place with a small party of the enemy, in which lord
Howe was killed at the first fire. On seeing him fall, the
troops moved forward with an animated determination to
avenge his death. Three hundred of the enemy were killed
on the spot, and one hunidred and forty made prisoners.
54. The ardor of his men, and the intelligence gained
from the prisoners, induced general Abercrombie to make
an assault upon the works. It was received with undaunted bravery, and was persevered in with singular
obstinacy. For four hours, the troops remained before
the walls, attempting to scale them, and exposed to a
destructive fire of musketry and artillery. The- general,
despairing of success, then directed a retreat. Near two
thousand of the assailants were killed or wounded. The
loss of the French was not great, and most of the killed
were shot through the head, the other parts of their
bodies being protected by their works.
55. After this bloody repulse, Abercrombie despatched
colonel Bradstreet, with three thousand men, mostly
provincials, against fort Frontenac, which was situated
on Lake Ontario, and contained a large quantity of merchandise, provisions, and military stores. It fell an easy
conquest, and the loss was severely felt by the French.
The western Indians, not receiving their usual supply of
merchandise, relaxed in their exertion~; and the troops
at Du Quesne suffered from the want of the provisions and
military storks. These circumstances contributed essentially to facilitate the operations of the third expeditio.
L22   FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63.               [1759.
56. This was placed under the command of general
Forbes. He left Philadelphia in the beginniig of Jully
and, after a laborious march, through deep morasses and
over unexplored mountains, arrived at Raystown, ninety
miles from Du Quesne. An advanced party of eight
hundred men, under the command of major Grant, was
me+ by a detachment from the fort, and defeated, with
great slaughter.
57. Forbes, undismayed by this disaster, advanced with
cautious and steady perseverance. The enemy, observing
his circumspection, determined not to abide the event of
a siege. After dismantling the fort, they retired down the
Ohio, to their settlements on the Mississippi. General
Forbes, taking possession of the place, changed its name
to Pittsburgh.
58. The campaign of 1758, was highly honoralbe to the
British arms. Of the three expeditions, two had completely succeeded, and the leader of the third had made an
important conquest. To the commanding talents of Pitt,
and the confidence which they inspired, this change of
fortune must be attributed; and in no respect were these
talents more strikingly displayed, than in the choice of
men to execute his plans.
59. Encouraged by the events of this year, the Englishl
anticipated still greater- success in the campaign which
was to follow. The plan marked outt by the minister,
was indicative of the boldness and energy of his genius.
Three different armies were, at the same time, to be led
against the three strongest posts of the French in America;
Niagara, Ticonderoga, and Quebec. The latter post was
considered the strongest; and it was therefore intended
that, should Ticonderoga be conquered, the victorious
army should press forward to assist in its reduction.
60. In the beginning of July, general Prideaux embarked
on Lake Ontario, with the army destined against Niagara,
and, on the sixth, landed about three miles from the fort.
He immnediately commenced a siege, in the progress of
which he was killed, by the bursting of a shell. The
command devolved upon Sir William Johnson. An army
of French and Indians approaching soon after, he detached
a part of his forces to meet them. A battle ensued; the
English gained the victory, which was followed by the
surrender of the fort.
61. General Amherst, to whom was assigned the expe.
dition against Ticonderoga, found so many difficulties to1759.J    FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63.                   123
surmount, that he was unable to present himself before
that place until late in July. It was immediately abandoned by the enemy. The British general, after repairing
the works, proceeded against Crown Point.   On his
approach, this was also deserted, the enemy retiring to the
Isle aux Noix. To gain possession of.this post, great
efforts were made, and much time consumed; but a succession of storms on Lake Champlain, prevented success.
General Amherst was compelled to lead back his army to
Crown Point, where he encamped for the winter.
62. The expedition against Quebec, was the most daring
and important. That place, strong by nature, had been
made still stronger by art, and had received the appropriate
appellation of the Gibraltar of America. Every expedition
against it had failed. It was now commanded by Montcalm, an officer of distinguished reputation; and an attempt
to reduce it must have seemed chimerical to any one but
Pitt. He judged, rightly, that the boldest an(d most dan-.
gerous enterprises are often the most successful. They
arouse the energies of man, and elevate them to a level
with tlhe dangers and difficutlties to be encountered, especially when committed to ardent minds, glowNing with
enthusiasm, and emuloLs of glory.
63. Such a mind he bad discovered in general Wolfe,
whose conduct at Louisburgh had attracted his attention.
Hle appointed himn to conduct the expedition, and gave him
for assistants, brigadier generals Moncton, Tow,nshend,
and Murray; all, like himself, yoiung and ardent. ]Early
in the season, he sailed ftron Halifax, with eight thoutsaind
troops, and, near the last of June, landcled the whole army
on the island of Orleans, a few miles belowv Quebec.
64. Fromrn this position he could takle a near and distinct
view of the obstacles to be overcome.'hese'were so
great, that even the bold and sanauine WVolfe perceived
more to fear than to hope. In a letter to Mr. Pitt, written
before commencinig operations, he declared that he saw
but little prospect of reducing the place.
65. Quebec stands on the north si(ldeof the St. Lawrence,
and consists of an upper and lower town. Tlhe lower s'own
lies between the river and a bold and lofty eminence,
which runs parallel to it, far to the westward. At the top
of this eminence is a plain, upon which the upper townl is
situated. Below, or east of the city, is the river St.
Charles, whose channel is rough, and whose banks are
steep and broken. A short distance farther down, is the124        FRENCH WAR OF 1754-63.                [1759.
river Montmorency; and between these two rivers, andi
reaching from one to the other, was encamped the French
army, strongly entrenched and at least equal in-number to
that of the English.
66. General Wolfe took possession of Point Levi, orc
the bank of the river opposite Quebec, and from that positlon cannonaded the town. Some injury wvas done to the
houses, but his cannon were too distant to makle any
impression upon the works of the enemy. He resolved to
quit this post, to land below Montmorency, and passing that
river, to attack the French general in hlis entrenrchments.
67. He succeeded in landing his troops, and, with a
portion of his army, crossed the Montmorency. A partial
engagement took place, in which the French obtained the
advantage. Relinquishing this plan, he then determined,
in concert with the admiral, to destroy the'French shipping
and magazines. Two attempts were unsuccessful; a third
was more fortunate, yet but little was effected. At this
juncture, intelligence arrived that Niagara was taken, that
Ticonderoga and Crown Point had been abandoned, but
that general Amherst, instead of pressing forward to their
assistance, was preparing to attack the Isle aux Noix.
68. Wolfe rejoiced at the triumph of his brethren in
arms, but could not avoid contrasting their success with
his own ill fortune. His mind, alike lofty and susceptible,
was deeply impressed by the disasters at Montmorency;
and the extreme chagrin of his spirits, preying upon his
delicate frame, sensibly affected his- health. He was
observed frequently to sigh; and, as if life was only valuable while it added to his glory, he declared to his intimate
friends, that he would not survive the disgrace which he
imagined would attend the failure of his enterprise.
69. Despairing of success below the town, he next
directed his efforts towards effecting a landing above it.
He removed a part of his army to Point Levi, and the
remailider higher up the river. He now found that, on
this quarter, the fortifications were not strong; and
discovered that the heights behind themn mighli possibly
be gained, by ascending the precipice in a narrow path
whicht was defended only by a captain's guard.
70. The difficulties attending this enterprise were numerouls. The current was rapid, the shore shelvirng, the only
landing place so narrow that it might easily be missed in
the dark, and the steep above, such as troops, even when
unopposed, could not ascend without difficulty. Yet the125
1759.]     FRUINUR wVvAn wr U-r  
plan, though bold and hazardous, was well adapted to the
desperate situation of affairs, and was determined on.
71. To conceeal. their intention, the admiral retired several leagues up the river. During the evening, a strong
detachment was put on board the boats, and moved silently
down with the tide, to the place of landing, where they
arrived an hour before daybreak. Wolfe leaped on shore,
was followed by the troops, and all instantly began, with
the assistance of shrubs and projecting rocks, to climnb up
the precipice. The guard was dispersed, and, by the dawn
of day, the whole army gained the heights of Abraham,
where the different corps were formed uider theiir respective leaders.
72. Moutcalm. at first. could not believe that the Eng
tsh had ascended the heights. When convinced of the;,ct, he comprehended the full advantage they had gained.
Hte saw that a battle was inevitable, and prepared for it
with promptness and courage.  Leaving his camp at
Ndontmorency, he advanced towards the English army,
whieh was formed in order of battle to receive him.
73. The French advanced brisly.'The English re-erved their fire until the enemy were near, and then gave
tt with decisive effect. Early in the engagement, Wolfe
was wounded in the wrist, but, preserving his composure,
he continued to eniicourage lis troops. Soon after, he
received a shot in the groin. Trlis painful wound he also
concealed, placed himself at the head of the grenadiers,
and was leading them to the charge, when he received a
third and mortal wound.
74. Undismayed by the fall of their general, the English
continued their exertions under Moncton, who, in a short
time, was hl rmselfwouinded, and the command devolved upon
Townshend. About the same time, Montcalm received a
mortal wound, and tb.e second in command also fell. The
left wiiig and cenltre of the French gave way. Part were
driven into Quebec, and part over the river St. Charles.
75. On receiving his mortal wound, Wolfe was con
reyed into the rear, where, careless about himnself, he
discovered, in the agonies of death, the most anxious
solicitude concerning the fate of the day. From extremo
faintness, he had reclined his head on the arm of an office'r,
but was soon aroused by the cry of, "they fly, they fly."' W'ho fly." exclaimed the dying hero. "The French,"
answered his attendant. "Then," said he, "I die contented' and immediately expired. A death so glorious,

and attended by circumstances so interesting, has seldom
beert recorded in history.
76. Five days after the battle, the city surrendered
and received an English garrison.'hlie French concentrated their remaining forces at Montreal, and, early in the'
spring, made atteminpts to regain possession of Quebec.
Unsuccessful in these, they returned to Montreal, towards
which the whole British force in America, under the comniand uf general Amherst, was approaching. This force
was too strong to be resisted. In September, 1760, that
city surrendered, and soon after all the French posts in
Canada fell into the power of the English.
77. In the other parts of the world, their arms were
equally successful; and, at the comnmencerment of 1763, a
peace, highly advantageous to their interests, was coincluded at Paris. By the treaty, France ceded to Great
Britain all her northern settlements in America, which
relieved the colonies from the continual dread of savage
incursions.
CHAPTER XV.
REVOLUTION.
IN the late brilliant contest, England had made unprecedented exertions. At its close, she fopnd that, though
she had encircled her name with glory, and added extensive territories to her emrnpire, she had increased, in
proportion, the burdens or' her subjects, having added-three
hundred and twenty millions of dollars to the amount of
her debt.  To find the means of defraying the annual
charges of this debt, and her other increased expenditures,
was the first and difficult task of her legislators.
2. Regard for their own interest and popularity impelled
them to avoid, if possible, imposing the whole burden upon
themselves and their fellow subjects at home; and their
thoughts were turned to the colonies, as the source whence
alleviation and assistance might be derived. On their
acootunlt, it was alleged, the contest had been wVaged; they
woluld share the advantages of its gloriou, termination,
and justice required that they should also defray a portion
of the expenses.
3. T' adopt this expedient, thle British ministry yweIe
126the more naturally led by the opinion which all the Europeai, governments entertained of the relation between the
mother country and her colonies. They were supposed
to be dependent on her will; their inhabitants a distinct
and subordinate class of subjects, and their interests entirely subservient to her aggrandizement and prosperity.
4. Acting upon these principles, Great Britain had, by
her laws of trade and navigation, confined the commerce
&lt;of the colonies almost wholly to herself. To encourage
her own artizans, she had even, in some cases, prohibited
the establishment of manufactories in America. These
yestrictions, while they increased her revenue and wealth,
greatly diminished the profits of the trade of the colonies,
and sensibly impeded their internal prosperity. They were, iost injurious to New-England, where the sterility of the
tail repelled the people from the pursuits of agriculture;
t tere they were most frequently violated, and there the
brbitrary mnode of enforcing them, by writs of assistance,
wakened the attention of a proud and jealous people to
t ieir natural rights, to their rights as English subjects,
bad to the rights granted and secured by their charters.
5. In the beginning of the year 1764, the British pariament enacted a law imposing duties upon certain articles
of merchandise, to be paid in the colonial ports. Mr.
Grenville, the prime minister, also proposed a resolution,
" that it would be proper to charge certain stamp duties
t.n thile colonies," but postponed the consideration of that
subject to a future session. As it was foreseen that the
law would be disregarded, if extraordinary measures were
not adopted to enforce- it, provision was made that all
penalties for violations of it, and of all other revenue
laws, might be recovered in the admiralty courts. The
judges of these courts were dependent solely on the king,
and decided the causes brought before them, without the
i)itervention of a jury.
6. Intelligence of these proceedings occasioned, in
America, great and universal alarm. They were considered the commencement of a systemn of taxation,
M hich, if not vigorously resisted, would, in time, be
extended to every article of commerce, and to every internal source of income; and if the colonists could be
deprived in one class of causes, why not in. all, of that
inestimable privilege, the trial by jury't  
7. The general court of Massachusetts, at their session
in June, took this law into consideration. lThe house of
IREVOLUTION. -
127!764.1-28               REVOLUTION.                   [1764.
representatives sent a spirited letter of instructions to
their agent, in England, in which they denied the right of
parliament to impose duties anid taxes upon the people not
represented in the house of commons; and directed him
to remonstrate against the duties imposed, and the stanmp
act in contemplation. They also acquainted the other
colonies with the instructions they had given to their agent,
and desired their concurrence in the-mode of opposition
adopted. In the course of the year, several other colonies, particularly New-York and Virginria, remonstrated
in respectful, but decided terms, against the proceedings
of parliament.
8. In these several state papers, the right of Great
Britain to collect a tax in the colonies, was explicitly
denied; and the denial was supported by clear and powerful arguments. It was stated that the first emigrants
came to America with the undoubted consent of the
mother country; that all the expenses of removal, of
purchasing the territory, and, for a long time, of protection
from savage warfare, were defrayed by private individuals,
except in the single instance of the settlement of Georgia:
that charters, under the great seal, were given to the
emigrants, imparting and securing to them and to their
descendants, all the rights of natural born English subjects; that of these rights, none was more indisputable,
and none more highly valued, than that no subject could
he deprived of his property but by his own consent, expressed in person or by his representative; that taxes
were but grants, by the representative, of a portion of his
own property, and of that of those who had authorized
him to act in their behalf. Could it be just, it was asked,
that the representatives of Englishmen should" give and
grant" the property of Americans? With what safety to
the colonies, could the right of taxing them be confided to
a body of men three thousand miles distant, over whom
thley had no control, none of whom could be acquainted
with their situation or resources, and whose interests
would impel them to make the burdens of the colonists
heavy, that their own mnight be light  
9. But, hesides infringing the rights of freemen, the
measure was neither equitable nor generous. The colonies had domestic governments'which they alone supported; in the late war, their exertions had been greater,
in proportion to their ability, than those of England; they
also had contracted debts which they must themselves1765.]            REVOLUTION.                      129
pay; the taxes laid by many of the assemblies, were
higher than those paid by the inhabitants of En-gland; if
the war hlad been waged on their account, it Was because,
as colonies, they were beneficial to the mothler country;
and from its happy termination, they derived no advantage
wvvhich was not the source of ultimate profit to her.
10. UJpon men who entertained the strictest notions of
colonial dependence, and parliamentary supremacy, these
arguments had little effect. The minister was not diverted
from his purpose. In March, 1765, he laid before parliament a bill, imposing stamp duties on certain papers and
documents used in the colonies. At the first reading, it
was warmly opposed; by some because it was impolitic,
by two only because it was a violation of right.
11. The bill was supported by Charles T'ownshend, a
brilliant orator, on the side of the ministry. At the con-,'lusion of an animated speech, he demanded: "And these
kmericans, children planted( by our care, nourished by our
indulgence, protected( by outr arms, uniitil they are grown to
a good degree of strength and opulence, will they grudge
to contribute their mite to relieve us from the heavy load
of national expense which we lie under 1"
12. Colonel Barre, immediately rising, indignantly and
-loquently exclaimed: "Children planted by your care!
No. Your oppressions planted them in America. They
fled from your tyranny into a then uncultivated land,
whiere they were exposed to all the hardships to which
human nature is liable; and amnong others, to the cruielties
)f a savage foe, the most subtle, and I will take upon
me to say, the most terrible, that ever inhabited any part
of God's earth. And yet, actuated by principles of true
English liberty, they met all these hardships with pleasure,
when they compared them with those they suffered in
their owncountry, fromn men who should have been their
friends.
13. "They notrished by your indulgence! No. They
grew by your neglect. When you began to care about
thlem, that care was exercised in sending persons to rule
over them, who were the deputies of some deputy sent to
spy out their liberty, to misrep(esent their actions, and to
rey upon them; whose behavior, on many occasions.

luantity of tobacco, the Indian custom of smoking it was
adopted by Raleigh, a man of gaiety and fashion, and introduced at court.
28. Soon after Drake departed, Grenviile again arxived
with provisions for the settlement. Finding it abandoned,
he left fifteen men to keep possession of the country. Ia
1587, three other ships were sent to the same place, but
the men who had been left could not be found, having pro-.
bably been murdered by the savages. After remaining a
few weeks on the coast, the ships returned to England,
leaving one hundred and seventeen men on the island.
War then existing between England and Spain, two years
elapsed before the coast was again visited. In that period
the whole number perished; but in what manner has nevet
been ascertained. Thus ended the exertions of Raleigh
to plant a colony in America.
29. These successive misfortunes withdrew, for several
years, the attention of the English from these distant regions. In 1602, Bartholomew Gosnold made a voyage to
America. Instead of taking the circuitous, but usual route,
by the'West Inidia islands, he steered directly west fromrn
England, shortening the voyage at least one third, and arrived, in May, on the coast of Massachusetts. He discovered a headland, and taking a great quantity of codfish
near it, called it Cape Cod. Proceeding southwardly, he
passed Gay Head, entered Buzzard's bay, and uron an
island within it erected a small fort, the ruins of which
were visible so late as 1797. After trading a while with
the Indians he returned home.
30. The report made by Gosnold revived the spirit of
adventure. In 1603 and 1605, two voyages were made
in the same direction, and Penobscot bay, Massachusetts
bay, and the rivers between them were discovered. The
accounts given by the last navigators confirmed the report
of Gosnold, and led to a more extensive scheme of coloni
zation than had yet been attempted.
31. Of this scherme, Mr. Richard Hakluyt was the most
active promoter. By his persuasion an association of gentlemen, in different parts of the kingdom, was formed for
thle purpose of sending colonies to America. Upon their
application to kirg James, he, by letters patent, dated in
1606, divided the country of Virginia, then considered as
extending from the southern boundary of North Carolina to
the northern boundary of Maine, into two districts, and constituited two companies for planting colonies within them.
1314. " They protected by your arms! They have nobly
taken up arms in your defence. They have exerted their
valor, amidst their constant and laborious industry, for
the defence of a country which, while its frontier was
drenched in blood, has yielded all its little savings to your
emolument. Believe me, and remember I this day told
you so, the same spirit which actuated that people at first,
still continues with them; but prudence forbids me to
explain myself farther.
15. "God knows I do not at this time speak from party
heat. However superior to me in general knowledge and
experience, any one here may b1e, I claim to know more
of America, having been conversant in that country. The
people there are as truly loyal as any subjects the king
has; but they are a people jealous of their liberties, and
will vindicate them if they should be violated. But the
subject is delicate.; I will say no more."
16. Eloqence and argument availed nothing. The bill
was almost unanimously passed. The night atter, Doctor
Franklin, then in England as agent for Penn,tsylvania,
wrote to Charles Thompson: "The sun of libe ty is set;
you must light up the candles of industry and economy."
"Be assured," said Mr. Thompson, in reply. "that we
shall light up torches of qcluite another sort;" tthus predict-'
ing the commotions which followed.
17. The act provided that all contracts and legal processes should be written on stamped paper, which was to
be furnished, at exorbitant prices, by the government or
should have no force in law. Information of its passage
was received in all the colonies with sorrow and dismay.
They saw that they must either surrender, without a
struggle, their darling rights, or resist the government of
a nation, which they had been accustomed to regard with
filial respect, and was then the most powerful in the world.
18. The general assembly of Virginia were in session
when the information arrived. Of that body, Patrick
Henry, a young man, but a distinguished orator, was a
member. Near the close of the session, he proposed five
resolutions, in the first four of which were asserted the
various rights and privileges claimed by the colonists, and,
in the fifth, the right of parliament to tax America, was
boldy and explicitly denied. These he defended by strong
reason and irresistible eloquence, and they were adopted
by a majority of one.
19. The next -day, in his absence, the fifth resolution

was rescinded; but that and the others had gone forth to
the world, and imparted higher animation to the:friends of
freedom. They were a signal to the resolute and ardent;
they gave encouragement to the timid and cautious: they
were industriously but privately ci culated, in the principal
cities, until they arrived in New- England, where they
were fearlessly published in all tile newspapers.
20. Nearly at the samne time, and before the proceedings of Virginia were known in Massachusetts, her general
ceourt adopted measures to procure a combined opposition
to the offensive laws. They passed a resolve proposing
that a congress of delegates from the several colonies,
should be held at New-York, and addressed letters to the
other assemblies, earnestly soliciting their conacurrence.
21. These legislative proceedings took place in May
and June, 1765. They were the mnoderate and dignified
expression of feelings, which animated, in a more intense
degree, a great majority of the people. In New-England,
associt.ions, for the purpose of resistina the law, were
organized, assluming, from 13arre's s ee.l, the appellation,. " Sons of Liberty;" pamiphlets were published vindicating thie rights of the colonies; and the public journals
were filled with essays pointing out the langer which
threatened the cause of lilberty, and encouraging a bold
and manly resistance.
22. Excited by these publications, a multitude assembled
in Boston, on the 14th of August, burned tlhe effigy of
Andrew Oliver, who had been appointed stamp-distributer,
and demnolished a building which they supposed he had
erected for his office.  Fearful of farther injury, Mr.
Oliver declared his intention to resign, when tihe people
desisted from molesting him.
23. Several days afterwards, a mob beset the house of
Mr. Story, an officer of the detested admiralty court.
They broke his windows, destroyed his furititure, and
burned his papers. They then proceeded to the house of
lieutenant-governor Hutchlinson, by whose advice, it was
supposed, the stamp-act had been passed. TI'hey entered
it by force. Himself, his wife, and children fled. His
elegant fuirniture was carried off or destroyed. The partitions of the house were broken down, and the next
morning nothing but the bare and desolate walls remained.
24. When intelligence of these proceedings reached
Newport, in Rhode Island, the people of that place assembled amid committed simnilar outrages. Two houses

131were pillaged, and the stamp-distributer, to preserve his
own, was obliged to give to the leader of the exasperated
populace a written resignation of his office. In Connecticut, similar commotions were also quietedby the resignation of the distributer of stamps for that colony.
25. In New-York, the people displayed equal spirit,
but less turbulence and rage. The obnoxious act was
printed, under the title of "The folly of England, and
the ruin of America," and thus exhibited for sale in the
streets. At an early period, the stamp-distributer prudently resigned his office; and when the stamped paper
arrived, it was deposited for safe keeping in the fort. A
mob required the lieutenant-governor to place it in their
hands.  He refused; but, terrified by their menaces,
consented to deliver it to the magistrates, who deposited
it in the city hall. Ten boxes, which afterwards arrived,
were seized by the people, and committed to the flames.
-26. So general was the opposition to the law, that the
stamp-officers, in all the colories, were compelled to
resign. In Boston, care was taken, on the one hand, to
prevent the recurrence of violent proceedings, and, on the
other, to keep in till vigor the spirit of resistance. A
newspaper wx.v established, having for its device a snake
divided into as many parts as there were colonies, and
for its motto, "join or die.,r. Oliverwas required to
resign his ofice, with more derernony and solenmiity, undler
a iarge elm, which had, from the meetings hleld undler it,
received the name of the tree of, liberty.
27. In October, the congress recommnended by Massachusetts, convened at New-York. Delegates from six
provinces only were preseint  Their first act was a Declaration of Righlts, in which they asserted, that the
colonies were entitled to all the rights and liberties of
natural born subjects within the kingdom of Great Britain,
the most essential of which were the exclusive right to
tax themselves, and the privilege of trial by jury. A
petition to the king, and a memorial to both houses of
parliament, were also agreed on; and the colonial assemblies were advised to appoint special agents to solicit, in
concert, a redress of grievances. To interest the people
of England in the cause of the colonies, the merchants of
New-York directedtheir correspondents, in that country,
to purchase no more goods until the stamp-act should be
repealed. Immtnediately after, non-importation agreements
were adopted in the other colonies, and associations were

[1G65,
132organized for the encouragement of domestic manufactures. To avoid the nfiecessiby of stamps, proceedings in
the courts of justice were suspended, and disputes were
settled by arbitration.
28. In the meantime, an entire change had taken place
in the British Cabinet, and a proposition to repeal the
stamp act was, by the new ministry, laid before parliament.
An interesting debate ensued. Mr. Grenville, the late
prime minister, declared, that to repeal the act under
existing circumstances, would degrade the government,
and encourage rebellion. "When," he demanded, "were
the Americans emancipated   By what law, by whlat
reason, do they ungratefully claim exemption from defraying expenses incurred in protecting them!"
29. William Pitt, he who hal wielded, with such
mighty effect, the power of England, in the late war, rose
to reply. He regretted that he had not been able to attend
in his place, and oppose the law on its passage. " It is
now an act that has passed. I would speak with decency
of every act of this house; but I must beg the indulgence
of this house to speak of it with freedom. Assuredly a
more important subject never engaged your attention; that
subject only excepted, when, nearly a century ago, it was
the question whether you yourselves were bond or free.
30. "Those who have spoken before me, with so mniuch
vehemence, would maintain the act because our honor
demands it. But can the point of honor stand opposed
against justice, agailnst reason, against right. It is my
opinion that England has no right to tax the colonies.
At the same time, I assert the authority of this kingdom
over the colonies to be sovereign and supreme, in every
circumstance of government and legislation whatsoever.
31. " Taxation is no part of the governing or legislative power. The taxes are a voluntary gift and grant of
the commons alone; when, therefore, in this house, we
give and grant, we give and grant what is our own. But
in an American tax, what do we do-. We, your majesty's cormmons of Great Britain, give aiid grant to your
majesty-what. Our own property! No. We give and
grant to your majesty the property of your commons in
America. It is an absurdity in terms.
32. "It has been asked, when were the Americans
emancipated l But I desire to klinow wheni they were
made slaves. I hear it said, that America is obstinate;
America is almost in open rebellion.  I rejoice that
I 3

REVOLUTION.
133America has resisted. Three millions of people, so dead
to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to siubmit to be
slaves, would have been fit instrumei-ts to make slaves
of ourselves.
33. "The honorable member has said, for he is fluent
in words of bitterness, that America is ungrateful. He
boasts of his bounties towards her. But are not these
bounties intended finally for the benefit of this kingdom.
The profits of Great Britain, from her commnerce with
the colonies, are two millions a year. This is the fihnd
that carried you triuimphantly through the last war. The
estates that were rented at two thousand pounds a year,
seventy-years ago, are at three thousand pounds at present. You owe this to America. This is the price she
pays you for protection.
34. "A great deal has been said without doors, and
more than is discreet, of the power, of the strength of
America. In a good cause, on a sound bottonm, the force
of this country can crush America to atoms. But on the
ground of this tax, when it is wished to prosecute an
evident injustice, I am one who will lift my hands and
my voice against it. In such a cause, your success
would be deplorable and victory hazardous. Arrierica,
if she fell, would fall like the strongc man. She would
embrace the pillars of the state, and pull down the constitution along with her."
35. The sentiments of this great statesman prevailed
in parliament. The stamp act was repealed; but another
act was passed declaring that " the legislature of Great
Britain has authority to make laws to bind the colonees
in all cases whatsoever."  The merchants of London reioiced at this repeal. They had felt the effects of the
colonial non-importation agreements, and dreaded that
still more injurious consequLences would follow.
36. But far greater were the rejoicings of the Americans. They had obtained the object for which they hadl
contended.  They regarded the d3claratory act as the
miere reservation of wounded pride, and welcomed with
transport the opporttunity of again cherishing their former
affection for the land of their fathers. The assemblies of
several colonies voted their thanks to Mr. Pitt, and to
others in England, who had supported their cause; and
that of Virginia resolved to erect an obelisk to their
honor, and a marble statue of the king, as a memorial of
gratitude.
REVOLUTION.:134
L!766.37 By the people of New-England and New-York less,oy was felt and less gratitude displayed. The laws imposing duties on their trade were still in force.  The
courts of admiralty, sitting withouLt juries, still retained
jurisdiction of all revenue causes.  Their repeated
contests with their governors, had weakened their attachment to the nation that appointed them, and confirmed
their republican principles. They still remembered the
past and entertained( suspicions of the future.
38. The very next year events occurred which justified
these suspi'ionis. A law of parliament, which remnained
unrepealed, directed that whenever troops should be
marched into any of the colonlies, quarters, rum, and variouls necessary articles, should be provided for them, at
thle expense of the colony. The assemnbly of New-York
refiused obedienrce to this law, considering in an indirect
tmode of taxing them without their consent. To punish
this disobedience, parliament immediately suspended the
authority of the assembly. It was easily seen that nothing had been gained, if this power of suspension, for such
a cause, existed, and could be exercised at pleasure.
39. The alarm, occasioned by this act of despotic
power, was increased by a-measure, which, under the
ausl)ices of a new ministry, was adopted in June, 1767.
A duty was imp)osed by parliament on the importation
into the colonies, of glass, tea, and other enumerated
articles, and provision was made for the appointment of
commissioners of the customs to be dependent solely on
the crown.
40. Early in the next year, the general court of Massachusetts, pursuing the same course as in 1764, addressed
a letter to their agent in London, containing able arguments
against those duties, and requested him to communicate the
letter to the ministry. They also sent to the other colonlial
assemblies, a circular letter, in which these arguments
were repeated, and suggested the expediency of acting in
concert, in all endeavors to obtain redress.
41. Thiese proceedings incensed and alarmed the ministry. They feared that a union of the-colonies would
give them strengfth and confidence, and determined if possible to prevent it. They instructed Sir.John Bernard,
then governor of Massachusetts, to require the general
court to rescind the vote directing the circular letter to be
sent, and in case of refusal to dissolve it. The governor
I.4

REVOLtJTION.
135communicated these instructions to the house of representatives, which, by a vote of ninety-two to seventeen, refused to rescind. and was accordingly dissolved.
42. The attemipt to intimidate did but strengthen opposition. The non-importation agreemnents, which had been
lately abandoned, were renewed, and more extensively
adopted. The citizens of Boston met, and proposed that
a convention of delegates from the several towns in the
province, should be held at that place. Nearly every
town accordingly sent delegates. This convention, though
it disclaimed all legal authority, was regarded witlh the
same respect as a legitimate assembly. Its proceedings
were unimportant, but by its sessions in the metropolis of
New-England, the people becamne accustomed to pay da.
erence to a body of men deriving all their authority from
the instructions of their constituents.
43. On so many occasions had the refractory spirit of
the citizens of Boston been displayed, that general Gage,
who was commander-in-chie'f of all th6 troops in the colonies, was ordered to station a regiment in that town, as
wel to overawe the citizelns, as to protect the officers of
the revenue in the discharge of their duty. Before the
order was executed, the seizure of a sloop belonging to
Mr.Hancock, a popular leadei-, occasioned a riot, in which
those officers were insulted and beaten. T''he general,
on receiving information of this event, sent two regiments
instead of one, and on thte first of October they arrived in
the harbour.
44. The ships.that brought them, talcing a station
that commanded the whole town, lay with their broadsides towards it, ready to fire should resistance be attempted. The troops, with loaded mnusklets and fixed
bayonets, then landed; and, the selectmen having reftised
to provide quarters, they took possession of the statehouse. All the rooms, except one reserved for the council, were filled, and two peices of cannon were placed near
the principal entrance.  
45. With indignant and exasperated feelings, the people
witnessed this threatening display of military force. They
saw the hall of their venerated legialature polluted by the
tread of foreign mercenaries. Thliwy saw soldiers parading
theix streets and guards rnmounted at the corners. T'hey
were challenged as they passed, and the unwelcome din
of martial music often disturbed their reposes The
REVOLUTION
[1768knew that intimidation was the object, and felt a stronger
determination to resist than had before animated their
hosoms.
46. Resolutions, in the mean time, had been adopted in
parliament, censuring, in the strongest terms the conduct
of the people of Massachusetts, and directing the gover
nor to make strict in,quiry, as to all treasons committed in
that province, since the year 1667, in order that the persons most active in committing them might be sent to
England for trial.
47. These resolutions rendered it sufficiently evident
that Great Britain had determined to adhere to the system,,f measures she had adopted. In May, they were taken
i ito con sidexration by the house of burgesses of Virginia.
lI sundry resolutions, they reasserted the right of the
X olonies to be exempted from parliamentary taxation, and
Aeclared that seizing persons in the colonies, suspected of
k,aving committed crimes thlerein, and sending them beond sea to be tried, violated the rights of British subjects,
"s it deprived theml of the inestimable right of being tried
),y a jury of the vicinage, and of producing witnesses on
heir trial.
48. While these resolutions were under discussion, the
louse, apprehensive of an immediate dissolution should
the subject of their deliberations be known to the governor, closed their doors, The instant they were opened, a
message was announced, requesting their attendance before him. "Mr. Speaker," said he, " and gentlemen of
the house of burgesses. I have heard of your resolves,
and augur ill of their effects. You have made it my duty
to dissolve you, and you are dissolved accordingly."
49. This, like every previous measure of intimidation,
excited to a still highler degree, the spirit of opposition.'The members assembled at a private house, elected their
speaker to preside as moderator. and unanimously formed
Inon-importation agreement similar to those previously
idw,pted at the north. In a few weekls, the example ot
Virgiiia was followed by most of the southern colonies.
50. To the citizens of Boston, the troops quarterec
among thenl  were a painful and irritating spectacle.
Quarrels occurring daily between them and the populace,
increased the animosity of each to ungovernable hatred.
At length, on the evening of the fifth of March, an affray
tookl pace in King-street, since called State-stree.,] iu

17,69.~which a detachment of the troops commanded by captain
Preston, after being insulted, pelted with snow-,balls and
dared to fire, discharged their muskets upon the multitude,
killing tour persons and wounding others.
51. The drums were instanrtly beat to arms, and several
thousand people assembled, who, enraged by the sight of
the dead bodies of their fellow citizens, slain in a cause
dear to theni, all, prepared to attack a larger detachment
which had been sent to support their comrades. In this
state of excitement, they were addressed by lieutenantgovernor Hutchinson, who appeared in the midst of them.
lThough personally obnoxious, he calmed their iury, and
prevailed upon them to disperse until morning.
52. The next day, captain Preston and his p,rty were
arrested and committed to prison. The cit'-Lcr.s met and
appointed a committee to demand the im-ed'.ate removal
of the troops from the town. At this iileeting Samuel
Adams, an inflexible patriot, was distinrguished for his
decision and bolness. After some hesication, on the part
of the commanding officer, they were sent to castle William, and were accompanied by several officers of the
customs who dreaded the indlignation of the people.
53. Three days afterwards, the funeral of the deceased
took place. It was conducted with great pomp, and unusual
ceremnonies, expressive of the public feeling. The shops
were closed. The bells of Boston, Roxbury, and Charlestown were tolled. Four processions, moving from different
parts of the town, met at the fatal spot, and proceeded
thence towards the place of interment. This iunited procession comprised an immense number of people on foot
and in carriages, all displaying the deepest grief and indignation. The bodies were deposited together in the same
vault.
54. When the passions of the people had in some degree
subsided, captain Preston and his soldiers were brought to
trial. They were defended by John Adams, and Josiah
Quincy, two able lawyers, and distinguished leaders of
the popular party. For nearly six weeks, the court were
employed in examining witnesses, and in listeninrg to the
argumrents of counsel.  Captain Proston, not having
ordered his men to fire, was acquitted -by the jury. Of
the soldiers, six were also acquitted, I here beiig no positive
testimony that they fired upon the people; and two were
acquitted of murder, as great provocation was offered, but

found guilty ofmanslaughlter-a result evincing the integrity of the jury and the magnanimity and uprightness of
the counsel for the accused.
55. While these events were occurring in the colonie.,
an attempt, supported by the prime minister, was made in
England, to repeal all the laws for raising a revenue in
America. The parliament, with a mixture of timidity and
obstinacy, characteristic of the councils of the nation at
that period, relinquished all the duties but that on tea, and
this they unwisely retained to assert and display their
supremacy over the colonies.
56. This partial repeal pr)duced no chanrge in the sentiments of the people.  By rendering the contest more
clearly a contest of principle, it sanctified their conduct in
their own view, and ennobled it in that of the world.
The non-importation agreements, however, were made to
correspond with the altered law. Tea only  -s to be
excluded from the country; and this article of luxury was
banished from the tables of all who were friendly toAme
rican rights.
CHAPTER XVI.
REVOLUTION.
THi, years 1771 and 1772 were not distinguished by any
tmportant event. The southern colonies, more agricultural
than commercial, suffered but little from the operation of
the laws of trade, and, having mostly popular governors,
continued tranquil. Ill Massachusetts, various causes
contributed to increase the discontent which previously
existed.  Governor Hutchinson, having adjourned the
general court to Salem, refused, notwithstanding reiterated
remonstrances, to permit them to return to Boston. He
withdrew the provincial troops from thie castle and supplied their place with regulars, as the British troops were
then called. He declined receiving his salary from the
colonial treasury, stating that his majesty had assigned to
him, and also to the judges, permanent and honorable
salaries, to be paid in Great Britain. These measures
were highly unpopular, and especially the last which re-'eased those officers from all dependence on the people.
2. To ascertain the sentiments of the inhabitants; toINTRODUCTION.
32. The southern district he granted to Sir Thomas
Gates and his associates, chiefly resident in London, and
thlerefore styled the London Company. The northern
district he granted to Thomas Hanharn and his associates,
who were styled the Plymouth Company. The two districts were styled South and North Virginia. The members of these companies were principally mnerchants; their
objects were the extension of commerce and the discovery
of mines of the precious metals, which were supposed to
abound in North as well as in South America.
33. For the supreme government of the colonies, a grand
counlcil was instituted, the members of which were to reside ill England, and to be appointed by the king. The
subordinate jurisdiction was committed to a council in each
colony, the members of which were to be appointed by the
grand council in England, and to be governed by its
instructions. To the emigrants and their descendants
were secured the enjoyment of all the rights of denizens
or citizens, in the same manner and to the same extent as
if they had remained or been born, in England.
34. Before the date, however, of these letters patent,
the king of France granted to the Sieur De Monts all the
territory from the 40th to the 46th degree of north latitude,
or from New-Jersey to Nova Scotia, then called Acadia.
By virtue of this grant a settlement was made in 1604, on
the south eastern side of the bay of Fundy, and called Porl
Royal. In 1608, Samuel Chanmplain, the agent of D_
Molts, laid the foundation of Quebec, the capital of Ca.
nada. From these possessions of the French, the colo..
nies of New England and New-York were, for more tlhas
a century, frequently and cruelly annoyed.
14140           REVOLIJTION.[73
enlighten the remotest parts of the province by diffusing
intelligence, and distributing political essays; and to produce concert in measures, James Warren and Samuel
Adams suggested and procured the appointment, in every
town, of comnmittees of correspondence. By the agency
of these, resolutions and addresses, sometimnes inflammatory and always spirited, were speedily conveyed through
the country, arousing the attention of all and exhorting to
perseverance in the cause of liberty. TI'his example was
soon after followed in other colonies; and in 1773, at the
suggestion of the Virginia assembly, standing committees
were appointed, by the colonial legislatures, to correspond
with each other. This institution, when mnore active
opposition became necessary, was found extremely useful.
3. In this year, Dr. Franklin obtained in London a
number of original letters from governor Hutchinson,
lieutenu *governor Oliver and others, to their correspondents in parliament. In these letters, the opposition in
MAlassachusetts was stated to be confined to a few factious
individuals, who had been emboldened by the weakness of
the means used to restrain them. Measures more vigorous
were recommended: and the ministry were urged to take
from the people and exercise themselves the power of
appointing counsellors and all colonial magistrates. Tilese
letters he transmitted to Boston.
4. The source and occasion of the offensive proceedings
of parliament were now disclosed. The passions of the
people were highly inflamed, and the weight of popular
indignation fell upon the authors of these letters. The
central committee of correspondence, at Boston, sent
printed copies, enclosed in a spirited circular, to all the
towns in the province. And the general court, in severat
resolutions which were also published, animadverted with
severity upon the misrepresentations and advice contained
in the letters, thus increasing the irritation which their
discovery and perusal had occasioned.
S. Meanwhile the tea of the East India Company, not
finding a marklet in America, accumulated in their warehouses in Englanld. Encouraged bythe government, they
resolved to export it on their owni account, and appointed
consignees in the various sea-ports in thle colonies. Those
in Philadelphia were induced, by the disapprobation expressed by the citizens, to decline their appointment. In
New-York, spirited handbills were circulated menacing
with ruin every person who should be concerned in vending
140
REVOLUTION.
[1773tea, and requiring the pilots, at their peril, not to conduct
ships, loaded with that article, into the harbor. Intimidated
by these proceedings, the captainis of the tea ships, bound
to those ports, returned with their cargoes to England.
6. In Boston, inflammatory handbills were also circulated, and meetings held; but the consignees, being mostly
relatives of the governor, and relying on his support, refused
to decline their appointments. Their refusal enraged the
citizens, and the community became agitated by the operation of highly excited passions. Meetings were more
frequently held. The conmmittees of correspondence were
every where active. The people of the country exhorted
their brethren in Boston to act worthy of their former
character, worthy of" Sons of Liberty," upon whose conduct, in the present emergency, every thing depended.
7. On the 29th of November, a ship, laden with tea,
came into the harbor. Notifications were immediately
posted up, inviting every friend to his country to meet
forthwith and concert united resistance to the arbitrary
measures of Britain. A crowded mneeting was held, and
a resolution adopted, "that the tea should not be landed,
that no duty should be paid, and that it should be sent
back in the same vessel." A watch was also organized
to prevent it from being secretly brought on shore.
8. A short time was then allowed for the captain to
prepare to return home with his cargo. Governor Hutchinson refused to grant him the requisite permission to
pass the castle. Other vessels, laden with tea, arrived.
The agitation increased, and on the 18th of December, the
inhabitants of Boston and the adjoining towns assenibled
to determine what course should be pursued. At this
important meeting, Josiah Quincy, desirous that the consequences of the measures to be adopted should be first
seriously contemplated, thus addressed his fellow citizens
9. "It is not, Mr. Moderator, the spirit that vapours
within these walls that will sustain us in the hour of need.
The proceedings of this day will call forth evenets which
will make a very different spirit necessary for our salvation.
Whoever supposes that shlouts and hosannas will terminate our trials, entertains a childish fancy. We must be
grossly ignorant of the value of the prize for which we
contend; we must be equally ignorant of the power of
those who have combined against us; we must be blind
to that inveterate malice and insatiable revenge which
a-tuate our enemies, abroad and in our bosom, to hope that
REVOLUTION.
141we shall end this controversy without the sharpest conflicts
-or to flatter ourselves that popular resolves, popular
harangues, and popular acclamations, will vanquish our
foes. Let us consider the issue; let us look to the end;
let us weigh and deliberate, before we advance to those
mneasures which mu-st bring on the most trying and terrible
strutggle this country ever saw."
10. In the evening the question was put, " Do you abide
by your former resolution to prevent the landing of the tea?"
The vote was unanimouis in the affirmative. Anplication
was again made to the governor for a pass. Af --r a short
delay, hlis refusal was coinmunicated to the assemrnbly.
Instaitly a person, disguised like an Indian, gave the war
whoop from the gallery. At this signal, the people rushed
out of the house and hastened to the wharves. About
twency persons, in the dress of Mohawklis, boarded the
vessels, and, protected by the crowd on shlore, broke open
thiree hundred and forty-two chests of tea and emptied
their contents into the ocean. Their purpose accomnplished,
the multitude returned without tumult to their habitations.
11. TI'hese proceedings excited the anger of parliament
and the displeasure of the British nationi. Punishment,
not a clhange of mneasures, was resolved upon. An act,
closing the port of Boston, and removing the custom-house
to Salem, was passed, and was to continllue in fbrce until
compensation should be made for the tea destroyed; anrother act was l)assed, takling from the general court and
giving to the crown the appointment of counsellors; and
general Gage was made governor in' the place of Mr.
Ii utchinson.
12. Intelligence of the Boston port-bill occasioned a
meeting of the citizens of the town; they were sensible
that "the most trying and terrible struggle" was indeed
now approaching, but felt unawed by its terrors. T'hey
sought not to shelter themselves from the storm by submission, but became more resolute as it increased. They
declared the act to be unjust and inhuman, and invitedi
their brethren in the other colonies to unite with them in
a general non-imnportation agreement.
13. A similar spirit pervaded and animated the whole
country. Addresses from the adjacent towns, and from
every part of the continent, were sent to the citizens of
Boston, applauding their resolution, exhorting them to
perseverance, and assuring them that they were considered
as suffering in a common cause. In Virginia, the first day

[1774.1774.]             REVOLUTION.                      143
of June, when the law'began to operate, was observed as a
public and solemn fast. With devout feelings, the divine
interposition was implored, in all the churches, to avert the
evils of civil war, and to give to the people one heart and
one mnind, firmly to oppose every invasion of their li)erty.
14. The same day was observed, with similar solemnity,
in most of the other cololies; and thus an opportunity
was presented to the ministers of the gospel to dispense
political instruction, to paint, in vivid colors, the sufferings
of the citizens of Boston, and to warn their congregations,
that, should Great Britain succeed in her schemes, the
danger to their religious would be as great as to their civil
privileges; that a tame submission to the will of p)arliasme'nt, would inevitably be followed by bishops, tithes, test
acts, and ecclesiastical tribunals.
15. The sufferings of the inhabitants of Boston were
indeed severe.  Nearly all were compelled to be idle.
Many, by loss of employment, lost their sole means of
support. In this extremity, contributions in money and
provisions were forwarded to them from all the colonies,
as proofs of sympathy in their distresses, and of approbationI of their having met and manfully withstood the firet
shock of arbitrary power.
16. Gradually and constantly had the minds and feelinrgs
of the Americanis been preparing for this important crisis.
That enthusiastic patriotism whichl elevates the soul above
all considerations of interest or danger had now become
their ruling passion. The inh'abitants of Salem spurned
advantages to be derived from the punishment inflicted on
a sister town, for its zeal in a sacred and common cause.
"We must," said they, in a remonstrance to the governor,
"be dead to every idea of justice, lost to all feelings of
humanity; could we indulge one thought, to seize on
wealth,-and raise our fortunes from the ruin of our suffering neighbours."
17. In June, the general court assembled at Salem, and
among their first.acts were, the recommendation of a
continental congress, which had been suggested by the
committee of correspondence in Virginia, and the choice
of delegates to attend it. While engaged, with closed
doors, in this business, governor Gage, who had received
a private intimation of their purposes, dissolved the coart
by a proclamation which was read upon the steps. In
all the other colonies, except Georgia, delegates were also
-chosen.18. On the 5th of September, these delegates met at
Philadelphia. Peyton Randolph of Vir_inia, was unanimously elected president, and Charles'Thompson, secretary. It was detertnined that each colony should have but
one vote, whatever mnight be the number of its deputies,
and that all their transactions, except such as they miigilt
resolve to ptblish, should be kept inviolably secret.
19. Resolutions were then adopted, expressing the
sympathy of congress in the sufferings of their countrymen
in Massachusetts, and highly approving the wisdoam and
fortitude of their conduct. They also,resolved that the
importation of goods from Great Britain should cease on
the first day of the succeeding D)ecermber, and all exlports
to that country on the 10th of Septemrnber, 1775, unless
American grievances should lbe sooner redressed. T'hese
resolutions possessed no legal force, but never were la.ws
more faithfully observed.
20. In other resolutions, they enumerated certain rights,
which, as mnen and English subjects, "they claimned, demanded, and insisted on;" anrid recounted inumerous violations of those rights by parliament. Addresses to the
people of Great Britain, to the inhabitants of Canada, and
to their constituents, were prepared anld published; and an
affectionate petition to the kling was agreed( upon.
21. In these able and( important state papers, the claims,
principles, and feelings of their constituents are clearly
and eloquenetly set forthi. They glow with the lo-e of
liberty, they display a determinatlion, too firmn to be shaklen,
to defend and preserve it at every hazard; they contain
the strongest professions of attachment to the mother
country, antd of loyalty to the king. A desire of independence is expressly disavowed. "Place us," says the
congress, " in the situation we were in, at the close of
the last war, and our former harmony will be restored."
"We ask," say they in their petition, " but for peace,
liberty, and safety. We wish not a diminution of the
prerogative, nor do we splicit the grant of any new right
in our favor. Your royal authority over us, and our connection withl Great Britain, we shall always carefully and
zealously endeavour to support and maintain."
22. These papers, going fi)rth to the world, made the
cause of the colonies known throuThout Europe, and conciliated those who had embraced liberal principles in
politics. or felt displeasure at the pride and haughtiness of
Britain. Their tone of rna1ly energy, and the knowledge
RIEVOLUTION.
[174.
144they displayed of political science, excited universal applause and admiration.
23. "When your lo-rdships," said Mr. Pitt, in the
British senate, "have peruse(d the papers transmitted to
us fromn-America; when you coniisider the dignity, the
firmness, and the wisdom, with which the Americans
have acted, you cannot but respect their cause. History,
my lords, has been my favorite study; and in the celebrated writings of antiquity I have often admired the
patriotism of Greece and Rome; but, my lor(s, I must
declare and avow, that in the master states of the world,
1 know not the people nor the senate, who, in such a
conlplication of difficult circumstances, can-stand in preference to the delegates of America:assembled; in general
congress, at Philadelphia. I trust that it is obviolls to
your lordshlips, that all attempts to impose servitude upon
such men, to establish despotism over such a mighty
continental nation, must be vain, must be futile."
24. In America, the proceedings-of congress were read
with enthusiasm and veneration. Their reasonings confirmeed the conviction, strongly felt by nearly the whole
people, of the perfect justice of their cause. In the address to themselves, they were admonished "to extend
their views to mrouratfl events, and to be in all respects
prepared( for every contingency."  Great effoits were
consequiently made to provide armns and all the munitions
of war. Independent companies were formed; voluntary
trainings were frequent; the old and the young, the rich
and the poor devoted, their hours of amusement and of
leisure, to exercises calculated to fit them to act a part in
the anticipated conflict. The country was aiive with the
btustle of preparation, and in every countenance could be
read the expectation of important transactions, in which
all must participate.
25. Complete unanimity, however, did not exist. Som
of the late emigrants fom Entgland, the mnost of those
who heldl offices by her appointment, many whose timidity
magn;fied her power, clung to her aithority, and as the
crisis approached, declared themselves.her adherents.
These were denominated tories; the friends of liberty,
whilgs-names by which the advocates of artbitrary power,
and the friendsof constitutional liberty, were d(istinguLhed
in England.
26. General Gage,. who had been recently appointed

145the continent, several regiments of troops, and encamped
them on tne conmmon, in Boston. He afterwards erected
fortifications on the Neck, a narrow isthmus which unites
the town with the mairr land; and on the night of the first
of September, he seized the powder deposited in the provincial arsenal at Cambridge.
27. The people, meanwhile, were not idle. They appointed delegates to a provincial contgress, which assemb'ed in the beginning of October. Mr. Hancock was
chosen president, and the delegates resolved, that, bfor the
defence of the proviice, a military force, to consist of one
fourth of the rnilitia, should be organized and stand ready
to march at a minute's warning; that money should be
raised to iurchase military stores; and they appointed a
committee of supplies, and a committee of safety, to sit
during the recess.
28. The more'.outhern provinces, particularly Penr.sylyania, Virginia, and Maryland, displayed the same love of
liberty and deterrmination to resist; provincial congresse.
were convened, comniinittees appointed, and resolutions
passed, designed and adapted to animate those who, in
Massachusetts, stood in the post of danger, and to excite
in all hearts that devotion to country which is alone
capable of sustaining a people in an arduous struggle with
a superior foe.
29. In the parliament of Great Britain, American
affairs came on to be discussed, in the beginning of the
year 1775.- Several plans of conciliation were rougtt
forward by the opposition and rejected; but one, prop(sed
by lord North, the prime minister, was adopted. The
purport of it was, that if any colony would engage to
contribute a sum satisfactory to his majesty, for the coinminon defence, the parliament would forbear to tax that
colony, so long as the contribution was punctually paid.
This plan conceded nothing. To weaken the colonies by
dividing them was so evidently the object, that all indignantly spurned the proffered terms.
30. In connection with this conciliatory proposition, as
it was called, measures of punishment and intimidation
were adopted. The northern colonies were prohibited
from fishing on the banks of Newfoundland, additiomal
res,rictions were imposed upon the trade of all of then,
and several ships of the line, and ten thousand tlioops,
were sent to Amrerica.
In the debates in parliamrnen;, tlhe friends of tha

colonies, althor gh few, were animated in their praise and
eloquent in theft defence. The adherents of the ministry
indulged in the grossest abuse and ridicule. The Americans, they said, were naturally cowards, habitually lazy,
ard constitutionally feeble; they were incapable of discipline; and a small force would be sufficient to conquer
them.   This ignorance of their character, which was
general throughout England, doubtless caused the ministry
to persist in measures which, had their information been
correct. they would never have ventured to undertake.:
32. On the evening of the 18th of April, general Gage
despatched from Boston a body of eight hundred troops, to
destroy a quantity of provisions and military stores deposited, by the committee of supplies, at Concord. Intel.
ligence of this movement was sent to Lexington and
Concord a few hours before the troops embarked. The
ringing of bells- and the firing of signal guns-brought the
minute-men together. Early the next morning, those of
I,exington assembled on the green near the meeting-house.
A few minutes afterwards, the advanced body of the regu?
lars approached within musket shot.  Majoir Pitcairn,
riding forward, exclaimed, " Disperse, you rebels, throw
(down your arms and disperse."  Not being instantly
obeyed; he discharged his pistol and ordered his men tofire. They fired and killed several. Thle militiadispersed;
but the firing continued. In the whole, eight were killed,
sonie of whom were shIot in their concealment behind the
fences.
33. The detachment proceeded to Concord. The minute,
men of that town hnd also assembled; but, being few ii
number, they retired on the approach of the regulars.
These entered the town and destroyed the provisions and
stores. The minute-men were reinforced and advanced
again towards the regulars. A skirmish ensued, in which
captain l)avis, of Acton, was killed. The British troops
were compelled to retreat, leaving behind them several
killed and wounded.
34. The whole country was now in arms; and the troops
retreated with precipitation. The militia not only pressed
upon their rear, but placed themselves sinrgly behind trees
dnl stone walls, anid, from these secure coverts, fired upon
them as they passed. At Lexington they met a reinforcement under lord: Percy, which general Gage had despatched
on receiving information of the occurrences there in the
morninrg.               K;2148  RfEVOLUTIONARY WAR.  
35. After:resting a moment, the whole body proceeded
towards Boston. In their progress they were more and
mtore harassed by the provincials, whose number hourly
increased, and who became in proportion more adventurous.
Having an intimate knowledge of all thle roads, they could
pursue with less fatigue,-and mneet the enemy unexpectedly
at the various windings; and being all experienced marksmien, their shots seldom failed of effect. At sunset, the
regulars, almost overcome with fatigue, passed along
Charlestown Neck, and found, on Bunker's Hill, a place
of security and repose.
36. In this engagement, sixty-five of the royal forces
were killed, one hundred and eighty wounded, antd twentyeight made prisoners. Of the provincials, fifty were kiilled,
thirty-four were wounded, and four were missing. The
killed were lamented and honored as the first mnartyrs in
the cause of liberty. In the variou-s sections of country
fromn which they came, hatred of Great Britain took still
deeper root; and New-England, connected niore than any
other part of the world, as one great family, by the closest
intimnacy of all the inhabitants, universally felt the deprivation with a mixed feeling of sorrow and rage.
37. Intelligence of the battle of Lexington spread rapidly
throughl Massachusetts, and the adjoining provinces. The
farmer left his plough in the furrow, the mrechanic dropped
the utensil in his hand, and seizing their arms, all hastened
to the environs of Boston. In a few days, a large army
was assembled, which, under the command of general
Ward, of Massachusetts, and general Putnam, of Connecticut, closely-invested the town, and alarmed general Gage
for the safety of his-garrison.
3,8. In the remoter provinces, the intelligence was considered of solemn and alarming import. The great drama
was opened, and the. part which each should take must
immediately be chosen. By many a resort to arms had
never been anticipated. To them, the decision was more
painful; but all the colonies, except Georgia, adopt.d at
once the heroic resolution to unite their fbltunes.with
those of New-Entgland.
39. Connecticut had pouired forth her fuill proportion of
hardy yeomanry to man the lines around Boston; but
several, who remained at home, conceived the project oP
surprising Ticonderoga, a fortified post on the western
sltore of Lake Champlain, and comrnmanding the entrance
into Canad(a. They commliicated their design to colonel
[1775.1775.1  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
Ethan Allen, of Vermont, who, upon their arrival at Castleton with forty men, met them there at the head of two
hundred and thirty Greern Mountaini boys. Th6next day,
cai)talm Bel.edict Arnold, of Connecticut, who, upon the
first alarm, had hastened to Boston, arrived from that
place, having conceived the same project, and been authorized, by the committee of safety in Massachusetts, to
undertake it.
40.:Allen and Arnold-at the head of the Green Mountain
boys, hastened to Ticonderoga, and the remainder of the
party to Skeensborough. On the night of the ninth of
MAay, about eighty, all that the boats could carry, crossed
the lake, and, at dawn of day, landed near the fortress.'T'hey advanced to the gateway. A sentinel snapped his
fusee at colonel Allenrt anid retreated. The Americans,
following, found the commander in bed. Colonel Allen
demanded the surrender of the fort. "By what authority
do you demand it.' "In the name," replied Allen, " of
the Great Jehoval and the Continental Congress." The
British officer, having, but fifty men, saw that resistance
would be vain, and agreed to surrender.
41. When the remainder of the party arrived, they were
despatched, under colonel Seth Warner, to take possession
of Crown Point; and Arnold, hastily manning a schooner,
sailed to capture a sloop of war lying at the outlet of the
lake. These two expeditions, as well as that against
Skleensborough, were saccessful; and thus was obtained,
without bloodshed, the command of those important posts,
toTethei with more than one hundred pieces of cannon,
and other munitions of war. The unexpected news of
this brilliant success imparted high courage and animation
to tihe Americans.
42. Most of the militia, who had repaired to Boston,
returned soon after to their homes, but a sufficient number
remained, posted near the Neck, to prevent the British
fromn leaving the town by land. Between detachments
from these and parties of regulars, who were often sent to
collect forage on the islands in the harbor, frequent skirnishes took place, in most of which thle Americans were
successlul.
43. In the heginning of June, several transports, filled
with troops, commanded by generals Howe, Clinton, and
Burgoyne, arrived from Englandl, and, general Gage began
to act with mnore decision and x igor. He issued a proclamnation declaring those in arms, and all who' aided then4

149CHAPTER I.
HISTORY OF VIRGINIA.
TnE London Company, soon after its incorporation in
1606, despatched to America three ships, having on board
one hundred and five persons, destined to begin a settlement in South Virginia. Christopher Newport commanded the squadron. He was accompanied by captain Gosnold and other distinguished individuals; some allured by
curiosity, and some by the prospect of gain, to visit a
country said to be inhabited by a new race of beings, and
to abound in silver and gold.
2. A sealed box was delivered to Newport, with directions that it should not be opened until twenty-four hours
after the emigrants had landed in America. During the
voyage, violent dissensions arose among the principal personages on board thc squadron. Of most of them,.lohn
Smith, one of the adventurers, incurred the distrust and
hatred. His superior talents, and the fame he had acquired by his exploits in war, excited their envy, and probably caused hini to claim for himself greater deference
than they were willing or bound to yield.
3. In his youth hlie had been a merchant's apprentice.
At the age of fifteen, he quitted his master and travelled
in France, the Netherlands, Egypt, and Germany. Having joined the army of the emperor of Austria, who was
then at war with the Turks, he received, as a reward for
a; Jiceessful stratagem, the command of a troop of horse.
4. In three personal combats with Turkish championsa,
he came off victorious, at each time killing his adversary.
In a battle which subsequently took place, he was wounded
and taken prisoner. After his recovery, he was sent as a
slave to Constantinople. He had fallen into the hands of
a cruel master; but his mistress, captivated by his fine
appearance and heroic character, and commiserating his
fate, sent'him, in the absence of her husband, to her brother, who dwelt near the sea of Asoph.. He, disregarding
her directions, assigned to Smith degrading and laborious
tasks, and beat him without mercy whenever he failed to
perform them.
5. Seizing a favorable opportunity, he killed his new
master and fled into Russia.  After visiting Germany,
Fiance, Spain, and Morocco, he returned to Englaad15i   REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
rebels and traitors, and threatened to punish them as such,
unless they immediately returned to their peaceful occupations. He promised his majesty's pardon to all who
should in this manner give proof of their repentance and
amendment, excepting Samuel Adams and John Hancock,
whose crimes, he alleged, were too flagitious to admit of
pardon.
44. This proclamation, and the arrival of the troops, far
from dismaying, aroused the people to greater activity and
watchfulness. Again the militia assembled and surrounded
Boston. Unwilling to endure the inconvenience and disgrace
of this confinem3nt, general Gage made preparation to
penetrate, with t portion of his army, into the country.
To prevent this, the provincial generals resolved to occupy
Bunker's Hill, an eminence in' Charlestown, situated on a
peninsula that approaches near to Boston.
45. On the evening of the 16th of June, a thousand men,
under the command of colonel Prescot, of Mlassachusetts,
colonel Stark, from New-Hampshire, andcaptain Knowlton,
from Connecticut, were despatched on this service. They
were conducted, by mistake, to Breed's Hill, which was
nearer to the water and to Boston, than Bunker's. At
twelve o'clock they began to throw up entrenchments,
and by-dawn of day, had completed a redoubt eight rods
square. As soon as they were discovered, they were fired
upon from a ship of war and several floating batteries lying
near, andfrom a fortification in Boston opposite the redoubt.
The Americaits, nevertheless, encouraged by general Putnam, who often visited them on the hill, continued to labor
until they had finished a slight breastwork extending from
the redoubt eastward to the water. And in the morning
they received a reinforcement of five hundred men.
46. The temerity of the provincials astonished and
incensed general Gage, and he determined to drive them
immediately from their position.'- out noon, a body of
three thousand regulars, commanded by general Howe,
left Boston in boats and landed in Charlestown, at the
extreme point of the peninsula. Generals Clinton and
Burgoyne took their station on an eminence in Boston,
commanding a distinct view of the hill. The spires of
the churches, the roofs of the houses, and all the heights,
in the neighborhood were covered with people, waiting,
in dreadfulanxiety, to witness the approaching battle.
37. The regulars, forming at the place of landing,
marchlied slowly up the hili, halting frequently to allow

time to the artillery to demolish the works. While ad'
vancing, the village of Charlestown, containing about four
hlundred houses, was set oil fire by order of general Gage.
The flames ascended to a lofty height, presenting a sublime
and magnificent spectacle. The Americans reserved their
fire until the British were within ten rods of the redoubt;
then, taking a steady aim, they began a furious discharge.
Entire rankis of the assailants fell. The enemy halted
and returned the fire but that from the redoubt continuing
incessant and doing great execution, they retreated in haste
and disorder down the hill, some even taking refuge in
their boats,
48. The officers were seen running hither and thither,
collecting, arranging and addressing their men, who were
at length induced again to ascend the hill. The Ameri-.,aas now reserved their fire until the enemyhad approached,ven nearer than before, when a tremendous volley was
t once poured upon them. Terrified by the'carnage around
ihem, they again retreated with precipitation, and such
was the panic that general Howe was left almost alond
(,n the hill side, his troops having deserted him and nearly
every,officer around him being killed,  
49. At this moment, general Clinton, who had observed
trom Boston the progress of the battle, feeling that British
honor was at stake, hastened withi a reinforcement to the
assistance of iis countrymetn. Byhis exertions, the troops
were a third time rallied, and were compelled by the officers, who marched behind them with drawn swords, to
advance again towards the Americans. The fire from the
ships and batteries was redoubled, and a few pieces of
cannon lhtd been so placed as to rake the interior of the
breastwork from end to end.
50. The provincials hlaving expended their amrmunition,
awaited in silence the approach of the regulars. The
latter entered the redoubt.  The former, having no
bayonets, defended themselves, for a short time, with the
Ibutt enrd of their muskets.  From this unequal contest
they were soon compelled to retire. As thiey retreated
over Charlestown Neck, the fire from the floating batte -
ties was incessant hutt, providentially, a few only were
killed. The enemy had sustained too mutch injury to think
of pursuit.
51. In this desperate and bloody conflict, the royal forese
consisted, as has been stated,.f three thousand men, and
the provincials of but fifteen hlndred. Of the formner, one

thousand and fifty-four were killed arid wounded; of the
latter, four hundred and( fifty-three.  Tlhis disparity of
loss, the steadiness and bravery displayed by their recent,
undisciplined levies, occasioned among the Americans the
highest exultation, and, in- their view, more than counter
halanced the loss of position. If this is a British victory
how mnany such victories, they triumphantly asked, can
their army achieve without ruin  
52. But deep and heart-felt sorrow was intermingled
with their rejoicings. Among the killed, was doctor
Warren, a patriot, who, at an early period, had espoused
with warmth the cause of freedom; who had dispiayed
great intrepridity in several slirmishes; had four days
before been elected major-general;.and had, on the fatal
day, hastened to the field of battle, to serve his country
as a volunteer. For his many virtties, his elegant manners,
his generous devotion to his country, his high attainments
in political science, he was beloved and respected by hi;
republican associates; and to him their affections pointed
as a fututire leader, in a cause dear to their hearts, and
intimately connected with thteir glory.  
53. In the midst of these military transactions, a continental congress assembled at Philadelphia.,It comprised
delegates from twelve colonies, all of whomn were animated
with a determined spirit of opposition to parliamentary
taxation. A majority, lowever, had not yet formined the
hardy resolution to separate fromrn the mother country, and
aim at independence.  The measures partook of the opposite feelinlgs of the members. Mr. Hancocki the proscribed
patriot, was chosen president; they resolved that another
humble petition for redress of grievances shotld be pre--
sented to the king; but they also resolved that means of
defence should be immediately preepared, and proceeded to
the choice of officers to commiand their united forces.
54. To induce the friends of liberty in the. southlern
provinces, to embark more warmly in the cause of resistance, the northern delegates determined to give their
suffrages, fi)r a commander-in-chief, to a person residing
in that quiarter.  Fortunately, one was found emninently
qualified fior the office.'By unanimous vote of the congress
GEORGaP WASHINGTON, then present as deleffate fron Virginia, was elected. HIe had served, with high reputation,
in the late war with France; was distinguished iii his.
native province for his military knowledge, his great
wealth, -thle dignity of his deportmient, his unsuspected
[17751775.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
integrity, and his ardent attachment to the interests of his
country
55. The president addressing him in his seat, announceal
to him the choice which the congress had made. Washington declared his acceptance with a diffidence which
gave to his great talenits a brighter lustre; and assured
congress that, as no pecuniary compensation could have
tempted him to accept the office, at the sacrifice of his
domestic ease and happiness, he would receive no pay, and
would ask only the remuneration of his expenses. Artemas Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler, and Israel Putnam, were then chosen major-generals, and Horatio Gates
adjutant-general. Lee had lately held the office of colonel,
and Gates that of major, in the British army.
56. Congress also resolved that, for defraying the expenses which might be incurred, bills of credit, or paper
money, to the amount of three millions of dollars, should
he issued, and pledged the colonies for their redemption.
A solemn and dignified declaration, setting forth the
causes and necessity of taking up arms, was prepared to
be published to the army in orders, and to the people from
the pulpit. After particularizing the aggressions of Great
Britain, with the energy of men feeling unmerited injury,
they exclairnm:
57. "But why should we enumerate our injuries in detail? By one statute it is declared that parliament can of
right make laws to bind us in all cases whatsoever. What
is to defend us against so enormous, so unlimited a power?
Not a-single man of those who assume it, was chosen by
us, or is subject to our control or influence; but, on tlhe
contrary, they are all of them exempt from the operation
of such laws, and an American revenue, if not diverted
from the ostensible purposes for which it is raised, would
actually lighten their own burdens, in proportion as it increases ours. We saw the misery to which such despotism would reduce us. We, for ten years, incessantly and
ineffectually besieged the throne as supplicants; we reasolned, we remonstrated with parliament in the most mild
and decent language.
58. "We are now reduced to the alternative of choosing
an unconditional submission to the will of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choic.
We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing
so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, ano
umanity forbid us tamnely to surrender that freedom which
153164    REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our
innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. WVe
cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding
generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits
them if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.
59. " Our cause is just; our union is perfect. Oti
internal resources are great; and, if necessary, foreign
assistance is undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully acknowledge, as a signal instance of the divine favor towards
us, that his providence would not permit us -to be called
into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to
our present strength, had:been previously exercised in warlike operations, and possessed the means of defending
ourselves.
60. "With hearts fortified by these animatingreflections,
we most solemnly, before God and the world, nEcLARE, that
exerting the utmost energy of those powers, whiclh omir
beneficent Creator hathl graciously bestowed, the arms we
have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will,
in defianceof every hazard, with unabating firmness and
perseverance, employ for the preservation of our liberties
being, with onre mrind, resolved to die freemen rather than
to live slaves."
61.. Soon after his election, general Washington, accompanied by general Lee, and several other gentlemen, set
out fi(r the camp at Cambridge. In every place through
which he passed, he received the highest honors. A comnmittee from the provincial congress of Massachusetts, met
him at Springfield, and conducted himn to head-quarters,
whlere another committee presented him a respectful and
affectionate address.
6:f2. He foutnd the army, consisting of fourteen thousand
men, posted on the heights around Boston, tforming a line
which' extended from Roxbury on the right, to the river
Mystic on the left, a distance of twelve mniles. The
troops were ardently devoted to the cause of liberty, b,it
destitulte of discipline, averse to sulbordination, without
powvder, without tents, and without most of the conveniences usually provided for regular armies.
63. WVith the assistance of general Gates, he introduced
somne degree of regularity and system. Several barrels of
_powder were obtained from New-Jersey, and captain Manly,
commander of the privateer Lee, captured an ordnance
ship, containing arms, ammunition, and a complete:assortwent of such worldking tools as were most needed in the'[1775.1775.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
American camp. This providential capture was followed
by others which supplied the most pressing wants of the
army, enabled it to continue, through the year, the blockade of Boston, and contributed greatly to distress the
enemy, for whose use the cargoes were destined.
64. Events occuring this year, in the southern colonies,
still farther weakened the attachment of the people to
Great Britain. In Virginia, Lord Dunmore, the governor,
seized by night, some powder belonging to the colony, and
conveyed it on boaid a British ship in James river. Intelligence of this transaction reaching Patrick Henry, he
placed himself at the hiead of the independent companies
in his vicinity, and marched towards the seat of government, with the avowed purpose of obtaining, by force,
restitution of the powder, or its value. He was met by a
messenger, who paid him the value of the powder, when
he and the militia returned to their homes.
65. Alarm-ed by this display of spirit and patriotism,
lord Dunmore fortified his palace. From this castle, he
issued a proclamation charging Henry and his associates
with rebellious practices, which offended the people, who
highly approved their conduct. Other causes increasing
the populal- ferment, he quitted his palace, and repaired to
a ship of war then lying at Yorktown.
66. In November, he issued another proclamation, offering freedom to those slaves belonging to rebel masters, who
shouild join his majesty's troops at Yorktown. Several
hundred, in consequence, repaired to that place. A body
of inilitia immediately assembled, and, while posted neathe city, were attacked, with great bravery, by the regulars,
royalists, and negroes. The militia, repelling the attack
with equal bravery, gained a decisive victory. Lord Dunmore then evacuated the city, and, followed by his white
and black forces, sought refuge on board the ships of his
majesty. Soon after, Norfolk, set on fire by his order, was
mostly consumed, and its destruction was completed by the
provincials, to prevent the enemy from deriving supplies
from that quarter.
67. The governor of North-Carolina, following the example of lord Dunmore, fortified his palace at Newbern.
This caused a commotion among the people, which induced
him to retire on board a ship in the harbor. While there,
he made zealous exertions to organize a party in favor of
the royal cause; and a band of Scotch Highlanders, settled
in the interior country, listened to his persuasions. On

their march to the sea coast, they were met by a party of
rnmilitia, who, attacked and dispersed them.: This earlv
victory secured the predominance of the whigs, and crushed
the hopes and spirits of the tories.

and zeal, resisted parliamientary taxation: and soon,aftel

bell, apprehensive of danger to his person, retired from
the province. In July, Georgia chose delegates to the
continental congress, increasing to THIRTEEN the number
of the UNITED COLONIES.
69. The province of New-York contained many warm
advocates for freedom; but its capital had so lonrg been
the head-quarters of the British army.in America, that
many of the principal inhabitants, having contracted intimate relations with British officers, had become devoted
to the royal cause. The assembly, acting under their influence, declined to choose delegates to the continental coingress held in May, 1775; but the people, a majority of
whom were actuated by different feelings, elected a provincial congress, by whom those delegates were chosen.
70. When intelligernce of the battle of Lexington reached the city, captain Sears, an active and intrelpid leader of
the "sons of liberty," took effectual measures to prevent
vessels bound to ports in Amerca, where the royal cause
prevailed, from sailing. An. association was also formed,
consisting of one thousand of the principal inhabitants,
who bound themselves to assist iu carrying into execution
whatever measure might be recommended, by-the cornlinental congress, to prevent the execution of the oppressive
acts of the British parliament.
71. The ministry, desirous of retaining in obedience
this important colony, appoi-rnted Mr. Tryon, to be governor
over it. He had before filled the same office; was a man
of address, and greatly beloved by the people. He caine
fully empowered to gain adherents by dispensing promises
antd money at his discretion. The success of his intrigues
alarmed congress, who, having particular.reference to him,
recommended that "all persons whose going at large might
eniidanger the liberties of America, should be arrested -and
secured."  Gaining early intelligence of this, lie also
sought refuge on board a shlip in the harbor..72. Although the autumn of 1775 was not distinguished
by any brilliant exploit, yet the time of congress and of
the cominander-in-chief, was not unprofitably employed.
[1775.1776.1  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.     7
Constant attention was paid to the discipline of the troops;
arrangements were made to obtain a supply of military
stores; the building and equipment of a naval force was
commenced; two expeditions were organized and despatched against Canada, one by the way of lake Chainplain,
tile other of the river Kennebeck; and general Lee, with
twelve hundred volunteers from Connecticut, was directed
to proceed to New-York, and, with'the aid of the inhabitants, fortify the city and the highlands.
73. The abolition of all legal authority in the colonies
was an evil for which, though less than had been anticipated, it was yet expedienlt to provide a remedy. NewHampshire applied to congress for advice on this subject.
A favorable opportunity was thus presented to the zealous
patriots in congress, to propose a remedy for the evil,
which should, at the same time, exhibit in practice the
fundamental principle of their political creed, that all
legitimate authority must be derived from the people; and
should also prepare the way for their darling object, a
declaration of independence.
74. A resolution was introduced, recommending that a
convention of representatives, freely elected by the people
of that colony, should be called, for the p)urpose of establishing such a form of government as they miglt deem
proper. It was warmly opposed by those members who
were yet desirous of an accommodation with the mother
country. An amendment being made, providing that the
government established should continue in force no longer
than the existing contest with Great Britain, the resolution passed. Representatives were accordingly chosen,
who, on the 5th of January, 1776, adopted a written constitution, acknowledging no source of power but the people. In other colonies, the same course was soon afterwards p!sued.      -
75. A transaction, displaying the vindictive feelings of
the British, occurred in October. The ministry had issued
orders to the officers of the navy to proceed, as in the
case of actual rebellion, against all the colonial seaports
accessible to ships of war, which should discover symptoms of attachment to the cause of liberty. Falnmouth, a
flourishing town in Massachusetts, having given some
particular offence, its destruction, under color of these
orders, was resolved on, and captain Mowatt, with four
ships, was despatched on that service.
76. The citizens made an effort, by negotiation, to avert
0..
157158         REVOLUTIONARY          WAR.         [1776.
their ruin; but as the terms which were offered could not
be accepted without dishonor, they were at once rejected.
The bombardment immediately commenced, the town was
set on fire, and four hundred buildings reduced-to ashes:'
This wanton act of devastation was strongly reprobated
throughout America, and served to inflame, rather than to
intimidate, the people. The town has since been rebuilt,
its name changed to Portland, and it is now the capital of
Maine.
77. As the year 1775 drew near to a close, the condition
of the army, employed in the blockade of Boston, engaged
the atteition of congress. A speedy adjustment of the
dispute being at first expected, the men had been enlisted
to serve only until the first of January. No prospect now
appfeifban immediate accommodation. It was therefore resolved to form a new army, to consist of twenty
thousand nen, and to be raised, as far as practicable, from
the troops theii in service. Unfortunately it was determined, that the enlistments should be made for one year
only, an error the consequences of which were afterwards
very severely felt.
78. It was supposed that most of those whom patriotism
had impelled to join the army, would continue in the
service of their country; but when the experiment was
made, it was found that their ardor had considerably
abated. The blockade of Boston presented no opportunity
of acquiring glory, by deeds of noble daring; the fatiguing
duties of the camp wore upon their spirits, affected their
health, and produced an unconyquerable longing to revisit
their homes. Notwithstanding the great exertions of
general Washington, no more than half the- estimnated
number had been enlisted at the close of the year.
79. The people and the troops, supposing the army to
be stronger than it was, expressed great dissatisction at
the inactivity of the commander-in-chief, whlich some
imputed to dishonorable motives. An attack upon Boston
was loudly demanded. WVashington three times proposed
it to a council of war; but in every instance the decision
was unanimous against it. At the last time, however, the
council recommended that the town should be more closely
invested. On the evening of the fourth of March 1776,
the attention of the enemy being diverted, by a brisk
cannonade, to a different quarter, a party of troops, under
the command of general Thomas, tookl possession, in
silence, of Dorchester heights, and with almost incredible1775.]     REVOLUTIONARY- WAR.                   159
industry, erected, before morning, a line of fortifications
which commanded the harbor and the town.
80. The view of these works, raised like an exhalation
from the earth, excited the astonishment'of general Howe,
who, on the resignation of general Gage, had been appointed commander-in-chief. He saw that he must immediately
dislodge the Americans or evacuate the town. The next
day he ordered 3000 men to embark in boats and proceeded,
by way of Castle Island, to attack the works on the
heights. A firious storm dispersed them; the fortifications, in the mean time, were rendered too strong to be
forced; and general Howe was compelled to seek safety
in an irmmediate departure from Boston.
81. Of the determination of the enemy to evacuate the
town, general Washington was soon apprized. The event
being certain, he did not wish by an attack to hasten it, as
the fortifications at New-York, to which place he presumed they would repair, were not in sufficient forwardness
to protect it. Tlhe embarkation was made on the 17th of
March; a few4.days after, the whole fleet set sail, and the
Americanr arrriT hastened, by divisions, to New-York.

and spirited conduct, a medal of gold was orderem.4d- b.

EXPEDITION AGAINST CANADA.
IT has been already stated, that two expeditions were
despatched against Canada. The command of that, which
was to proceed by way of lake Champlain, was given to
general Schuyler of New-York.. The number of troops
to be employed was fixed at three thousand, and they were
to be drawn from New-York and New-England. Governor Carleton, gaining intelligence of the project, despatched
about eight hundred men to strengthen the works at St.became acquainted with Gosnold, tfnd was easily persuaded
to embark in an expedition to a country he had not yet
visited, in search of new scenes and new adventures.
While yet at sea, he was accused of an intention to mur
der the council, usurp the government, and make himself
king of Virginia; and upon this absurd accusation was put
in confinement.
6. The place of their destination was the disastrous
position of the Roanoke. A storm fortunately drove them
to the mouth of Chesapeake bay, which they entered on
the 26th of April, 1607. Discovering a large and beautiful river, they gave it the name of James River, ascended
it, and on its banks had several interviews with the natives.
7. In one of these a chief came forward, holding in one
hand his bow and arrows, in the other a pipe of tobacco,
and demanded the cause of their coming. They made
signs of peace, and were received as friends. Paspiha,
another chief, when informed of their wish to sett-le in the
country, offered them as much land as they wanted, and
sent them a deer for their entertainment.
8. On the 13th of May, they debarked at a place which
they called Jamestown. On opening the sealed box, it
was found to contain the names of thre council and instructions for their guidance. In the list were the names of
Gosnold, Smith, Wingfield, and Newport. Wingfield was
elected president, and a vote was passed excluding Smith
fromn his seat at the board. He was, however, released
from confinement.
9. The whole country was then a wilderness, in which
a fiew Indians roamed in pursuit of their enemies, or of
wild beasts for food. In color they were darker than the
European, but not so black as the negro. They possessed
all the vices and virtues of the savage state; were cunning in stratagem, ferocious in battle, cruel to their conquered enemies, kind and hospitable to their friends. They
had no written lanrguage; they were unacquainted with
the use of iron and the other metals; their weapons of
war were a bow and arrows, a stone hatchet, which they
called a tomahawk, and a club. They lived lprincipally
by hunting, but sometimes cultivated small patches of
Indian corn.
10. From such neighibors the emigrants could expect
but little aid or comfort. Yet they took no care to provide
for their-fiture subsistence or preservation. They planted nothing-lthe first year. The provisions brought from

Johns, on the river Sorel, a position commanding the usual
entrance into Canada.
2. Brigadier general Montgomery, a young officer of
brilliant talents, and ambitiots of glory, was ordered to
proceed in advance, with the troops, then in readiness, and
attack this important position, before it had been made too
strong to be taken. When commencing his career, the
glory and fate of Wolfe were present to his thoughts, and
to his wife his parting words were, "you shall never blush
for your Montgomery." Genleral Schuyler soon followed,
and on arriving at Isle aux Noix, inl the vicinity ot the
British works, lie addressed a proclamation to the Canadians, exhorting them to join their brethren in the cause ot
freedomr, and declaring that the American army came as
fiiends of the inhabitants, and as enemies only of tlhe
British garrisons.
3. The fortifications at St. Johns being found stronger
than was anticipated, general Schuyler returned to Albany
to hasten the departure of the remainring troops, artillery
and munitions of war. He was prevente(d, by a severe
illness, from again joining the army, and the chief commanddevolved upon Montgomery. On receivinga reilf Io rcement, hle invested St. Johns: but being yet almost destitutte
of battering cannon and of powder, he made no progress
i:tihb:t- siege. And the soldiers, carrying with theml into
the field that attachment to liberty and equality which
gave birth to the contest, displayed such utter aversion to
discipline and subordination as increased, in agreat degree,
his difficulties and vexations.
4. Colonel Allen, the hero of Ticonderoga, had a com.
mand under Montgoriery. Having been despatched, with
major Brown, into the interior of Canada, he was, on his
ret   ersuaded by the latter to undertake the rash proje"~f~i[ttacking Montreal. Hle divided his detachllment,
consi0sting of less than three hundred men, into two
parties, intending to assail the city at opposite points.
Major Brown was prevented from executing his part of the
enterprise. Colonel Allen and his small party, opposed by
the whole force of the enemy'under governor Carleton,
fought with desperate valor. Many were killed; the survivers, overpowered by numbers, were compelled to surrender. The governor, viewing Allen, not as the intrepid
soldier, but as a factious rebel, loaded him with irons and
sent himn to England for trial.

5. On the 18th of October, a fortutnate eveht brighten.
ed the prospects of the Americant, Fort Chambleesituated several miles north of St. Johns, was supposed
to be ieyond their reach, and was but slighttly guarded. A
detachment under tnmjors Brown and Livingston, attacking
it iunexpectedlyf gained possession of it with little loss.
Several pieces of cannon, and 120 barrels of poWder~ were
the fruits of the victory. The Amiericans, encouraged by
success, immediately, in defiance of the continual fire of
thile elemny, erected a battery near fort St. Johns, and
made preparations for a severe cannonade, and an assault,
if necessary.
6. At this juncture, Montgomery received intelligence
of an action between governor Carletoit and a body of
Green Moulntain boys commanded by colonel Warnter.''The formner, elated by hltis victory over Allen, collected
about eight hundred( regulars, militia, and Indians, with the
view of raising the siege of St. J(,ohns. In full confidence
of success, they lett Montreal, enmbarked in boats, and
proceeded towards the southern sh(,re of the St. Lawrernce. In the bushes at the water's edge colonel Warner,
having received infobrmationll of their purpose, concealed
three hundred men, who, when the enemy approached the
shlore, poured upon them a fire so unexpected and destructive, that the flotilla returned, in confision, to Montreal.
7. On the first of November, Montgomery ccmmenced
a heavy coureanlade of the enemny's works, which was
continued throlugh the day. In the evening, he sent to
the British commander, by one of governor Carleton's
mene, who had been made prisoner by colonel Warner, intelligence of tlhe governor's defeat, and demanded the
surrend(er of the fort. It was accord(lingly surrendered,
and the next morning entered by the Amnerican tre.?6
8. Montgomery hastened to Montreal, and, a.
time, despatched down the Sorel, thle mouth of vlich is
below that city, a naval force to prevent the escape of the
British to Quebec. Governor Car]eton, believingthe city not
tenable, quitted it in the night, and, in a boat with mnuffled
oars, was conveyed throtgh the American squadron. The
next day, general Montgomery entered the city, and although
no terms were granted to the inhabitants, he treated them
with the kindness of a fellow citizen, declaring that the
property, rights, and religion of every individual should bh
sacredly respected.
9. By his benev,ol,nce and address, hb, mained the affe-.1h1162

tions of the Canadians, many of whom joined his standard.
More, however, of his own troops, whose term of enlistment had expired, insisted on retarning to their homes.
So dear to them were the-delights of the domestic fireside,
and so vividly were they recalled to miemory by the severe
duties of the campaign, that the high character of the commander, his address, his entreaties, availed nothing to induce them to proceed on the expedition. With the remnant
of his army, consisting of no more than three hundred men,
lie began his march towards Quebec, expecting to meet
there another body of troops sent to act in concert with him.
10. These troops were a detachmrent from the army before
Boston, consisting of one thousand meni, and commanded
by colonel Arnold; who, as a soldier, was adventurons,
impetuous, and fearless; as a man, overbearing, avaricious,
and profligate. Their route lay along the coast to the
mouth of the Kennebec, in Maine, thence up that river to
its source, and thence, over lofty mountains, through a
wilderness unexplored by civilized man, to the river St.
Lawrence. They wtre unable to begin their marehi befores
the middle of September; on the 22d, they embarked inl
boats, at Gardner, on the Kennebec, and proceeded to
ascend that river.
11. They found the current rapid, and the navigation
interrupted by frequent cataracts. Around these they
were obliged to draw, by hand, their provisions, arms, and
even their boats. Nor was their route on land less difficult. They had deep swamps to pass, and craggy mountains to ascend. The toil was so incessant, and the fatigue
so great, that many, falling sick, were sent back, and along
with these the rear division, commanded by colonel Enos,
returned without the knowledge of Arnold.
X,:.Jefore they reached the height of land, provisions'b*OAs:carce. Dogs, cartridge-boxes, and shoes were
eateni..' At the summit, the whole stoclk was divided
equally among them, each receiving but two quarts of
flour as his portion. T'he erder of march was no longer
observed. The soldiers were directed to proceed, singly
or by companies, as they might choose, slowly or with
speed, as they were able, to the nearest Canadian settle.
ment, then one hundred miles distant. When the company, whose superior strength enabled them to keep in
advance, were thirty miles from any human habitation,
the last morsel of food had been consumed.
13. In this extremity, Arnold, with a few of the mlost1775.1  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
T3
vigorous, made a forced march to the first village, and
returned to his almost famiished companions, with food
sufficient to satisfy the first wants of nature. Refreshed
and strengthened, they hastened forward, and, on the fourth
of November, arrived at the French settlements on the
Chaudiere, having been thirty.two days without seeing
the abodes of civilized man; and having, in that time, performed a march unexampled for its temerity and hardship.
14. The inhabitants welcomed them with cordial hosritality. Though separated, in a great measure, from the
world, they had heard of the dispute between Great Britain
arid her colonies, and as the very name of liberty is dear
t,) the heart of man, their sympathies were all enlisted on.
41e side of the latter. Arnold distributed proclamations
anong them similar to those issued by general Schuyler.'s soon as the scattered soldiers were assembled, he connued his march, and, on the ninth of November, arrived,I, Point Levi, opposite Quebec.
15. Nothing could exceed the surprise and astonishment
r,f the citizens on seeing a body of hostile troops, emerging
from the southern wilderness. Had Arnold, at this momernt of panic, been able to cross the river, the city must
have fallen an easy conquest; hbut boats were not at hand,
and a furiouls storm, occurring at the time; rendered crossing imnpossible.
16. Having pl)rocured boats, and the storni having abated,
he crossed the river on the!,ight of the 13th, and landed
near the place where Wolfe had landed in the preceding
war.  Mounlting the same steep ascent, he %rmed his
troops on the plains of Abraham, and marched towards
the city. Convinced, by a cannonade from the walls, that
the garrison were ready to receive him, he returned, encamped on the plain, and on the 18th marched to Point
aux Trembles, twenty miles from Quebec, where he
determined to await the arrival of Montgomery.
17. He came on the first of December. How great was
the joy, and how lively the gratulations, they only can
imagine, who, after long absence ar.d suffering, have met,
in a foreign land, their friends and former companions.
Arn6ld's troops had, indeed, great cause of rejoicing.
They were entirely destitute of winter clothing, and had
endured extreme distress from the severity of the cold.
Montgomery had brought a supply from Montreal, which
he immnediately distributed aniong them.
18. Their united force amounted to ino more than nine
L164    REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
hundred effective men. On the fifth, the general, at the
head of these, appeared before the city, and sent a flag
with a summons to surrender. The delay which had taken
place, had enabled governor Carleton to increase the
strength of the works, and to change the sentiments of
the citizens from friendship for the Americans, to hostility
He ordered his troops to fire upon the bearer of the flag.
19. Montgomery soon discovered the defection of his
friends, and perceived that he must depend upon his own
force alone for the accomplishment of his object. When
he compared this force with that of the enemy, who were
fifteen hundred strong; when he reflected that his troops
were recent levies whose term was nearly expired, and
whose thoughts were fixed upon their homes, his hopes
of success became faint, and his forebodings gloonmy. lie
believed. however, that success was possible, and his high
sense ot honor and of duty impelled himrn to hazard every
thing to obtain it for h;s country.
20. He at first determined to batter the walls, and
harass the city, by repeated and furious attacks, hoping
that an opportunity might occur of strikliing some decisive
blow. He raised a mound, composed of snow and water"
which soon became ice, and there planted his cannons,
six only in number. After a short trial, they were found
inadequate, and this plan was abandoned.
21. Meanwhile, the snow fell incessantly, the cold
became intense, and the sufferings of the troops, from tlhe
rigor of the seaseon and their continual toil, surpassed all
that they had ever before felt, or witnessed, or imagined.
To increase their distress, the small pox broke out in the
camp, presenting death in a new shape, and adding to the
severity of their labors, by lessening the number to bear
them.  In the midst of these trials, their attachlment
to the cause, an, devotion to their commander remained
unabated; but these, he reflected, must soon give way
before such severe and constant suffering; and for himself, he determined to make immediately a bold and desperate effort.
22. Assembling his officers, he proposed to storm the
city. He placed before them the motives which operated
upon his own mind. He did not deny that the enterprise
was highly difficult and dangerous, but maintained that
sucecess was possible. He addressed a band of heroes
whose sentiments were congenial with his own, and the
decision was unanimous in favor of his proposition. The
[17751775.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
plan and time of attack were concerted, and to each officer
was assigned his particular duty.
23. On the last day of December, at four o'clock in the
morning, while a violent snow storm was raging, the troops
mnarched from the camp in four columns, commanded by
Montgomery, Arnold, Livingston, and Brown. The two
latter were directed to make feigned attacks upon the
upper town, in order to distract the attention of the garrison; while the two former proceeded to assault the lower
town at opposite points.
24. Livingston and Brown, impeded by the snow, did
not arrive in season to execute their feints. Montgomery,
advancing, at the head of his column, along the bank of
the river, came to a barrier or stockade of strong posts.
Two of these he sawed off with his own hands. The
guard withinwere alarmed, and fled to a block-house, fifty
yards di tant, where several pieces of.cannon were stationed. He passed through the opening in the barrier,
encouraging his men to follow. The troops at the blockhouse, to whom the guard had communicated their terror,
begaii to desert it.
25. At this moment, Montgomery halted, to allow the
troops near him to form in a body. Observing this delay,
a Canadian, who lingered behind, returned to the blockhouse, seized a match which was burning, and discharged
a cannon loaded with grape shot, and fortuitously pointed
at the little band. The discharge was instantly fatal to
Montgomery, and to several favorite officers standing
around him. The men, seeing their beloved leader fall,
shrunk back; colonel Campbell, the next in command,
ordered a retreat, and that portion of the garrison stationed
at the block-house, was left at liberty to hasten to another
part of the city, already in commotion from the attack of
Arnold.
26. This officer, marching, like Montgomery, at the
head of his column, had entered the town. Advancing
along a narrow street, which was swept by the grape shot
of the enemy, he received a'severe wound in the leg, and
was carried to the hospital. Captain Morgan, afterwards
distinguished by his exploits at the southl, assumed the
command. Placing himself at the head of two companies,
he boldly approached the enremy's works, and entering
through the embrasures, drove the men-from their guns.
27. Here he halted until the rear of the column came
up. When time was given for reflection, the danger of
J43
165REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
their situation, a small band in-the heart of a hostile city,
filled even the bosoms of the brave with dread. Morgan
retained his firmness; and when the morning dawned,
with a voice that resounded through the city, summoned
his troops to the assault of a second battery, a short
distance in advance of the first.
28. Before this, a fierce combat ensued. Many of the
enemy were killed, but more Americans, who were dxposed toga destructive fire of musketry from the windows
of the houses. Some of the most daring mounted the
wall, but, seeing, on the other side, two ranks of soldiers,
with their muskets on the ground, presenting hedges of
bayonets to receive them, should they leap forward, they
recoiled and descended.
29. Weary with' exertion, and benumbed with cold;
exposed to a deadly fire from every quarter; their arms
rendered useless by the snow which continued to fall, the
soldiers sought refuge in the houses. Perceivinr that
all farther attempts would be vain, Morgan gave the signal
of retreat. Some of the men fled, but mest were unwilling
to encounter another tempest of shot. They refused,
nowever, to yield, until assured of the fate of Montgomery; when, loosing all hope of success and escape, they
surrendered themselves prisoners of war.
30. The loss of the Americans, in this desperate enterprise, was above four hundred, of whom one hundred and
fifty were killed. The whole continent bewailed the
death of Montgomery. -He was conspicuous, even in those
times of enthusiasm, for his ardent devotion to the cause
of freedom. He was endeared to the good, by the exercise, in the midst of war, of the most amiable virtues. His
soldiers adored him for his lofty spirit and daring bravery.
The enemy respected him for his honorable conduct, and
distinguished military qualities. Until his last enterprise,
continual success bore testimony to the greatness of his
talents; and defeat, when he was no more, confirmed the
testimony of success. Congress resolved that a monument should be erected to perpetuate his famne. It lives
yet fresh in the memory of Americans. In 1818, NewYork, his adopted state, removed his remains from Quebec
to her own nietropolis, where the nionument had been
placed, and near that they repose.
31. Some of the Americans, on their escape from
Quebec,-retreated precipitately to Montreal. Arnold, with
diiculty, detained about four hundred, who, breaking up'16.6
[1775.167
1776.1  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
their camp, retired three miles from the city. Here this
heroic band, though much inferior in number to the garrison, kept it in continual awe, and, by preventing all communicaLion with the country, reduced it to great distress
for the want of provisions.
32. Congress, on receiving information of the disaster
of the 31st of December, directed reinforcements to be
sent to Canada; and after the beginning of March, Arnold's
party was almost daily augmented by the arrival of small
b)odies of troops. But its strength did not increase with
its numbers. The small-pox still continued its ravages;
fatigue, without hope, depressed the spirits of the soldiers;
the difficulty of obtaining provisions became every day
greater; and the harsh measures adopted by Arnold to
procure them, exasperated the inhabitants around him.
33. On the first of May, general Thomas, who had
beenl appointed to succeed Montgomery, arrived from the
camp at Roxbury. On reviewing his army, he found i.t to
consist of less than two thousand mnen, of whom half were
not fit for duty. A council of war was held, who resolved
that it was expedient to take a more defensible position
higher up the St. Lawrence. To this decision they wvere
led by the knowledge that the ice was leaving the river,
and by the expectation that reinforcemnents from England
would immediately come up. The next morning, in fact,
while the Americans were engaged in removing the sick,
several ships appeared in sight, and entered the harbor. A
multitude of troops were immediately poured into the city.
34. At one o'clock, Carleton made a sortie at the head
of a thousand men. Against these, general Thomas, at
that momelnt. could oppose but three hundred. All the
stores, and many of the sickl, fell into the power of the
eenemy. The latter were treated, by the governor, with
great tenderness; and when restored to health, were
assisted to return to their homes. The Americans retreated to the mouth of the Sorel, where they were joined
by several regimenits, and-where their worthy commander
died of the small-pox, which yet prevailed in the camp.
35. While patriotism and valor were, in this quarter,
unsuccessfully contending with a superior force, the
Americans sustained a heavy and unexpected calamity,
resulting from cowardice, in another. At a fortified place,
called the Cedars, forty miles above Montreal, colonel
Bedell was stationed with four hundred men, and two
pieces of cannon. Assembling a force of six hundred,
L4REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
mostly Indian warriors, captain Foster, who commanded
at Oswegatchie, descended the river to attack this post..36. Colonel Bedell, leaving major Butterfield in com.
ranad, repaired to Montreal to obtain assistance. Shortly
afterwards, captain Foster appeared, and invested the
fort. He had no artillery, and in the course of two days,
bu:t one man was wounded. More efficient than his arms,
was the intimation, that if any of the Indians should be
killed, it would not be in his power to restrain them fiorm
the mnassacre of the garrison. Intimidated by this, major
liutterfield surrendered his whole party prisoners of war,
stipulating only for their baggage and their lives.
37. Upon thie representation of colonel Bedell, a reinforcemeilt was ordered to march from Montreal; hut lie
declined returning with it, and the command was giveo
to mlajor Sherburne. Tle day after the surrender of thef
fort, of whieh event the iriajor was ignorant, aind about
four miles from it hlie was met by a large body of Indiails
to whom, after an obstinate and bloody conflict, he was
obliged to surrender. The whole loss of the Americans
was at least five hundred.
38. General Sullivan was appointed to succeed general
Thomas, and on the first of June, arrived at the river
Sorel, where he found between four and five thousand
mea.en. B3ut the army of the eneuiy had, in the mean time,
been augmented to thirteen thousand. Commanding a
force so decidedly superiors governor Carleton pressed
forward in pursuit, and the Americans retreated slowly
and reluctanitly before him. At St. Johlns, the pursuit
ceased; but general Sullivan, in obedience to orders friom
general Schuyler, continued his march to Crown Point,
at the head of Lake Champlain.
39. Thus terminated the expedition against Canada.
In its conception it was singu]arly bold and romantic. In
its progress were displayed fortitude and bravery seldom
equalled in. military annals. Its failure was a painful
disappointment to the patriots of the day. It is now
consoling to reflect, that success would probably hlave
proved injurious to the cause of independence. To lrotect the province, the military force of the confederacy
must have been too much extended, and colonies moru
important have been left defenceless.

~1775.CHAPTER XVIll.
CAMPAIGN OF 1776.
THE last humble petition of congress to the king was
pi esented by Mr. Penn, the late governor of Pennsylvania.
A few days afterwards, he was told by the minister that
no answex would be made to it. The haughty spirit,
which dictated this reply, pervaded both houses of parliainent.
2. In December, a law was passed amounting to a
declaration of war against the colonies. Treaties were
made with the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel and other
German princes, hiring of them seventeen thousand men,
to be employed against the Amnericans; and it was determined to send over, in addition to these, twenty-five
thousand English troops.
3. In the beginniag of the year 1776, a fleet under Sir
Peter Parker, and two thousand five hundred troops
commanded by earl Cornwallis, were despatched upon an
expedlition against the southern colonies. Soon after, adriral Hotlram set sail with a large number of transports,
carrying the first division of Hessians; and, in May, folAowed admiral lord Howe, who had been appointed commander of the naval force on the American station. He,
and his brother, general Howe, had also been appointed
oint commissioners to grant pardons on submission.
4. On the first of May, the fleet, under Sir Peter Parker, arrived on the coast of North-Carolina,-where Sir
Henrry Clinton, arriving at the same time from New-York,
took command of the troops. The late defeat of the
hi,ghland emigrants had so dispirited the loyalists in this
colony, that he determined to proceed farther solth, and
attack Charleston, the capital of South-Carolina.
5. Fo'tuu-aateiy, an official letter., announcing the speedy
depa.ture of the expedition from England, had been intercepted early in the spring, and time was thus given to
place this city in a state of defence. A strong fort was
built on Sullivan's island, a position from which ships,
on entering the harbor, could be greatly annoyed; the
streets, in different places, were strongly barricaded; the
stores on the wharves, though of great value, were pulled
down, and lines of defence erected along the water's edge.
G. On learning the near approach of the enemy, the
a    ~ -   nEngland were soon consumed. In foulr months, famine and
the diseases of a hot and damp climate-swept away fifty
of their lnumber.
11. These dreadful distresses led them to reflect upon
thleir situation and conduct. Having become sensible of
their injustice to Smith, they, at his requtest, had granted
him a trial, which resulted in an honorable acquittal. His
personal talents and activity now enforced, in adversity,
the same regard and deference which, in prosperous timnes,
are yielded only to vested authority and official station.
12. By his advice, a fort was erected, to protect them
from the attacks of the Indians. To procure provisions
and explore the country, he made frequent and distant excursvons into the wilderness.  l, one of these he seizea,Ln Indian idol, mrnade withl slcins stuffed with moss, for the
)edemption of which as much corn was brought him as he
required. Sometimes he procured supplies by caresses,
sormetimes by purchase, and when these means failed of
success, Le sc-rupled not to resort to stratagem and violence.
13. But in the midst of his activity and usefulness, he
was, while exploring the source of the river C(hickahominy,
surpl)rised and attacked by a party of Indians. He defended
himself bravely until his companions were killed, when he
turned to flee. Running at hazard, he sunk to his neck
in a swamp andi was taken prisoner.
14. T'he exulting savages conducted him in triamph,
through several towns, to their king, Powhatan. At the
end cf six weeks, their chiefs assembled to deliberate on
his fate. They decided that he should die. He was led
forthl to execution; his head was placed upon a stone, and
an Indian stood near with a club, the instrument of death.
At this instant, Pocahontas, the young and favorite daughter of the kcing, appeared, and rushling between the executioner and the prisoner, folded his head in her arms and
entreated her father to spare his life. Powhatan relented,
directed Smith to be conducted to his wigwam or hut, and
soon afterwards sent him, escorted by twelve guides, to
Jamestown.
15. On his arrival there, he found the number of settlers redutced to thirty-eight, and most of these had determined to abandon the country. By persuasions and threats,
hc induced a majority to rellinquish their design. The remainder, more resolute, went on board a small vessel in
the river. Against these he instantly directed the guns

militia of the country were summnnoned to defend the capital. They obeyed with alacrity, increasing to five or six
thousand the number of troops. General Lee had been
sent from NeW-York to take the chief command; and his
high military reputation gave confidence to the soldiers
and inhabitants. Under him were colonels Gadsden,
Moultrie, and Thompson.
7. In the morning of the 28th of June, nine ships ol
war, carrying two hundred and fifty guns, began a furiois
attack upon the fort on the island, which was garrisoned
by about four hundred men, under the command of coloiel
Moultrie. At the same time, a detachment of troops was
laiided on an adjoining island, and directed to cross over,
at a place where the sea was supposed to be shallow,
and attack it in the rear.
8. The heavy and incessant fire of the enemy was
received with coolness, and returned with skill. Many
of their ships suffered severely, and particularly the Bristol; on board of which was commodore Parker. She was
twice in flames, her captain was killed, and so dreadful
was the slaughter, that, at one time, the commodore was
the only person upon deck unhurt.
9. In the midst of the action, general Lee visited the
garrison. He was delighted with the enthusiasm they
exhibited. Nothing seemed capable of quenchinrg their
ardor. Soldiers, mortally wounded, exhorted their comradles never to abandon the standard of liberty. " I die,"
said sergeant M'Donald, in his last moments, "for a
glorious cause; but I hope it will not expire with me."
10. The British troops, destined to attack the fort in
the rear, found it impossible to reach the island. The
engagement with the fleet continued until dark. The
ships, having received too much injury to renew it, moved
off in the night; and a few days afterwards, the fleet,
with the troops on board, set sail for New-York, whlere
the,whole British force had been ordered to assemble.
11. The killed and wounded on the part of the enemy,
amounted to near two hundred. Of the Amrnericans; ten
were killed, and twenty,two wounded. The troops, for
their gallantry, received the thanklcs of congress, and high
and:well merited praise from their countrymen. Their
success was auspicious to the cause of freedom. In a
part of the country where resistance by force had been
but little contemplated, it aroused the people to exertion,
and inspired them with confidencee
Lir, 6.1776.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
12. Notwithstanding the active war carried on, the
colonies still professed allegiance to the British king; and
protested that the sole object of all their measures, was a
redress of grievances. In the beginning of the contest,
these professions, in most instances, were sincere; but a
state of hostility produced a rapid change of sentiment.
In place of attachment to monarchy and to Great Britain,
succeeded devotion to republican principles, and wishes
oibr independence.
13. The temporary constitutions adopted by NewIHampshire, and several other colonies, had shown with
what facility all bonds of connection with the mnother
country could *be dissolved. Essays in the newspapers,
and pamphlets industriously circulated, appealing to the
the reason and to the passions of the people, enforced the
necessity and policy of a separation. Resistance, it was
observed, had been carried too far to allow the hope that
cordial harmony could ever be restored; submission on
any terms, to irritated masters, would be totally unsafe
and the alternative was presented of rising to the honorable rank of. an independent nation, or sinking into a state
of vassalage which every future year would render more
oppressive and degrading.
14. A pamphlet, entitled' Commoa Sense," and written
by Thomas Paine, an Englishman, was universally read,
an(d most highly admired. In language plain, forcible, and
singularly well fitted to operate on the public mind, he
portrayed the excellencies of republican institutions, and
attacked, with happy and successful ridicule, the principles
of hereditary government. The effect of the pamphlet, in
making converts, was astonishing, and is probably without
precedent in the annals of literature.
15. As a step preparatory to independence, congress, on
the 15th of MAay, recommended to those colonies that had
not yet adopted constitutions, to establish, without any
limitation of time, "such governments as might best condutce to the happiness and safety of the people." The
recommendation was generally complied with, and in every
instance the government was not only entirely elective,
but elective at such short periods as to impress upon rulers
their immediate accountableness to the people, and upon
the people a just opinion of their own importance, and a
convictioni of their safety from misrule.
16. The colonies had become accustomed to contemplate
themselves as sovereign states; and the governments of
171,172    REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
many expressed their desire that congress. would declare
them such to the world. On the 7th of June, a resolution
to that effect was proposed, in that body, by Richard Henry
Lee, of Virginia, and seconded by John Adams, of Massachuisetts. While under consideration, the colonies, which
had not expressed their approbation of the measure,
declared their concurrence. A committee, consisting of
Messrs. Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Sherman, and Livingston, were instructed to prepare a Declaration of Independence, which, on the fourth of July, a memorable day,
was almost unanimously adopted.
17. "We hold these truths," says this celebrated state
paper, "to be self evident, that all mankind are created
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
uilalienable rights; that among these, are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever
any tformn of government becomes destructive of these ends,
it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to
institute a new government, laying its foundations on sucht
principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to
them  shlall seem most likely to effect their safety and
happiness."
18. To justify the exercise, on the presenlt occasion, of!he righlt here asserted, a long enumeration is made of the
injluries inflicted upon the colonies, by the king of Great
Br'itain, which is closed by declaring that "a prince, whose.
character is thus marked by every act which may define
a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people."
19. The appeals whlich had been made to the people of
Great Britain, are also recounted; "but they too have been
(leaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity. We miust
therefore acquiesce to the necessity which denounces cmui
separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind,
enemies in war, in peace friends.,
20. "We, therefore, the representatives of the United
States of Amnierica, in general congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude
of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority, of
the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and
declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought
to be, FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES'; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that
all political connection between themn and the state- of
[1776.'17
1776.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
Great Britain is, and of right ought to be, totally dissolved;
and that, as free and independent states, they have full
power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances,
establish commerce, and do all other acts and things which
independent states may of right do. And for the support
of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of
Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our
lives, our fortunes, and our sacrea honor."
21. This declaration was communicated to the army,
and received with enthusiastic plauditso A great majority
of the people welcomed it with joy, which was displayed,
in almost every city, by extraordinary public festivities.
Those who had been denomrninated tories, were averse to
a separation. Many joined the royal armies, and exhibited,
during the war, the most cruel hostility against the whigs,
their countrymen.
22. During the spring and summer, unremitted exertions
were made to fortify the city of New-York, against which,
it was supposed, the whole strength of the enemy would
be next directed. In this crisis the people of that state
acted withl spirit and firmness. One fourth of the milita
of the counties contiguous to the city, were called into
tlle public service. Yet the means, in the power of the
commander-in-chief, were not adequate to the emergency.
He had under his command but fourteen thousand effective
men; and was almost destitute of many articles which
impart strength as well as comfort to an army. As it was
in the power of the enemy to choose their point of attack,
this force was necessarily divided. A part were stationed
in the city, a part at Brooklyn, on Long Island, and small
detachments at various other posts.

four thousand men, abundantly suppied with uiilitary stores.
The troops were landed on Staten Island, a pos,tion fromn
which ulterior movements could most conveniently be
made.
24. General Washington, presuming that the first attack
would be made upon the posts at Brooklyn, strengthened
it by a detachment of troops from the city, and gave the
command of it to general Putnam. On the 22d of August,
the British forces were landed on the opposite side of
Long Island. The two armies were now about four miles
asunder, and were separated hy a range of hills, over winich

passed three main roads. Various circumstances led
general Putnam to suspect that the enemy intended to
approach him by the road leading to his right, which he
therefore guarded with most care.
25. Very early in the morning of the 26th, his suspicions
were strengtlhened by the approach, upon that road, of a
column of British troops arnd upon the centre road, of a
column of Hessians. To oppose these, the American
troops were mostly drawn from their camp, and in the engagements which took place, evinced considerable bravery.
26. Trhese movements of the enemy were but feints to
divert the attention of Putnam from the road which led to
his left, along which general Clinton was silently advancing
with the main body of the British army. The reportof
cannon in that direction gave the first intimation of the
danger which was approaching. The Americans endeavored
to escape it, by returning, with the utmost celerity, to their
camp. They were not able to arrive there in timne, but
were intercepted by general Clinton, who drove them back
upon the Hessians.
27. Attacked thus in front and rear, they fought a succession of skirmishes, in the coulrse of which many were
killed, many made prisoners, andl several parties, seizing
favorable opportunities, forced their way through the
enemy, and regained the camp. A bold and vigorous
charge, made by the American general, lord Sterling, at
the head of a Maryland regiment, enabled a large body to
escape in this manner. This regiment, fighting with desperate bravery, kept a force greatly superior engaged, until
their comrades had passed by, when the few who survived,
ceasing to resist, surrendered to the enemy.
28. The loss of the Americans, in killed, wounded, and
prisoners, considerably exceeded a thousand. Among the
latter were generals Sullivan, Sterling, and Woodhull.
The total loss of the enemy was less than four hundred.
They encamped at night before the American lines; and
the next day began to erect batteries within six hundied(
yards of their left.
29. While the battle was raging, general Washington
passed over to Brooklyn, where he witnessed, with inex.
pressible anguish, the destruction of his best troops, from
which, such was the superiority of the enemy, it was
impossible to save them. Finding the men dispirited by
defeat, he determined to remove themr to the city. The
retreat was effected, on the night of the 2Sth, with such175
1776.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
silence and despatch, that before the suspicions of the
enemy were excited, the last divisionof boats was beyond
the reach of their fire.
30. So disheartened were the militia, that they deserted
by companies; and even the regular troops were infected
by their example. Near the middle of Septemnber, the
commander-in-chief, fearing to be enclosed in the city, retired to the heights of Haerlem. The enemy immediately
took possession. A few days afterwards, a fire broke olit
which consumed about a thousand hlouses.
31. General Washington, after reflecting upon the
events which had already occurred; after considering the
inexperience of his troops, the conldition of the country,
and the distance of the enemy from their resources, determnined to adopt a cautious system of warfare; to risk at
present no general engagement; to harrass and wear out
the enemy by keeping them in continual motion; and to
nspire his own troops with courage, by engagilg them in
Akirrmisiles, in all cases where success was probable. in,one, fought on the 6th of September, the brave colonel
Knowlton was killed; hut the result was so decidedly
tavorable to thie Americans, that the troops recovered
thieir spirits; and the general was confirmed in the system
he had adopted.
3'2. The movements of the enemy, in the beginning of
October, indicated an intention of gaining the rear of the
Americans, and cutting off their communication with tlhe
eastern states. The army, therefore, quitting Haerlem,
moved nJorthward towards'White Plains. General Howe
pursued, making several attempts to bring on a general
engagement, which Washington avoided by skilful changes
of position. A partial action was fought, on the 28th of
()ctober, in which the loss on both sides was nearly
e qial.
33. Finding his antagonist too cautious to be drawn into
tle open field, and too strong to be attacked in his entrenchments, general Howe determined to return towards
New-York, and attack forts Washington and Lee, situated
opposite to each other on the banks of the Hudson, and
about ten miles above the city. In these forts, garrisons
had been left, from a wish to preserve the command of this
important river. That in fort Washington, consisting in
part of militia, amounted to two thousand seven hunrdred
men, under colonel Magaw.
34. On the 16th of Nove,nber, four divisions of the176       tREVOLUTIONARY WARI                   [1776.
enemy's army, led by their principal officers, attacked it in
four different quarters. The garrison, and particularly the
riflemen under colonel Rawlings, fought bravely..The
Germans were several times driven back, with gremt loss.
But these combined and vigorous attacks were at length
successful. Thp ammunition in the fort being nearly ex
hausteds aid all the out posts driven in, the co-nmmander,
on being a second timre summonedf agreed to capitulate, o)n
honorable terms. This was the severest blow the Americans had yet felt. The loss of the enemy, however, in
killed and wounded, was supposed to be twelve hundred
men.
35. Fort ILee was immediately evactated, f.be garrison
joining general Wasltington. He had previously, with one
division of his army, crossed over into New-Jersey, leaving the other, under the comnmand of general Lee, in NewYork. his force, even when augmented by the garrison,
consisted of but three thousand effective men, and they
were destitute of tents, of blankets anId even of utensils
to cook their provisions. His first station was Newark
but the enemy pursuing himn, he was compelled to retreat
successively to Brunswick, to Princeton, to Trenton, and
finally to cross the Delaware into Pennsylvania; and so
3lose was the pursutit, that the advance of thle British army
wtas often in sight.
36. Small as was his force when the retreat began, it
diminished daily. On the last (if November, many of his
troops were entitl- to their discharge, and not one of
them could be pers laded to continue anothler d(lay in service. Such he feared would be the conduct of the remnainder, whose time would expire at the end of the year.
In this extremity, he urged general Lee to hasten to his
assistance; but that officer, having other purposes in view,
delayed his march. He called on the militia of NewJersey and Pennsylvania, but none obeyed his call. TIhe
population around him were hostile or desponding, andl.withheld all aid from an army whose career seemed near
its termination.
37. In this darkest hour in American history, general
Howe issued a proclamation offering pardon to all who
would declare their submission to royal authority. The
contrast between a raggedL, suffering, retreating army, and
a full-clad, powerftil, exulting foe, induced many, despairing of success, to abandon the cause they had espoused,
and accept of ptardon. Among them were Mr. Galloway,1776.1      REVOLUTIONARY WAR.                    177
and Mr. Allen, who had been members of the continental
congress.
38. As the British army approached Philadelphia, congress adjourned to Baltimore, having previously invested
general Washington with "full power to order and direct
all things relative to the department, and to the operations
of war." Such unlimited authority could not have been
placed in hands more worthy to hold it. To the elastic
energy of his mind, and his perfect self-possession in the
most desperate circumstances, is America, in a great degree, indeSbted for her independence.
39. On the day that he was driven over the Delaware,
the British took possession of Rhode Island. On the 13th
of December, general Lee, having wandered from his
army, was surprised and taken prisoner. In the experience and talents of this officer, the people reposed great
conifidence, and they lamented his loss like that of an
army. In its consequences, his capture was fortunate. The
command of his division devolved upon general Sullivan,
who conducted it promptly to general Washington, aug.
menting his army to nearly seven thousand effective men.
40. Still so much stronger were the enemy, that they
regarded the rebels, for so threy delighlted to call the
patriots of that day, as almost subdued, and doubted not
that a vigorous attempt, whenever they should be disposed
to maklie it, would place in their power the handful of men
before them. They rioted upon the plunder of the country, and enjoyed in prospect the fruits of an assured and
decisive victory.
41. Washington saw that this tide of ill fortune must
be stemmed--must even be rolled back upon the enemyor it would soon overwhelm his country. He resolved to
hazard all that was left in one vigorous effort for victory.
On the night of the 25th December, at the head of two
thousand four hundred men, he crossed the Delaware at
Trenton, surprised a body of Hessians stationed at that
place, took nine hundred prisoners, and immediately recrossed, h'aving lost but iiine of his men.
42. This sudden and severe blow awakened the enemy
to activity. Cornwallis, who had repaired to New-York,
intrusting to his inferior officers the task of finishing the
war, returned, with additional troops, to regain the ground
that had been lost. He concentrated his forces at Princeton; and soon after, Washington, having been joined by
a body of Pennsylvania militia, and persuaded the NewM17-    REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
England troops to serve six wveeks longer, again crossed
the Delaware and took post at Trenton.
43. On the 2d of January, 1777, the greater part of the
British army marched to attack 1e Americans. In the
evening they encamped near Trenton, in full, expectation
of a battle and victory in the morning. Washington,
sensible of the inferiority of his force; sensible too that
flight would be almost as fatal as defeat, conceived another
bold project which he resolved instantly to execute.
44. About midnight, having renewed his fires, he silent.

of the enemy, marched towards Princeton, where he presumed Cornwallis had left a part of his troops. At sun.
rise, the van of the American forces met unexpectedly
two British regiments. A sharp action ensued; the former gave way. At this crisis, when all was at stake, the
commander-in!-chief led the main body to the attackl. The
enemy, were routed aid fled. Fortunately the heroic
Washington, though exposed to both fires, and but a few
yards distant from either party, escaped unhurt.
45. Instead of pursuing them, he pressed forward to
Princeton, where ore regiment yet remained. Part saved
themselves by a precipitate flight; about three hundred
were nade prisoners. The British loss in killed was upwards of one hundred; the American was less, but in the
number were the brave general Mercer, and several valuable officers. Among the wounded was lieutenant J.ames
Monroe, afterwards raised to the highest office in the gift
of his fellow citizens.
46. In consternation, the British army immediately evacuated Trenton, and retreated to New-Brunswick. The
inhabitants, resuming their courage, and giving full force
to their rage, which fear had smothered, took revenge for
the brutalities they had suffered. The enemy were driveni'
from all their posts in New.Jersey, except Amboy and
Brunswick, and the Amrerican army obtainedl sepure winter quarters at Morristown.
47. The brilliant victories at TI'renton dPrinceton
raised, from the lowest depression, the spirits of the
American people. They regarded Washington as the savior of his country. He becamne the theme of eulogy
throughout Europe. And having displayed, as occasions
demnanded, the opposite qualities of caution and impetuosity, he received the honorable and appropriate appellation
of the American Fabius.
[1777oCHAPTER XIX.
CAMPAIGN OF 1777.
THS firmness manifested by congress, when disastez
and defeat had almost annihilated the American army,
entitles the members to the gratitude and admiration of
every friend of freedom. They exhibifed no symptom
of terror or dismay. They voted to raise an army to take
the plpce of that which was to be disbanded at the end of
the year; and, made sensible by experience, that short
enlistments had been the cause of most of the misfortunes
of their country, they resolved that the new levies should
be enlisted to serve three years or during the war, at the
option of the individual recruits. To defray expenses,
they made large emissions of paper money. And to evince
their firm determination to the world, they solemnly
declared that they would listen to no terms of peace
which required a relinquishment of their independence,
or which should deprive other nations of a free trade to
their ports.
2. Relying on the inveterate enmity of France against
Great Britain, they sent commissioners to that court,
with instructions to solicit a loan of money, a supply of
munitions of war, and an acknowledgement of the independence of the United States. These commissioners
were Dr.Franklin, Silas Dean, and Arthur Lee. Frank.

and even in the ports of France, of the prizes taken by
American privateers. The value of these prizes made in
the year 1776, was computed at five millions of dollars,
and far exceeded that of the captures made by the enemy.
4. So popular was the cause of the United States, and
so exalted the character of their military leader, that
many French officers solbght anl opportunity of engaging
M2of the fort, when, to avoid the danger of beinrg sunk, they
hastened back to their companions.
16. Sustaiiing now a high reputation among the Indians,

which preserved the colony fioin famine. The princess
Pocahontas also, remembering him whose life she had
saved, frequeutly sent him siuch articles as were-most
needed.'rhe settlers were thuis enabled to subsist until
captain Newport, wno had returned to England, again arrived at Jamestown, with a quantity of provisions, and one
hunidred and twenty persons who came to reside in the
colony.
17. All danger being in appearance over, the emigrants
no longer submitted to the authority, nor listened to the
advice of Smith. Disorder and conftusion followed; and
about this timie, that raging passion ibfor gold, which first
impelled Europeans to resort to this country, was againexcited. In a stream nortlh of Jamestown, a glittering
earth was discovered which was supposed to be gold dust.
"Immediately," says Stith, in his history, " there was no
thought, no discouLrse, no hope, and no work, but to dig
gold, wash gold, refine gold, and load gold." And notwithstanding the remonstrances of Smiith, a ship was freighted
with this worthless cotmmodity al(id sent to Englanid.
18. Finding he could not be useiful in Jamestown, a,nd
unwilling to be idle, Smith set out uponi an expedition to
explore the coasts of the Chesapeake. With great labor
anid fatigue, he examined every inlet, river, and bay, as far
as the mouth of thle Rappahannock; wlhence, his provi.
sions being exhausted, he returnied home.

in their service. Among these, the young Marquis de la
Fayette was most conspicuous for his rank, and most distinguished for his ardor and enthutsiasm. At an early
period, he communicated to the American agents his wish
to join the republican armies. At first, they encouraged
his zeal, but learning the disasters which preceeded the
victory at Trenton, they, with honorable frankness, communicated the inbrmation to him, and added that they
were so destitute of funds, that they could not even provide for his passage across the ocean.
5. "If your country," replied the gallant youth, "is indeed reduced to this extremity, it is at this moment that
mny departure to join her armies will render her the most
edsential service."  He immediately hired a vessel to
convey him to America, where he arrived in the spring of
1777. He was received with cordial affection by the
people, became the bosom friend of Washington, solicited
permission to serve withlout pay, and was appointed
mnajor-general in the armny.
6. In the last campaign, more pr[soners had been taken
by the Britishl than by the Amnericans. They were de}rained at New-York, and were confined in churches and
prison ships, where they endured the extremity of wretchedness.. They were exposed, without fire and almost
*without clothes, to the inclemency of a severe winter
Awere often whole days without bfod, and when food was,offered, it was but a miserable pittance, daniaged and
loathsome.. Many died of hunger, and more of diseases,
produced by their complicated sufferings.
7. WVashington remonstrated with warmth, and threat,ened retaliation. After his victories in New-Jersey,
their treatment was less inhuman. An exchange was
agreed upon, but many,-;when.:atteimpting to walk from
their places.of confiriement to the vessels provided to
convey them away, fell and expired in the streets. Yet
in the midst of these unparalleled sufferings, they had
exhibited fortitude more rare, and more honorable to
human nature, than the highest display of val6i in battle.
To entice them to enlist in the royal army, they were promised relief frommisery, and the enjoyment of abundance.
They rejected the offer with disdain; thus giving to the
world tae noblest proof of the absence of all mercenary
motive, and of the since'rity and fervor of their devotion;o their country.
$, N~ar thte end of May, the Amierican arliy, wichdll

had been augmented by recruits to almost ten thousand
men, moved from Morristown, and took a strong position
at Middlebrook. The British, soon after, left their encampment, and general Howe endeavored, by various
movements, to induce general Washington to quit his
strong hold and meet him on equal groind. BuLt the latter,
adhering to his Fabian system of warfaro. determined to
remain in the position he had chosen.
9. General Howe, changing his purpose, transported his
army to Staten Island.  He there embarked sixteen
thousand troops on board a large fleet, and, leaving Sir
Henry Clinton in command at New-York, put out to se l
on the 26th of July. His destination was carefully kept
secret. On the 2O0th of August, the fleet entered Chesaeake bay, and rendered it certain that an attack uponI
Philadelphlia was intended. Th'ie troops were landed at
Elk ferry, in Maryland, fifty miles south of that city.
10. The Amnierican army immediately crossed the Delaware, and, passing through Philadelphia, directed its march
towards the enemy. The people, weary of delays an(d
indecisive movements, demanded that a general engagement should be hazarded for the defence of the metropolis.
Washington, yielding to their wishes, took a position on
the eastern bank of Brandywine creek, and in the direction
of the enemy's route.
11. On the eleventh of September, the British army
appeared, and, crossing the creek at several fords, commenced an attack upon the American right, which, after
a short resistance, gave way. The other divisions, successively attacked, gave way in like manner, and the rout
becoming general, a retreat -was ordered to Chester.
12. Several portions of the American army, particularly
a brigade from Virginia, exhibited in this battle groat
firmness and bravery. The misconduct of others rendered
their bravery unavailing. The American loss amounted
t.) twelve hundred; the British to no more than half that
number.  The Marquis de la Fayette took part in the
engagement and was wounded. The next day, the army
retired to Philadelphia, and soon after to Reading, where
a quantity of stores had been deposited. The retreat was
performed without a murmur, although many marched
without'shoes, and slept on the ground without blankets.
On the 26th of September, general Howe entered Philadelphia in triumph, congress having previously removed
to Lancaster.

13. The transactions of the contending armies at the
the north, since the termination of the expedition to
Canada, now demand our attention.  The Americans
hasted at Crown Point, the British at St. Johns, and both
employed the remainder of the summer in building vessels
and making preparations to secure'the command of Lake
Champlain.
14. On the 11th of October, 1776, the American and
British squadrons met, colonel Arnold, who had been a
sailor in his youth, commanding the former. After a short
contest, the enemy, not being then able to bring their whole
force into action, retired. The next day, they returned to
the combat, and being greatly superior, drove the American
squadron before them, to the head of the lake. A sharp
action then took place;' the officers and men. fought
gallantly, but Arnold losing a part of his force, and perceiving defeat to be inevitable, ran the remainder of his
vessels on shore and set them on fire.
15. Winter approaching, governor Carleton returned
with his troops to Canada. General Burgoyne, who had
served under him during the last campaign, made a voyage
to England to concert a plan for future operations. It was
determined that a powerful army, departing from Montreal,
should proceed, by way of Lake Champlain, to the Hudson,
with the view of obtaining, by the co-operation of the
army at New-York, the entire command of that river.
All communication between the states of New-England,
and the others lying south of them, would thus be prevented. Either section, alone and unsupported, could, it
was supposed, be easily subdued; and the whole strength
of the nation might then be directed against the other.
16. Nothlingwas omitted which,might insure the success
of this project. Seven thousand choice troops, to be sent
from England, were allotted to the service. They were
supplied with an excellent train of brass artillery, and with
every thing which could add to their efficiency as an army.
The command was given to Burgoyne, and several officers of
distinguished reputation were selected to serve under him.
17. General Schuyler, of New-York, a worthy officer,
whose talents were solid but not brilliant, had the chief
command of the northern department. He was indefatigable in making preparations for defence; and such was his
zeal in the cause of independence, and such his deserved
popularity in his nativ e state, that lie doubtless accomplished more thlan any other person could have done.
[1776.183
1 777.1  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
Still, at a late period in the spring, the fortifications were
incomplete* and but few troops or munitions of war were
collected.
18. Very early in the season. Burgoyne arrived at Quebec   l He immediately despatched colonel St. Leger with
a party of regulars torie,s, and Indians, by the way of the
St. Lawrence to Oswego, directing him to proceed thence
to the Mohawki and join him at Albany. With the main

against so powerful a force. It was evacuated in the night
of the 5th, the troops crossing Lake Chumplain and re
treating towards Castleton, in ermont  The enemy pur~
sued, and on the morning of the 7th, their van overtook
and attacked the American rears under colonels Francis
and Warner. The action was warm and well contested,
but other troops arriving to the aid of the British, the.mericans were compelled to give way.
20. The retreat now became precipitate and disoderly,
the pursuit rapid and persevering. At length, the republi'
carl army, diminished in number, exhausted by fatigue, and
dispirited by mnisfortunes, arrived, by various routes, at
fort Edwardj on the 1:udson, the head-quarters of general
Schuyler. lThese disastrous events spread terror and
dismay throughotu the land.  The people, ignorant of the
weakness of the army, attributed its retreat to cowardioe
or treachery, and trembled at the dangers which menmaed
them from the British, Germans, and savages.
21. T'rhe royal forces, elated iy success, proceeded
through the wilderness towards fort Edwardl.  their
progress was slow and toilsome. General Scheyler, on
their approach, evacuated the fort, and retired across the
Huidson to Saratoga. Soon after, he deseemded the river
to Stillwater; and, the British continuing to advance, he
retreated, on the 14th of Augtust, to the islands at the
confltence of the Mohawk and Hudson, a few miles north
of Troy. About the same time, intelligence was received,
that St. Leger, having penetrated from Oswego to the
Mohawk, hiaa laid giege-to fort Schuyler, situated in the
present township of Rome.
M 4REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
22. The American general, before leaving fort Edward
issued proclamation calling to his aid the militia of NewEngland and New-York. Aroused by the danger multi,
tudes obeyed his call. Vermont poured forth her daring
Green-Mountain boys; the other states of New-England
their hardy yeoman.y, ardent in the cautse of freedom;
New-York, her valiant sons, indignant at this invasion of
her territory, and determined to protect their property from
pillage and destruction.  These beset the invaders on
every side, impeding their progress, cutting off their supplies, and tiatiguing them by incessant attacks.
23. Burgoyne, finding it difficult to transport his provisions tl'rough the wilderness, despatched colonel Baum,
with five hundred Hessians, to seize a quantity of beef
and flour which the Amnericans had collected and deposited
at Bennington. Fortunately, general Stark, at the head
of a party of New-Hampshire militia, had just arrived at
that place, on his way to the main army, and been joined
by volunteers from the immediate neighlbourhood. Baum,
ascertaining their number to be greater than his own,
halted near Bennington, erected breastworks, and sent
back for a reinforcement.
24. In several skirmishes between small detachments,
the militia were uniformly successful. This sharpening
their courage, Stark resolved to attack the main body.
On the 16th of August, a fierce and sanguinary battle took
place. For two hours, the Hessians fought bravely, hut
their works, assaulted by braver tPiops, were at length
entered, and most of the detachment either killed or made
prisoners.    
25. Just after thls action had terminated, colonel Brevman arrived with the reinforcement sent to Baum. T'he
mnilitia, apprehending no danger, had dispersed in pursuit
of plunder or the fugitives. By carelessness was nearly
lost all that by valor had been gained. Happily, at this
critical juncture, colonel Warner arrived from Manchester
with a continental regiment, and immediately fell upon
Breyman, The militia, rallying, hastened to his aid. The
battle continued until sunset, when the enemy retreated,
and under cover of the night the greater part effected their
escape..26. The tide of fortune was now turned. The decisive
victory at Bennington diffused confidence and joy. The
friends of independelce; before depressed by disaster and
defeat, were now animated by the prospect, which sudi184
[1777185
REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
denly burst upon them, of a glorious victory over an arrogant and once dreaded enemny. The greatest zeal and
activity were every where displayed. Again crowds of
militia flocked to thile republican camp.
27. In a few days, cheering intelligence arrived from fort
Schuyler. The garrison under colonels Gansevoort and
Willet, had, in the midst of the most discouraging circumstances, mnade a gallant defence against the forces of St.
Leger. General Herkimer, marching with eight hundred
militia to their relief, fell into an ambuscade, was defeated
and slain; but a larger party was speedily collected and
immediately despatched, under general Arnold, upon the
same service.
28. The Indians, alarmed by their approach, and fatigued and disgusted by the protracted labors of the siege,
threatened to abandon St. Leger, if he would not reliquish
his enterprise. He reluctantly consented, and with the
loss of his baggage and stores retreated to Montreal.
Burgoyne was thus deprived of his expected co-operation,
and the militia of that part of the states were enabled to
join the American army.
29. The disasters which befell this army at the commencement of the campaign induced congress to recall the
generals who commanded it, and to appoint, in their places,
generals Gates, Lincoln, and Arnold. Having the control
of more abundant and powerful means, they acted with
more energy and boldness. Gates, leaving the encampment on the islands, to which Schuyler had retreated,
advanced, in the beginning of September, to the nreighborhood of Stillwater.
30. Burgoyne, after the defeat of Baum, was obliged to
have recourse, for provisions, to the magazines at fort
George. The laborious task of transporting them through
the wilderness to the Hudson being accomplished, he
moved forward, and on the 17th of September, encamped
within four miles of the American army.
31. The next day, the first battle of Stillwater was
fought. It was begun by skirmishes between the scouting
parties of the two armies, which were respectively and
repeatedly reintorced, until nearly the whole of each was
engaged. Both fought with determined resolution; they
alternately drove and were driven by each other. A con
tinual blaze of fire was kept up. Men, and particularly
officers, dropped every moment and on every side. Night
put an end to the conflict.  
Q 2
1777.]-18fl  REVOLtJIONARY WAR.
32. The American armrhy retired to their camp; the
British lay on their arms near the field of battle. The
loss of the former was three hundred and nineteen; that
of the latter exceeded five hundred. Each claimed the
victory; the consequences of defeat were felt by -the
British alone. Their hopes of success were diminished,
their Indian allies, the Canadians, and tories, were disheartened and deserted them.
33. Pressed on all sides, Burgoyne made frequent and
urgent applications to Sir Henry Clinton, at New-York,
for aid, and informed him that, in expectation, of such aid,
he would maintain his --present position until the I'2th of
October. He diminished the allowance of provisions to
his soldiers, and having waited until the 7th, without receiving any intelligence from Clinton, determined to make
another trial of strength with his adve'sary.
34. He made dispositions to commence the action with
the right wing of his army; Gates, discovering his design,
made a sudden and vigorous attack upon the left. In a
short time, the whole of both armies weie engaged. This
battle was furious, obstinate, and more bloody than the
other. Arnold was eminently distinguished for his bravery
and rashness. Towards night, the enemy, who had fboght
with desperate valor, gave way. A part of their works
were stormed and taken, and more than two hundred men
made prisoners.
35. Darknoss put an end to this action also. The
Americans lay upon their arms near the enemy's lines, intending to renew the battle the next day; but Burgoyne,
during the night, withdrew to a stronger position. Gates
forbore to pursue, believing that a bloodless victory was
now in his power.
36. In the mean time, Sir Henry Clinton despatched
general Vaughan with three thousand men, to endeavor to
relieve Burgoyne. He ascended the Hudson, and on the
sixth of October, assaulted and took fort Montgomery;
but instead of hastening forward, he consuLmed a whole
week in pillaging and burning Esopus, and other flourishing villages on the river. He perhaps expected that this
wanton destruction of property would draw off a part of
the forces under Gates; but it had no other effect than to
exasperate the inhabitant,.
37. Burgoyne, perceiv',it his antagonist was endeavoring to surround him, retreated to the heights of
Saratoga. The Americans pursued, keeping a sul;ti;cint
[1777.187
1777,]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
force on the east bank of the river to prevent him from
crossing. The situation of the British troops was now
distressing in the extreme. Maniy of their nmost valied
officers had been killed. Their strength was exhausted
by incessant exertion; they were almost encircled by
their enemy, and were greatly annoyed by a continual and
destructive cannonade. From this forlorn condition but
one mode of escape remained, a forced march in the night;o fort George. This expedient was resolved on, and preparations were made; but the scouts sent out returned
with intelligence that all the passes were guarded by
strong bodies of militia.
38. An account of piovisions was then taken, and a
supply for no more than three days was found on haniid. No
hope of rescue within that time could be indulged. Burgoyne summoned his principal officers to a council. It is
said that while deliberating, a cannon ball crossed the
table around which they sat. By their unanimous advice,
he opened a negotiation with the American general, and on
the 17th of October, surrendered his whole army prisoners
of war.
39. Great were the rejoicings occasioned by this glorious
victory. Many supposed that it would terminate'the contest. In the joy of success, all feelings of resentment
were forgotten. From regard to the feelings of the vanquisled, general Gates, while they were piling their arms,
kept the victorious troops within his camp. The British
officers, in social converse with the Americans, were led
to forget their misfortune, and the troops, when on their
march to Massachusetts, did not receive from the people
that vindictive treatment which their distressicng depredations, and those of tileir fellow soldiers under Vaughan,
would have excused, if not justified.
40. Against this band of marauders, general Gates
marched soon after the capitulation was sighed; but on
learning the fate of Burgoyne, they retired to New-York.
About the same, time, the garrison left at Ticonderoga,
having rendered their cannon useless, returned to Canada,
and the northern department was restored to perfect tranquility.
41. While the exertions of the northern army were rewarded by brilliant success, that of the south, e(rually
brave and meritorious, but enfeebled by the detachments
which Washington generously spared to Gates, sustained
distressing reverses. The gre atest was at Germ-fantown,188    REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
in the vicinity of Philadelphia, where the main body of the
enemy was slationed.
42. IUpon this body, at sunrise, on the 4th of October,
the American general made a bold and vigorous attack. So
sudden and spirited was the onset,'that the enemy, unable
to sustain it, fled, and a complete victory appeared in prospect. But six British companies, while retreating, threw
themselves into a large stone house, from which, in entire
safety, they poured a destructive fire upon the American
troops. The pursuit was arrested, and much time consumed in a vain attempt to demolish this fortress.
43. The fugitives rallied, and turned upon the assailants.
Confusion followed, and a thick fog, which that momnent
arose, increased it. The different divisions, ignorant of
the positions and success of the others, uncertain even as
to their own, acted with indecision and timidity. A retreat
was therefore directed. and the troops withdrew in good
order.
44. In this action, in which fortune snatched victory
from the grasp of the Americans, they sustained a loss of
twelve hundred men; that of the British was less than six
hundred. But the vanquished sustained no loss of reputation nor confidence. Their country applauded the boldness of the attempt, and the enemy felt higher respect for
their courage and discipline.
45. Thlle British army soon after left Germantown, and
marched to attack the American posts on the river Delaware below Philadelphia. On the 22d of October, a body
of twelve hundred Hessians, commanded by count Donop,
made an intrepid assault upon the fortifications at Red
Bank. They were repulsed with great loss, and their
gallant leader kcilled.
46. Fort Mifflin, on Mutd Island, was next attacked.
For six days it was bravely defended. It was then evacuated, the works having been almost demolished by tle
enemy's artillery. Preparations being made frox a second
assault, with a much larger force, upon the post at Re(l
Bank, that was also evacuated, and thus was opened a free
communlication l)cbetween the British armny and their fleet,
which had sailed round to the mouth of the Delaware.
47. After several movements of thie respective armies.
which had no imiportant result, general Washington withdrew to winter quarters in the woods of Valley Forge.
His troops were destitute of shoes, and might have
been tracked by the blood of their feet. They passed the

winter in huts, suffered extreme distress from want of
clothing and of food, but endured their privations without
a murmur. How strong must have been their love of
liberty  With what lively gratitude ought a prosperous
country, indebted to them for the most valuable blessings,
to remember their sufferings and services.
CHAPTER XX.
CAMPAIGN OF 1778.
WIIaE the American armies were contending in the
field, or suffering in the camp, congress were occupied in
title performance of duties important to the cause of independence. At first, this body possessed no powers, but
such as were conferred by the credentials and instructions
given, by the state legislatures, to their respective delegates. Early in 1776, a confederation of the states was
proposed; but until the 15th of November, 1777, all the
olbstacles to the measure could not be surmounted.
2. The "Articles of Confederation" then adopted by
Congress, and subsequently ratified by the several assemblies, bound the states in a firfn league of friendship with
each other, for their common defence and the security of
their liberties. Delegates were to be annually appointed,
who, when assembled in congress, were authorized to
carry on war, to make peace, and to exercise the powers
of sovereignty in relation to foreign nations. They were
also authorized to detern.ine the number of men, and the
amount of money to be raised, and to assign to each state
its just proportion.
3. But so unwilling were the states to relinquish their
recently assumed independence, that they withheld from
congress the authority to make laws which should operate
directly upon the people; and reserved to themselves the:
sole right of raising their proportions of money in such
manner as each might deem most expedient.
4. Congress also effected a thorough reform of the commissary department, in which scandalous frauds had been
committed. And in order to introduce a uniform system
of tactics and discipline, they resolved that an inspectorgeneral should be appointed. Subsequently they elected
to that office the baron Steuben, a native of Prussia, who
189VIRGINIA.'
wish, he consented to accept the office. Under his administration, habits of industry and subordination were
formed, and peace and plenty smiled uponi the colony.
21. In 1609, the London Company, having obtained a
new charter, conferring greater powers and privileges than
the former, despatched to Virginia nine ships, carrying five
hundred emigrants, and certain officers appointed to supersede the existing government. The ship, in which
these officers embarked, was driven ashore on the island
of Bermudas. The settlers, who camne in the others, were
licentious, profligate, and disorderly. Assuming the power
of disposing of the government, they conferred it some
times on one, and sometimes on another.
22. In this confusion, Smith hesitated but a short time
in deciding what course to pursue. He determined that
his authiority was not suspended until the ariival of the
persons appointed to supersede him, and resumed, with a
strong hand, the reins of government. He boldly imprisoned the leaders of the sedition, and restored for a
time regularity and obedience.
23. Tihe Indians, jealous of the increasing power of the
strangers who had invaded their country, concerted a plot
to destroy them. Pocahontas, the constant friend of Vir.
ginia, hastened, in a dark and dreary iiight, to Jamestown9
and informed Smith of his danger. Measures of precau.
tion were instantly taken. The Indians, perceiving that
their design was discovered, again brought presents of
peace to the English.
24. Soon after, Smith, having received by accident a se.
vere wound, returned to England to procure the aid of a
surgeon. Disastrous consequences followed., The In.
dians, learnitig that the man whom they dreaded most had
left the coloniy, attacked it with united forces. A dread.
ful famine ensued.''To such extremity were the settlers
reduceed, that they devoured the skins of the horses, th~
bodies of the Indians whom they had killed, and at last
those of their own comrpanions, who hlad sunk under accumulated miseries. These tremendous sufferings were recollected long afterwards with horror, and the period was
remembered and distinguished by the name of the "S TARVo
ING TIME."
25. In six months, the colony, from five hundred per.
solns, was reduced to sixty; and these were exceedingly
dejected. In this situation theywere visited by those who
wele shipwreciked at Bormi(las. All immnediately deter.

had served in a high station in the army of Frederic the
great, and was well versed in the system of manceuvres
introduced by that celebrated commander.
5. The signal victory at Saratoga exalted the reputation
of the confederated states, in every part of Europe. The
French ministry no longer hesitated to acknowledge their
independence. On the 6th of February, they concluded,
with the American commissioners, treaties of commerce
and of alliance, in which they generously assented to
terms highly advantageous to the states. This event, so
flattering to the hopes and the pride'of the people, occasioned the liveliest joy, and the most ardent gratitude to
France.
6. Among the people of Great Britain, the defeat of
their favorite general produced astonrishment, dismay, and
indignation. The most brilliant success was anticipated;
the most ignomrinious results had occurred. The pride of
the nation was humbled, and they who had disapproved of
the war, poured upon the ministry a torrent 6f invective.
To increase the bitterness of their chagrinl, they soonII
learned the course-which their hereditary enemy and rival
had resolved to pursue.
7. It was now determined in the cabinet, to grant to
America all that she had demanded, in the beginning of the
contest. An act was passed, declaring that parliament
would not, in future, impose any tax upon the colonies;
and commissioners were sent over, authorized to pioclaim
a repeal of a4l the offensive statutes, and to treat with the
constituted authorities of America.
8. The commissioners, arriving at Philadelphia in the
spring, communicated to congress the terms offered by
Great Britain, which were at once unanimously rejected
Failing in the use cf direct and honorable means, they
attempted bribery and corruption.'To Joseph Reed, a
general in the army anid a member of congress, an offer
was made of ten thousand pounds sterling, and any office
within his majesty's gift in the colonies, if he would endeavor to effect a reunion of the two countries, "I amn
not worth purchasing," he nobly replied, "but such as I
am, the kinrg of Great Britain is'not rich enough to do it."
9. On receiving official notification of the treaties concluded witht her revolted colonies, Great Britain declared
war against France; and the ministry, presuming that
assistance would be sent them, transmitted- orders,by the
commissioners, that Philadelphia should be evacuated,
[1778e1778.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
and the royal troops concentrated at New-York. The
execution of these orders devolved upon Sir Henry Clinton,
who, general Howe having resignred, had been appointed
commander-in-chief. On the 18th of June, the enemy
quitted the city, and marched slowly eastward.
10. Washington, leaving his huts in the forest, hung
upon the rear of the British army, watching fbr a favorable
opportunity to offer battle. On arriving at Monmouth, in
New-Jersey, general Lee, who had lately been exchanged,
was ordered to take the command of five thousand men,
and, early in the mornling of tle 28th, unless there should
be powerful reasons to the contraryf to commence an attack. He was assured, that the residue of the army
should follow and give hin support.
-11. Leome made dispositions to attack according(rly, but
perceiving tlhe main body of the enemy returning to meet
him, he retreated.  WVashington, advancing to render the
promrised support, saw him retiring, rode forward and
addressed him in language implying disapprobation of his
conl,duct. He theii directed himn to form his men, on
ground which he pointed out, and there oppose the progress of the enemy.
12. These orders were executed with firmness. A
warmn engagement ensued, and Lee, when forced from the
grouind, brought otr his troops in good order, Washington,
at this momnent, arrived with the main body of his army,
iwhich joined in the action, and compelled the enemy to
fall back to the position from which Lee had been driven.
13. The day had been intensely hot; it was now almost
dark, and the troops were much fatigued. Further operations were therefore deferred until the next morning. In
the night, Sir Henry Clinton silently left his position, and
continued his march to New-York. His loss amounted to
near five hulndred men,; that of the Americans to three
hundred. -Heat and excessive fatigue proved fatal to
many.
14. Lee, irritable and proud, could not forget the manner
in which Washington had addressed him; and in two
passionate letters, demanded reparation. A court martial
was instituted; lhe was found guilty of misconduct on-the
day of battle, and of disrespect to the commander-in-chief,
and wvas.suspeiided from command for one year. He never
afterwards joined the army, but died in seclusion j ust before the close of the war.
15. The enemy having entered New-Yorkl, Washington

conduoted his army to White Plains. Congress returned
to Philidelphia; and in July received, with inexpressible
v,y, a letter from the count d' Estaing, announcing his
arrival on the coast of the United States, with a large
fleet, which had been sent, by the king of France, to assist
them in their struggle for independence.
16. The count intended to surprise admiral Howe in
the Delaware, but adverse winds detained him oni the
passage, until the British fleet had sailed for New-York.
He appeared before that harbor, but onl sounding fotiid
that his largest ships could inot euter it. A combined
attack, by land and water, upon the British forces at
Newport, in Rhode Island, was then projected.
17. General Sullivan, who had oeen appointed to conmand the troops, called upon the militia of New- lEngland
to aid hini in the enterprise. His army soon anoulited
to ten thousand men, and, as he was slpported by the
fleet, he-felt confident o' success. On the nint h of
August, he took a position on'the north end ef Rholde
Island, and afterwards moved nearer to: Newport. Admiiral Howe, having received a rein lbre(emient, now apl)peare(l
before the harbor, and the cotunt instantly put to sea to
attack him.                                   ts
18. While making the preparatory inanceuvres, a furious
storm caire on, which daniaged arid dispersed both fle-ts.
As soonI as the weather would permlit, each com-mandier
sought the port from which he' had sailed. The army,
intent upon their own object, witnessed with joy the
return of the French fleet; and great was their disappointmnient when the count annoutinced his intention of
proceeding to Boston to refit. Thle American officers
remonstrated, but he was inflexible and departed.
19. The army, deserted by the fleet, could renmain no
longer, with safety, on the island, as the enemy might
easily transport, by water, large reinforcements from NewYork to Newport.    General Sullivan immediately retreated to his first position. He was pursued, antd shortly
after halting, was attacked by the enemy. They were
gallantly resisted and repulsedlwith loss.
20. The next day, the two armnies cannonaded eachl
other, and the succeeding night the American general,
deceiving the enemny by a show of resistance to the
last, made a skilful retreat to the continent. A few hours
afterwards, the British received such an augmentation of
their force, that all resistance, on the part of tlhe Ameri[1778.'1778.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.'9
cans, would hiave been vain. At the cl'o se of the season,
UPs- French Ileet sailed to the West Indies.
21. Duringb this year, the British ttibops and th6r- allies
displayed, in several jinstancesi a degree 6f ba~ibarity seldom equalled in chuntests bet*eoui civilized nations. Thlat

conquests. At the close of the year, it was apparent that
Great Britain had mnade no progress in tile accomplishment
of her purposes.
CHAPTER XXI.
CAMPAIGN OF 1779.
THE campaign of 17.7,9, was distinguished by a change
of the theatre of war, from the northern to the southern
section of the confederacy.  Thither the enemy were
invited by the prospect of easier victory. The country
was rendered weak by its scattered population, by thle
multitude of slaves, and by the numiber of tories intermingled with the whigs.
2. Near the close of the preceding year, lieutenanitcolonel Canmpbell, with 2500 men, sailed froIn New-York
to the coast of Georgia, and landed his troops. Marching
towards Savanna-i, the capital, he met on his route a small
body of Americans, whom he defeated, and immediately
took possession of the city. A detachmnent from Florida
under general Prevost invested Sunbuiy, which, after the
fall of the capital, surrendered at discretion. These were
the only military posts in Georgia. All thle troops that
could escape retreated into South-Carolina.
3. Soon after the conquest of Georgia, general Lincoln
took command of the American troops in the southern
department. In April, leaving South-Carolina, he marched
into the interior of Georgia; upon which the British army,
eie- ring the state he had left, invested Charleston, the
capital. Lincoln hastened back to its defence. On hearino
of his approach, the enemy retired to Stono ferry. Thither
Lincoln pursued them. An indecisive action was fought;
and a few days afterwards, they continued their retreat to
Savannah.
4. The heat of the season suspended farther operations
until September. Count d'Estaing, with a fleet carrying
6000 troops, then arrived on the coast. The two armies,
in concert, laid siege to Savannah. At the expiration of
a month, the count, impatient of delay, insisted that the
siege should be abandoned, or that a combined assault
upon the enemy's works should immediately he made.
General Lincoln determined upon an assault.  Greatgallantry was displayed by thle Frenchl and American, but
greater by the British troops. T'rhey repulsed the assailants, killing and wounding nearly a thousand men, and
sustaining, onr their part, hbut little loss.  The count
Pulaski, a celebrated Polish noblemnan, in the service of
the states, was niortally wounded. T'rhe next day the
siege was raised, the Frenchi returning home, and the
Americans to South-Carolina.
5. In the midst of thl-ese events, general MAlatthews,
sailing from New-York, conducted an expedition against
Virginia. On the lOthl of Mlay, lie took posse,;sion of
Portsmouthl, without opposition, and ravaged, for two
weeks, that city a,id the adjacent country. The booty
obtained, and the property destroyed, were of immense
value. Before the'expiration of May, the party returned
to New-York.
6. Early in the season, colonel (Clarke, of Virginia, who
was stationed at Kaskaskia, on the Mississippi, achieved
an enterprise conslpicuous for boldness of l design, and
evincilor uncommon hardihood in its execution. With
only o(ne hundred and thirty mlen, hle penetrated throiugh
the wilderness, to bt. Vince.Its, a British post on the
X, abash, in the heart of the lndian country. His route
lay across deep swamlps au(l morasses. IFor four or five
miles the party waded througih water, often as highl as the
breast. After a march of sixteen (ldays, they reached the
town, which, having no intimlationi of' their a~proach, surrendered without resistance. A shlort time aftier, the fort
capitulated.  This fortunate achievement arrested an
expedition which the enemy had projected against the
frontiers of Virginia, and detached several tribes of Indians
from the British interest.
7. Tlhe atrocities committed at Wyoming, and at several settlements in New-York, cried aloud fo- vengeance.
Congress, assembling an army of 4000 men, gave the command of it to general Sutllivan, and directed him to conduct
it into the country inhabited by the savages, and retort
upon them their own system of warfare. Of this army,
one division marched from the Mohawk, the other fromn
Wyoming, and both forming a junction on the Susquehannah, proceeded, on the 22d of August, towards the
Seneca lake.
8. On an advantageous position, the Indians, in conjuinction with 200 tories, had erected fortifications to
oppose their progress. These were assaulted; the enemy

after a slight resistance, gave way, and disappeared in the
woods. As the army advanced into the western part of
the state of New-York, that region now so fertile and
populous, the Indians deserted their towns, the appearance
of which denoted a higher state of civilization than had
ever before been witnessed in the North American wilderness. The houses were commodious; the apple and
peach-trees numerous, and the crops of corn then growing
abundant.. All were destroyed; Inot a vestige of human
industry was permitted tc exist.
9. Having accomplished this work of vengeance, severe
but deserved, and essential to the fiture safety of the
whites, general Sullivan returned to Easton, in Pennsylvania, where he arrived about the middle of October.
His whole loss, by sickness and the enemy, amounted to
but forty men.
10. On the first of July, general Tryon sailed from NewYork with a large body of troops, and landing on the coast
of Connecticut, plundered New-Haven, and laid Fairfield
and Norwalk in ashes. Before his return, general Wayne,
with a detachment from the American army, made a daring
assault upon Stoney Point, a strongly fortified post on the
Hudson. About twelve at night, the troops, with unloadt:d
muskets, arrived before the lines. They were received
with a tremendous discharge of grape-shot and mrnusketry.
Rashing forward, they.mounted the walls, and using the
bayonet only, were soon in complete possessionll of the bfort.
11. A more gallant exploit has seldom been performed;
and the humanity of the victors was equal to their valor.
Notwithstanding the devastations in Connecticut, and the
b.utchery of Baylor's troop, the scene of which was near,
not an. individual suffered after resistance had ceas6d.
Of the enemy, sixty were killed, and upwards of five hundred made prisoners. The loss of the Americans was
comparatively small. A gold medal, presented by congress,
rewarded the heroism of the victor.
12. In September, a bloody naval battle was fought,
near the coast of Scotland, in which John Paul Jones
acquired the reputation of a daring and fortunate commander. He was a Scotchman by birth, but had been appointed,
by the American congress, a captain in their navy, and
then commanded a squadron fitted out in the ports of
France. At half past seven in the evening, his own ship,
the Bon homme Richard, of 40 guns, engaged the Serapie,
a British frigate Qf 44. After the action had continued
- 196
[1779,1779.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR,
dl hour, the two frigates approached so near to each other
-nat Jones, seizing the opportunity, lashed them together.
13. The battle now became furious, and the carnage
horrible. The Serapis was on fire not less than ten times;
and often both frigates were on fire at the same moment,
presenting a sublime and dreadful spectacle. At length,
the Alliance, one of Jones' squadron, came to his assistance; but the two frigates being fastened tcgether, mawn
of her shot struck the Bon homme Richard. At ten o'clock,
the Serapis surrendered. HIer successful antagonist was
so shattered, that the crew were obliged to leave her immediately, and she soon after sunk. The Pallas, Mhich
was also one of Jones' squadron, engaged at the same time
and captured the Countess of Scarborough. - The squadron
with the prizes then sailed for Holland, and arrived there
in safety.
14. At the close of the season, the northern army retired
into winter-quarters, one division near Morristown, in NewJersey, and the other in the vicinity of West Point, an
important post in the highlands. Here they endured severe
and constant suffering from cold, and nakedness, and hunger. Sometimes half the usual allowance, often less, was
istributed to the troops; and more than once the provi.
sions were wholly exhausted.
15. Application for relief was made to the magistrates
of the neighborhood, and intimations were given that pro.
visions, so pressing were the wants of the army, would
-be seized by force, if not furnished voluntarily. The
magistrates promptly attended to the call. They levied
contributions arbitrarily from the people, who submitted
to these exactions with a degree of patriotismn equalled
only by that displayed by the soldiers, in the patient endurance of distress.
16. Derangement in the finances produced these sufferings. Large sums had been annually raised and expended;
and the aBility of the people to pay taxes had progressively
decreased. To supply deficiencies, paper money, to the
amount of about one hundred and fifty millions of dollars,
had been issued. This gradulally depreciated, and, at the
close of 1779, thirty dollars in paper were of no more value
I han one in specie. To purchase provisions with this
laoney was at first difficult, and the.i impossible; and
congress now found their funds and their credit exhausted.
17. A change of system was necessary. For the supply
of the army, each state was directed to furnish a certain
N a

quantity of provisions and torage. Loans were solicited
fromrn the people, and nearly a million of dollalrs was raised
by bills drawn upon(the Amnerican agents in Europe, in
anticipation of loans whicht they had been authorized to
procure. These expedients afforded but temporary and
partial relief.
18. No-class of persons suffered more from the depre.
ciation of paper money thanr the army, and especially the
officers. The pay, even of those of the highest grade,
was rendered insufficient to providle them with necessary
clothing. Discontent began to pervade the whole army.
It required all the enthusiastic patriotism which distinguishes the soldier of principle; all that ardent attachment
to frieedom which brought them into the field; all the
influence of the commander-in-chief, whom they almost
adored, to retain in the service men who felt themselve.s
cruelly neglected by the country whose battles they fought.
CHAPTER XXII.
CAMPAIGN OF 1780.
THE first military operations of the enemy, in the year
1780, were directed against Charleston, the capital of
Soutlih-Carolina. In the beginning of February, Sir lHenry
Clinton appeared before that place, at the head of a l)art
of his army. The assembly, which was then sittinmp
delegated to governor Rutled(ge, a patriot of splcnldid
talents, and to his council, "the power to do every tliing
necessary for the public good, except taking away the life
of a citizen," and adjourned. Armed with this extraordinary power, he made great exertions to call into action the
strength of-the state, and to place its capital in a posture
of defence.
2. TI'he people of the country disregarded his repeated
calls. Not mnore than two hundred repaired to Charleston.
The garrison, commanded by general Lincoln, consisted of
a body of militia from the country, of the citizens, of one
thousand North-Carolina militia, and of two thousand regulars. The nuu.ber of the enemy, when all their rein.
forcements had arrived, armouinted to nine thousand.
3. On the 1st of April, the siege was begun in form, by
the erection of workls at the distance of eleven hundred
[1780.199
1780.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR
yards from the city. On the 9th, the fleet, propelled by a
strong wind, passed the forts on Sullivanr's Island, without
stoppingy to return their fire, and gained entire commanad of the harbor. On the 14th, lieutenlant-colonel
Tarleton surprised a body of cavalry, which, to preserve a
commnunieation withl the country, had been stationed at
MAlonk'sicoruer. Soon after, batteries were erected nearer
the city, fiom which the fire was incessanrt and destructive.
4. An offer to capit ulate was then made; but the British
commander refused to accept the terms proposed. On his
part, terms were offered, which were rejected by general
Lincoln. The siege was then pressed with increased
vigor, and approaches made to within musket-shot of the
American lines. The soldiers within were often killed at
their guns bv the enemy's marlksmen.
5. The citizens, whose intercession had induced general
Lincoln to determine to defend the place, perceiving that
preparations for an assault were in forwardness, and seeing
no hope of relief or escape, now req(luested him to accept
the teris which Sir Henry Clinton had proposed. A inegotiation between the two comnmanders was, in consequence, opened, and on the 12th of May, the capitulatiom
was signed.
6. Tie capital having surrendered, measures were
adopted to overawe the inhabitants of the country, and
induce them to return to their allegiance to the kIing.
Garrisons were placed in different parts of the state, and
2000 men were despatched towards Northi-Carolina, to
repel several parties of militia, who were hastening to the
relief of Charleston. Colonel Tarleton, making a rapid
march of one hundred and five miles in fifty-four hours,
met, at the WVaxhaws, and attacked one of these parties,
commanded by colonel Buford. His force being superior
was soon victorious. The vanquished, ceasing to resist,
implored for quarter. Their cries were disregarded. Upwards of two hundred and fifty were killed, or too badly
wounded to be removed from the field. This barbarous
massacre spread dismay throughout the country, and gave
a sanguinary chlaracter to future conflicts.
7. To avoid being treated as enemies, the greater part
of the inhabitants either grave their parole as prisoners,
or submitted to become   subjects of the king.  Sir
Henry Clinton, afterwards, by proclamation, discharged the
former from their parole and called upon all to embody

and sailed down the river. Fortunately tkey were met
by Lord Delaware, who had been appointed: governor of
Virginia, and who, having brought with him a supply of
provisions, persuaded them to return to Jamestown.
26. This nobleman, by the miildness of his temper and
his assiduity in business, restored order and contentment;
and the Indians were again taught to respect and fear the
English. After a short administration, he was succeeded
by Sir Thomas Dale, by whom, on the recurrence of disorderly conduct, martial law was proclaimed and rigidly
enforced. In the same year, [1611,] Sir Thomas Gates
was appointed governor. He brought with him to Virginia
a reinforcement of settlers, by whom new towns were
founded. And another charter was granted by the king,
conferring additional privileges.     -
27. In 1612, captain Argal having learned, while on a
trading voyage to the Potomac, that Pocahontas was in
the neighborhood, visited and persuaded her to go on board
his vessel. He treated her respectfully, but detained and
carried hler to Jamestown.  ie presumed that the possession of Pocahontas would give the English an ascendency
over Powhatan, who was' known to feel a strong attach.
ment to his daughter.' In this, however, he was disappointed. Powhatan, noble by nature, felt indignant at this
instance of treachery in the English. He offered a ransom for hiis daughter, but refused to consent to any terms
of peace until she was restored.
28. During her stay at.lamestown, her beauty, her artless simplicity, and those graces of manner which ever
accompany dignity of mind and innocence of heart, won
the affections of Mr. Rolfe,--a young and respectable planter. He succeeded in producing a reciprocal attachment.
They were married with the consent of Powhatan. The
conI sequence of this mnarriage was peace with:her father,
and with all the tribes who stood in awe'of his power.
29. Rolfe and his princess made a voyage to England,
where she was received by the king and queen with the
attentionl due to lher rank. For her virtues,.and her disinterested services, she was universally bcl'&amp;ed and respected. She died when about to return to America, leav
ingf one son, from whom are descended some of the most
respectable fatmilies in Virginia.  
30. In 1613, captain Argal was sent, wilh a naval force

ts militia in the service of Great Britain. Indignant at
this dishonorable conduct, which left them only the alterative of fighting for or against their country, minultitudes,
seizing their arms, resolved on a vindictive war with their
i.va4~rs,
8. A party, who had taklien refuge in North-Carolina,
chose col0el Sumpter their leader. At the head of
these, he returaed to his own state, attacked and defeato'
several scattered detachments from the British army. v
one epgagemen, SO decisive was his victory, that nine
only out aof ae,trly three hundred escaped. By a succesaiQn of gallant enterprises, he reanimated the friends of
freedom, and a spirit of determined hostility to Great
Britain was again manifested in every part of the state.
9. This spirit was cherished by thte approach, from the
north, of 4000 men, principally continentals, under the
comnmaqd of geperal Gates, On their march through a
sterile coquntry, they endured all the evils and distresses of
extreme famine. Lird Cornwallis, whom Clinton, on his
returp to Now-York, had left commander-in-chief, hastened to oppose, in person, this victorious general. He
placed himself at the head of two thousand veteran troops
who had before been stationed at Camden, on the northern
borde`r of the state.
10. On the night of the 15th of August, he marched.
with his lvhole farce, to attackl the Americans in theil
camp at Clermont. They, at the s;mpe hour, began to
move towards Camd(len. The advanced parties met in the
piglt and engaged. In several skirmnishes which took
place, the British obtained the advantage. This made a
deep impression on the minlitia, whose Spirits were depressed by glopmy forebodipgs.
1. When the morninpgdawned, the enePy advanced to
the attack. At the first onset. the Virginia militia fled,rom the field, and their exisnple was followed by others.
Phe continentals, tlihough left alone to contend with superior numbers, maintained the conflict withl great firmness.
For a short time, they had the advantage of their opponents,
but were at length overpowered, and the flight became
general.
I2. The fugitives were pursued by Tarleton's legion
with relentless fury. When all were killed, captured X
dispersed, the pursuers, with speed unchecked, took the
route towards Sumpter's encampment. This active par

ed precipitately, on hearing of the defeat of Gates. At
the Catawba ford, supposing he was beyond danger, he
halted, that his troops, who were fatigued, might repose.
Hlis sentinels slept at their posts, and the legion rode into
his camp before preparations could be made for defence.
Between three and four hundred were killed or wounded,
The remainder were dispersed in the woods; three hundred prisoners were released; all the baggage and stores
fell into the power of the victors,
13. Again supposing the state to be subdued, Cornwallis
adopted meas,'res of extreme severity to suppress every
latent inclination to revolt. He directed that all who,
having once submlitted, had lately given aid to the armies
of congress, should be deprived of their property and imprisoned; and that all, who had once borne arms with the
British, and afterwards joined the Americans, should suffer
death. In consequence of these orders, several were exe-v
outed, and many were reduced to poverty ana wretchedness.
14. In these timnes of confusion and distress, the misr
chlievous effects of slavery in facilitating the conquest of
the country, became apparent. As the slaves had no
interest at stake, the subjugation of the states was a mat.
ter of no eonsequence to theml.. Instead of aiding in its
defence, they, by a variety of means, threw the weight of
their little influence inlto the opposite scale.
15. There were yet somle citizens, who, in all fortunes,
adhered with firmness to the cause of independence. Of
thlese, in one part of the state, general Sumpter was the
leader, in anothler, general Marion. The cavalry of the
latter were so destitute cf the weapons of war, that they
were obliged to cut their swords fromn the saws of th6
saw-mnills. He was so successfuil in concealing himself
in woods and marshes, that thle enemy were never able to
attack or discover him. From thes: drk r.etmeats he
ofit.en sallied forth, and fell umxpectedly upon parties of
the enemiy, when marcliing through the country, or posted
in garrisons to overawe the inhabitanllts. In one of these
sallies, he released one hundred and fifty continentals
captu.ned at Camden. His repeated and successful excursions premarved alive the spirit of resistance, and his higlt
fame as a partizan wvas never tarnished by any violation of
the laws of' war or humanity.
O6. Qf those who submitted through fear,:r from attachment to the royal cause, major Ferguson, a Britshl
otker of distinguished merit, was appointed comnandex.202    REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
He, was despatched, by Cornwallis, into the western Dart
of North-Carolina, whiere, other tories joining hiir, hi.
bforce was augmnented to 1400 men. An enterprise against
this party was concerted by the commanders of the militia,
in the adjacent parts of the two Carolinas and Virginia.
About the 1st of October, they, by great exertions, assernbled 3000 men at Gilbert-town. ]Jrom these, fifteen hllndred choice riflemen were selected; who, mounted on tlhe
best horses, hastened to the attack of Ferguson.
17. He awaited them on the top of King's mn.)untain.
The militia, in three divisions, led by colonels Cleveland,
Shelby, and Campbell, ascended it in different directiolls.
These divisions, successively arriving, were each repulsed;
but each, when the enemy by an attack from a different
quarter, were recalled from pursuit, returned again to the
charge. In this manner the action was continued for all
hour with great spirit. Ferguson was then killed, and
with him expired the courage of his party. Eight htndred threw down their arms anid became prisoners. One
hundred and fifty were killed. Very few of the assailatlts
fell.
18. Cornwallis, confident of his ability to subjutgate the
state, had followed Ferguson into North-Carolinria. Receiving notice of his entire defeat, he returned and( took
post at Winnsborough. As he retired, Gates, who had
assembled an army of 1400 men, advanced to Charlotte,
where he determined to pass the winter. He was soon
after recalled by congress, and, on the recommendation of
Washington, general Greenme was withdrawn fi'om tihe
northern army to take command of the department of tihe
south.
19. By the northern army, which, as has been stated,
was posted at West-Point and Morristown, little more
was attempted, during the year, than towatch tile motions
of the enemy, in New-York, and protect the inhabitants
from their incursions.  The troops unfed, unpaid, and
unemployed, discovered, at various times, a disposition to
mutiny. On these occasions, the British commander, by
meamis of emissaries sent among them, invited themn to
repair to the city, where he promised themn comfort and
abundance. His invitations were disregarded. Relief
from distress was all they sought, and when that was obtained, they cheerfully returned to their duty.
20. In July, a French squadron under admiral Ternay
bringing 6000 troops, commanded by count Rochamibea
11780...... v vriTA lrJV' A'A

arrived at Rhode Island, which had previously been evacuated by the enemy; they were immiediately blockaded
in the harbor they had entered, by a British fleet. Reintorced by these troops, Washington determined to attack
New-York; the army marched to stations nearer the city,
and rejoiced in the hope of being able to accomplish
something for their country; but the arrival fromn England of another fleet, under admiral Rodney, disconrcerted
the plan which had been formed.
21. Defeat at the south and disappointment at tihe
north overshadowed the land with gloom; but intelligence that treason had appeared in the American canmp
occasioned amazement and alarmni.  The traitor was
Arnold, whom bravery in battle, and fortitude in suffering,
lad placed high in the affections of the people.
22. Upon the evacuation of Philadelphia, by the enemy
in 1778, he was appointed commander of that station.
Here, indulging in all the pleasures of an expensive equipage and sumptuous table, hlie contracted debts which he
was unable to discharge. TI'o extricate himself firom
embarrassment, he mad(le large claims against the governmenLt, a portion of which was rejected. He was accused
of extortion alid of misuse of the public money; and for
these offences was tried by a rcourt martial and sentenced
to be reprimanded by the commander-in-chief~
23. From this momnent, he determined to avenge his
wounded prid(le and supply his wants, by betraying his
country. In a letter to a British officer, be signified his
change of principle,and his wish to restore himself to the
favor of his prince, by some signal proof of his repentance.
And about this time, for a purpose which afterwards too
plainly appeared, he solicited and obtained the command
of West-Point, the most important post in the possession
of the American Armies.
24 He immediately opened a correspondence with Sir
Henry Clinton, and proposed to deliver into his power
the tost that he commanded. To agree uponl: the mode
of suirrender, major Andre, a young mrnan of spleuidid talents
and adjiutant-general of the British army, ascended the
river from New-Yorkl, and, in the night, at a. place near
the American lines, had an interview with Arnold. Before he was prepared to return, the sloop of war which
bronght him was compelled to move down the river.
25. In this emergency, Andre, disgtised as a traveller,
assuning the name of Anderson and furnished by Arnold
203204   REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
with a pass, set out to return by land to New-York
He passed all the guards and posts without awakenin1
suspicion; but was stopped, when near the end of hin
journey, by three of the New-York militia, whose name~
were Paulding, Williams, and Vanwart. Supposing therh
to be soldiers of his own army, instead of producing hit
pass, he declared himself a British officer and desired he
might not be detained.
26. On discovering his mistake, he offered them a
purse of gold and a valuable watch, and promised more
ample rewards from his government, if they would per..nit hin to escape. Rejecting, with patriotism  worthy
of all praise, these tempting offers, they condueted himn
to colonel Jameson, who was stationed near the American
lines. In his boots were found a particular statement of
the strength of the garrison, and a description of the
works at West.Point, Anxious for the safety of Arnold,
he desired the colonel to inform him that Anderson was
taken. An express was unwarily despatched with the
intelligence. Arnold, comprehending his danger, made a
precipitate flight to New-York.
27. Andre, disdaining longer concealment, then avowed
himself to be the adjutant.general of the British army.
Suspicion being now excited, colonel Jameson transmitted
to the commander-in:chief, who was not far distant, inforination of all the events which had occurred. Washington,
hastening to West Point, made arrangements for repelling
any attack that might be made. Measures of precaution
being taken, the fate of the prisoner was next to b6
decided.
98. His case was referred to a board of fflicers. Appeading before them, he confessed, with ingenuous frank.
ness, every circumstanoe relating to himself, but would
disclose nothing which might involve othlers in his,r mrisfortune. Hlie displayed, in all his conduct while a prisoner,
reat nobleness of mind; but the board, constrained by
uty, reported that he must be considered as a spy, and
agreeably to the law of nations, oughit to slffer death.
29. Sir Henry Clinton, by whorn hlie was highly esteemed,
mnde every exertion in his power to avert his fate. He
entreated, remonstrated and threatened. To have yielded,
would have betrayed timidity and weakness, and encouraged
future treason. Andre suffered an ignominious death. with
a degree of composure and fortitude which proved how
great and illustrious he might have been, hatd he not

stooped, in an evil hour, to the commission of an ignoininious action.
30. Arniold received, as the reward of his treachery,
the sum of 10,000 pounds, and the rank of brigadier-general in the British army. But he was detested by his new
associates, and his name will be for ever synoniymous
with infamy and baseness. In contrast with his, how
bright shines the fame of the three captors of Andre.
They were not then, nor can they ever be, forgotten by a
country which owes so much to their fidelity. Each
received the thanks of congress, a silver medal, and a
pensicn for life, which has been doubled at a subsequent
season of greater national prosperity.
31. At the close of the year 1780, the troops of the
northern army retired to the winter quarters which they
had last occupied. Again they endured distress at which
patriotism feels indignant and humanity weeps.  The
harvest had been abundant. Plenty reigned in the land,
but want in the camp of its defenders. Selfishness had
succeeded patriotism, lassitude enthusiasm, in the breasts
of the people, and congress exerted its. powers with too
little vigor to draw forth the resources of the country.
32. The soldiers of the Pennsylvania line were stationed at Morristown, in New Jersey. They complained
that, in addition to sustaining sufferings comnmon to all,
they were retained in service contrary to the terms of
their enlistments. In the night of the first of January,
thirteen hundred, on a concerted signal, paraded under
arms, and declared their intention of marching to Philadelphia, and demanding of congress a redress of their
grievances.
33. The officers strove to compel them to relinquish
their purpose. In the attempt, one was killed and several
were wounded. General Wayne presented his pistols
as if intending to fire. They held- their bayonets to his
breast; "We love and respect you," said they.y but if
you fire you are a dead man. We are not going to the
enemy. On the contrary, if they were now to come out,
you should see us fight under your orders with as much
alacrity as ever. But we will be amused no longer; we
are determined to obtain what is our just due4"
34. They elected temporary officers, and moved off in
a body towards Princeton. General Wayne, to prevent
them from plund- ing the inhabitants, forwarded provisions
for their use. Tne next day he followed, and requested206    REVOLUTIONARcY WAR.
them to appoint a man from each regiment, to state to him
their comrplaints. The men were appointed, a conference
held, but he refused to comply with their demands.
35. T'hey proceeded in good order to Princeton. Three
emissaries from sir Henry Clinton meeting them here,
made them liberal offers to entice them from the service of
congress. The offers were instantly rejected, and tihe
emissaries seized and confined in strict custody.  Here
they were also met by a committee of congress, and a
deputation from the state of Pennsylvania. The latter,
granting a part of their demands, persuaded them to return
to their duty. Tle agents of Clinton were then given up,
and immiediately executed as spies.
36. This mutiny, and another in the Jersey line, which
was instantly suppressed, aroused the attention of the
states to the miserable condition of their troops. The
ariount of three months pay was raised and forwarded
to them in specie. T'hey received it with joy, as it afforded evidence that thieir country was not urnindful (f
their sufferings.

OF TIlE WAR.
IN the spring of 1781, the project of besieging NewYork was again resumed. Requisitions for men and
stores wele made upon the northern states, and, in June,
the French and American troops, marching fromi their
respective positions, encamped together on ground contiguoust tohe city. But reinforcements and suppries arrived
slowly, and the want of them compelled the troops in the
field to remain inactive.
2. In tLe southern department, far different was the
fortune of the opposing armies. That of which general
Greene took the command, consisted of but 2000 men.
Nearly one half of these he despatched, under general
Morgan, into the western section of South-Carolina, where
a British party, aided by the tories, were plundering and
murdering the vwhligs witlhouit mercy and without restraint.
3. Against the Americanii detachment, Cornwallis despatched Tarleton, withl a force considerably superior, and

a large proportion of it cavalry. Morgan began to retreat,
out disdaining to fly from an enoemy, and uncertain whether
he could escape an officer so distinguished as his pursuer
for the celerity of his movements, he, on the 17th of
January, halted at the Cowpens, and determined to hazard
a battle, before his troops became dispirited and fatigued.
4. Soon after he had placed his men, the British van
appeared in sight. Confident of an easy victory,Tarleton
rushed to the charge with his usual impetuosity. The
militia posted in front yielded, as directed by Morgan, to
the shock; and the infantry composing the second- line,
retreated a few yards. In the ardor of pursuit, the enemy
were thrown into disorder: the infantry, facing about,
poured upon them a fire as deadly as it- was unexpected.
Their disorder was increased, and a charge withl the bayonet completed their overthrow. One hundred of the
enemny were killed, and five hundr-6d made prisoners.
5. Seldom has a victory, achieved by so small a number,
been so important in its consequences. It deprived Cornwallis of one fifth of his force, and disconcerted his plans
tor the reduction of North-Carolina. Hle sought, however,
to repair, by active exertions, tlhe loss wlv('h he had suf-t:
fered. Havingv learnt that Morg.rn, the instant after his
victory, had marchled with his prisoners towards Virginia,
he determined, if possible, to intercept him, and compel
1him to restore his trophies.
6. Now commenced a military race which has hardly
its parallel in history. Each arinmy strove to arrive first
at the fords of the Catawba, from which both were equally
distant. The American troops endured almiost incredible
hardships.  They were sometimies without meat, often
without flour, and always without spiritous liquors. Many,
marching over frozen ground without shoes, marked with
blood every step of their progress.
7. On the twelfth day after the battle, Morgan reached
the fords and crossed the Catawba. Two houtrs afterwards, Cornwallis arrived, and, it being then dark, encamped on the bank. In the night, a heavy fall of rain
made the river impassablle. This gave Morgan an opportunity to remove the prisoners beyond the reach of his
ursuer. And here he was joined by general Greene, who,
leaving the main body of his army, with orders to march
towards Virginia, had ridden, with but two or three attendants, one hundred and fifty miles for that purpose.
8. At the end of three days, Cornwallis found means toos8   IREVOLUTIONARY WAR.
pass the river. The retreat and pursuit again commenced;
On the second night, the Americans reached a ford on thle
Yadkin. Before all had crossed, the British appeared1
and a part of the baggage Was left in their power. Again
the two armies lay encamraped on the opposite banks, and
before morning, this river also was made imrpassable by
the rain. Trhis second preservation from immrrinent danger,
persuaded the Americans that their cause wais faVored of
heaven.
9. The next days Greene proceeded to Guilford courthouse, where he was joined(l by the other division of his
army. Cornwallis, marching uip thle Yadkin, crossed at
the shallow fords near its source. Both armies now starite(l
for the river Dan, on the borders of Virginia, aiid distant
more than one hiundred niiles. The knowledge that thern
the course must terminate, gave fiesh vigor to the troopst
and a new impulse to their speed. On the filfh dJay the
American army, havingi in thie last tWenty-four hoirs,
marched fbrty miles, crossed the river in boats which had
been collected for the purpose, and( scarcely were~they ovet
whlen the British appeared on the opposite store.
10. Chagrined that his adversary had thtus eluded his
grasp, Cornwallis wheeled about anrd marched( sullejly tn
Hillsborough. lHere many loyalists resorted to his standard. Six hundred Virginia militia having, in the meart
timie, joined the Amnericain army, Greene detertiined to
recross tihe Dan, and, by his presence in Northl-Caroe]tai
support the courage of tihose  ho had emnbraced the cause
of indei endence,
11. Cornwallis hairving detached Tarletonrf, wlthi his legiot,
to the country on the branches of the Haw rivers in order
to countenance the rising of the loyalists in that neighborhliood, a body of cavalry1 under lieutenant-colonel Lee1
and of militia under general Pickens1 were directed to
march thither and attack him. Lees who led the van,
overtook, in a long lanef a band of tories, on their way to
the enemy, Mistaking him for Tarleton, they expressed
a lively joy at the meetingi and declared their zealous
attachlment to the royal cause.
12.. Heping to surprise Tarleton, who was but a mile in
advance, Lee forbore to correct their error; but while he
was endeavoring to pass them, the militia came up arind
engaged their rear.  Relinquishing his first projeet, he
ordered his cavalry to fall upon the tories, who were
slaughtered without roaroy, while protesting they wets
[1777,209
1781.]  REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
"thle very best friends of the king." Between two and
three. lundred were killed.  Tarleton, alarmed by the
firing, retreated instantly to Hillsborough. On his way,
he cut --own a small party of royalists, mistaking them for
wig militia.
13. Leaving Hillsborough, Cornwallis next encamped
near Guilford court-house.  Greene, having been still
flirther strengthened by several bodies of militia, pursued
and offered him battle. On the 15th of March, an engagenient was fought. At the first fire, the North-Carolina
miilitia, who were in the front line, fled. The second line
w-as also routed. Tihe continentals, who composed the
third, fought with their usual bravery, and for an hour and
a half maintained the conflict with great firmness. They
at length gave way, but retreated in good order, the
slaughter they had made in the enemy's ranks preventing
pursuit. Both sides sustained nearly an equal loss.
14. This victory, won by a far inferior force, was more
glorious than advantageous to the British army. Greene,
expecting and desiring to be attacked at his place of retreat
made preparations for a second engagement. Cornwallis,
far fronm courting a battle, deemed it prudent to retire to
Wilmington, near the sea. He was pursued for a few
(lays, but so excessive had been the sufferings of the
Americans, from hunger and fatigue, that many fainted on
the march, and at Rainsay's mills the army halted to seek
refreshment and repose.
15. After remaining three weeks at Wilmington, Cornwallis proceeded to Petersburgh, in Virginia.  From
Ramsay's mills, Greene marched towards Camden, where
were posted nine hundred mrnen, under the command of
lord Rawdon.   Hle took a position on H-Iobkirkl's hill,
about a mile from the British entrenchments. At this
position, the Americans were attacked on the 25th of
April. In the beginning of the action, their bravery gained
advantages which, in its progress, were lost by the premniature retreat of two companies, occasioned by the death
of all their officers. At this reverse of fortune, Grcene
retired a few miles from the field, both armies havilng
sustained nearly an equal loss.
16. In April and May, several British posts in SouthCarolina, fell into the power of the brave and active
partizans, who, with small bodies of troops, were eveI

exped(lition, and, when returning, visited a Dutch trading
establishment on Hudson's rivers which was also withlin
the same limnits. The governor, too feeble to resist, acknowledged himself subject to the kinig of England.
31. The king, in his instructions given at the time of
the first emigration to Jamestown, directed that all the
land should be owned inr common, and th-at the produce of
the labor of all should be deposited in the public stores.
In such circumstances no one would labor with the same
steadiness and animation as if lie, and he alone, was to
possess and enjoy the fruit of his icndustry. A different
regulation was now adopted. T'o each inhabitant, three
acres of land were assigned in full property, and he was
permitted to enmploy, in the cultivation of it, a certain portion of his time. The effects of this alteration were immediately visible, and demonstrated so clearly its wisdom,
that snort after another assignment of fifty acres was made;
and the plan of working in a common field, to fill the public
stores, was entirely abandoned.
32. Since the year 1611, the colony had been governed
by mrnartial law, which was administered by deputy governor Argal, with so much rigor as to excite universal dis
content. T'he council in England, listening to "he coinplaints of the Virginians, appointed Mr. Yeardly governor,
anrid instructed him to inquire into and redress their wrongs.
He arrived in April, 1619, and imrnmediately, to the great
joy of the inhabitants, called a general assembly of the
colony. It mret at Jamestown, on the 19th of June, and
was composed of delegates from the boroutghs, then
amounting to seven. They, the governor, anid the council, sat and deliberated in the same apartment, and acted
as one body.
33. Emigrants continued to arrive frequently from England, but nearly all were men, who came for the purpose
of obtaining wealth, and intended eventually to return.
With such views, they were evi:dently less useful to the
colony than if they should be indtuced to regard it as their
home, aind as the abode of thlleir posterity. To produce
this desirable attachment to the country, ninety girls,
young and uncorrupt, were sent over in the year 1620, and
sixty more in the subsequent year, and immediately sold
to the young planters as wives. The price was, at first,

were quick, but the whigs slow, to, follow; and in its pro..

mand of the British troops, in South-Carolina, devolved
upon lieutenant-colonel Stewart. In the beginning of
September, he took post at Eutaw.  Greene marched
against him from the High Hills of Santee. Their forces
were equal, amounting on each side to two thousand men.
On the 8th, a battle was foulght, more bloody perhaps than
any which had occurred during the war. The attack was
made by the Americans; the British, resolute and brave,
made an obstinate resistance, but were at length driven
in disorder from the field.
20. A small number, on their retreat, took possession
of a large brick house, and others of an adjoining picketed
garden. From these strong positions, a deadly fire was
poured upon the Americans, who persisted, for a long time,
in a rash attempt to take them by storm. This check
enabled the British commander to rally his br-oken bat.
talions, and bring them again into action. Greene, despairinu of further success, withdrew his troops, carrying
with lhim his wounded and prisoners.
21. The loss on both sides was uncommonly great, in
proportion to the numbers engaged. On the American
side, the number of killed and wo-lunded amounted to five
hundred and fifty; on that of the British, as stated( by
themselves, to almost seven hundred. This sanguinaay
battle was followed by the retreat of the British aTry
towards Charleston.  The Amnericans pursued, and hy
esta,lishing a chain of posts at a short distance fromn that
city, protected the state fromn their incursions.
22. Cornwallis, who left North-Carolina in April, arrilved
at Petersburgh, in Virginia, on the 20th of May. He there
formed a junction with a British detachment, which, commanded at. first by Arnold and afterwards by Phillips, had
reviously gained possession of Richmond and Portsmouth.
WVi;h the force now at his commnand, he flattered himself
that he should be able to add this state also to the list of
hiis conquests. -
23. The American troops, stationed in Virginia for its
defence, were indeed entirely insufficient to oppose any
effectual resistance.  Under their gallant leader, tihe
Mlarquis de la Fayette, they accomplished even more than
was expected; but were unable to prevent the enemy from
marching through the country, and destroying much public
and private property.
04. From these excursions, Cornwallis was recalled te
the sea-coast by hlis ommVan(ler- in-ch;ef,who,having interO,'$212          REVOLUTIONA1WIY WAV                  [1a.
cepted a letter from Washington to Coingress, became acquainted with the danger which threateined New-York. -Ie
was directed to take a position near the ocean, where iis
army and the fleet might afford mutual protection, until the
event-of the operations of the north should be known. He
selected Yorktown and Gloucester poinit, situated of opposite sides of York-river, which empties into Chesapeake
b)ay. He had anl army of more than 10,000 men, and applied all his mneans, with unwearied industry and zeal, t(i
fortify these commlanding positions.
25. In the mean time, but little progress had been made
in the preparations to besiege New-York. Of the 600(0
men, whom the northern states were required to furnlish
for that purpose, a few hundred only, at the beginning of
August, had joined the armny. On the other hand, tlhe
enemy in the city had beet strengthened by the arrival of
3000 Germans. In this posture of affairs, the idea of an
expedition against Cornwallis occurred to thle comnmanderin-chief. Whlile deliberating on the enterprise, lie receivedi
information tthat a French fleet, under the count de Grass,,
with 3000 troops &lt;xi board, was.on the way tt America,
and destined to the Chesapeake.
26. fe hiesitated no longer, hut determndneil to conduct
the expedition in person. Thie s;how of an initention to
attack New-York, was neverthleless preserved. After
the troops left their respective positions, and crossed the
Hutdson, their march was so directed as to lead Sir Henry
Clinton to believe that it was the object of Washington
to gain possession of' Staten Island, inr. order to facilitate
his designs against the city. The despatchles he had intercepted assisted to deceive him, and not until the arrnmy
had crossed the Delaware, and was thus heyord the reach
of pursuit, did hlie suspect the real object of his adversary.
27. He then determnined to profit by his absence, or
recall him, by some daring enterprise at the north. Giving
to the traitor Arnold, who had just returned from Virginia,
the command of a strong detachment, hlie sent him against
New-London, a flourishing city situated upon the river
Thames, in his native state' Nearly opposite, on a hill
in Groton, stood fort Griswold, which was then garrisoned
by militia, hastily summoned from  their labors in the
field.
28. Against this fort Arnold despatched a part of his
troops. It was assaulted on three sid(es at the same mo-'-).t. The garrison, fighlting in view of their p)ro)perty
[1.71.1781.J      REVOLUTIONARY WAR.                     213
and their homes, made a brave and obstinate resistance.
By their steady and well directed fire, many of the assailants were killed. Pressing forward with perseverilng
ardor, the enemy entered the fort through the embrazures.
Immnediately all resistance ceased. Irritated by gallantry
Which should have caused admiration, a British officer
inlquired who commanded the fort. "I did," said colonel
Ledyard, "but you do now," and presented him his sword.
Hle seized it, and with savage cruelty plunged it into his
bosom. This was the signal for an indiscriminate massacre. Of one hundred an(l sixty men, composing the
garrison, ail but forty were lilled or wounded, and most
of them after resistance had ceased.  Seldom has the
glory of victory been tarnished by such detestable barbarity. The enemy then entered New London, which
was set on fire and consumed. The property destroyed
was of immense value. Perceiving no other object within
the reach of his force, Arnold led back his troops to NewYork.
29. The march of VWashington was not arrested by thlis
barbarous inioad. He pressed forward with the utmost
speed, the great object in view imparting vigor to his troops.
At Chester, he received the clieering intelligence, that
admiral de Grasse had entered the Chesapeake with a force
sufficiently strong to prevent the escape of the enemy by
water. On the 25th of September, the last division of
the allied forces arrived at the place appointed for their
meeting. The whole consisted of 16,000 men, and was
furnished with a large and powerful train of battering
artillery.
30. A body of troops under general de Chloise was stationed to watch the small garrison at Gloucester Point,
on the north bank of the river; and on the 2tth the several
divisions, destined to besiege the main garrison at Yorktown, reached the positions assigned them. On the iiight
of the 6th of October, advancing to within 600 yards of
the enemy's lines, they begun their first parallel, antd
labored with such silence and diligence, that they were
not discovered until morning, when the works they had(
raised were sufficient to protect them.
31. On the 9th, several batteries being completed, a
heavy cannonade was begun. Many of the enemy's guns
were dismounted, and portions of their fortifications laid
level with the ground. On the night of the 11th, the
besiegers commenced their second uarallel, three hundred

yards in advance of the first. This approach was made
so much sooner than was expected, that the men were
not discovered at their labor, until they had rendered them.
selves secure from all molestation in front. The fire Irol,
the new batteries was still more furious and destructive.
32. From two Britishredoubts, in advance of their main
works, and flanking those of the besiegers, the men in the
trenches were so severely annoyed that Washingtonre
solved to storm them. The enterprise against one was
commnitted to an American, that against the other to a
French detachment. Colonel Hamilton, who led the van
of the former, made such an impetuous attack, that possession was soon obtained, with little slaughter. Retaliation for the carnage at fort Griswold mighit have been
justified.  But "the soldiers,"' said colonel Hamilton,
"incapable of imitating examples of barbarity, and forgetting recent provocation, spared every man that ceased
to resist." The French detachment was equally brave
and successful, but, opposed by a stronger force, sustained
a more considerable loss.
33. Cornwallis, perceiving no hope of safety but in flight,
attempted, on the evening of the 16th, to cross over to
Gloucester, intending to force his way through the troops
utnder de Choise, and proceed by rapid marches to NewYork. Before reaching the opposite shore, with the first
division of his army, a storm dispersed his boats and cornpelled him to abandon the project.
34. On the morning of the 17th, additional batteries
were completed bythe besiegers. Thie cannonade became
too powerful to be resisted. The enemy's works were
sinking rapidly under it, and nearly all their guns were
silenced. Before noon, Cornwallis beat a parley, and proposed that commissioners should be appointed to settle
terms of surrender. They were accordingly appointed,
and on the 19th of October, the terms which they had
agreed upon were ratified by the respective commanders.
35. The naval force in the harbor was surrendered to
de Grasse, the garrison to the American general. To the
garrison, the same terms were granted as had been conceded to the troops who capitulated at Charleston; and
general Lincoln, who was present, was designated by
Washington to receive the sword of Cornwallis. The
number of prisoners exceeded seven thousand, of whom
nearly three thousand were not fit for duty.
36. On no occasion during the war, did the American

Holland, he succeeded in obtaining a loan at Amsterdam,
when the resources of his country were almost exhausted,
and in concluding with that republic a treaty of amity and
commerce.
40. As colleagues with him, congress now appointed
Benjamin Frankllin, John.Jay, and Henry Lajirenrs. The
first was minister to France. He was beloved by his
country for the services he had rendered her; and illustrious throughout the world for his inventive genius and
practical philosophy. John.Jay was a native of New-York;
was distinguished for the purity of his moral character,
and his attachment to the rights of mankind. He had
long been a member of congress, and was then the representative of the United States at the Spanish court.
Henry Laurens was a citizen of South-Carolina, had been
president of congress, had been appointed minister to
Holland, but when crossing the ocean, was captured by a
British cruiser and confined, on a charge of treason, to the
tower of London. In the endurance of sufferings in his
country's cause, he displayed a character formed after the
models of antiquity.
41. To negotiate with these, Mr. Osivald was appointed
on the part of Great Britain. The conferences were held
at Paris, where, in November, 1782, preliminary articles
were agreed upon. These were to tbrm the basis of a
definritive treaty, the conclusion of which was deferred
utiil peace should take place between France, the ally of
the United States, and Great Britain. That event occurred on the- third day of December, 1783; and, on the
same day, a definitive treaty between the parent coulntry
and her late colonies was also signed.
42. The provisions of the treaty attest the zeal and
ability of the American. negotiators, as well as the liberal
feelings which actuated the nIIew British ministry. TI'he
ind(lependence of the United States was fuilly acknowledged.
rphe right of fishing on the banks of Newfoundland, and
certain facilities in the enjoyment of that right, were
secured to them for ever; and territory was ceded to them
more extensive than the most sanguine had dared to anti--
cipate or to hope.  During the negotiation, France, to.
ensure the future dependence of her allies ulpon herself;
endeavored, by secret intrigues, to prevent them  from.
obtaining as favorable terms as even their late enenmies
were willing to grant-a striking proof of the selfishness
of nations.

REVOLUTIONARY'WAR.
43. While the negotiations were pending, the American
troops were retained in service, but remained unemployed
at their various stations. They saw withi pleasure the
end of their toils approaching, but apprehended, that their
country, when she no longer needed their services, would
forget with what zeal and fidelity they had been rendered.'rhe officers, especial]y, dreaded that, after having, for
want of pay, expended their private fortunes, and after
having exhausted their strength in the performance of
arduous and protracted services, they should be dismissed
in poverty, without any secure provision for their future
support.
44. In the course of the war, a resolution had been
adopted by congress, stipulating that the officers, after
being disbanded, should receive half-pay for life. This
resolution had never been ratified by the requisite number of
states, and no safe reliance could therefore be placed upon it.
In December, 1782, the officers forwarded to congress a
petitiGn praying that all arrears which were due to them
might be discharged, and that, instead of half-pay for life,
a sum equal to five years full pay should be paid or secured
to them when disbanded.
45. The delay of congress to comply with this request
produced an alarming agitation in that portion of the army
stationed at Newburgh. An address to the officers was
privately circulated, written with great ability, and admirablv well fitted to work upon those passions which recent
sufferings and gloomy forebodings had excited in every
bosom. The writer boldly recomnimended that, as all the
app)lications to the sympathy and justice of congress had
failed of success, an appeal should be made to their fears.
46. Fortunately the commander-in-chief was iln camlp.
Though conscious that the officers had just cause of coinplaint, he was aware that duty to his country and even
friendship for them, required that he should prevent th
adoption of rash and disorderly expedients to obtain redress. Calling them together, he, by a calm and sensible
address, persu ed them to rely still longer upon the disposition of congress to perform for them whatever the
limited means of the nation would permit.
47. In a letter to that body, giving an account of these
occurrences, he maintained and enforced the claims of the
officers with such pathos and strength of reasoning, that
their request was granted.  In November, 1783, the

their fellow citizens. In the same month, New-York
was evacuated by the British troops. General Washington) taking an affectionate leave of his officers, repaired
to Annapolis, where. congress was sitting, and there, at a
public audienee, with dignity aind sensibility, resigned his
commission as commander-in-chief of the American
armies. Then, with a character illustrious throughout
the world, he returnedto his residence a.t Mount Vernon,

CHAPTER XXIV.
ADOPTION OF TIHE CONSTITUTION,
AND
WASHIINGTON'S ADMINISTRATION.
IrO,PKNDRNCE and peace did not imnmediatelv produce
all the advantages which had been anticipated by an ardent
and salguine people. The evils of war were protracted
beyond its duration. Public and private debts bore heavily
upon the people, restraining their enterprise and demat:nding
all their resoulrces.
2. Unsupported by the sense of imminent and common
danger, the articles of confederation were found insufficient
toaccompllishl the purposes of a national government. They
conferred tipon conrgress the power, not to raise money,
but mereiy to make requisitions upon the states. These
were often disregarded, no authority being given to enthrce obedience. The revenue was therefore deficient,
the public creditors were unpaid, and the national secturities
or evidences of debt depreciated so low that they were
often sold tfr onre eighth of their nominal value.
3. Neither did these articles confer the power to regulate
commerce. Congress, therefore, could not make comnmercial treatics with foreign nations which wouldi be obligatory
upon the individual states.- Unprotected by treaties, and
unlisupported by cotuntervailing regulations, the Americar
mnierchants were denied all participationt, except on terms
at once burde 3some and degrading, in the commerce of
the world. T, a trade between the several states, whion

were considered separate and -lndependent sovereignties,
was also embarrassed by numerous restrictions, producing
frequent collisions, and diminishing the benefits which
naturally flow from the unfettered enterprise and industry
of man. Commerce languished; and from the want of
its vivifying influence, all the energies of the country were
dolmant.
4. To reme(ly these evils, congress applied to the states
for a grant of the power to regulate commerce, and to.ollect a revenue from it. New-York alone refused; but
ms unanimity was requisite, her single negative defeated
the project. In the mean time, the distress increased,
and in Massachusetts, where it was greatest, urged to
insurrection a portion of theAinhabitants. Near the close
of the year 1786, they assembled, to the number of two
thousand, in the northwestern part of the state, arnd, choosing Daniel-Shays their leader, demanded that the collect ion of debts should be suspended, and that the legislature
should authorize the emission of paper money for general
tirculation.
5. Two bodies of militia, drawn from those parts of the
state where disaffection did not prevail, were immediately
despatched against them, one under the command of general Lincoln, the other of general Shepard. They were
easily dispersed; and afterwards abandoning their seditious
purposes, accepted the proffered indemnity of the governinent.
6. So early as 1783, John Adams, being then minister
in Eutrope, and seeing in what light the American confederation was regarded by foreign nations, suggested to
congress the expediency of effecting a closer union of the
states, and of conferring more efficient powers upon tlhe
general government. A convictionl of the necessity of
such a course was also felt by general Washington, and
mrnost of the distinguished patriots of that period. In September, 1786, upon the proposition of Mr. Madison, of
Virginia, a convention of commissioners from five of the
middle states, was held at Annapolis, for the puLrpose of
devising and recommending to the states a uniform system
of commercial regulations.
7. These commissioners, after deliberating upon the
subject, came to the conclusion that nothing short of a
thorough reform of the existing government should be
attempted. This opinion was expressed in the report of
their proceedings, which was laid before congres. That

1786.1one hundred, and afterwards, one hundred and fifty pounds
of tobacco, then selling at three shillings the pound: and
it was ordained, that debts, contracted for wives, should
be paid in preference to all others.
34. About the same time, another measure, of a different character, was adopted. The company were ordered
by the king to transport to Virginia one hundred idle and
dissolute persons, then in custody for their offences.
They were distributed through the colony, and employed
as laborers.
35. A Dutch vessel also brought into James river twenty
Africans, who were imrmediately purchased as slaves.
This was the commencement, in the English American
colonies, of a traffic abhorrent to humanity, disgraceful to
civilization, and fixingo the foulest stain upon the character
of the age and people.
36. The colony was nowin the full tide of prosperity.
Its numbers had greatly increased, and its settlements
were widely extended. At peace with the Indians, it reposed in perfect security, and enjoyed without alloy all the
happiness which its fortunate situation and favorable prospects afforded. It was doomed to experience a reverse
of fortune, sudden, distressing, and terrible.
37. Powhatan, the friend of the English, was dead.
Opecancanough, a chief endowed witht all those qualities
which gi':e ranklc and reputation to an Indian warrior, had
suceceeded him in his influence and power, but he was the
secret and implacable enemy of the whites. By his art:and eloquence, he united all the neighbouring tribes in the'horrible design of destroying every man, woman, and chil
in -he English settlements.
38. The plan was concerted and matured, with all the
secrecy and dissimulation which characterize the savages.
While intent on their plot, they visited the settlements,
lodged in the houses, bought arms of the English, and even
borrowed their boats to enable them to accomplish their
barbarous purpose.
39. On the evening before the fatal day, they brought
them presents of game; and the next morning came freely
amrnong them, behaving as usual. Suddenly, precisely at
mid-day, the blow fell, at the same instant, upon the unsuspecting settlers; and three hundred and forty-seven men,
women, and children, were:victims to savage treachery
and cruelty. The massacre would have been more extensire had not a domesticated Indian, residing in one of

body adopted, in consequence, a resolution recommendin
that a convention of delegates fiom all the states should
be held at Philadelphia, for the purpose of revising the
articles of confederation, and reporting such alterations as
would render the federal constitution adequate to the
exigencies of government, and the preservation of the union.
8. With this recomnmendation all the states, except
Rhode Island, complied; and in May, 1787, the convention
met. Of this body of venrerable and illustrious statesmen,
George Washington was unanimously elected president.
They deliberated with closed doors, and at the end of
four months, agreed uipon a constitution for the United
States of America, which, after being reported to congress.
was submitted for ratification to conventions holden in the
respective states.
9. This constitution, under which the citizens of this
republic have enjoyed such unexampled happiness and
prosperity, differs, in many particulars, from the aiticles
of confederation.  It connects the states more closely
together, by establishing a general and supreme government composed of thlree departments, legislative, executive,
and judicial.
10. The legislative department consists of a seniate and
house of representatives, and is styled the congress.'I'he
members of the house are chosen by the people, and hold
their offices two years. They are ap)portioned amlong the
several states, according to the number of inhabitants, as
ascertained every tenth year by the census, deducting
two fifths of the slaves.
11. The senators are the representatives of the states,
in their sovereign capacity, and are chosen by the state
legislatures, each choosing two. The constitution ordained
that on assembling at the first se;-sion, they should be
divided, as equally as possible, into three classes. Those
composing the first class were to hold their offices but two
years; those composing the second class, four years;
those composing the third, six years. All subsequently
chosen were to hold their offices six years, except such as
shlould be chosenii to supply the p)laces of those who died or
resigned. Besides their legislative power, they have, in
concurrence with the execlitive, a voice in all appoint
ments to office, and in the ratification of treaties.
12. The executive power is vested inr a president ap
pointed by electors. These electors are chosen in the
respective states' in suclh manner as the different legisla
2  
[1787.1i787.1          CONFEDI)ERATION.                2
tures may prescribe, and are eqllal in number to the senators and representatives frorrm the state in congress. If,
however, no person receives a majority of the votes o'
these electors, the president is then chosen by the repre
seitatives, those from each state havinrg but one vote.
He is elected for four years; but he may be impeached by
the house, tried by the senate, and, if convicted of misconduct, may be removed from office. -He is commanderin-chief of the land and naval forces. He nominates to
the senate all officers of thle general government. and( with
the advice and consent of two-thir(ls of that body,ratifies
treaties. A vice-president is chosen at the same time,
and in the samne manner, to perform all the duties of
president whenl that office is vacant by death, resifgnation,
or removal.
13. To pass a law the house and senate must concur,
and it is then to be sent to the president, who must approve
it. If he does not approve it, he must return it withi his
objections; and it must then be agreed to by two-thirds
of both branches. Laws thus enacted are obligatory upon
the citizens individually, and may be executed by officers
appointed by the president alld senate. Under the confederation, the ordinances of congress operated,nly upon
the states, and no efficient mode wvas provided for enforcingf them.      -
14. The constitution confers on congress the power to
declare war; to raise and support armies; to provide and
maintain a navy; to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,
and excises; to reTgullate commerce; to coin money; and
all other powers of a general or national character. It
diminishes, in no respect, the liberty of the citizen, bLt
transfers a portion of the powers, previously exercised by
the state governments, to the government of the union.
15. The judicial power of the United States is vested
in a supreme court, and such inferior courts as the congress
may establish; and it extends to all cases arising under
the constitution, the laws of congress, and treaties; to all
cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to all controversies between citizens of different states, and between
foreigners and citizens: the judges hold their offices during
good behavior.
16. The new constituition found opposers as well a.
advocates, and both were equally zealous. The former,
ardentlyattached to liberty, imagined that rulers possessing suchI extensive swvay, suehi abundant patronage an4
T 2such independent tenure of office, would become fond of
the exercise of power, and in the end, arrogant and tyrannical. The latter professed equal attachmnent to liberty, but
contended that, to preserve it, an energetic government
was necessary. They described, with powerful effect, the
evils actutally endured from the inefficiency of the confederation, and demanded that a trial at least should be
mniade of the remedy proposed. These took- the name of
federalists, as triendly to a union of the states; the appellation of anti-federalists was given to their antagonists.
17. In the conventions of eleven states, a majority,
though in some instances a small one, decided in favor of
its ratification. Provision was then made for the election
of the officers to compose the executive and legislative
departments. To the highest station, the electors, by a
uaniamous vote, elected George Washington, illustrious
for his virtues and militarv talents. To the second, that
of vice.president, by a vote nearly unanimous, they elevated John A dams, who, in stations less conspicuous, had,
with equtal patriotism, rendered important services to his
cou ntry.
18. The foi)urth of March, 1789, was the day designated
for the new government to commence its operations. The
delays incident to its first organization, prevented the
inauguration of the president, until the 30thl of April.
The ceremony was witnessed, with inexpressible joy, by
an immnense concourse of citizens.  In an impressive
address to both houses of congress, hle declared, with
characteristic modesty, his " incapacity for the mighty and
untried cares before him," and offered his " fervent supp}ications to that Almighty Being, whose providential aid
can supply every human defect, that his benediction would
consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of
the United States, a government instituted by themselves
for these essential purposes; and would enable every
instrument, employed in its administration, to execute,
with success, the functions allotted to his charge."
19. He also expressed his firm conviction, "that the
foundation ot' our national policy would be laid in the pu.re
and immutable principles of private molality; and that
the pre-eminence of a free government would be exemr
plified by all thlle attributes which can win the affections
of its citizens, and command the respect of the world."
20. "I dwell," said he, "on this prospect with every'atif.facti,'wldvi.h an ardernt!ovi for iJy coluntry can

of nature, an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage; between the genuine
maximns of an hlonest and magnanimrous policy, and thke
solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity; and since
the destiny of the republican model of government is
justly considered as DEEPLY, perhlaps as FINALLY, staked
on the experiment intrusted to the American people."
21. To establish a revenue sufficient for the support of
government, and for the discharge of the debt contracted
in the revolutionary war, was the first object of congress.
For this purpose, duties were laid on the importation of
merchandise, and on the tonnage of vessels; and from
these sources were drawn into the national treasury,
funds whioh had before been collected and appropriated
by thie states on tlhe sea coast.
22. Laws, creating a department of state, of the treasury and (of war, were enacted; and Mr. Jefferson, Mr
Hamilton, and( general Knox, appointed seeretaries or
principals.  A  national jutdiciary was constituted and
organixzed. A resolve was l)asse(ld, dtirecting the secretary
of the treasury to prepare a plan lbr the support of public
credit; antI arnei-dments to the constitution we.re prop(osed, which were stbselqueiltly ratified by thte states
alnd which, removing maniy of the objections made to it.
red(iered it acceptabl)e to all.
93. After the adjournment of congress, the president
made a tour- through New-England, where he was reeeived by the inhabitants with an affection bordering on
adoration. People of all classes crowded to behold the
man whose virtues and talents exalted him, in their view,
above the heroes of ancient and modern times; and to
present to htim the indissembled homage of their grateful
hearts.  But to none did his visit give more exquisite
pleasure than to the officers and soldiers of the "patriot
army," who had been his companions in suffering and
in victory, who were endeared to him by their bravery
and fid(lelity in war, and by the magnanimity with which,
in peace, they endured unmerited neglect and poverty.
24. At the next session of congress, wvhich commenced
in January, 1790, Mr. Hamilton, the secretary of the
treasutry, made his celebrated report upon the public debts
contracted during the revolutionary war. Taking an able

recomrmended that, not only the debts of the continental
congress, but those of the states arising from their exertions in the common cause, should be funded or assunmed
by the general government; and that provision shouldl be
mnade for paying the interest, by imposing taxes on certain
articles of luxLry, and on spirits distilled within the
country.
25. Upon this report an animated debate took place.
Its reeomniendations were opposed by that party whio had(
seen, or thought they had( seen, in the constitution, many
features hostile to freedom, and who remembered thiat
Mr. Hlamilton, when a member of the convention, had
proposed that the president and senate should be appointed to hold their offices during good behavior. T!hey
nlowv expressed their fears, that the assumrption of these
debts would renderl the governmentt still stronger, b)y
Irawing aroutnd it a numerouts and poweriful body of public creditors, who, in all its contests with the states or the
people, woulld be bouiltid, by tlhe strongest of all ties, that
ot' interest, to support it whether riglit or wrong.  I This
party, existing principally in the southern states, and professing an ardeat atta,.minent to the equal riglits ot 1nmal,
took the name of republican.
26). Mr. Madison prop(osed, that whenever the public
se.urities had been transferred, the highest price which
they had borne in the market shlould le paid to the purchaser, and the residue to the original holdern  AIter tan
eloquent debate, this proposition was rejected. T' he
lparty denominated federal, and existing principally in the
northern states, supported throughout, with great ability
and force of reasoning, the plans of the secretary; but on
taking the vote in the house of representatives, they were
rejected by a majority of two.
27. Afterwards this national measure was connected,
as is too frequently the case in legislative bodies, withl
one which had excited much local feeling. It was understood that, should the seat of government be fixed for ten
years at Philadelphia, and afterwards permanently at a
place to be selected on the Potomac, some southern
members would withdraw their opposition to the funding
system. A law to that effect was accordingly enacte(ld.
The former discussion was then resumed. The plans of
the secretary were adopted in the senate and afterwards
in the house, two members representing districts on the
Potomac, changing their votes.'I'Thle debt fti(led amount.ed to s little more than seventy-five millifons of doIlTrs;
upon a part of which three per cent, and upon tlie remaindel six per cerft irnterest was to be paid.
28, The effect of this measure was great and rapid.
The price of the public paper, which had fall}en to twelve
ot fifteen cents on the dollar, suddetly rose to the sum
expressed on the face of it. This difference was gained,
in most instances, by purchasers of the securities, who,
feeling indebted, for this immense accession of wealth,
to the plans of thie secretafyj regarded him witIt enthusiastic attachment. tlut in others, this wealth, suddenly
acquired without merit, excited envy and dissatisfaction.
These joined the republican party  who, fancying they
were wittnessing the fulfiliment of their predictionl, became more active in their opposition.
29. The recommendation of the secretary to impose
additional duties, wNas not acted uipon. until the next session
of cofngress, f'hose on distilled spirits were proposed in
orde! to render the burdens of the inhabitants beyond the
Alleghany rmountains, where no other spirits were consutmed, equtal to those of the inhabitants on the sea coast,
who consumed nmost of thte articles on which an import
duty was paid.  In the beginning of the year 1791, they
wvvere laid as proposed. A national bank, recomniended
also by the same officer, was in the same year incorporated. Both measures met a violent opposition from the
republican party.
30. When the new government was first organized,
but eleven states had ratified the constitution. Afterwards, North-Carolina and Rhode Island, the two dissenlting states, adopted it; the former in November, 1789,
the latter in May, 1790. Iii 1791, Vermont adopted it,
and applied to congress to be admitted into the union.
The territory of this state, situated between New-Hampshlire and New-York, was claimed by both, aiid both had
made grants of land Within its limits.  In 1777, the
inhabitants, refusing to submit to either, declared themselves independent.'Although not represented in the
continental congress, yet,- during the war, they embraced
the cause of their brethren in the other states, and to
them  their aid was often rendered, and was always
efficient. Agreeably to their request, an act was now
passed, co)nstituting Vernmont one of the members of the
union. An act was also passed, declaring that the district
of Kentucky, then a part of' Virginia, should be a(dmitted
ADNIINISTRA 10n,

into the union on the first day of June, in the succeeding
year.
31. In 1791, was completed the first census or enumeration of tihe inhabitants of the Ulnited States. They
amounted to 3,921,32(;, of which number 695,655 were
slaves. The revenuie, according to the report of the
secretary of the treasury, amrounted to 4,771,000 dollars,
the exports to about nineteen, and the inmpiorts to about
twenty mrnillions. A great improvement in the circunistances of the people began at this period to be visible. The
establishment of a firm and regular government, and confidence in the men whomn they had chosen to administer
it, gave an impulse to their exertions which bore them
rapidly forward inthe career of prosperity.
32. In 1790, a terminiation was put to the war which,
for several years, had raged between the Creek In(lians
and the state of Georgia. Pacific overtures were also
made to the hostile tribes inhabiting the banks of the
Scioto and the Wabash.'These being rejected, an army
of 1400 men, comnmanded by generai Haiarmer, was despatched ag,ainst them. Two battles were folught near
Chilicothe, inr Ohio, between successive detachments
fromin this armny and the Indians, in which the latter were
victorionus.
33. Emboldened by these successes, they made more
vigorous attackls uponr the frontier settlements, which
suffered all the distressing calamiities of an Indian war.
Additional troops were raised, and the comrnmand of the
whole was given to general St. Clair. With near'2000
mrnen, he marched, in October, into theiwilderness. By
desertion and detachments, this force was reduced to
fourteen hundred. On tlhe thliird of Novemnber, they encamped a few miles front the villages on the Miami,
rntending to remain there until joined- by those -who were
absent.
34. -But before sunrise, the next morning, just after the
troops were dismissed from the parade, they were attacked
unexpectedly by the Indians. The new levies, who were
in front, rushed back in confusion upon the regulars.
Tlhese, who had been hastily formed, were thrown into
disorder.  They, however, with great intrepidity, advanced into the midst of the enemy, who retired from
covert to covert, keeping always beyond reach, and again
returning as soon as the troops were recalled from pursuit.
ln these ahaiges many braYe and experienced 6fficers
226
[1792.were: killed; the loss of men was also great, arid no permanent impression was made upon the enemy.
35. At lergth, after a contest of three or four hours, St.
Ck~ir, whose ill hlealth disabled him' fromul performing the
active duties of commander, determined to withdraw from
the field the remnant of his troops, The instant that the
directions to retire were given), a disorderly flight commenced.   Fortunately for the survivers, the victorious
Indians were soor recalled fromin pursuit to the camp, by
their avidity for plunder; and the vanquished continued
their retreat unmolested to the frontier settlements.
36. In this battle, the numbers engaged on each side
were supposed to be equal. Of the whlites, the slaughter
was almost beyond example. Six hundred and thirty were
killed arnd missing, and two hund(red an(l sixty were wounded-a loss which proves at once the obstinacy of the
defence, and the bravery of the assailants. On receiving
information of this disaster, congress, resolving to prosecute the war with. inr,reased vigor, made provision for
augmenting, l)y enlistuient, the military force of the nation
to 5000 men.  
37. In the autumn of 1792, general Washington was
again unanimously elected president of the American
republic, and in Mar,th, 1793, was inducted into office.
Mr. Adamrns was re-eleeted vice-president, in opposition
to George Clinton, of Neow-York. In the progress of
these el tions, but little party feeling was exhibited; the
repose o.f 0eOiety was not disturbed, but the citizens raisedto posts of the highe-t honor those wvhom their judgments
and affections designated as the miost worthy.
38. While the Americans, with but little alloy, were
enjoying, under a government of their own choice, the
blessingrs of independence and freedom, the people of
France, by whose aid these blessin'gs had been acquired,
were experiencing all th'ne miseries of anarchy. (Greviously
oppressed by institutions originating in times of ignorance
and barbarism, they had risen in the majesty of physical
strength, and declared their determination to be free.
J g iinst a whole people, aroused by their sufferings to.
d land their rights, what effectual resistance can be
o I osed.  Beibre their energetic exertions, prompted. by
el t'iusiasm and directed by fatal skill, their ancient governm i.t crumbled to the dust.
39. Passing at once fromn abject slavery to entire liberty,th.;ir conduct was marled by- the most shocking: excesses.
P,i
27
ADMINISTRATION.
1793.1The mild virtues of their king, alleviating but slightly the
evils of despotism, could not save himn from that resentment which consigned to indiscriminate destruction the
hereditary orders. Himself, his queen, and many thousands of the nobility and clergy, suffered death on the
scaffold. A new government was instituted, having, for
its fundamental principle, the universal equality of man.
Its form was often changed, and the reinis of authority
were successively but unsteadily, held by the temporary
favorites of an unenlightened and capricious people.
40. The Americans could not regard with indifference
thisstruggle of their allies for freedom. They considered
their excesses as the first effects of sudden relief fromn
oppression, and hoped that experience would produce
sobriety of conrduct and reverence for law. Tiiey hailed
the French revolution as the offspring of their own, and.cherished the flattering expectation that, by the diffusion
of the principles of liberty, the whole civilized world
would become partakers of its blessings.
41. The French people, at the same time, regarded the
Amnericans as their brethren, bound to them by the-ties of
gratitude; and when the kings of Europe, dreading the
establishmentof republicanism in her borders, assemble(d
in arms to restore monarchy to France, they looked across
the Atlantic for sympathy and assistance.  T'he new
governmnent, recalling thie minister whom thle king had
appointed, despatcheT the citizen Genet, of ardent temper
and a zealous republican, to supply his place. In April,
1793, he arrived at Charleston, in Sjuth-Carolina, where
he was received, by the governor and the citizens, in a
manner expressive of their warmrn attachment to his country,
and their cordial approbation of the change in her institutions.
42. Flattered by his reception, and presuming that the
nation and the government were actuated by similar feelings, he assumed the authority of expediting privateers
from that port to cruise against the vessels of nations who
were enemries to France, but at peace with the United
States, a procedure forbidden by the laws of nations, and
derogatory to the government of the country. Notwithstanding this illegal assumption of power, he received, on
his journey to Philadelphia, extravagant marks of public
attachment; and, on his arrival there, "crow-ds flocked
from every avenue of the city to meet the republican am
bassador of an allied nation." Intoxicated by these con
228
WASHINGTON'S -
[1793.tinued and increased demonstrations of regard, he persisted
in forming and executing schemes of hostility against the
enemies of France.  
43. The British minister complained to the president,
who, by the unanimous advice of his cabinet, directed Mr.
Jefferson, the secretary of state, to lay before the ministel
of France the principles which would regulate the conduct
of the executive in relation to the powers at war. These
principles forbade the course which Mr. Genet had pursued. Relying on the popularity of his nation, he attempted,
by insolent and offensive declarations, to drive the president
from the ground he had taken. He threatened to appeal
from the governmnient to the people, a mreasure which other
agents of the French republic had adopted with success
in Europe. Here the result was different. The people
rallied around rulers, having the same interest as themselves. The minister was abandoned by most of his
friends; his government, at the request of the president,
annulled his powers; and fearing to return, he remained
in the country, a striking example of thie imbecility of a
factious individual among a people confiding in their rulers,
and contented with their lot.
44. This conduct of Mr. Genet, the attrocities committed by the French people, and the dreaded danger of their
example, alienated from them many of the citizens of the
United States, especially those belonging to the federal
party. And as the world was then agitated by the mighty
contest between France and Great Britain-a contest
which permitted not neutrality of feeling-those who
became-hostile to the former became naturally the friends
of the latter.'To her they were besides attracted by

45. The republicans retained an unabated affection for
the French, whose services they remembered with gratitude, and whose struggles for freedom, against the league
of European tyrants, engaged all their sympathy. Over
these two parties Washington, admitting no thought but
for his ownII country, watched with anxious solicitude,
striving to restrain their aberrations, arid to temper their
mutual animosities.

the villages, revealed the plot to his master whom he had
been solicited to murder. Information was instantly given
to some of the nearest settlements1 and just in time to
save them from the calamity which fell upon the othiers.
40. The horrid spectacle before them roused the English from repose to vengeance. A vindictive and exterminating war succeeded. The whites were victorious, destroying many of their enemies, and obliging the remain(ler to retire far into the wilderness. But their own numher melted away before the miseries of war; their settlements were reduced from eighty to eight, and famine again
visited them with its afflicting scourge. In 1624, out ol
nine thousand persons, who had been sent from England
but eigh:.een hundred existed in the colony.
41. These continual misfortunes attracted the attention
of king James. He revoked the charter which he had
granted, and committed the management of all the affairs
of the colony to a governor anld twelve counsellors, who
were to be appointed by tlhe king and to be guided by his
instructions. Of these instructions, those concerning tobacco, the principal article exported fiom the colony, may
be taken as a sample. It was ordained that those who
raised it should not themselves be permitted to dispose of
it, but should export it to England, and deliver it to certain
designated agents; and they alone were authorizedto sell it.
42. UTnder such arbitrary regulations, the people lived
end suffered, until the year 1636, when Sir John Harvey
field the office of governor. He was haughty, rapacious,
unfeeling, and fitted,-by his disposition, to exercise power
in the true spirit of his instnructions. Inflamed to mad~
ness by his oppressions, the Virginians, in a fit. of popular
rage, seized and sent him a prisoner to England. At the
same time, they despatched two deputies charged to represent the grievances of the colony and the governor's
misconduct.
43. Charles I, who was then king, indignant at the
violent proceeding, received the deputies sternly, and sent
back thle governor, invested with all his former powers.
He was, however, in 1639, succeeded by Sir William
Berkeley, who was instructed again to allow the Virginians to elect Iepresentatives. Such was their gratitude tc
the king for this favor, that dutring the civil wars between
him and his parliament, thley were faithfil to the royal
cause, and continued faithful even after he was dethroned
and his son driven into exile.

-:forces. Taking post near thle country of the enemy, he
made assiduous and long protracted endeavors to negotiate
a peace. Failing in these, he marched against theim, at
the head of three thousand men. On the 20th of Augist,.1794, an action took place in the vicinity of one of the
British garrisons, on the banks of the Miami. A rapid
and vigorous charge roused the savages fromi their coverts.
and they were driven more thani two.miles at the point of
the bayonet. Broken and dismayed, they fled xvithout
renewing the combat. Their houses and cornfields were
destroyed, and forts were erected on' the sites of the towns
laid waste. - In 1795, a treaty was;concluded at Grenville,
which-, long and faithfully observed, gave peace and security to the frontier inhabitants, permitting the abundant
population of the eastern states-to spread, with astonishing
rapidity, over the fertile region north-west of the Ohio.
47. Tihe tax which had been imposed upon spirits distilled within the country, bearing heavily upon the people
in the western counties of Pennsylvania, produced there
disaffection anrd disturbance. All excise taxes, of which
this was one, being considered: hostile to liberty, great
exertions were made to excite the public resentment
against those who should willingly pay it, a-nd especially
against the officers appointed to collect it. In'September,
1791, a large meeting of mnalcontents was held at Pittsburgh,' at which resolutions, encouraging resistance to the
laws, wvere passed; and subsequently other meetings were
held, at which similar resolutions were adopted. Committees of correspondence were also appointed to give unity
of system to their measures, and to increase the number
of their associates.  
48. A proclamation of-the president, exhorting all persons to desist from illegal comibinations, and calling on the
magistrates to execute the laws, was disregarded. T'he
mnarshall of the state, while serving processes upon delinquents and, offenders, was resisted and fired"upon. The
inspector of the revenue. dreading the indignation of the
populace, prooured a small detachment of soldiers to guard
his house. These were attackled by a bodyof five hundred
insurgents, who, setting fire to several contiguous buildings'
obliged the soldiers to leave the house, and'deliver themselves up. Several individuals, zealous in supp)orting the
government, were ordered to quit the country and compelled
to obey.  An intention was openly avowed of forcibly.230'XIVASHINGTON'S': w. TV'

resisting the general government with the view of extorting a repeal of the offensive laws. The effective strength
of the insurgents was computed at seven thousand men.
49. The president, conceiving himiself bound by the most
solemn obligations, "to take care that the laiws be faithfuilly executed," determined to call out a part of the militia
of Pennsylvania, and the adjacent states, to suppress this
insurrection. In the autumn of 1794, fifteen thousand
were detached, and being placed under the command of
governor Lee, of Virginia, were marched into the disaf
fected coiunties. The strength of this army rendering
resistance desperate, none was offered, and no blood was
shed. A few of the most active leaders were seized and
detained for legal prosecution. The great body of the
insurgents on submrissionl were pardoned, as were also the
leaders, after trial and conviction of treason. The government acquired the respect of the people, by thbis exertion
of its force, and their affection, by this display of its lenity50. Since the peace of 1783, Great Britain and the
UInited States, had each incessantly complained that:the
other had violated the stipulations contained in the treaty.
The formner was accused of having carried away negroes
at the close of the revolutionary war; and of retaining in
her possession certain military posts situated in the western wilderness, and within the limits of the United States.
in consequence of which the Americans were deprived ou
their share of the fur trade, and the Indians incited te
make incursions upon the frontier settlements. The latter
were accused of preventing the loyalists fromn regaining
possession of their estates, and British subjects frorn
recovering debts contracted before the commencement of
hostilities.
51. For the purTpose of adjusting these mutual complaints;
and also of coneluding a commercial treaty, Mr. Adams, in
1785, was appointed minister to London. Great Britain,
aware that the articles of confederation did not authorize
congress to bind the states -by a commercial treaty, declined then to negotiate.  After the constitution was
ratified, ministers were interchanged, and the discussion
was prosecuted wi-t-h no little acrimony and zeal.
52. Inr 1794, Mr. Jay being then minister from the
United States, a treaty was concluded, which, in the
spring of the next year was laid before the senate. That
body advised the president to ratify it, on condition that
an alteration should be made in one of the articles. Its

contents having, in the mean time, been disclosed, tihe
republican party exclaimed, in intemperate language,
against most of the stipulations it contained.  The
partisans of France swelled the cry of condemnation.
Public meetings were held in various parts of the union,
at which resolutions were passed expressing warm disapprobation of the treaty, and an earnest wish that the
president would withhold his ratification. -S.uch appeared
to be the wish of a great majority of the people.
53, General Washington, believing that an adjustment
of differences would conduce to the prosperity of the
republic, and that the treaty before him was the best that
could, at that time, be obtained, gave it his assent, in
defiance of popular clamor. So great was the confidence
reposed, by the people, in their beloved chief.magistrate,
that the public sentiment began immediately to change.
The friends of the treaty not only increased in numbers,
but gained courage to speak in its defence. And during
the summer of 1795, the nation was agitated by a zealous
and animated discussion of its merits.
54. At tihe next session of congress, it became a subject
of consideration in the holluse of representatives.''lThe
treaty, its negotiator, and even the president, were virulently censured, and warmly defended, in a debate which
has seldom been equalled for its intemperance, its eloquence
or its duration. On the final question, a majority of three
voted in favor of the appropriation necessary to carry it
into effect. The subsequent prosperity of American com.
merce demonstrates the wisdom of the president's decision.
55. The conduct of Spain towards the United States.
had ever been cold and unfriendly. She feared lest the
principles of liberty, and the desire of independence should
find their way into her conitiguous American provinces.
During-the negotiations at Paris, which resulIted inpeace,
she secretly exerted her influence to cause tlhe westerni
boundaries of the new republic, from the great lakes to
Florida, to be fixed two or three hundred miles east of tihe
Mississippi. To the repeated offers, which were afterwards made, to form with her a commercial treaty, and to
make arrangements respecting the mutual navigation of
that river, she pertinaciously declined to accede.
56. When the inhabitants beyond the Alleghany moun,
tains had become numerous, she denied them aceess to
the ocean by the medium of that river, the mouth of which
was within her province of Louisiana. She intended,
W2,[t7.95.perhaps, to show them the importance of that privilege
by withholding it, and to allure them, by the promise of
restoring it, to submit to her authority. The people of
Kentucky, indignant at the deprivation, laid their complaints before congress. In bold and forcible language
they asserted their rights, by the laws of God and of,natare, to the free use of that noble river, and demanded
that, at any cost, the acknowledgment of that right should
be-obtained.
57. At length Spain became involved in a war with
France. Embarrassed at home, and intimidated by the
unauthorized preparations which, under the auspices of
Genet, were making in Kentucky to invade Louisiana,
she intimnated her readiness to concelude a satisfactory
treaty, should a minister be sent to Madrid for that pur
pose. Thomas Pinkley was accordingly appointed. In
October, 1795, a treaty was signed, securing to the citizens
of the United States the free navigation of the Mississippi
to the ocean, and the privilege of landing and depositing
cargoes at New-Orleans.
58. Thus were adjusted all controversies with two
Eturopean powers, which, while they existed, retarded the
prosperity, and disturbed the tranquillity of the country
-and fiorn which, at different periods, even war was seriously
aqprehended. In 1795, a treaty was also concluded with
the regency of Algiers, with which the republic was previously at war. It stipulated that the United States, in
colntbrluity withl the practice of other nations, should, as
t,he price of peace, pay an annual tribute to the sovereign
ol' that country.
59. Within the last two or three years, several changes
to(k place in the important offices of thie aation. On the
first day of the year 1794, Mr. Jefferson resigned the office
of secretary of state. lHe had performed the duties of
tihat office withl extraordinary ability, and to thie entire
satisfaction of the presi(tdent. Having been minister to
Fiance at the conimiencemlient of tlhe revolution there, he
became acquainted with its prime movers, and, anticipating
frinom their exertions the diffusion of the principles of
liberty and the renovation of the government, was, in the
early stages of its progress, its enthusiastic and undisguised defender. Of the republican party, he was considered the leader, enjoying their highest confidence arnd
warmest attachment.   He was succeeded by Edmund
Rand,0]ph, of Virginia.

1795.1- WASHINGTON'S
60 1On the last day of January, 1795, Mr. HIamilton
retired from the office of secretary of the treasury. He
possessed distintguished talents, and had exerted those
talents to establish order whlere all was confusion, and to
raise fromn the lowest depression the credit of thie country.
His complete success greatly exalted his reputation and
to him the federalists felt a sincerity of attachuient
equalled only by that entertained for Washingrton. W~ith
him he had served ill the revolutionary war, and had then
acquired his confidence and affection, which he ever afterwards retained.  Being the advocate of an energetic
government, and averse to intrusting much power with
the people, he was peculiarly obnoxious to the republican
party. He was accused of partiality to England, and of
misconduct in office.  After the closest ocrutiny, his
official character was acknowledged, b.yhis enemies, to be
without stain. He was succeeded by Oliver Walcott, of
Connecticut.
61. At the close of the year 1794, general Knox resigned
the office of secretary of war, aind colonel Pickering, of
Massachusetts, was appointed in his place. In August
Mr. Randolph, having lost the confidence of the president,
and having in consequence retired from the administration,
Mr. Pickering was appointed his successor in the department of state, and Jamnes M'Heury, of Maryland, was made
secretary of war. No republican beiMg now at the head
of any of the departments, many of the leaders of that
party withdrew their support from the administration; and
licentious individuals, in their abusive attacks, dared to
charge even the president with corruption.  But the
confidenrce of the people in his integrity and patriotism
experienced not the slightest abatement.
62. The conduct of France towards the American republic continued to be a source of increasing trouble and(
vexation. Mr. Fauchet, the successor of Genet, bore, from
those by whom he was deputed, the strongest assurances
of friendship; but encouraged and supported by a nLiumerous
party, ardently attached to his nation, he gradually assumed
towards the administration the tone of remonstrance and
reproach. He charged it with sentiments of hostility to
the allies of the United States, -with partiality for their
former foes, and urged the adoption of a course more
favorable to the cause of liberty.

friendship. Mr. Morris, the minister to Paris having
incurred the displeasure of those in power, was recalled
at their request, and his place supplied by Mr. Monroe of
Virginriia.  This gentleman was a republican, and had
eminbraced with ardor the cause ol0 the French republic.
lie was received in the most respectful manner by the
convention, who decreed that the flags of the two republics,
intwined together, should be suspended in the legislative
hall, as a mark of their eternal union and friendship.
64. Mr. Adet was appointed soonafter, to succeed Mr.
Fauchet. He brought with him the colors of France,
which he was instructed, by the convention, to present to
the congress of the United States. They were received
by the: president with extraordinary ceremonies, transmitted to congress, and afterwards deposited in the national
archives. In the house of representatives, a resolution
was unanimously adopted, expressing the lively sensations
which were excited by this testimony of the existing sympathy of. the two republics, and their hope, that the brilliant and glorious victories of the French people, would
lead to the perfect establishment of their liberty and
happiness.
65. But France required of the United States more than
professions and hopes, and more than by treaty she was
entitled to claim. She wished to make them a party in
the war she was waging with the despots of Europe.
Failing in this, and jealous of the riiore intimate relations
contracted with her enemy, she adopted regulations highly
injurious to American commnerce, directing her cruisers to
capture, in certain cases, the vessels of the United States.
In cinsequence of these regulations, several hundreds,
loaded with valuable cargoes, were, while prosecuting a
lawful trade, taken and the whole confiscated.
66. Believing that the rights of the nation were not
asserted and vindicated with sufficient spirit by Mr. Monroe, the president recalled hili, and Charles C. Pinkney,
of South-Carolina, was appointed in his stead. In the
summer of 1796, he left the United States, instructed to
use every effort compatible with national honor, to restore
the amicable relations which had once subsisted between
the sister republics.
67. General Washington hliaving, at the sacrifice of his
own predilections, devoted a great portion of his life to

since directed its course through the mnost critical period
of an experiment under a free constitution, determined to
retire to the enjoyment of domestic happiness and rural
quiet. In September, he announced this determination to
his fellow citizens, and feeling for them all the solicitude
of a father for his children, he published at the same time
a farewell address.
68. From long experience, he had acquired an intimate
acquaintance with the dangers to which the liberties of
the republic were exposed. These he deprecated, and
Warned his countrymen to shun, with all the impressive
energy of conviction, and all the ardor of parental affection.
Ite besought them, especially, to frown indignantly, upon
the first dawning of any attempt at a separation of the
union; to discard local attachments and sectional animosities; to guard against the excessive indulgence of the
spirit of party, and against cherishing a hatred of particular
nations, and an affection for others.
69. This address was read with sentiments of profound
veneration in every part of the union. Some of the state
legislatures directed it to be inserted at large in their
journals, and most of them passed resolutions expressing
their respect for the author, their high sense of his exalted
services, anId the emotions with which they contemplated
his retirement from office.
70. To fill the station from which the father of his
country had resolved to retire, the two great political parties hrought forward their chiefs. The federalists, desiring
that the system of measures adopted by Washington should
continue to be pursued, and dreading the influence of
French sentiments and principles, made the most active
efforts to elect John Adams. The republicans, believing
their opponents less friendly than themselves to the maxims
of liberty, and too much devoted to the British nation and
to British institutions, made equal exertions to elect
Thomas Jefferson.
71. The result was the choice of Mr. Adams to be
president, and Mr. Jefferson to be vice-president. Released from public cares, Washington hastened to Mount
Vernon. Having estabrished his fame as the greatest
hero and most distinguished statesman of the age,. he
there, devoting his time to the cultivation of an extensive
farmn, added to his titles of renown that of the most indus.
trious and intelligent agriculturalist of his country.CHAPTER XXV.
MR. ADAMS'S, MR. JEFFERSON'S, AND PAR'I
OF MR. MADISON'S ADMINISTRATION.
DECLARATION OF WAR,
MR. ADAIMS, soon after the commencement of his presidential term, received from Mr. Pinkney despatches of a
most disagreeable and alarming nature. The DirectTory
then exercising the executive- authority in France, had
refused to accredit him, declaring their determination not
to receive another minister from the United States, until
they had fully complied -with the demands which had been
made. He was moreover ordered, by a written mardgate,
to quit the territories of the republic.
2. Congress vere immediately convened, and the des.
patches laid before them. Their proceedings indicated a
love of peace, but also a firm determination to yield to
no unjust demand. Laws were passed authorizing the
president, whenever he should deem  it necessary, to
detach eighty thousand men from the militia of the Unit.eo
States, providing for an increase of the navy, and for
augmenting the revenue of the nation. To display to
France, and to the world, his desire of peace, and to leave
no mineans unattempted to preserve it, the president resolved
to institute another and more solemn missionr. General
Pinkney, John Marshall, and Elbridge Gerry, were accordingly appointed envoys to the French republic, and were
instructed, as the first had before been, to seek a reconciliation as the representatives of a people dreading war
much, but the sacrifice of honor more.
3. These also the directory refused to receive. They
wvere, however, addressed by persons verb)ally instructed5
by Talleyrand, the minister of foreign relations, to make
them proposals. In explicit terms, these unofficial agents
demanded a large sum of money before any negotiation
could be opened. To this insulting demand, a decided
nIegative was given.  A compliance w%as nevertheless
repeatedly urged, until at length the envoys reftused to
hold with them any further communication. After remaining several months at Paris, pressing in vain to be
received and heard, two, who were federalists, were ordered
to leave France, but Mr. Gerry, who was a republican.
was permTnitted to remain, and was invited singly to entorinto discussions relating to the commencement of a nego.
tiation.
4. When these events were klnown in the Uniteld States,
they excited general indignation. The spirit of party appeared to be extinct.' "Millions for defence, not a cent fbr
tribute," resounded from every quarter of the union. The
treaty of alliance with France was declared by conlgress
to be no longer in- force. Authority was given for captur.
ing armed French vessels. Provision-was made for raising
immedibately a small regular army; and, in case events
should render it expedient, for augmrenting it. A direct
tax andl addlitional internal duties were laid.
5. To command the armies of the United States, president Adams, with the-unanimous advice of the senate
appointed George Washington. I-Ie consented, but with
great reluctance, to accept the office, declaring, however,
that he cordially approved the measures of the government.
6. No opportunity was presented:of testinig the courage
and skill of the American troops. At sea, a desperate
actionII was fought between the frioate Constellation, of 38
guns, commanded by commodore Truxton, and the French
frigate L'Insurgente, of 4(0 guns. The latter, although of
superior force, was captured. The same intrepid officer,
in a subsequent action, compelled another French frigate
of 50 guns, to strike her colors, but she afterwards escaped
in the night.
7. The United States, in arms at home and victorious
on the ocean, comimanrded the respect of their-enemy.
The directory made overtures of peace. The president
immediately appointed ministers, who, on their:arrival at
Paris, foutnd the executive authority in the possession of
Bonaparte as first consul. They were promptly accredited,
and in September, 1800, a treaty was concluded satisfactory to both countries.               -
8. While this negotiation was in progress, the whole
American people were overshadowed with gloom, by the
sudden deathl of the FATHER of his country. On the 14th
of December, 1799, after an illness of one day only, general
Washington expired. Intelligence of this event, as it
rapidly spread, produced spontaneous, deep, and unaffected
grief, suspending every other thought, and absorbing every
different feeling.  
9.: Congress, then in session at Philadelphia, immediately adjourned.- On assembling the next day, the house
of representatives resolved, "that the speaker's chaii
238'
[1800.
ADAMS'Sshould be shrouded in black, and the members wear black
during the session; and that a joint committee should be
appointed to devise the most suitable manner of paying
honor to the memory of the MAN first in war, first in
peace, and first in the hearts of his country-mene."
10. The senate, on this melancholy occasion, addressed
a letter of condolence to the president of the United States.'This event," they observe, "so distressing to all our
fellow citizens, mrust be particutlarly heavy to you, who
have long been associated with him in deeds of patriotism.
Permit us, sir, to mingle our tears with yours. On this
occasion it is manly to weep. To lose such a mant, at
such a crisis, is no common calamity to the world. Our
country moiurns a father. The Almighlity Disposer of
human events has taken from us our greatest benefactor
and ornament. It beciomes us to submit with reverence
to HIM -who maklieth darkness his pavilion.

coiuntries wvho have been pre-eminent in fame. Ancient
and modern names are diminished before him. Greatness
and guilt have too often been allied; but his fame is whiter
than it is brilliant. The destroyers of nations stood abashed
at the majesty of his virtues. It reproved the intemperance
of their ambition, and darkened the spleiidor of victory.
12. " Such was the man whom we deplore. Thanks to
God, his glory is consummated. Washington yet ]ives on
earth in his spotless example--his spirit is in heaven. Let
his countrymen consecrate the mremory of the heroic general, the patriotic statesman, and the virtuous sage: let
them teach their children never to forget that the fruits
of his labors, and of his example, are their inheritance."
13. Agreeably to the report of the committee, and the
unanimous resolves of congress, a funeral procession moved
fiom the legislative hall to the German Lutheran church,
where an oration was delivered by general Lee, a representative from Virginia. The procession was grand anDA
solemn, the oration impressive and eloquent. Throughout
the union similar marks of affliction vwere exhibited. A
whole bereaved people appeared in mourning. In every
part of the republic, funeral orations were delivered, and
the best talents of the nation were devoted to an expression
of the nation's grief.

ADMINISTRATION.44. The parliament, irritated by this coliduct of the
Virginians, sent Sir George Ayscue, in 1652, with a powerful fleet, to reduce them to submission. Berkeley, with
more spirit than prudence, opposed this force; but after
making a gallant resistance, he was obliged to yield. He
obtained the mrost favorable terms for the colony, but asked no stipulations in his owIIn tvor. Withdrawing to a
retired situation, he lived beloved and respected by the
people.
45. For niniie years afterwards, governors appointed by
Cromwell, continued to preside over the colony. But the
predilection for royalty, which the inhabitants had displayed, was, remembered, and they were less favored than
those of New-England, who, like the predominal-t party
in Great Britain, were republicans in politics, and puritans
in religion. A.bitrary restrictions upon the commerce of
Virginia checked its prosperity, and produced discontent.
At length, the sudden death of governor Matthews afforded, to the adherents of the royal cause, a favorable opportunity, which they. gladly seized, to proclaim Charles II,
and to invite Berkeley to resume the authority of governor. IHe consented, requiring only their solemn promise
to hazard their lives and fortunes in supporting the cause
they had espoused.
46. At this period, no intelligence had been received of
the death of Cromwell. Fortunately for the colony, that
event happened soon after; the king whom they had pro.
claimed was restored to the throne; and- Virginia for a long
time boasted, that she was the last of the British dominions that submitted to Cromwell, and the first that returned to her allegiance.
47. Charles II confirmed Sir William Berkeley in
the office of governor; but with characteristic ingratitude, he neglected the interests of the colony, and even
imposed additional restrictions upon its commerce. He
also granted to his favorites large tracts of land which
belonged to the colony. These injuries, inflicted by a
hand which ought to have bestowed favors, wounded the
feelings of the Virginians, and produced murmurs and coinplaints. No relief being granted, an open and turbulent
insurrection was the consequence.
48. At the head of the insurgents was Nathaniel Bacon.
He was a lawyer, educated in London, and was appointed
a member of the council, a short time after his emigration
to Virginia. He was young, bild, ambitious; his person

From the time of the adoption of the cofstitution, the
republican party had been gradually inocreasirng t rtumbers.'The two parties bi4rg now n'early,equal1 the prospect of
success inspired both with uncommoni   ardor. The federalists supported Mr. Adams an(l general Pinkney; the
republicans, Mr. Jefferson and colonel Burr.  Ilie two
latter received a small majority od the eTectora} votes  
and as they received also an equal numiber, thie selection

of course, vice-lPresident.
16. The caiuses NhTich rendered Mr, Adams utn'rp)uaI
and led to a claritre in the administiration were, his appareut coldness towards the French revolution; the charge thant
the tfederalists generally were p,rtial to Great Britain; the
expenditure of mon,y for building a navy and for other purpos.s alleged to be impolitic or useless; the enactment of
the alien law, by which the president was authorized to
compel st.spected foreigners to leave the country, and of the
sedition law which provided that the authors and publishers of false and malicious accusations against the president
and members of congress should be prosecuted and pulnished. But more effectual thami these was the chlarge that
Mr. Adams, and the party which supported him, entertained political opinions less favorable to liberty than those of
the party which opposed him.-By deserting a man so distinguished as Mr. Adams for his talents, for his experience
in political affairs, and for the important services which
hie had rendered to his cotuntry in the revolutionary strmggle, the people showed how jealous they were of the
liberty they had obtained, anid how firmly they were
determined to guard it from even tnossible danLger.17. The control of the government being now transferred to the republican party, they, at the next session of
congress, repealed, after a long and eloquent debate, a
law altering the judicial system, which had been passed
at the close of Mr. Adams's administration. This repeal
annihilated the offices of sixteen judges; who had just
been appointed. At the sanie session, the internal Zduties
were also abolished.
18. A second census of the people, referring to' 1800,
was com-pleted in 1801. They amounted to 5,319,762,
having in ten years increased nearly one million four hun(Ired tlhousand. In the same number of years the exports
increased from nineteen to ninety-four millions, and the
revenue from 4,771,000 tol2,945,000 dollars!:This rapid
advance in the career of prpsperity has no parallel'-in the
history of nations, and is to be attributed principally to the
institutions of the coiintry, which, securing equal privileges to all, give to the enterprise and industry of al],
free scope and full encouragement.
19. In -1802, the state of Ohio was admitted into the
union. It was formeriy a portion of the Northwestern
Territory, for the governent of which, in 1787, ant ordinance was passe(d, by the continental'congress. With
commendable foresight they provided that slavery, the
soneirce of weakness, of-poverty, and of crime, should
never exist in that extensive and fertile region.' Thisis
doubtless one of the causes of the unparalleled rapidity of
its poputlation. In thirty years from its first settlement,
the number of its inhabitanits exceeded half a million.
T''he state of Tennesee, which was previously a part of
North-Carolina, and lies between that state and the river
Mississippi, was admitted in 1796.
20. The right of deposit at New-Orleans, conceded to
thle citizensof the Uniited'States by Spain, and necessary
to the people of the western country, had, until:this period, been freely enjoyed. In October, the chief officer of
that city, prohibited the exercise of it in future.'this
violatibn of a solemn engagement produced, throughout
the states of' Ohio and' Kentucky, indignant clamor and
violent commotion. In congress, a proposition was made
to take possession, by force, of the whole province of
Louisiana, and the injured people of the west were eager
for permission to avenge their Wrongs, and to regain their
rights, by the sword.
21. A more pacifie course was adlopted. Knowing

to Faiae, the president instituted a negotiation to acquire
it by purchase. In April, 1803, a treaty was concluded,
eonveying it to the United States for fifteen millions of
dollars.
i2. The territory thus added to th  national domain,
was first discovered by the French, who, in 1699, began a
settlement within its limits, It continued a colony of
that nation until 1762, when it was ceded to Spain.- In
her possessioc it remained, slowly increasing in popularion, gtil October, 18000 when it was retrceded tu)
France, and by her was afterwards, as has been related,
transferred to the United States  The i habitants, a
mixture of French and Spaniards, were not numerous.
Its boundaries have never been definedl. iThey embrace,
at a moderate estimation, a territory more etensive than
some of the most powerful European kingdoms, and in
many parts the soil is exceedingly fertile, Its acquisition
was considered, by the United States, of the greatest
importance, as it gave them the entire control of a river,
wihich is one of the noblest in the world,
23. Since the year 1801, wvar had existed between the
United States and Tripoli, one of tihe states of Barbary,
situated on the coast of the Mediterranean. No mnenotable event occurred until 1803, when a large squadron,
under the commuand of co[mmodore Preble, was despatched
into that sea. On arriving before Tripoli, captai Blain.
bridge, in the frigate Philadelpliia, of 44 guns, w is sent
into the harbor to reconnoitre. While in eager pursuit of
a small vessel, he unfortunately advanced so far that the
frigate grounded, and all attempts to remove her were in
svain. T'rhe sea around her was immediately covered with
Tripolitan gun-boats, tand captain Bainbridge was co:npelled to surrender. The officers were considered as pris*
oners of war; but the crew, according to the custesi of
Barbary, were treated as slaves.
24. At the capture of this frigate, the enemy rej iced
and exulted beyond measure. Lieutenant Stephen Decatur conceived the design of retaking or destroying her.
Commodore Preble, applauding the spirit of the youthful
hero, granted hiha permission to make the attempt. In
February, 1804, he sailed from Syracuse, in a small
ichooner, having on board but seventy-six men, entered
undiscovered the harbor of Tripoli, and advancing boldly
took a station alongside the frigate. perTceiving the Ceg~g
mE ERtSOl'-sin consternation, Decatur sprang on'board, his men fol
lowed, and with' drawn swords rushed upon the enemy.
The decks were soon cleared, some being killed, and
others driven into the sea.25. A heavy cannonade upon the frigate, from the
oatteries on shore and the corsairs near, was now cominenced, and several vessels of war were seen approaching. She was set on fire and abandoned, none of the
party being killed and but four wounded.'~ Throughout
all the piratical states, this brilliant exploit exalted the
reputation of the American arms., The president, in
reward of his address and bravery, promoted lieutenant
Decatur to the rank of post-captain in the navy.  
-26. While the squadron remained before Tripoli, other
deeds of heroism were performed, evincing a love of fame
and a devotion to country unsurpassed in Grecian or
Rotnan story.- The events anid operations of this war
shed a lustre upon the American name, gave experience
anld character to tlhe,fficers,- and prepared them to acquire
greater glory in a contest with a nobler foe. VThey were
equialled lhowever, by an enterprise on land, bold and
rolmantic i- its conception, and exhibiting, in its execution, uncommon address and decision of character.
27. William Eaton who: had been a captain in the
American army, was, at the'commnencement of this war,
consul at Tunis.   ie there became acquainted with
Hamet Caramanly, whom a younger brother had excluded
from the throne of Tripoli. With" him he concerted an
expedition against the reigning sovereign,- and returned(
to the United States to obtain permission and the means
to undertake it. Permission was granted, the co-operation of the squadron recommended, and- such pecuniary
assistance as could be spared was afforded.
28. To raise an army in Egypt, and lead it to attack
the usurper in his dominions, was the project which had
been concerted. In the beginning of 1805,' Eaton met
Hamet at Alexandria, and was appointed general of his
forces. On the 6th of March, at the head-of a respectable body of mounted Arabs, and about -seventy Christians,
he set out for Tripoli. His roiute lay across a desert one
thousand miles in extent. On his march, he encountered
peril, fatigue, and suffering, the description of which
would resemble the exaggerations of romance. On the
25th of April, having been fifty days on the march, he
a-rived berore Derne, a Tripolitan city on the Mediterra-143

r805.]nean, and found in the harbor a part.of the American
squadron, destined to assist him. He learnt also that the
usurper, havrig. received notice of his approach, had
raised a considerable army and was -then withili a day's
march of the city.
29. No timne was therefore to be lost. The next morning he sulnmoned the governor to surrender, who returned
for answer, "My head or yours." The city was assaulted,
and after'a contest.of, two hours and a half, possession
g ained. The Christians suffered severely and the general
was slightly wouinded. Great exertions were immediately
made to fortify the city. On tlie 8th of May, it was attacked by the. T'ripolitan army. -Although tenwtiimes more
numerous than:Eaton's band, the assailants, after persisting four -hours iit the. attempt, were compelled to
retire. On the 10th of June another battle was fought,
in which the einemy were defeated. T'he next. day the
American frigate Constitution arrived in the. harbor,
which so terrified the Tripolitans- that they fled precipitately to the desert.
-30. The frigate came,, however, to arrest the olperations
of Eaton, in the midst of his brilliant and successful
career. Alarmed at his progress, thie reigning bashaw had
offered terms of peace, which, being much more favorable
than had before been offered, were accepted by Mr. LIear,
the authorised agent of the government.. Sixty thousand
dollars were given as a ransom for the unfortunate American prisoners, and an engagement wasrmade to withdraw
all support from Hlamnlet. The nation, proud of the exploits of Eaton, regretted this diplomatic interference, but
the treaty was ratified by the president and -seiate; and
thus ended the war in the Mediterranean.
31. Colonel Burr, having lost the confidence of the republican party, became, in 1804, a candidate for the office
of governor of New-York: the'federalists generally gave
him their votes, but Mr. Hamilton, considering him an
unprincipled politician, openly-opposed his election. The
choice fell upon the rival candidate.  A duel ensued
between these distinguished individuals, the chllenge
proceeding from Burr. Hamilton was mortally wounded.
This event produced: a strong and lively sensation througli.
out the union. At the next presidential election, which
occurred in the same year Mr. Jefferson was elected presdent, and George Clinton of New-York, vice-president,
the for mer receiving al but fourteen votes.
244
JEFFERSON'S.[180632. Burr, notwithstanding- his brilliant talents, now
Sunk, for a time, into merited obscurity. His future conduct showed, however, that, while unobserved by his fellow citizens, he had not been idle. In the autumn of 1806,
his movements in the western country attracted the notice
of government. He had purchased and was building boats
on the Ohio, anu engaging mene to descend that river.
[His declared purpose was to formnr a settlement on the
bank, of the Washita, in Louisiana;- but the character of
the man, the nature of his preparations, and the?incautious
disclosures of his associates, led to-thesuspicion that his
true object was either to gain possession of New-Orleans,
and erect into a separate gcvernment the country watered
by the Mississippi and its branches, or to invade, from the
territories ot the United States, thie rich Spanish province of Mtexico.
33. From the first moment of suspicion, he was closely
watched by the agents of the government. At Natchez,
while on his way to New-Orleans, he was cited to appear
before the supreme court of the Mississippi Territory. But
lie had so envelo'ped his projects in secrecy, that sufficient
evidence to convict him could not be produced, and he was.
discharged. Hearing, however, that several persons, sus-.
pected of being his accomplices, had been arrested at NewOrleans an'd elsewhere, he fled in disguise from-Natchez,
was apprehended on the Tombigbee, and conveyed a prisoner to Richmond. Two indictments were found against
him, one charging him with treason against the United
States, the other with preparing and commencing an expedition against the dominions of Spain.
34. In August, 1807, he was tried, upon those indictments, before=John Marshall, the chief justice of the
United States. Full. evidence- of his guilt'notbeing exhibited, he was acquitted by the jury. The people, how-.
ever, believed him guilty; and by their desertion'and
contempt, he was reduced to a conditionof the most abject
wretchedness.' The ease with which his plans were defeated, demonstrated the strength of the government, andhis
fate will ever be an impressive warning to those who, in a
free country, listen to the suggestions of criminal ambition.
35. The wars produced by:the French revolition contiinued to rage in Eutrope. Tlhe attempts, made.by the
neighboring kings, to c-mpel republican France to resume
her monarchical institutions, had.not only been resisted
aiddefeated by her indignant citizens, but tney had fol

24lowed home the repelled invaders of their country, and
had subdued those who began the war with the hope and
purpose of subduing France. The nation had necessarily
become 6a nation of soldieXs, and one, more daring and fortunate than the others, had been placed at their head as
chief of the republic. By his extraordinary talents, and
the vast means subjected to his single will, he:acquired
control over most of the- European kingdomsi.
36. England, however, unsubdued and undaunted, had
become as pre-eminent on the water as France on the lalnd.
Her powerful navy expelled every hostile navy from the
ocean, and rode triumphant in every sea.. America profit.
ted from the destruction of the ships -and commerce of
other nations. Being neutral, her vessels carried from
port to port the productions of France and her dependant
kingdoms; and also to the ports of those:kingdoms the
manufactures of England. Few ships were found on- the
ocean except those of the United States and Great Britain.
37. The latter, having always found it impossible to
man her numerous fleets, by voluntary enlistments, had
been accustomed to-resort to impressment, or seizing by
force her subjects and compelling them to serve, as sailors,
on board her ships of war. Soon afterithe:peace of 1783,
she claimed a right to search for and seize them, even on
board of neutral vessels while traversing the ocean. In
the exercise of this pretended right, citizens of the United
States, sometimes by mnistake and sometimes by design,
were, seized, dragged from their friends, transported to
distant parts of the world, compelled to perform:the degrading duty of British sailors, and to fight with nations at
peace with their own. Against this outrage upon personal
liberty and the rights of American citizens, Vashington,
Adams, and;Jefferson had remonstrated in vain. The
abuse continued, and every year added to its enormity,
until a feeling of resentment was aroused worthy the best
period of the Roman republic.,
38. But not in this mode only.were the rights of the
United States invaded and their interest sacrificed on.the
ocean. The carrying trade afforded a harvesttoo rich, and
too tempting to British cupidity, to be long enjoyed unmolested. American ships, carrying to. Europe the produce
of French colonies, were, in an early stage of the' war,
captured by British cruisers, ani] condemned -by their
courts as lawful-prizes. Several European ports under
the control of France, were declared, by British orders in

40.- hii June, 18-01, an event occurred, which for a timec
concentrated- uipon one of thte riVal naLtionis the whole

a'scertained-to be, that three of them were citizens of tlie

41. Thtis insolent attack upon a nationatl shlip,-thist

officer, the hostile feelings which had'been excited began
to subside; but delaying to render satisfaction, and refusing
to adopt adequate measures to prevent a continuance of
aggression, they were not extinguished nor appeased.
43. -Bonaparte having declared his purpose of. etiforCing
with rigor the Berlin decree; the British government having solemnly asserted the right of search an(l impressmelt,
and:having intimated-their irttention to adopt measures in
retaliation of the French decree, the president recommended to congress that the seamen, ships, and -merchandise
of the United States should be detained in port to preserve
them /from the.dangers which threatened them on- tle
ocean.. A law laying an. indefinite.embargo was-in consequence enacted. A hope to coerce the belligerent. powers
to. return to the ohservance of the lawsgof nations, by
depriving them of tlhe benefits derived from the trade of
America,. was doubtless a concurriig motive for passing
the law'
44. A few days only had elap.sed, when information was
received, that Great Britain had prohibited neutrals, except
upon the degrading condition of paying a tax or tribute to
her, from trading with Fran'ae orher allies, comriprising
nearly every maritime nation of Europe. This was followed, in.a few weeks, by a decree issued by., Bonaparte,
at Milan, declaring that every neutral vessel, which should
subrmit to be visited by a British ship, or to pay the tribute
demanded, should be confiscated, if aftenrwards found in
his ports, or taken by hlis crutisers. Thus, at the date O~f
the embargo, were'orders and decrees in existence.rendering liable to capture alniost every American vessel. sailing
on the ocean.
45. In! the New-England states, the embargo, withholding the merchant from a career in whlich he had been
highly prosperous, and in which. he imagined that he night
still. be favored of fortune, occasioned discontent and'clamor. The. federalists, more numerous there than in
any other part o.f the union, pronounced it a measure unwise and oppressive. These representations, and the real
and severe distress which the people endured, produced a
rapid change in their political opinions. In a short time,
a./majority became federalists, and opposed withi zeal all
the measures of the government.
46. In the fall of 180S, a new election of ch-ief-maglstrate
took place. Mr. Jefferson, believing that.:no person should
thold that o0ice more than eiglt yearas and desirous 9f

confirming the example of Washington, had previously an.
nounced his intention to retire to-private life. Jamries Madison was elected president andGeorgeClinton vice-president.
47. In March, 1809,-congress repealed the embargo,
and substituted a law prohibiting all intercourse with
France and Great- Britain.  Bonaparte, in retaliation,
issued a decree, at Rambouillet,: directing that all American vessels,- which were then. in the ports of France or
might afterwards enter, should be seized and confiscated.
48. In the nonintercourse law, a provision was inserted,
that if either nation should revoke her hostile edicts, and
the president should announce-that fact by proclamation,
then the law should cease:to be in -force in regard to the
nation so revoking. ln April, Mr. Erskine, the British
minister.at Washington, engaged, on the part of his govern.
ment, that the orders in council, so far as they affected
the United States, should be withdrawn on the 10th of
June.; and the-president immediately issued the proclama-:tion prescribed in the law.     -
49. This arrangement the British ministry refused to
ratify, declaringthat Mr. Erskine had no-authority to make
it. Recalling -him, they appointed Mr. Jackson his successor. In a correspondence betweenr this gentleman and
the secretary of: state, the former insinruated that the
American government knew that Mr. Erskine was not
authorized: to make the arrangement,:and knew of course
that it would not be binding on G(;reat Britain. This
insinuation was distinctly denied by the secretary, but
was subsequently repeated, in al offensive manner, by Mr.
Jackson. He was immediately informed, that, op account
of his indecorous conduct, no other comnmunications from
him would he received. He was shortly afterwards recalled by his government.
50. The noninterco,trse law expired in May, 1810, when
a proposition was made equally to both belligerents, thai
if either would revoke its hostile edicts, that law should
be revived and enforced against the other.' In August,
Bonaparte, by his minister of state, assured Mr. Armstrong, the American -envoy to France, that the Berlin
and Milan decrees were revoked, the revocation to take
effect on the first day- of November ensuing. Confiding
in this assurance, the president, on the second day of
November, issued his proclamation, declaring that all
intercourse with Great Britain was prohibited, and that
an unres.trainued commerce with France. was allowed.engaging, and his elocution commanding. He harangued
the citizens upon their grievances; inflamed their resentment against their rulers; declaimed particularly against
the languor with which the war, then existing with the
Indians, had been conducted; and such was the effect of his
representations, that he was elected general by the people.
4". He applied to the governor for a cornmmission confirming this election, and offered instantly to march, at the
head of the citizens, against the savages. Sir William
indignantly refused, and issued a proclamation commanding the insurgents to disperse. Bacon had advanced too
far to recede with honor or safety. He hastened, at the
head of six hundred armed followers, to Jamestown, surrounded the house where the governor and council were
assembled, and repeated his demanld.
50. The council, intimidated by the threats of the enraged multitude, hastily prepared a commission, and, by
their entreaties, prevailed on the governor tosign it. Bacon and his troops, then began their march against the
Indians. But the council, when relieved from their fears,
declared the commission void, and proclaimed him a rebel.
Enraged at this conduct, he instantly returned, with all
his forces, to Jamestown. The governor fled, the council
dispersed, and he found himnself in possession of supreme
power. To give it somne show of legality, he called togethier the most considerable gentlemen in the colony, who
hound themselv~es by oath to support his authority.
51. Some districts remained faithful to Berkeley, who
collected forces, and made inroads into those sections
where Bacon's authority was recognised. The latter retaliated, and for some months, a civil war, with all its
peculiar horrors, raged in Virginia. Jamestown was burned,
and some of the finest and best cultivated districts were
laid waste.
52. King Charles, informed of the situation of affaiks,
despatched a body of troops to the assistance of Berkeley.
Bacon and his followers, unintimidated by their approach,
determined to oppose them; but when prepared to take
-the field, this daring and successful leader, having exercised the supreme power for. seven months, sickened and
-died; and no person being found among the insurgents
qualified to supply his place, as the genieral of an army or
as a popular leader, they laid down their arms and dis.
*persed.
53. Governor Berkeley again assumed the supreme.. I VIRGINIA.
9~
AJ551. Great Britain having expressed a willingness to
repeal her orders whenever France should repeal her de.
crees, she was now called upon, by the American envoy,
to fulfil her engagement. - She objected, that the French
decrees could not he considered as repealed, a letter frotx
the minister of state not being, for that purpose, a docl
ment of sufficient authority. In answer to this objection,
proof was presented that the French admiralty courts
considered them repealed, and that no American vessef,
although many had entered the ports of France, had been
subjected to their provisions. Great Britain, however,
still persisted to enforce her orders..
52. For this purpose, she had. stationed ships of war
before the principle harbors of the United States. All
American merchantmen, departing or returning, were
bearded, searched, and many of them sent to British ports~
as legal prizes. Impressments too were frequent, and the
British officers, entertaining exalted ideas of their nat-al
strength, and holding in contempt the republican flag,
exhibited, on all occasions, an extreme insolence of behavior, which nations as well as individuals expose thlemselves to incur, by long and patient endurance of insult and
aggression.
53. In one instance, however, their insolence was (ldeservedly punished. - Comnmodore Rogers, sailing in the
frigate President, met, in the evening, a vessel on tlhe
coast of Virginia. He hailed, but instead of receiving an
answer, was hailed in turn, and a shlot was fired which
struck, the mainmast of the President.  The fire w.as
instantly returned by the commodore, and continued for a
few minutes, when, finding his antagonist was of inferior
force and that her guns were almost-silenced, he desisted.
On hailing again, an answer was given, that the ship was
the British sloop of war Little Belt, of 18 guns. Thirty.
two of her men weie killed and wrounded, and the ship
was muchli disabled.
54. Mr. Foster, successor to Mr. J.Tackson, arrived at'Washington in the summler of 1811, and proposed terrnms,of reparation for the attack on the Chesapeake. These
were a formal disavowal of the act, restoration to the
frigate of the surviving sailors taken from it, a pecuniary
provision for those who were wounded, and for the farnilies of those who were killed. These terms were accepted by the president.
55. But the British envoy could give no assurance that
MADiSON'S
[1il I.his government was disposed to make a satisfactory
arrangement of the subject of impressment, or to repeal
the orders in council. These orders, on the contrary,
continued to be eRforced with rigor; and on the restoration
of a free commerce with France, a large number of Ameri-,can vessels, laden with rich cargoes, and destined to her
ports, fell into the power of British cruisers. Such was
now the state of affairs, that the United States suffered
-'he evils of war, while great Britain enjoyed the advantages. i Her cruisers, since 1803, had captured nine
hundred American vessels.  
-56. The patience of the nation was exhausted. President Madison, early in November, 1811, called congress
together, laid before them the state of fore.gn relations,
and recommended that the republic should be placed in ali
attitude to maintain, by force, its wounded honor and
essential interests. The representatives of the people,
whose sentiments and feelings they expressed, determined
to act in accordance with the views of the president.
57. Laws were enacted providing for the increase of
the regular army to 35,000 men; for the augmentation of
the naval establishment; empowering the president to
accept of the services of volunteers, to make a detachment from the militia, and to borrow eleven millions of
dollars.  It was the expectation of many that Great
Britain, witnessing these seriouspreparations, would recede from the stand she had taken.
58. Events, however, occurred, while congress were in
session, which considerably diminished this expectatiojn.
For several years, the Indian tribes residing near the
remote lakes and the sources of the Mississippi, had displayed symptoms of hostility, murdering a number of
whites and robbing others of their property. In tlie fall
of 1811, general Harrison, with a small force, was sen'
into their territories, instructed to negotiate if possible
but to fight if necessary. On the 6th of November, h
arrived at Tippecanoe, their principal town, where he wrs
met by Indian messengers, with whom an agreementwas
made, that hostilities should not take place before the next
morning, and that then an amicable conference should be
held.
59. -Just before daybreak, the savages, in violationof
their engagement, made a sudden and furious attack upon
the troops in their encampment. Nothing but the precaution of sleeping in order of battle, dn their arms, saved

181;1.]them from total defeat. A dreadfuli slaughter was made;
tit the savages wvere finally repuilsed, dispersed, and their
-.own laid waste. A strong belief was entertained, founded
ipon credible testimonly, that: they- had been incited to
lostility by British agents stationed-among them.
60. In February, 1812, John! Henry, who had once resided in Canada, -commnunicated to the president the fact
that in 1809, he had been employed by the governor of
that province,e upon a secret mission -to. Boston, the
nmetropolis of the New-England states; an- that he was
instructed to confer with the disaffected, UponI the subject
of a separation of those states from the union, and their
forming a political connection with Great Britain. HIe
exhibited documents in support of his disclosures, which
he wvas led to make, by the neglect of-his-employer to reward him for his serviees. It did not appear that he had
succeeded in icorrupting the fidelity of any individual; but
the attempt, in a time of peace, and in the midst of: the
most amicable professions, not only preserved in full force
but increased the previous irritation.,
61. Congress continued to be employed until the 20th
of May, in making preparations for war, still cherishing the
hope that a chlange of policy in Europe would( rend(ler unnecessary an appeal to arms. On that day, the Hornet
arrived fromn London, bringing information that no prospect
existed of a favorable change. On the first of June, the
president.setit a message to congress, recounting the
wrongs received from Great Britain, and submnitting the
question whether the. United States should continue to
endure them or-resort to war?
62. The miessage was considered with closed doors.
On the 18th, an act was passed declaring -war agailst
Great Britain. The measure -was decidedly condemned
by a conrsiderable portioiin of the citizens, among whomn
were many honest and able men. Exercising the undoubted
privilege ot' freenien, they exanined, with the severest
scrutiny, the measures and motives of the administiration.
They asserted that the war was unnecessary, partial, and
unwise: that it was unnecessary, because, in their opinion,
a satisfactory adliustment of all disputes miglht have been
obtained by farth'er negotiation: that it was partial, becl  *1ye

CHAPTER XXVL.;
CAMPAIGN OF 1812.''1Eo people of the United States remembered, with
lpri(le, the patriotism and bravery exhibited by their army
in thile revolutionary war. A long period of peace and prosperity had increased their confidence in their own strength
tand the belief was generally entertained, that victory over
the same foe would now be so much the more certainly
and easily gained, as the nation was more rich and populous. They did not reflect, that peace-had impaired the
military energies of the republic, while their enemy, by
constant exercise in arms, had acquired, not only additional
strength, but greater skill to use and apply it.
2.- i!rom the veteran officers, who had acquired famne- in
the former conflict, a selection was -made to fill the principal posts in the new army. HIlenry Dearborn, of Massachusetts, was appointed major-general and commander-inchlief. He was at the battie of BLunklier's hill. In the expedition against Quebec, he served as a captain under Arnold. He distinguished himself on these and other occasions; and at the close of the war bore the commission of
colonel. He held, for a long time, the office of secretary
of war, and discharged its duties with exemplary industry
and skill. Thomas-Pinkney, of South-Carolina, was a]so
appointed major-general.  Among the brigadiers were
Witlkinson, Hull, Hampton, and Bloomfield.
3. At the time of the delaration of war, general Hull
was also governor of the Michigan territory, of which
Detroit is the capital.] On the 12th of July, with two
thousand regulars and volunteers, he crossed the river dividing the United States from Canada. On the same day,
he addressed a proclamation to the- Canadians, tendering

to attack Malden, and thence proceed to Montreal.

ous delay. Distrust and: contempt expelled confidence aind
attachment from the breasts of the Canadians. The ardor of the troops began to cool. Malden was reinforced;
and at this critical moment, informniation was received that
Mackiniaw, an American post above Detroit, had surrendered to a large body of British and Indians, who were
rusling down the river in numbers stufficient to overwhelm
the American forces. Panie struck, general Hull hastened back to Detroit.
5. General Brock, the commander at Maiden, pursued
him, with a tfiorce superior in number, but composed of
militia and Indians. On the 14th of August, he erected
batteries opposite Detroit. The next day, lie began a cannonade upon tlhe American fortifications which was returned with precision and effect. On the 16th, the enemy crossed the river, taking post about three miles abbve
the city. Meeting with ns resistance, and hearing that
some. of the American troops were absent, general Brock
resolved to march directly foirward and assault the fort.
6. The troops, cool and undaunted, awaited ingood order
the approach of the enemy, anticipating an easy victory.
Tothe astonishlment of all,general Hull forbade the artillery
to fire, and hung out a white flag in token of a wish to
capitulate. A. correspondence between the two. generals
was immediately-opened, which ended in the surrender of
the army and of the territory of Michigan..  -
7. It is irapossible to describe the indignation of the
soldiers and citizens, when they saw themselves delivered,
by the authority of one man, into the power of an enemy
whom they supposed:they might easily have conquered.
Many believed him either a traitor or coward.. An event
so disgraceful, occurring in a quarter whiere success was
confidently anticipated, caused throughout the union thle
greatest mortification and amazement. Stung by disappointment, all united in censuring general Hull. His
greatest, perhaps his only fault, was want of decision and
energy..
-8. The people of Ohio and Kentucky were alarmedADAMINISTRA1TION.
Nearly ten thiousand citizens made a tender of their services, and a part of them, placed under the commnand of
general Williamn H. Harrison, marched towards the territory of Michigan.  But - great and numerouis were the
difficulties enc;~uatered; the volunteers were anwilling to
submnit to the wholesome restraints of disci~line; and
wxviater arrived before any important undertaking could he,
accomplished. Several incursions were made into the
country of the savages, w ho, instigated by British agents,
and by a celebrated Indian prophlet, anid coinnanded by'recumseh, a- gallant varrior, hlad become almost universally
hostile.
9. For the purpose of iiividirig (Canada, in another quarter, an army of regu!ars nad militia were assemnbled on
the northern frontier (if New-York. It was far less numierouts than the government had anticipated, So happy
was tlhe eoIditionI ol' even the poorest class of American
citizens, that but teNv could be indliied to enlist as soldiers.
Anil in sonme of the states the phtlausible doctrine was maintained, that the officers of the gon"rq'al government have
n) power over thI mnilitia, until (called into service and
corisigne)d to their aut hority, by the state executive, and
that even then they caltnnotl b)e cominpelled to march beyond

and thuis dimininiiished the anmount of oine species of fioree
iupon ~which tile generial government hai d relied.
10. General Van Rensselaer, ot thle New-York militia,
he i.g the senior officler on that frontie r, had the commiand
of these troops, which were called the army of the centre.
I-is headquarters were at Lewistown. otr the river Niagara
and on the opposite side was Queenstown, a fortified British
post. The miilitia displayinig great eagerness to be led
against the enemy, the general determined to cross ovem
to Queenstown. The first attempt was defeated by tern
pestuons weather.'On the 13th of October. a party, led
by colonel Van Rensselaer, effected a landing, although
opposed by a British force sta:tioned on the bank. The
colonel was severely wonlided, bit the troops, unlider captains Ogilvie and Wool, advanced to storm the fort. They
gained possession, but, at'the moment of success, general
Brock arrived, from a neighboring post, with a reinforce.
ment of six hundred men. These, although the most nu-.
merous, were gallantly driven back by the American troops,
[p attempting to rally them, general Bro6k was killed,'
18l.]I 1. General Van Rensselaer wlho had previoIIusly crossed
over, now returned to hasten the embarkation of the rear
division. Those who had latelyv shown such eagerness to
meet the enemy, now utterly refused to pass beyond tlhe
national bolndary. He entreated and remonstiated, but
in vain. - Meanwhile the enemy, having re ceived anothei
reinforcement, advanced to attack-'thie Americans in the
fort. A desperate and bloody conflict ensued, of wlitcl
the militia were calm spectators. Inr the enid, the Britist
were completely victorio(us. Of o0ne thlousand men, wh1(
c(rossed inito Canada, but few effected their escape.
12. Soon after, general Van Rensselaer retire(l from th(
service anid was succeeded by general Alexander Smyth,
of Virginia. In a turgid address to the "Men of New
\ork,1 he announced tilat, in.a lfew days, he should plaint
the American standard in Canada, and invited themi to
share in the danger and glory of the enterprise. His force
was increased, by those who obeyed his call, to 4500 m~en.
Ttie norning of the 28th-of Novenmber was assig'ned as
the- time for crossing. So tardy were the movemnent. of
the troops, thsn until afternoon, the first division, was not
ready to leave the American shore(,. The enelny appear.d
in force on the opposite tarnkl; a couln il of oileers decided
that it was inexpedienit at that timre to cross,; and the
troops were ordered to tLhbark. They we're disappointed
and dissatisfied;but thelr clamor-N was apl)peased by the
assurance that another.attenil)t wolid speeielily be made.
13. The next day, they received or(ders to be in readiness to embark on the first of Decemlber. But theirfirst
disappointment had sensibly damped their ardor. At the
appdinted hour, the hoats were not reldy to move; and
when ready, but 1500 meni were found willing to cross.
A cotincil of war decided unanimously against proceeding,
and again the troops were ordered to debark. The pl]an
of invading Canada was abandoned for the season. The
olame of these faillires was attributed, by the soldiers, to
their commander; and so hilghly were they exasperated,
tiat, for several days, his life was in (langer fromn their filry
14. Trhe army of the north, which was under the immediate commapd of general Dearborn, was, stationed at
Greenbutsh, near Albany, and at Plattsburgh, on Lake
Champlain. From thl latter post, a detachment marched
a short distance into Canada, surprised a small body of
British and Indians, anrdL destroyed a considerable quantity

pected by the people; but after the misfortunes at Detroit
and Niagara, the general deemed it inexpedient to engage
in aily important enterprise.
15. Thus ended the campaign of 1812'. Although, on
many occasions~ extraordinary gallantry had been displayed, yet nothing was accompIished, and the losses
sustaiined were numerous and heavy. Those who approved
of the declaration of war felt disappointed, mortified, and
dejected. They attributed most of the misfortunes of
the country to the conduct of the federalists, whom they
accused of endeavoring to prevent enlistments into the
army, and of maintaining the mwost pernicious doctrines in
relation to the militia,'The federalists, on the other hand,
attribuited these repeated failures to the imrbecility of the
administration, and to the unwise selection of military
officers,  They assumed a bolder tonae of censure, and
evinriced a more deternined spirit of opposition.
i6. But whil, on lanci defeat and disgrace attended
the arms of the republic, on tre ocean, whiere the injutries
wlhiuh led to the war had )been inflicted, they gained a rich
harvest of vi,tory and gktorv,  Upon the declaration of
wars the American officers and seamen glowed with ardor
to avenge the sufferings of their impressed fellow-citizens,
and to vindicate the honor of the republican flag. Those
ships of wars whichl were ready for sea, immediately sailed
in search of the enemr,
17. On thle 19th of August, captain Hull, who com.
nianrided the Cons'tution of forty-four guns, descried a
British frigate. His crew, giving three cheers, requested
to be placed alongside of their antagonist.- For three
quarters of an hour, the -latter endeavored, by skilful
mancsuverihg, to obtain the advantage of position. Defeated in this, she advanced towards the Constitution,
firing broadsides at intervals. When she had approached
within half pistol shot, a trem-endous cannonade burst
upon her from the American frigate. In thirty minutes
every mast and nearly every spar being shot away, she
struck her flag.
18. Sfie was found to be the Guerriere, of thirty-eight
guns, commanded by-captain Dacres. Of her crew, fifty
were killed and sixty-four wounded. She had received
so much injury that it was thought to be impossible to get
her into port, and she wva.s burned. The iljury sustained
by the Constitution was sliglht; of her c.w, seven were
killed and seVe:n wounded; Althou:    f';e carried a few

more guls than her antagonist, yet the immense disparity
of effect clearly demonstrated the superior skill of the
American seamen. Captain Hull, on his return to the
U[Jnited States, was welcomed with enthusiasmrn, by his
grateful and admiring countrymen, who conferred upon
himn those honors and distinctions-most dear to tLe patriot
and lhero.
19. But this was the first only of a series of naval vic-!riies. On the 18th of October, captain Jones, in the
vVasp,: of eighteen guns, captured the Frolic, of twentytvwo, after a bloody conflict of three quarters of an hour.
i this action, the Americans obtained a victory over a
f,rce decidedly superior. On their part, but eight were
killed and wounded; on that of the enemy, about eighty!
On the 25th, the frigate United States, commanded by
*.aptain Decatur, encountered and captured the British
frigate MAlacedonian.  The former carried a few:guns the
most, but the disparity of loss was astonishingly great.
On the part of the enemy, a hundred and four were killed
an(l wounded; on that of the Americans, but eleven! Tthe
Wasp was unfortunately captured, soon after her victory,
by a Britishl ship of the line; the United States brought
her prize safely to New-York.
20. A fourth naval battle was fought, and a fourth
victory gained, on the 29th of December. On that day,
the Constitution, of forty-four guns, then comman(led by
captain Bainbridge, captured the British frigate Java, of
thirty-eight.  The combat continued more than three
hours. The Java was reduced to a wreck; of her crew
one hundred and sixty-one were killed and wounded; of
that of the Constitution, thirty-four.
21. These sucecessive victories were peculiarly gratifying
to the nation; they were gained, in the midst of disasters
on land, and by that class of citizens whose rights had
been violated: they were gained over a people claiming
to be lords of the sea, whomn long and continued success
had rendered haughty and insolent, and who had confidently
boasted that the whole American navywould soon be swept
from the ocean.
22. Many British merchantmen were likewise captured
by the American navy; and privateers, issuing from
almost every port, and many of them bearing flags inscribed
"Free Trade and Sailor's Right.s" were remarkably su.ccessfiul.''lThe number of prizes made during thefirst seven
Tm1o mths of the war, exceeded five Ihundred23. In the autumni of this year, the quadrennial pe'ad
for the election of presidenrt anrd vice-president again recurred. The candidates for president were, the incumbent,
James Madison of Virginia, and lDe Witt Clinton of NewYork; for vice-president, Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts, and Jared Ingersoll, of' Pennsylvania. Those who
were opl)posed to the war, supiported Mr. Clnton and Mr.
Ingersoll; and they were joined by many who h.-Aieved
that, should the former be elected president, and shotuld(
he find it irnpractible to mnake an honorable peace, hewould
call forth tle resources, and direct the arms of the iepublic,
with more decision and energy. Great exertions were
mnade by the partizans of the o)posing candidates, and the
passions of the people, especially in the middle and northerm states, were highly excited. Of the electoral votes
given, Mr. Madison received one hundred and twentyeight, and MiNr. Gerry one hbnd red and thirty-one, and were
elected. Mr. Clinton received eighty-nine, and Mdr. Ingersoll eighty-six.
CHAP'TER XXVII.
CAMPAIGN       OF   1813.
A'r tie commenT(Cmernt of the session of conrgress, held
in the aLttumn of 1812, the president, in his mnessage, stated
that, imrmediately after the declaration of war, he communicated to the British government the terms on which its
progress might be arrested; that these terms were, the
repeal of the orders in council, the diseharge of American
seamen, and the abandonment of the practice of impressment; and thtat the miniistry had declined to accede to
his offers.
2. He also stated that, at an early period of the war, he
had received official informaition of the repeal of the orders
in council; that two propositions for an armistice had been
made to him, both of which he had rejected, as they could
not have been accepted without conceding to Groat Britain
the right of imlnpressment.
3. The rejection of these propositions was approved by
the national representatives, who, far from abandoning the
groundi they had taken, adopted more vigorous mneasure.

authority, and finding the rebels in his power, pursued them
with unsparing rigor. Many were tried by courts martial,
and executed. The assembly interfered, praying him to
stop the work of death, and enacted laws which gradually
restored tranquillity. Soon after, Sir William returned to
England, and his authority devolved on colonel Jeffreys,
the lieutenant-governor. Under his administration, peace
was concluded with the Indians; and notwithstanding the
tyrannical regulations of the king, and the oppressive restrictions upon commerce, the colony increased in wealth
and population. In the year 1688, the number of inhabitants exceeded 60,000.
54. Between this period and the commencement of the
French war of 1756, an account of which will be found in
a subsequent chapter, but few events occurred in the
colony of sufficient importance to find a place in history.
Its position, remote from the settlements of the French in
Canada, and of the Spaniards in Florida, was favorable to
its quiet. New-England and New-York, on the one hand.
Georgia and the Carolinas on the other, protected it fron.
savage incursions. Its affairs were administered by gov.
ernors appointed by the king, and representatives chosen
by the people.
55. The laudable efforts of these representatives, to arrest the progress of slavery in the colony, ought not to be
passed over in silence. Convinced of its inhumanity, and
foreseeing the dreadful evils which it must produce, they
often passed laws prohibiting the importation of slaves
but those who were higher in authority, yielding to the
wishes of merchants engaged in the abominable traffic,
persisted, with criminal obstinacy, in withholding their
assent.  England, not America, is responsible for the
wretchedness, which her kings and her officers were
often' importuned, but refused, to avert.

Or the two companies incorporated by king James, an
account of the proceedings and dissolution of one, and a
history of the colony it founded, have been given in the
~preceding-chapter. To the other, or-Plymouth CompanyI
26wages of soldiers, were increased. The president was
authorized to raise twenty additional regiments of infantry,
to issue treasury notes, and to borrow money. Provision
was also made for building four ships of the line, six
frigates, and as many vessels of war onI the great lakes as,
the public service might require.
4. So great was the desire of the citizens of the western
eountry to regain possession of the territory of Michigan,
thiat, in-order to effect it, general Harrison resolved to
undertake a Winter campaign. General Winchester, with
a portion of the western army, proceeded in advance to
Frenchtown, a village on the river Raisin, not far from
Detroit. A British party stationed in the village was
attacked, routed, and entirely dispersed.
5. The Americans encamped near the field of battle, a
a part of them being protected by close garden pickets.
Although near an enemy's post, but little precaution was
taken to prevent a surprise. Early in the morning of tihe
22d of January, they were attacked by a large tbree of
British and Indians, the former commanded by colonel
Procter, the latter by the chiefs Roundhead and Splitlog.
The troops in the open field were thrown into disorder.
General Winchlester and other officers, made an ineffectual
attempt to rally them. They fled, butt while attempting to
escapewere mostly killed by the Indians. The general and
colonel Lewis were ma(le prisoners.
6. The troops behind the pickets maitntainred the contest
with undaunted bravery. At lenrgth colonel Proctor assured
general Winchester, that if the remainder of the Arnericans would immediately surrender, they should be protected
from massacre; but otherwise hlie would set fire to the
village, and would not be responsible for the conduct of
the savages. Intimidated by this threat, general Winchester sent an order to the troops to surrender, which
they obeyed.
7. Colonel Proctor,leavingthe wounied without a guard,
marched back immediately to Malden. The Indians accompanied therm- a few miles, but returned early the next
morning. Deeds of horror followed. The wounded officers were dragged from the houses! killed and scalped irv
the streets.'lte buildings were set on fire. Some wha
attempted to escape were forced back into tlhe flames.
Others were put to death by the tomahawk, and left
shockingly mangled in the highway. The infamy of this
butchery should not fall upon the perpetrators alone. It

must rest equally upon those who instigated them to hostility, by whose side they fought, who were able, and were
bouind by a solemn engagement to restrain them.
8. The battle and massacre at Frenchtown clothed
Kentucky and Ohio in mourning.   Other volunteers,
indignant at the treachery and cruelty of their foes, hastened to the aid of Harrison. He marched to the rapids
of Miami, where he erected a fort, which he called fort
Meigs, in honor of the governor of Ohio. On the first of
May, it was invested by a large aumber of Indians, and
by a party of British troops from Malden, the whole com
manded by colonel Proctor.
9. Five.days afterwards, general Clay, at the head of
1200 Kentuckians, made an attempt to raise the siege.
Dividing his force into several parties, and making an impetuous onset, he drove the besiegers from their works.
His troops, supposing the victory complete and disregarding
the orders of their commander, dispersed into the woods.
The enemy, retlrning from their flight, obtained an easy
victory. Of the Americans, two cr three hundred escaped
into the fort; about three hundred were killed or made
prisoners; the remainder fled to the nearest settlemenlts.
The enemy sustained considerable loss.
10. The fort continued to be defended with bravery and
skill.  The Indians, unaccustomed to sieges, became
weary and discontented. On the 8th of May, notwithstanding the entreaties of their chief, Tecumseh, they
deserted their allies. On the 9th, the enemy, despairing
of success, made a precipitate retreat. General Harrison,
leaving general Clay in commard, returned to Ohio for
reinforcements; but in this quarter active operations were
not resumed until a s(uadron had been built and prepared
for action on Lake Erie.
11. At Sackett's Harbor, on the northern frontier, a
body of troops had been assembled under the command of
general Dearborn, and great exertions were made, by
commodore Chauncey, to build and equip a squadron, on
Lakle Ontario, sufficiently powerful to contend with that
of the enemy. By the 25th of April, the naval preparations were so far completed that tlhe general, and 1706
troops, were conveyed across the lake to the attack of
York, the capital of Upper Canada.
12. Onl the 27th, an advanced party, led by brigadiergeneral Pike, who was born in a camp and bred a soldier

261edge, by a superior force. After a short but severe conflict, the enemy were driven to tl.eir tortifications. The
rest of the troops having landed, the whole party pressed
forward, carried the first battery by assault, and were
moving towards the main works, whlen-thie enemy's mp.gazine blew up, with a tremendous explosion, hurling upon the
ad lancing troops immense qoantities ot stone aind timber.
13. Numbers were killed, the gallant Pike seceived a
mortal wound; the troops halted for a momenet, but recovering fromn the sllock, again pressedl forward and soon
gained possession of the town. Of the British troops, one
hundred were killed, nearly three hundred were wounded,
and the same number made prisoners. Of the Americans,
three hundred and twenty were Killed and wounded, and
nearly all of them by the explosion of the magazine. The
flag which waved over the fort was carried to the dying
Pike; at his desire, it was placed under his head, wlihen,
with the smile of triumph on his lips,-he expired.
14. The object of the expedition attained, the squadron
and troops returned to Sackett's Harbor, whence, the
wounded and prisonrers being landed and other troops taken
on board, it sailed to Fort George, at the head of the lake.
After a warm er:gagement, the enemiy abandoned, and the
Americans entered the fort. The fugtitives retired to the
heights, at the head of Burlington hay. On their retreat,
they were joined by a detachment from Fort Erie and
Chippeway. Two brigades, under generals (Chandler and
Winder, were despatched in pursuit. Onr the evening of
the 5th of June, they encamped at Stoney Creelk, ip the
vicinity of the enemy, who, considering their situation
desperate, turned upon their pursuers and attacked themr
in the night.
15. The Americans re.eived them withi coolness; hbut
such was tle darknfss, that general Chanidler, intending
to place himself at the head of- his artillery, threw  himself into the midst of a British party. A few minutes
afterwards, tihe same mistake was committed by general
Winder. Satisfied with the capture of' these officers, and
a few other prisoners, the enemy made a precipitate retreat.'l'hie American troo)ps returned to Fort Georre.
This misfortune was soon fiollowed by another. Lieuten.

16. While the greater part of the American army was

MADISOINI'S

thus employed in Canada, the British made an attack upon
the important post of Saekett's Harbor. On the 27th of
May, their sqdadron appeared before the town. Alarmi
guns inrstantly assembled the citizens of the neighborhood.
General Brown, of the New-York militia, commanded in
chief, his whole force amounting to about one thousand
men. By his orders, a slight breastwork was hastily
thrown up, at the only place whiere the enenmy could land.
Behipd this, he placed the militia. the regulars under
colonel Backus formning a second linie.
17. On the morning of the 29th, one thousand British
troops landed from the squadron. They advanced toward
the breastwork. The militia, seized with a sudden panic,
fled in confusion. Colonel Mills, in a vain attempt to
rally them, was mortally wounded. The regulars, after a
spirited resistance, were compelled to retire toward the
town, but in their retreat they took possession of the houses
on the road. From these coverts they poured so destructive a fire upon the British column, that it halted and fell
back. General Brown, by a stratagem, converted this
slight check into a precipitate flight. Collecting the panic
struck militia, he directed their course along a road, which,
wMhile it led from the village, appeared to the British commander to lead to the place of lantding. Perceiving them
marching with great speed, he supposed that their object
was to cut off his retreat, and re-emnbarked so hastily as
to leave behind most of his wounded. General Brown,
in recompense for his services, was appointed a brigadier
in the regular army.
18. Meanwhile, upon the sea coast, a distressing and
predatory war was carried on, by large detachments from
the powerful navy of Great Britain. One squadron, stationed in Delaware bay, captured and bltrned every merchantvessel which camne within its reach. The inhabitants
of Lewiston, in the state of Delaware, having refused t
sell provisions to the enemy, the village was bombardel
and several attempts were made to land, but they were
defeated by the militia.19. Early in the spring, another and more powerfiul
squ.adron arrived in Chesapeake bay. It was commanded
by a(lnmiral (Ceckburn, who, departing fromn the usual modes
of honorable warfare, directed his efforts principally against
unoffending citizens and peaceful villages. The farm.
houses and gentlemeiL's seats near the shore were plundlered, and the cattle driven awav or wantonly slaughtered.

a similar fate, by the determined bravery of a small force
stationed on Craney Island, in the harbor. A ftrious
attack was made upon Hampton, whichI, notwithstanding
the gallant resistance of its small garrison, was captured,
and tthe unfiortunate inhabitants suffered all which a brutal
and unrestrained soldiery could inflict.
20. The ocean, in the mean time, had-been the tLeatre
of sanrguinary conflicts, in which the victors gained untarnished laurels. Captain Lawrence, in the sloop of war
Hornet, discovering, in the neutral port of San Salvador,
a British sloop of war of superior force, challenged her
commander to meet him at sea. Thle challenge being
declined, captain Lawrence blockaded the port until forced
by a ship of the line to retir e.
21. Soon after, on the 23d of February, the Hornet mnet
the British brig Peacock, of about equal force. A fierce
comrbat ensued. in less than fifteen miniutes, the Peacock
struck her colors, (lisplayiig, at the same time; a signal of
distress. TPhe victors hastened to the relief of the vanquished, anri( the sane strength whichl had been exerted to
coon(er wvas - n\ow  exerted to save. Their efforts were
but: pebrtial tly II. cessil. S'ie suiik before all her crew
could be remiovedl, c ra'yitg down nine British seamen and
three brave an(t generois Americans. In the battle, the
loss of the llornet waas but one killed and two wounded;
that of the Peacock was never ascertained.
22. On his return to the United States, captain Lawrence was pronioted to the command of the frigate Chesapeake, then in the harbor of Boston. For several weeks,
the British frigate Shannon, of equal force but having a
selected crew, had been cruisipg before the port; and captain Brook, her commander, had announced his wish to
meet, in single combat, an American frigate. Inflamed
by this challenge, captain Lawrence, although his crew
was just enlisted, and his offioers were strangers to him
and to each other, set sail, on the first of June, in pursuit
of the Shannon.
23. Towards evening of the same dayj they met, and
instantly engaged, witlh unexampled fury. In a very few
minutes, and in quick suceessien, the sailing master of the
Chesapeake was killed, captain Lawr. enee aniid three lieutenants were severely wounnded; her rigging was so cut to
pieces that sihe fell on board the Shannon, her chest ot'MADISON'S
[f181arms blew up, captain Lawrence received a second and
mortal wound and was carried below; at this instant, the
position of tihe ships being favorable, captain Brook, at the
head of his marines, gallantly boarded the Chesapeake,
when, every officer who could take command being liilled
or wounded, resistance ceased, and the American flag was
struck by the enemy.
24. That fortune favored the Shannon callnot be doubted.
That the event would have been the same had fortune
favored neither, is rendered probable by the astonishing
effect of her fire. This unexpected defeat impelled the
Americans to seek for circumstances consoling to their
pride, and in the journals of the day, many such were
stated to have ) preceded and attended the action. But
nothing could allay their grief at the fall of the youthful
and intrepid Lawrence. His previous victory and magnanimous coniduct had rendered him the favorite of the
nation, and he was lamented with sorrow, deep, sincere,
and lasting. When carried below, he was asked if the
colors should be struck. "No," he replied, "they shall
wave while I live." When the fate of the ship was decided, his proud spirit was broken. He became delirious
from excess of mental and bodily suffering. Whenever
able to speak, he would exclaim, " Don't give up the ship!"
an expression consecrated by his countrymen; and he
uttered but few other words during the four days that he
survived his defeat.
25. This victory was not achieved without loss. Of
the crew of the Shannon, twenty-four were killed and
fifty-six wounded. Of that of the Chesapeake, fortyeight were killed and nearly one hundred wounded. Great
was the exultation of the enemy. Victories over the
frigates of other nations were occurrences too colnmmnon to
excite emotion; but the capture of an American frigate
was considered a gloriouLs epoch in the naval history of
Great Britain. The honors and rewards bestowed upon
captain Brook were stuch as had never before been received
but by the conqueror of a squadron. These demonstrations
of triumph were inadvertent confessions of American superiority; and were, to the vanquishled themselves, sourees
of triumph and consolation.
26. The next encounter at sea was between the American brig Argus and the British brig Pelican. The lattei
was of superior force, anid was victorious. Soon after,
the American brig Enterprise, commanded by lieutenatt

captain Blyth. These vessels were of equtal force, but
the greater effect of the fire of the Enterprise furnislhed
to the Amnericans anothier prool of the superior skill of
their seamen. Both commnanders were killed in the action,
and were butried, each by the other's side, in Portland.
27. The events of the war again call our attention to
the northwestern frontier. While each nation was busily
employed in equipping a squadron on Lake Erie, general
Clay remained inactive at Fort Meigs. About the last of
July, a large number of British and Indians appeared before
the fort, hoping to entice the garrison to a general action
in the field. After waiting a few days without succeeding,
they decamped, and proceeded to Fort Stephenson, oni the
river Sandusky. This fort was little more than a picketing suirrounded by a ditch; and the garrison consisted of
but 160 men, who were commanded by major Croghan,
a youth of twenty-one. On the first of August, it was
invested by 500 regulars and 800 Indians.
28. After a cannonade, which continued two days, the
enemy, in the evening, supposing a breach had been made,
advanced to assault the workls. Anticipating this, major
Croghan had planted a six pounder, the only piece of cannon in the fort, in a position to enfilade the ditch. It was
loaded-with grape-shot and slugs, and was discharged the
instant the asailants arrived betfore it. The British commander and many of his men were killed, and many others
severely wounded. The remainder in haste and disorder
retreated to their former position, and at dawnt of day
retired to Malden. The youthful Croghanr, for his valor
and good conduct, was promoted to the rank of lieutenantcolonel. He and his brave companions received the thanks
of congress; and to evince their respect forhis virtues, the
ladies of Chillicothe presented to him an elegant sword.
29. In the mean time, by the exertions of comnmodore
Perry, an American squadron had been prepared for service
on Lake Erie. It consisted of nine smnall vessels, carrying in all fifty-four guns. A British squadron had also
been built and equipped, under toe superintendence of
comTnodore Barclay. It consisted of six vessels nrqounting
sixty-three guns.
30. Commrnodore Perry, immrnediately sailing, offered battle
to his adversary. On the tenth of Septemnber, the British
commander, having the wind in his favor, left the harbor
of Malden, to accept the offer. In a few hours, the wind.. MADISON'S 
266
L181267
shifted, giving the Americans the advantage.  Perry,
forming the line of battle, hoisted his flag, on which were
inscribed the words of the dying Lawrence, "Don't give
up the ship." Loud huzzas from all the vessels proclaimed
the animnation with which this motto inspired theirpatriotic crews.
31. About nGon, thle firing commenced; but the wind
being light, the Lawrence, the commodore's flag-ship, was
the only American vessel that could, at first, engage in
close action. For two hours, she contended alone with
two vessels, each nearly her equal in force. All but seven
of her crew were either killed or wounded, and she, by
the damage she had received, was rendered wholly unmnanageable. The wind springing up, captain Elliot was at
length enabled to bring the Niagara into action. To this
ship, commodore Perry, sailing in an open boat through
the midst of the fire, transferred his flag. Again the combat raged with undiminished fury. In a short time, one
of the British vessels surrendered, and soon after another;
and the rest of the American squadron now joining in the
actionii, the victory was rendered decisive and complete.
At four o'clock, the brave and fortunate commander despatched to general Harrison, at Fort Meigs, this laconic
epistle: "We have met the enemy, and they are ours."
32. Great was the joy which this brilliant victory occasioned throughout the union. That it was achieved
over a sutperior force; that it was the first ever gained
over a squadron; that it was entirely decisive; that it
opened the way to the recovery of all that had been lost
by the defeat of general Hull,-were circumstarnces whlich
threw every otiher victory into the shade,-anld cast the
brightest lustre upon the characters of tihe hemroes who had
gained it. At every place that he visitod, the gallant
Perry received the mrost flattering proofs of a nation's
gratitude and love.
33. As soonII as general IHarrison, u:ho had been joined
by governor Shelby with a large body of Kentucky militia,
received intellirence of this victo-.y, hlie hastened to the
lake, and was conveyed by the vWssels to Malden. The
British commander, anticipatinig this movement, had abandoned that place, which, on t~1e 28th of September, was
occupied, withlout opposition, by the American army.
34. rThe enemy, passing Detroit in their retreat, ascended
the river Thamnes, to the iTMoravian villages. They were
pursued by genera Hiar,.ison, and., on the 5th of October,

complete victory was easily and speedily gained. Six
hundred, nearly the whole of the party, were made prisoners; Tecumseh, the celebrated Illdian chief was killed;
and all the posts that had been surrendered by general Hull
were recovered from the enemy.
35. Leaving general Cass in command at Detroit, general
Harrison, with part of the regular force, again embarked,
on board the vessels, and, on the 24th, arrived at Buffalo,
in New-York, intending to join the American a:rmy onrl the
Niagara frontier. But a sufficient number of general officers having been assigned to that army, he received permission to return to his family.
36. Previa;is to the events just related, general Dearborn, in conseqiuence of severe indisposition, was withdrawn fromn active service, and general Wilkinson appointed
to command the army of the centre, which comprised
about 7000 men. Having received orders, from the secretary of war, to descend the St. Lawrence and attackl Montreal, lie directed the scattered detachments to assemble at
Grenadier-Island, on lake Ontario. Such were the difficul ties attending the concentration of the troops, arnd such
perhaps the want of vigor in the commander, that the
flotilla, upon which they embarked, did ilinot get under way
intil the 5th of November.
37.'I'heir progress was impeded by parties which the
enemy, at every convenient position, had stationed on the
Canada shlore. To disperse these, a body of troops, unler the command of general Brown, was landed, and
directed to mrnarch in advance of the boats. At Chrystler's
fields, on thte 11th of November, a body of the enemy, of
equal force, was encountered. In the battle which ensued,
both fought with resolute bravery, and both claimned the
victory. The loss of the Americans was greatest, but
they drove the eniemy from their position, and enabled the
lotilla to pass unmolested.
38. The next day it arrived at St. Regis. At this place,
general Hampton, who commanded the troops at Plattsburg, had been ordered to meet the main army, and no
doubt had been entertained of his disposition and ability
to comrnply with the order. But here general Wilkinson,
to his surprise and mortification, was informed that the
contemplated junction would lot taklte place. The project
of attacking Montreal was abandoned, and the army uinder Wilkij.son, marching to Freich Milils, there encamped
for the winter.
- MADISON'S
p1813.39. This abortive issue of the campaign occasioned
murmnurs throughlout the nation. The causes which led
to it have never been fully developed. The sevelest censure fell upon general Armstrong, who was secretary of
war, and upon general Hampton. The latter soon after
resigned his comnmission in the army, and general Izard
was selected to command the post at Plattsburg.
40. In the progress of our narrative, some events have
been passed over, which will now be related. In the
early part of this year, the emperor of Russia offered his
mediation to the two powers at war. On the part of the
I Tnited States the offer was pronmptly accepted, and Messrs.
Adams, Gallatin, and Bayard, were appointed commlis
sioners to negotiate, at St. Petersburg, a peace under the
proffered mediation.
41. On the 24th of May, congress was convened by
proclamation of the president. Laws were enacted imposing a direct tax of three millions of dollars; authorizing
the collection of various internal duties providing for a
loan of seven and a half million of dollars; and prohibiting
the merchant vessels of the United States from sailing
under British licenses. Near the close of the session, a
committee, appointed to inquire into the subject, made a
long report upon the spirit and manner in whichl the war
had been conducted by the enemy. Many proofs were preseonted of shameful departures from the rules of warfare
observed by civilized nations.
42. In September, commodore Ch'auncey made two crui-.
ses upon lake Ontario, and repeatedly offered battle to the
enenmy's squadron, which was superior in force hut Sir
Janmes Yeo, the British commander, intimidated by the
result of thle battle on lake Erie, retired before him. 0Ot
one occasion, however, in, a ruinning fight, his shlips sustained considerable injury.
43. In the same month, captain Rogers, who cornmanded
the frigate President, returned from a long cruise, having
captured eleven merchantmen; but he met no armed yesvels, the capture of which could enhance his reputation,
Captain Porter, in the Essex rode triumphant in the Pacific ocean, annoying the trade of the enemy and protecting
that of the republic.
44. The Indians at the southern extremity of the vnion
had imbibed the same hostile spirit as those at the Northwestern. They had been visited by Tecamseh, and, by
his eloquence, persuaded, that the great Spirit required

was assigned a portion of the American continent lying
farther to the north, and at that time called North Virginia.
2. The latter, in 1606, the year in which both were incorporated, despatched a ship to make discoveries within
the limits of its grant. Before the voyage was completed,
she was captured by the Spaniards. Another ship, afterwards sent for the same purpose, returned with such a favorable account of the territory that the company was encouraged to proceed in the undertaking.
3. The next year, forty-five men were sent over and left
at the mouth of the river Kennebec. In 1608, dispirited
by the hardships they had endured, they returned to England in ships which had brought them provisions and succors. The company, disappointed and dissatisfied, desisted
for a while'from a1l attempts to effbect a settlement.
4. In 1614, John Smith, the same who acted a conspicuous part in the settlement of Virginia, made a voyage
to this northern country, touching first at the mouth of the
Kennebec. Sailing thence, in an open boat, he surveyed
the coast to the southern boundary of Massachusetts bay.
The northern promontory he named Tragabigzanda, in honor of the Turkish lady to whom he had fbrmerly been a
slave. The three small islands, lying near the head of
the promontory, he called the Three Turks' Heads, in
memory of his victory over the three Turkish champions.
Both appellations have been changed for others. On his
return to England, he presented to prince Charles a map
of the country, and gave him such a glowing description
of its beauty and excellence, that he, in the warmth of his
admiration, declared it shliould bear the name of NEwENGLAND.
5. Smith afterwards made an attempt to transport a colony thither, which was unsuccessful; and New-England
might long have remainied the abode of wild beasts and
savages only, had not motives, more powerful than the
love of gain or of perilous adventures, impelled men, differing from all others who had been the founders of colonies, to select it as the place of their residence.
6. In the beginning of the seventeenth century, James
I asserted and maintained a despotic power over the
consciences of his English subjects. All who pr-esumed
to dissent from the creed which he had adoptedt were
persecuted with extreme rigor. In that age, the maxim
was avowed by ecclesiastics of all sects as well as politicians,that uniformity in religion was essential to the

and had proniised them victory as the reward of their exertions.  rn thle fall of 1812, a crutel war was carried on,
by the Creeks and Semnin(les, against the frontier inhabitants of Georgia. General J.lack-son at the hea( of 2500

the Indians. They, overawed bv hlis presece, (desisted

Coffee, encountering, at Taltlishatchie, a body of Indians,
a sanguinary coinflict ensued.'l'he latter fonght with
desperation, neither  ivia nor receiving (tquarter, until
nearly every warrior ha;d perished.
47. At Taliadega, another battle was fouglit, in Whieh
thlree hundred Indians perished. The rest of the party,
exceeding seven hundred, fled. Genieral Jackson's provisions being exhausted, he was utnable to pursue them.
While on his return to the settlenments, to obtain a supply,
his troops became refractory and even mutinous. Nearly
all returned to their homes; but to the small number that
remained were sooni added a reinforcement of one thousand
mounted volunteers.
48. At the head of this force, he marched to Ernuckfaw,
within a bend of the Tallapoosa, where a body of the
enemry were posted. To several skirmishes succeeded a
general battle, in which the whites were victorious, but
sustained considerable loss. For the relief of the wounded,
Jackson returned to Fort Strother, where the volunteers
were discharged. General White from East Tennessee,
and general Floyd from Georgia, led separate expeditions,against the Indians,,. and were victorious in every combat.. C%OYA1813.1AD              NITA       ON27
So enraged were the savages, that but few would accept
of quarter or seek safety in retreat.
49. Yet still was the spirit of the Creeks unsubdued,
and their faith in victory unsihaklen. With no little sagacity and skill, thc) select.'d and fortified alnother position
on the Tallapoosa, called by themselves'J'ohopeka, and(
by the whites, Horse-shoe Bend. Here nearly a thousand
warriors, animated with a fierce and determined resolution,
were collected.  Three thousand men, commanded by  
general Jackson, marched to attack this post. To prevenl
escape, a detachment, under general Coffee, encirc!ed the(
Bend.'I'The main body, keeping within it, advanced to the
fortress. For a few minutes, the opposing forces were
engaged, muzzle to muzzle, at the port holes. Soon the
troops, leaping over the walls, mingled with the savages.
Trhe combat was furious and salnguinary. The Ind(lians,
fleeing at length to the river, beheld the troops on the
opposite bank. Returning, they fought with increased
flry and desperation, and continued to resist until night.
six hundred warriors were killed; four only yielded themselves prisoners; the remaining three huindred escaped.
Of the whites, fifty-five were killed, and onre hundred and
forty-six woilunded.
50. It was expected that another stand would be made,
by the Indians, at a place called the Hickory-ground.
General JacksOn mnarched thither in April. The principal
chiefs came out tot meet him, and amnong them was Wether-ord, a half blood, distinguished e4ually for his talents and

CONCLUSION OF THE WAR.
IN the winter of 1813-14, the fifteenth congriess,eId a
second session. To increase the number, and to aid to
the efficiency of the army, several laws were passed, by
one of which the enormous bounty of one hundred and
twenty-four dollars was offered to recruits. The president
was authorized to borrow twenty-five mrrillions of dollars,
and to issue treasury notes to the amotunt of five millions,
2. Before the termination of the session, a commlunication
was received from the British government; declining to
treat under the mediation of Russia, and proposing a direct
negotiation at London or Gottenburgh, The proposition
was accepted by the American government, who chose
Gottenrburgh as the place of meeting, for which Ghent was
afterwards substituted; and Henry Clay and Jonathan
Russell, were joined with the commrnissioners already in
Europe. Mr. Clay, in consequence, relinquished the station of speaker of the hmise of representatives~, and was
succeeded by Lahgdo, Chevesf of South-Carolina.
3. Early in the spring, the American army marched fromn
French-Mills; a part of the troops, under the conirnand of
general Wilkinson, proceeding to Plalnttsbrgh, and the
remailnder, under general Brown, returning te Sackett's
Harbor.  Near the last of Marech, general Wilkinson
penetrated into Canada, and attacked.a body of the enemy,
occupying a large stone mniill en the river La Cole. He
was repulsed with considerable loss.  This defeat detracted from his already diminished reputation. He was
removed from command, and general Izard appointed to
succeed him.
4. Fo' three months, the armies of both nations continued inactive. Meanwhile information was received of
the stupendous events which had recently occurred in
Europe. The emperor of F'rancee having been arrested
in his victorious career and sustained defeat after defeat,
was compelled to abdicate Lis throne, and retire to the
island of Elba. Louis the XVIII was proclaimed king
and Great Britain, at peace with all the world but the
United States, was en-abled to direct against them alonelP14.]         AD     NSTA       ON27
the immense force which had been employed to crush
her rival.  She delayed not to use the advanttges afforded by her good fortune.- From the ports of conquered
France, ships of war and transports bearing veteran and
victorious troops, sailed to the American continent, some
destined to the Niagara: frontier, and some to: the Atlantic
coast.       -  
5. These events could not be viewed with indifference
by the American people.'The friends of the administration
anticipated a severer coniflict, and prepared for greater
sacrifices and greater sufferings. Its opposers were encouraged to make more vigorous efforts to wrest the reins
of authority-from men w,,o, they asserted, had shown
themselves incompetent to hold them. These efforts,
althollgh condemned by a great majority of the people, diniinished in no slight degree, the strength of the-republic.
6. In the beginning of July, general Brown, who had
beenr assiduously employed in disciplining his troops,
crossed the Niagara with about 3000 men, and took possession, witlhoult opposition, of F'ort I-Erie. In a strong
position, at Chippewa, a few miles distant, was intrenched
an e(lual nurmber of British troops commanded by general
Riall. On the 4th, general Brown approached their works.
The next day, the two armies met in the open-field. The
conflict was obstinate and bloody.  I'he Americans were
victorious; and the enemy, having sustained the loss of
five hundred mnen, sougkat safety behind their intrenichments.
7. This decisive victory, achieved after so many reverses,
was hailed as an omen of future success. Soon afterwvards,
general Riall, abandoning his works, retired to the heights
of Burlington. Hlere lieutenant-general Drummond, with
a large reinforcement, joined him, and assuming the command, led back the army towards the American caimp

whose roar was sileinced by the thunder of cannon and the
din of arms, but was (listinctly heard dturingy the pauses of
the fight.- At intervals the moon shone brightly, but oftern
her-light was obscured. Against a superior forpe, the
Americans, for several hours, corntended with various success. During the first part of the engagement, they were
sorely annoyed, into whatever part of the field they rimight

f73that battery-V said general Ripley to colonel Miller.: I'll
try, sir," was the laconic answer. At the word of corn-,mand his men, with steady courage, ascended the hill,
idvaaced to the muzzles of the cannon, killed with the
bayonet seyeral artllUery,men, on the point of firing their
pieces, and drove the remainder before them.
9. Both parties were instantly reinforced, and the enemy
made a daring effort to regain their cannon. They were
repulsed, but quiekly repeated the attempt. Nearly all
the opposing forces gathered aromnd this position, and to
possess it ws the sole object of both armies. Again the
enemy were repulsed; but again they renewed the effort
After a violent conflict, they were a third time driven
fr.Om the hill. The firing then ceased; the British troops
were withdrawn; and the Americans were left in quiet
possession of the field.
10. Generals Brown and Scott having both been severely
wounded, the command devolved upon genleral Rllipley.
e remyained a few hours upon the hill, collected the,Wu~ded, and then returned unmolested to thie camp.
The number of the killed and wounded proves the bravery
of the combatants, and the severity of the conflict, On
the American side it was 743; on the British, one hundred
less; and of the latter 117 more were missing than of the
former. The British, therefore, besides losing their position, sustained the greater loss of men.
11. General Ripley fuqind his force so much weakened,
that he deemed it prudent again to occupy Fort Erie. On
the 4th of August, it was invested by general Drummond
with 5000 troops. In defending it, no less bravery and
skill were requisite, and no less were displayed, than in
contending in the field. In the night between the 14th
and 15th, the besiegers made an assault utpon the fort,
which was repelled with conspicuous gallantry by the
garrison, the former losing more than nine hundred men,
the latter but eighty-four.
12. The siege was still continued. On the id of September, general Brown, having recovered from his wounds,
threw himself into the fort and- took command of the garrison. For their fate, great anxiety was felt by the nation,
which was, however, in some degree, removed by the
march from Plattsbllrgh of five thousand men to their
relief. On the 17th, a sortie was made by the besieged,
general Porter (of the New-York militia, and general Miller
of the segular army, commandik g divisions. The bravery

of the troops equalled that which they had displayed in the
recent contests. After an hour of close fighting, they
returned to the fort, having killed, wounded, and taken
one thousand of the enemy. Their loss was severe,
amounting to more than five hundred.
13. On the 21st of September, the forty-ninth day of
the siege, general Drummond withdrew his forces, relieving
the garrison from their toil, which had been incessant, and
from their danger, which hiad been encountered without
fear. Seldom have troops deserved higher praise of their
country. On the 9th of October, general Izard arrived
with the reinforcement from Plattsburgh, and being senior
officer, took the command. On the 18th, he marched,
with his whole force, in pursuit of the enemy, whom he
found at Chippewa, strongly posted in a fortified camp.
After making several unsuccessful attempts to entice them
into the field, he evacuated Canada, and placed his troops
in winter quarters at Buffalo, Blackrock, and Batavia.
14. The marcli of the troops from Plattsburgh having
left that post almost defenceless, the enemy determined to
attack it by land, and, at the same time, to attempt the
destruction of the American flotilla on Lake Champlain.
On the 3d otf Septemnber, Sir George Prevost, the governorgeneral of Canada, with an army of 14,000 men, most of
whom had served in the wars of Europe, entered the territories of the United States. As soon as his object was
ascertained, brigadier-general Macomb, the commander at
Plattsburgh, called to his aid the militia of New-York and
Vermont, who, with alacrity and without distinction of
party,-obeyed the call.
15. -On the 6th, the enemy arrived at Plattsburgh, which
is situated near Lake Chlamplain, on the northerly bank of
the small river Saranac. On their approach, the American
troops, who were posted on the opposite bank, tore up the
planks of the bridges, with which they formed slight
reastworks, and prepared to dispute the passage of the
stream. Several attempts to cross it were made by the

until the 11 th, the British army were employed in erecting
batteries, while the American forces were every hour augmented by the arrival of volunteers and militia.

harbor of Plattshbnrgh, where that of the United States9

17. At. nine o'clock- the battle commenrced.. Seldom
has the ocean witnessed a more fhrious; encounter than
now took place on the bosom of.this transparent and
peaceful.lake. At the same mornent, the enemy on land
began -a heavy cannonade upon the American lines, and
attempted, at different places, to cross the Saranac. At
a ford above the village the strife was hot and deadly. As:often. as the enemy advanced into the water, they received
a destructive fire from the milit'a, and their dead bodies
floated down the streamr literally crimsoned with blood..
18. At half past eleven, the shout of victory, heard
along the_ American lines, announced thie result of the
battle on the lake. A second Britishl squadron had yielded
to the prowess of American seamen. The cry animated
to braverdeeds their brethren on the landl. Fainterbecame
the-efforts of the enemy. In tlhe afternoon, they withdrew
to their intrenchments. In the night, they begyan a precipitate retreat, and had fled eighit amiles before their departure was known in tthe Americ.an camp.
19. Upon the lake, the Amnelican loss was 110; the
British 194, besides prisoners, On land, the American
loss was 119; that of the British was estimated at 2500.
In the latter number, however, were included more than
five hundred British s.odiers, who, preferring A.inerica to
their native country, desert-ted fron' the-i retreatinig army.

ticipating a great augmentation of the enemy's force, and
uncertain where the blow would fall, made exertions to
place every exposed position in a- posture of.defence.
The citizens of New-York displayed extraordinary activity
and -zeal, Philadelphia and Baltimore were supposed to
be in less danger, but additicuis were made-to their fortifi-.cations.  For the protection of Washington, a military
district, embracing Maryland, Ctoluinmbia, and. a part of
Virginia. was established, and the command of it given to
general Winder, of Baltimore.. One thousand regular
troops were placed at his disposal, and he.was authorized
to call to his aid 15,000 nmilitia....
2'2. In th.1e lbeginning of August, the expected reinforcements, consisting of many vessels of war, and aI large
number of troops, arrived in the Chesapeake from Europe.
Of this force several firigates and bomib vessels were ordered
to ascend the Potomac; another division, under Sir Peter
Parlier, was directed to threaten Baltimore; the niain body
ascended the Patuxent as far as Benedict, where, on the
19th of. August, five thousand men, commanded by general
Ross, were landed.  
23. In the mean time, general Winder had called on the
militia to repair to his standard. They were exceedingly
remiss in obeying the call. On the 22d, not more than
two tlousand had assembled. At the head of ithiese, and
of one thousand regulars, he took a position not far fromn
the enemy, intending to prevent their progress into tihe
country.
24. A particular account of the subsequent events will
not be attempted. General Ross, marching through a
scattered population, advanced towards Washington. The
Amnericans retired before him. A stand was made near
Bladensburgh. The militia fled on the approach ofdanger;
but a body of seamnen and marines, commanded.-by commodore Barney, not only maintained their ground, bu
compelled the enemy to give way..: Theyrallied(l, however,
immediately; outflanked the.heroic band, put it to flight,
and hastened forward.                     -
25. The retreating forces were ordered to. assemble on
the heights near the capitol; and their they were joined
by a body of Virginia militia.  But general Winder,-considering his force too weak to oppose effectual resistance,
retreated to the heights of (Georgetown. Washington, thus
left defenceless, was deserted by miost of the citizens
26. On the 24th, at Aight. o'clock in the evening, the

enemy entered the city, and at nine, the capitol, president's
house, and many other buildings, were set on fire. Valuable libraries, works of taste, and elegant specimens of
the fine arts, were consigned to destruction.  On the
evening of the next day, the enemy left the city, and returned unmolested to Benedict; where, on the 30th, they
embarked on board the transports. Their loss, during the
incursion, including deserters, and such as died from fatigue
on the march, exceeded eight hundred.
27. The capture of Washington reflected disgrace upon
those by whom it ought to have been defended. Tlle (lestruction of the national edifices attached a still darker
stigmato the character of the enemy. The whole civilized
world exclaimed against the act as a violation of the rules
of modern warfare. The capitals of most of the European
kingdoms had lately been in the power of an enemy; but
in no instance had the conqueror been guilty of similar
conduct. An indignanilt spirit pervaded the republic. The
friends of the government were not only increased in
number, but felt an additional motive to exert all their
faculties to overcome the enemy of their country.
28. The squadron which, at the same time, ascended
the Potomac, met with even less resistance than that
which ascended the Patuxent. As soon as it arrived at
Alexandria, the citizens proposed a capitulation; and the
terms were speedily adjusted with the British commander
To purchase safety, they delivered up all their shipping
all the merchandize in the city, and all the naval and ord.
nance stores public and private. With a fleet of prizes,
loaded with a rich booty, the enemy returned immediately
to the ocean.
29. The success of the attack on Washington encouraged
general Ross to undertake an expedition against Baltimore
On the 12th of September, he landed 5000 men on Norti
Point, about fourteen miles from the city, to which h
directed his march. Preparations for defence had alread3
been made. The whole of the militia had been caller
into the field; the aged and the rich had volumtarily
entered the ranks; and assistance had been obtained from
Pennsylvania and Virginia.
30. General Smith, who commanded the American
forces, detached general Striker, with three thousand men,
to retard the progress of the enemy. The advanced parties
met about eight miles from the city.  In the skirmtish
which ensued general Ross was killed. The invaders,279
however, utnder the command of colonel Brooke, continued
to advancej and soon met and attakedki the detachment
under Striker. One of the militia regiments gave way.
This communicated a panic to the others, and the general
fell back to the heights, where, behind breastwotks hastily
etecteds the main body of the Americans awaited an attack
3   After landing the troops at North Point; the British
fleet had sailed up tlie PetapscO and bombarded Fort
McHenty and Fort Covington, which stand at the entrance
into the harbor. T'he former was commanded by major
Armistead, the latter by lieutenaint Newcomb: of the navy.
Both were gallantly defended, the fleet was repulsed, and
the commander of the troops, finding that the naval force
could afford no farther assistance, retreated, on the 14th,
to North Point, ind the next day re-embarked, Soon
after, the fleet left Chesapeake bay, and pairt proceeded
southward to con-rVey the troops to the theatre of future
operatioas and of anprecedented slaughteri.,
32. In the New.-England states, a rajority of the people
were, from the first, opposed to the war and as it restrained
them fromi their most profitable pursuits $ comnmerce and
the fishieries, their dissatisfaction contiiued to increase;
They complained that their peculiar interests were disregardeds and that the government, employhig elsewhere the
resources drawn from New-England, did not afford thenr
that protection to which, as a part of the tnation, they were
etitled. The most zealous therefore ueco&amp;nmended that;
not only the militia but thie revenue should be retained ai
home and employed for their own defetnce and protection.
33. The general court of Massachusetts proposed that
a convention of deleg.ates, fromn the New-England states,
should asse'ible at Hartford to deviCe means to obtain
redress of their grievances. To this proposition Contnecticut and Rhode Island acceded. In December the
convention met, consisting of delegates from those states,
appointed by their legislatures; of t*o from New Hlampshire, and onie friom Vermont, appointed at c-vunty meetings.
Their sittings were secret. Upon their adiourument, they
published an address to the people, in wmhich; in bold and
forcible langtage, they enumerated thie measures of the
national government- sipposedl to be particularly detrimental toy the interests of New-England, and of the commercial class of the nation, and proposed( such amendments

repose of society, anid that it was therefore the right and
duty of every sovereign to preserve it in his dominions, by
the exercise of all his powers of restraint and punishment.
7. But free inquiry had lately received such an impulse
from the success of Luther ann the other reformers, that
the civil authority was unable to arrest or control it. Various sects arose, dissenting from the established religion,
and all distinguished by their democratic tenets respecting
church government. Persecuted at home, a small iimher, belongingto th te sect which were afterwards called
Inidependents, removed to Leyden, in Holland, where they
torined a distinct society under the care of their pastor,
the Rev. John Robinrsoni. By their rigid virtues and exernplary deportmnent, they.acquired the respect ofthe magistrates and citizens.
8. After residing several years in that city, various considerations induced them to resolve to leave it. In 1618,
they applied to the London, or South Virginia, Company
for a grant of lanrd in America; and to ensure success,
they observed, "that they were well weaned fromn the delicate milk of the mother country, and inured to thie diffi.
culties of a strange land; that they were knit together by
a strict and sacred bond, by virtue of which they held
themselves bound to take care of the good of each othei
and of the whole; that it was not with them as with other
men, whom small- things could discourage, or small dis.
contents cause to wish themnselves home again."
9. A grant was obtained, and in September, 1620, a part
of them set sail for Hudson's river; but the master of the
ship, bribed, it is said, by the Dutch,-who claimed the
sole right of trading in that quarter, carried them farther
north, and the first land they discovered was Cape Cod.
This, they were aware, was beyond the limits of the London Company, but it was now November, and too late in
the season to put again to sea. They therefore determined
to land at the first place they could find suitable for a set.
tlement.
10. Before leaving the ship, the hegls of families and
freemen, forty-one in number, signed a solemn covenant,
combining themselves into a body politic for the purpose
of making equal laws for the general good. They ordained
that a governor and assistants should be annually chosen,
but the sovereign power remained in the whole body of
freemen. John Carver was elected governor.
11 On the 11th of December, [O. S.] they landed on a
2834. In the-fall, informationi was received that the American and British- commissioners had met and -held conferences at Ghent.- Great Britain, rendered arrogant by
her recenit triumphs in Europe, by the capture of Washington, aind by thie boi)ldness of the opposition, de&amp;manded
terms which extinguished thie hope of a speedy reconciliatioin.  Congress -shrunk not from the duty which the
crisis imposed. Although the expenditures of the nation
greatly exceeded the income; although its finances were
d. lisorder, and its credit was impaired, yet the national
legislature, with undaunted firmness, entered upon the taski
of fitrniishing the means to prosecute.the war witlh increased
vigor. The taxes were au,gmented, and new loans were
authorized. The duties of se.vretarv at war, from which
post general Armstrong was remnoved, were assigned to Ntr.
Monroe,:the secretary of state, and Mr. Dallas of Pennsylvania, was appointed secretary of the treasury.
35. TIle repose of general. Jackson, and of thi troops
whom lie commanded, was interrupted by the arrival at
Pensacola, in August, of' three British ships of war, bring--
ing three hundred soldiers,-and(I arms and armmunition ito
be distributed among the Inidians of Florida. The troops
were permnitted, by the Spaniards, to take possession of
the' fort, and the coremrander issued a proclamation, indieating an intention of carryinig on war against the adjacent
parts of tha republic.  -  
36. (General Jackson, with characteristic promptness,
took instant and efficient measures for calling to his aid
the patriotic mlilitia, who had before been victorious under
his banners. And having remonstrated in vain with tihe
governor of Pensacola, for affording shelter and protection
to) the enemies of the United States, he, near the end of
October, at the head of a body of regulars and two thousand,nom,ited volunteers, marched against that place. A:flag
er.t to dlemand redress, was fired on from the batteries.
immediately marched, into the city, stormed the fort,.'-t ained entire lpossession, and complelled the British to
evacuate Florida.
37. Returning to his head-quarters at Mobile, he there
received intelligence that a powerful expeditiorn Was on
thle way to attack New-O()rleans.  Without delay, he
m,arched with his troops, to that city. He found it in a
state of confusion and alarm.  The militia, composed of
men:of all nations, was -imperfectly organized. Many,
feeling no attachment to the republic, had refused to-enter

the ranks. No fortifications existed on the various routes
by which the place could be approached;and fears were
entertained that the reinfbrcements of militia, which were
expected from Kentucky and Tennessee, could not arrive
in time to take part in the contest.
38. Undismayed by the difficulties which surrounded
him, general Jackson adopted the most decidedand efficient
means for the safety of this rich and important city. He
visited in person every exposed point, and. designated the
positions to be fortified. He mingled with the citizens
and. infused into the greater part his own spirit and energy.
By his presence and exhortations, they were animated to
exertions of which before they were not supposed to be
capable. All who could wield a spade, or carry a mnusket,
were put to work upon the fortifications, or trained in the
art of defending them.
39. The Mississippi, upon the east bank of which NewOrleans stands, flows to the ocean in several chlannels.
One, leaving the main stream above the city, runs east of
it and forms, in its course, Lake Ponchartrain and Lake
Borgne. Early in December, the enemy entered this
channel. Their whole force amounted to about 8000 men,
a part of whom had just left the shores of the Chesapeake,
and the remainder had arrived directly from England. A
sniall squadron of gunboats uiider lieutenant. Jones, was
despatched to oppose their passage into the lake. These
were met by a superior force, and after a spirited conflict,
in which the killed and wounded of the enemy exceeded
the whole number of the Americans, they were compelled
to surrender.
40. This disaster required the adoption, in the city, of
more vigorous measures. Disaffection growing bolder,
martial law was proclaimed; the authority of the civil
magistrate was suspended; and arbitrary power was assumed and exercised by the comniander-in-chief. May
no emnergency hereafter occur, in which a military officer
shall consider himiself authorized to cite, as a precedent,
this violation of the constitution.
41. On the 21st of December, four thousand niilitia
arrived from Teniiessee. On the 22d, the enemy, having
previously landed, took a position near the main channel
of the river, about eight miles below the city. In the
evenin-g of the 239d, general Jackson made. a sudden and
fuirious attack upon their camip.'lThey were thrown into
didorder; but they soon rallied and fought with bravery

equal to that of the assailants. Satisfied with the advantage first gained, he withdrew his troops, fortified a strong
position four miles below New-Orleans, and supported it
by batteries erected on the west bank (of the river.
42. On the 28th of December, and first of January~
vigorous but u:successful attacks were made upon these
fortifications by the enemy.  In the mean time, both
armies had received reinforcements; and general Packenham, the British comnmander, resolved to exeit all his
strength in a combined attack upoil the Amerioarv positijrons
on both sides of the river. With almost incredible indus-.
try, he caused a canal, leading from a creek emptying into
Lake Borgne to the main channel of the Mississippi, to
be dug, that hlie might remove a part of his boats and artillery to tile latter. All thiiigs being prepared, the 8th
of Janlluary was assigned for the assault.
43. In the night, a regiment was transported across tte
river, to storm the works on the western bank, and tiurn
the guns on the American troop.s on the eastern, Early
in the morning, the main body of the enemy, consisting of
seven or eight thousand men, marched from their camnp to
the assault. WVVhile approaching, fearless and undaunted,
shoiwers of grape-shot thinned their:anks. When they
camne wvithin musket-shot a vivid stream of fire burst from
thle American lines. General Jackson having placed his
troops in two ranks, those in the rear loaded for those in
frontt, enabling them  to fire with scarcely a moment's
intermission.  The militia of the west, trained from
infancy to the use of the rifle, seldom took unrsteady or
uncertain aimn. The plain was soon covered *7ith dead
andi wounded. Somne British regiments faltered and fell
back; but others adlvanced and presented new victims.
While bravely leading to the walls the regimrent which
bore the ladders, gerneial Packenham was killed.  In
attempting to restore order and to rally the fugitives
general Gibbs, the second in command, was wounded
m-ortally, and fgeneral Keene severely. Without officers
to (direct thesn, the troops first halted, tlhen fell back, and
soon fled in disorder to their camp. In little more tlian
anl hour, two thousantd of the enemy were laid prostrate
upon the fieid; while of the Americans but seven were
killed anld six wounded-a disproportion of loss without a
parallel in time aninals of wvarfire.

warlike operations. There the Americans were thrice the
number of the assailants, and were protected by intrenchments; but they ingloriously fled. They were closely
pursued, until the British party, receiving intelligence of
the defeat of the main army, withdrew from pursuit and
recrossed the river. They then returned and reumined
possession of their intrenchments.
45. General Lambert, upon whom the command of the
3ritish army had devolved, having lost all hope of success,
prepared to return to his shipping. In his retreat he was
not molested: general Jackson wisely resolving to hazard
nothing that he had gained, in attempting to gain still more.
46. In the midst of the rejoicings for this signal victory,
a special messenger arrived from Europe, with a treaty of
peace, which, in December, had been concluded at Ghent.
The British govermnent had receded from all their demands; and as the orders in council had been repealed,
and all motive for the impressment of seaman hlad ceased
withl thle war in Europe, no stipulation, in relation to these
subjects, was inserted in the treaty, which provided mnerely
for the restoration of peace and the revision of boundaries.'The treaty was immediately ratified by th, president and
senate.
47. The war, however, did not cease on the ocean, until
two additional victories had imparted a brighter lustre to
the republican flag. In February, the Constitution, then
cruising under the command of captain Stewart, captured
the Cyane and Levant, whose forces united were superior
to hers; and in March, the sloop Hornet captured the
brig Penguin, stronger in guns and men than the victor.THE English colonies of North America were settled under
the most favoraisle auspices. Tle mind of man had'ust burst
firon(i thiraldoim, and begun to delight in the ftee anu vigorous

ad yet not so high. as to be a-bove the power of the oppressor.''he perseclutions they had endured rendered the principles of
civil ad(l. religious liberty more dear to their hearts; and led
to inquiries and reflections, which fixed a conviction of their
truth mnore firmly in their understandings.

reject those provisions, wlich sacrificed the lappiness of miany
to tIe splendor of a few; and to adopt such only as gave equal
rights ansd privi!eges to all.
4. In every nation of Europe, ecclesiasti-ai estal)lishments
existed, almnost co-ordinate with the civil a.; thority  The offiscers of these establishments were nu-merous, ind their privileges',.....r pivi eges
extensive.  For their support, in early times, a tenth part of
the inoom-e of the laiy was appropriated.  Possessing wealth,
and rank, and learning, their influence was great, and was
co.rstantly exerted to acquire aind preserve donminion over the
iindids and consciences of mern. T heir scecess was equal to

their wealth and powver, until, corrnLpted by luxury and idleress, they forgot their duties to God and to man; and encumlbere(i sociely with a useless and oppressive weight.
5. No part of these establishlments have been transferred
to America.  The first settlers of mnost of the colonies were
too proud of their attainmerits, in spiritual knowledge, to SLunlit to dictation in matters of faith; and, too indepen,dent in
feeling to acknowledge a superior on earth.  -lere man re.
sunmed his natLur-al and dignified station; and the ministers oI

andl manners, have seldom sought to obtain, and posses Iot.285

the mneans ofobtaining, any greater influence than that Which
superior virtue and piety confer.
6. The doctrine of hereditary right prevailed also throughoutt
Europe. By the fundamental regulations of nearly everykCingdom, the monarch and nobles transmitted to their eldest sons,
even though destitute of talents and virtue, their autho-vity,
privileges, and rank. The people often-saw on the throne moen,
-who- were guilty of the most atrocious wvickedness, and whose
conduct involved communities and nations in misery; but no
attempt could be made to remove or punish them without incurringr the penalty of rebellion. They saw also, in other exalted
stations, men equally, wicked and e(Lqually beyond their control.
7. The law of primnogeniture existed as a part ot the hUreditary system. The elest soti inh rited, not the title onlI, but
also all the lands of the father. By this unjust and unnatuml
law, the younger sons and the daughters were doomed to Coemparltive poverty. One port(n of the people was made rich and
ailother poor.  ew wxere placed in thathappy medium between
wealthi andt poverty, which is niost fav'oiable to virtue, to happitess and to the ihnprovemient of the huma'n faculties.
S. T'he principle, that power could be inherited, was at once
rejected by the first emlligrants to America.'They had witnessed,
in Eutrope, the pernicious operation of this principle; they
were convincel of its absurdity; and even had not such bere
the case, that equality of rankl alnd condition, which existed
among thel.m, would have prevented any one fiom claiminig such
a privllege for his family. nd all others from submitting to it
9. The law of primogeiiture fell of course into disuse 0o was
abolished. That equalit.v offrights and of rank, which prevailed
at first, has continued to prevail; and though, in some of the
colonies, the extravagant grants of land, which were made by
capricious governors to their ftvorites, introdutced great inequality of fortune, yet-the salutary operation:of various laws
is continually diminishing this iniequality, dividing and dis.
tributing among many that wealthl, which, when in the hanids
of a few, is less beneficial to the ptublic, and productive of less
individual enjoyment.  ~
10. Tile systems of government established in the colonies
were also departures from European precedents, and were in
perfect harmony with their socal. institutions. Most of the
provisions- of the early charters were doubtless suggested by
the first emigrants, and of course accorded with their lilieral
political principles. The kings, who gIanteil themn, conce(led
many prlvileges to encourage the settlement of colonies in
Ame?rica, enrte-taining no suspicion that their successors WOuldd
ever have occasion to regret their concessions. These c.harters made but little distinction in the riahts and( privileges of
the colonists. Every man couldcl regard those around him as
his equals. The state of individual dependenlce being hardly
known, ta.1l sense of dependei}ce on the mother country was
gradually lost; and the transitiosn from a colonial to an independent: condlition was natural and unavoiklable.,I I. In nothing is the contrast between the two systems of
government greater than in the requisitions, which they make
of the people, for their support and defence. That of Great
Britain may be taken as a favorable example of the European
overnrnents. The people of that kingdom pay annually, for the
support of their sovereign and his relativesd nearl two and a
half-millions of dollars, while the compensation of the president
of the United States is but twenty-five thousand. In the salaries
of the subordinate officers of government, the disproportion is
not so great, but is generally, nevertheless, as four or five to one.
12.  he military peace establishmnent of Great Britain costs
aninually thirty-four mnillions-of dollars that of the United
States hut little more than five mnillions. The naval establishiment of the former costs twenty-two millions; that of the
latter less than two and a half millions. British subjects pay
in taxes, raised exclusively for naticGnal purposes, at the rate
of fifteen dollars yearly foreach indlividual; the citizens of the
~~~~~~~~~,utiua;tiee~zesOtl
Unite( States pay, in national and state taxes, at the rate of but
two dollars. And as the whole population of Great Britain and
Ireland is included in the estimate, the individual wealth of the
subjects of the united kingdom, and of the citizens of the Ame.
rican republic, may, on an average, be considered nearly equal.
13. With burdens thus light, not embarrassed by too much
regulation, nor restricted by monopolies, but left at liberty to
pursue their own interests, as individual judgment may dictate
the citizens of the republic have bol(ly embarked in all the
ordinary pursuits of nian; and in all have met with a degree
of success, which exhibits a favorable and forcible commentary
upon their free institutions, and proves that no other people
surpass them in activity or enterprise.
14. In the pursuits of AGRICULTURE, by far the greates
portion of the inhabitants are engaged; and for that employment the country is most favorably situated.  It embraces
every desirable variety of climate. The soil is generally good;
in many parts of the union, it is exceedingly fertile; and it
produces, or may be madcle to produce, almost every vegetable
which can be used as the food of man, or as the material of
manufactures. The northern states produce Indian corn, rye
wheat, flax, hemp, oats, potatoes; and their pastures feed and
fatten large numbers of cattle and sheep. The middle and
western states produce tobacco, and the same articles as the
northern, but wheat in much greater abundance. In the southern states, cotton is principally cultivated, but considerable
quantities of rice and sugar are produced.
15. In 1820, the number of persons engaged in agriculture
was 2,070,646. The value of all its products exported durini
the year ending the 30th of September, 1823, was 37,646,000
dollars. The principle articles were, cotton to the value of
20.446,000 dollars; flour to the value of 4,962,000 dollars;
tobacco to the value of 4,852,000 dollars; and rice to the value
of 1,821,000 dollars. The value of provisions of all kinds
exported was 13,460,000 dollars, and it has, in many years
285
APPENDIX.APPENDIX.                        28X
been greater. A people able to spare such an amnount of th*
necessaries of life can never be in danger of suffering from want.
16. The agricultural class is conspicuous for industry, morality, and general intelligence; but has less professional knowledge
than the same class in Europe. Land havintg hitherto been
cheap, and not exhausted by cultivation, agriculturalists have
not been eager, and it has not been necessary, to make practical
application of the discoveries of science. A change in these
respects having taken place, especially in the Atlantic states,
many now study their profession as a science; and, as all professions are estimated according to the skill and intelligence
required to attain eminence in them, they are raising their
ow  nearer to that rank in society, to which the utility and
importance of agriculture entitle it. More taste and neatness
are displayed, and the appearance of the country is visibly and
rapidly improving.
17. The COnMmtRCr of the United States has yielded a rich
harvest of wealth. Various circumstances have directed to
this pursuit the attention of a large portion of the population,
and have contributed to their prosperity in it. For two thousand miles, the republic bounds upon the sea, and in that
space has nmany excellent harbors. The finest timber for ship
building is abundant, ald easily procured. Near the shores
of the nortlherr states, a(nd on the adjacent banks of Newfoundland, are fishing stations, unsurpassed by any in the
world. Fishing is consequently a lucrative employment, in
proportion to the capital invested, and attracts to it a large
number of the natives of those states. These becomne accustomied to a seatitring life, and soon pass into larger vessels,
destined for mire distant and perilous voyages.
18. T'he state of the world, for sevTeral years subsequent to
the coummencement of the French revolution, offered great encouragemnent to thOe commercial enterprise of the country. While
almost every other power was engaged in war, the United States
were neutral; their vessels navigated the ocean in safety, and
were employed to carry, from port to port, the commodities of
the belligerant nations. In fifteen years, beginning with 1793,
these favorable circunistances increased the amount of Amerioan tonnage from 491,000 to 1,242,000 tons, and the revenue
arising from commerce, from 4,399,000 to 16,363,000 dollars.
19. In 1820, tihe number of iersons engaged in commerce
was 72,493.   In 1823, the wnole amount of exports wa.s
74,799,000 dollars; the amounrlt of imports was 77,579,000
dollars, the ballance, in favor of the United States, being about
three millions of dollars. As the imports, however, are always
1undervalued at the custom-house, the additional wealth, whicl,
in that year, accrued to the nation tfroni coinmmerce, was un,
doubtedly greater.
2v0. Ill other years, the commerce of the country has flourishebd more. In 1807, the exports amounted to 1 8,3143,W)O
diollars, and the imports to 13-,.574,000 dollars. The principal
zauses of the declime whiclh has taken place, have been, therestoration of peace in Ellrope, and the increase of the -pro,
duct of domestic manutlfctures. The former has permitted all
other nations to become our competitors; the latter has rendered it ullIecessary to resort to Europe for most-of the conveniencies and many of the -luxuries.of life. The depression
will not long continie.. - The ind(lependence of the Soulh American republics has opencd.a wide field. fbr the enterprise of our
mnerchants,.and given a brighter hue to thleir future prospects.
21. The coD FISHSERY' on the north-eastern coast of America
attracted, at an early period, the attention of the world. Ir
1583, Sir Humphirey Gilbert found thlirty-six vessels fishing in
thle harbor of St. John, in N1ewfoundland. The we

many years, the P rench retained almost a monopoly of this
source of wealth. In 1744, they emiployed, in this fishery, 414
large sli-ps, nvigated lby about 24,000 seanlen, and the quani -
tity of fisli taken amnounted to 1,149,000 (quintals.

desolate coast. Sterile sands and gloomy forests were the
only objects that met tileir view. The severity of the
cold, greater than they had ever experienced, admonished
them to seek protection against it; and their first employment was the erection of huts in the most convenient and
sheltered situations.  In these miserable abodes they
passed the winter, those at least who survived it. By the
succeeding spring, one half of their number had perished,
exhausted by continual suffering, and by the privation of
every worldly comfort which they had been accustomed
to enjoy.
12. Their settlement was found to be within the limits
of the Plymouth company from which they solicited and
obtained a grant of land; but they were never incorporated
by the king. They called the place New-Plymouth.
They often received small additions to their number,
which, in 1630, amounted to three hundred.
13. In the mean timne, the same causes that drov-e Mr.
Robinson and his congregation from England had continued
to operate. A class of dissenters, denominated puritans
from the austerity of their manners, and from their claims
to superior purity in worship and discipline, had beconme
numerous; and as, by their new mode of worship, they
violated the laws of the land,they were prosecuted as criminals. Their faith was confirmed and their zeal increased
by their sufferings; and having learned that complete religious freedom ",as enjoyed at New-Plymouth, inAmerica,
they naturally directed their thoughts to that country, as a
secure asylum from persecution.
14. In 1627, an association of puritans, residingat Dorchester and the vicinity, was formed for the purpose of
planting a colony in New-England, to whichlthey and their
brethren might repair, and, in seclusion and safety, worship God according to the dictates of conscience. They
obtained from the Plymouth Company, a grant of the territory, which now constitutes a part of the state of Massachusetts, and sent over, under the direction of John Endicott, a small number of people, to begin a plantationr
These, in September, landed at a place called, by the Indians, Naumkeak, and, by themselves, Salem.
15. The next year, they obtained a charter from the
crown, by whichl the usual powers..,f a corporation were
conferred upon thle grantees, by the naaniof the'" Governor
and Company of Massachusetts Bay, in New-England."

use. The erection of slitting-mills was prohibited, and hatters
were forbidden to take any apprentice for less thai seven years
or to employ more than two at a time. In addition to these an

little attention was of course given to manufactures, and' the
inhabitants received theirsupptlies from the artizans of England.
30. Some attemnpts were however made, a few years previos
to the commencement of the revolutionary war, to introdLuce
manufactures. Such was in part the intention of the non.
importation agreements: and somie of the colonial legislatures
to encoutrage the production of wool, and the manufacture o?
cloths, exempted sheep from taxation. But, at no time pre.
vious to the adoption of the constitution, did manufac'turers
exist in the country in sutlicient number to be (,nsidLered a
class of the population.
31. And indeed it was not until the imposition of the enbargo, in 1807, that any considerable impulse was given to
this branch of industry. Prevented by this interrugtAno

houses, checked, for a few years, the impulse which the re
strictive measures and the war had given.  In each of the
three years following' 1815, the value of articles manufactured
was probably less than in any one of the preceding six ears.
From the year 181, the amount has gradually increase, and
in 1821 and 1822, it was probably greater than it had ever
before been. It will hereafter continue to increase, and the
navigation of the country will be employed, not so much in
bringing home the manufactures of other nations, as in carrying abroad those of the United States. In this way, dome
tic meanufactures will repay to commerce the capital they have
lately drawn from it.
33 The state in which the greatest attention is devoted to
this branch of industry, are Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New-.I ampshire ard Connecticut. The principal
manufactures are those of cotton and of woollen c ioths'
irong ad n  of leather. In 1820  the number of inhabitants

ufaetures is most productive of national wealth, and t which
the governmtent oulght, in preference, to extend its protection
and encouragement, has lately been warmly discussed, by the
politicians and writers orn political ecenomy, in Aerica, and
in Europe.  Each interest has hliad its adv,cates.  The  decision of the impartial statesman would probably be, that neither
should be encouraged to the neglect of the others; that if
either is, in any degree, to be preferred, it is that which is, at
the timrne, thie most depresseld; or that which Su plies most of
the -means of national defence, and most of the necessaries
and conveniencies of life.
35.. DEBT, REVENUE, and EXPENDITURES. When, in 1790,
the public debt was first funded, it amounted to about 75,000,00
of dollars. In 1803, by the purchase of Louisiana, it was
%ugmented to- about 85,500,000. In the eight years which
followed, a large amount was paid, leaving due, in 1812, but.ittle mnore than 45,000,000.' ro defray the expenses of' the
war, which was declared in that year, miore than 80,000,000
of new debt was contracted.'A large portiorl has since been
paid, and, on the first (lay of January, 1823, the amount of it
was 90,865,877 dollars.  
36. The present revenue of the republic is derived princi
pally, fromi commerce, and from the sale of public lands. In
1822, there- accrued from the formier source, the?sum of
2t0,50(,775 dollarsi from the latter source, 1,803,5811; and
froim other sources, 839,084. The ainount, however, whlich was
aectually received, during the year, was b,ut 20,232,427
37. rhe expenditures, dturing the same year, were as' follIws: Civil, dip)lomnatic, and miscellaneouls, 1,967 996; for
the pay and support of the arumyr, the construction o? forts, the
supply of arms, the payment of penrsions, a(nd the various expenses of the Indian department, 5,635,1t88; for the support
andl increase of the navy, 2,224,458; for tle paymient of the
interest, and for the redemption of that portion of the principal
of the debt which became due within the year, 7,848,949,
amounting in the whole to 17,676,591, and leavingg anIees
of revenue over expenditure of 2,555,836 dollars.
38. EDUCATION. In the kingdoms of Europe, large sums
have been appropriated, by the government, for the purposes
of education.  Nearly all, however, has been expended io
funding or endowing unliversities. To these thte sons of the
noble and the rich could alone gain access; and the intention
and effect of the expenditure has always been, to produce
erudite scholars and able orators, and to perpetuate and widen
the separationi between the higher aint the lower classes of
the population.  
39. The people of the United States have had a different
object in view, and one more congenial with their political institutions. Desirous that none shiould be ignorant, their first
and principal care has been, to impart the advantages of instruction to the whole mass of the population. With this
view, the legislatures of many of the states have ordained thatschools, for the education of all the youth in reading, writing
and arithmetic, shall be kept, and supported by a public and
general tax.                       -  
40. This system  was adopted in Massaclusetts as early as
-1647. A law was then passed, by that colony, providing that
a school should bc kept in every township havinig fifty house.
holders, in which all the children, who might resort to it,
_should be taught to read and write. As the number of inhabitants increased, the townships were divided- into small
districts, and a school supported in each. Thus, the means
of education were provided, at the public expense, and the
opportunity of acquiring it placed within the power of all.
41. nImmediately after their first settlemeint the same system
was adoptedl by the other coloniies of NeW-ngland; and it
has, by a1ll of them, been preserved and cherished to the ore
sent timie. Connecticut, having a large tract of land in Ohio,
Which was sold for 1,200,000 dollars, appropriated the whoIle
sui to -the support of coimmon or primary schools. The sum
has since been augmented to 1,700,000 dollars, andl the interest is annually distributed to the several school districts,
according to the number of scholars taught in each.  No dirtrict, however, is entitled to any aid fromri this fund, unle.ss it
had, in the preceding year, expended, for the same purpose, a
certain a inounit derived from its own resoutrces.
42. The effect of this s,stem has been, to render the great
body of the people of thesi states the imiost emlighteied in the
workl. All can read anid write, and rarely can one be found
not qualified, by education, to transact the colmmon concerns
of life. To educate his clildren. is thle first object, and the
chief glory of the parent; thleir ifmorance is to him anJ to
thnm Adisgracefutl. In these schools, thle human mind receives
its first imnpulse in the-career of learnina; an-impulse which
carries-many forward to high stations of h(inor'and of useitrlness.
43. T he great state of New-York, distinguished fot-magnificent projects of internial iniprovement, and for liberal patron.
age-of literature anl the arts, has lately adopted a system nearly
similar to that of Connecticut. Fromin various sources, it has
accumulated a fund, the income of which is to be applied annually to the support of common schools.:This fund, in 1820,
amounted to 1,215,000 dollars.  Since that year, all the unsold anid uiiappropriated lands, which, when disposed of, will
probably produce about one million more, have-been permanently devoted to the same object. The annual iterest of
this find is distributed, according to population, among the
several townships, on their raising, forthe same purpose, an
additional sum equal to that which they receive from the state.
In 1821, three hundred and thirty-three thousand -children were
taught, min the several district schools  a aumber nearly equal
to that of all the children in the state between five and fifteen
years of age. In I823, the number taught was 400,000.
44. Virginia has also a literary fund, the interest of A part
of which is. appropriated to the support of common schools.
M9t
APPENhDIX.This fund is of recent origin, and its income is yet small.
The advantages of education are, however, so highly appreciated in that state, by its enlightened citizens, that most of the;
rising generation are instructed in private schools, or by-domestic teachers. The same remark will apply to most of the
middle and southern states; yet, in: these, too many of the
children of the poor will remain in ignorance until effectual
provision is made, by the respective governments, for the instruction of all.
45. The national government has not been unmindful of the
importance of universal education. Before the adoption of
the corstitution, it acquired, by the cession of-the states claiming it, the property of nearly all the unappropriated land within
the national boundaries. Ill offering this land for sale, it has
reserved, in every township, one sectlon, comprising 640 acres,
for the use of scho)ls. As the population of the new states
becomes more dense, these lands will constitute a valuable
and productive find, and the system of free schools, thus
planted in the western, will there produce the same benefits
as in the eastern portion of the union.
46, Schools of a higher order, to which the name of academies has-beei applied are.umerous in all the states, especially
in those of New-England., Many are incorporated, and some
possess considerable funds. That at Exeter, in New-Hamp.
shire, holds the highest rank; its ftinds aniount to 80,000
dollars; it has a library containing 700 volumnes, and a hand.
some philosophical apparatus. In these schools are taught
English grammar, comnposition, history, geography, mathe.
matits, the Latin and Greek languages. Many young men
resort to them to acquire an education superior to that which
can be obtained at the primary schools, and many to prepare
themnselves to enter some college or university. Thiey are
principally tauight by those, who have just received a degree
in the arts, and who are unable, from the want of property,
to engage immediately in the study of the professions which
they intend to pursue.
47. Of colleges and universities there is also a large number
in the United States. The oldest and first in rank S:Harvard
College, at Cambridge, Massachusetts.  It wasa established in
1638, only eighteen years after:the first settlement of Plymouth.
It had then a fund of about 5,000 dollars, nearly two thirds of
which was a donation from the Rev. John Harvard, of Charlestown. The first degrees were conferred, upon nine young
gentlemen, in.1642. It has since received many and large
additions to its funds, principally donations from ind(lividuals;
and, from the exertions of its learned presid(lents and professors, has, with short intermissions, been constantly advancing
in reputation, and increasing in usefulness. The library contains about twen~'-five thousand volumes. In 1824, the faculty
consisted.of a president, and twenty professors; the number
of students was 22, and of the resident graduates 146.
48. Yale College was founded. in 1700, and incorporated in
T3
293APPENDIX.29t                    APPENDIX-.
1701. It was first established at Saybrook; but, in 1716,
was removed to New-Haven, in Connecticut. Elihiu Yale, a
merchant in London, havinig mtade to it a donation of more
than four thousand( dollars, its nam`e was, in 1718, changed
from  the Collegiate School, to Yale College. -Afl:erwards
bishop. Berkeley, the celebrated nmetaphysician, who had( refided two years in America, presented to it a collection of
looks, consisting of nearly one thousand volumes; and a fiarm
in Newport, the annual rent of which, on a lIng ldase, is two
hundred asid forty bushels of wheat. From  the state, and
from other sources, it has received many liberal donations.
Its libraries contain about nine thousand volunmes. In 1824
the faculty consisted of a president, anId eleven professors, and
the number of its students was 349..      -
49. In addition to these, there are, in the union, abiout fifty
colleges and universities authorized to copfer degrees. In all
of these are taught, the Englishl, Latin, and Greek languages,
rhetoric, nmathematics, niatural philosophy, logic,:chyrnistry,
astrononmy, history, and geography. In some of them are also
taughlt the Hebrew, oriental, arnd niodern European languages;
anatomy, surgery, medicine, botany, polite literature, divinity,
ethics, natural ald municipal law, politics,- and elocution.
50. LITERATURE. -The renmark hlas ofteqy Been made, that
the United States have prod(luced no eminent scholars; and
that the national character has not been illustrated by literary
and scientific performances of distinguished nwerit. This reniark is doubtless just. Compared witli thlose of the old world,
thleir writers have not exhibited the salme labore(d polish of
style, nor their men of science the samie perseverance and
extent of: investigation. Their historians are not equal to
Hume or Robertson; their poets to Milton or Pope; their
chymlist.s to Lavoisier or Davy; nor their mietaphysicians to
Locke, Berkeley, or Reid..
51. But this fact implies no (deficiency of mental vifgor in
the people. The mind of the nation has received, from cir
cumstances, a different direction.  Those who are endued
with extraordinary talent, whlatever may have been their original propensities, have been called from the closet to labor in
the legislative hall, or the cabinet; to vindicate tlihe cause or
defen(d the interest of their coluntry abroad; to dispense justice fronm the bench, or to support and defend, at tthe bar, tlhe
claims and the rights of their fellow citizens.
52. To perform these dutics, certainily not less.honorable
nor less difficult than any thing which the mere scholar canll
pertform, a greater variety of talents, and greater intellectual
labor, hlave been required in this than ii any other country.
Here, in comparatively a short period, the foundations have
been laid, and the superstructures erected of new political
institutions. - Many governments have bet v established over
communities differi'ig fromi each other, and from those of

ties, a new system of law has been required, and each government has a separate executive, legislative, and judicial department. The population of no country has been called upon to
supply such a number of legislators, of judges, and of lawyers;
nor, it may be added, of instructors of youth,- And, while
ihelr number accounts for the comparative neglect of literature
and the fine arts, the talenrts they have displayed sufficiently
vindicate the republic from the reproach of intellectual infetiority.
53. But not in these modes alone have the people of these
states proved, that in original powers of mind they may assert
an equality, at least, with those of any other nation. None
has mnade more important discoveries in the useful arts. England boasts of her Arkwright, who invented the spinning
machine; of her Worcester, Newcomen, and Watt, by whose
ingenuity and labors the powers of steam were substituted for
the uncertain aid of wind and water in moving.the machinery
of mnanufactories.
54. America may boast of her Godfrey, whose quadrant
has been ahlnost as serviceable, as the compass, to navigation;
of her Franklin, who has made our dwellings comfortable
within, and protected them from the lightning of heaven; of
her Whitney, whose cotton gin has added to the annual pro
duct of that article at least one hunired millions of pounds
of her Whittemore, tihe inventor of the wonderful machine for
making cards; of her Perkins, the inventor of the nail machine; and of her Fulton, who has rendered the power of
steam subservient to the purposes of navigation.
55. But the United States have produced authors who
would do honor even to any other nation. The style of
Franklin is perspicuous and pure; and few men of any age
ar country have contributed more by their writings, to entighten and to benllefitt imankind. The histories of Marshall,
Rtamsay, Belklnap, Williams, and the Annals of Holmes, are
works of sterling merit, interesting, and instructive. Among
theological writers, Edwards, Hopkins, Dwight, Lathrop,
Davies, Kollock, and Buckminster, are deservedly eminent
And as a novelist Brown has few equals.
56. Many of the political writers of this country have displayed great vigor of thought, and force of expression. The
painmphlets and state papers to which the revolutionary struggle
yave existence; -the numbers of the Federalist; the official
ietters of Mr. Jefferson, as secretary of state, and of the American ministers at Ghent, not only display intellectual powers,
but possess literary merit, of the highest order. Some of the
best writers of this republic have not been the authors of
books.
57. To the fine arts still less attention has been paid than
to literature; but the neglect is to be attributed rather to the
deficiency of patronage than to the want of capacity to excel.

years over the Royal Society, comprising the most emineO

of patronizing and instructing them.
58, RELIGION. The consequences resulting from the enjoymnent of religious liberty hiave been hig]Ily favorable. Free
discussion has enlightened the ignorant disarmed superstition
Pf its dreadful powers, and coiisigned to oblivion many erroneous arid fantastic creeds. Religious, oppression, and the
vindictive feelings it arouses, are hardly known. Catholics
tnd Protestants live together in harmony.; and protestants
who disagree, employ, in defending their own doctrines, and
min assaling,those of their a tagonsts t ls  weapons only of
rae.son and eloquence.         o      t

over a vast extent of territory, co. d lot inmediately assimi-;,te and exhibit those few prominent traits, which nations as
wvell a's individuals, in their maturity, display.
61. But thc germ of a natioqqal character has always existed,
It has grown with our growth, and is gradually throwing into
$   h3 ahamie those unfavorable and discordant traits, which have
disfigured and partly concealed it from view. Who, that has
reaM the history ot these states, has not perceived, in the inhabitants, an energy of purpose capable of surmounting all
obstacles; a spirit of enterprise, that leaves nothing useful
unattempted; a proud sense of personal dlignity and independence; a decided preference of utility beftre show; and a
love of knowledge that has dispelled ignorance from the land!
They may have been too much devoted to the pursuit of gain;
too much addicted to habits of intemperance; too much inflated with national vanity; bigoted and superstitious: but

63. A review of the rapid progress of the United States in
populatioin, wealth, and power; a survey of their present
physical and moral condition; and. comparison of them, in
either respect, with other nations, cannot fail to give to an
American citizen an elevated conception of his own country,
anl to justify the loftiest anticipations of tile future.
64. tn a peeriod of thirty years, ending with 1820, the
population of the repul)lic increased from  3,893,835, to
9,642,150; it consequently dloubles irt less than twenty-five
eals. In Great Britain the population does not double in
than eighty years; a-nd in that country the increase is
nearly,.if not quite, as rapid as in any other country in Europe.
65. The augmentatioll of wealth and power cannot be so
easily aseertained. It is the opinion of nmany, well quglified
to judge, that it has beeni still more rapid; arnd when the increase of our expofts, which in the samne period advanced from
nineteen to sixty-five millionsf; when the gronwth of olur cities

Governor, a deputy Governor, and eighteen assistants, to
be named, in the first instance, by the crown, and afterwards elected by the corporation. Four stated meetings
of all the members were to be held annually, under the
denomination of the General Court, at which they were
authorised to admit freemen or members, and to make
such ordinances or laws, not repugnant to the laws of
England, as they might deem expedient. The colonists,
and their descendants, were declared to be entitled to all
he rights of natural born English subjects.
16. At a General Court, held at London, in 1629, the
officers prescribed by the charter, were elected, and several ordinances were adopted for the government of the
company. Three hundred people were sent over, of whom
one hundred, dissatisfied with the situation of Salem, removed to Charlestown. Religion was the first object of
their care in. the country they had adopted. A religious
covenant was agreed upon, and a confession of faith drawn
up, to which their assent was given. Pastors were chosen,
and were, from necessity, installed into their sacred offices
by the imposition of the hands of the brethren.
17. The ensuing winter was a period of uncommon suffering and sickness. The cold was intense; the houses
were unfinished; the provisions were insufficient and unwholesome.  Before spring, nearly half their number
perished, "lamnenting that they could not live to see the
rising glories of the faithful."
18. These calamnities had some effect in deterring others
from joining them; but the consideration that the general
courts were held, the officers elected, and the laws enacted,
in London, had still greater influence. It did not comport
with the views and feelings of those who disdained to
submit to authority in mnatters of faith, to consent to remove to the new world, and there be governed by laws
which they could have no part in enacting. Representations to this effect were made to the company, who resolved that the government and patent should be removed
to Massachusetts.
19. This wise resolution gave such encouragement ta
emigration, that, in 1630, more than fifteen hundred persons came over, and founded Boston and several adjacent
towns. Of these persons, all were respectable, and many
were from illustrious and noble ifamilies. Having been
accustomed to a life of ease and enjoyment, their sufferings,
the first year, were great, and proved fatal to many; amona

ethers, to the lady Arabella, who, to use the words of an
early historian of the country, "came from a paradise of
plenty and pleasure, in the family of a noble earl, into a
wilderness of wants; and although celebrated for her many
virtues, yet was not able to encounter the adversity she
was surrounded with; and, in about a month after her arrival, she ended her days at Salem, where she first landeJ." Mr. Johnson, her husband, overcome with grief,
survived her but a short time.
20. Before December, two hundred perished. On the
24th of that month, the cold became intense. Such a
Christmas-eve they had never before known. Yet the inclemency of the weather continued to increase. They
were almost destitute of provisions; and many were obliged
to subsist on clams, muscles, and other shell fish, with
nuts and acorns instead of bread. Many more died; but
in this extremity, that ardor of conviction which compelled them to emigrate, remained in filll force, and they
met, with a firm, unshaken spirit, the calamities which
assailed them.
21. One great object of the puritans, in retiring to the
unoccupied regions of New-England, was the establishuient of a religious commonwealth, as nearly upon the
model of that of the Jews as the difference of circumstances would admnit. To accomnplish this object, they
deemed it necessary, and at a general court, held in 1631,
they ordained, that none but those who had made a profession of religion, and had become members of some
church, should be admitted members of the corporation, or
enjoy the privilege of voting.
22. This law h'as been too severely censured by those
who have lived in more liberal and enlightened times. It
contradicted none of the professions of the puritans. It
was in strict accordance with the avowed motives of their
emigration. It exhibited less intolerance than was then
displayed by every other nation. It violated the rights of
no one, for no one could claim a right to come into the
territory which they had purchased. And it was doubtless
essential, such was then the temper of men's minds, to
the repose of their little society.
23. The colonists had frequently been alarmed, but nev.
er yet attacked, by the Indians. These were not, in fact,
in a condition to do much injury. A few years before theo
arrival of the English, a contagious distemper swept away
a great number, almost exterminating soveral tribes. Ia

tially made vacant for their reception. As an attack from
this quarter was, however, possible, and as the French,
who'had a trading establishment at Acadia, lhad discoverel
some symptoms of' hostility, it was thougiht advisable te
erect fortifications at Boston, and other places, and to ope.~
a correspondence with their neighbours at New-Plymouth.
24. So far froni the capital had the settlements extended, that it was found extreniely inconvenient for all the
freemen to assemble and transact the niecessary public
business. In 1634, the mode of legislation was altered,
by the general consent of the towns. They delegated to
twenty-four representatives the authority granted, by the
charter, to the whole body of freemen. This im-portant
alteration was adopted the more readily, as the emnigrants
had been familiar, in their native country, with the representative systemr.  The appellation of General Court,
which had been applied to all the freemen when assembled;
was now transferred to their representatives.
25. In the same year, Roger Williams, the minister of
Salem, having occasioned disturbances, by advancing tenets considered not only heretical but seditious, and bei-ng
found irreclaimable, was ordered to leave the colony. He
retired to Rehoboth, which was then within thle jurisdiction of Plymouth.
26. In 1635, Massachusetts received from England a
large number of inlab-.tants, and among them came two
who afterwards acted conspicuous paits in the affairs of
their native country. One was Hugh Peters, who was
subsequently a chlaplain of Oliver Cromwell; the other was
Mr. Vane, afterwards Sir Henry Vane. The latter was but
twenty-fiv-e years of age; but by his show of great liumility,
his grave and solemn deportment, and his ardent professions of attachment to liberty, he stole the hearts of the
puritans, and, the year-after his arrival, was made governor
of the colony.
27. His popularity, however, was transient. During
hlis admninistration, the celebrated Mrs. Hutchinson, a
womrn who was distinguished for her eloquence, and had
imbibed the enthusiasm of the age, instituted weekly
meetings for persons of her own sex, in which she c&lt;m-.
rnented.on the sermons of the preceding Sunday, and adv;mced certain mystical and extravagant doctrines. r'lieseMASSACHUSETTS.  
epread rapidly among the people, and many became con.

28. Governor Vanef with Mr. Cotton and Mr. WheeIl
wright, two distinguishied clergymen, embraced them with
ardor; but lieutenant governor Winthlrop, and a majority
of the churches, deemed them hleretical and seditious.
Great excitement was pr-duced among the people; many
conferences were hleld; public fasts were appointed; a
general synod was summoned; and after muchl intemperate discussion, hler opinions were deternmined to be erroneous, and she and some of hter adherents were banished
fiom the colony.
29. Not being again chosen governor, Vane returned in
disgust to England, engaged in the civil wars, which soon
ater afflicted that country, sustained high offices in the
republican party, and, after the restoration of Charles II,
was accused of high treason, convicted and executed.
Peters pursued a sinlilar career, and met_w'th the same fate.
30. In suchI highl repute, at thlis time, were the settlempit.s in Massach:setts, that other Engishnmen, still more
conspicuous, hai determiined to leave their native land,
that they might enljoy, in a desert, the civil and religious
liberty whlich was denied them at home. Among these
w-ere Mr. Hambden,, Sir Arthur Haselhig, and Oliver
C(romwell, whomn king Charles, by express order, (letained,
when on the point of embarkling. Little did hle imagine
that, by this act of arbitrary power, he kept within his
kingdom those restless vytaries of freedoTrn, who w-ere desiined to overtu rn his throne, and bring his head to the block.
31. By the settlement of Massachusetts, the attention
of emigrants was diverted from the colony of Plymouth,
where the soil was less fertile. It nevertheless continued
to increase, althoug1 slowly, in population. In 1633, the
government of that colony built a trading house, near Hartford, which was the first building erected within the boundaries of Connecticut. Soon after, many persons repaired
thither from Massachusetts. In 1636, ROger'Williams laid
the foundation of Rhlode Island. Subsequently, New-Hatmpshire and New-Haven were founded, which increased to
five the numrnber of colonies in New-England.
32. The rapid progress of the English settlements, excited the jealohsy of the natives. They had welcomed,
withlout fear, the emigrants -who irst landed, not anticipating their future encroachments. IThe cexperience of aMASSACHUSETTS.
few years convinced them that they must either exterminate these invaders of their country, or be themselves exterminated.
33. Within the boundaries of Rhode Island and Con.
necticut, lived two warlike tribes, the Pequods and Narragansets. The former were hlostile, the latter friendly,
to the whites. Between the two tribes an inveterate enmity existed; but the more sagacious and politic Pequods
proposed that all animosities should be forgotten, and-their
united strength directed against their invaders, before they
had become too strong to be resisted. At first the Narragansets wavered, but their hatred of the Pequods overpowered the suggestions of policy. They disclosed the
proposal to the English, and invited them to join in a was
against their common enemy.
34. The colonies were roused to a sense of their danger. In 1637, Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut,
agreed to unite their forces, and attempt the entire destruction of the Pequods. Captain Mason, with eighty
men, principally fromn Connecticut, and ttiree hundred
friendly Indians, was immediately sent into the country
of the enemy. Early in the morning of the 26th of May,
he attacked one of the lprincipal villages, which had neen
surrounded with pallisades. The resistance w'as brave
and obstinate, and the issue of the battle for soine time
doubtful; buLt the whites, forcing their way into the enclosure, set fire to the wigwams, and then, retreating a
short distance, surrounded the town. Manay of the Indians perished in the flames; others were shot, in their
attempts to flee. Of five or' six hundred, within the enclosure, but few escaped. The English troops, of whom
two were killed anid sixteen wounded, returned in triumph
to Hartford.
35. In'June, another body of troops, principally from
Massachusetts, marched into the enemy's country, surreonded a swamp, into which a party of them had retired,
and took eighty captive. Some escaping, they were pursued to another swamp, situated near New-Haven, where
the whole strength of the tribe was collected. This was,
in like manner, surrounded; a sharp contest ensued; but
the whites were again victorious. Two hundred Pequods
were killed c: made prisoners. The reinainder fled to the
country of tne Mohawks. The brilliant success of the
English,- in this first and short wai with the'-natives, gave:34MASSACHUSETTS
the neighboring tribes such an exalted idea of their
prowess, that, for nearly forty years, they were neither
attacked nor molested.
36. Ten years had now elapsed since the first settlement was mnade at Salem. It hlas been comrnputed that,
within that time, twenty-one thousand persons arrived in
Massachusetts. The dissenters in England having obtained the ascendency in the government, all motives fox
emigration ceased; and it is supposed that, for many years
afterwards, more persoiis returned to England, than carne
from England to the colonies.
37. Such, however, were the character and virtues of
the emigrants; such the power over difficulties which
their resolute minds, and bodies hardened by labor, had
imparted to them, that they continued to increase, with
astonishing rapidity, in wealth and numbers. And a vote
of the house of commons, stating that "the plantations in
New-England had had good and prosperous success, withoutt any public charge to the state," is quioted, by a historian
of those -times, as an honorable testimony of the highnierit of the colonists.
38. Circumstances and events had already impressed a
character uponI themn, which, thouoghl softened in its worst
featires by the progress of refinement, still distinguishes
their descendants. Persecution miade theni bigots; piety
ma(le them m0ral; poverty made them itrutgal; incessant
toil made themn hardy and robust; dreary solitudes made
themn gloomy and superstitious; their numerous clergy and
well educated leaders, made them venerate literature and
the sciences.
39. Four of the New-England colonies, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Plymouth, and New-l-faven, apprehending
danger from the Indians, from the Dutch, at New-York,
and from the French, at Acadia- formed, in 1643, a firm and
perpetual league, rfre lsive and defensive. By the articles
of this league, ea. ht. colony was to appoint two commissioners, who were to assemble, by rotation, in the respective
colonies, and were empowered to enact ordinances of general
concern; and, in case of invasion, each colony was bound,
upon the application of three imagtristrates of the invaded
colony, to furnish a stipulated proportion of men and money.
49. Strengthened by this league, the colonies were rospected by their civilized and savage neighbors. With
the French, under D'Aul,ley, Massachusetts had a long
and troub!csomie dispute; which was adjusted, intt 1614, by
35MASSACHUSETTS.
a treaty madeby governor Endicott, and afterwards ratified
by the commissioners.
41. When (representatives were first chosen, they sat
and voted in the same chamber with the assistants. In
1635, when Mr. Hooker applied for permission to form a
settlement ont Connecticut river, a majority of the assistants voted against'grailting permission; but a majority of
the whole assembly in favor of it. The representatives
contended that a majority of the assistants was not necessary, and that the vote had passed in the affirmative.
The assistants claimed to be a distinct branch of the legislature, and contended that it had passed in the negative.
42. No provision having been made for a case of this
kind, an adjournment, for a week, took place; a public fast
was appointed, and thedivine direction implored in all the
congregations. XVhen the assembly-again met, a sermon
was, preached, by Mr. Cotton, which induced the - representatives to yield to the claim of the assistants. In 1644
the dispute was renewed, and the assistants were again
victorious. The representatives then proposed that the
two classes should sit apart, and form distinct bodies, and
in this proposition the assistants concurred.
43. The contest between the king and parliament, at
length resulted in open war; and the New-England colonies, actuated by the same feeling as the puritans in England, emnibraced, with ardor, the cause of the latter. The
parliament rewarded this attachment, by exempting them
from all taxes; and when the supreme authority devolved
upon Cromwell, as protector of the liberties of England,
they found in him a friend no less sincere and zealous.
44 After the conquest of Ireland, he invited them to
return and settle in that country; and, subsequently, having
conquered Jamaica, he endeavored to persuade them to
remove to that fertile ishland, and more genial climate. But
his arguments and solicitations were unava.ling. They
enjoyed, in their present abode, complete religious freedom, and that privilege they were unwilling to hazard in
pursuit of advantages less essential to their happiness.
45. In 1641, the settlements of New-Hampshire were
incorporated with Massachusetts. And, in 1652, the inhabitants of the province of Maine were, at their own request, taken under her protection. - This province had
been granted to Sir Ferdinand Gorges, who, in 1639, first
established a government over it. In 1640, a general
coUrt was held at Saco. Upon the death of the proprietoo,MASSACHUSETTS.                     37
in 1649, most of the officers whom he had appointed, de.
serted it, and the people found it necessary to resort elsewhere for protection.
46. In 1656, several Quakers arrived in the colony. In
this acge-of enthusiasts, these sectarians partook of the
all-pervading enthusiasm. The behavior of some of
them, moved as they doubtless supposed by a divine impulse, gave great offence to the rigid puritans. For their
conduct, inconsistent with the high respect which was
thought to be due to magistrates and ministers, they were
first imprisoned and then banished. A law was passed
prohibiting Quakers from coming into the colony, imposing
the penalty of banishment upon the first offence, and of
death upon such as should return after banishment. Four,
who were so excitedas to return and obtrude themselves
upon the notice of the government, suffered the death
which they appeared to seek. This cruel, unjust, and
impolitic law was soon afterwards repealed.
47. Cromwell, who had governed England with greater ability and higher merit than most of her kings, died
in 1658, and after an interval of two years, Charles II.,
a prince destitute of honor and virtue, was recalled from
exile and placed upon the throne. He was reluctantly
acknowledged by the colonies of New-England. They
had been the favorites of the parliament, and the proteotor, and apprehended, with good reason, the loss of their
civil and religious privileges.
48. A slort time after, Whalley and Goffe, two of the
judges who had sentenced Charles I. to be beheaded, having fled before the return of his successor, arrived in NewEngland. Their first place of residence was Cambridge
but they often appeared pulblicly in Boston, particularly on
Sundays and other days of religious solemnities. They
had sustained high rank in Cromwell's armry, were men
of uncommon talents, and by their dignified manners and
grave deportment, commnanded universal respect.
49. As soon as it was known that they were excepted
from the general pardon, the governor suggested to the
court of assistants the expediency of arresting them. A
majority opposed it, and many members of the general
court gave them assurances of protection. Considering
themselves, however, unsafe at Cambridge,they removed
to New-Ilaven, where they were received with great respect by the clergy and magistrates.
50. After a short residence there, enjoying, in private,
the society of their flriends. the governor of Massach,itsette
c32$"       -MASSACHUSEqLTS.
received a mandate to arrest them. A warrant was im'
mediately issued, authorising two zealous loyalists to
search for, and seize them, wherever found, in New-England. They hastened to the colony of New-Haven, ex
hibited the warrant to the governor, who resided at Guilford, and requested him to furnish authority and assistants
to pursue them. Desirous of favoring the exiles, he affected to deliberate until the next morning, and then utterly
declined actinrg officially, without the advice of his council.
51. In the mean time, they were apprized of their danger, and retired to a new place of concealment. The pursuers, on arriving at New-Haven, searched every suspected house, except the one where the judges wyere concealed. This they began to search, but were induced, by
the address of the mistress of it, to desist. When the
pursuers had departed, the judges, retiring into the woods,
fixed their abode in a cave.
52. Havingthere heard that their friends were threatened with punishment, for having afforded them protection,
they came from their hiding place for the purpose of delivering themselves up; but their friends, actuated by feielings equally n6ble and; generous, persuaded them to relinquish their intention. Soon after, they removed to Milford, where they remained about two years.
53. Upon the arrival of other persons, instructed to apprehend them, they riepaired privately to HIadley, in Massachusetts, where they resided fifteen or sixteen years,
but few persons being acquainted with the place of their
concealment. I'here is, in that neighborhood, a tradition,
that many years afterwards two graves were discovered
in the minister's cellar; and in these, it was supposed,
they-had been interred. At New-Haven, two graves are
shown, said to be those of the two judges. It is not improbable that their remains were removed to this place from
Hadley.
54. A singular incident whllich occurred at the latter
place, in 1675, shows that one of these illustrious exiles
had not forgotten the avocations of his youth. The people,
at the time of public wcrship, were alarmed by an attack
from the Indians, and thrown into the utmost confusion.
Sluldderly, a grave, elderly person appeared; differing in his
mien and dress from  all around himn. He put himsell' at
their head, rallied,&gt;encouraged, and lbd them against the
enemy, who were repulsed and completely defeated. As
suddenly, the deliverer of Hadley disappeared. The peopleMASSACHUSETTS.
were lost in amazement, and many verily believed that an
angel sent from heaven had led them to victory.
55. Their treatmnent of the king's judges, and in truth
all their conduct, evinced the republican spirit of the colonists. By the royal government of England, they could
not, therefbre, be regarded with favor. In 1663, it was
enacted, that no European comilmo(lity should be imported
into thlle colonies, unless shipped directly from England,
and in British vessels. By thtis regulation, in connection
with others that had been previously made, all the trade
of the colonies was secured to, the mothe' country. They
suitmitted reluctantly to these restrictions, and often made
them the subject of complaint. But England, believing
that they augmented her wealth and power, obstinately
refused to repeal them.
56. In 1664, the king despatched four commissioners
to visit the severalcolonies in New-England, to examine
into lteir condition, to hear and decide comnplaints, and to
make to him a report of their proceedings and observatiotns
This measure was dictated by no friendly motive, and was
considered hy the colonies as a violation of their chlarters.
57. The first session of thie commissioners was at Plyriouth, where hut little business was transacted; the next
in Rhode Island, where the  heard complaints fromn the
Indians, and all who were discontented, atnd made divers
determinations respecting titles to land, which were but
little regarded. In Massachusetts, the general court complied with such of their requisitions as they thought proper; but, professing sincere loyalty to his majesty, declined
acknowledging their authority, and protested against the
exercise of it withini tiheir limits.
58. In consequence of this manly assertion of their
chartered rights, an angry correspondence took place between themn, at the close of which the commissioners petulantly told the general court, "that they would lose no
more of their labors upon thlem," but would represent their
conduct to his majesty.
59. From Boston, the commissioners proceeded to New.
Hampshire, where they exercised several acts of government, and offered to release the inhabitants from the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. This offer was almost unanimously rejected. In Maine, they excited more disturbance.
They encouraged the people to declare themselves independent, and found many disposed to listen to their suggestions; but Massachusetts, by a prompt and vigorous

exertion of power, constrained the disaffected to submit to
her authority.
60. Connllecticut appears to have been the favorite of the
commnissioners. She treated them with respect, and complied with their requisitiolls. In return,'they made such
a representation of her merits to the king, as to draw from
him a letter of thanks. "Although," says he, "your car
riage doth of itself most justly deserve our praise and ap
probation, yet it'seems to be set off with more lustre by
the contrary behavior of the colony of Massachusetts." -
61. At the end of fifty years from the arrival of the
emigrants at Plymouth, the New-England colonies were
supposed to contain one hundred and twenty towns, and
as many thousand inhabitants. The acts of parliament
not being rigidly enforced, their trade had become extensive and profitable. The habits of industry and economy
which had been formed in less happy times, continued to
prevail, and gave a competency to those who had nothing,
and wealth to those who had a competency. The wilderness receded before adventurous and hardy laborers, and
its savage inhabitants found their game dispersed, and
their favorite haunts invaded.  
62. This was the natural consequence of the sales of
land, which were, at all times, readily made to the whites.
But this cousequence the Indians did not foresee; and
when they felt it in all.Jits force, the strongest passions
were awakened which can animaite civilized or sava'e
man, the love of country and of independence.
63. A leader only was wanting to concentrateand direct
their exertkons, and Philip, of Pokanoket, sachem of a
tribe living within the boundaries of Plymouth and Rhode
Island, assumed that honorable, but dangerous, station.
His father was thle friend, but he had ever been the enemy, of the whites; and this enmity, arising from causes
of national concern, had been embittered to vindictive hatred by their conduct towards his elder brothler. This
brother, being suspected of plotting against them, was
seized by a detachment of soldiers, and confined; and the
indignity so wrought upon his proud spirit, as to produce a
fever that put an end to hislife.
64. Philip inherited the authority and proud spirit of his
brother. He exerted all the arts of intrigue, and powers
of persuasion, of which he was master, to induce the Indians, in all parts of New-England, to unite their efforts

ing a confederacy, able to send into action between three
and four thousand warriors.
65. The English were apprized of the plots of the Indians, and made preparations to meet their hostilities.
They hoped, however, that the threatened storm would
pass by, as others had, and that peace would be preserved.
But the insolence of Philip, and the number of his adherents, increased daily; and, in June, 1675, some of them
entered the town of Swanzey, in Plymouth, where, after
slaughtering the cattle, and plundering the houses, they
tired upon the inhabitants, killing and wounding several.
66. The troops of that colony marched immediately to
Swanzey, and were soon joined by a detachment from
Massachusetts. T'he Indians fled, and marked the course
of their flight by burning the buildings, and fixing on poles,
by the way side, the hands, scalps, and heads of the whites
whom they had killed. The troops pursued, but unable to
overtake them, returned to Swanzey.
67. The whole country was alarmed, and the number of
troops augmented. By this array of force, Philip was induced to quit his residence at Mount Hope, and take post
near a swamp at Pocasset, now Tiverton. At that place,
the English attacked him,- but were repulsed. Sixteen
whites were killed, and the Indians, by this success, were
made bolder.
68. At this time, most of the settlements were surrounded by thick forests, and the Indians lived intermixed
with the whites. The former were acquainted, of course,
with the dwellings of the latter, with their roads, and
places of resort; could watch their motions, and fall upon
them in their defenceless and unguarded moments. Many
were shot dead as they opened their doors in the morning; rmany while at work in their fields, and others while
travelling to visit their neighbors, or places of worship.
At all times, at all places, in all employments, were their
lives in jeopardy; and no one could tell but that, in the
next moment, he should receive his death shot from his
barn, the thicket, or the way side.
69. Whenever the enemy assembled in force, detachinents were sent against them; if weaker than these, they
would retreat; if stronger, assault and conquer them.
Defenceless villages were suddenly attacked, the houses
burned, and the men, women, ana children killed, or carq
tied into captivity. Their ruin was the work of a ma
ment; and when accomplished, its authors vanished9

70. -The colonies, losing individuals,'families and villages, found their numbers sensibly diminished; their
strength iipaired; and began to apprehend even total extinc'tion. Nothing but a vigorous effort could save them.
The commnissioners met, and determined to despatch an
armny of a thousand men, to attack the principal position
of the enemy. Josiah Winslow, governor of Plymolith,
was appointed commander-in-chief, and a solemn fast, to
invoke the divine aid, was proclaimed'throughout NewEngland.  
71. On the 18th of December, the different bodies of
troops formed a junction.at a place in the-couintry of the
Narragansets, about fifteen miles fromr the enemy. The
weather was extremely cold, but the men, from necessity,
passed the night, uncovered, in the fields.- At dawn of
day''they began their march, wading through the deep
snow, and at one o'clock, arrived near the enemy's post,
which was upon a rising ground, in the midst of a swamp.
It.was surrounded by palisades, and on the outside of these
was a fence of brush, a rod in width.
72. Here was fought the most desperate battle recorded
in the early annals of the country. It continued three
hours. The English obtained a decisive victory. One
thousand Indian warriors were killed; three hundred more,
and as many women and children were made prisoners.
But dearly was the victory purchased. Six brave cap-tains, and eighty men, were killed, and one hundred and
fifty were wounded.
73.'From this blow, the confederated Indians never recovered; but they still remnained sufficiently strong to
harass the settlements by continual inroads. In retaliation, the English sent several detachments into their territories, nearly all of which were successful. Captain
Church, of Plymouth, and Captain Dennison, of Connecticut, were conspicuous for their bravery and good fortune.
74. In the midst of these reverses, Philip remained firm
and unshaken. His warriors were cut off; his chief men,
his wife and family, were killed or taken prisoners; and
at these successive misfortunes, he is represented tohave
wept with a bitterness which proved him to possess the
noblest of human virtues and affections; but he disdained
to listen to any offers of peace.. He even shot one of his
men, who proposed submission.  At length, after being
hunted from swamp to swamp, he was himself shot, by
the brother of the Indian he had killed. After his dea4tlh,MASSACHUSETTS.
the remnant of his followers either submitted to the English, or united with distant'tribes.
75. Never was peace more welcome, for never had war
been more distressing. The whole population was in
mourning for relatives slain. - Nearly a thousand hoiuses
had been burned, and goods and cattle of great value, had
been plandered or destroyed. The colonies had contracted
a heavy debt, which, their resources havinga been so much
diminished, they found an almost insupportable burdern.
But, in their deepest distress, they forbore to apply to the
mother country for assistance; and this omission excited
surprise and jealousy. "You act," said a privy counsellor,
"' as though you were independent of our master's crown;
and though poor, yet you are proud."
76. In 1680, New-Hampshire, at the solicitation of John
Mason, to whose ancestor a part of the territory had been
granted, was constituted a separate colony. Massachusetts, apprehending the loss of Maine also, purchased of
the heirs of Gorges, their claim to the soil and jurisdiction,
for twelve hundred and fifty pounds.
77. The disregard of the acts of trade had given great
offence,to the mother country, and the Governors of NewEngland were peremptorily required to enforce them. But
being enacted by a parliament in which the colonies were
not represented, they were regarded as violations of their
rights, and continued to be evaded with ilapunity. Edward Randolph was therefore sent over, commissioned as
inspector of the customs in New-England. He was also
the bearer of a letter from the king, requiring that agents
should be sent to the court of London, fully empowered to
act for the colonies.
78. It was well understood to be the intention of the
king to procure, from the agents, a surrender of the charters, or to annul them by a suit in his courts, that he rmight
himself place officers over the col6nies, who would be subservient to his views. The inhabitants of Massachusetts
felt that to be deprived of their charter, which secured to
them the right of self-government, would be the greatest
of calamities; anid their agents were instructed, in no
emergency, to surrender it. This being known to the king,
a prosecuttion was instituted against the corporation, and,
in 1684, a subservient court decreed that the charter should
be cancelled.
79. All impedirnents to the exercise of the royal will
being thus remnoved, king James established a temporary
4344i         MASSACHUSETTS.
government over the colony, first appointing Joseph Dud
ley, and, in 1686, Sir Edmund Andross, governor. This
latter appointment caused the most gloomy forebodings.
Sir-lX4nund had been governor of New-York, and it was
kowpv ithat his conduct there had been arbitrary and
tyrannical.
80. Having secured a majority in the council, he as.
sumed control over the press, appointing Randolph licenser.
He established new and oppressive regulations concerning
taxes, public worship, marriages, and the settlement of
estates. He, and, by hlis permission, his subordinate officers, extorted enormous fees for their services. He declared that, the charter being cancelled, the old titles to
land were of no validity, and compelled the inhabitants, in
order to avoid suits before judges dependent on his will, to
take out new patents, for which large sums were demanded.
81. The hatred of the people was excited in proportion
to their sufferings. In the beginning of 1689, a rumor
reached Boston, that William, prince of Orange, had invaded England, with.the intention of dethroning the king.
Animnated hy the hope of deliverance, the people rushed
spontaneously to arms, took possession of the fort, seized
Andross, Randolph, and other obnoxious persons, and
placed them in confinement. A council of safety, consisting of their former magistrates, was then organized, to
administer the government until authentic intelligence
should be received fromn England.
82. In a few weeks a ship arrived, bringing the glad
tidings that William and Mary were firmly seated on the
throne. They were immediately proclaimed, in all the
colonies, with unusual rejoicings. The people of Massachusetts applied for the restoration of their old, or the
grant of a new charter. A definite answer was deferred,
hut the council was authlorized to administer the government, according to the provisions of the old charter, until
fuirther directions should be given. Andross, RandQlph,
and' others, were ordered home for trial.
83. In this unsettled state of the country, the French
in -Canada and Nova Scotia, instigated the northern and
eastern Indians to commence hostilities against the Eng.
lish settlements.  Dover and Salmon Falls, in NewHampshire, Casco, in Maine, and Schenectady, in NewYork, were attacked by different parties of French and
Indians, and the most shocking barbarities perpetrated
upon the inlabitants.MASSACHUSETTS.
84. Regarding Canada as the principal source of their
miseries, New-England and New-York formed the bold
project of reducing it to subjection. By great exertioln,
they raised an army, which, under the command of General Winthrop, was sent against Montreal, and equipped a
fleet, which, comrmanded by Sir William Phiipps, was destined to attack Quebec.
85. Both returned unsuccessful, disappointing the --anguine hopes of the people, and burdening them with a debt
whichl they had not the means of discharginlg. T'o pay
off her troops, Massachusetts put in circulation bills of
credit, or paper money, an expedient which was afterwards
often resorted to, and, though it afforded relief at the
moment, produced, in its consequences, extensive and
complicated mischief.
86. In the mean time, a new charter had been granted
to Massachusetts, which added Plymouth, Maine, anld
Nova Scotia, to her territory. The only privilege it allowed to the people was, the choice of representatives.
These were to elect a council, and both bodies were to
constitute the legislative power. It reserved to the king
the righlt of appointing the governor and lieutenant governor. To the governor it gave the power of rejecting laws,
of negativing the choice of counsellors. of appointing all
military and judicial officers, of adjourning and even of
dissolving the assembly at pleasure.  Laws, although
approved by him, might be abrogated by the king, within
three years after their enactment.
87. The king, to render the new charter mnore acceptable, appointed Sir William Phipps, a native of the province,
governor, and in 1692, he arrived at Boston. The new
government went into operation without any opposition
from the inhabitants; and almost the first act of Sir WAilliam Phipps and his council, was the institution of a court
to try the unfortunate victims of popular delusion, accused
of witchcraft, at Salem.
88. The belief in this supposed crime, had been so prevalent in England, that parliament had enacted a law
punishing it with death. Under this law, multitudes had
been tried and executed in that country, and two or three
in Massachusetts, some of whom acknowledged they were
guilty.  Accounts of these trials and confessions, and
particularly of some trials before Sir Matthew Hale, a
judge revered in the colonies, had been published and distributed throughout the ceountry. They were read, in a

time of deep distress and gloomin, by a people naturally
sedate, anrid accusomned to regard with awe the surprising
and unacco.untable inAidents and appearan.es which, in this
new world, were often presented to their contemplation.
89. In Fi'ehruary, 1692, a daughlter and a niece of Mr.
Paris, the minister of Salem, were afflicted with disorders affecting their bodies in the most singular manner.
T'he physicians, unable to account for their contortions,
pronounced them bewitched; and the children, ihearing of
this, declared that an Indian woman, who lived in the
house, was the cause of their torments. Mr. Paris (concurred with the physicians.  Several private fasts were
kept at his house, and the gloom was increased by a
solemn fast throughout the colony.
90. Tlhe Indian womran confessed hlerself guilty. The
children were visited, noticed, and pitied.  This encouraged them to persevere, and other children, either
from sympathy or the desire of similar attentions, exhibited
similar contortions. A distracted old woman, and one
who had been a loing time confined to her bed, were added
to the list of the accused; arid, in the progress of tile
infatuation, women of mature age united withl the children
in their accusations.
91. The accused were multiplied in proportion to the
accusers. Children accused their parents, and parents
their children. A word from those who were supposed
to be afflicted, occasioned the arrest of the devoted victim;  
and so firmly convinced were the magistrates, that the
prince of darkness was in the midst of them, using human
intrumenits to accomplish his purposes, that the slightest
testimony was deemed sufficient to justify a commitment
for trial.
92. The court, especially instituted for this purpose, held
a session in June, and afterwards several others by ad..
journment. Many were tried, and received sentence of
death. A few pleaded guilty. Several were convicted
uponr testimony, which, at other times, would not have
induced suspicion of an ordinary crime, and some upon
testimony retracted after conviction.  Nineteen were
executed, and miany yet remained to be tried.
93. At this stage of the proceedings, the legislature
established, by law, a permanent court, by which the other
was superseded, and: fixed a distant day for its first session at Salem. In the mean time, the accusations multiplied,and additional jails were required to hold the accused.MASSACHUSETTS.
The impostors, hardened by impunity and success, ascended from decrepid old women, Co respectable chtaracters, and at length, in their ravings, named ministers of
the gospel, and evenl the wife of the governor.
94. The comrnmunity were thrown into consternration.
Each felt alarm for himself, his family, and friends. The
shock roused them to reflection. T'rhey considered more
closely the character of the accusers; the nature of the
alleged crinme; the testimony, often contradictory and
never explicit; and more than all thlese, thle high standing
of some who were implicated; and beganto doubt whether
they had not been too credulous and precipitate.
95. At the next term, the grand jury found indictments
against fifty; but, on trial, all were acquitted except three,
andl them the governor reprieved. He also directed that
all who were in prison should he set at liberty. A belief,
however, of the truth of the charges, still ingered among
the people, and prevwu-ted any prosecution of the impostors.
Tlhat all were impostors, cannot be believed. Many must
have acted under the influence of a disordered imriagination,.which the attend(lant circumnstances were well calculated
to produce.
96. Besides establislhing courts of justice, the legislature, at its first session under thie new charter, passed a
law whlich indicates the same independent spirit that afterwards resisted the usutrpations of the British parliament. It provided that no tax should be imposed upon
any of his majesty's subjects, or their estates, in thie province, but by the act and consent of the governor, council,
and representatives of the people, in general court assemDled. It is almost superfluous to say, that this law was
disallowed by the king.
97.- The war with the French and Indians, which began in 1690, was not yet terminated. For seven years
were the frontier settlemnents harassed by the savages;
and the English employed in expeditions against them. A
history of these would consist only of repeated accounts
of Indian cunning and barbarity, and of English enterprise
and fortitude. Peacebetween England and France, which
took place in 1697, was soon followed by peace with the
savages.
98. But in a few years, war again broke out in Europe,
which was the signal for hostilities in America. The first
blow fell upon Deerfield. In February, 1704, it was surpiisnd in the night, about forty persons were killed, and
47AMASSACHUSETTS.
more than one hundred made prisonersf among whom were
Mr. Williams, the minister, and his family. The killed
were scalped, and the prisoners commanded to prepare for
a long march to Canada.
99. On the second day, Mrs. Williams was so exhausted
with fatigue that she could go no farther. Her husband
solicited permission to remain with her; but the retreating savages, according to their customn in such cases, killed
her and compelled him to proceed. Before the termiur
tion of their journey, twenty more became unable to walk,
and were in like manner sacrificed. Those who survived
the journey to Canada were treated by the French with
humanity; and after a captivity of many years, most of
them were redeemed, and returned to their friends.
100. New-York hav ing agreed with the French and the
western Indians to remain neutral, these were enabled to
pour their whGle force upon Massachusetts and NewHampshire, the inhabitants of which, for ten years, endure)
miseries peculiar to an Indian war, and more distressing
than their descendants can well imagine. The enemy
were at all times prowling about the frontier settlements,
watching in concealment for an opportunity to strike a
sudden blow and fly with safety. The women and children retired into the garrisons; the men left their fields uncultivated, or labored with arms at their sdes, and with sentinels at everypoint whence an attack could be apprehended.
101. Yet notwithstanding these precautions, the enemy
were often sucecessful, killing sometimes an individual only,
sometimes a whole family, sometimes a band of laborers,
ten or twelve in number; and so swift were they in their
movements, that but few fell into the hands of the whites.
It was computed, that the sum of one thousand pounds was
expended for every Indian killed or made captiye.
102. In 1707, Massachusetts, New-Hampshire, and
Rhode Island desnatched an armament against Port Royal,
in Nova Scotia, which was then in possession ofthe French.
It returned without accomplishing its object. In 1710,
New-England, assisted by a fleet furnished by the mother
country, succeeded in reducing the place; and its name.
in cormpliment to queen Anne, was changed to Annapolis.
103. The success of this enterprise encouraged the
commander, general Nicholson, to visit England and propose an expedition against Canada. His proposition was
adopted, and in June, 1711, admiral Walker, with a fleet
of fifteen ships of war, and forty transports, bringing an.
48MASSACHUSETTS.
army of veteran troops, arrived at Boston. Taking on
board two additional regiments, he sailed from that port
about the last of July. At the same time, general Nicholson repaired to Albany to take commanaid of the troops that
were to proceed by land.
104. When the fleet had advanced ten leagues up the
river St. Lawrence, the weather became tempestuous an(dfoggy. A difference of opintion arose concerningthe course
to be pulrsued, the English pilots recommending one course,
and the colonial another. The admiral, entertaining, like
all (ther English officers, an opinion of the abilities of the
colonists corresponding with their dependent condition,
adopted the advice of his own pilots. Pursuing the course
they recon-mmended, nine transports were driven, about
mridnight, upon the rocks and dashed to pieces.
105. From every qutarter cries of distress arose, conveying, through the darkness, to those who were yet afloat,
intelligence of the fate of their coni'ades and of their own
danger. The shrieks of the drowning pleaded powerfully
for assistance, but none could be afforded iuntil the morning dawned, when six or seven hundred, found floatingr on
the.scattered wrecks, were rescued frto,m death, more than
a thousalnd havintg sunk. to, rise no more. Not a single
Amnerican was lost.

determined to return to England, whe~e he arrived in the
morth~ of October.  Thither misfbrtlune attended him.
On the fifteenth,' his ship blew up and( ftbur hundred seamen perished. The New.-England troops retutrned to their
homes, and Nicholson, having learned the fateof the fleet,
led-back his troops to Albany.. The next year the colonies
tfound no repose. In 1713, France- and England made
peace at LJtre,ht, and, in the same year, peace was con,
cluded( with the Indians.
107. Such was the destrluction of lives in this war, that
the ipopulation of N.w-Englandj was sensibly retarded.
-fHer expenses were also enormous. Although the annual
taxes paid by the inhabitants, were greater than in -anly
other portion of the British empire, yet the colonies most
exposed, were burdened, at the close of the war, with a
heavy debt, in the shape of bills of credit, or: paper money,
which impeded their prosperity, perplexing individuals and
the government in all their transactions;'108. In 1716, Sanueel Shute, a- colonel in thearmy of

49PREFACE.
THE following work was begun many years since:
the appearance, soon after, of several books, on a plan
nearly similar, and the want of sufficient leisure, induced
the Author to relinquish his design. Perceiving, from
the subsequent offer of a premiuma for the best written
work of the kind, that another was wanted, he resumed
and completed his undertaking.:
It was his purpose to present a correct and interesting
narrative of all the important events in the history of his
country: to exhibit, in a strong light, the principles of
political and religious freedom which our forefathers professed, and for which they fought and conquered; to record
the numerous examples of fortitude, courage, and patriotism, which have rendered them illustrious; and to produce,
not so much by moral reflections, as by thle tenor of the
narrative, virtuous and patriotic impressions upon the mind
of the reader. It was his aim to render the book worthy
to be read, not only in the academies and schoos of his
country, but by that very numerous portion of his fellow
citizens, who have seldom the zpportunity to peruse more
voluminous productions; and by those who might wish to
review their studies, and fix in thieir memory the succession of events: and it was also his aim to exhibit a style
whicl. should be correct and pure; should be free from
ambitious ornament, and from those faults with which the
writers of this country have been too justly charged. He
by no means supposes that lie has accomplished all he
aimed at.
It was thought indispensible that a history, intended to
be accessible to all, should contain some account of thl

it, in December, 1722. Upon his arrival in England, he
exhibited charges against the house, of having miade
various encroachments upon the king's perogative, which
the agents of the province were instructed to answer and
repel..
115. He remained in England until 1728, when he
resigned his office, and William Burnet, then governor of
New-York, was appointed his successor.  In his first
speech, he informed the house that he had received positive instructions from the king to insist on a permanent
salary. The representatives, generous of their mnoney but
tenacious of their rights, appropriated three hundred pounds
for the expenses of his journey, and fourteen hundred
ounds towards his support, not specifying for what time.
rhe first sum he accepted; but absolutely declined receiving any compensation for his services, except in the
mode of a fixed sala-y.
116. The delegates were equally decided; and having
transacted all their necessary business, requested the governor, by message, to adjourn theni. He replied, that he
could not comply with their request, as, if he did, he
should put it outt of their power to pay inmmediate regard
to the king's instructions. A few days afterwards, the
request was again made and again denied.
117. Messages, containing arguments and replies, were
often interchanged by the parties. After two months had
been consumed in the controversy, the governor, imagining the members were influenced by the citizens of Boston, transferred the general court to Salem. They were
detained there two months; were then allowed to return
to their homnes; were again assembled after a short
recess; and having sat seventeen days, were again adjourned without exhibiting any symptoms of compliance.118. A new assembly was elected, and several sessions
in the summer of 1729, displaying the samte spirit as the
former. In the mean time, information was transmitted
from England, that the king approved the conduct of the
governor, and condemned that of the house. Still the
members continued inflexible. In August, they were
removed to Cambridge, which served to exasperate rather
than to convince them. Here, however, the controversy
was suspended, for a time, by the death of the governor, which was supposed to have been hastened by
his unsuccessful contest with the house of representa
tivee. -  MASSACII.U.SETTS.
119. His successor was Mr. Belcher, then agent ia
England.  As he belonged to the poplllar party, hiL
appointment gave rise to the expectation, that the instruction, to obtain a permanent salary, was withdrawn. But
from his first speech it appeared, that it was iot only
unrescinded, but enforced by a threat of punishment in
case of refusal.
120.. The house, unintimidated by the threat, refused.
The governor, during the: two first years of his administration, made several attempts to induce them to comply.
All failing, he endeavored to obtain a relaxation of his
instructions. Permission was at length granted that he
might receive a particular sum, which was* voted,.:and a
similar permnission was afterwards annually given.. Thus
ended a contest which prepared the people..of Massachusetts to;embark in another in which more important. rights
were to be defeinded.
121. These turbulent times.ere,succeeded by a calm
which continued several years; during which, however,
the enemies. of governor Belchex, by incessant misrepresentation, deprived him of the favor of the ministry in
England. In 1740, he was. removed from office, and Mr.
WVilliam Shirley appointed in his place.
122. In 1744, war again broke out between England and
France, aWind the colonies were involved in its calamities.
Their commerce and fisheries suffere(d great injury from
privateers, fitted out at Louisburg, a French port, on cape
Breton. Its situation gave it such importance, that nearly
six millions of dollars had been expended on its fobrtifications.. Mr. Vaughan, of New-Hampshire, who had often
visited that place as a trader, conceived the project of an
expedition against it. He communicated it to governor
Shirley, and, being ardent and enthusiastic, convinced him
that the enterprise was practicable, and inspired him with
his own enthusiasm.
123. Having exacted of the general court an oath of
secrecy, the governor, in January, 1745, communicated to
them the project. Many heard it with amazement. So
strong was the place, and so weak comparatively were the
colonies, that the thought of attacking it seemed rash and
presumptuous. From respect to hini, however, his proposal was referred to a committee; they reported against
it, the house accepted the report, and the mrnember~ dismissed from their minds all thoughts of the expeditioii.
124. During the secret delibberations the people watchedwith anxiety to ascertain their object. The disclosutre
was made by an honest member, who incautiously, in hie
family devotions, prayed for the divine blessing on the
attempt, should it be made. The people were instantly
struck with the advantage of possessing the place. When
the decision was made known, a petition, signed by a large
number of merchants, was presented to the general court,
praying them to-comply with the governor's proposal. The
subject was again discussed, and a vote in favor of the
expedition was passed by a majority of one.
125. The question was now decided, and all who were
before averse to the enterprise, united heartily with its
supporters to carry it into execution. The other NewEngland colonies were solicited, and agreed to furnish
assistance; and a b(oat was despatched to commodore
Warren, in the West Indies, to invite his co-operation.
Colonel Pepperell was appointed commander-in-chief, and
Roger Woleott, of Connecticut, second in command.
126. In two months, an armiy of more than four thousand
men was enlisted, clothed, victualled, and equipped for
service, in the four New-England colonies, which did not
then contain four hundred thousand inhabitants. On the
23d of March, the despatch boat returned from the W,st
Indies, with advice that commodore Warren declined furni3hing aid. This intelligence was kept secret. The
troops of Massachusetts embarked, as though nothing discouraging had happened, and about the middle of April,
they, as well as those sent hy Connecticut and NewHalampshire, arrived safe at Canso.
127. Commodore:Warren had but just despatched his
answer, when he received orders to repair to Boston with
such ships as could be spared, and concert measures with
governor Shirley for his majesty's service in North America. He sailed instantly, but learning, in his course, that
the transports lihad left Boston for Canso, he steered
directly for that place, where he arrived on the 23d of
Apirl. H-fe added much to their naval strength, and much
to that confidence, which, by promising, ensures victory.
128. Several vessels of war, which had been sent to
cruise before Louisburg, had captured a number of French
ships, and prevented any intelligence of the expedition
from reaching the enemy. These vessels were daily in
sight of the place, but were supposed to be privateers. and
caused no alarm. T'rhe appearance-of the fleet, on the.O0th
of April, gave the French the first intimnation of their da.,ger

129. The troops immediately landed, and the next day
a detachment of four hundred, inarching round the hills,
approached within a mile of the grand battery, setting fire
to all the houses and stores on the way. Many of these
contained pitch and tar, which produced a thick smoke,
that completely enveloped the invaders. T'he fears of the
French were increased by their uncertainty. They imagined the whole army was coming upon them, and, throwing their powder into a well, deserted the battery, of which
the New-England troops took possession without loss.
130. This was uncommon good fortune; but the most
difficult labors of the siege remained to be performed.
The cannon were to be drawn -nearly two miles, over a
deep morasis, in plain view, and within gun-shot, of the
enemy's principal fortifications. For fourteen nights, the
troops, with straps over their shoulders, and sinking to
their knees in mud, were employed in this service.
131. The approaches were then begun in the mode which
seemed most proper to the shrewd understandings of untaught militia. Those officers, who were slkilled in the art
of war, talked of zigzags and epaulements; but the troops
made themselves merry with the terms, and proceeded in
their own way. By the 20th of May, they had erected
five batteries, one of which mounted five forty-two poulders, and did greatexecution.
132. Meanwhile the fleet, cruising in the harbor, had
Deen equally successful. It captured a French ship of
sixty-four guns, loaded with stores for the garrison, to
whom the loss was as distressing, as to the besiegers the
capture was fortunate. English ships of war, were, besides, continually arriving, and added such strength to the
fleet that a combined attack upon the town was resolved
upon. The enemy, discovering this design, deemed it
unwise to abide the hazard of an assault.  On the 15th
of June, the French commander proposed a cessation of
hostilities, and, on the 17th capitulated.
133. Intelliaence of this event, flying swiftly through
the colonies, diffused great and universal j6y. And well
might the citizens of New-England be elated with the
glad tidings. Without even a suggestion from the mothei
country, they had projected, and, with but little assistance,
had achieved, an enterprise of vast importance to her and
to them. Their commerce and fisheries were now secure,
and their maritime cities relieved from all fear of attack
from that quarter.N EW-HAMPSH[lRa
134. Franoe~ fired with resentment at her loss, made
extraordinary exertions to retrieve it, and to inflict chastisement on New-England, The next summer, she despatched to the Amnerican coast a powerful fleetf carrying a
large number of soldiers. The news of its approach spread
telror throughout New-England; but an uncommon suce
cession of disasters, which the pious of that time attributed to the special interposition of Providence, deprived it
of all power to inflict injury  Atter remaining a short tirne
on the coast, it returned to' Prance, having lost two admirals, both of whom, it was supposed, putt an end to their
lives through chagrin; hevirig also, by tempests, been
reduced to one half its force, and effected nothing.
135. In 1748, peace was concluded, each party restoring
all its prisoners and conquests ~ a striking, but not uncommon, illustration of the.folly of war. Loaislburg though
conquered by the colonies, was exchanged, by Great
Britain, for territories which she had lost in Europe.
New-England murmured at this injustice; but what avail
the murmurs of the weak.
136. Fromrn this period to the commencement of the next
Frenchi war, but few important events occurred in MAassa.,
chusetts. T'he bills of credit,which the colony had issued
to defray its enormous expenditure, were redeemed by the
government, at their depreciated value. This example
was followed, thoutgh tardily, by the other governments.
At the time of their redemption, they were worth no more,
in some colonies, than one tenth, and in others, one twentieth, of the sum bfor which they had been issuted.
CHAPTER III.
NEW-HAMPSHIRE.
WITH the h'story of Massachusetts, the parent of the
New-Englan colonties, that of New-Hampshire has been
necessarily otended. A brief relation of some detached
events, v'niich occurred in the latter colony, will now be
given.
2..', hn Mason, Ferdinand Gorges, and others, having
obt'nted, of the Plymouth or New.England Company,
grvutts of several tracts of land, lying north of Massachusetts, sent from England, in 1623, a, fow persons to begin

a settlement. Part landed, and, for a short time, remained
at Little Harbor, on the vest side of Piscataqua river, and
near its mouth. Here the first house was built, which
was called Mason Hall.   The remainder, proceeding
higher up the river, settled at Cocheco, afterwards called
Dover.
3. Fishing and trade being the principal objects of these
emigrants, their settlements increased slowly. In 1629,
the territory situated between Merrimac and Piscataqua
rivers, and extending sixty miles from the sea, was granted
to Mason alone, and then first:called New-I1ampshire.
In 1631, the first house was built at Portsmouth. In 1638,
the Reverend John WheeIwright, who, in 16l29, but previous to the date of -Mason's patent, had purchased the
land of the Indians, laid the foundation of Exeter. Tihe
next year, thirty-five persons, residing in that town,
comribined and established civil government.  Withini a
year or two afterwards, the inhabitants of Dover and
Portsmouth followed their example, eachl town remaining
distinct and independent.
4. In 1641, these little republics, distrusting their ability
to protect themselves, formed a coalition with Massachusetts, and long remained a part of that colo'ny. The civil
wars in England diverted the attention of Mason from his
grant, and those whlo migrated to the country purchased
of 5Vheelwright, the lands which they occupied. In the
war with Philip, the settlements onI Piscataqua and Oyster
rivers, were attacked by the Indians, and suffered severely.
5. In 1675, Robert Mason, grandsoni and heir of John
Mason, applied to the king to obtain possession of the territory and rights which had been granted to his ancestor.
Notice of this application was given to Massachusetts,
and the parties were heard before the king in council.
In 1679, a decree was passed, that New-Hampshire sliould
be constituted a separate province, to`be ruled by a president and council, who were to be appointed by the king,
and a house of representatives to be chosen by the people.
No decision was made affecting the titles- to land.
6. The first assembly, consisting of eleven members,
met, in 1680, at Portsmouth. At this session, a code of
laws was adopted, of which the first, in a style worthy of
freemen, declared, "that no act, imposition, law, or ordinance, should be imposed upon the inhabitants-"of the
province, but such as should be made by the assembly,
and approved by the president and council."  This was
56NEW*-TIAMPSHIRE.
twelve years previous to the enactment of a similar law in
Massachusetts.
7. In the same year, Mason, Who had been appointed a
member of the council, arrived in the colony. He assumed
thetitle of lord proprietor, claimed the'soil as his property,
and threatened to prosecute all who would not take from
him leases of the lands they occupied. His pretensions
W'ere resisted by most of the inhabitants, who claimed the
fee-simple of the soil by a more righteous, if not more
legal title.    -
8. The peace of the colony was long distuibed by these
conflicting claims. At the head of those who contended
with Mason, stood major Waldron, of Dover. Against
him, and many others, suits were instituted. Nodefence
was made, judgments were obtained, but so general was
the hostility to Mason, that he never dared to enforce them.
9. Over Massachusetts and New-Hampshire, the same
governor usually presided.: After Andross was deposed,
the inhabitants of the latter colony desired to be incorpo
rated with their former brethren. Their request was
opposed by Samulel Allen, who had purchased Mason's
title, and was refused. Allen was made governor of the
colony, and, by his influence, John Usher, his son-in-law,
was appointed lieutenant governor. UJnder his administration, the disputes, occasioned by adverseclaims to land,
continued to rage with increased violence. Other suitP
were instituted, and judgments obtained; but the sherifl
was forcibly resisted, by a powerful combination, wheneve3
he attempted to put the plaintiff in possession.
10. From Indian wars this colony suffered more than
any of her sisters. The surprise of Dover, in 1689, was
attended by circumstances of the most shocking barbarity.
That the natives had beencruelly injured by majorWaldron,
the principal citizen, may account for, if not extenuate,
-their ferocity in obtaining revenge.
11. Having determined upon their plan of attack, they
employed more than their usual art, to lull the suspicions
of the inhabitants. So civil and respectful was theii
behavior, that they often obtained permission to sleep in
the fortified houses in the town. On the evening of the
fatal night, they assembled in the neighborhood, and sent
their women to apply for lodgings, at the houses devoted
to destruction; who were not only admitted, but were
shown how'they could open the doors should they have
occasion to go out in the night.'57NEW-HAMPSHIRLE.
192. When all was quiet, the doors were opened and the
signal giveii. The Indians rushed into Waldron"s house,
and hastened to his apartment. Awakened by the -noise,
he seized his sword and drove them back, but when
returning for his other arms, was stunned with a hatchet,
and fell. They then dragged him into his hall, seated
him in an elbow chair, upon a long tables anid insultingly
asked him, "who shall judge Indians now " After feasting
upon provisions, which they compelled the rest of the
family to procure, each one, with his knife, cut gashes
across his breast, saying, " I cross out my account." When,
weakened with the loss of blood, he was about to fall from
the table, his own sword was held under him, which put
an end to his misery.
13. At other houses, similar acts of cruelty were perpetrated. In the whole, twenty-three persons were killed,
twenty-nine carried prisoners to Canada, and mostly sold
to the French. Rememberin- kindness as well as injury,
they spared one woman, who, thirteen years before, had
conferred a favor on one of the party. Many houses were
burned, much property was plundered, and so expeditious
were the Indians, that they had fled beyond reach before
the neighboring people could be collected.  
14. The war thus commenced was prosecuted with great
vigor. The French, by giviffg premiums for scalps, and
by purchasing the English prisoners, animated the Indians
to exert all their activity and address, and the frontier
inhabitants endured the most aggravated sufferings. The
settlements on Ovqter river were again surprised; twenty
houses were burned, and nearly one hundred persons were
killed or made prisoners. Other towns were attacked,
many persons slain, and many carried into captivity. The
peace of Ryswick, in 1697, closed the distressing scene.
In 1703, another war began, which continued ten years.
15. In 1719, above one hundred families, mostly Presoyterians, emigrated from the north of Ireland, and settled
the town of Londonderry.  They introduced the foot
spinning-wheel, the manufacture of linen, and the culture
of potatoes. They were industrious, hardy, and useful
citizens.
16. From 1722, to 1726, the inhabitants again suffered
the afflictions of an Indian war. Following the example
of the French, the government offered premiums forscalps,
which induced several volunteer companies to undertake
expeditions against the enemy. One of these, commanded

by captain Lovewell, was greatly distinguished, at first by
its successes, and afterwards by its misfortunes.
17. Long after the transfer from Mason to Allen, some
defect in the conveyance was discovered, which rendered
it void. In 1746, John Tufton Mason, a descendant of
the original grantee, claimning the lands possessed by his
ancestors, conveyed them, for fifteenll hundred pounds, to
twelve persons, subsequently called the Masonian proprie,
tors. They, to silence opposition, voluntarily relinquished
their claim to the lands already occupied by otliers,
18. They also granted townships on the most liberal
terms. Reserving certain portions of the land for themselves, for the first settled ministers, and for schools, they
required merely that the grantees should, within a limnited
time, erect mills and meeting houses, clear out roads, and
settle ministers of the gospel. In process of time, nearly
all the Masonian lands, being about one fourth of the whole,
were, in this minanner, granted; and contention and lawsuits
ceased to disturb the repose, and to impede the prosperity
of the colony.CHAPTER IV.
CONNECTICUT.
IN 1631, viscount Say and Seal, lord Brook, and others,
obtained from the Plymouth Company, in England, a grant
of the territory which now constitutes the state of Connecticut; and so little was then known of the geography
of the new world, that the grant was made to extend, in
longitude, from the Atlantic Ocean to the South Sea. In
the same year, the Indians, living on Connecticut river,
having invited the colony of Plymouth to make a settlement
on their lands, governor Winslow, and others, visited the
country, and selected a place near the mouth of the little
river in Windsor, for the erection of a trading house.
2. The Dutch at New-York, apprized of this project of
the English, and determined to anticipate them, immediately despatched a party, who erected a fort-at Hartford.
In September, 1633, a company from Plymouth, having
prepared the frame of a house, put it on board a vessel,
and, passing the fort, conveyed it to the place previously
selected. In October, they raised, ccvered, and fortified

different states of the union; in order that many preju
dices, the offspring of ignorance, might be removed; and
that the injurious effects, which must flow from an ae
quaintance with the history of a single state only, might
be avoided. It was the correct remark of an able writer,
that the history of colonies generally affords but two interesting eras, that of their settlement, and that of their
independence. To both of these the author has more
particularly directed his attention.
Let those who imagine that no book can do good that
is not a great book, consider that every American should
be acquainted with the history of his country, and that a
voluminous history would not be read by one twentieth
part of the population; that, on most minds, the same or
even stronger impressions would'be made by a work well
written on the plan of this, than by a minute, and of
course often tedious, detail of every event; that the perusal of such a work, in early life, must excite rather than
gratify curiosity; that much, very much good would be
done, should a knowledge of the important events be
communicated, and correct impressions be given, to those
who would otherwise remain entirely ignorant: and that,:n fact, this book contains more than many an octavo ot
high pri,e.
But while it is important that no American citizen
should be ignorant of the principal events in the history
of his country, it is the indispensible duty of all, who
can enjoy the opportunity, to read and to study the larger
and more particular histories which have been published.
Tnere is little danger that this small and favored class
will neglect this duty. The danger is greater, that much
the most numerous portion of the population-that portion in whose hands are the destinies of the republic- -
would read nothing on the subject should expensive works
only be published.- CONNECTICUT.
it with palisades. The Dutch, considering thenm intruders,
sent, the next year, a party of seventy men to drive them
from the country, but finding them strongly posted,. they
relinquished the design.
* 3. In the autumn of 1635, many ofthe inhabitants of
Darchestcr and Watertown, in Mlassachusetts, having
heard of the fertile meadows on Connecticut river, removed thither, and began settlements at Weathersfield
and Windsor. During the next Winter, their sufferings
from famine were extreme. So destitute were they of
povisions, that many, in dread of starvation, returned, in
December, to Massachusetts. In their journey through
the dreary wilderness, at this inclement season, they encountered indescribable hardships.
4. In the same autumn, Mr. Winthrop arrived from
England, with instructions from the patentees to erect a
fort at the mouth of the river, and make the requisite
preparation for planting a colony. The fort was but just
completed when a party, sent, for the same purpose, by
the Dutch, at New-York, arrived in a vessel, but were
not permitted to land.
5. The next spring, those who had been compelled by
famine to revisit Massachusetts, returned to Connecticut.
In June, the Reverend Mr. Hooker, of Cambridge, and
about one hundred men, women, and children, belonging
to his congregation, travelling through the wilderness,
laid the foundation of tHartford. They were nearly two
weeks on their journey;. they drove their cattle with them.
and subsisted, by the way, upon the milk of their cows.
6. In 1637, all the settlements in New England were
involved in hostilities with the Pequods, a tribe of Indians
inhabiting New London and the country around it. Some
account of this war has been given in the history of Massachusetts.  Previous to any expedition against them,
they had killed many of the emigrants to Connecticut,
had captured others, and tortured them to death. In the
short war which followed, their surviving brethren, for
bravery in battle and fortitude in suffering, were not surpassed by any portion of the English troops.
7. At first, the emigrants acknowledged the authority
of Massachusetts. In January, 1639, the freemen, havil:g
convened at Hartfbrd, adopted a constitution.for themselves. They ordained that two general courts, or assemblies, should be held annually, one in April, the other in
September; that at the court held. in April, styled thee.otu

of election, the freemen should choose a governor, six
magistrates, and all the public officers:; that to the other,
the several towns should send deputies, who, in conjunction with the governor and magistrates, were authorized
to enact laws, and perform all necessary public services.
No generai court could be adjourned or dissolved, without
the consent of a major part of the members.  
8. In the same year, George Fenwick, one of the
patentees, came over with his family, and settled at the
mouth of the river.'In honor of lord Say and Seal, and
lord Brook, he called the place Saybrook.  Others afterwards joined him; and for several years, they were governed by their own mnagistrates and laws. In 1644, Mr.
Fenwick, for seven thousand dollars, assigned to the
general court of Connecticut, the fort at - Saybrook, and
all the rights conferred by the patent from the Plymnouth
companx in England. Thissettlement then became a part
of the colony.' The claim of Plymrnouth colony, founded
upon their having first made an establishment at Windsor,
had been previously purchased.
9. In the mean time, another colony had been planted
within the limits of the Connecticut patent. In June, 1637,
two large ships arrived at Boston, from England, having
on board Mr. Davenport, Mr. Eaton, and many others,
whom pious motives had impelled to emigrate to NewEngland.' Being highly respectable, and some of them
possessing great wealth, the general court of Massachusetts, desirous of detaining them in the colony, offered
them any place they might select for a plantation.
10. Wishing, however, to institute a civil and religious
community, conforming in all things to their peculiar
principles, they removed, the next year, to Quinnipac,
which they ealled New Haven. Soon after their arrival,
at the close of a day of tasting and prayer, they subscribed
wiat they termned a planitation covenant, solemnly binding
themselves," until otherwise ordered, to be governed in
all things, of a civil as well as religious concern, by the
rules which the scripture held forth to them." They purchased of the natives, large tracts of land; and laid out
their towns in squares, designing it for a great and elegant
city.
11. In 1639, all the free planters, assembled in a large
barn, proceeded to lay the foundation of their- civil and
religious polity. -They resolved: that none but church

elected to office; that all the freemen should annually
assemble and elect the officers of the colony; and that
the word of God should be the only rule for ordering the
affairs of the commonwealth. Such was the original constitution of New-Haven; but as the population increased,
and new towns were settled, different regulations were
adopted, and the institutions and laws became gradually
assimilated to those of Connecticut.
12. With the Dutch at New-York, both colonies had
constant and vexatious disputes. The former claimed all
the territory as far east as Connecticut river; the latter
complained that the Dutch often plundered their property;
th,at they sold guns and amnmunition to tne Indians, and
even encouraged them to make war upon the English.
The fear of attack from that quarter, was one of the reasons which,in 1643, induced the colonies of New-Englalnd
to form a confederation for their mutual defence
13. In 1650, a treaty of amity and partition was conceludedl at Hartford, between the English and Dutch, the
latter relinquishing their claim to the territory of Connecticut, except the lands which they actually occupied.
Soon after, England and Holland were involved in war
with each other, but their colonies in America agreed to
remain at peace. Notwithstanding this agreement, the
Dutch governor was detected in concerting with the In,
dians a plot for the total extirpation of the English.
14. Connecticut and New-Haven were alarmed; a
meeting of the commissioners of the united colonies, was
called, and evidence of the plot laid before them. A
majority was in favor of war; but the colony of Massachusetts, being remote from the danger, was averse to it.
As she was much stronger than either of the others, it
was, at the suggestion of her deputies, resolved, that
agents should first be sent to demnand of the Dutch governor an explanation of his conduct.
15. Thie agents obtained no satisfactory explanation.
On their return, another meeting of the commissioners
was held at Boston, additional testimony was laid before
them, and several ministers of Massachusetts wereinvited
to assist at their deliberations, a practice Inot unusual at
that period.
16. The opinion of these ministers being requested,
they obsefved, "that the proofs of the execrable plot,
tending to the destruction of the dear saints of God, were
at sucl weight as to induce them to) believe the reality

es
of it; yet they were not so fully conclusive as to bear up
their hearts with the fulness of persuasion which was
meet in commending the case to God in prayer, and to
the people in exhortations; and that it would be safest for
the colonies to forbear the use of the sword."  
17. But all the commissioners, except one, were of
opinion that recent aggressions justified, and self preservation dictated, an appeal to the sword. They were about
to declare war, when the general court of Massachusetts
in direct violation of one of the articles of the confedera.
tion, resolved, "that no determination of the commission
ers, though all should agree, should bind the colony tc
engage in lostilities."
18. At this declaration, Connecticut and New-Haven
felt alarmed and indignant. They considered the other
colonies too weak, without the assistance of Massachusetts, to contend with the Dutch and their Indian allies.
They argued, entreated, and remonstrated, but she continued inflexible. They then represented their danger to
Cromwell, and imrplored his assistance. He, with his
usual promptitude, sent a fleet for thleir protection, and for
the conilrest of their enemies but peace in Europe, intelli.
gence of which reached New-iEngland soon after the arrival
of thefleet, saved the Dutch from subjugation, and relieved
the colonies from the dread of massacre.
19. After Charles II was restored to the throne, Connecticut applied to him for a royal Charter. A trifling
eircumstaace induced him, forgetting all his arbitrary
maxims, to comply with her wishes:to their utmost extent.
Her agent, Mr. Winthrop, having an extraordinary ring,
which -had been given to his grandfather by Charles I,
presented it to his son. He immediately granted a charter, more liberal in its provisions than any that had yet
been granted, and confirming, in every particular, the
constitution which the people had themselves adopted.
20. This charter comprehended New.-Haven; but, for
several years, the people of that colony utterly refused to
consent to the union, In this opposition to the commands
of the king, and the remonstrances of Connecticut, they
persevered until 1665, when the apprehension of the
appointment of a general governor, and of their being
united with some other colony, having a charter less favorable to liberty, impelled them, though reluctantly, to yield.

hlowever, in full proportion to her strength, was always
freely afforded; and no troops su-rpassed her v,olunteers in
bravery and enterprise.  A large: nunber, and many of
them officers, were killed at the assault upon the fort at
Narraganset.                  -  
22. In 1686, king James II, desirous of annulling, not
only the charters which had been granted to his English
cities, but those also which had been granted-to his Ameri
can colonies, summoned the governor of Connecticut to
appear. and show cause why her charter should not be
declared void. And Sir Edmund Andross, who had been
appointed governor of New-England, advised the c6lony,
as the course best calculated to ensure the good will of
his majesty, to resign it, voluntarily inIIto his hands,.he
having been instructed to receive it. But the people
estimated too highly the priyileges it conferred to surrender
it until necessity compelled them..
23. Sir Edmund, therefore, repaired, with a body of
troops, to Hartford, when the assembly were in session.
and demanded of them the charter. They hesitated and
debated until evening. It was then produced and laid upon
the table, a large number of people being present. Suddenly,the candles were extinguished. With counterfeited
haste, they were again relighted; but the charter coul(i no
where be found. In the da'k, it had. been privately carried
off, by a captain Wadsworth, and concealed in a hollow
tree. Sir Edmund, however, assumed the governmnent of
the colony, and ruled with the same absolute sway, thou'gh
not with the same oppressive tyranny, as in Massachusetts.
24. When James was driven from his tlhronie and kingdom, and his governor deposed, Connecticut resumed her
former government.  The assembly voted a flattering
address to king William. The suit, instituted for the
purpose of annulling her charter, was abandoned; anid her
inhabitants, wliile enjoying greater privileges than any of
their brethren, had reason to congratulate themselves upon
their address and good fortune in preserving them.
25. But, not long afterwards, they were again called
upon to defend these privileges from eneroachment. In
1692, colonel Fletcher was appointed governor of NewYork, and was authorized, by his commission, to take
comnmand of the militia of Connecticut. This power
having been given, by the charter, to the governor of the
colony, he: determined not to relinquish it, and in:this
determination was supported by the people.CONNEICTiCUT,
1g1. The next year1 when the general court were it
session, colonel Fletcher repaired to Hartford, and required
that the militia of the colony shoukld be placed under his
commandfl. This was resolutely refused. He then oTrdered
the trainbands of the city to be assembled. This being
done, he appeared before them, and directed his aid to read
to them his commission and instructions from the king.
27. Captain Wadsworth, the senior officer of the militia
present, instantly ordered the drums to beat, and such was
the noise, that nothing else could be heard, Colonel
Fletcher commanded silence; and again his aid began to
read. "Drumf drum, I say," exclaimed Wadsworth, and
a command so acceptable to the players, was obeyed with
spirit. Once more the colonel commanded silence, and a
p, use ensued. " Drum, drum, I say," cried the captain,
and turning to governor Fletcher, addressed him, with
energy in his voice and meaning in his looks, " If I am
interrupted again, I will make the sun shine through you
in a moment."
V8. Deeming it unwise to contend with such a spirit,
colonel F'letcher desisted, left Hartford the next night,
and returned to New-York.   A representation of the
opposinig claims being made to the king, he decided that
the governor of Connecticut should have the command of
the militia; but in time of war, a certain number should
be placed under the orders of Fletcher.
29. In 1700, Yale college was fotnded. It owes its
existence to the beneficence' and public spirit of the clergy.
It was first established at Saybrook; and, in 1702, the
first degrees were there conferred.  Elihu Yale made
several donatiols to the institItion, and from him it derives
the name it bears. A succession of able instructers has
raised it to the second rank among the literary institutions
of thie country.
30. In 1708, an act was passed by the legislature,
lequliring the ministers and delegates of church.es to meet
and forum an ecclesiastical eonstitution for the colony. A
meeting was in consequence held at Saybrook, the result
of which was the celebrated Saybrook platform. At the
subsequent session of the legislature, it was enacted that
all thle chutrches, united accordinrg to this platform, should
be ovwmed as established by law- allowing, however, to
other churches, the right of exereising worship and discipline in their own way, according to their consciences.
31. In thlle several abortivceatemts to reduce the French'3  settlements in Canada, and in the expeditionl against Lo, isburg, Connecticut fuirnished her full quota of troops, and
bore her proportion of the expenses. Of these, a history
is elsewhere given. After the death of Philip, mpost of the
Indians abanidoned her territory, and seldom returned to
molest the inhabitants; who, living in the enjoyment of
all the privileges they desired, felt no inducement, and
were afforded no opportunity, to performn such actions as
enliven the pages of history.
CHAPTER V.
RHODE ISLAND.
ROGER WILLIAMS, who was banishled fiom Massachusetts, for avow;ng the doctrine, that the civil magistrate is
bound to grant equal protectioi to every denoinination of
Christians, a doctrine too liberal for the age in whtich lhe
lived, repaired to Seeconk, where he procured a grant of
lanrd fromn the Indians. Being informed, by the governor
of Plymouthl, that the land was within the limits of that
colony, he proceeded to Mooshausic, where, in 1636, with
those friends who followed him, hle began a plantation.
2. He purchased the land of the Indians, and, inr grateful
acknowledgment ot the kindness of heaven, he called the
place Providence. Acting in conformity with the wise
and liberal principle, for avowing and maintaining which,
he had suffered banishment, he allowed entire freedom of
conscience to all'who came within his borders. And to
him must be given the glory of having first set a practical
example of,the equal toleration of all religious sects in the
same political community.
3. His benevolehece was not confined to his civilized
brethren. He labored to enlighten, improve, and conciliate
the savages. He learned their language, travelled amonio
them, ani gained the entire confidence bf their chiefs.
He had often the- happiness, by his influence over them,
of saving from injury the colony that had proclaimed him
an outlaw, and driven him into the wilderness.
4. In 1638, William Coddington, and seventeen others,
being persecuted fortheir religious tenets in Massachusetts,
follox~ed Williams to Providence. By his -advice, they
pirchased of the Indians the island of Aquetnec, now
66
IRHODE ISLAND.called Rhode Island, and removed thither. Coddington
was chosen their judge, or chief magistrate. The fertility
of the soil, and the toleration of all christian sects, attracted
numerous emigrants from the adjacent settlements.
5. When the New-Enigland colonies, in 1643, formed
their memorable confederacy, Rhode Island applied to be
admitted a member. Plymouth objected; asserting that
the settlements were within her boundaries. The commissioners decided that Rhode Island might enjoy all the
advanitages of thee confederacy, if she would submit to the
iurisdiction of Plymouth. She declined, proudly preferring
independence to all the bene'ffts of dependent union.
6. In 1644, Williams, having been sent to England as
agenrt for both settlements, obtained of the Plymouth
Company, a patent for the territory, and permission for the
inhabitants to institute a government for themselves. In
1647, delegates chosen by the freemnen, held a general
assembly at Portsmouth, organized a government, and
established a code of laws. The executive power'was
confid(led to a president andl four assistants.
7. Upon the application of the inhabitants, the kiLng, in
1663, granted a charter to Rhode Island and Providence
Plantations. The supreme, or legislative power, was to
be exercised by an assembly, which was to conisist of the
governor, of tenr assistants, and of representatives from
the several towns, all to be chosen by the freemen. This
assembly granted to all christian sects, except Roman
Catholics, the right of voting. In 1665, they authorized,
by law, the seizure of the estates of Quakers, who refused
to assist in defending the colony; but this law, being generally condemned by the people, was never executed.
8. When Andross was made governior over New-England, he dissolved the charter government of Rhode Island,
and ruled the colony, with the assistance of a council
appoint.ed by himself. After he was imprisoned, at Boston,
the freemen met at Newport, and voted to resume their
charter. All the officers who, three years before, had been
displaced, were restored.
9. Tile benevolence, justice, and pacific policy of Williams, secured to the colony an almost total exemption
from Indian hostility. In 1730, the number of inhabitants
was 18,000; in 1761, it was 40,000. Brown University
was founded, at Warren, in 1764; and was removed, a few
years after, to Providence. Its founder was Nicholas
rown, whogave to the institution five thousand dollars

6GCHAPTER VI.
NEW-YORK.
Iy 1609, Henry lHudson, an Englishman, but sailing in
the service ofthe I)Dutch East India Company, discovered
Long Island, the harbor of New-York. and the river to
which his name has been given. In 1613, several I)utehl
mnerchants, to whom the repbll)lic of Holland had granted
the exctlusive rigoht of trading to tiis part of America,
erected a fort near Albany, which they namned fort Orange,
and'a few trading holIses on the island of New-York, then
called, by the Indians, Manhattan.
2. In the same wear, captain Argal, who had been sent
by Virginia to drive the Freneh from their settlements on
the bay of Fundy, visited, on his return, the Dutch on
lHudson's river. Claiming the country for his nation, by
right of prior discovery, he demtanded the acknowledgment
of its authority. Being tew in number, they prudently
submitted, withlout attempting to resist.
3. Butt, receiving a reintforcement, the next year, they
again asserted the right of Holland to the country, and
erected fort Amsterdam, on the south end of the island.
The English, for InaiLy years, forebore to interfere in their
pursuits or claims.  In 1621, the reputblic, desirous of
foundinT a colony in America, graxnted to the Dutch West
India Comnpany, an extensive territory on both sides of
the Hudsoni. The country was called New-Netherlands.
The boundaries were not accurately defined, butt were
considered, by the company, as including Connecticut river
at the north, and Delaware river at the south.
4. In 1623, they erected a fort on the Delaware, which
they called Nassau; and, ten years aftewards, another on
the Connecticut, whichl they called Good Hope. Near the
former, the Swedes had a settlement. From the interfering claims of the two nations, quarrels arose between
the settlers, which, after continuing several years, terTt,nated in the subjugation of the Swedes. Towards the
fort on the Connecticut, the settlements of the English
rapidly approached, and soon occasioned disputes, which
had a longer duration and a different result.
5. The Dutch did not escape the calamity of war with
the savages. Hostilities commenced in 1643, continued
several years, and were very destructive to both partialbWilliam Kieft, the governor of the New-Netherlands,
invited captain Underhill, whlo had been a soldier in Europe,
and had made himself conspicuous in New-Hampshire, by
his eccentricities in religion and conduct, to take command
of his troops. Collecting a flying party of one hundred and
fifty men, he was enabled to preserve the Dutch settlemnents
from total destruction. The nuirber of Inidians, whom he
killed in the course of the war, was supposed to exceed
four hundred. In 1646, a severe battle was fought on that
part of Horse-neck called Strickland's Plain. The DtLtch
were victorious; on both sides great numbers were slain;
and for a century afterwards the graves of the dead were
distinctly visible.
6. In 1650, Peter Stuyvesant, then the able governor
of the New-Netherlands, met the commissioners of tihe
New-England colonies at Hartford, where, after much
altercation, a line of partition between their respective
territories was fixed by mutual agreement. Long Island
was divided between them; the Dutch retained the lands
which they occupied in Connecticut, surrendering their
claim to the residue.
7. But Charles II, denying their right to any portion of
the country, determined to expel them from it. In 1664,
he granted to his brother, the duke of York and Albany,
all the territory between Nova Scotia and Delaware bay;
and though England and Holland were then at peace,
immediately sent three ships and three hundred troops to
put him in possession of his grant. Colonel Robert Nichols
conducted the expedition. The squadron, having visited
Boston, reached the place of its destination in August.
8. The commander summoned governor Stuyvesant to)
surrender the town, promising to secure to the inhabitants
their lives, liberty, and property. At first, he refused;
but the magistrates and people, allured by the proffered
terms, cons.trained him to consent. Fort Orange surrendered, soon after, to Sir George Carteret. In compliment
to the duke, the name, Manhattan, was changed to NewYork, and Orange to Albany.
9. Nichols assumed the government of the country lhe
had conquered, and continued, for three years, to rule over
it, with absolute power, but with great lenity and justice.
During his administration, New-York was made a city.
Upon his return to England, he was succeeded by colonel
Lovelace, who administered the governrment with ewvua
moderation.             E 3

G9HIST~ORY
OF THIE
UNITED STATES.
INTRODU CTION.
THE continent of America was probably mlknown to the
ancients. If once known, as some have supposed, to the
Carthiaginians, the Scandinavians, and the Welsh, all
knowledge of it was afterwards lost. The discovery of
this extensive region, constituting nearly one half of the
habitable globe, was the accidental result of the attempts,
made in the fifteenth century, to find a nassage, by sea
from the ports of Europe to the East Indies, whose precious commodities were then transported, over land, by a
long, dangerous, and expensive route.
2. This passage was universally sought by sailing south,
along the western coasts of Europe and Africa, in the hope
of finding the termination of the continent, when the Indies,
it was supposed, might be attained, by taking at first an
easterly and then a northerly coulrse. The discovery of
the Cape of Good Hope, in 1487, encouraged expectation,
and gave increased activity to the spirit of adventure.
3. Among the navigators of that age, Christopher Co.
lumbus, a native of the republic of Genoa, was distinguished for experience and skill in his profession, for extensive
knowledge, and for a bold and original genius. The shape
of the earth, then known to be round, and the fact that
pieces of carved wood, a canoe, and two human bodies, of
a complexion different from that of Europeans, had been
driven, by long westqrly winds, upon the shores of islands
contiguous to Europe, suggested to his observing mind the
project of seeking the East Indies by sailing directly west.
A410. In 1673, England and Holland being then at war, a
few Dutch ships were despatched to reconquer the country.
On lheir arrival at Staten Island, a short distance from the
city, John Manning, who had command of the fort, sent
down a messenger and treacherously made terms with the
enemy.  The Dutch sailed up the harbor, landed their
men, and took possession of the fort and city, without
firing or receiving a shot.
11. Captain Anthony Colve was appointed governor, but
he retained the authority for a few months only. The
next year, peace was concluded, and the country restored(
to the English. The duke obtained a new patent, confirming his title to the province, and appointed mnajor Andross,
the same who was afterwards the tyrant of New-England,
to be governor over his territories in America.
12. Neither the administration of Andross, nor that of
his successor, Anthony Brockholst, was distinguished by
any remarkable event. In 1682, colonel Thomas Dongan,
who, as well as the duke, was a Roman Catholic, was
appointed governor, and the next year arrived in the col(ony.
Until this time, the governor and council had possessed
absolute power. The inhabitants, who, whether Dutch
or English, were born the subjects of a state comparatively
free, having, in an address to the duke, claimred a share in
the legislative authority, colonel Dongan was directed to
allow the freeholders to meet and choose representatives.
13. On the 17th of October, the first assembly met,
consisting of the council and eighteen representatives.
By the declaration of the governor, they were invested
with the sole power of enacting laws and levying taxes;
but the laws could have no force until ratified by the duke.
With this participation of power, the people were gratified
and conte6nted; and the colony began to enjoy the inestimable advartages of a regular government.
14. The interior of New-York was origina'lly inhabited
by a confederacy which consisted at first of five, and afterwards of six, nations of Indians. This confederacy was
formed for mutual defence against the Algonquins, a powerfuI Canadian nation, and displayed much of the wisdom
and sagacity which mark the institutions of a civilized
people. B3y their union, they had become formidable to
the surrounding tribes. Being the allies of the English,
the French were alarmed at their successes, and became
jealous of their power.
15. In 1684, De la Barre, the governor of Cana-,,
INEW-YORK.
I0,a
NEW.YORK.
marched to attack them. with an army of seventeen hundred men. His troops suffered-so much from hardships,
famine, and sickness, that he was compelled to ask peace
of those whomn he had come to exterminate.' He invited
the chiefs of the five nations to meet him at his camp,
and those of three of them accepted the invitation.
Standing in a circle, formed by the chiefs and his own
officers, he addressed a speech to Garrangula, of the
Onondago tribe, in which he accused the confederates of
conducEting the English to the trading grounds of the
French, and threatened them with war and exterminatioa
if they did not alter their beha?vior.
16. Garrangula, knowing the distresses of the Freniich
troops, heard these threats with contempt. After walking
five or six times round the circle, he addressed the following bold and sarcastic language to De la Barre, calling him
Yonnondio, and the English governor, Corlear.
17. "Yonnondio, I honor you, and the warriors that are
with me likewise honor you. Your interpreter has finished
your speech; I now begin mine. My words make haste
to reach your ears; hearken to them. Yonnondio, you
must have believed, when you left Quebec, that the sun
had consumed all the forests which render our country
inaccessible to the French, or that the great lakes had
overflown their banks and surrounded oulr castle3s, so thiat
it was impossible for us to get out of them. Yes, Yonnondio, you must have dreamed so, and the curiosity of so
great a wonder has brought you so far. Now you are undeceived, for I, and the warriors herepresent, are come to
assure you, that the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagos, Oneydoes, and Mohawks, are yet alive.
18. "I thank you, in their name, for bringing back into
their country the pipe of peace, which your predecessor
received from their hands. It was happy for you that
ou left under ground that murdering htchet which has
been so often dyed in the blood of the French. Hear,
Yonncndio, I do not sleep; I have my eyes open, and the
sun which enlightens me, discovers to me a great captain
at the head of a company of soldiers, who speaks as if he
was dreaming. He says that he only came to smoke the
great pipe of peace with the Onondagos. But Garrangula
says, that he sees the contrary; that it was to knock them
on the head, if sickness had not weakened the arms of
the French.
19. "We carried the Englistl to our lakes, to trade thero
E:472~ NEW. YORK.
with the Utawawas, and Quatoghies, as the Adirondacs
brought the French to our castles to carry on a trade which
the Engish say is theirs. We are born free; we neither
depend on ~onnondio nor Corlear. We may go where we
please, and buy and sell what we please. If your allies
are your slaves, use, them as such; command them to
receive no other but your people.
20. "Hear, Yonnondio; what I say is the voice of all
the Five Nations. When they buried the hatchet at
Cadaracui, in the middle of the fort, they planted the tree
of peace in the same place, to be there carefully preserved,
that instead of a retreat for soldiers, the fort might be a
rendezvous for merchants.   Take care that the many
soldiers who appear there, do not choke the tree of peace,
and prevent it ftrom covering your country and ours with
its branches. I assure you that our warriors shall dance
under its leaves, and will never dig up the hatchet to cut
it down, till their brother Yonnondio or Corlear shall
invade the country which the Great Spirit has given to
our ancestors,t"
21. De la I3arre was mortified and enraged at this bold
reply; but, submitting to necessity, he concluded a treaty
of peace, and returned to Montreal. His successor, De
Nonville, led a larger army against the confederates; but
fell into an ambuscade and was defeated. These wars
within the limits of the colony, kept colonel Dongan
actively employed, and served to perpetuate the enmity of
the Indians against the French, and their- attachment to
the English,
22, In the mean time, tle duke of York ascended the
throne of England. Claiming unlimited authority as king,
and professing the Catholic religion, he was hated and
feared by a great portion of the inhabitants, who were
devoted to the cause of freedom, and to the principles of
the protestants.'The governor was also an object of their
dislike and distrust.  Catholics, countenanced by him,
repaired in great numbers to the colony, and pious protest.
ants trembled for their religion.
93. In tlhe beginning of the year 1689, information was
received from England that the people had resolved to
dethrone their sovereign, and offer the crown to Williamn,
prince of Orange; and from Massachusetts, that the citizens
had deposed and imprisoned Sir Edmund Andress, their
governor. This encouraged the disaficted, and preselt.d
sn exmple for their imiatimon.24. Several militia captains assembled to determine on
the measures expedient to be adopted. Of these, Jacob
Leisler was the most active. He was destitute of every
qualification necessary to conduct a difficult enterprise,
but possessed the esteem and confidence of the other
officers, and of the people. Milborne, his son-in-law,
concerted all his measures, and controlled his conduct.
25. They determined to obtain possession of the fort.
Leisler entered it with fifty men, and published a declaration in favour of the prince of Orange. The magistrates
and most respectable citizens discountenaneed the proceeding, and, at first, but few had the courage to declare
themselves his friends. To induce them to act, a report
was circulated that three ships, with orders. from the
prince, were sailing up the harbour. His party was instantly
augmented by six captains, anid nearly five hundred men,
a force sufficient to overpower all opposition.
26. Before these disturbances, colonel Dongan had resigned his office, and embarked for England. Lieutenantgovernor Nicholson, unable to contend with Leisler,
absconded in the night. The province being thus left
without a chief magistrate, Leisler was promoted, by his
adherents, to that station. He sent an address to king
William and queen Mary, whose authority he acknowledged, and9 soon after, a private letter to the king,
expressing, in low and incorrect language, the warmest
protestations of loyalty and zeal.
27. His sudden elevation excited the envy of those
magistrates and citizens who had declined to join him in
proclaiming king William. Bayard and Courtlandt, unablo
to raise a party against him in the city, retired to Albany,
where their exertions were successful. To diminish their
inflaence, and to allay she jealousy of others, he invited
several worthy citizens to unite with him in administering
the government, a trust which had been confided to him
alone, by the militia.
28. In a few months, however, a letter arrived from the
ministry in England, directed "to such as, for the time
being, take care for administering the laws of the province,"
and conferring authority to perform all the duties of lieu.
tenant-governor. Leisler considered this letter addressed
to himself, assumed the authority conferred, appointed his
council, and issued commissions in his own name.
99. The people of Albany, led by Bayard, Courtlandt,
U
NF,W'YORIK-.73ind Livingstonr, acknowledgedking William, but refused to
submit to Leisler. Milborne was sent with a body of
troops to enforce obedience, but, finding them united, he
returned without attempting it. The next spring, going
with a stronger force, he succeeded. The leaders of the
party fled, and theis property was confiscated. This
arbitrary and -unjust measulre so exasperated the sufferers
that they and their posterity long retained the most violent
animosity against Leisler and his adherents.
30. D,.ring these troubles in the colony, war was declared:between France and England. De Nonville being
recalled, count Frontenac was appointed governor of
Canada. In January, 1690, he despatched several parties
against the English settlements. One of these, consisting
of Frenchmen and Caghnuaga Indians, was sent against
Albany, but resolved to attack Schenectady.  To the
inhabitants of this villaga, information was given of theiu
danger; but they, judging it impossible for the enemy to
march several hundred miles in the depth of winter,
disregarded the intelligence. No regular watch was kept
nor military order observed.
31. The French and Indians arrived near the town o~
the eighth of February. They divided their number inte
small parties, that every house mighlt be invested at the
same time., On Saturday night, at eleven o'clock, the)
entered at; the gates which they found unshut. The in.
habitants having retired to rest, universal stillness reigned
Suddenly, in every quarter, the horrid yell was heard.
They sprang from their beds, conscious of the dangel
which surrounded them. Opening their doors, they met
the savages, with uplifted tomahawks, on the threshold.
Each, at the samrne instant, heard the cry of his affrighted
neighbor. Soon seceeded the groans of tile dying. In a
few minutes, the buildings were on fire. Women were
butchered, and children thrown alive into the flames. The
Indians, frantic from slauglter, ran, with fatal: haste,
throughi the village, massacreing many, who, in their
attempts to escape, were betrayed by the light of thei
own houses.
32. Some eluded their pursuers; but a fate almost as
dreadful awaited them. They were naked; a furious
storm came on; Albany, their only refuge, was at a distance; and often.their terror converted into savages the
trees and wild beasts which they saw in their flight. Part

NE W:YORKoNEW-YORK                        75
arrived in safety; twenty-five lost their limbs by the
severity of the cold. At Schenectady, sixty were killed,
and twenty-five made prisoners.
33. To avenge these barbarities, and others perpetrated
in New-England, a combined expedition against Canada
was projected. An army, raised in New- ork and Connecticut, proceeded as far as the head of lake Champlain,
whence, finding no boats prepared, they were obliged to
return. Sir William Phipps, with a fleet of more than
thirty vessels, sailed from Boston into the St. Lawrence,
and, landing a body of troops, made an attack by land and
water upon Quebec; but the return of the army to NewYork, allowing the whole force of the enemy to repair to
the assistance of the garrison, he was obliged to abandon
the enterprise.  To the misc,nduct or incapacity of
Leisler and Milborne, the failure of this expedition was
attributed.
34. As soon as king William could find leisure to attend
to his colonies, he appointed colonel Henry Sloughter
governor of New-York. Never was a governor more
necessary to the province, and never, perhaps, has it been
ruled by one less qualified for the station.  ie was destitute of talents, licencious, avaricious and a bankrupt.
35. Leisler, when informed of this appointment, ought
to have relinquished the aulthority he had exercised; but
he was weak, intoxicated with power, and determined to
retain it. Alt'ough twice required, he refused to surrender the fort; but sent two persons to confer with the
goverror, who, declaring them rebels, arrested and confined them. Alarmed by this measure, Leisler attempted
to escape, but was apprehended, with many of his adherents, and brought to trial.
36. In vain did they plead their zeal for king William.
In vain did Leisler insist that the letter from England
authorized hinm to adtninister the government. They had
lately resisted a governor with a regular commission, and
thiis governor, and a subservient court, were resolved upon
their conviction. Leisler and Milborne were condemned
to death for high treason.
37. Soon after their trial, the affairs of the province
required Sloughter's presence at Albany.  The faction
opposed to them, entreated him, before his departure, to
sign the warrant for their execution; but he, unwilling
to sacrifice two men, who, though they had sometimes
erred, had served his master with zeal, refused., UnableNEW-YORK.
to effect their l)urpose by persuasion, they resorted to a
detestable expedient. A sumptuous feast was prepared,
to which the governor was invited. When he had drunk
to intoxication, they presented him the warrant, which he
signed, and when he had recovered his senses, the prisoners were no more.
38. On application to the king, their estates, which had
been confiscated, were restored to their heirs. Their
bodies were afterwards taken up and interred, with great
pomp, in the old Dutch church; and their descendants are
considered honored, rather than disgraced, by the conduct
and fall of their ancestors.
39. In July, 1691, Sloughter, having returned from
Albany, ended, by a sudden death, a short, weak, and
turbulent administration. About the same time, major
Peter Sciuyler, at the head of three hundred Mohawks,
made a sudden a,d bold attack upon the French settlemnents, at the north end of Lake Champlain. An army of
eight hundred nimen was despatched from Montreal to
oppose him. With these he had several irregular, but
successful conflicts; in which lihe killed a number of the
enemy, greater than that of his whole party.
40. In 1692, colonel Fletcher arrived as successor to
Sloughter. He was a good soldier, was active, avaricious,
and passionate. From the talents and information ofmajor Schuyler, he derived great assistance, and was
goveried by his advice, particularly in tral.sactions relative to the Indians.
41. As a great portion of the inhabitants were Dutch,
all the governors, to produce uniformity in religion and
language, had encouraged English preachers and schoolmasters to settle in the colony.  No one pursued this
object with more zeal than Fletcher, who was devoted to
the church of England. At two successive sessions, he
recommlended the subject to the attention of the assembly;
but the members, being generally attached to the church
of Holland, disregarded his recommendations. For this
neglect, he gave them a severe reprimand.
42. The subject being laid before them, at a subsequent
session, they passed a bill providing for the settlement, in
certain parishes, of ministers of the gospel, to be chosen
by the people. The council added an amendment, giving
to the governor the power of approval or rejection. The
house refused to concur in the amendment, at which
Fletcher was so much enraged, that he commanded then
76instantly to attend him, and, addressing them in an angry
speech, prorogued them to the next year.
43. In 1697, a peace, which gave security and repose to
the colonies, was concluded between Great Britain and
France. The next year, the earl of Bellamont was appointed governor. He was particularly instructed to clear
the American seas of the pirates who infested them, and
who, it was suspected, had even received encouragement
from Fletcher.
44.'The government declining to filrnish the necessary
naval force the earl engaged, with others, in a private
undertaking against them. The associates, pr(ocuring a
vessel of war, gave the command of it to a captain Kid,
and sent him to cruise against the pirates. He had beeni
but a short time at sea, whlen, disregarding his instructions,
he made a new contract with his crew, and, on the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans, became hinmself a daring, atrocious,
and successful pirate.
45. Three years afterwards, he returned, burned his
ship, and, with a strange infatuation, appeared publicly at
Boston. He was apprehended and sent to England, where
he was tried and executedl. The earl and his partuers,
somne of whom  resided in England, were accused of
sharing in his plunder, but in all his examinations he
declared them innocent.
46. Notwithstanding the death of Lcisler, tlhe people
were still divided into Leislerians and anti-Leislerians.
Fletcher had been the instrument of the latter; Lord
Bellamont espoused the cause of the former. He, however, persecuted no one; but exercised authority withl
justice and moderation. He died in 1701.
47. The next year, lord Cornbury was appointed
governor. He presented a striking proof of the folly of
hereditary distinctions. He was the so1 of the celebrated
earl of Clarendon; but possessed not one of the virtues
of his ancestor. Mean, profligate, and unprincipled, he
was a burden to- his friends at home, and was sent to
America to be beyond the reach of his creditors.  t
48. He declared himself an anti-Leislerian, and the first
assembly that he summoned was composed principally of
men of that party. They presented him two t;lousand
pounds to defray the expenses of his voyage. Tney raised
several sums of money for public purposes, but the expenditure being intrnsted to him as governor, he appropriated most Gt it to his own use.

49. His acts of injustice and oppression; his prodigality~
his indecent and vulgar manners, rendered him universally
odious. In 1708, the assemblies of New-York and of
New-Jersey, of which colony he was also governor, complained to the queen of his misconduct. She removed himn
from office; he was soon after arrested by his creditors.
and remained in custody until the death of his illustrious
father, u hen he returned to England and took his seat in
the house of lords.
50. A proceeding of the house of representatives, nrear
the close of his administration, ought not to be passed
over without notice. Wearied by their sufferings, they
appointed a committee of grievances, who reported a series
of resolutions having reference to recent transactions,
which resolutions were adopted by the house. One of
them, in explicit language, asserted the principle, "thfat
the imposing and levying of any mnoneys upon her majesty's
subjects of this colony, under any pretence or colour
whatsoever, without consent in general assembly, is a
grievance and a violation of the people's property." It is
not uninstructive to observe how early, in some of the
colonies, were sown the seeds of the American revolution.
51. In 1710, general Hunter, who had been appointed
governor, arrived in the province. He brought with him
near three thousand Gernians, some of whom settled in
New-York, and' some in Pennsylvania. The latter transmitteda to tteir native land such favourable accoIIunts of
the country which they had chosen for their residence,
that many others fi)ollowed and settled in that colony.
T'he nullmlerous descendants of these Germans are.honest,
industrious, and usefill citizens.
62.'I'he prodigality of lord Cornbury, had- taught the.
assemnbly an important leskson. Belbre his removal, they
had obtained from the queen permission, in cases of special
appropriations to appoint their own treasurer. They now
passed a bill confiding to this officer the disbursement of
certain sums appropriated for ordinary purposes. The
council proposed an amendment. The house denied the
right of that body to amend a money bill. Both continuing
obstinate, the governiior prorogued them, and at their next
session dissolved them.
53. At this time, war existed between England arnd
France. In 1709, expensive preparations were made for
an attack upon Canada, but the promnised assistance not
ariving fiom England, the enterlprise was abantdoned. In1711l, the project was resumned.  A fleet sailed up the
St. Lawrence, to attack Quebec; and an army of fol.r
thousand men, raised by New-York, New-Jersey, and
Connecticut, marched to invade Canada, by the route ol
Lake Champlain. The fleet, shattered by a storm, was
compelled to return. The army, informed of the disasters
of the fleet, returned also, having accomplished nothing.
54. The people, approving the conduct of their repre
sentatives in relation to the revenu:e, had re-elected
nearly all of them, and they were now in session. To
defray the expenses of the late expedition, they passed
several bills which were amended in the council. Between these two bodies, another contest ensued. The
representatives, deriving their authority from the people,
considered themselves bound to watch over the expenditutre of their money. T'he council, deriving their authority
from the same source as the governor, we-e desirous of
increasing his influence by giving him the management of
the revenue. During this, and a subsequent session, both
continued inflexible.  The governor, provoked at the
obstinacy of the representatives, dissolved the assembly.
55. At the ensuing election, which was warmly coIIntested. most of the members chosen, were opposed to the
governor  This assembly was dissolved by the death of
the queen. The next was dissolved by the governor, soon
after it first met, a majority of the representatives being
known to be unfriendly to his views. The people became
weary of contending. Most of the members chlosen at the
3ucceeding election, were his friends and partisans, and,
for several years, the utmost harmony existed between
the different branches of the government.
56. Governor Hunter quitted the province in 1719, and
his authority devolved on Peter Schulyler, the oldest
mnember of the council. The next year, William Burnet,
son of the celebrated bishop of that name, was appointed
governor. Turning his attention towards the wilderness,
he perceived that the French, in order to connect their
settlements in Canada and Louisiana, to secure to themselves the Indian trade, and to confine the English to the
sea coast, were busily employed in erecting a chain of
forts from the St. Lawrence to the Mississippi.
57. He endeavored to defeat their design, by building a
trading house, and afterwards a fort, at Oswego, on Lake
Ontario.  But the French had the commannd of more
abundant resources, and applied them to chde *ccc,mplishNEW-YORK,

5, For a long tine he solicited in vain. At length the
queen persuaded by his representations, became his friend
and patron. By her directions, tllree small vessels were
fitted out, and he was authorised to sail with these upon
his projected voyage of discovery. On the third of Alu.
gust, 1492, he departed from Palos, in Spain, directing his
course towards the Canary Islands.
6, He stopped there to refit, and, on the sixth of Sep.
ternber, boldly adventured into seas which no vessel had
yet entered, with no chart to direct him, no guide but his
comrnpass, and without any knowledge of the tides or currents which might interrtpt his course. He nmoved rapidly

ment of their object, with great activity and zeal. They
launched two vessels upon that lake; and, going farther
into the wilderness, erected a fort at Niagra, commanding
the entrance into it; they had previcusly erected fort
Frontenae, commanding the outlet.
58. The assembly, elected in 1716, had been so obsequious to the governor, that he continued it in existence
until the clamors of the people induced himn, in 1727, to
dissolve it., That which next met, was composed entirely
of his opponenits. The court of chancery, in which he
presided, had become exceedingly unpopular. It had been
instituted by an ordinance of the governor and council,
without the concurrence of the assembly; the mode of
proceeding was novel; and some of the decisions had
given great offence to powerful individuals. The house
passed resolutions declaring it "a manifest oppression
and grievance,' and intimating that its decrees were void.
The governor instantly called the assembly before him,
and dissolved it.
59. Being soon after appointed governor of Massachlusetts, he was succeeded by colonel Montgomery, upon
whose death, in 1731, the supreme authority devolved
upon Rip Van Dam, the senior member of the co,incil.
Under his shlort and inefficient administration, the French
were permitted to erect a fort at Crown Point, within the
- acknowledged boundaries of New-York, from whichl parties of savages were often secretly despatched to destroy
the English settlements.
60. Van Dam was superseded by William Cosby, who
arrived n August, 1732. Having been the advocate, in
parliamnent, of the American colonies, he was at first
popular, but soon lost the affection and confidence of the
people. By his instigation, one Zenger, the printer of a
newspaper, was prosecuted for publishing-an article declared to be derogatory to the dignity of his majesty's
government. He was zealously defended by able counsel,
and an independent jury gave a verdict of acquital. The
people applauded their conduct, and the magistrates of the
city of New-York presented to Andrew Hamilton, one of
his defenders, the freedom of the city, in a gold box, and
their thanks for "his learned and generous defence of the
rights of mankind, and the liberty of the press."
61. Governor Cosby died in 1736, and was succeeded
by George Clark, at that time senior counsellor, but soon
after app(oiinted lieutenant-go'ernor. Again was revivedNEW-YORK,                        3i
the contest which had ended, twenty years befbre, In the
victory gained by governor Hunter, over the house of
representatives. The colonily being in debt, the house
voted to raise the sum of six thousand pounds; but, in
order to prevent its misapplication, declared, that it
should be applied to the payment of certain specified
debts. Offended by this vote, Clark resorted to the expedient whiclh had usuully been adopted to punish or
intimidate; he immediately dissolved the assembly.
62. At the next election, great-exertions were made
by the opposing parties. The popular party was triumphant. At their second session, the house voted an
address to the lieutenant-governor, which is worthy of
particular notice. In bold and explicit language, they
state somre of the vital principles of free government,
refer to recent misapplications of money, and prooeed:
63. "We therefore beg leave to be plain with your
honor, and hope you will not take it amiss when we tell
you, that you are not to expect that we will either raise
sums unfit to be raised, or put what we shall raise, into
the power of a governor to misapply, if we-can prevent
it; nor shall we make up any other deficiencies than
what we conrceive are fit and just to be paid; nor continue what support or revenue we shall raise, for any
lonrer time than one year; nor do we think it convenient
to do even that, until such laws are passed as we conceive
necessary for the safety of the inhabitants of this colony,
who have reposed a trust in us for that only purpose, and
which we are sure you will think it reasonable we should
act agreeably to; and by the grace of God we shall
endeavor not to deceive them."
64. With a body of men, so resolute in asserting theii
rights, the lieutenant-governor wisely forebore to contend.
ire thanked them for their address, and promised his
cordial co-operation in all mneasures calculated to promote
the prosperity of the colony. He gave his assent to a
law providing for the mnore frequent election of representatives; which law, however, two years afterwards, was
abrDgated by the king.
65. But between a house of representatives and a chlief
magistrate, deriving their authority from different sources,
harmony could not long subsist. Mr. Clark, in hlis speech
at the opening of the next session, declared that unless
the revenue was granited for as long a time as it had been
granted by former assemblies, his duty to his majestV
ENEW-YORK.
forbade him from assenting to any act for contlnuing the
excise, or for paying the colonial bills of credit. The
house unanimously resolved, that it would not pass any bill
for the grant of money, unless assurance should be given
that the excise should be continued and the bills of credit
redeemned.
66. The lieutenant-governor immediately ordered the
members to attend him. He told them that "their proceedings were presumptuous, daring, and unprecedented:
that he could not look vupon them without astonishment,
nor withI honor suffer the house to sit any longer;" and he
accordingly dissolved it. Little more than a year had
elapsed, since the members were cilosen; but in that tilme
they had, by their firm and spirited conduct, in support of
the rights of the people, merited the gratitude of their
constituents.
67. About this time, a supposed "negro plot" occasioned
great commotion and alarm in the city of New-Yorlk.
The frequent occurrence of fires, most of which were
evidently caused by design, first excited the jealousy and
suspicion of the citizens.  Terrified by danger whicti
lurked unseen in the midst of them, they listened with
eager credulity to the declaration of some abandoned
fernmales, that the negroes had combined to burn the city
and make one of their number governor. Many were
arrested and committed to prison. Other witnesses, not
more respectable than the first, came bforward; other
negroes-were accused, and even several white men were
designated as concerned in the plot.
68. When the time of trial arrived, so strong was the
prejudice against the miserable negroes, that every lawyer
mn the city volunteered against them.  Ignorant and
unassisted, nearly all who were tried were conderrmned.
Fourteen were sentenced to be burned, eighteen to be hung,
seventy-one to be transported, and all these sentences
were executed. Of the whites two were convicted axnd
suffered death.
69. All apprehension of danger having subsided, many
began to doubt whether any plot had in fact beer concerted
None of the witnesses were persons of credit, their stories
were extravagant and often conItradictory and the project
was such as none but fools or madmen would form. The
two white men were respectable; one had received a
liberal education, but he was a Catholic, and the prejudice
spinst Catholics was too violent to permnit the free exercise of reason. Some of the accused were doubtless guilty
of setting fire to the city; but the proof of the alleged plot
was not sufficiently clear to justify the numerous and cruel
punishments that were inflicted.
70. In April, 1740, the assembly again met. It had
now risen to importance in the colony. The adherence of
the representatives to their determination, not to grant the
revenue for more than one year, made annual meetings
of the assembly necessary. This attachment to liberty
was mistaken for the desire of independence. Lieutenantgovernor Clark, in a speech delivered in 1741, alludes to
"a jeaJousy which for some years had obtained in England, that the plantations were not without thoughts of
throwing off their dependence on the crown."
71. In 1743, George Clinton was sent over as governor
of the colony. Likle most of his predecessors he was
welcomed with joy; and one of his earliest measures
confirmed the favorable accounts, which had preceded
him, of his talents and liberality. To show his willingness
to repose confidence in the people, he assented to a bill
limiting the duration of the present and all succeeding
assemnblies.  The house manifested its gratitude by
adopting the measures he recommended for the defence
of the province against the French, who were then at war
with England.
72. In 1745, the savages in alliance with France made
freq(ldent invasions of the English territories.  The inhabitants were comnpelled to desert Hosick; Saratoga was
destroyed; the western settlements in New-England were
often attackled and plundered. Encouraged by success,
the enemy became more daring, and small parties ventured
within the suburbs of Albany, and there lay in wait for
prisoners. It is even said that one Iadian, called Tomonwilemon, often entered the city and succeeded in taking
captives.
73. Distressed by these incursions, the assembly, in
1746, determined to unite with the other colonies and the
mnother country in an expedition against Canada. They
appropriated money to purchase provisiou;s for the army,
%nd offered liberal bounties to recruits. But the fleet from
England did not arrive at the ap)poiPted time: the other
colonies were dilatory in thLeir preparations, and before
the) were completed, the s3ason for military operations
iiad piassed away.
74. Early in the next year. a treaty was concluded, and

e8the inhabitants were, for a shlort period, relieved from the
burdens and distresses of war. During the interval of
peace, no event of importance happened in the colony.
Upon the recurrence, a few years afterwards, of hostilities,
its territory was the theatre of sanguinary conflicts.. But
of that war, in which all the colonies acted in concert, a
connected history will be hereafter given.
CHAPTER VII.
NEW-JERSEY.
Tnz first settlement within the limits of New-Jersey
was miade by the Danes, about the year 1624, at a place
called Bergen, from a city of that nanme in Norway. Soon
afterwards, several Dutch families seated themselves in
the vicinity of New-Yorkl. In 1626, a company was
formed in Sweden, under the patronage of king Gustavus
Adolphus, for the purpose of lianting a colony in America.
The next year, a number of Swedes and Finilis camne over,
purchased of the natives the land on both sides of the river
Delaware, but made their first settlement on its western
bank, near Christina creek.
2. Abouit the year 1640, the English began a plantation
at Elsingburgh, on its eastern bank.  The Swedes, in
concert with the Dutcth who then possessed New-York,
drove them out of the country. The former built a forl
on the spot whence the English had been driveti; and,
gaining thus the command of the river, claimed and exercised authority over all vessels that entered it, even those
of the Dutch, their late associates.
3. They continued in possession of the country, on bot;
sides of the Delaware, until 1655, when Peter Stuyvesant,
governor of the New-Netherlands, having obtained assistance from Holland, conquered all their posts and trans.
ported most of the Swedes to Europe. The Dutch were
now in possession of the territory comprising, at this time,
the states of New-Jersey, New-York, and Delaware.
4. Soon, however, -his territory-changed masters. King
Charles II, having granted it to the duke of York, sent at?
armament, in 1664, to wrest it from the Dutch. Aftel
reducing New-York, the squadron proceeded to the settleAnents on the Delaware, which imm-ediately submitted
84
NEW.JERSEY.In the same year, the duke conveyed that portion of his
grant, lying between Hudson and Delaware rivers, to lord
Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. This tract was called
New-Jersey, in compliment to Sir George, who had been
governor of the island of Jersey, and had held it for king
Charles in his contest with the parliament.
5. The two proprietors formed a constitution for the
colony, securing e(qual privileges and liberty of conscience
to all, and appointed Philip Carter-t governor. Hle came
over in 1665, fixed the seat of government at Elizabethtown, purchased land of the Indians, and sent agents intc
New-England to inivite settlers from that quarter. Thl
terms offered were so favorable that many accepted the
invitation.
6. A few years afterwards, the repose of the colony began
to be disturbed by domestic disputes. Some of the inhabitants, having purchased their lands of the Indians previous
to the conveyance from the duke, refused to pay rent to
the proprietors. Others were discontented from different
causes. In 1672, an insurrection took place, the people
assumed thle government, and chose James Carteret, the
son of Philip, their governor. The father returned to
England, and obtained from the proprietors such favorable
concessions and promnises as quieted the people, and
induced them again to submit to his authority.
7. Lord Berkeley disposed of his property, rights, and
privileges in the territory, to Edward Billinge; and he,
being involved in debt, consented that they should be sold
for the benefit of his creditors. WILLIAm PENN, Gawen
Lowrie, and Nicholas Lucas, were appointed trustees for
that purpose. In 1676, the trustees and Sir George Carteret made partition of the territory, they taking the western
and he the eastern portion.
8. West-Jersey was then divided into one hundred
shares, which were separately sold. Some of the purchasers emigrated to the country, and all made great
exertions to promote its population.  Possessing the
powers of government, as well as the right of soil, they
formed a constitution, in which, for the encouragement of
emigrants, they secured to them ample privileges.
9. But previous to the transfer fiom Berkeley to Billinge
the Dutch, being at war with England, reconquered the
country, and retainred it, until 1674, when it was restored
by treaty. A new patent was then granted to the duke,
including the same territory as the former. In 1678, Sir
F3
NEW-JERSEY.
85rEdmun4 Andross, who had been appointed his sole governoin America, claimed jurisdiction over the Jerseys, insisting
that the conquest by the Dutch divested the proprietors
of all their rights.
10. He forcibly seized, transported to New-York, arid
there imprisoned those magistrates who refused to acknowledge his authority. He imposed a duty upon all goods
imported, and upon the property of all who came to settle
in the country. Of this injustice the inhabitants loudly
coniplained to the duke; and at length their repeated
remonstrances constrained him to refer the matter to
commissioners.
11. Before them the proprietors appeared. In strong
language they asserted, and by strong arguments supported,
their claim to the privileges offreemen. They represented,
that the king had granted to the duke the right of government as well as the right of soil; That the duke had
transferred the same rights to Berkeley and Carteret, and
they to the present proprietors.
12. "That only," they added, "could have induced us
to purchase lands and emigrate. And the reason is plain;
to all prudent men, the government of any place is more
inviting than the soil; for what is good landwithout good
laws. What but an assurance that we should enjoy civil
and religiotus privileges, could have tempted us to leave a
cultivated country. and resort to a gloomy wilderness?
What have we gained, if, after adventuring in this wilderness many thousands of pounds, we are yet to be taxed at
the mere will and pleasure of another  What is it but to
say, that people, free by law under their prince at home,
are at his mercy in his plantations abroad?
13. "We humbly say, that we have lost none of ouI
liberty by leaving our country; that the duty imposed upon
us is without precedent or parallel; that, had we foreseen
it, we should have preferred any other plantation in America. Besides, there is no limit to this power; since we
are, by this precedent, taxed Without any law, and thereby
excluded from our English right of assenting to taxes;
what security have we of any thing we possess? We can
call nothing our own, but are tenants at will, not only for
the soil, but for our personal estates. Such conduct has
destroyed governments, b!:t never raised one to any true
greatness."
14. The commissioners adjudged the duties illegal and
oppres&amp;ive, and they were not- afterwards demanded,
86
NEW-JERSEYY.tmrigrants continued to arrive and the country to.prospe.
In 1681, the governor of West-Jersey sumimoned a general assembly, by which several fundamental laws were
enacted, establishing the rights of the people, and defining
the powers of ruleIs.
15. In 1682 the territory of East-Jersey passed from
Carteret to William Penn, and twenty-three associates,,mostly of the Quaker persuasion. They appointed Rebert
Barclay, author of the "Apology for the Quakers," governor over it for life. The multitude of proprietors, and the
frequent transfers and subdivisions of shares, introduced
such confusion in titles to laud, and such uncertainty as to
the rights of government, that, for twenty years afterwards
both lerseys were in a state of continued disturbance and
disorder. In 1702, the proprietors, weary of contending
with each other, and with the people, surrendered the
right of government to the crown. Queen Anne reunited the two divisions, and appointed lord Cornbury
go-ernor over the provinces of New-Jersey anid New-York.
16. These provinces continued, for several years, to be
ruled by the same governor, but each chose a separate
assembly. In 173S, the inhabitants, by petition to the,ing, desired that they might, in future, have a separate
governor. Their request was granted, Lewis Morris being
t'.e first tnat was appointed.
17. In the same year, a college was founded at Princeton and called Nassau Hall. New.Jersey then contained
above forty thousand inhabitants. Being remote from
Canada, the source of most of t)e Indian wars which
afflicted the northern colonies, it enjoyed a complete
exemptioli from that terrible calamity, and Until the commencemeint of the revolution, furnished no materials for
history.
CHAPTER VIII.
DELAWARE.
TIllS colony was first settled by a conmpany of Swedes
and Finns, under the patronage of king Gustavus Adolphus.
They came over in 1627, and landing at cape Hlenlopen,
were so charmed withl its appearance, that they gave it
the nnoe of Paradise Point. The country they oalled
LS:9
DIELAWAREA'New-Sweden, and the river Delaware, New-Swedeland
Stream. They purchased of the Indians the lands on both
sides of that river, from the sea to the falls, and seated
themselves at the mouth of Christina creek, near Wilmington.
2. Being frequently molested by the Dutch, who claimed
a right to the country, they, for their protection, bult forts
at Chlistina, Lewistown, and Tinicum.- The last was
their seat of government, and there John Printz, their
governor, erected an elegant mansion which he named
Printz Hall.
3. In 1651, the Dutch bcilt a fort at New-Castle.
Printz, considering this place to be within the Swedish
territories, formally protested against the proceeding.
Risingh, his successor, made a visit, under the guise of
friendship, to the commander of the fort, and, being accompanied by thirty men, treacherously took possession of
it, while enjoying his hospitality.
4. Peter Stuyvesant, the. Dutch governor of'New-Yerk,
was not of a temrnper to permit an injury thus committed, to
pass unavenged. Accompanied by an armament, a part of
which was furnished for the occasion by the city of Amsterdam, in Holland, he,in 1655, returned the visit of the
Swedes. He first reduced the fort at New-Castle; then
thlat at Christina creek, where Risingh commanded; and
afterwards the others. Some of the Swedes, on taking
the oath of allegiance to IHolland, were permitted to
remain; the rest were sent to Europe.
5. The settlements on the Delaware continued under the
control of the Dutch, until 1664, when the New-Nether.
lands were conquered by the English. They were then
considered as a part of New-York. In 1682, William
Penn purchased of the duke of York, the town of NewCastle, and the country twelve miles around it; and by a
-stlbsequent purchase, obtained the land lying upon the
Delaware, and between New-Castle and cape Henlopen.
These tracts, which constitute the present state of Dela.
ware, were called the "Territories," and were, for twenty
years, governed as a part of Pennsylvania.
6. They were divided into three counties, New-Castle,
Kent, and Sussex, each of which sent six delegates to the
general assembiy. In 1703, these delegates, dissatisfied
with the last charter which Penn had prepared, and a
majority of the assembly had adopted, seceded, and, liberty
Weing given, formed a separate and distinct assembly. The

two portions of the province were never afterwards united,
but the proprietor continued to possess the same jurisdiction, and the same person uniformly acted as governor
over both.
7. Sheltered by the surrounding provinces, Delaware
enjoyed an entire exemption from wars, except those in
which, as a part of the British empire, she was obliged to
participate. In the war with France, which terminated
in 1763, she was second to none in active zeal to assist
the parent state. In the revolutionary war, the Delaware
regiment was considered the most efficient in the continental army.
CHAPTER IX.
PENNSYLVANIA.
WILLIAMr PENN, the founder of Pennsylvania, was the
son of Sir William Penn, an admiral in the British navy.
In his youth, he joined the quakers, then an obscure and
persecutted sect. WThile superintending the settlement of
New-Jersey, he became acquainted with an extensive
tract of fertile, unoccupied land lying between the terri
tories of the-duke of York and lerd Baltimore. At his
solicitation, and in recompense for unrequited services
which his father had rendered the nation, this tract was,
in 1681, granted to him in full property, and by the king
called Pennsylvania.
2. Desirous of selling his lands and founding a colony,
he, in a public advertisement, described the country, and
set forth the advantages which it offered to emigrants.
Many persons, chiefly quakers, were induced to purchase.
The fee simple of the soil was sold at the rate of twenty
pounds for every thousand acres; and they who rented
lands, agreed to pay one penny yearly per acre. Before the
emigrants embarked, certain " conditions and concessions"
were by them and the proprieto agreed upon and subscribed.
3. In the fall, three ships, carrying settlers,:sailed for
Pennsylvania. The pious and philanthropic proprietor
sent a letter to the Indians, informing them that "the
great God had been pleased to m-eke him concerned in
their part of the world, and that the king of the country
where he lived, had given him a great province therein;
II S

whole squadron. The men blamed their sovereign for
listenirng to the schemes of a dreaming adventurer. The
indictions of land had all proved fallacious. They would
be amused and deceived no longer. They agreed that Columnbus shlould be forced to relinquish an undertaking which
seemed to promise nothing but destruction; and some of
the more daring talked of throwing him into the sea, as a
visionary projector, whose death would cause no regret,
and produce no inquiry.
10. Amidst these difficulties, Columbus displayed those
traits of character which proved the greatness of his mind,
and his peculiar fitness for the arduous duties of his station. He appeared with a steady and cheerful countenance,
as if satisfied with what he had done. Sometimes he
soothed his companions by holding out to them a prospect
of riches and of fame, and by offering a gratuity to him
who should first discover land. - Sometimes he assumed a
tone of authority,,threatening them with the vengeance of
their sovereign, ard everlasting infamy, should they compel him to abandon the undertaking.
11, These encouragements and threats prevented open
and forcible resistance to his authority. Meanwhile the
squadron proceeded onward; the indications of land had
become frequent, and convinced him that it could not be
far distant. But his crew were unconvinced, and their
discontent illcreased. Assembling tumultuously on deck,
they demanded to be conducted back to Spain. As a last
expedient, he proposed that they should continue on their
course three days longer, and if, in that time, land should
not be discovered, he would then complywith their demand.
12. They consented. Before the time expired, Columbus, on the 11th of October, at midnight, saw a light glim.
mering at a distance. "A light! a light!" was the joyful
exclamation, which instantly resounded through the squadron. On the approach of morning, all hands stood gazing
intently in the direction where land, it was expected, wouldke discovered.
13. Soor, on board the Pinta, the most forward vessel,
was heard the cry of" Land! land!" which was repeated,
with almost frantic delight, by the crews of the other yes
sels, Passing from one extreme to the other, they, who a
few days before had reviled and insulted their commander,
nIIow regarded him as one whom the Deity had endowed
with knowledge and penetration above the common ot of
mortals,pPENNSVLVANIA.
but that he did not desire to enjoy it without their consent
that he was a man of peace; and that the people whom
lIe senrt were of the same disposition and if any diffelence should happen between them, it might be adjusted
by an equal number of men chosen on both sides."  The
position selected by these emigrants for a settlement was
above the confluence of the Delaware and the Schuylkill.
4. In April, 1682, Penn published a Frame of Govern.
ment, the chief object of which was declared to be "to
support power in reverence with the people, and to secure
the people from the abuse of power."  He published also
a Body of Laws, which had been examined and approved
by the emigrants in England; and which, says an eminent
historian, "does great honor to their wisdom as statesmen,
to their morals as men, and to their spirit as colonists."
From the duke of York,- he obtained the relinquishment
of a tract of land, lying on the south side of the Delaware,
a part of which was already settled, and in August, ac^ompanied by about two thousand emigrants, set sail for
America.
5. He landed first at New-Castle, which was a part of
the "Territories," as the land conveyed to him by the
duke was called. Upon this tract he found about three
thousand Dutch, Swedes, and Finns. He proceeded to
Chester, where he called an assembly on the fourth of
December. This assembly annexed the Territories to
the province, adopted the Frame of Government, and
enacted in form the Body of Laws. Penn also made a
treaty with the Indians, from whom he purchased as much
land as the circumstances of the colony required.  He
selected the site, and marked out the plan, of anextensive
city, to which he gave the name of Philadelphia, or the
city of love. -Before the end of the year, it contained
eighty houses and cottages.
6. The settlement of none of the colonies commenced
under such favourable auspices as that of Pennsylvania.
The experience of half a century had disclosed the evils
to be avoided, and pointed out the course to be pursued.
The Indians, having been already taught to tbar the power
of the whites, were the more easily conciliated by their
kindness. The soil being fertile, the climnate temperate,
and the game abundant, the first emigrants escaped most
of the calamities w:ich afflicted the more northern and
southern provinces. The increase of population exceededi
of course, all former example
9vPENNSYLVANIA.
7. In the new city, a second assembly was held in
March, 1683. At the request of the freemen and delegates,
Penn granted them a second charter, which diminished the
number of the council and assembly, and was, in other
respects, different from thle first. Some of the regulations,
at that time adopte.1, bear the impress of the proprietor's
singular genius, and benevolent disposition.
8. It was ordained "that, to prevent lawsuits, thlee
arbitrators, to be called peace-makers, should be chosen
by the county coirts, to hear and determine small differences between man and man: That children should be
taught some useful trade, to the end that none might be
idle, that the poor might work to live, and the rich if they
should become poor: That factors, wronging their employers, should make satisfaction and one third over: That
every thing, which excites the people to rudeness, cruelty,
and irreligion, should be discouraged and severely punished:
That no one, acknowledging-one God and living peaceably
in society, should be molested for his opinions or his
pract ice, or compelled to frequent or maintain any ministry
whatever."
9. These judicious regulations attracted numerous
emigrants; and to their salutary influence must be attributed the qualities of diligence, order, and economy fbr
which the Pennsylvanians are so justly celebrated.
Within four years from the date of the grant to Penn,
the province contained twenty-settlements, and Philadelphliia two thousand inhabitants.
10. In 1684, the proprietor returned to England. He
left his province in profound tranquillity, under the admniinistration of five commissioners chosen from the
council. The unfortunate James II. soon after ascended
tne throne. "As he has," said Penn, "been my friend,
aiid my father's friend, I feel bound in justice to be a friend
to him." He adhered to him while seated on the thlione,
and for two years after he was expelled from his kingdom,
tite government of the province was administered in his
name.
11. By this display of attachment to the exiled monarch,
he incurred tke displeasure of king William. On vague
suspicion, and unfounded charges, he was four timnes imprisoned. The government of his colony was taken from
him, and given to colonel Fletcher, the governor of NewYork. But by the severest scrutiny, it was rendered
apparent, that he had, in all his conduct, been actutated as
9t.PENNSYLVANIA.
much by the love of his country as by personal gratitude.
He regained the good opinion of king William; and, being
permitted to resume and exercise his rights, appointed
William Markham to be his deputy governor.
12. In 1699, he again visited Pennsylvania, and found
the people discontented. They compla;ned that his powers
and their rights were not defined with sufficient precision,
and demanded a new charter. In 1701, he prepared and
p:esented one to the assembly, which was accepted. It
gave to the assembly the right of originating bills, which,
by the previous charters, was the right of the governor
alone, and of amending or rejecting. those which might be
laid before them. To the governor it gave the right of
rejecting bills passed by the assembly, of appointing his
own council, and of exercising the whole executive power.
The Territories, now the state of Delaware, refusing to
accept the new charter, separated from Pennsylvania, and
were allowed a distinct assembly. The same governor,
however, presided over both.
13. Immediately after his third charter was accepted,
Penn returned to England, and the executive authority
was afterwards administered bydeputygovernors appoinited
by the proprietor. The people incessantly murmured and
complainaed; but the uninterrupted and unparalleled prosperity of the colony demonstrates, that but slight callses
of complaint existed. That which produced the greatest
and most constant irritation was the refusal, by the deputy
governors, to assent to any law imposing taxes on the
lands of the proprietors, although the sum raised was to
be expended for the benefit of the whole province. TI'his
unwise, and indeed unjust, claim of exemption, occasioned
greater disgust than injury, and embittered all the enjoyments of the inhabitants.
14. But these dissensions did not, in the least, retard the
prosperity of the colony. Nor did any other cause, having
that tendency, exist. The upright conduct of Penn, in
his intercourse with the Indians, was imitated by those
who came after him; and, for seventy years, uninterrupted
harmony existed between them and the whites. In the
early part of the revolutionary war, the people adopted a
new constitution, by which the proprietor was excluded
from all share in the government. He was offered, and
finally accepted, the sumn of 570,000 dollars, in dischargo
of all quit-rents due from the inhabitants.
92CHAPTER X.
MARYLAND.
DURING the reign of James I, the laws against Roman Catholics were sev&amp;re and the popular hatred was
inveterate. Lord Baltimore, a distinguished member of
that sect, resolved, in consequence, to remnove from England to Virginia, believing that he might there enjoy his
religious opinions, without violating the laws or incurring
reproach. But the people among whomn he came to reside,
were almost as intolerant as those he had left, and he
soon found it necessary to seekl some other asylum.
2. Having ascerta'ned that the territory on both sides
of Chesapeake bay, was inhabited only by the natives, he
conceived the project of planting there a colony for himself,
and for all who might wish to retire from religious persecution. He explored the country, returned to England, obtained the assent of king Charles I to a grant of territory,
but died before the requisite formalities were completed.
3. Cecil, his eldest son, and heir to his estate and title,
obtaitned for himself the grant intended for his father.'To
the new colony the name of Maryland was given, in honor
of Henrietta Maria, the royal consort of Charles. TI'he
lalld conveyed being witnin the boundaries of Virginia, the
planters in that province remonstrated against the grant.
The king refuising to rescind it, lord Baltimore made
preparations to commence a settlement. lie appointed
his brother, Leonard Calvert, governor; who, near the
close of the year 1633, sailed for America, accompanied
by about two hundred emigrants, mostly Roman Catholics
4. They arrived in February, 1634, at the mouth of the
river Potomac. At a conference with the Indians who
dwelt on the shore, they purchased Yoamaco, a conrsiderable
village, the site of which St. Mary's now occupies. By
this measure, wise as well as just, the rightful proprietors
of the soil were satisfied, convenient habitations and some
cultivated land were obtained, and the first settlers were
of couirse exempted from the miseries of famine, and from
the diseases which it produces.
5. Othler circumstances favored the rapid population of
the colony. The charter granted more ample privileges
than hlad ever been conceded to a subject; the country
was inviting; the natives were friendly; from the southchurchmen drove puritans, from the north puritans drove
churchmen, into her borders, where all were freely received,
protected, and cherished.
6. The charter granted to the inhabitants the privilege
of passing laws either by themselves or representatives,
without reserving to the crown, as had been done in all
previous charters, the right to reject the laws so passed.
At first, when the freemen were few in number, each
attended in person, or authorized some other freeman, who
chose to atternd, to vote and act in his stead. The increase
of population soon rendered it necessary to adopt a different mode of legislation. In 1639, an act was passed,
coins'ituting a "holuse of assembly," to be composed of such
as should be chosen by the people, of such as should be
summoned or appointed by the proprietor, and of the governor and secretary. These were to sit together, and the
laws which they should enact were to possess the same
validity, as though the proprietors and all the people
had conlcurred in enacting thiOm.
7. Irn 1650, a second alteration was made. The legislative body was divided into two branches, the delegates
chosen by the people constituting the lower house, and the
persons summoned by the proprietors, the upp)er house. It
ought to be stated, for the honor of lord Baltimore and
his associatec, that, while the catholics retained the
ascendency in the province, the assembly passed no law
abridging the liberty of conscience.
8. But this colony, as well as all the others, in the early
period of their existence, was afflicted with intestine
troubles. They were principally caused by one Williamn
Clayborne. While a member of the Virginia council he
had obtained a license from the king, to traffic in those
parts of America where no other person enjoyedthe exclusive right of trade. Under this license, he had niade a
small settlement on the island of Kent, and, when the
grant was made to lord Baltimore, refused to submit to his
authority.  He persuaded the natives that the "new
comers" were Spaniards, and enemies to the Virginians.
An Indian war was the consequence, which continued
several years, and-was productive of considerable distress.
9. Clayborne was indicted and convicted of murder,
piracy, and sedition; and fleeing from justice, his estate
was confiscated. He applied to the king for redress, but
after a full hearing, was dismissed without obtaining any
order in his favor. When the civil war, between the king
MARYLAND.
940MARYLA-ND.                  9
and parliament, began, he embraced the cause of the latter,
returned to Maryland, and, by his intrigues fomented, in
1645, a rebellion against its rulers, who were attached to
the royal cause. Calvert, the governor, was compelled to
fly to Virginia, and the insurgents seized the reins of
government. The next year, however, the revolt was
suppressed and tranquillity restored.
10. But after the parliament had triumphed over the
king, they appointed commissioners for "reducing and
governing the colonies within the bay of Chesapeake."
An.ong these was Clayborne, the evil genius of Maryland.
The proprietor, consenting to acknowledge the authority
of parliament, was permitted to retain his station, but was
unable to preserve tranquillity. The distractions of England, finding their way into the colony, occasioned a civil
war, which ended in the discomfiture of the governor and
Roman Catholics.
11. The next assemnbly, which was entirely under the
influence of the victorious party, ordained that persons
professing the Catholic religion should not be considered
within the protection of the laws.  Thus were they
ungratefilly persecuted by men whom they had taken to
their bosom, and in a colony which they had founded.
Laws unfavorable to the Quakers were also enacted, and
here, as in England, the upper heuse was voted to be
useless. At the restoration, in 1660, Philip Calvert was
appointed governor, and the ancient order of things restored.
The colony then contained about twelve thousand inhabitants.
12. In 1676, died Cecil, lord Baltimore, the father of
the province. For more than forty years, he had directed
its affairs as proprietor, and displayed, in all his conduct,
a benevolent heart and enlightened understanding. Although he lived in an age of bigotry, he was liberal in his
opinions; and for all his exertions to contribute to the
happiness of his fellow beings, he desired no reward but
their gratitude. This reward he received. The records
of the Maryland assembly contain frequent memorials of
the respect and affection of the people. He was succeeded,
as proprietor, by his eldest son, Charles, who had, for
several years, been governor of the colony, and displayed
the same amiable qualities which had rendered his father
respected and beloved.
13. In the year 1689, the epoch of the revolution in
England, the repose of Maryland was again disturbed. A

rumor was artfully circulated, that the Catho(ilics had
leagued with the Indians to destroy all the Protestants in
the province. An armed association was immediately
formed, for the defence of the Protestant religion, and for
asserting the. rights of king William and queen Mary.
The magistrates attempted to oppose by force this association; but, meeting with few supporters, were compelled
to abdicate the government.
14. King William directed those who had assumed the
supreme authority to exercise it in his name; and for
twenty-seven years the crown retained the entire control
of thle province. In 1716, the proprietor was restored to
his rights; and he and his descendants continued to enjoy
them until the commencement of the revolution. The
people then assumed the government, adopted a constitution, and refused to admit the claims of lord Baltimore to
iurisdiction or property.
CiIAPTER XI.
NORTH-CAROLINA.
IN 1630, Charles I granted to Sir Robert Heath all the
territory between the 30th and 36th degrees of north
latitude, and extending from the Atlantic ocean to the
South sea, by the nafie of Carolina. Under this grant, no
settlement was made. Between 1640 and 1650, persons
suffering from religious intolerance in Virginia, fled beyond
her limits, and, without license from any source, occupied
that portion of North-Carolinia, north of Albemarle sound.
They found the winters mild and the soil fertile. As their
cattle and swine procured their own support in the woods
and multiplied fast, they were enabled, with little labor,
to live in the enjoyment of abundance. Tlheir number
was annually augmented; they acknowledged no superior
upon earth, and obeyed no laws but those of God and nature.
WIn 1661, another settlement was made, near the
mouth of Clarendon river, by adventurers from Massachusets. The land being sterile and the Indians hostile,
they, in 1663, abandoned it. Immediately afterwards,
their place was supplied by emigrants from Barbadoes, who
invested Sir John Yeomans with the authority of governor.
3. Sir Robert Heath having neglected to co4ply with
96the conditions of, his patent, the king, in 1663, granted
the samine territory to lord Clarendon and seven others,
and invested them with ample powers of government over
those who should inhabit it. To encourage emigration,
they gave public assurances, that all who might remove to
their territory, should enjoy unrestricted religious liberty,
and be governed by a free assembly. The settlers on
Albemarle sound were, on certain conditions, allowed to
retain their lands. A government over them was organized,
at the head of which a MAr. Drummond was placed. With
the regulations imposed, they were dissatisfied, and revolted; but their grievances were redressed, and) in 1668,
they returned to their duty.
4. At the request of the proprietors, the celebrated
John Locke, whose political writings were then much
read and admiredl, prepared for the colony a constitution
of government. It provided that a chief officer, to be
called the palatine and to hold his office during life, should
l)e elected from among the proprietors; that a hereditary
nobility, to be calledlandgraves and caziques, should be
created; and that, once in two years, representatives
should be chosenr by the freeholders. All these, with the
proprietors or their deputies, were to meet in one assembly,
which was to be called the parliament, and over which
tle palatine was to preside. The parliament could deliberate and decide only upon such propositions as should
be laid before it by a grand couniicil composed of the
palatine, nobility, and deputies of the proprietors.
5. This constitution, hiowever wise it might seem to
EVnglish politicians, was not adapted to the sentiments
and habits of the people for whom it was prepared. Its
aristocratic leatures displeased them.  The measures
adopted to introduce and enforce it, produced, in connection
with other causes, an insurrection, in the progress of
which the palatine, and the deputies were seized and
imprisoned. Application was made to Virginia for as...
sistance i-r restoring order; but the fear of punishment
induced the insurgents to submit, before an armed force
could be arrayed against them.
6. In 1670, William Sayle, under the direction of the
roprietors, made a settlement at Port Royal, within the
limits of South-Carolina. The-next year, dissatisfied with
this station, he removed his colony northward, to a neck
of land between Ashley and Cooper rivers, where lie laid
out a town, which, in honour of the king then reigning,

lie called Charleston. Dying soon after, Sir John Yeo.
mans, who had, for several years,: been governlor at
Clarendon, was appointed to succeed him.  This new
settlement attracted at first maiy inhabitants from that at
Clarendon, and at lentgth entirely exhausted it. Being
remnote romn Albemarle, the proprietors established a
separate government over it, and henrce arose the distineti ve appellations of North and Southl-Carolina.
7. I'he prosperity of the northern colony was retarded
i)y donmesti( dissensions. To allay them, Seth Sothel,,nie o-f thle proprietors, was appointed chief magistrate.
H-lis conduct, far from restoring quiet and contentment,
inereased tile disorders which had before prevailed. He
is represented as the most corrupt and rapacious of
coloniial governors. Hle plundered the innocent and received bribes fromr felons. For six years, the inhabitants
eildLired his injustice and oppression. They then seized
him, with a view of sending him to England for trial. At
his request, he was detained and tried by the assembly,
who banished him firom the colony.
8. His successor was Philip Ladwell, of Virginia, and
t'o himn succeeded John Archdale, who was a quaker and
one of the proprietors.  Both were popular governors;
under their administration, the colony prospered and the
people were happy. In 1693, at the request of the Carolinians, the constitution of Locke was abrogated by the
proprietors, and each colony was afterwards ruled by a
governor, council, and house of representatives.:
9. In 1707, a company of French protestanrts arrived
and seated themselves on the river Trent, a branch of the
Neuse, in 1710, a large number of Palatines, fleeing from
religious persecution in Germany, sought refuge in the
same part ot the province. To each of these, the proprietors granted one, hundred acres of land. They lived
appy, for a few years, in the enjoyment of liberty of
conscience, and in the prospect of competence and ease.
10. But suddenly a terrible calamity fell upon them.
The Tuscarora and Coree Indians, smarting under recent
injuries, and dreading total extinction from the encroachment of these strangers, plotted, Withl characteristic
secrecy, their entire destruction. Sending their families
to one of their fortified towns, twelve hundred bowmen
sallied forth, and, in the same night, attacked, in separate
parties, the nearest settlements of the Palatines. Men,
women, and children were indiscriminately butchered.

The savages, with the swiftness and ferocity of wolves.
ran from village to village. Before tliem, was the repose
of innocence; behind, the sleep of death. A few, escaping,
alarmed the settlements more remote, and hastened to
South-Carolina for assistance.
11. Governor Craven immediately despatched, to the
aid of the sister colony, nearly a thousand men, under the
coiymmand of colonel Barnwell. After a fatiguing march
through a hideous wildernress, they met the enemy, attacked, defeated, and pursued themn to their fortified town,
which was immediately besieged. In a few days, peace,
at their solicitation, was concluded, and colonel Barnwell
returned to South-Carolina.
112. The peace was short, and upon the recommencement of hostilities, assistance was again solicited from the
southern colony. Colonel Jarmes Moore, an active young
officer, was imme(liately despatched, with forty white
men and eight hundred friendly Inrdians. - Hle fot,nd the
enemny in a fort near Cotechny river. After a siege, which
continued more than a week, the fort was taken and eight
hundred Indians made prisoners. T'rhe Tuscaroras, disheartened by this defeat, migrated, in 1713, to the north,
aiid joined the celebrated confederacy, denominated the
Five Nations. The others sued for peace, and afterwards
continued friendly.
13. Until 1729, the two Carolinas, though distinct for
mnany purposes, remained under the superintendence and
conitrol of the sante proprietors. Neither had been prosperous; anid the interests of the governors and governed
being apparently adverse to each other, the latter became
discontented and refractory.  They complained to the
king, who directed inquiry to be made in hiscourts. The
charter which he had granted was declared forfeited, and
over each co6lony, royal government.s, entirely unconnected
with each other, were established.
14. Soonafter this event, the soil in the interior of
North-Carolina was found to be superior in fertility to
that on the sea-coast. The settlements, consequently,
advanced rapidly into the wilderness. From the northern
colonies, particularly Pennsylvania, multitudes were allured to this region by the mildness of the climate, and by
the facility of obtaininlg in abundance all the neccessaries
of life. At peace with the Indians, and fortunate in her
governors, the colony continued to prosper until the corniwnuement of the troubles which preceeded therevolutiom-.
