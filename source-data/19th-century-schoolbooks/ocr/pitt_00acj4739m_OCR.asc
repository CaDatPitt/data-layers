CONTENTS.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
firmn in this youthful land, than where she treads the sequestered glens of Scotland, or couches herself among the magnificent mountains of Switzerland. Arbitrary principles,
like those against which we now contend, have cost one
king of England his life, another his crown--and they may
yet cost a third his most flourishing colonies.
We are two millions-one fifth figolting men. We are
bold and vigorous--and we call no man master.'ro the
nation from whom we are proud to derive our origin, we
ever were, and we ever will be, ready to yield unforced
assistance; but it most not, and it never can be extorted.
Some have sneeringly asked, "Are the Americans too
poor to pay a few pounds on stamped paper?" No! America, thanks to God and herself, is rich. But the right to
take ten pounds implies the right to take a thousand; and
what must be the wealth that avarice, aided by power,
cannot exhaust? True, the spectre is now small; but the
shadow he casts before him is huge enough to darken all
this fair land.
Others, in sentimental style, talk of the immense debt
of gratitude which we owe to Englandl. And what is the
amount of this debt? Why, truly, it is the same that the
young lion owes to the dam, which has brought it forth on
the solitude of the mountain, or left it amid the winds an(d
storms of the desert.
We plunged into the wave, with the great charter of freedom in our teeth, because the fagot and torch were behind
us. We have walked this new world from its savage
lethargy; forests -have been prostrated in our path; towns
and cities have grown up suddenly as the flowers of the
tropics, and the fires in our autumnal woods are scarcely
more rapid than the increase of our wealth and population.
And do we owe all this to the kind succour of the mother
country? No! we owe it to the tyranny that drove us
from her,-to the pelting storms which invigorated our
helpless infancy.
But perhaps others will say, "4 We ask no money from
your gratitude,--we only demand that you should pay your
own expenses." And who, I pray, is to judge of their
necessity?  Why, the king-(and with all due reverence
to his sacred majesty, he understands the real wants of his.distant subjects as little as he does the language of the
98OTIS-IIOPKINSON..
Choctaws.)  Who is to judlge concerning the frequency of
these demands? The ministry. Who is to judge whetlher
the money is properly expended? The cabinet behind the
throne.
In every instance, those who take are to judge for those
who pay: if this system is suffered to go into operation,
we shall have reason to esteem it a great privilege that rain
and dew do not depend upon parliament; otherwise they
would soon be taxed and dried.
But thanks to God, there is freedom enough left upon
earth to resist such monstrous injustice. The flame of
liberty is extinguished in Greece and Rome, but the light
of its glowing embers is still bright and strong on the sliores
of America.  Actuated by its sacred influence, we will
resist unto death. But we will not countenalnce anarchy
and misrule. The wrongs that a desperate community have
heaped ulpon their enemies, shall be amply and speedily
repaired. Still, it may be well for some proud men to
remember, that a fire is lighted in these colonies, which one
breath of their king may kindle into such fury that the blood
of all England cannot extinguish it.        OTIs.
19.-VINDICATION OF SPAIN. (PRONOUNCED DURING THE
DEBATE ON THE SEMINOLE WAR, IN CONGRESS, 1819.)
PERMIT me, sir, to express my regret and decided disapprobation of the terms of reproach and contempt in which
this nation has been spoken of on this floor; I"poor, degraded Spain," has resounded from various parts of the
house. Is it becoming, sir, the dignity of a representative
of the American people to utter, from his high station,
invectives against a nation with whom we cultivate and
maintain the most friendly relations? Is it (liscreet, sir, in
an individual, however enlightened, to venture upon a
denunciation of a whole people?
In this poor, degraded Spain, it must be remembered,
there is a vast mass of learning, and genius, and virtue, too;
and a gentleman, who passes it all under his condemnation
and contempt, hardly considers what a task he has undertaken.  No people has suffered more than ourselves by
t.hese exterminntino. sweening iudrrments. Let us not beTHE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
guilty of the same injustice to others. When I see one of
these scribbling travellers, or insignificant atoms, gravely
take upon himself to put down the character of my own
country, I turn from him with disgust and derision.
Let us be equally just to others. This at least is not the
place for the indulgence of national prejudices or resentments. A regard for ourselves forbids it. May I add, sir,
that, in reference to the weakness of Spain, we should
characterize her, perhaps more justly, certainly more liberally, by saying exhausted, rather than degraded Spain.
Yes, sir, exhausted in a contest for existence with a tremendous power, under which every other nation of Europe,
save one, sunik and fell. She bore herself through with
inflexible perseverance; and, if she came out of the conflict
enfeebled and exhausted, it is no cause of reproach or
contempt.
We talk of a war with Spain as a matter of amusement. I do not desire to partake of it. It will not be found
a very comfortable war, not from her power to do so much
harm, but from the impossibility of gaining any thing by
it, or of wearing out her patience, or subduing her fortitude.
The history of every Spanish war, is a history of immovable obstinacy, that seems to be confirmed and hardened by
misfortune and trial. In her frequent contests with Eng
land, the latter, after all her victories, has been the first to
desire peace.
Let gentlemen not deceive themselves about the plea
santry of a Spanish war. May they not, sir, have some
respect for the past character of this nation? The time has
been, when a Spanish knight was the type of every thing
that was chivalrous in valour, generous in honour, and pure
in patriotism. A century has hardly gone by, since the
Spanish infantry was the terror of Europe, and the pride of
soldiers. But those days of her glory are past. Where,
now, is that invincible courage; that noble devotion to
honour; that exalted love of country? Let me tell you,
in a voice of warning; they are buried in the mines of
Mexico, and the mountains of Peru. Beware, my countrymen; look not with so eager an eye to these fatal possessions, which will also be the grave of your strength and
virtue, should you be so unfortunate as to obtain them.
HOPKINSON.
10020.--CLOSE OF AN ORATION ON THE DEATH OF JOIIN ADAMS
AND THOMAS JEFFERSON.
GREAT are their namies! Hionoured and revered be their
memory! Associated with Washington and Franklin, their
glory is a precious possession, enriching our annals, and
exalting the character of our country.
Greater is the bright example they have left us! More
precious tile lesson, furnished by their lives, for our instruction. At this affecting moment, then, when we are
assembled to pay the last tribute of respect, let us seriously
meditate upon our duties; let us consider, earnestly and
anxiously consider, how we shall best preserve those signal
blessings, which have been transmitted to us,-how  we
shall transmit them unimpaired to our posterity.
This is the honour which would have been most acceptable to these illustrious men. This is an appropriate mode
of commemorating the event we this day mourn. Let the
truths of the declaration of independence, the principles
of the revolution, the principles of free government, sink
deep into our hearts, and govern all our conduct.
National independence has been achieved once and for
ever. It can never be endangered. Time has accumulated
strength with a rapidity unexampled. The thirteen colonies, almost without an union, few in numbers, feeble in
means, are become in a lapse of fifty years, a nation of
twenty-four states, bound together by a common government of their own choice, with a territory doubled by
peaceful acquisition, with ten niillions of inhabitants, with
commerce extending to every quarter of the world, and
resources equal to every emergency of war or peace.
Institutions of humanity, of science, and of literature, have
been established throughout the land. Temples have arisen
to Him, who created all things, and by whom all things are
sustained, not by the commands of princes or rulers, n
by legal coercion, but from the spontaneous offerings of the
human heart. Conscience is absolutely free in the broadest
and most unqualified sense. Industry is free; and human
action knows no greater control than is indispensable to
the preservation of rational liberty.
What is our duty? To understand, and to appreciate
the value of these signal blessings, and with all our might

and strength, to endeavour to perpetuate them. To take
care that the great soiirces, from which they flow, be not
obstructed by selfish passion, nor polluted by lawless
ambition, nor destroyed by intemperate violence.
To rise to the full perception of the great truth; "that
governments are instituted among men to secuire human
rights, deriving their authority from the consent of the
governed," and that with a knowledge of our own rights,
must be united the same just regard for the rights of others,
and pure affection for our country, which dwelt in the
hearts of the fathers of the revolution.
In concluision, allow me to remind you, that with all their
doings was mingled a spirit of unaffected piety.-In adversity they humbled themselves before Him, whose power is
almighty and whose goodness is infinite. In prosperity
they gave Him the thanks. In His aid, invoked upon their
arms and counsels with sincerity of heart, was their reliance
and hope.
Let us all be thankful for the mercies which, as a nation,
we have so largely experienced, and as often as we gratefully remember those illustrious men, to whom we are indebted, let us not forget that their efforts must have been
inavailing, and that our hopes are vain, unless approved by
Him; and in humble reliance upon His favour, let us im
plore His continued blessing upon our beloved country.
J. SERGEANT
21.-GREAT EFFECTS RESULT FROM LITTLE CAUSES.
THE same connexion between small things and great runs
through all the concerns of our world. The ignorance of a
physician, or the carelessness of an apothecary, may spread
death through a family or a town. How often has the sickness of one man, become the sickness of thousands? How
often has the error of one man, become the error of thousands?
A fly, or an atom, may set in motion a train of intermediate
causes, which shall produce a revolution in a kingdom. Any
one of a thousand incidents, might have cut off Alexander
of Greece in his cradle. But if Alexander had died in
infancy, or had lived a single day longer than he did, it
might have put anotlher face on all the following history of
- world.
102A spectacle-maker's boy, amusing himself in his father's
shop, by holding two glasses between his finger and his
thlumb, and varying their distance, perceived the weathercock of the church spire, opposite to him, much larger than
ordinary, and apparently much nearer, and turned upsi(le
down. This excited the wonder of the father, and led him
to additional experiments; and these resulted in that astonishing instrument, the telescope, as invented by Galileo,
and perfected by Herschell.
On the same optical principles was constructed the microscope, by which we perceive that a drop of stagnant water
is a world teeming with inhabitants. By one of these
instruments, the experimental philosopher measures the
ponderous globes, that the Omnipotent Hand has ranged in
majestic order through the skies; by the other, he sees
the same hand employed in rounding and polishing five
thousand minute transparent globes in the eye of a fly.
Yet all these discoveries of modern science, exhibiting the
intelligence, dominion, and agency of God, we owe to the
transient amusement of a child.
It is a-fact commonly known, that the laws of gravitation, which guide the thousands of rolling worlds in the
planetary system, were suggested at first to the mind of
Newton by the falling of an apple.
The art of printiing shows from what casual incidents
the most magnificent events in the scheme of Providence
may result. Time was, when princes were scarcely rich
enough to purchase a copy of the Bible. Now every cottager in Christendom is rich enough to possess this treasure.
"Who would have thought, that the simple circumstance
of a man, amusing himself by cutting a few letters on the
bark of a tree, and impressing them on paper, was intimately connected with the mental illumination of the
world!"                                      PORTER.
22.-THE GRAVE OF THE INDIAN CHIEF.
THEY laid the corse of the wild and brave
On the sweet fresh earth of the new day grave,
On the gentle hill, where wild weeds waved,
And flowers and grass were flourishing.
103
PORTER-PERCIVAL.TIHE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
They laid within the peaceful bed,
Close by the Indian chieftain's head,
His bow and arrows; and they said,
That he had found new hunting grounds;
Where bounteous nature only tills
The willing soil; and o'er whose hills,
And down beside the shady rills,
The hero roams eternally.
And these fair isles to the westward lie,
Beneath a golden sunset sky,
Where youth and beauty never die,
And song and dance move endlessly.
They told of the feats of his dog and gun,
They told of the deeds his arm had done;
They sung of battles lost and won,
And so they paid his eulogy.
And o'er his arms, and o'er his bones,
They raised a simple pile of stones;
Which, hallow'd by their tears and moans,
Was all the Indian's monument.
And since the chieftain here has slept,
Full many a winter's winds have swept,
And many an age has softly crept
Over his humble sepulchre.       PERCIVAL
23.-TO THE EAGLE.
BIRD of the broad and sweeping wing!
Thy home is high in heaven,
Where wide the storms their banners fling,
And the tempest clouds are driven.
Thy throne is on the mountain top;
Thy fields--the boundless air;
And hoary peaks, that proudly prop
The skies-thy dwellings are.
Thou sittest like a thing of light,
Amid the noontide blaze:
The midway sun is clear and brightIt cannot dim thy gaze.
104PERCIVAL.
Thy pinions, to the rushing blast
O'er the bursting billow spread,
Where the vessel plunges, hurry past,
Like an angel of the dead.
Thou art perch'd aloft on the beetling crag,
And the waves are white below,
And on, with a haste that cannot lag,
They rush in an endless flow.
Again, thou hast plumed thy wing for flight
To lands beyond the sea,
And away like a spirit wreath'd in light,
Thou hurriest wild and free.
Thou hurriest o'er the myriad waves,
And thou leavest them all behind;
Thou sweepest that place of unknown graves,
Fleet as the tempest wind.
When the night storm gathers dim and dark,
With a shrill and boding scream,
Thou rushest by the foundering bark,
Quick as a passing dream.
Lord of the boundless realm of air!
In thy imperial name,
The hearts of the bold and ardent dare
The dangerous path of fame.
Beneath the shade of thy golden wings,
The Roman legions bore,
From the river of Egypt's cloudy springs,
Their pride, to the polar shore.
For thee they fought, for thee they fell,
And their oath was on thee laid;
To thee the clarions raised their swell,
And the dying warrior pray'd.
Thou wert, through an age of death and fears,
The image of pride and power,
Till the gather'd rage of a thousand years
Burst forth in one awful hour.
And then, a deluge of wrath it came,
And..the nations shook with dread;
105THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
And it swept the earth till its fields were flame,
And piled with the mingled dead.
Kings were roll'd in the wasteful flood,
With the low and crouching slave;
And together lay, in a shroud of blood,
The coward and the brave.
And where was then thy fearless flight?
"' O'er the dark mysterious sea,
To the lands that caught the setting light,
The cradle of ILiberty.
There, on the silent and lonely shore,
For ages I watch'd alone,
And the world, in its darkiiess, ask'd no more
Where the glorious bird had flown.
"But then came a bold and hardy few,
And they breasted the unknown wave;
I caught afar the wandering crew;
And I knew they were high and brave.
I wheel'd around the welcome bark,
As it sought the desolate shore;
And up to heaven, like a joyous lari,
My quivering pinions bore.
"And now that bold and hardy few
Are a nation wide and strong,
And danger and doubt I have led them through,
And they worship me in song;
And over their bright and glancing arms
On field and lake and sea,
With an eye that fires, and a spell that charms,
I guide them to victory."            PERCIVAL.
24.- HYMN OF THE MORAVIAN NUNS AT THE CONSECRATION
OF PULASKI'S BANNER.
[The standard of Count Pulaski, the noble Pole who fell in the attack
upon Savannahl, during the American revolution, was of crimson silk,
eminbroidered by the Moravian Nuns of Bethlehem, in Pennsylvania.]
WHEN the dying flame of day
Through the chancel shot its ray,
Far the glimmering tapers shed
Faint light on the cowled head,
106And the censer burning swung,
Where before the altar hung
That proud banner, which with prayer
Had been consecrated there.
And the nuns' sweet 1-iymn was heard the while
Sung low in the dim mysterious aisle.
Take thy banner!-may it wave
Proudly o'er the good and brave,
When the battle's distant wail
Breaks the sabbath of our vale,When the clarion's music thrills
To the hearts of these lone hills,When the spear in conflict shakes,
And the strong lance shivering breaks.
Take thy banner!--and beneath
The war-cloud's encircling wreath,
Guard it-till our homes are freeGuard it-God will prosper thee!
In the dark and trying hour,
In the breaking forth of power,
In the rush of steeds and men,
His right hand will shield thee then.
Take thy banner! But when night
Closes round the ghastly fight,
If the vanquish'd warrior bow,
Spare him!-by our holy vow,
By our prayers and many tears,
By the mercy that endears,
Spare him--he our love hath sharedSpare him-as thou wouldst be spared
Take thy banner!-and if e'er
Thou shouldst press the soldier's bier,
And the muffled drum should beat
To the tread of mournful feet,
Then this crimson flag shall be
Martial cloak and shroud for thee!
And the warrior took that banner proud,
And it was his martial cloak and shroud.

25.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF G. MORRIS, IN CONGRESS,
ON THE NAVIGATION OF THE MISSISSIPPI.
MR. PRESIDENT,-My object is peace. I could assign
many reasons to show that this declaration is sincere. But
can it be necessary to give this senate any other assurance
than my word? Notwithstanding the acerbity of temper
which results from party strife, gentlemen will believe me
on my word. I will not pretend, like my honourable colleague, to describe to you the waste, the ravages, and the
horrors of war. I have not the same harmonious periods,
nor the same musical tones; neither shall I boast of Christian charity, nor attempt to display that ingenuous glow of
benevolence, so decorous to the cheek of youthi, which
gave a vivid tint to every sentence he uttered; and was, if
possible, as impressive even as his eloquence. But though
we possess not the same pomp of words, our hearts are not
insensible to the woes of humanity. We can feel for the
misery of plundered towns, the conflagration of defenceless villages, and the devastation of cultured fields.
Turning from these features of general distress, we call
enter the abodes of private affliction, and behold the widow
weeping, as she traces, in the pledges of connubial affection, the resemblance of him whom she has lost for ever.
We see the aged matron bending over the ashes of her son.
He was her darling; for he was generous and brave; and
therefore his spirit led him to the field in defence of his
country. We can observe another oppressed with unutterable anguish; condemned to conceal her affection;
forced to hide that passion, which is at, once the torment
and delight of life: she learns that those eyes, which
beamed with sentiment, are closed in death; and his lip,
the ruby harbinger of joy, lies pale and cold, the miserable
appendage of a mangled corpse. Hard, hard indeed, must
be that heart, which can be insensible to scenes like these;
and bold the man who dare present to the Almighty Father
a conscience crimsoned with the blood of his children!
Sir, I wish for peace; I wish the negotiation may succeed, and therefore I strongly urge you to adopt these resolutions. But though you should adopt them, they alone
will not ensure success. I have no hesitation in saying,
that you ought to have taken possession of New Orleans
1,08and the Floridas, the instant your treaty was violated.
You ought to do it now. Your rights are invaded, confidence in negotiation is vain: there is, therefore, no alternative but force. You are exposed to imminent present danger: you have the prospect of great filture advantage: you
are justified by the clearest principles of right: you are
urged by the strongest motives of policy: you are commanded by every sentiment of national dignity.
Look at the conduct of America in her infant years.
When there was no actual invasion of right, but only a
claim to invade, she resisted the claim; she spurned the
insult. Did we then hesitate? Did we then wait for
foreign alliance? No--animated with the spirit, warmed
with the soul of freedom, we threw our oaths of allegiance
in the face of our sovereign, and committed our fortunes
and our fate to the God of battles. We then were subjects. We had not then attained to the dignity of an independent republic. We then had no rank among the nations
of the earth. But we had the spirit which deserved that
elevated station. And now that we have gained it, shall
we fall from our honour?
Sir, I repeat to you that I wish for peace; real, lasting,
honourable peace. To obtain, and secure this blessing, let
us, by a bold and decisive conduct, convince the powers
of Europe that we are determined to defend our rights;
that we will not submit to insult; that we will not bear
degradation. This is the conduct which becomes a generous people. This conduct will command the respect of
the world. Nay, sir, it may rouse all Europe to a proper
sense of their situation. They see that the balance of
power, on which their liberties depend, is, if not destroyed,
in extreme danger.. They know that the dominion of
France has been extended by the sword over millions who
groan in the servitude of their new masters.  These
unwilling subjects are ripe for revolt.
The empire of the Gauls is not, like that of Rome, secured by political institutions. It may yet be broken. But
whatever may be the conduct of others, let us act as becomes ourselves. I cannot believe, with my honourable
colleague, that three-fourths of America are opposed to
vigorous measures. I cannot believe that they will meanly

109THE AMER1CAN SPEAKER.
refuse to pay the sums needful to vindicate their honour an
support their independence.
Sir, this is a libel on the people of America. They will
disdain submission to the proudest sovereign on earth.
They have not lost the spirit of'76. But, sir, if they are
so base as to barter their rights for gold, if they are so vile
that they will not defend their honour, they are unworthy
of the rank they enjoy, and it is no matter how soon they
are parcelled out among better masters.
My honourable friend from Pennsylvania, in opening this
debate, pledged himself and his friends to support the executive government, if they would adoDt a manly conduct.
I have no hesitation to renew that pledge. Act as becomes
America, and all America will be united in your support.
What is our conduot? Do we endeavour to fetter and
trammel the executive authority? Do we oppose obstacles? Do we raise diffiulties? No. We are willing to
commit into the hands of the chief magistrate the treasure,
the power, and the energies of the country.  We ask for
ourselves nothing. We expect nothing. All we ask is
for our country. And although we do not believe in the
success of treaty, yet the 1'esolutions we move, and the
language we hold, are calculated to promote it.  MORRIS.
26.-GEN. WASHINGTON TO HIS TROOPS, (DELIVERED BEFORE
THE BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND, 1776.)
THE time is now near at hand, which must probably
determine whether Americans are to be freemen or slaves;
whether they are to have any property they can call their
own; whether their houses and farms are to be pillaged and
destroyed, and themselves consigned to a state of wretchedness, from which no human efforts will deliver thenl. The
fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the
courage and conduct of this army. Our cruel and unrelenting enemy leaves us only the choice of a brave resistance, or the most abject submission. We have, therefore,
to resolve to conquer or to die.
Our own, our country's honour, calls upon us for a vigorous and manly exertion; and if we now shamefully fail,
we shall become infamous to the whole world. Let us
1.10then rely on the goodness of our cause, and the aid of the
Supreme Being, in whose hands victory is, to animate and
encourage us to great and noble actions. The eyes of all
our countrymen are now upon us, and we shall have their
blessings and praises, if happily we are the instruments of
saving them from the tyranny meditated against them.
Let us therefore animate and encourage each other, and
show the whole world, that a freeman contending for liberty
on his own ground, is superior to any slavish mercenary
on earth.
Liberty, property, life, and honour are all at stake; upon
your courage and conduct, rest the hopes of our bleeding
and insulted country; our wives, children, and parents
expect safety from us only; anld they have every reason
to believe, that Heaven will crown'with success so just a
cause.
The enemy will endeavour to intimidate by show and
appearance; but remember, they have been repulsed on
various occasions by a few brave Americans. Their cause
is bad--their men are conscious of it; and, if opposed
with firmness and coolness on their first onset, with our
advantage of works, and knowledge of the ground, the
victory is most assuredly ours. Every good soldier will
be silent and attentive-wait for orders-and reserve his
fire until he is sure of doing execution.  WASHINGTON.
27.--EXTRACT FROM THE ADDRESS OF THE AMERICAN CONGRESS TO THE INHABITANTS OF GREAT BRITAIN, 1775.
OUR enemies charge us with sedition. In what does
it consist? In our refusal to submit to unwarrantable
acts of injulstice and cruelty?  If so, show us a period
in your history, in which you have not been equally seditious.
We are accused of aiming at independence. But how
is this accusation supported? By the allegations of your
ministers; not by our actions. Abused, insulted, and contemned, what steps have we pursued to obtaini redress?
We have carried our dutiful petitions to the throne. We
have applied to your justice for relief. We have retrenched
our luxury, and withheld our trade.
The advantages of our commerce were designed as a
111
WASHINGTON,THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
compensation for your protection. When you ceased to
protect, for what were we to, compensate?
What has been the success of our endeavours? The
clemency of our sovereign is unhappily diverted; our petitions are treated with indignity; our prayers answered by
insults. Our application to you remains unnoticed, and
leaves us the melancholy apprehension of your wanting
either the will or the power to assist us.
Even under these circumstances, what measures have
we talien that betray a desire of independence? Have we
called in the aid of those foreign powers who are the rivals
of your grandeur? When your troops were few and defenceless, did we take advantage of their distress and expel
them our towns? Or have we permitted them to fortify,
to receive new aid, and to acquire additional strength?
Let not your enemies and ours persuade you, that in
this we were influenced by fear, or any other unworthy
motive. The lives of Britons are still dear to us. They
are the children of our parents, and an uninterrupted
intercourse of mutual benefits had knit the bonds of
friendship. When hostilities were commenced, when, on
a late occasion, we were wantonly attacked by your
troops, though we repelled their assaults and returned
their blows, yet we lamented the wounds they obliged us
to give; nor have we yet learned to rejoice at a victory
over Englishmen.
Let us now ask what advantages are to attend our reduction? The trade of a ruined and desolate country is always inconsiderable--its revenue trifling; the expense of
subjecting and retaining it in subjection, certain and inevitable. What then remains but the gratification of an illjudged pride, or the hope of rendering us subservient to
designs on your liberty?
Soldiers, who have sheathed their swords in the bowels
of their American brethren, will not draw them with
more reluctance against you. When too late you may
lament the loss of that freedom, which we exhort you,
while still in your power, to preserve.
On the other hand, should you prove unsuccessful~
should that connexion which we most ardently wish to
maintain, be dissolved; should your ministers exhaust your
treasures and waste the blood of your countrymen, in vain
112attempts on our liberty; do they not deliver you, weak and
defenceless, to your natural enemies?
Since, then, your liberty must be the price of your victories; your ruin, of your defeat; what blind fatality can urge
you to a pursuit destructive of all that Britons hold dear?
If you have no regard to the connexion that has for ages
subsisted between us; if you have forgot the wounds we
have received in fighting by your side for the extension of
the empire; if our commerce is not an object below your
consideration; if justice and humanity have lost their influence on your hearts; still motives are not wanting to excite your indignation at the measures now pursued: your
wealth, your honour, your liberty are at stake.
Notwithstanding the distress to which we are reduced,
we sometimes forget our own afflictions, to anticipate and
sympathize in yours.  We grieve that rash and inconsiderate counsels should precipitate the destruction of an empire which has been the envy and admiration of ages; and
call God to witness,;that we would part with our property,
endanger our lives, and sacrifice every thing but liberty, to
redeem you from ruin.
A cloud hangs over your heads and ours: ere this reaches
you, it may probably burst upon us. Let us, then, (before
the remembrance of former kindness is dbliterated,) once
more repeat those appellations which are ever grateful in
our ears; let us entreat Heaven to avert our ruin, and the
destruction that threatens our friends, brethren, and countrymen, on the other side of the Atlantic.
28.---CHIARACTER OF BLANNERHASSETT.
May it please your Honours,--LET US now put the case
between Burr and Blannerhassett. Let us compare the
two men, and settle the question of precedence between
them. Who then is Blannerhassett? A native of Ireland,
a man of letters, who fled from the storms of his own country to find quiet in ours. Possessing himself of a beautiful
island in the Ohio, he rears upon it a palace, and decorates
it with every romantic embellishment of fancy. A shrubbery,
that Shenstone might have envied, blooms around him.
Music, that might have charmed Calypso and her nymphs,
is his. An extensive library spreads its treasures before

him. A philosophical apparatus offers to him all the secrets
and mysteries of nature. Peace, tranquillity, and innocence shed their mingled delights around him.'I'he evidence woul(l convince you that this is but a faint
picture of the real life. In the midst of all this peace, this
innocent simplicity and this tranquillity, this feast of' the
imind, this pure banquet of the heart, the destroyer comes;
he comes to change his paradise into a hell.  A stranger
presents himself. Introduced to their civilities, by the high
rank which he had lately held in his country, he soon finds
his way to their hearts by the dignity and elegance of his
demeanour, the light and beauty of his conversation, and
the seductive and fascinating power of his address.
The conquest was not difficult.  Innocence is ever simple and cred.ulous. Conscious of no design itself, it suspects
none in others. It wears no guard before its breast. Every
door and portal and avenue of the heart is thrown open, and
all, who choose it, enter.  Such was the state of Eden,
when the serpent entered its bowers.  The prisoner, in a
more engaging form, winding himself into the open and
unpractised heart of the unfortunate Blannerhassett, found
but little difficulty in changing the native character of that
heart, and the objects of its affection.  By degrees he infuses into it the poison of his own ambition. He breathes
into it the fire of his own courage; a daring and desperate
thirst for glory; an ardour panting for great enterprises,
for all the storm and bustle and hurricane of life.
In a short time the whole man is changed, and every
object of his former delight is relinquished. No more he
enjoys the tranquil scene; it has become flat and insipid
to his taste. His books are abandoned. His retort and
crucible are thrown aside. His shrubbery blooms and
breathes its fragrance upon the air in vain; he likes it not.
His ear no longer drinks the rich melody of music; it longs
for the trumpet's clangour and the cannon's roar. Even
the prattle of his babes, once so sweet, no longer affects
him; and the angel smile of his wife, which hitherto
touched his bosom with ecstasy so unspeakable, is now
unseen and unfelt.
Greater objects have taken possession of his soul.  His
imagination has been dazzled by visions of diadems, of
stars and garters, and titles of nobility. He has been taught
114to burn, with restless emulabJon, at the names of great
heroes and conquerors. IIis enchanted island is destined
soon to relapse into a wilderness; and, in a few months,
we find the beautiful and tender partner of his bosom, whom
he lately'permitted not the winds of summer to visit too
roughly,' we find her shivering at midnight, on the winter
banks of the Ohio, and mingling her tears with the torrents
that froze as they fell.
Yet this unfortunate man, thus deluded from his interest
and his happiness, thus seduced from the paths of inlnocence and peace, thus confounded in the toils that were
deliberately spread for him, and overwhelmed by the mastering spirit and genius of another-this man, thus ruined
and undone, and made to play a subordinate part in this
grand drama of guilt and treason, this man is to be called
the principal offender, while he, by whom he was thus
plunged in misery, is comparatively innocent, a mere
accessary!
Is this reason? Is it law? Is it humanity? Sir, neither
the human heart nor the human understanding will bear a
perversion so monstrous and absurd! so shocking to the
soul! so revolting to reason! Let Aaron Burr, then, not
shrink from the high destination which he has courted, and
having already ruined Blannerhassett in fortune, character,
and happiness, for ever, let him not attempt to finish the
tragedy, by thrusting that ill-fated man between himself and
punishment.                                     WIRT.
29.-EXTRACT FROM MR. HAYNE'S SPEECH IN THE SENATE
OF THE UNITED STATES, 1830.
IF there be one state in the union, Mr. President, (and I
say it not in a boastful spirit,) that may challenge comparison
with any other for a uniform, zealous, ardent, and uncalculating devotion to the union, that state is South Carolina.
Sir, from the very commencement of the revolution up to
this hour, there is no sacrifice, however great, she has not
cheerfully made; no service she has ever hesitated to perform. She has adhered to you in your prosperity; but in
your adversity, she has clung to you with more than filial
affection.  No matter what was the condition of her

domestic affairs, though deprived of her resources, divided
by parties, or surrounded by difficulties, the call of the
country has been to her as the voice of God. Domestic
discord ceased at the sound, every man became at once
reconciled to his brethren, and the sons of Carolina were all
seen crowding together to the temple, bringing their gifts
to the altar of their common country.
What, sir, was the conduct of the South during the revolution?  Sir, I honour New England for her conduct in
that glorious struggle. But great as is the praise which
belongs to her, I tlhink at least equal honour is due to the
South. They espoused the quarrel of tlleir brethren with
a generous zeal, which did not suffer themn to stop to calculate their interest in the dispute. Favourites of the mother
country, possessed of neither ships nor seamen to create
commercial rivalship, they migliht have found in their situation a guarantee that their trade would be for ever fostered
and protected by Great Britain. But, trampling on all considerations, either of interest or of safety, they rushed into
the conflict, and, fighting for principle, periled all in the
sacred cause of freedom.
Never was there exhibited in the history of the world,
higher examples of noble daring, dreadful suffering, and
heroic endurance, than by the Whigs of Carolina, during
the revolution. The whole state, from the mountains to the
sea, was overrun by an overwhelming force of the enemy.
The fruits of industry perished on the spot where they
were produced, or were consumed by the foe.     The'plains of Carolina' drank up the most precious blood of
her citizens! Black and smoking ruins marked the places
which had been the habitations of her children! Driven
from their homes into tile gloomy and almost impenetrable
swamps, even there the spirit of liberty survived, and South
Carolina, sustained by the example of her Sumpters and lher
Marions, proved by her conduct, that thouigh her soil might
be overrun, the spirit of her people was invincible.
HAYNE.
30.-NATIONAL GLORY.
WE are asked, What have we gained by the war?    I
have shown that we have lost nothling in rights, territory,
116or honour; nothing for which we ought to llave contended,
according to the principles of the gentlemen on the other
side, or according to our own. Have we gained nothing
by the war? Let any man loolk at the degraded condition
of this country before the war, the scorn of the universe,
the contempt of ourselves, and tell me if we have gained
nothing by the war? What is our present situtation?
Respectability and character abroad, security and confidence
at home. If we have not obtained, in the opinion of some,
the full measure of retribution, our character and constitution
are placed on a solid basis never to be shaken.
The glory acquired by our gallant tars, by our Jacksons
and our Browns on the land,-is that nothing?'1'rue, we
had our vicissitudes; there were humiliating events which
the patriot cannot review without deep regret; but thle
great account, when it comes to be balanced, will be found
vastly in our favour. Is there a man who would obliterate
from the proud pages of our history the brilliant achievemrents of Jackson, Brown, and Scott, and the host of heroes
on land and sea, whom I cannot enumerate? Is tilere a
nan who could not desire a participation in the national
glory acquired by the war?  Yes, ndtional glory, which,
however the expression may be condemned by some, must
be cherished by every genuine patriot.
What do I mean by national glory? Glory such as Hull,
Jackson, and Perry have acquired. And are gentlemen
insensible to their deeds-to the value of them in animating
the country in the hour of peril hereafter? Did the battle
of Thermopylae preserve Greece but once?  While the
Mississippi continues to bear the tributes of the Iron
Mountains and the Alleghanies to her Delta and to the
Gulf of Mexico, the eighth of January shall be remembered,
and the glory of that day shall stimulate futaue patriots, and
nerve the arms of unborn freemen in driviilg'he presumptuous invader from our country's soil.
Gentlemen may boast of their inse li,i.ili,y to feelinlgs
inspired by the contemplation of such cvrent;s. But I wo-tld
ask, does the recollection of Bunker':, Hi!l, Saratoga, and
Yorktown afford them no pleasure?  Every act of noble
sacrifice to the country, every i,stair,e of patriotic devot.iov
to her cause, has its benefiiA,nit Aence  A iation's rla

31.- MARCO BOZZARIS.
AT midnight, in his guarded tent,
The Turk was dreaming of the hour,
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his power;
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore
I'he trophies of a conqueror;
In dreams his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch's signet ring,T'hen press'd that monarch's throne,-a king;
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden's garden bird.
An hour pass'd on-tlthe Turk awolie;
That bright dream was his last;
He woke--to hear his sentry's shriek,
"' To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"
He woke-to die midst flame and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and sabre stroke,
And death-shots falling thick and fast,
As lightnings from the mountain cloud;
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band;
" Strike-till the last arm'd foe expires,
Strike--for your altars and. your fires,
Strike-for the green graves of your sires,
God--and your native land!"
They fought-like brave men, long and well;
They piled that ground with Moslem slain;
They conquer'd-but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.
His few surviving comrades saw
His smile, when rang their proud hurrah,
118HALLECK-LANDON.
And the red field was won;
Then saw in death his eyelids close
Calmly, as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
Come to the bridal chamber, death!
Come to the mother, when she feels
For the first time her first-born's breath;Come when thie blessed seals
Which close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke;
Come in consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake shock, the ocean storm;Come when the heart beats high and warm,
With banquet-song, and dance, and wine,
And thou art terrible:' the tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear
Of agony, are thine.
But to the hero, when his sword
Has won the battle for the free,
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be.
Bozzaris! with the storied brave
Greece nurtured in her glory's time,
Rest thee-there is no prouder grave,
Even in her own proud clime.
We tell thy doom without a sigh;
For thou art freedom's now, and fame'sOne of the few, the immortal names,
That were not born to die.      HALLECK.
32.-THE SWORD.'TWAS the battle field, and the cold pale moon
Look'd down on the dead and dying;
And the wind pass'd o'er with a dirge and a wail,
Where the young and the brave were lying.
119THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
With his father's sword in his red, right hand,
And the hostile dead around him,
Lay a youthful chief; but his bed was the ground,
And the grave's icy sleep had bound him.
A reckless rover,'mid death and doom,
Pass'd a soldier, his plunder seeking;
Careless he stepp'd where friend and foe
Lay alike in their life-blood reeking.
Drawn by the shine of the warrior's sword,
The soldier paused beside it;
He wrench'd the hand with a giant's strength,
But the grasp of the dead defied it.
He loosed his hold, and his noble heart
Took part with the dead before hinl;
And he honour'd the brave who died sword in hand,
As with soften'd brow he lean'd o'er him.
"A soldier's death thou hast boldly died,
A soldier's grave won by it;
Before I would take that sword from thine hand,
My own life's blood should dye it.
"Thou shalt not be left for the carrion crow,
Or the wolf to batten o'er thee;
Or the coward insult the gallant dead,
Who in life had trembled before thee."
Then dug he a grave in the crimson earth
Where his warrior foe was sleeping;
And he laid him there, in honour and rest,
With his sword in his own brave keeping.

33.- SPEECH OF SALATHIEL IN FAVOUR OF RESISTING THE
ROMAN POWER.
WHAT! must we first mingle in the cabals of Jerusalem,
and rouse the frigid debaters and disputers of the Sanhedrim into action? Are we first to conciliate the irrecon120cilable, to soften the furious, to purify the corrupt? If
the Romans are to be our tyrants till we can teach patriotism to faction; we may as well build the dungeon at once,
for to the dungeon we are consigned for the longest life
among us.
Death or glory for me. There is no alternative between,
not merely the half-slavery that we now live in and independence, but between the most condign suffering and the
most illustrious security. If the people would rise, through
the pressure of public injury, they must have risen long
since; if fiom private violence, what town, what district,
what family, has not its claims of deadly retribution! Yet
here the people stand, after a hundred years of those
continued stimulants to resistance, as unresisting as in the
day when Pomnpey marched over the threshold of the
temple.
I know your generous friendship, Eleazer, and fear that
your anxiety to save me from the chances of the struggle
may bias your better judgment. But here I pledge myself,
by all that constitutes the honour of man, to strike at all
risks a blow upon the Roman crest that shall echo through
the land.
What! commit our holy cause into the nursing of those
pampered hypocrites, whose utter baseness of heart you
know still more deeply than I do? Linger, till those pestilent profligates raise their price with Florns by betraying
a design, that will be the glory of every man who draws a
sword in it? Vainly, madly, ask a brood that, like the
serpent, engender and fatten among the ruins of their country, to discard their venom, to cast their fangs, to feel for
human feelings? As well ask the serpent itself to rise from
the original curse.
It is the irrevocable nature of faction to be base till it
can be mischievous; to lick the dust until it can sting; to
creep on its belly until it can twist its folds round the victim.
No! let the old pensionaries, the bloated hangers-on in the
traift of every-governor, the open sellers of their country
for filthy lucre, betray me when I leave it in their power.
To the field, I say; once and for all, to the field.

CROLY.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
34.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF PATRICK HENRY IN THE
LEGISLATURE OF VIRGINIA, IN FAVOUR OF PERMITTING THE
BRITISH REFUGEES TO RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-The personal feelings of a politicianl
ought not to be permitted to enter these walls  The question before us is a national one, and in 3eciding it, if we
act wisely, nothing will be regarded but the interest of the
nation. On the altar of my country's good, I, for one, am
willing to sacrifice all personal resentments, all private
wrongs; and I flatter myself that I am not the only manl
in this house who is capable of making such a sacrifice.
We have, sir, an extensive country, without population.
What can be a more obvious policy than that this country
ought to be peopled?  People form the strength and coilstitute the wealth of a nation. I want to see our vast
forests filled up, by some process a little more spee(ly
than the ordinary course of nature. I wish to see these
states rapidly ascending to that rank which their natural
advantages authorize them to hold among the nations of the
earth.
Cast your eyes, sir, over this extensive country. Observe
the salubrity of your climate; the variety and fertility of
your soil; and see that soil intersected, in every quarter,
by bold navigable streams, flowing to the east and to the
west, as if the finger of Heaven were marking out the
course of your settlements, inviting you to enterprise, and
pointing the way to wealth.
Sir, you are destined, at some period or other, to become
a great agricultural and commercial people: the only question is, whether you choose to reach this point by slow
gradations, and at some distant period-lingering on through
a long and sickly minority-subjected meanwhile to the
machinations, insults, and oppressions of enemies foreign
and domestic, without sufficient strength to resist and chastise them;-or whether you choose rather to rush at once,
as it were, to the full enjoyment of those high destinies,
and be able to cope, single-handed, with the proudest
oppressor of the world.
If you prefer the latter course, as I trust you do,-encourage emigration-encourage the husbandmen, the me-.chanics, the merchants of the old world to come and settle
122in the land of promise. Make it the homne of the skilful,
the industrious, the fortunate, and the happy, as well as the
asylum of the distressed. Fill up the measure of your
population as speedily as you can, by the means which
Heaven has placed in your power; and I venture to prophesy there are those now living, who will see this favouredl
land among the most powerful on earth-able, sir, to take
care of herself, without resorting to that policy which is
always so dangerous, though sometimles unavoidable, of
calling in foreign aid.
Yes, sir, they will see her great in arts and in arms-her
golden harvests waving over fields of immeasurable extent
--her commerce penetrating the mrost distant seas, and her
cannon silencing the vain boast of those who now proudly
affect to rule the waves.
Instead of refusing permission to the refugees to return,
it is your true policy to encourage emigration to this country, by every means in your power. Sir, you must have
m.en. You cannot get along without them. Those heavy
forests of timber, under which your lands are groaning,
must be cleared away. Those vast riches which cover the
face of your soil, as well as those which lie hid in its
bosonm, are to be developed and gathered only by the skill
and enterprise of men. Your timber, sir, must be worked
up into ships, to transport the productions of the soil, and
find the best markets for them abroad. Your great want,
sir, is the want of men; and these you must have, and will
have speedily, if you are wise.
Do you ask, sir, how you are to get them? Open your
doors, sir, and they will come in.'Ihe population of the
old world is full to overflowing.  That population is
ground, too, by the oppressions of the governments under
which they live. Sir, they are already standing on tiptoe
upon their native shores, and looking to your coasts with a
wishful and longing eye. They see here, a land blessed
with natural and political advantages, which are not
equalled by those of any other country upon earth--a land
on which a gracious Providence hath emptied the horn
of abundance-a land over which peace hath now stretched
forth her white wings, and where content and plenty lie
down at every door!
123
HENIRY.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Sir, they see something still more attractive than all this.
They see a land in which Liberty hath taken up her abode
-that Liberty whom they had considered as a fabled goddess, existing only in the fancies of the poets. They see
her here, a real divinity--her altars rising on every hand,
throughout these happy states-her glories chanted by
three millions of tongues-and the whole region smiling
under her blessed influence.
Sir, let but this our celestial goddess, Liberty, stretch
forth her fair hand toward the people of the old worldtell them to come and bid them welcome-and you will see
them  pouring in from the north, froln the south, from
the east, and from the west. Your wilderness will be
cleared and settled; your deserts will smile; your ranks
will be filled; and you will soon be in a condition to defy
the powers of any adversary.
But gentlemen object to any accession from Great Britain
-and particularly to the return of the British refugees.
Sir, I feel no objection to the return of those deluded people. They have, to be sure, mistaken their own interests
most wonderfully, and most wofully have they suffered the
punishment due to their offences. But the relations which
we bear to them  and to their native country are now
changed. Their king hath acknowledged our independence. The quarrel is over. Peace hath returned, and
found us a free people.
Let us have the magnanimity, sir, to lay aside our antipathies and prejudices, and consider the subject in a political
light. They are an enterprising moneyed people. They
will be serviceable in taking off the surplus produce of our
lands, and supplying us with necessaries during the infant
state of our manufactures. Even if they be inimical to us,
in point of feeling and principle, I can see no objection, in
a political view, to maliing them tributary to our advantage.
And as I have no prejudices to prevent my making use of
them, so, sir, I have no fear of any mischief they can do
us. Afraid of them! What, sir, shall we, who have laiA
the proud British lion at our feet, now be afraid of htoi
whelps?                                       HENRY.
124RANDOLPH.
35.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF JOHN RANDOLPII IN THE
CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA, IN 1829-1830.
SIR,-I see no wisdom in making this provision for future
changes. You must give governments time to operate on
the people, and give the people time to become gradually
assimilated to their institutions. Almost any thing is better than this state of perpetual uncertainty. A people Inav
have the best form of government that the wit of man ever
devised; and yet, from its uncertainty alone, may, in effect,
live under the worst government in the world. Sir, how
often must I repeat, that change is not reform. I am willing that this new constitution shall stand as long as it is
possible for it to stand, and that, believe me, is a very short
time. Sir, it is vain to deny it. They may say what they
please about the old constitution-the defect is not there.
It is not in the form of the old edifice, neither in the design
nor the elevation: it is in the material-it is in the people
of Virginia. To my knowledge that people are changed
from what they have been. The 400 men who went out
to David were in debt. The partisans of Cesar were in
debt. The fellow labourers of Catiline were in debt.
And I defy you to show me a desperately indebted people
anywhere'who can bear a regular sober government. I
throw the challenge to all who hear me. I say that the
character of the good old Virginia planter-the man who

hard work, and who paid his debts, is passed away. A
new order of things is come. The period has arrived of
living by one's wits-of living by contracting debts that
one cannot pay-and above all, of living by office-hunting.
Sir, what do we see? Bankrupts-branded bankruptsgiving great dinners-sending their children to the most
expensive schools-giving grand parties-and just as well
received as anybody in society. I say, that in such
state of things the old constitution was too good for them;
tlley could not bear it. No, sir-they could not bear a
freehold suffrage and a property representation.
I have always endeavoured to do the&amp;people justice-but

for change. I will do nothing to provide for change. I
will not agree to any rule of future apportionment, or to

any provision for future changes called amendments to the
constitution.' They who love change-who delight in pulblic confusion-who wish to feed the caldron, and make
it bubble-may vote if they please for future changes.
But by what spell-by what formula are you going to bind
the people to all future time? You may make what entries
upon parchment you please. Give me a constitution that
will last for half a centurv--that is all I wish for. No
constitution that you can make will last the one half of half
a century.
Sir, I will stake any thing short of my salvation, that
those who are malcontent now, will be more malcontent
three years hence than they are at this dav. I have no
favour for this constitution. I shall vote against its adoption, and I shall advise all the people of my district to set
their faces-av-and their shoulders against it. But if
we are to have it- -let us not have it with its death-warrant
in its very face, with the Sardonic grin of death upon its
countenance.                                RANDOLPH.
36.-SECOND EXTRACT FROM THE SAME AUTHOR.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-I must notice a topic of the gravest
character which has been several times brought to our view,
by eastern members, in the course of debate. I mean a
separation of the state-at one time gently insinuated-at
another wrapped up in beautiful rhetorical language, and
finally expressed in what has been emphatically called
plain old English. I am not disposed, sir, to regard such
menaces, because I am aware of the extremities of intellectual warfare, and can estimate the effervescence of momentary excitement. They would not be impressed upon
my mind, but for a corresponding sentiment which I have
reason to believe prevails among the western people. I do
not say that if slave representation should be forced upon
them, they will raise the standard of rebellion, or in any
wise resist the constitutedi authorities. Far from it. But
within the pale of the constitution and laws, they will
carry their opposition to the utmost limit; and the members of this committee can estimate the feelings of hostility
by which it will be accompanied.  rhe final result will be
126a separation of the state. No one can doubt that if such
an eveint should be perseveringly, though peaceably sought,
by a large portion of the state, it would be ultimately conceded.
I beg, sir, to be distinctly understood.  There is no one
in this committee to whom the idea of such a separation is
more abhorrent than myself. I believe there is no man
lhere who wishes separation for its own sake, or who could
contemplate it for a moment, except as a refuge from greater
evils.
We should look forward to such1 a calamity, only to
deprecate and avoid it. Surely, it will not-must not be.
Separate Virginia?  Shall she be shorn of her strength,
her influence, and her glory? Shall her voice of command,
of persuasion, and reproof, be no longer heard in the national councils? Shall she no more be looked up to as the
guide of the strong, the guardian of the weak, and the protector of the oppressed? Break in twain the most precious
jewel, and the separated parts are comparatively worthless.
Divide Virginia, and both the east and the west will sink
into insignificance, neglect, and contempt.
I would to God, that for this single occasion only, I
could utter my feelings in
"Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn."
I would kindle a flame, which should find an altar in every
heart-which should burn to ashes the prejudices of the
hour, and the petty interests of the day,-and throw upon
our path of duty a strong and steady light, directing us
forward to the permanent welfare, safety, and honour of
Virginia.                                  RANDOLPH.
37.- THE TORCH OF LIBERTY.

I saw the expectant nations stand,
To catch the coming flame in turnI saw, from ready hand to hand,
The clear, but struggling glory burn.
And, 0, their joy, as it came near,'Twas, in itself, a joy to seeWhile fancy whisper'd in my ear,
" That torch they pass is liberty!"
And each, as she received the flame,
Lighted her altar with its ray;
Then, smiling, to the next who came,
Speeded it on its sparkling way.
From Albion first, whose ancient shrine
Was furnish'd with the fire already,
Columbia caught the spark divine,
And lit a flame, like Albion's, steady.
The splendid gift then Gallia took,
And, like a wild Bacchante, raising
The brand aloft, its sparkles shook,
As she would set the world a-blazing!
And, when she fired her altar, high
It flash'd into the reddening air
So fierce, that Albion, who stood nigh,
Shrunk, almost blinded by the glare!
Next, Spain, so new was light to her,
Leap'd at the torch--but, ere the spark
She flung upon her shrine could stir,'Twas quench'd-and all again was dark
Yet, no-not quench'd-a treasure, worth
So much to mortals, rarely diesAgain her living light look'd forth,
And shone, a beacon, in all eyes!
Who next received the flame? alas!
Unworthy Naples.-Shame of shames,
That ever through such hands should pass
That brightest of all earthly flames!
128MOORE-DUPONCEAU.
Scarce had her fingers touch'd the torch,
When, frighted by the sparks it shed,
Nor waiting e'en to feel the scorch,
She dropped it to the earth-and fled.
And fall'n it might have long remain'd;
But Greece, who saw her moment now,
Caught up the prize, though prostrate, stain'd,
And waved it round her beauteous brow.
And fancy bade Ine mark where, o'er
Her altar, as its flame ascended,
Fair laurell'(l spirits seem'd to soar,
Who thus in song thieir voices blended:
"Shine, shine for ever, glorious flame,
Divinest gift of God to men!
From Greece thy earliest splendour came,
To Greece thy ray returns again.
"rTake, freedom, take thy radiant roullnd;
When dimm'd, revive,-when lost, return,
Till not a shrine through earth be found,
On which thy glories shall not burn!"

J8.-CHARACTER OF WILLIAM PENN.
WILLIAM PENN stands the first among the lawgivers,
whose names and deeds are recorded in history. Silaill
we compare with him Lycurgus, Solon, Romulus, those
founders of military commonwealths, who organized their
citizens in dreadful array against the rest of their species,
taught them to consider their fellow men as barbarians,
and themselves as alone worthy to rule over the earth?
What benefit did mankind derive from their boasted institutions? Interrogate the shades of those who fell in the
mighty contests between Athens and Lacedeinon, between
Carthage and Rome, and between Rome and the rest of the
universe.
But see William Penn, with weaponless hand, sitting
down peaceably with his followers in the midst of savage
nations, whose only occupation was shedding the blood of
129THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
their fellow men, disarming them by his justice, and teaching them, for the first time, to view a stranger without distrust. See them bury their tomahawks in his presence so
deep, that man shall never be able to find them again. See
them under the shade of the thick groves of Coaquannock
extend the bright chain of friendship, and solemnly promise
to preserve it as long as the sun and moon shall endure.
See him then with his companions establishing his commonwealth on the sole basis of religion, morality, and universal
love, and adopting as the fundamental maxim of his government the rule handed down to us from heaven, glory to
God on high, and on earth peace, and good will to all men.
Here was a spectacle for the potentates of the earth to
look upon, an example for them to imitate. But the potentates of the earth - did not see, or if they saw, they turne(l
away their eyes from the sight: they did not hear, or if
they heard, they shut their ears against the voice, which
called out to them from the wilderness.
Discite justitiam moniti et non temnere Divos.
The character of William Penn alone sheds a neverfading lustre on our history.         DUPONCEAU.
39.-SPEECHI OF A CHRISTIAN MARTYPR.
FOR what have these my brethren died? Answer me,
priests of Romne; what temple did they force-what altar
overthrow-what insults offer to the slightest of.your public
celebrations? Judges of Rome, wliat offence did they
commit against the public peace?  Consuls, where were
they found in rebellion against the Roman majesty? People! patricians! who among your thousands can charge
one of these holy dead with extortion-, impurity, or violence; can charge them with any thing, but the patience
that bore wrong without a murmur, and the charity that
answered tortures only by prayers?
Do I stand here demanding to be believed for opinions?
No; but for facts. I have seen the sick made whole, the
lame walk, the blind receive their sight, by the mere name
of Him whom you crucified. I have seen men once
ignorant of all languages but their own, speaking with the
language of every nation under heaven--the still greater
i30wonder, of the timid defying all fear--the unlearned
instantly made wise in the mysteries of things divine and
human-putting to shame the learned-humbling the proud
--enlightening the darkened; alike in the courts of kings,
before the furious people, and in the dungeon, armed with
an irrepressible spirit of knowledge, reason and truth, that
confounded their adversaries.
I have seen the still greater wonder of the renewed heart;
the impure, suddenly abjuring vice; the covetous, the cruel,
thle faithless, the godless, gloriously changed into the holy,
the gentle, the faithful, the worshipper of the true God in
spirit and in truth; the conquest of the passions which
defied your philosophers, your tribunals, your rewards,
your terrors, achieved in the one mighty name. There are
facts, things which I have seen; and who that had seen
them could doubt, that the finger of the eternal God was
there?
I dared not refuse my belief to the divine mission of
the Being by whom, and even in memory of whom, things,
baffling the proudest human means, were wrought before
my eyes. Thus irresistibly compelled by facts to believe
that Christ was sent by God; I was with equal force compelled to believe in the doctrines declared by this glorious
Messenger of the Father alike of quick and dead. And
thus I stand before you this day, at the close of a long life
of labour and hazard, a Christian.        CROLY.
40.-PROPER'Y AN ELEMENT OF SOCIETY.
THE question before us, is not whether a majority shall
rule in the legislature, but of what elements that majority
shall be composed. If the interests of the several parts of
the commonwealth were identical, it would be, we admit,
safe and proper that a majority of persons only should give
the rule of political power. But our interests are not
identical, and the difference between us arises from property alone. We therefore contend that property ought to
be considered, in fixing the basis of representation.
What, sir, are the constituent elements of society?
Persons andproperty. What are the subjects of legislation  
Persons and property.  Was there ever a society seen on
131
CROLY ---UPSHUR.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
earth which consisted only of men, women and children?
I'he very idea of society carries with it the idea of property, as its necessary and inseparable attendant.  History
cannot show any form of the social compact, at any time,
or in any place, into which property did not enter as a
constituent element, nor one in which that element did not
enjoy protection in a greater or less degree. Nor was there
ever a society in which the protection once extended to
property was afterward withdrawn, which did not fall an
easy prey to violence and disorder.  Society cannot -exist
without property; it constitutes the full half of its being.
Take away all protection from property, and our next
business is to cut each other's throats. All experience
proves this. The safety of men depends on the safety of
property; the rights of persons must mingle in the ruin of
the rights of property. And shall it not then be protected?
Sir, your government cannot move an inch without property. Are you to have no political head? No legislature
to make laws? no judiciary to interpret them? no executive
to enforce them? And if you are to have all these departments, will they render their services out of mere grace
and favour, and for the honour and glory of the thing?
Not in these money-loving days, depend on it. If we
would find patriotism thus disinterested, we must indeed
go back to a period prior to Bible history.
And what are the subjects upon which the law-making
power is called to act? Persons and property. To these
two subjects, and not to one of them alone, is the business
of legislation confined. And of these two, it may be fairly
asserted that property is not only of equal, but even of more
importance. The laws which relate to our personal actions, with reference to the body politic; which prescribe
the duties which we owe to the public, or define and punish
crime, are comparatively few in number, and simple in their
provisions. And one half of these few find their best
sanctions in public opinion. But the ramifications of the
rights of property are infinite. Volume upon v-olume,
which few of us, I fear, are able to understand, are required
to contain even the leading principles relating to them;
and yet new relations are every day arising, which require
continual interpositions of the legislative power.
If, then, sir, property is thus necessary to the very being
132of society; thus indispensable to every movement of
government; if it be that subject upon which government
chiefly acts; is it not, I would ask, entitled to such protection as shall be above all suspicion, and free from every
hazard?
Gentlemen have admitted the principle, that, property
must be protected, and protected in the very form now
proposed; they are obliged to admit it. It would be a wild
and impracticable scheme of government, which did not
admit it. Among all the various and numerous propositions, lying upon your table, is there one which goes the
length of proposing universal suffrage?  There is none.
Yet this subject is in direct connexion with that. Why
do you not admit a pauper to vote? He is a person: he
counts one in your numerical majority. In rights strictly
personal, he has as much interest in the govurnment as any
other citizen. He is liable to commit the same offences,
and to become exposed to the same punishments as the
rich man. Why, then, shall he not vote?
Because, thereby, he would receive an influence over
property; and all who own it, feel it to be unsafe to put
the power of controlling it into the hands of those who are
not the owners. If you go on population alone, as the
basis of representation, you will be obliged to go the length
of giving the elective franchise to every human being
over twenty-one years,-yes, and under twenty-one years,
-on whom your penal laws take effect; an experiment,
which has met with nothing but utter and disastrous failure,
wherever it has been tried. No, Mr. Chairman, let us be
consistent; let us openly acknowledge the truth; let us
boldly take the bull by the horns, and incorporate this influence of property as a leading principle in our constitution.
We cannot be otherwise consistent with ourselves.
I was surprised to hear the assertion made by gentlemen
on the other side, that property can protect itself. What
is the meaning of such a proposition? Is there any thing in
property, to exert this self-protecting influence, but the
political power which always attends it? Is there any thing
in mere property alone, in itself consideredi to exert any
such influence? Can a bag of golden guineas, if placed
upon that table, protect itself?  Can it protect its owner?
I do not know what magic power the gentlemen allude to.
12
133
UPSHUR.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
If it is to have no influence in the government, what and
where is its power to protect itself? Perhaps the power
to buy off violence; to buy off the barbarian who coines to
lay it waste, by a reward, which will but invite a double
swarm of barbarians to return next year. Is this one of
the modes alluded to? This, I am well assured, never
entered into the clear mind of the very intelligent gentleman from Frederick.
How else, then, may property be expected to protect
itself? It may be answered, by the influence which it gives
to its owner. But in what channels is that influence exerted? It is the influence which prevents the poor debtor
from going against the will of his creditor; which forbids
the dependent poor man from exerting any thing like independence, either in conduct or opinion; an influence which
appeals to avarice on both sides, and depends for its effect
on rousing the worst and basest of passions, and destroying
all freedom of will, all independence of opinion.
Is it desirable to establish such an influence as this? an
influence which marches to power through the direct road
to the worst, and most monstrous of aristocracies,--the aristocracy of the purse? An influence which derives its effect
from the corruption of all principle, the blinding of the
judgment, and the prostration of all moral feeling? and
whose power is built on that form of aristocracy, most of
all to be dreaded in a free government?  The gentlemlan
appeals to fact, and says that property always has protected
itself, under every form of government. The fact is not
admitted. Property never has protected itself long, except
by the power which it possessed in the government.
UPSH-UR.
41.-WHAT'S HIALLOWED GROUND?
WHAT'S hallow'd ground? Has earth a clod
Its Maker meant not should be trod
By man, the image of his God,
Erect and free,
Unscourged by superstition's rod'To bow the knee?
134That's hallow'dl groiind-where, mourn'd and miss'd,
The lips repose our love has kiss'd;But where's their memory's mailsion? Is't
Yon churchyard's bowers?
No! in ourselves their souls exist,
A part of ours.
A kiss call consecrate the ground
Where mated hearts are mutual bound:
The spot where love's first links were wound,
T'hat ne'er are riven,
Is hallow'd, down to earth's profound,
And up to heaven!
For time makes all but true love old;
The burning thoughts that then were told
Run molten still in memory's mould,
And will not cool
Until the heart itself be cold
In Lethe's pool.
What hallows ground where heroes sleep?'Tis not the sculptured piles you heap:
In dews that heavens far distant weep
Their turf may bloom;
Or Genii twine beneath the deep'rheir coral tomb.
But strew his ashes to the wind,
Whose sword or voice has saved mankindAnd is he dead, whose glorious mind
Lifts thine on high?
To live in hearts we leave behind,
Is not to die.
Is't death to fall for freedom's right?
He's dead alone that lacks her light?
And murder sullies, in Heaven's sight,
The sword he draws:
What call alone ennoble fight?
A noble cause!
Give that; and welcome war to brace
Her drums! and rend heaven's reeking space!
CAMPBELL.

The charging cheer
Though death's pale horse lead on the chase,
Shall still be dear.
And place our trophies where men kneel
To Heaven!-But Heaven rebukes my zeal;
The cause of truth and human weal,
0 God above!
Transfer it from the sword's appeal
To peace and love!
Peace, love-the cherubim that join
Their spread wings o'er devotion's shrine--
Prayers sound in vain, and teniples shine,
Wher they are not;
The heart alone can make divine
Religion's spot.
To incantations dost thou trust,
And pompous rites in domes august?
See mouldering stones and metal's rust
Belie the vaunt,
That men can bless one pile of dust
With chime or chant.
The ticking wood-worm mocks thee, man!
Thy temples--creeds themselves grow wan!
But there's a dome of nobler span,
A temple given
Thy faith, that bigots dare not banIts space is heaven!
Its roof star-pictured, nature's ceiling,
Where trancing the rapt spirit's feeling,
And God himself to man revealing,
The harmonious spheres
Make music, though unheard their pealing,
By mortal ears.
Fair stars! are not your beings pure?
Can sin, can death your world's obscure?
Else why so swell the thoughts at your
Aspect above?
Ye must be heavens that make us sure
Of heavenly love!
136CAMPBELL-COLERIDGE.
And in your harmony sublime
I read the doom of distant time;
That man's regenerate soul from crime
Shall yet be drawn,
And reason on -his mortal clime
Immortal dawn.
What's hallow'd grounld?'Tis what gives birth
To sacred thoughts in souls of worth!
Peace! independence! truth! go forth
Earth's compass round;
And your high priesthood,shall make earth
All hallow'd ground!  CAMPBELL.
42.-SPEECH OF RAAB KIUPRILI.
HEAR lne
Assembled lords and warriors of Illyria,
Hear, and avenge me! Twice ten years have I
Stood in your presence, honour'd by the king,
Beloved and trusted. Is there one among you,
Accuses Raab Kiuprili of a bribe?
Or one false whisper in his sovereign's ear?
Who here dares charge me with an orphan's rights
Outfaced, or widow's plea left undefended?
And shall I now be branded by a traitor,
A bought-bribed wretch, who, being called my son,
Doth libel a chaste matron's name, and plant
Hensbane and aconite on a mother's grave?
Th' underling accomplice of a robber,
That from a widow and a widow's offspring
Would steal their heritage? To God a rebel,
And to the common father of his country
A recreant ingrate!
What means this clamour? Are these madmen's voices?
Or is some knot of riotous slanderers leagued
To infamize the name of the king's brother
With a black falsehood? Unmanly cruelty,
Ingratitude, and most unnatural treason?
What mean these murmurs? Dare then any here
Proclaim Prince Emerick a spotted traitor?

CONTENTS.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
One that has taken from you your sworn faith,
And given you in return a Judas' bribe,
Infamy now, oppression in reversion,
And Heaven's inevitable curse hereafter?
Yet bear with me a while? Have I for this
Bled for your safety, conquer'd for your honour?
Was it for this, Illyrians! that I forded
Your thaw-swollen torrents, when the shouldering ice
Fought with the foe, and stain'd its jagged points
With gore from wounds 1 felt not? Did the blast
Beat on this body, frost and famine-numb'd,
Till my hard flesh distinguish'd not itself
From the incensate mail, its fellow warrior?
And have I brought home with me victory,
And with her, hand in hand, firm-footed peace,
Her countenance twice lighted up with glory,
As if I had charm'd a goddess down fromi heaven!
But these will flee abhorrent from the throne
Of usurpation! Have you then thrown off shame,
And shall not a dear friend, a loyal subject,
Throw off all fear? I tell ye, the fair trophies,
Valiantly wrested from a valiant foe,
Love's natural offerings to a rightful king,
Will hang as ill on this usurping traitor,
This brother-blight, this Emerick, as robes
Of gold pluck'd from the images of gods
Upon a sacrilegious robber's back.    COLERIDGE
43.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF MR. G.- MORRIS ON THE
JUDICIARY ESTABLISHMENT.
Is there a member of this house who can lay his hand
on his heart and say, that, consistently with the plain words
of our constitution, we have a right to repeal this law? I
believe not. And, if we undertake to construe this constitution to our purposes, and say that the public opinion is to
be our judge, there is an end to all constitutions. To what
will not this dangerous doctrine lead?  Should it to-day be
the popular wish to destroy the first magistrate-you can
destroy him. And should he, to-morrow, be able to conciliate to him the popular will, and lead them to wish for
138your destruction, it is easily effected. Adopt this principle,
and the whim of the moment will not only be the law, bui
the constitution of our country.
The gentlemanl from Virginia has mentioned a great
nation brought to the feet of one of her servants. But why
is she in that situation? Is it not because popular opinion
was called on to decide every thing, until those who wore
bayonets decided for all the rest?  Our situation is peculiar.
At present our national compact can prevent a state from
acting hostilely toward the general interest.  But, let this
compact be destroyed, and each state beconmes instantaneously invested with absolute sovereignty.  But what, I
ask, will be the situation of these states (organized as they
now are) if, by the dissolution of our national compact,
they be left to themselves? What is the probable result?
We shall either be the victims of foreign intrigue, and, split
into factions, fall under the domination of a foreign power;
or else, after the misery and torment of civil war, become
the subjects of an usurping military despot.  What but
this compact--what but this specific part of it can save us
from ruin? The judicial power, that fortress of the constitution, is now to be overturned.
Yes, with honest Ajax, I would not only throw a shield
before it-I would build around it a wall of brass.  But I
am too weak to defend the rampart against the host of
assailants.  I must call to my assistance their good sense,
their patriotism, and their virtue. Do not, gentlemen,
suffer the rage of passion to drive reason from her seat. If
this law be indeed bad, let us join to remedy the defects.
Has it beern passed in a manner which wounded your pride
or roused your resentment? Have, I conjure you, the magnanimity to pardon that offence. I entreat, I implore you,
to sacrifice these angry passions to the interests of our
country. Pour out this pride of opinion on the altar of
patriotism. Let it be an expiatory libation for the weal of
America. Do not, for God's sake, do not suffer that pride
to plunge us all into the abyss of ruin.
Indeed, indeed, it will be but of little, very little avail,
whether one opinion or the other be right or wrong: it will
heal no wounds; it will pay no debts; it will rebuild no
ravaged towns. Do not rely on that popular will which
has brought us frail beings into political existence. That

opinion is but a changeable thing. It will soon change.
This very measure will change it. You will be deceived.
Do not, I beseech you, in reliance on a foundation so frail,
commit the dignity, the harmony, the existence of our
nation to the wild wind. Trust not your treasure to the
waves. Throw not your compass and your charts into the
ocean. Do not believe that its billows will waft you into
port. Indeed, indeed, you will be deceived. 0! cast not
away this only anchor of our safety. I have seen its progress. I know the difficulties through which it was obtained.
I stand in the presence of Almighty God and of the world.
I declare to you, that if you lose this charter, never, no
never, will you get another! We are now, perhaps,
arrived at the parting point. Here, even here we stand on
the brink of fate. Pause! Pause! For heaven's sake--
pause!                                        MoRaIS.
44.-DECISION OF CHARACTER.
THE man who is so conscious of the rectitude of his
intentions, as to be willing to open his bosom to the
inspection of the world, is in possession of one of the
strongest pillars of a decided character. The course of
such a man will be firm and steady, because he has nothing
to fear from the world, and is sure of the approbation
and support of Heaven. While he, who is conscious of
secret and dark designs which, if known, would blast him,
is perpetually shrinking and dodginig from public observation, and is afraid of all around, and much more of all
above him.
Such a man may, illdeed, pursue his iniquitous plans,
steadily; lie may waste himself to a skelefbn in the guilty
pursuit; but it is impossible that he cani pursue them with
the same health-inspiring confidence, and exulting alacrity,
with him who feels, at every step, that he is in the pursuit
of honest ends, by honest means. The clear, unclouded
brow, the open countenance, the brilliant eye which can
ook an honest man stea(lfastly yet courteously in the face,
the healthfully beating heart, and the firm  elastic step,
belong to him whose bosom is free from guile, and who
lknoows that all his motives and purposes are pure and-right.
140Wihy should such a man falter in his course?  He mnay
be slandered; he may be deserted by the world: but lie
has that within which will kept him erect, and enable himn
to move onward in his course with his eyes fixed on
Heaven, which he knows will not desert him.
Let your first step, then, in that discipline which is to
give you decision of character, be the heroic deterimination
to be honest men, and to preserve this character througli
every vicissitude of fortune, and in every relation which
connects you with society. I do not use thils phrase,
" honest men," in the narrow sense, merely, of meeting
your pecuniary engagements, and paying your debts; for
this the common pride of gentlemen will constrain you to
do. I use it in its larger sense of discharging all your
duties, both public and private, both open and secret, with
the most scrupulous, heaven-attesting integrity; in that
sense, farther, which drives from the bosom all little, dark,
crooked, sordid, debasing considerations of self, and substitutes in their place a bolder, loftier, and nobler spirit:
one that will dispose you to consider yourselves, as born
not so much for yourselves, as for your country and your
fellow creatures, and which will lead you to act on every
occasion sincerely, justly, generously, magnanimously.
There is a morality on a larger scale, perfectly consistent
with a just attention to your own affairs, which it would be
the height of folly to neglect; a generous expansion, a
proud elevation, and conscious greatness of character,
which is the best preparation for a decided course, in every
situation into which you can be thrown; and it is to this
high and noble tone of character that I would have you
to aspire. I would not have you to resemble those weak
and meager streamlets, which lose their direction at every
petty impediment that presents itself, and stop, and turn
back, and creep around, and search out every little channel
through which they may wind their feeble and sickly
course. Nor yet would I have you to resemble the headlong torrent that carries havoc in its mad career. But I
would have you like the ocean, that noblest emblem of
majestic decision, which, in the calmest hour, still heaves
its resistless might of waters to the shore, filling the
heavens, day and night, with the echoes of its sublime
declaration of independence, and tossing and sporting, on
141
WVIRT.TI-TE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
its bed, with an imperial consciousness of strength that
laughs at opposition. It is this depth, an(d weight, and
power, and purity of' cliaracter, that I would( have you to
resemble; andl I would have you, like the waters of the
ocear, to become the purer by your own action.  WIRT.
45.-BONAPARTE TO TIIE ARMY OF ITALY.
SOLDIERS,-YoU are precipitated lilie a torrent from the
heights of the Apennines; you have overthrown and dispersed all that dared to oppose your march. Piedmont,
rescued from Austrian tyranny, is left to its natural sentiments of regard and friendship to the French. Milan is
yours; and the republican standard is displayed throughout all Lombardy. The dukes of Parma and Modena
are indebted for their political existence only to your generosity.
The army, which so proudly menaced you, has had no
other barrier than its dissolution to oppose your invincible
courage. The Po, the Tessen, the Adda, could not retard
you a single day. The vaunted bulwarks of Italy were
insufficient. You swept them with the sarne rapidity that
you did the Apennines.'Those successes have carried joy
into the bosom of your country. Your representatives
decreed a festival dedicated to your victories, and to be
celebrated throughout all the communes of the republic.
Now your fathers, your mothers, your wives, and your
sisters will rejoice in your success, and take pride in their
relation to you.
Yes, soldiers, you have done much; but more still
remains for you to do. Shall it be said of us, that we know
how to conquer, but not to profit by our victories?  Shall
posterity reproach us with having found a Capua in Lomnbardy? But already I see you fly to arms. You are
fatigued with an inactive repose. You lament the days
that are lost to your glory! Well, then, let us proceed;
we have other forced marches to make, other enemies to
subdue; more laurels to acquire, and more injuries to
avenge.
Let those who have unsheathed the daggers of civil war
in France; who have basely assassinated our ministers;
i42who have burnt our ships at Toulon; let theIn tremble' the
linell of vengeance has already tolled!
But to quiet the apprehensions of the people, we declare
ourselves the friends of all, and particularly of those who
are the descendants of Brutus, of Scipio, and those other
great men whom we have taken for our models.'ro re-establish the capital; to replace the statues of those
heroes who have rendered it immortal; to rouse the Roman
people, entranced in so many ages of slavery; this shall be
the fruit of your victories. It will be an epoch for the
admiration of posterity; you will enjoy the immortal glory
of changing the aspect of affairs in the finest part of Europe.
The free people of France, not regardless of moderation,
shall accord to Europe a glorious peace; but it will indemnify itself for the sacrifices of every kind which it has been
making for six years past. You will again be restored to
your firesides and homes; and your fellow citizens, pointing you out, shall say, " There goes one who belonged to
the army of Italy!"                       BONAPARTE.
46.-ON A FUTURE STATE.
THE idea of another and a better world seems to be congenial to the human mind. It has been generally enter
tained in every age. The philosophers of ancient times,
who had nothing but the dim light of nature to direct them,
cherished the ennobling notion of immortal existence.
Even the untutored savage flatters himself with the pleasing
prospect of being one day transported into happier regions,
and anticipates the pleasure which he will there enjoy in
the company of his fathers. All feel within themselves the
pleasing hope, the fond desire, of immortality. But though
nature has given to all her children some conceptions of 4
immortality, still it must be acknowledged that her information is far from proving satisfactory. Hence we find the
most eminent sages of the heathen world, even while desiring and hoping for such a state, confessing themselves
unable to demonstrate its existence.-Doubtful and insecure
were all their prospects.  While toward futurity they bent
their longing eyes, a thick cloud, impenetrable by unassisted
reason, intercepted their view. But from this state of
143
BONAPART rE-SAV  LE.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
painful anxiety we, in these latter days, are happily
relieved. To us immortal life is clearly revealed,-more
clearly than it was even to those ancient worthies to whom
God graciously revealed himself and committed his oracles.
During the dispensation under which they lived, the prospect of a better world was afforded them; but by dark and
distant allusions. The city of God was seen only from
afar;-its glory was obscured by intervening shades.  But
by the gospel these shades are dispelled: the Sun of righteousness has arisen: eternal objects brighten: heaven, with
all its glory, opens to our eyes. There we behold the
",righteous,"-those who are justified by grace, and devoted
to the service of their Saviour, adorned with all the holiness, filled with all the happiness, and clothed with all the
honour, which can be conferred upon their nature. Here
they are as a city set upon a hill: they are the light of the
world: but all this is not worthy to- be named, when:we
think of what they shall be when they " shine forth as the
sun in the kingdom of their Father." There sin and pain
shall never enter: old things shall have passed away, and
all things have become new. The happiness here enjoyed
shall have every thing to increase, and nothing to diminish
its value. In its nature, it shall be full and satisfactory;
and as to its duration, it shall be lasting as eternity.
SAVILE.
47.- ON THE WORKS AND ATTRIBUTES OF THE ALMIGHTY.
CONTEMPLATE the great scenes of nature, and accustom
yourselves to connect them with the perfections of God. All
vast and unmeasurable objects are fitted to impress the soul
with awe. The mountain which rises above the neighbouring hills, and hides its head in the sky-the sounding,
unfathomed, boundless deep-the expanse of heaven, where
above and around no limit checks the wondering eyethese objects fill and elevate the mind-they produce a
solemn frame of spirit, which accords with the sentiment
of religion. From the contemplation of what is great and
magnificent in nature, the soul rises to the Author of all.
We think of the time which preceded the birth of the
uiniverse, when no being existed but God alone.. While
unnumbered systems arise in order before us, created by
144his power, arranged by his wisdom, and filled with his
presence--the earth and the sea, with all that they contain,
are hardly beheld amid the immensity of his works. In
the boundless subject the soul is lost. It is lie who sitteth
on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as
grasshoppers.  He weigfheth the mountains in scales. He
taketh up the isles as a very little thing. Lord, what is
man that thou art mindful of him!'rhe face of nature is sometimes clothied witli terror.
The tempest overturns the cedars of Lebanon, or discloses
the secrets of the deep. The pestilence wastes-the lightning consumes--the voice of the thunder is heard on high.
Let these appearances be connected with the power of God.
These are the awful ministers of his kingdom. The Lord
reigneth, let the people tremble. Who would not fear thee,
O King of nations! By the greatness of thy power thine
enemies are constrained to bow.               MOODIE.
48.---ON THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE.
PAUSE for a while, ve travellers on the earth, to conternplate the universe in which you dwell, and the glory of Him
who created it. What a scene of wonders is here presented
to your view! If beheld with a religious eye, what a temple
for the worship of the Almighty! The earth is spread out
before you, reposing amid the desolation of winter, or
clad in the verdure of the spring-smiling in the beauty of
summer, or loaded with autumnal fruit;-opening to an
endless variety of beings the treasures of their Maker's
goodness, and ministering subsistence and comfort to every
creature that lives. The heavens, also, declare the glory of
the Lord. The sun cometh forth from his chambers to
scatter the shades of night-inviting you to the renewal of
your labours-adorning the face of nature-and, as he advances to his meridian brightness, cherishing every herb and
every flower that springeth from the bosom of the earth.
Nor, when he retires again from your view, doth he leave
the Creator without a witness. He only hides his own
splendour for a while to disclose to you a more glorious
scene-to show you the immensity of space filled with
worlds unnumbered, that your imaginations may wander,
without a limit, in the vast creation of God.
13
MOODIE.
145THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
What a field is here opened for the exercise of every
pious emotion! and how irresistibly do such contemplations
as these awaken the sensibility of the soul! Here is infinite power to impress you with awe-here is infinite
wisdom to fill you with admiration--here is infinite goodness to call forth your gratitude and love. The correspondence between these great objects and the affections of
the human heart is established by nature itself; and they
need only to be placed before us, that every religious feeling may be excited.                           MOODIE.
49.-ON AUTUMN.
LET the young go out, in these hours, under the descending sun of the year, into the fields of nature. Their
hearts are now ardent with hope,-with the hopes of
fame, of honour, or of happiness; and in the long perspective which is before them, their imagination creates a world
where all may be enjoyed. Let the scenes which they
now may witness moderate, but not extinguish their ambition: while they-see the yearly desolation of nature, let
them see it as the emblem of mortal hope;-while they
feel the disproportion between the powers they possess and
the time they are to be employed, let them carry their
ambitious eye beyond the world;-and while in these
sacred solitudes, a voice in their own bosom corresponds to
the voice of decaying nature, let them take that high decision which becomes those who feel themselves the inhabitants of a greater world, and who look to a being incapable
of decay.
Let the busy and the active go out, and pause for a time
amid the scenes which surround them, and learn the high
lesson which nature teaches in the hours of its fall. They
are liow ardent with all the desires of mortality;-and
fame, and.interest, and pleasure are displaying to them
their shadowy promises:--and in the vulgar race of life,
many weak and many worthless passions are too naturally
engendered. Let them withdraw themselves for a time
from the agitations of the world; let them mark the desolafion of summer, and listen to the winds of winter, which
begin to murmur above their heads. It is a sdene which,
with all its power,. has yet no reproach:-it tells thlem, that
14.6such is also the fate to which they must come; that the
pulse of passion must one day beat low; that the illusions
of time must pass; and " that the spirit must return to
Him who gave it." It reminds them, with gentle voice, of
that innocence in which life was begun, and for which no
prosperity of vice can make any compensation; and that
angel who is one day to stand upon the earth, and to
"swear that time shall be no more," seems now to whisper
to them, amid the hollow winds of the year, what manner
of men they ought to be who must meet that decisive
hour.
There is an eventide in human life, a season when the
eye becomes dim, and the strength decays, and when the
winter of age begins to shed upon the human head its prophetic snow. It is the season of life to which the present
is most analogous; and much it becomes, and much it wouldl
profit you, to mark the instructions which the season brings.
The spring and the summer of your days are gone, and with
them, not only the joys they knew, but many of the friends
who gave them. You have entered upon the autumn of
your being, and whatever may have been the profusion of.
your spring, or the warm intemperance of your summer,
there is yet a season of stillness and of solitude which the
beneficence of Heaven affords you, in which you may
meditate upon the past and the future, and prepare yourselves for the mighty change which you are soon to
undergo.
If it be thus you have the wisdom to use the decaying
season of nature, it brings with it consolations more valuable than all the enjoyments of former days. In the long.
retrospect of your journey, you have seen every day the
shades of the evening fall, and every year the clouds of
winter gather. But you have seen also, every succeeding
day, the morning arise in its brightness, and in every succeeding year, the spring return to renovate the winter of
nature. It is now you may understand the magnificent
language of Heaven,-it mingles its voice with that of revelation,-it summons you, in these hours when the leaves
fall and the winter is gathering, to that evening study which
the mercy of Heaven has provided in the book of salvation; and while the shadowy valley opens which leads to
the abode of death, it speaks of that hand which can com

50.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF JAMES WILSON, IN THE
CONVENTION FOR THE PROVINCE OF PENNSYLVANIA, IN
VINDICATION OF THE COLONIES, JANUARY, 1775.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-Whence, sir, proceeds all the invidious
and ill-grounded clamour against the colonists of America?
Why are they stigmatized in Britain as licentious and
ungovernable? Why is their virtuous opposition to the
illegal attempts of their governors, represented under the
falsest colours, and placed in the most ungracious point of
view?
This opposition, when exhibited in its true light, and
when viewed, with uiijaundiced eyes, from a proper situation, and at a proper distance, stands confessed the lovely
offspring of freedom. It breathes the spirit of its parent.
Of this ethereal spirit, the whole conduct, and particularly
the late conduct, of the colonists has shown them eminently
possessed. It has animated and regulated every part of
their proceedings. It has been recognised to be genuine,
by all those symptoms and effects by which it has been
distinguished in other ages and other countries. It has
been calmn and regular: it has not acted without occasion:
it has not acted disproportionably to the occasion. As the
attempts, open or secret, to undermine or to destroy it,
have been repeated or enforced, in a just degree, its vigilance and its vigour have been exerted to defeat or to disappoint them. As its exertions have been sufficient for those
purposes hitherto, let us hence draw a joyful prognostic,
that they will continue sufficient for those purposes hereafter. It is not yet exhausted: it will still operate irresistibly whenever a necessary occasion shall call forth its
strength.
Permit me, sir, by appealing, in a few instances, to the
spirit and conduct of the colonists, to evince that what I
have said of them is just. Did they disclose any uneasiness at the proceedings and claims of the British parliament, before those claims and proceedings afforded a rea148sonable cause for it? Did they even disclose any uneasiness,
when a reasonable cause for it was first given? Our rights
were invaded by their regulations of our internal policy.
We submitted to them: we were unwilling to oppose
them. The spirit of liberty was slow to act.
When those invasions were renewed; when the efficacy
and malignancy of them was attempted to be redoubled by
the stamp act; when chains were formed for us; and preparations were made for riveting them on our limbs, what
measures did we pursue?  The spirit of liberty found it
necessary now to act; but she acted with the calmness and
decent dignity suited to her character. Were we rash or
seditious? Did we discover want of loyalty to our sovereign? Did we betray want of affection to our brethren in
Britain?  Let our dutiful and reverential petitions to the
throne; let our respectful, though firm remonstrances to the
parliament; let our warm and,affectionate addresses to our
brethren and (we will still call them) our friends in Great
Britain,-let all thlose, transmitted from every part of the
continent, testify the truth. By their testimony let our
conduct be tried.
As our proceedings, during the existence and operation
of the stamp act, prove fully and incontestably the painful
sensations that tortured our breasts from the prospect of
disunion with Britain; the peals of joy which burst forth
universally, upon the repeal of that odious statute, loudly
proclaim the heartfelt delight produced in us by a reconciliation with her. Unsuspicious because undesigning, we
buried our complaints and the causes of them in oblivion,
and returned, with eagerness, to our former unreserved
confidence. ~ Our connexion with our parent country, and
the reciprocal blessings resulting from it to her and to us,
were the favourite and pleasing topics of our public (lis.
courses and our private conversations. Lulled into delightful security, we dreamed of nothing but increasing fondness,
and friendship, cemented and strengthened by a kind and
perpetual communication of good offices.
Soon, however, too soon, were we awakened from the
soothing dreams! Our enemies renewed their designs
against us, not with less malice, but with more art. Under
the plausible pretence of regulating our trade, and, at the
same time, of making provision for the administration of
13'
]49
WILSON.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
justice, and the support of government, in some of the
colonies, they pursued their scheme of depriving us of our
property without our consent. As the attempts to distress
us, and to degrade us to a rank inferior to that of freemen,
appeared now to be reduced into a regular system, it became proper, on our part, to form a regular system for
counteracting them.  We ceased to import goods from
Great Britain. Was this measure dictated by selfishness
or by licentiousness? Did it not injure ourselves, while it
injured the British merchants and manufacturers?  Was it
inconsistent with the peaceable demeanour of subjects to
abstain from making purchases, when our freedom and our
safety rendered it necessary for us to abstain from them?
A regard for our freedom and our safety was our only motive; for no sooner had the parliament, by repealing part
of the revenue laws, inspired us with the flattering hopes
that ttiey had departed from their intentions of oppressing
and of taxing us, than we forsook our plan for defeating
those intentions, and began to import as formerly. Far
from being peevish or captious, we took no public notice
even of their declaratory law of dominion over us: our
candour led us to consider it as a decent expedient of
retreating from the actual exercise of that dominion.
But, alas! the root of bitterness still remained. The
duty on tea was reserved to furnish occasion to the ministry for a new effort to enslave and to ruin us; and the East
India Company were chosen, and consented to be the detested instruments of ministerial despotism and cruelty. A
cargo of their tea arrived at Boston. By a low artifice of
the governor, and by the wicked activity of the tools of
government, it was rendered impossible to store it up, or to
send it back, as was done at other places. A number of
persons, unknown, destroyed it.
Let us here make a concession to our enemies: let us
suppose, that the transaction deserves all the dark and
hideous colours in which they lhave painted it: let us even
suppose (for our cause admits of an excess of candour) that
all their exaggerated accounts of it were confined strictly to
the truth: what will follow?  Will it follow that every
British colony in America, or even the colony of Massachusetts' Bay, or even the town of Boston, in that colony,
merits the imputation of being factious and seditious? Let
150the frequent mobs and riots, that have happened in Great
Britain upon much more trivial occasions, shame our
calumrniators into silence. Will it follow, because the rules
of order and regular government were, in that instance,
violated by the offenders, that, for this reason, the principles of the constitution, and the maxims of justice, must
be violated by their punishment? Will it follow, because
those who were guilty could not be known, that, therefore,
those who were known not to be guilty must suffer? Will
it follow, that even the guilty should be condemned without being heard-that they should be condemned upon partial testimony, upon the representations of their avowed
and imbittered enemies?  Why were they not tried in
courts of justice known to their constitution, and by juries
of their neighbourhood? Their courts and their juries
were not, in the case of Captain Preston, transported beyond the bounds of justice by their resentment: why, then,
should it be presumed, that, in the case of those offenders,
thev would be prevented from doing justice by their affection?  But the colonists, it seems, must be stripped of
their judicial, as well as of their legislative powers. They
must be bound by a legislature, they must be tried by a
jurisdiction, not their own. Their constitutions must be
changed: their liberties must be abridged: and those who
shall be most- infamously, active in changing their constitutions and abridging their liberties, must, by an express provision, be exempted from punishment.
I do not exaggerate the matter, sir, when I extend these
observations to all the colonists. The parliament meant to
extend the effects of their proceedings to all the colonists.
The plan, on which their proceedings are formed, extends
to them all. From an incident of no very uncommon or
atrocious nature, which happened in one colony, in one
town in that colony, and in which only a few of the inhabitants of that town took a part, an occasion has been
taken by those, who probably intended it, and who certainly prepared the way for it, to impose upon that colony,
and to lay a foundation and a precedent for imposing upon
all the rest, a system of statutes, arbitrary, unconstitutional,
oppressive, in every view, and in every degree subversive of the rights, and inconsistent with even the name, of
freemen.                                      WILsoN.

51.-THE SOLDIER'S DREAIr.
OUR bugles sang truce-for the night cloud had lower'd
And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky;
4nd thousands had sunk on the ground overpower'd,
The weary to sleep, and the wounded to die.
When reposing that night on my pallet of straw,
By the wolf-scaring fagot that guarded the slain;
At the dead of the night a sweet vision I saw,
And thrice ere the morning I dreamt it again.
Methought from the battle-field's drceadful array,
Far, far I had roam'd on a desolate traclk;'Twas autumn-and sunshine arose on the way
To the home of my fathers, that welcomed me back.
I flew to the pleasant fields, traversed so oft
In life's morning march, when my bosom was young;
I heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft,
And knew the sweet strain that the corn-reapers sung.
Then pledged we the wine cup, and fondly I swore
From my home and my weeping friends never to part;
My little ones kiss'd me a thousand times o'er,
And my wife sobb'd- aloud in her fulliess of heart.
Stay, stay with us--rest, thou art weary and worn;
And fain was their war-broken soldier to stay--
But sorrow return'd with the dawning of morn,
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away.
CAMPBELL.
52.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF PATRICK HENRY, ON THE
EXPEDIENCY OF ADOPTING THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION,
DELIVERED IN THE CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA, JUNE 5, 1788.
MR. CHA1RMAN,--- I amn nuchl obliged to the very worthy
gentleman for his encomium. I wish I were possessed of
talents, or possessed of any thing, that might enable me to
elucidate this great subject. I am not free from suspicion:
I am apt to entertain doubts: I rose yesterday to ask a
152question, which arose in my own mind. When I asked that
question, I thought the meaning of my interrogation was
obvious: the fate of this question and of America may
depend on this. Have they said, we, the states? Have
they made a proposal of a compact between states? If
they had, this would be a confederation: it is otherwise
most clearly a consolidated government.  The question
turns, sir, on that poor little thing--the expression, we, the
the people, instead of, the states of America. I nee(l not
take much pains to show, that the principles of this system
are extremely pernicious, impolitic, and dangerous. Is this
a monarchy, like England-a compact between prince and
people; with checks on the former to secure the liberty of
the latter?  Is this a coiifederacy, lilie Holland--an association of a number of indepeident states, each of which
retains its individual sovereignty? It is not a democracy,
wherein the people retain all their rights securely. Had
these principles been adhered to, we should not have been
brought to this alarming transition, friom a confederacy to a
consolidated government. We have no detail of those great
considerations which, in my opinion, ought to have abounded
before we should recur to a government of this kind. Here is
a revolution as radical as that which separated us from Great
Britain. It is as radical, if, in this transition, our rights
and privileges are endangered, and the sovereigiity of the
states relinquished. And cannot we plaiiily see, that this
is actually the case? T'he rights of conscience, trial by
jury, liberty of the press, all your immunities and franchises, all pretensions to human rights and privileges, are
rendered insecure, if not lost, by this change so loudly
talked of by some, and inconsiderately by others. Is this
tame relinquishment of rights worthy of freemen? Is it
worthy of that manly fortitude that ought to characterize
republicans? It is said eight states have adopted this plan.
I declare that if twelve states and a half had adopted it, I
would, with manly firmness, and in spite of an erring
world, reject it.
You are not to inquire how your trade may be increased,
nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but
how your liberties can be secured; for liberty ought to be
the direct end of your government. Is it necessary for
your liberty, that you should abandon those great rights by
163
HENIRY.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
the adoption of this system?  Is the relinquishment of
the trial by jury, and the liberty of the press, necessary for
your liberty-?  Will the abandonment of your most sacred
rights tend to the security of your liberty? Liberty, the
greatest of all earthly blessings--give us that precious
jewel, and you may take every thing else.
53.-SECOND EXTRACT FROM TIE SAME.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-I shall be told I am continually afraid;
but, sir, I have strong cause of apprehension.  In some
parts of the plan before you, the great rights of freemen
are endangered, in other parts absolutely taken away.
How does your trial by jury stand? Ii civil cases gonenot sufficiently secured in criminal-this best privilege is
gone. But we are told, that we need not fear, because
those in power, being our representatives, will not abuse
the powers we put in their hands. I am not well versed in
history; but I will submit to your recollection, whether
liberty has been destroyed most often by the licentiousness of the people, or by the tyranny of rulers. I imagine,
sir, you will find tile balance on the side of tyranny.
Happy will you be, if you miss the fate of those nations,
who, omitting to resist their oppressors, or negligently
suffering their liberty to be wrested from them, have
groaned under intolerable despotism i
Most of the human race are now in this deplorable condition. And those nations who have gone in search of
grandeur, power, and splendour, have also fallen a sacrifice,
and been the victims of their own folly. While they
acquired those visionary blessings, they lost their freedom.
My great objection to this government is, that it does
not leave us the means of defending our rights, or of
waging war against tyrants. It is urged by some gentlemen, that this new plan will bring us an acquisition of
strength; an army, and the militia of the states. This is
an idea extremely ridiculous: gentlemen cannlot be in
earnest. This acquisition will trample on your fallen
liberty. Let my beloved Americans guard against that
fatal lethargy that has pervaded the universe. Have we
the means of resisting disciplined armies, when our only
defence, the militia, is put into the hands of Congress?
154The honourable gentleman said, that great datlger would
ensue, if the convention rose without adopting this system.
I ask, where is that danger? I see none. Other gentlemen have told us, within these walls, that the union is gone
-or that the union will be gone. Is not this trifling with
the judgment of their fellow citizens? Till they tell us
the ground of their fears, I will consider them as irnaginary. I rose to make inquiry where those dangers were:
they could make no answer: I believe I never shall have
that answer. Is there a disposition in the people of this
country to revolt against the dominion of laws? Has there
been a single tumult in Virginia? Have not the people of
Virginia, when labouring under the severest pressure of
accumulated distresses, manifested the most cordial acquiescence in the execution of the laws?  What could be
more lawftl than their unanimous acquiescence under
general distresses? Is there any revolution in Virginia?
Whither is the spirit of America gone? Whither is the
genius of America fled?  It was but yesterday, when our
enemies marched in triumph through our country. Yet
the people of this country could not be appalled by their
pompous armaments: they stopped their career, and victoriously captured them: where is the peril now, compared to
that?
Some minds are agitated by foreign alarms. Happily
for us, there is no real danger from Europe: that country
is engaged in more arduous business: from that quarter,
there is no cause of fear: you may sleep in safety for ever
for them. Where is the danger? If, sir, there was any,
I would recur to the American spirit to defend us-that
spirit which has enabled us to surmount the greatest difficulties; to that illustrious spirit I address my most fervent
prayer, to prevent our adopting a system  destructive to
liberty.
Let not gentlemen be told, that it is not safe to reject this
government. Wherefore is it not safe? We are told there
are dangers; but those dangers are ideal; they cannot be
demonstrated. To encourage us to adopt it, they tell us,
that there is a plain, easy way of getting amendments.
When I come to contemplate this part, I suppose that I am
mad, or that my countrymen are so. The way to amendmient is, in my conception, shut.
1i5
HENRY.156            THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
54.-THIRD EXTRACT FROM THE SAME.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-The honourable gentleman's observations, respecting the people's right of being the agents in
the formation of this government, are not accurate, in my
humble conception.'I'he distinction between a national
government and a confederacy is not sufficiently discerned.
Had the delegates, who were sent to Philadelphia, a power
to propose a consolidated government instead of a confederacy? Were they not deputed by states, and not by the
people? The assent of the people, in their collective
capacity, is not necessary to the formation of a federal
government. The people have no right to enter into
leagues, alliances, or confederations: they are not the
proper agenits for this purpose: states and sovereign powers
are the only proper agents for this kind of government.
Show me an instance where the people have exercised this
business: has it not always gone through the legislatures?
I refer you to the treaties with France, Holland, and
other nations: how were they made?   Were they not
made by the states? Are the people, therefore, in their
aggregate capacity, the proper persons to form a confederacy? This, therefore, ought to depend on the conseint of
the legislatures; the people having never sent delegates to
make any proposition of changing the government. Yet I
must say, at the same time, that it was made on grounds
the most pure; and perhaps I might have been brought to
consent to it, so far as to the change of government; but
there is one thing in it which I never would acquiesce in.
I mean, the changing it into a consolidated government,
which is so abhorrent to my mind.
The honourable gentleman then went on to the figure we
make with foreign nations; the contemptible one we make
in France and Holland, which, according to the substance
of my notes, he attributes to the present feeble governrment. An opinion has gone forth, we find, that we are a
contemptible people: the time has been when we were
thought otherwise. Under this same despised government,
we commanded the respect of all Europe: wherefore are
we now reckoned otherwise? The American spirit has
fled irom hence: it has gone to regions where it has never
been expected: it has gone to the people of France, in searchof a splendid government--a strong energetic government.
Shall we imitate the example of those nations who have
gone from a simple to a splendid government?  Are those
nations more worthy of our imitation? What can make an
adequate satisfaction to them for the loss they have suffered
in attaining such a government-for the loss of their liberty?
If we admit this consolidated government, it will. be because
we like a great and splendid one. Some way or other we
must bea great and mighty empire: we must have an army,
and a navy, and a number of things. When the American
spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different: liberty, sir, was then the primary object. We are
descended from a people whose government was founded on
liberty: our glorious forefathers, of Great Britain, made
liberty the foundation of every thing. That country is
become a great, mighty, and splendid nation; not because
their government is strong and energetic; but, sir, because
liberty is its direct end and foundation. We drew the
spirit of liberty from our British ancestors: by that spirit
we have triumphed over every difficulty. But now, sir,
the American spirit, assisted by the ropes and chains of
consolidation, is about to convert this country into a powerful and mighty empire. If you make the citizens of this
country agree to become the subjects of one great consolidated empire of America, your government will not have
sufficient energy to keep them together: such a government is incompatible with the genius of republicanism.
There will be no checks, no real balances, in this government. What can avail your specious, imaginary balances;
your rope-dancing, chain-rattling, ridiculous, ideal checks
and contrivances? But, sir, we are not feared by foreigners: we do not make nations tremble. Would this constitute happiness, or secure liberty? I trust, sir, our political
hemisphere will ever direct its operations to the security of
those objects. Consider our situation, sir: go to the poor
man; ask him what he does; he will inform you that he
enjoys the fruits of his labour, under his own fig tree, withi
his wife and children around him in peace and security.
Go to every other member of the society; you will find the
same tranquil ease and content; you will find no alarms or
disturbances! Why, then, tell us of dangers, to terrify us
into an adoption of this new form of government? And yet

who knows the dangers that this new system may produce? They are out of the sight of the common people:
they cannot foresee latent consequences.. I dread the operation of it on the middling and lower classes of people:
it is for them I fear the adoption of this system.
55.-FOURTH EXTRACT FROM THE SAME.
MR. CHAIRMAN,--The next clause of the bill of rights
tells you, " that all power of suspending law, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without the consent of
the representatives of the people, is injurious to their
rights, and ought not to be exercised."  This tells us that
there can be no suspension of government, or laws, without our own consent; yet this constitution can counteract
and suspend any of our laws, that cointravene its oppressive
operation; for they have the power of direct taxation,
which suspends our bill of rights; and it is expressly provided, that they can make all laws necessary for carryilng
their powers into execution; and it is declared paramount
to the laws and constitutions of the states.  Consider how
the only remaining defence we have left is destroyed in
this manner.  Besides the expenses of maintaining the
senate and other house in as much splendour as they please,
there is to be a great and mighty president, with very extensive powers--the powers of a king. He is to be supported in extravagant magnificence; so that the whole of
our property may be taken by this American governnment, by
laying what taxes they please, giving themselves what salaries they please, and suspending our laws at their pleasure.
I might be thought too inquisitive, but I believe I should
take up but very little of your time in enumerating the little
power that is left to the government of Virginia; for this
power is reduced to little or nothing. Their garrisons,
magazines, arsenals, and forts, whlich will be situated in the
strongest places within the states-their ten miles square,
with all the fine ornaments of human life, added to their
powers, and taken from the states, will reduce the power
of the latter to nothing.
The voice of tradition, I trust, will inform posterity of
our struggles for freedom. If our descendants be worthy
the name of Americans, they will preserve, and hand down
158to their latest posterity, the transactions of the present
times; and though I confess my exclamations are not worthy the hearing, they will see that I have done my utmost
to preserve their liberty: for I never will give up the power
of direct taxation, but for a scourge. I am willing to give it
conditionally; that is, after non-compliance with requisitions: I will do more, sir, and what I hope will convince
the most skeptical man, that I am a lover of the American
union; that in case Virginia shall not make punctual payment, the control of our.custom-houses, and the whole
regulation of trade, shall be given to congress; and that
Virginia shall depend on congress even for passports, till
Virginia shall lhave paid the last farthing, and furnished the
last soldier.
Nay, sir, there is another alternative to which I would consent; even that they should strike us out of the union, and
take away frorn us all federal privileges, till we comply with
federal requisitions; but let it depend upon our own pleasure
to pay our money in the most easy manner for our people.
Were all the states, more terrible than the mother country,
to join against us, I hope Virginia could defend herself;
but, sir, the dissolution of the union is most abhorrent to
my mind. The first thing I have at heart is American
liberty; the second thing is American union; and I hope
the people of Virginia will endeavour to preserve that union.
The increasing population of the Southern States is far
greater than that of New England; consequently, in a short
time, they will be far more numerous than the people of
that country.  Consider this, and you will find this state
more particularly interested to support American liberty,
and not bind our posterity by an improvident relinquishment of our rights. I would give the best security for a
punctual compliance with requisitions; but I beseech gentlemen, at all hazards, not to grant this unlimited power of
taxation.

deformities, it has an awful squintingr; it squints toward
monarchy:i and does not this raise indignation in the breast
of every true American? Your president may easily
become king. Your senate is so imperfectly constructed,
that your dearest rights may be sacrificed by what may be
a small minority;. and a very small minority may continue
for ever unchangeably this government, although horridly
defective. Where are your checks in this government?
Your strongholds will be in the hands of your enemies.
It is on a supposition that your.American governors shall
be honest, that all the good qualities of this government are
founded; but its defective and imperfect construction puts
it in their power to perpetrate the worst of mischief, should
they be bad men. And, sir, would not all the world, from
the eastern to the western hemisphere, blame our distracted
folly in resting our rights upon the contingency of our
rulers being good or bad?  Show me that age and country
where the rights and liberties of the people were placed
on the sole chance of their rulers being good men, without
a consequent loss of liberty. I say that the loss of that
dearest privilege has ever followed, with absolute certainty, every such mad attempt.
If your American chief be a man of ambition and abilities, how easy will it be for him to render himself absolute!
The army is in his hands, and, if he be a man of address,
it will be attached to him; and it will be the subject of
long meditation with him to seize the first auspicious moment to accomplish his design. And, sir, will the American spirit solely relieve you when this happens? I would
rather infinitely-and I am sure most of this convention are
of the same opinion-have a king, lords and commons, than
a government so replete with such insupportable evils. If
we make a king, we may prescribe the rules by which he
shall rule his people, and interpose such checks as shall
prevent him from infringing them; but the president in the
field, at the head of his army, can prescribe the terms on
which he shall reign master, so far that it will puzzle any
American ever to get his neck from under the galling
yoke.
I cannot, with patience, think of this idea. If ever he
violates the laws, one of two things will happen: he will
come at the head of his army to carry every thing before
160him; or, he will give bail, or do what Mr. Chief Justice
will order him. If he be guilty, will not the recollection
of his crimes teach him to make one bold push for the
American throne? Will not the immense difference between being master of every thing, and being ignominiously
tried and punished, powerfully excite him to make this
bold push? But, sir, where is the existing force to punish
him? Can he not, at thie head of his army, beat down
every opposition? Away with your president: we shall
have a king: the army will salute him monarch: your
militia will leave you, and assist in making him king, and
fight against you: and what have you to oppose this force?
What will then become of you and your rights? Will not
absolute despotism ensue?                    HENRY.

BEYOND Busaco's mountains dun,
When far had roll'd the sultry sun,
And night her pall of gloom had thrown
O'er nature's still convexity!
High on the heath our tents were spread,
The cold turf was our cheerless bed,
And o'er the hero's dew-chill'd head
The banners flapp'd incessantly.
The loud war-trumpet woke the morn
The quivering drum, the pealing horn,--
From rank to rank the cry is borne
"Arouse for death or victory!"
The orb of day, in crimson dye,
Began to mount the morning sky;
Then, what a scene for warrior's eye
Hung on the bold declivity!
The serried bayonets glittering stood,
Like icicles, on hills of blood;
An aerial stream, a silver wood,
Reel'd in the flickering canopy.

A thousand thousand thunders woke:

In phantom towers and columns high,
But dark and dense their bases lie,
Prone on the battle's boundary.

YOITNG.DIFFERENT METHODS BY WHICH THE PRINCIPLES AND
LESSONS MAY BE SUCCESSFULLY TAUGHT.
BEFOnE attempting to read the examples on inflections, a thorough
knowledge of the two slides, or inflections of voice, (page 17,) must be
obtained. Without a very accurate knowledge of these two slides of
the voice, no graceful progress in reading can possibly be made.
The Table of Inflections contains thirty lines. After being able to
exemplify the slides in the first column, proceed to acquire a like knowledge of the second. This being done, endeavour to read the table
backward; that is, read the 16th line, and then the 1st; the 17th, andl
then the 2d; the 18th, and then the 3d, &amp;c.; in the last place, read the
table across; that is, read the 1st line, and then the 16th; the 2d, and
-then the 17th; the 3d, and then the 18th, &amp;c.
Under the heads of Inflections, Accent, Emphasis, and Pauses, the
Rules are printed in Italics: these, it is understood, will be either attentively studied, or committed to memory by the pupil, according to circumstances. A single rule may be given out each day as an exercise;
the examples under which being read the day following.
The Notes and Examples under them may be read by the student
immediately after the rules to which they belong; but, by those less
advanced, they may be entirely passed over, and not read till a perfect
knowledge has been attaifed of what is of more importance.
In reading the Lessons, the principles should be gradually reduced
to practice. Words that require the rising inflection, may, by the
pupil, be marlied with a pencil with the acute accent; aid such as
require the falling inflection, with the grave accent. Emphatical words
may be marked by drawing a straight line over them; and where a
rhetorical pause is admissible, a mark, such as a comma, may be inserted after the word.
If this process should be thought too tedious, the pupil may be
requested to mark (while the teacher is reading the lesson) only the
principal inflections: it being always understood, however, that the
pupil has acquired a knowledge of the different slides, and degrees of
force of the voice.
The following Rule, to which, though there are many exceptions,
may perhaps be of some advantage; the knowledge of it, at least, is
easily acquired.
The falling inflection almost always takes place at a period, very often
at a colon, and frequently at a semicolon; at the comma immediately
preceding either of these points, the rising inflection commonly takes
place. When this rule does not hold good, the teacher can easily point
out the exceptions to it.
It must be carefully observed, that every falling, or every rising in
flection, does not -necessarily terminate updn the same key, or on the
same note of that key; neither is every emphatic word pronounced with
the same degree of force: for, as various as inflections and emphases are
in number, almost as varied should be the manner of pronouncing them.

63.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF EDMUND RANDOLPH ON
THE EXPEDIENCY OF ADOPTING THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, DELIVERED IN THE CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA, JUNE
6, 1788.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-I am a child of the revolution. My
country, very early indeed, took me under her protection, at
a time when I most wanted it, and by a succession of
favours and honours, prevented even my most ardent wishes.
I feel the highest gratitude and attachment to my country;
her felicity is the most fervent prayer of my heart. Conscious of having exerted my faculties to the utmost in her
behalf, if I have not succeeded in securing the esteem of
Iny countrymen, I shall reap abundant consolation from the
rectitude of my intentions: honours, when compared to the
satisfaction accruing from a conscious independence and
rectitude of conduct, are no equivalent. The unwearied
study of my life shall be to promote her happiness. As a
citizen, ambition and popularity are no objects with me.
I expect in the course of a year to retire to that private
station which I most sincerely and cordially prefer to all
others.
The security of public justice, sir, is what I most fervently wish-as I consider that object to be the primary
step to the attainment of public happiness. I can declare
to the whole world, that in the part I take in this very important question, I am actuated by a regard for what I conceive to be our true interest. I can also, with equal
sincerity, declare that I would join heart and hand in
rejecting this system, did I conceive it would promote our
happiness; but, having a strong conviction on my mind, at
this time, that, by a disunion, we shall throw away all
those blessings we have so earnestly fought for, and that a
rejection of the constitution will operate disunion-pardon

169THE AMERICAN SPEAKER
me if I discharge the obligation I owe to my country by
voting for its adoption.
We are told that the report of dangers is false. The
cry of peace, sir, is false: say peace, when there is
peace: it is but a sudden calm.'The tempest growls
over you-look around-wheresoever you look, you see
danger. Whlen there are so many witnesses, in many parts
of America, that justice is suffocated, shall peace and happiness still be said to reign?  Candour, sir, requires an
undisguised representation of our situation. Candour, sir,
demands a faithful exposition of facts. Many citizens have
found justice strangled and -trampled under foot, through
the course of jurisprudence in this country. Are those,
who have debts due them, satisfied with your governmnent?
Are not creditors wearied with the tedious procrastination
of your legal process-a process obscured by legislative
mists?  Cast your eyes to your seaports-see how commerce languishes: this country, so blessed, by nature,
with every advantage that call render commerce profitable,
through defective legislation, is deprived of all the benefits
and emoluments she might otherwise reap from it.
We hear many complaints on the subject of located lands
-a variety of competitors claiming the same lands under
legislative acts-public faith prostrated, and private confidence destroyed. I ask you if your laws are reverenced.
in every well-regulated community, the laws command
respect. Are yours entitled to reverence? We not only
see violations of the constitution, but of national principles
in repeated instances. How is the fact? The history of
the violations of the constitution extends from the year
1776 to this present time-violations made by formal acts
of the legislature: every thing has been drawn within the
legislative vortex. There is one example of this violation
in Virginia, of a most striking and shocking nature; an
example so horrid, that if I conceived my country would
passively permit a repetition of it, dear as it is to me, I
would seek means of expatriating myself from it.
64.-SECOND EXTRACT FROM THE SAME.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-I am sorry to be obliged to detain the
-house; but the relat.on of a variety of matter renders it
170now unavoi(lable.  I informed the house yesterday, before
rising, that I intended to show the necessity of having a
national government, in preference to the confederation;
also, to show the necessity of conceding the power of taxation, and of distinguishing between its objects; anti I am
the more lhappy, that I possess materials of information for
that purpose.  My intention then is, to satisfy the gentlemen of tlhis committee, that a national government is absolutely indispensable, and that a confederacy is not eligible,
in our present situation. The introductory step to this
will be, to endeavour to convince the house of the necessity
of the union, and that the present confederation is actually
inadequate, and unamendable.
The extent of the country is objected to, by the gentleman over the way, as an insurmountable obstacle to the
establishing a national government in the Uniited States.
It is a very strange and inconsistent doctrine, to admit thle
necessity of the union, and yet urge this last objection,
which I think goes radically to the existence of the union
itself. If the extent of the country be a conclusive argument against a national government, it is equally so against
a union with the other states. Instead of eintering largely
into a discussion of the nature and effect of the different
kinds of government, or into an inquiry into a particular
extent of country, that may suit the genius of this or
that government, I ask this qnestion-Is this government
necessary for the safety of Virginia? Is the union indispensable for our happiness?
I confess it is imnprudent for any nation to form alliance
with another, whose situation and construction of government are dissimilar with its own.  It is impolitic and improper for men of opulence to join their interest with
men of indigence and chance. But we are now inquiring,
particularly, whether Virginia, as contradistinguished from
the other states, canl exist without the union--a hard question, perhaps, after what has been said. I will venture,
however, to say, she cannot. I shall not rest contented
with asserting--I shall endeavour to prove.
Look at the most powerful nations on earth.  England
and France have had recourse to this expedient. Those
countries found it necessary to unite with their immediate
neighbotirs, and this union has prevented the most lament
171
RANDOLPII.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
able mnischiefs. What divine pre-eminence is Virginia possessed of, above other states? Can Virginia send her navv
and thunder, to bid defiance to foreign nations? And can
she exist without a union with her neighbours, when the
most potent nations have found such a union necessary,
not only to their political felicity, but their national'existence?  Let us examine her ability. Although it be impossible to determine, with accuracy, what degree of internal strength a nation ought to possess, to enable it to stand
by itself; yet there are certain sure facts and circumstances,
which demonstrate, that a particular nation cannot stand
singly. I have spoken with freedom, and I trust I have
done it with decency; but I must also speak with truth. If
Virginia can exist without the union, she must derive that
ability from one or other of these sources, viz. from her
natural situation, or because she has no reason to fear from
other nations.
What is her situation? She is not inaccessible.  She is
not a petty republic, like that of St. Marino, surrounded
with rocks and mountains, with a soil not very fertile, nor
worthy the envy of surrounding nations. Were this, sir,
her situation, she might, like that petty state, subsist separated from the world. On the contrary, she is very accessible: the large capacious bay of Chesapeake, which is but
too excellently adapted for the admission of enemies, renders her very vulnerable. I am informed, and I believe
rightly, because I derive my information from those whose
knowledge is most respectable, that Virginia is in a very
unhappy position, with respect to the access of foes by sea,
though happily situated for commerce.
This being her situation by sea, let us look at land.
She has frontiers adjoining the states of Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and North Carolina. T'I'wo of those states have
declared themselves members of the union. Will she be
inaccessible to the inhabitants of those states? Cast your
eyes to the western country, that is inhabited by cruel
savages, your natural enemies. Besides their natural pro.
pensity to barbarity, they may be excited, by the gold of
foreign enemies, to commit the most horrid ravages on your
people. Our great, increasing population is one remedy
to this evil; but, being scattered thinly over so extensive a
172country, how difficult it is to collect their strength, or
defend the country  
Will the American spirit, so much spoken of, repel an
invading enemy, or enable you to obtain an advantageous
peace? Manufactures and military stores may afford relief
to a country exposed: have we these at present? Attempts
have been made to have these here. If we shall be separated from the union, shall our chance of having these be
greater? Or will not the want of these be more deplorable? We shall be told of the exertions of Virginia, under
the confederation-her achievements, wlhen she had no
commerce. These, sir, were necessary for her imnlediate
safety; nor would these have availed, without the aid of
the other states. Those states, then our friends, brothers,
and supporters, will, if disunited from us, be our bitterest
enemies.
If then, sir, Virginia, from her situation, is not inaccessible, or invulnerable, let us consider if she be protected,
by having no cause to fear from other nations: has she no
cause to fear?  You will have cause to fear as a nation, if
disunited; you will not onily have this cause to fear from
yourselves, from that species of population I before mentioned, and your once sister states, but from the arms of other
nations.  Have you no cause of fear from Spain, whose
dominions border on your country? Every nation, every
people, in our circumstances, has always had abundant
cause to fear.
Let us see the danger to be apprehended from France:
let us suppose Virginia separated from the other states: as
part of the former confederated states, she will owe France
a very considerable sum-France will be as magnanimous
as ever. France, by the law of nations, will have a right
to demand the whole of her, or of the others. If France
were to demand it, what would become of the property of
America?  Could she not destroy what little commerce we
have? Could she not seize our ships, and carry havoc and
(lestruction before her on our shores? The most lamentable desolation would take place. We owe a debt to Spain
also; do we expect indulgence from that quarter? That
nation has a right to demand the debt due to it, and power
to enforce that right. Will the Dutch be silent about the
15'

173THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
debt due to them? Is there any one pretension, that any
of these nations will be patient.
The debts due the British are also very considerable:
these debts lhave been withheld contrary to treaty: if Great
Britain will (lemand the payment of these debts, peremptorily, what will be the consequence? Can we pay them if
demanded? Will no danger result from a refusal? Will
the British nation suffer their subjects to be stripped of
their property? Is not that nation amply able to do its
subjects justice? Will the resentment of that powerful
and supercilious nation sleep for ever? If we become one,
sole nation, uniting with our sister states, our means of
defence will be greater; the indulgence for the paymenit of
those debts will be greater, and the danger of an attack less
probable. Moreover, vast quantities of land have been
sold, by citizens of this country, to Europeans, and these
lands cannot be found. Will this frau(d be countenanced
or endured? Among so many causes of danger, shall we
be secure, separated from our sister states? Weakness
itself, sir, will invite some attack upon your country.
Contemplate our situation deliberately, and consult history: it will inform you, that people in our circumstances
have ever been attacked and successfully: open any page,
and you will there find our danger truly depicted. If such a
people had any thing, was it not taken? The fate which
will befall us, I fear, sir, will be, that we shall be made a
partition of. How will these our troubles be removed? Can
we have any dependence on commerce? Can we make
any computation on this subject? Where will our flag
appear? So high is the spirit of commercial nations, that
they will spend five times the value of the object, to exclude
their rivals from a participation in commercial profits:
they seldom regard any expenses.
If we should be divided from the rest of the states, upon
what footing would our navigation in the Mississippi be?
What would be the probable conduct of France and Spain t
Every gentleman may imagine, in his own mind, the natural consequences. To these considerations I might add
many others of a similar nature. Were I to say, that the
boundary between us and North Carolina is not yet settled,
I should be told, that Virginia and that state go together.
174But what, sir, will be the consequence of the dispute that
may arise between us and Maryland, on the subject of
Potomac river? It is thought Virginia has a right to
an equal navigation with themn in that river. If ever it
should be decided on grounds of prior riglit, their charter
will inevitably determine it in their favour. The couiitry
called the Northern Neck will probably be severed from
Virginia. There is not a doubt but the inhabitants of that
part will annex themselves to Maryland, if Virginia refuses
to accede to the union. The recent exaimple of those
regulations, lately made respecting that territory, will illustrate that probability. Virginia will also be in danger of a
conflict with Pennsylvania, on the subject of boundaries. I
know that some gentlemen are thoroughly persuaded, that
we have a right to those disputed boundaries: if we have
such a right, I know not where it is to be found.
Are we not borderers on states that will be separated
from us? Call to mind the history of every part of the
world, where nations have bordered on one another, and
consider the cdnsequences of our separation from the union.
Peruse those histories, and you find such countries to
have ever, been almost a perpetual scene of bloodshed
and slaughter. The inhabitants of one, escaping from
punishment into the other-protection given them--consequent pursuit, robbery, cruelty, and murder. A numerous
standing army, that dangerous expedient, would be necessary, but not sufficient for the defence of such borders.
Every gentleman will amplify the scene in his own mind.
If you wish to know the extent of such a scene, look at
the history of England and Scotland before the union; you
will see their borderers continually committing depredations and cruelties, of the most calamitous and deplorable
nature, on one another.
65.-THIRD EXTRACT FROM THE SAME.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-I am afraid I have tired the patience
of this house; but I trust you will pardon me, as I was
urged by the importunity of the gentleman in calling for the
reasoiis of laying the groundwork of this plan.  It is
objected by the honourable gentleman over the way, (Mr
175
RANDOLPII..'rIE AMlERICAN SPEAKElR.
George Mason,) that a republican government is impracticable in an extensive territory, and the extent of the United
States is urged as a reason for the rejection of this constitution.
Let us consider the definition of a republican government as
laid down by a man who is highly esteemed. Montesquieu,
so celebrated among politicians, says,'" that a republican
government is that in which the body, or only a part of the
people, is possessed of the supreme power; a monarchical,
that in which a single person governs, by fixed and established laws; a despotic government, that in which a single
person, without law and without rule, directs every thing
by his own will and caprice."  This author has not distinguished a republican government from a monarchy by the
extent of its boundaries, but by the nature of its principles.
He, in another place, contradistinguishes it, as a government of laws, in opposition to others, which he denominates
a government of men.
The empire, or government of laws, according to that
phrase, is that in which the laws are made with the free
will of the people; hence, then, if laws be made by the
assent of the people, the government may be deemed free.
When laws are made with integrity, and executed with
wisdom, the question is, whether a great extent of country
will tend to abridge the liberty of the people. If defensive
force be necessary, in proportion to the extent of country,
I conceive that, in a judiciously-constructed government, be
the country ever so extensive, its inhabitants will be proportionably numerous, and able to defend it. Extent of
country, in my conception, ought to be Ino bar to the adoption of a good government. No extent on earth seems to me
too great, provided the laws be wisely made and executed.
rhe principles of representation and responsibility may
pervade a large as well as a small territory: and tyranny
is as easily introduced into a small as into a large district.
If it be answered, that somne of the most illustrious and distinguished authors are of a contrary opinion, I reply, that
authority has no weight with me, till I am convinced that
not the dignity of names, but the force of reasoning, gains
my assent.
I intended to have shown the nature of the powers which
ought to have been given to the general government, and
the reason of investing it with the power of taxation; but
176this would require more time. than my strength or the
patience of the committee would now admit of. I shall
conclude with a few observations, which come from my
heart. I have laboured for the continuance of the unionthe rock of our salvation. I believe that as sure as there is
a God in heaven, our safety, our political happiness and
existence, depend on the union of the states; and that,
without this union, the people of this and the other states
will undergo the unspeakable calamities which discord,
faction, turbulence, war, and bloodshed have produced in
other countries.
The American spirit ought to be mixed with Aimerican
pride-pride to see the union magnificently triumph. I,et
that glorious pride which once defied the Britishl thunder,
reanimate you again. Let it not be recorded of Americans,
that, after having performed the most gallant exploits, after
having overcome the most astonishing difficulties, and after
having gained the admiration of the world by their incomparable valour and policy, they lost their:Irquired reputation, their national consequence and l-happiness, by their
own indiscretion. Let no future historian inform posterity
that they wanted wisdom and virtue to concur in any
regular, efficient government. Should any writer, doomed
to so disagreeable a task, feel the indignation of an honest
historian, he would reprehend and recriininate our folly
with equal severity and justice.
Catch the present moment; seize it with avidity and
eagerness; for it may be lost, never to be regained. If the
union be now lost, I fear it will remain so for ever.  I believe gentlemen are sincere in their opposition, and actuated
by pure motives; but when I maturely weigh the advantages of the union, and dreadful consequences of its dissolution; when I see safety on my right, and destruction on
my left; when I behold respectability and happiness acquired by the one, but annihilated by the other,-I cannot
hesitate to decide in favour of the former. I hope my
weakness, from speaking so long, will apologize for my
leaving this subject in so mutilated a condition. If a fuIrther
explanation be desired, I shall take the liberty to enter into
it more fully another time.
177
RANDOLPH.In these, however, and in many other circumstances, whereon the'beauty
of reading and speaking chiefly depends, the import of the su',;--t, the
nature of the audience, and the place the speaker occupies, must all be
judiciously considered, in order properly to regulate his pronunciatica
and delivery.
GENERAL RULES AND OBSERVATIONS ON READING AND
RECITATION.
1. G-ive the letters their proper sounds.
2. Pronounce the vowels, a, e, i, o, u, clearly, giving to each its proper
quantity.
3. The liquids, 1, m, n, should be pronounced with a considerable
degree of force.
4. Distinguish every accented letter or syllable by a peculiar stress of
the voice.
5. Read audibly and distinctly, with a degree of deliberation suited to
the subject.
6. Pause at the points a sufficient length of time; but not so long as
to break that connexion which one part of a sentence has with
another.
7. The meaning of a sentence is often considerably elucidated by
pausing where none of the usual marks could properly be
inserted.
8. Give every sentence, and member of a sentence, that inflection of
voice which tends to improve either the sound or the sense.
9. Monotones, judiciously introduced, have a wonderful effect in
diversifying delivery.
10. Every emphatical word must be marked with a force corresponding
with the importance of the subject.
11. At the beginning of a subject or discourse, the pitch of the voice
should, in general, be low: to this rule, however, there are some
exceptions in poetry, and even in prose.
12. As the speaker proceeds, the tones of his voice should swell, and
his animation increase with the increasing importance of his
subject.
13. At the commencement of a new paragraph, division, or subdivision
of a discourse, the voice may be lowered, and again allowed
gradually to swell.
14. The tones of the voice must, in every instance, be regulated entirely
by the nature of the subject.
15. In recitation, the speaker must adopt those tones, looks, and gestures, which are most agreeable to the nature of whatever he
delivers:--he must " suit the action to the word, and the word
to the action:" always remembering, that "rightly to seem, is
transiently to be."

Ah! whence is the flame which now bursts on his eye?
Ah! what is that sound that now larums his ear?'Tis the lightning's red glare painting hell on the sky!'Tis the crashing of thunders, the groan of the sphere!
He springs from his hammock--he flies to the deck;
Amazement confronts him with images dire;Wild winds and mad waves drive the vessel a wreck,
The masts fly in splinters-the shrouds are onl fire!
Like mountains the billows tumultuously swell,
In vain the lost wretch calls on mercy to save;Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell,
And the death-angel flaps his broad wings o'er the wave.
O, sailor boy! wo to thy dream of delight!
In darkness dissolves the gay frost-work of bliss;Where now is the picture that fancy touch'd bright,
Thy parent's fond pressure, and love's honey'd kiss?
O! sailor boy! sailor boy! never again
Shall home, love, or kindred thy wishes repay;
Unbless'd and unhonour'd, down deep in the main,
Full many a score fathom, thy frame shall decay.
No tomb shall e'er plead to remembrance for thee,
Or redeem form or frame from the merciless surge;
But the white foam of waves shall thy winding-sheet be,
And winds in the midnight of winter thy dirge.
On beds of green sea-flower thy limbs shall be laid,
Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow;
Of thy fair yellow locks threads of amber be made,
And every part suit to thy mansion below.
Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away,
And still the vast waters above thee shall roll;
Earth loses thy pattern for ever and aye0, sailor boy! sailor boy! peace to thy soul  
DIMOND.69.-THE AMERICAN PATRIOT'S SONG.
IARK! hear ye the sounds that the winds on their pinions
Exultingly roll from the shore to the sea,
With a voice that resounds through her boundless dominions?'Tis Columbia calls on her sons to be free!
Behold on yon summits where Heaven has throned her,
How she starts from her proud inaccessible seat;
With nature's inlpregnable ramparts around her,
And the cataract's thunder and foam at her feet!
In the breeze of her mountains her loose locks are shaken,
While the soul-stirring notes of her warrior- song
From the rock to the valley re-echo, " Awaken,
Awaken, ye hearts that have slumber'd too long!"
Yes, despots! too long did your tyranny hold us,
In a vassalage vile, ere its weakness was known;
Till we learn'd that the links of the chain that controll'd us
Were forged by the fears of its captives alone.
That spell is destroy'd, and no longer availing,
Despised as detested-pause well ere ye dare
To cope with a people whose spirits and feeling
Are roused by remembrance and steel'd by despair.
Go tame the wild torrent, or stemn with a straw
The proud surges that sweep o'er the strand that confines
them,
But presume not again to give freemen a law,
Nor think with the chains they have broken to bind them.
To hearts that the spirit of liberty flushes,
Resistance is idle,-and numbers a dream;They burst from control, as the mountain stream rushes
From its fetters of ice, in the warmth of the beam.

70. -LOCHINVAR.
O, YOUNG Lochinvar is come out of the West,
Through all the wide border his steed was the best;
And save his good broad sword he weapon had none,
He rode all unarm'd, and he rode all alone.
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
10
-81SCOTT.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
He stayed not for brake, and he stopp'd not for stone,
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
But, ere he alighted at Netherby gate,
The bride had consented, the gallant came late:
For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
So boldly he enter'd the Netherby hall,
Among bride's-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,
(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)
" O0 come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"
" I long woo'd your daughter, my suit you denied;Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide--
And now am I come with this lost love of mine,
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar."
The bride kiss'd the goblet; the knight took it up,
He quaff'd off the w;ine, and he threw down the cup.
She look'd down to blush, and she look'd up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.
He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar," Now tread we a measure!" said young Lochinvar.
So stately his form, and so lovely her face,
Trhat never a hall such a galliard did grace;
While her mother did fret and her father did fume,
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
And the bridemaidens whisper'd, "'Twere better by far
To have match'd our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."
One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,
When they reach'd the hall door, and the charger stood near;
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,
So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
" She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;
They'll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth young Lochinvar.
Trhere was mounting'mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;
Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode, and they
ran;
182There was racing, and chasing, on Cannobie Lee,
But the lost bride of Netherby ne'er did they see.
So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,
Have ye e'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?
SIR WV. SCOTT.
71.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF ROBERT G. HARPER, ON
THE NECESSITY OF RESISTING THE AGGRESSIONS AND
ENCROACHMENTS OF FRANCE, DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES, MAY 29, 1797.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-It being, as I conceive, perfectly manifest from all these considerations, that the plan of France
has always been to draw us into the war; the house is
furnished with a ready solution of her anger against the
British treaty, and a clue to all her present measures. It
is evident, that her anger at the treaty has arisen entirely
from its having defeated her plan of drawing us into the
war; and it will readily appear, that the whole aim and object
of her present measures are to compel us to renounce it; to
drive us into that quarrel with England, into which she has
failed in her attempts to entice us. She must either mean this,
or she must mean seriously to attack us, and drive us into
a war against herself. To discover which of these is her
real object, what is the true motive of her present measures,
is of the utmost importance; because till that is done, it
will be difficult to determine in what manner those measures ought to be counteracted, which is the point immediately under consideration. I can never believe that it is the
intention of France seriously to attack this country, or to
drive it into a war against herself. She has too much to
lose and too little to gain by such a contest, to have seriously resolved on it, or even to wish it. In her counsels I
have observed great wickedness, but no folly; and it would
be the extreme of folly in her to compel this country to
become her enemy; especially in the present war, when
we can throw so formidable a weight into the opposite
scale.
France well knows our power in that respect, and
will not compel us to exert it. She well knows that we
possess more ships and more seamen than any country
upon earth, except England alone. She well knows that
183
SCOTT-- HAKPER.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
our sailors are the most brave, skilful, and enterprising in
the world, and, that by arming our vessels, our commerce
would soon be made to float safe from privateers; while her
fleets and large ships would be kept in awe by those of
England. She knows that in the late war the state of Massachusetts alone with its privateers took one-third of all the
merchant ships of Great Britain; and that, though she had no
commerce to be attacked, these maritime materials, greatly
increased since that time, would enable us, if driven to the
necessity, to create speedily a formidable marine, with
which we could not only defend ourselves, but attack her
possessions. She knows that we have a population not
far short of six millions, and that the martial spirit, which
conducted us gloriously through the trying scenes of the
late war, though dormant indeed, could not have been
extinguished. She knows that by co-operating with the
English, (a co-operation which must result naturally from
our being driven into the war,) by opening our harbours to
their ships, permitting them to arm, refit, and victual in our
ports, to recruit among our seamen, and to employ our
vessels as transports, we could give them a most decided
preponderance in the American seas, under which her own
colonies, and those of Spain and Holland, which she most
justly considers as her own, must speedily fall.
She knows, that in case of a war with us, Spain and
Holland, who must be her allies, would be within our
grasp. She knows that the Americans could and would lay
hold of New Orleans and the Floridas, and that they are
well acquainted with the road to Mexico; and she would
dread that enterprising valour which formerly led them,
through barren wilds and frozen mountains, to the walls of
Quebec. She knows, in fine, that to drive this country
into a war with her at the present juncture, would bring
about that co-operation of means, and that union of interests and views, between us and the English, which it has
been the great object of her policy to prevent, and which
she had undertaken two wars, in the course of half a century,
for the sole and express purpose of breaking. It is, therefore, I think, impossible to conceive, that France means to
drive or provoke us into war.
Her object, in my opinion, must be altogether different.
It must be to compel us to renounce the British treaty, and
18-4renew all our differences with that nation, under ciircumstances of irritation which must speedily end in a rupture.
What has led her to form this project? From whence could
she derive hopes of success? She has been led to form it,
in my opinion, from a persuasion, erroneous indeed, but
favoured by many appearances, that we are a weak, pusillanimous people, too much devoted to gain to regard our
honour, too careful about our property to risk it in support of our rights, too much divided to exert our strength,
too distrustful of our own government to defend it, too
much devoted to her to repel her aggressions at the risk of
a quarrel, too much exasperated against England to consent
to that co-operation which must of necessity grow out of
resistance to France.
Various occurrences have combined to produce and confirm this persuasion, and the forbearance, which our government has exercised toward herself, is not the least of them.
She has seen us submit, with patience, to the insults and
outrages of three successive ministers, for the very least of
which, she would have sent the minister of any nation out
of her country, if not to the guillotine. The minister of
the grand-duke of Tuscany, with whom France had recently concluded a treaty, learning that the daughter of Louis
the Sixteenth was to be sent out of the country, requested
permission to pay her a visit. This request to visit an unfortunate young lady, the near relation of his sovereign, and
whose tender age, no less than her sex, her virtues, and her
calamities, entitled her to respect, was answered by all order
from the directory, to quit the territories of the republic.
His expression of a wish to show one mark of regard to
virtuous misfortune and suffering innocence, was considered
as an affront by the government of France, and punished by
the instant distmissal of the minister. Accustomed to act
thus herself, how can she impute our long-suffering and
forbearance, under the perpetual insolence and insults of
her ministers, to any thing but weakness, pusillanimity, or
a blind devotedness to herself? The conduct'of gentlemen
on this floor, too, has more and more confirmed her in this
injurious opinion of us; has confirmed her in the erroneous
persuasion, that there is a party, in the very bosom of the
government, devoted to her interests.
I do not mean to charge gentlemen with acting under
16*

HARPER.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
French influence. I am persuaded that, in the course they
have taken, they believed themselves to be aiming at the
good of their country, which they supposed might best be
promoted in the manner recommended by them. But I
would ask those gentlemen, and I solemnly call on them to
lay their hands on their hearts and answer me-I would
ask them whether the course of conduct which they have
pursued, is not calculated to impress France with a belief,
that they are devoted to her interests, and not to those of
their own country?'Whether the manner in which they
have alwavs connected the interests and wishes of France
with their opposition to the measures of this government,
does not necessarily tend to create and confirm this belief?
When she saw them constantly making it a ground of
opposition to measures, that they would be hurtful or
displeasing to her; constantly supporting those plans
which she was desirous of seeing adopted; constantly
opposing all that she opposed; what could she infer,
but that they were a party devoted to her views? As
she knows their numbers and importance, and has these
apparently strong reasons for relying on their attachment,
what can she conclude, but that, however unable they may
be to direct the government according to her wishes,
they will be ready and able so to clog its operations, as to
prevent it from adopting or pursuing vigorous measures
against her? She no doubt does believe, and there is
eviden.ce of the fact from the most respectable quarter, our
minister in that country, that she has nothing to do but
press hard on the government, in order to lay it, bound
hand and foot, at the feet of this party, by means of which
she might then govern the country. She is further confirmed
in this belief by the conduct of the people of this country,
by their warm partiality for her cause and her nation, by
their enthusiastic exultation in her victories, and the fond,
sympathizing sorrow witli which they mourn her disasters.
Mistaking, the source of these generous emotions, she has
seen in them nothing but the proof of a slavish devotedness
to herself, which would render this people incapable of
asserting their own rights, when it must be done at the risk
of her displeasure. She does not know, nor can she be
made to understand, that it is the cause of liberty in which
she is thought to be struggling, that inspires this enthusiasm
186and that, should she change her conduct, and abandon tlle
principles which she professes, these generous well-wishers
would be found among the firmest of her opposers. A.
similar mistake she committed with respect to England, and
that mistake further confirmed her original error. She saw
much resentment excited by the attacks and outrages of
England, and she supposed that resentment to be deeprooted and durable. She did not know, and could not conceive, that, when England had given up her injurious pretensions for the future, and agreed to make a fair and just
compensation for the past, we should forget our resentments, and cherish sentiments of mutual and friendly
intercourse. She supposed these resentments to be far
more deeply rooted, more universal, and more permanent
than they really are, and relies on them as a certain means
of preventing any union of interest and operations between
us and England, however recommended by policy or even
required by necessity.
In all these delusions she is confirmed by the conduct, the
speeches, and the writings of persons in this country, both
our own citizens and hers; by the information and opinions of some of her citizens, who, having resided here,
have carried home with them those erroneous opinions
which foreigners generally form about countries they visit;
and it is to be feared by the behaviour too of some of our
citizens in her own country, who, forgetting the trust
reposed in them, and the situations in which they were
placed, allowed themselves to pursue a course of conduct
and conversation, calculated to confirm France in all her
unfounded and injurious opinions respecting this country.
Supposing, therefore, that the people of this country are
unwilling to oppose her, and the government unable; that
we should prefer peace with submission, to the risk of
war; that a strong party devoted to her will hang on the
government, and impede all its measures of reaction; and
that, if she should place us by her aggressions in a situation
where the choice should seem to lie between a war with
England and a war with her, our hatred to England, joined
to those other causes, would force us to take the former
part of the alternative; she has resolved on the measures
which she is now pursuing, and the object of which is to
malie us renounce the treaty with England, and enter into

a quarrel with that nation: in fine, to effect, by force and
aggressions, that which she had attempted in vain by four
years of intriguing and insidious policy.
If such are her objects, how was she to be induced to
renounce them? By trifling concessions of this, that, or
the other article of a treaty; this, that, or the otlier advantage in trade?-No. It seems to me a delusion equally
fatal and unaccountable, to suppose that she is to be tlius
satisfied: to suppose that, by these inconsiderable favours,
which she has not even asked for, she is to be bought off
from a plan so great and important. It seems to me the
most fatal and unaccountable delusion, that can nmake gentlemen shut their eyes to this testimony of every nation, to
this glare of light bursting in from every side; that cai
render them blind to the projects of France, to the Herculeail strides of her overtowering ambition, which so evidently aims at nothing less than the establishment of universal empire, or universal influence, and has fixed on this
country as one of the instruments for accomplishing her
plan.
It is against this dangerous delusion that I wish to warn
the house and the country. I wish to warn them not to
deceive themselves with the vain and fallacious expectation,
that the concessions proposed by this amendment will satisfy the wishes or arrest the measures of France. Do I
dissuade you from these concessions? Far from it, I wish
them to be offered, and in the way the most likely to give
weight to the offer. It is a bridge which I am willing to
build, for the pride of France to retreat over; but what I
wish to warn the house against, is the resting satisfied with
building the bridge, to the neglect of those measures by
which France may be induced to march over it, after it
shall be built. I wish to negotiate, and I even rely much
on success; but the success of the negotiation must be
secured on this floor. It must be secured by adopting firm
language and energetic measures; measures which will
convince France, that those opinions respecting this country, on which her system is founded, are wholly erroneous;
that we are neither a weak, a pusillanirnous, or a divided
people; that we are not disposed to barter honour for quiet,
nor to save our money at the expense of our rigllts: which
will convince lier, that we understood her projects, and are
188determined to oppose them, with all our resources, and at
the hazard of all our possessions.  This, I believe, is. t-he
way to ensure success to the negotiation; and without this
I shall consider it as a measure equally vain, weali, and
delusive.
When France shall at lengthl be convinced that we are
firmly resolved to call forth all our resources, and exert all
our strength, to resist her encroachments and aggressions,
she will soon desist from  them. She need not be told
what these resources are; she well knows their greatness
and extent; she well knows that this country, if driven
into a war, could soon become invulnerable to her attacks,
and could throw a most formidable and preponderating
weight inlto the scale of her adversary. She will not,
therefore, drive us to this extremity, but will desist as soon
as she finds us determined.  I have already touchedbon
our means of injuring France, and of repelling her attacks;
and if those means were less than they are, still they might
be rendered all-sufficient, by resolution and courage. It is
in these that the strength of nations consists, and not in
fleets, nor armies, nor population, nor money: in the " urnconquerable will--the courage never to submit or yield."
These are the true sources of national greatness; and to
use the words of a celebrated writer,- "where these
means are not wanting, all others will be found or created."
It was by these means that Holland, in the days of her
glory, triumphed over the mighty power of Spain. It is
by these, that in latter times, and in the course of the present war, the Swiss, a people not half so numerous as we,
and possessing few of our advantages, have honourably
maintained their neutrality amid the shock of surrounding
states, and against the haughty aggressions of France herself. The Swiss have not been without their trials. They
had given reftlge to many French emigrants, whom their
vengeful and implacable country had driven and pursued
from state to state, and whom it wished to deprive of their
last asylum in the mountains of Switzerland. The Swiss
were required to drive them away, under the pretence that
to afford them a retreat was contrary to the laws of neutrality.
They at first temporized and evaded the demand: France
insisted; and finding at length that evasion was useless,
they assumed a firm attitude, and declared that having
189
HIARPER.T-THE AMIERICAN SPEAKER.
afforded an asylum to those unfortunate exiles, which no
law of neutrality forbade, they would protect them in it at
every hazard.  France, finding them thus resolved, gave
up the attempt.''his was effected by that determined courage which alone can make a nation great or respectable:
and this effect has invariably been produced by the same
cause in every age and every clime. It was tlhis that made
Rome the mistress of the world, and Atliens the protectress
of Greece. When was it that Rome attracted most strongly
the admiration of mankind, and impressed the deepest sentiment of fear on the hearts of her enemies? It was when
seventy thousand of her sons lay bleeding at Canne, and
Hannibal, victorious over three Roman armies and twenty
nations, was thundering at her gates.  It was then that
the young and heroic Scipio, having sworn on his sword,
in ttie presence of the fathers of the country, not to despair
of the republic, marched forth at the head of a people firmly resolved to conquer or die: and that resolution ensured
them the victory. When did Athens appear the greatest
and the most formidable? It was when giving up their
houses and possessions to the flames of the enemy, and
having transferred their wives, their children, their aged
parents, and the symbols of their religion, on board of their
fleet, they resolved to consider themselves as the republic,
and their ships as their country. It was then they struck
that terrible blow, under which the greatness-of Persia sunk
and expired.
These means, sir, and many others are in our power.
Let us resolve to use them, and act so as to convince France
that we have taken the resolution, and there is nothing to
fear. This conviction will be to us instead of fleets and
armies, and even more effectual. Seeing us thus prepared,
she will not attack us. Then will she listen to our peaceable proposals; then will she accept the concessions we
mean to offer. But should this offer not be thus supported,
should it be attended by any circumstances from which she
can discover weakness, distrust, or division, then will she
reject it with derision and scorn. I view in the proposed
amendment circumstances of this kind; and for that, among
other reasons, shall vote against it. I shall vote against it, not
because I am for war, but because I am for peace; and because
I see in this amendment itself, and more especially in the

NOT a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O'er the grave where our hero we buried.
192We buried him darkly at dead of night,
The sods with our bayonets turning,
By the struggling moonbeam's misty light,
And the lantern dimly burning.
No useless coffin enclosed his breast,
Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;
But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,
With his martial cloak around him.
Few and short were the prayers we said,
And we spoke not a word, of sorrow;
But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,
And we bitterly thought of the morrow.
We thought, as we hollow'd his narrow bed,
And smooth'd down his lonely pillow,
That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,
And we far away on the billow!
Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,
And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him,But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on
In the grave where a Briton has laid him.
But half of our heavy task was done,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring;
And we heard the distant and random gun
That the foe was sullenly firing.
Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame fresh and gory;
We carved not a line, and we raised not a stoneBut we left him alone with his glory!  WOLFE.

0! how our hearts were beating, when at the dawn of day,
We saw the army of the League drawn out in long array;
With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers,
AndAppenzel's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears.
There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our
land;
An d dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand:
And, as we look'd on them, we thought of Seine's impurpled flood,
And good Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;
And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of
war,
To fight for his own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.
The king is come to marshal us, in all his armour drest,
And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant
crest.
He look'd upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;
IHe look'd upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and
high.
Right graciously he smiled on us, as roll'd from wing to
wing,
Down all our line, a deafening shout, "God save our lord
the king!"
" And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may,
For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray,
Press where ye see my white plume shine, amid the
ranks of war,:And be your Oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre."
Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to tile mingled din
Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin.
The fiery duke is pricking fast across Saint Andre's plain,
With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.
194THE AMERICAN SPEAKElR.             195
Now by the lips of those who love, fair gentlemen of France,
Charge for the golden lilies-upon them with the lance.
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in
rest,
A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snowwhite crest;
And in they burst, and on they rush'd, while like a guiding
star,
Amid the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.
Now, God be praised, the day is ours. Mayenne hati
turn'd his rein.
D'Aumale hath cried for quarter. The Flemish count is
slain.
Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay
gale;
The field is heap'd with bleeding steeds, and flags, and
cloven mail.
And then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van,
"Remember St. Bartholomew," was pass'd from man to
man.
But out spake gentle Henry, " No Frenchman is my foe:
Down, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go."
0! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,
As our sovereign lord, King Henry, the soldier of Navarre!
Ho! maidens of Vienna; ho! matrons of Lucerne;
Weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who. never shall
return.
Ho! Philip, send for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,
That Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen's souls.
Ho! gallant nobles of the League, look that your arms be
bright;
Ho! burghers of Saint Genevieve, keep watch and ward
to-night.
For our God hath crush'd the tyrant, our God hath raised
the slave,
And mock'd the counsel of the wise, and the valour of the
brave.
Then glory to his holy Name, from whom all glories are;
And glory to our sovereign lord, King Henry of NavarreTHE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
75.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF JAMES A. BAYARD, ON
THE JUDICIARY ACT, DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES, FEBRUARY 19, 1802.
MR. CHAIRMAN,--The morals of your people, the peace
of the country, the stability of the government, rest upon
the maintenance of the independence of the judiciary. It
is not of half the importance in England that the judges
should be independent of the crown, as it is with us, that
they should be independent of the legislature. Am I
asked, Would you render the judges superior to the legislature? I answer, no, but co-ordinate. Would you render
them independent of the legislature? I answer, yes, independent of every power on earth, while they behave themselves well. The essential interests, the permanent welfare of society, require this independence; not, sir, on
account of the judge; that is a small consideration; but on
account of those between whom he is to decide. You calculate on the weaknesses of human nature, and you suffer
the judge to be dependent on no one, lest he should be partial to those on whom he depends. Justice does not exist
where partiality prevails. A dependent judge cannot be
impartial. Independence, is, therefore, essential. to the
purity of your judicial tribunals.
Let it be remembered, that no power is so sensibly felt
by society as that of the judiciary. The life and property
of every man is liable to be in the hands of the judges. Is
it not our great interest to place our judges upon such high
ground that no fear can intimidate, no hope seduce them?
The present measure humbles them in the dust; it prostrates them at the feet of faction; it renders them the tools
of every dominant party. It is this effect which I deprecate; it is this consequence which I deeply deplore.
What does reason, what does argument avail, when party
spirit presides? Subject your bench to the influence of
this spirit, and justice bids a final adieu to your tribunals.
We are asked, sir, if the judges are to be independent of
the people. The question presents a false and delusive
view. We are all the people. We are, and as long as we
enjoy our freedom, we shall be divided into parties. The
true question is, shall the judiciary be permanent, or flueiuate with the tide of public opinion? I beg, I implore
196gentlemen to consider the magnitude and value of the principle which they are about to annihilate. If your judges
are independent of-political changes, they may have their
preferences, but they will not enter into the spirit of party.
But let their existence depend upon the support of the
power of a certain set of men, and they cannot be impartial. Justice will be trodden under foot. Your courts will
lose all public confidence and respect.
The judges will be supported by their partisans, who, in
their turn, will expect impunity for the wrongs and violence
they comrntit. The spirit of party will be inflamed to madness; and the moment is not far off, when this fair country
is to be desolated by a civil war.
Do not say that you render the judges dependent only on
the people. You make them dependent on your president.
This is his measure. The same tide of public opinion
which changes a president, will change the majorities in
the branches of the legislature. The legislature will be
the instrument of his ambition, and he will have the courts
as the intrument of his vengeance. He uses the legislature to remove the judges, that he may appoint creatures
of his own. In effect, the powers of the government will
be concentrated in the hands of one man, who will dare to
act with more boldness, because he will be sheltered from
responsibility. The independence of the judiciary was the
felicity of our constitution. It was this principle which
was to curb the fury of party on sudden changes. The
first moments of power, gained by a struggle, are the most
vindictive and intemperate. Raised above the storm, it
was the judiciary which was to control the fiery zeal, and
to quell the fierce passions of a victorious faction.
We are standing on the brink of that revolutionary torrent which deluged in blood one of the fairest countries of
Europe.
France had her national assembly, more numerous and
equally popular with our own. She had her tribunals of
justice, and her juries. But the legislature and her courts
were but the instruments of her destruction. Acts of proscription and sentences of banishment and death were
passed in the cabinet of a tyrant. Prostrate your judges at
the feet of party, and you break down the mounds wnichi
defend you from this torrent. I am done. I should have

197PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
ON THE INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE.
Besides the pauses, which indicate a greater or less separation of
the parts of a sentence and a conclusion of the whole, there are certain
inflections of voice, accompanying these pauses, which are as necessary
to the sense of the sentence as the pauses themselves; for, however
exactly we may pause between those parts which are separable, if we
do not pause with such an inflection of the voice as is suited to the
sense, the composition we read will not only want its true meaning, but
will have a meaning very different from that intended by the writer.
Whether words are pronounced in a high or low, in a loud or soft
tone; whether they are pronounced swiftly or slowly, forcibly or feebly,
with the tone of passion or without it; they must necessarily be pronounced either sliding upward or downward, or else go into a monotone or song.
By the rising or falling inflection, is not meant the pitch of the voice
in which the whole word is pronounced, or that loudness or softness
which may accompany any pitch; but that upward or downward slide
which the voice makes when the pronunciation of a word is finishing,
and which may, therefore, not improperly, be called the rising and falling inflection.
We must carefully guard against mistaking the low tone at the beginning of the rising inflection for the falling inflection, and the high
tone at the beginning of the falling inflection for the rising inflection,
as they are not denominated rising or falling from the high or low tone
in which they are pronounced, but from the upward or downward slide
in which they terminate, whether pronounced in a high or low key.
THE FINAL PAUSE OR PERIOD.
RULE I.--The falling inflection takes place at a period.
EXAMPLES.
1. That man is little to be envied whose patriotism
would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon, or whose
piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona'.
2. The pleasures of the imagination, the pleasure arising
from  science, from the fine arts, and from the principle of
curiosity, are peculiar to the human' species.
When a sentence concludes an antithesis, the first branch of which,
being emphatic, requires the falling inflection; the second branch requires the weak emphasis, and rising inflection.
Note.-When there is a succession of periods or loose members in a
sentence, though they may all have the falling inflection, yet every one
of them ought to be pronounced in a somewhat different pitch of the
voice from the other.
EXAMPLES.
1. If we have no regard for our own' character, we ought to have;some regard for the character of others'.

thanked my God for greater power to resist a measure so
destructive to the peace and happiness of the country.
My feeble efforts can avail nothing. But it was my duty
to make them. The meditated blow is mortal, and from
the moment it is struck, we may bid a final adieu to the
constitution.
76.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF JOHN RANDOLPH, IN COM
MITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ON
MR. GREGG S RESOLUTION TO PROHIBIT THE IMPORTATION OF BRITISH GOODS INTO THE UNITED STATES, MARCH
5, 1806.
FOR my part, I never will go to war but in self-defence.
I have no desire for conquests, no ambition to possess Nova
Scotia. I hold the liberties of this people at a higher rate.
Much more am I indisposed to war, when, among the first
means for carrying it on, I see gentlemen propose the confiscation of debts due by government to individuals. Does
a bona fide creditor know who holds his paper? Dare any
honest man ask himself the question?'Tis hard to say
whether such principles are more detestably dishonest than
they are weak and foolish. What, sir, will you go about
with proposals for opening a loan in one hand, and a
sponge for the national debt in the other?  If, on a late
occasion, you could not borrow at a less rate of interest than
8 per cent., when the government avowed that they would
pay to the last shilling of the public ability, at what price
do you expect to raise money with an avowal of these
nefarious opinions? God help you! if these are your
ways and means for carrying on war-if your finances are
in the hands of such a chancellor of the exchequer. Because a man can take an observation and keep a log-book
and reckoning, can navigate a cockboat to the West Indies
or the East, shall he aspire to navigate the great vessel of
state?-to stand at the helm of public councils?  Ne
sutor ultra crepidarn. What are you going to war for?
For the carrying trade. Already you possess seven-eighths
of it. What is the object in dispute? The fair, honest
trade that exchanges the product of our soil for foreign
articles for home consumption? Not at all. You are
198RANDOLPH.                     199
called upon to sacrifice this necessary branch of your navigation and the great agricultural interest, whose handmaid
it is,-to jeopard your best interest for a circuitous commerce, for the fraudulent protection of belligerant property
under your neutral flag. Will you be goaded by the
dreaming calculation of insatiate avarice to stalie your all
for the protection of this trade? I do not speak of the
probable effects of war on the price of our produce. Severely as we must feel, we may scuffle through it. I speak of
its reaction on the constitution. You may go to war for
this excrescence of the carrying trade-and make peace at
the expense of the constitution. Your executive will lord
it over you, and you must make the best terms with the conqueror that you can. But the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gregg) tells you that he is for acting in this, as in
all things, uninfluenced by the opinion of any minister
whatever-foreign, or, I presume, domestic. On this point
I am ready to meet the gentleman, am unwilling as he can
be, to be dictated to by any minister at home or abroad.
Is he willing to act on the same independent footing? I have
before protested, and I again protest against secret, irresponsible, overruling influence. The first question I asked
when I saw the gentleman's resolution was, " Is this a
measure of the cabinet?"  Not of an open, declared cabinet, but of an invisible, inscrutable, unconstitutional cabinet,
without responsibility, unknown to the constitution. I
speak of back-stairs influence-of men who bring messages to this house, which, although they do not appear on
the journals, govern its decisions. Sir, the first question that
I asked on the subject of British relations was, What is the
opinion of the cabinet? What measures will they recommend to congress? (well knowing that whatever measures
we might take, they must execute them, and therefore that
we should have their opinion on the subject.) My answer
was, (and from a cabinet minister too,) " There is no cabznet." Subsequent circumstances, sir, have given me a
personal knowledge of the fact. It needs no commentary.
But the gentleman has told you that we ought to go to
war, if fobr nothing else, for the fur trade. Now, sir, the
people on whose support he seems to calculate,. follow (let
me tell him) a better business, and let me add, that while
men are happy at home reaping their own fields, the'0THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
fruits of their labour and industry, there is little danger of
their being induced to go sixteen or seventeen hundred
miles in pursuit of beavers, raccoons, or opossums--much
less of going to war for the privilege. They are better
employed where they are. This trade, sir, may be important to Britains, to nations who have exhauste(l every
resource of industry at hlome, bowed down by taxation and
wretchedness. Let them, in God's name, if they please,
follow the fur trade. They may, for me, catch every beaver in North America. Yes, sir, our people have a better
occupation-a safe, profitable, honourable employment.
While they should be engaged in distant regions in
hunting the beaver, they dread but those, whose natural
prey they are, should begin to hunt them, should pillage
their property, and assassinate their constitution.  Give up
these wild schemes,--pay off your debt, and do not prate
about its confiscation. Do not, I beseech you, expose at
once your knavery and your folly. You have more lands
than you know what do with; you have lately paid fifteen
millions for yet more. Go and work them--and cease to
alarm the people with the cry of wolf! until they become
deaf to your voice, or at least laugh at you.
Mr. Chairman, if I felt less regard for what I deem the
best interest of this nation, than for my own reputation, I
should not on this day have offered to address you, but
would have waited to come out bedecked with flowers and
bouquets of rhetoric, in a set speech. But, sir, I dreaded
lest a tone might be given to the mind of the committeethey will pardon me, but I did fear, from all that I could
see, or hear, that they might be prejudiced by its advocates
(under pretence of protecting our commerce) in favour of
this ridiculous and preposterous project,-I rose, sir, for
one, to plead guilty--to declare in the face of day, that I
will not go to war for this carrying trade. I will agree to
pass for an idiot if this is not the public sentiment, and you
will find it to your cost, begin the war when you will.
77.-SECOND EXTRACT FROM THE SAME.
AT the commencement of this session we received a
printed message from the president of the United States,
breathing a-great deal of national honour and indignation at
200the outrages we had endured, particularly from Spain.
She was specially named and pointed at; she had pirated
upon your commerce, imprisoned your citizens, violated
your actual territory, invaded the very limits solemnly
established between the two nations by the treaty of San
Lorenzo. Some of the state legislatures (among others
the very state on which the gentleman from Pennsylvania
relies for support) sent forward resolutions pledging their
lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honours, in support
of any measures you might take in vindication of your
injured rights. Well, sir, what have you done?  You
have resolutions laid upon your table-gone to some expense of printing and stationery--mere pen, ink and paper,
and that's all. Like true political quacks, you deal only in
handbills and nostrums. Sir, I blush to see the record of
our proceedings; they resemble nothing but the advertisement of patent medicines. Here you have the " Wormdestroying Lozenges;" there, " Church's Cough Drops,"
and, to crown the whole, "Sloan's Vegetable Specific,"
an infallible remedy for all nervous disorders and vertigoes
of brain-sick politicians; each man earnestly adjuring you
to give his medicine only a fair trial. If,, indeed, these
wonder-working nostrums could performn but one half of
what they promise, there is little danger of our dying a
political death at this time, at least. But, sir, in politics as
in physic, the doctor is ofttimes the most dangerous
disease: and this I take to be our case at present.
But, sir, why do I talk of Spain? there are no longer
Pyrenees. There exists no such nation, no such being as
a Spanish king or minister. It is a mere juggle played off
for the benefit of those who put the mechanism into motion.
You know, sir, that you have no differences with Spain;
that she is the passive tool of a superior power, to whom
at this moment you are crouching. Are your differences
indeed with Spain? And where are you going to send
your political panacea, (resolutions and handbills excepted,)
your sole arcanum of government, your king 6ure-all?To Madrid? No--you are not such quacks as not to know
where the slioe pinches-to Paris. You know at least
where the disease lies, and there you apply your remedy.
When the nation anxiously demands the reslilt of your
deliberation, you hang your head and blush to tell. lYou
M01
RANDOLPH.THE AMERICAN1 SPEAKER.
are afraid to tell. Your mouth is hermetically sealed
Your honour has received a wound which must not take
air. Gentlemen dare not come forward and avow their
work, much less defend it in the presence of the nation.
Give them all they ask, that Spain exacts, and what then?
After shrinking from the Spanish jackall, do you presume
to bully the British lion? But here the secret comes out.
Britain is your rival in trade, and governed, as you are, by
counting-house politicians, you would sacrifice the paramount interests of the country, to wound that rival.
For Spain and France you are carriers-and from good
customers every indignity is to be endured. And what is
the nature of this trade?  Is it that carrying trade which
sends abroad the flour, tobacco, cotton, beef, pork, fish, and
lumber of this country, and brings back in return foreign
articles necessary for our existence or comfort? No, sir;'tis a trade carried on, the Lord knows where, or by
whom; now doubling Cape Horn, now the Cape of Good
Hope. I do not say that there is no profit in it-for it
would not then be pursued-but'tis a trade that tends to
assimilate our manners and government to those of the
most corrupt countries of Europe--yes, sir, and when a
question of great national magnitude presents itself to you,
causes those who now prate about national hollour and
spirit, to pocket any insult, to consider it as a mere matter of
debit and credit, a business of profit and loss,and nothing else.
The first thing that struck my mind when this resolution
was laid on the table was, U(Jde derivatur? a question
often put to us at school, Whence comes it? Is this only
the putative father of the bantling he is taxed to maintain, or
indeed the actual parent, the real progenitor of the child?
or is it the production of the cabinet?  But I knew you
had no cabinet, no system. I had seen despatches relating
to vital measures, laid before you the day after your final
decision on those measures,-four weeks after they were
received-not only their contents, but their very existence,
all that time unsuspected and unknown to men whom the
people fondly believe assist with their wisdom and experience at every important deliberation of government. Do
you believe that this system, or rather this no system, will
do? I am free to answer it will not. It cannot last. I
tmi not so afraid of the fair, open, constitutional, responsi202ble influence of government; but I shrink intuitively from
this left-handed, invisible, irresponsible influence, which
defies the touch, but pervades and decides every thing.
Let the executive come forward to the legislature; let us
see while we feel it. If we cannot rely on its wisdom, is
it any disparagement to the gentleman from Pennsylvania
to say that I cannot rely upon him? No, sir; he has mistaken his talent. He is not the Palinurus, on whose skill
the nation, at this trying moment, can repose their confidence. I will have nothing to do with this paper-much
less will I endorse it and make myself responsible for its
goodness; I will not put my name to it. I assert that
there is no cabinet nor system, no plan. That which I
believe in one place, I shall never hesitate to say in another.
This is no time, no place for milcing our words. The
people have a right to know, they shall know the state of
their affairs, at least as far as I am at liberty to communicate them. I speak from personal knowledge. Ten days
ago there had been no consultation, there existed no opinion
in your executive department, at least none that was
avowed; on the contrary, there was an express disavowal
of any opinion whatsoever on the great subject before you,
and I have good reason for saying that none has been
formed since. Some time ago a book was laid on our
table, which, like some other bantlings, did not bear the
name of its father. Here I was taught to expect a solution
of all doubts, an end to all our difficulties. If, sir, I were
the foe, as I trust I am the friend to this nation, I would
exclaim, " O that mine enemy would write a book." At
the very outset, in the very first page, I believe, there
is a complete abandonment of the principle in dispute.
Has any gentleman got the work?  [It was handed by one
of the members.]  The first position taken is the broad
principle of the unlimited freedom of trade between nations
at peace, which the writer endeavours to extend to the
trade between a neutral and belligerant power, accompanied, however, by this acknowledgment--" But inasmuch
as the trade of a neutral with a belligerant nation might, in
certain special cases, affect the safety of its antagonist,
usage,fiounded on tLe principle of NECESSITY, has admitted
a few exceptions to the general rule."  Whence comes the
doctrine of contraband, blockade, and enemy's property?
RANDOLPH.
203THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Now, sir, for what does that celebrated pamplhlet, " War in
Disguise," which is said to have been written under the
eye of the British prime minister, contend, but this " principle of necessity?" And this ground is abandoned by
this pamphleteer at the very threshold of the discussion.
But, as if this were not enough, he goes on to assign as a
reason for not referring to the authority of the ancients, that
" the great change which has taken place in the state of
manners, in the maxims of war, and in the course of commerce, make itpretty certain" (what degree of certainty is
this?) " that either nothing will be found relating to the
question, or nothing sufficiently applicable to deservt
attention in deciding it." Here, sir, as an apology of the
writer for not disclosing the whole extent of his learning,
(which might have overwhelmed the reader,) is the admission, that a change of circumstances (" in the course of
commerce") has made (and therefore will now justify) a
total change of the law of nations. What more could the
most inveterate advocate of English usurpation demand?
What else call they require to establish all, and even more
than they contend for?  Sir, there is a class of men--we
know thern very well-who, if'you only permit them to
lay the foundation, will build you up step by step, and
brick by brick, very neat and showy if not tenable arguments. To detect them,'tis only necessary to watch their
premises, where you will often find the point at issue
totally surrendered, as in this case it is. Again, is the
mare liberum any where asserted in this book 7? that free
ships make free goods?- No, sir; the right of search is
acknowledged; that enemy's property is lawful prize is
sealed and delivered. And after abandoning these principles, what becomes of the doctrine that a mere shifting of
the goods from one ship to another, the touching at another
port changes the property? Sir, give up this principle,
and there is an end of the question.
78.--DRESS AND ARMOUR OF SIR HUDIBRAS.
His doublet was of sturdy buff,
And though not sword, yet cudgel-proof,
Whereby'twas fitter for his use,
Who fear'd no blows but such as bruise.
204BUTLER.
His breeches were of rugged woollen,
And had been at the siege of Bullen;
To old King Harry so well known,
Some writers held they were his own.
Through they were lined with many a piece
Of ammunition bread and cheese,
And fat black-puddings, proper food
For warriors that delight in blood:
For, as we said, he always chose
To carry victual in his hose,
That often tempted rats and mice
The ammunition to surprise.
His puissant sword unto his side,
Near his undaunted heart, was tied,
With basket hilt that would hold broth,
And serve for fight and dinner both;
In it he melted lead for bullets
Toshoot at foes, and sometimes pullets,
To whom he bore so fell a grutch,
He ne'er gave quarter to any such.
The trenchant blade, Toledo trusty,
For want of fighting was grown rusty,
And ate into itself, for lack
Of somebody to hew and hack:
The peaceful scabbard, where it dwelt,
The rancour of its edge had felt;
For of the lower end two handful
It had devour'd,'twas so manful,
And so much scorn'd to lurk in case,
As if it durst not show its face.
In many desperate attempts
Of warrants, exigents, contempts,
It had appear'd with courage bolder
Than Sergeant Bum invading shoulder:
Oft had it ta'en possession,
And prisoners too, or made them run.
This sword a dagger had, his page,
That was but little for his age;
And therefore waited on him so,
As dwarfs upon knights-errant do:
18
205206            THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
It was a serviceable, dudgeon,
Either for fighting or for drudging:
When it had stabb'd or broke a head,
It would scrape trenchers, or chip bread;
Toast cheese or bacon, though it were
To bait a mousetrap,'twould not care:'Twould make clean shoes, and in the earth
Set leeks and onions, and so forth;
It had been'prentice to a brewer,
Where this and more it did endure,
But left the trade, as many more
Have lately done on the same score.
In th' holsters, at his saddle-bow,
Two aged pistols he did stow,
Among the surplus of such meat
As in his hose he could not get:'I'hese would inveigle rats with th' scent,
To forage when the cocks were bent,
And sometimes catch'em with a slap,
As cleverly as the ablest trap:
They were upon hard duty still,
And every night stood sentinel,
To guard th' magazine i' th' hose
From two-legg'd and from four-legg'd foes.
Thus clad and fortified, Sir Knight,
From peaceful home, set forth to fight.  BUTLER
79.-DESCRIPTION OF WYOMING.
ON Susquehanna's side, fair Wyoming!
Although the wild flower on thy ruin'd wall
And roofless homes, a sad remembrance bring
Of what thy gentle people did befall;
Yet thou wert once the loveliest land of all
That see the Atlantic wave their morn restore.
Sweet land! may I thy lost delights recall,
And paint thy Gertrude in her bowers of yore,
Whose beauty was the love of Pennsylvania's shore!
Delightful Wyoming! beneath thy skies,
The happy shepherd swains had naught to do,
But feed their flocks on green declivities,
Or skim perchance thy lake with light canoe,From morn, till evening's sweeter pastime grew,
With timbrel, when beneath the forests brown,
Thy lovely maidens would the dance renew;
And aye those sunny mountains half-way down
Would echo flageolet from some romantic town.
Then, where of Indian hills the daylight takes
His leave, how might you the flamingo see
Disporting like a meteor on the lakesAnd playful squirrel on his nut-grown tree:
And every sound of life was full of glee,
From merry mock-bird's song, or hum of men;
While hearkening, fearing naught their revelry,
The wild deer arch'd his neck from glades, and then
Unhunted, sought his woods and wilderness again.
And scarce had Wyoming of war or crime
Heard, but in transatlantic story rung,
For here the exile met from every clime,
And spoke in friendship every distant tongue:
Men from the blood of warring Europe sprung,
Were but divided by the running brook;
And happy where no Rhenish trumpet sung,
On plains no sieging mine's volcano shook,
The blue-eved German changed his sword to pruning-hook.
CAMPBELL.
80.-SONG OF THE GREEK BARD.
THE Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
Where grew the arts of war and peace,Where Delos rose, and Phcbus sprung!
Eternal summer gilds them yet,
But all, except their sun, is set.
The Scian and the Teian muse,
The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
Have found the fame your shores refuse;
Their place of birth alone is mute
To sounds which echo further west
Than your sires' "Islands of the Blest."

NEGATIVE SENTENCE.
RULE 11.-Negative sentences, or members of sentences,
must end with the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. The region beyond the grave is not a solitary' land.
There your fathers are, and thither every other friend shall
follow you in due season.
2. True charity is not a meteor, whicli occasionally'
glares; but a luminary, which, in its orderly and regular

PENULTIMATE MEMBER.?
RULE III.--The penultimate member of a sentence requires the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. We were now treading that illustrious island which
was once the luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence
savage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits of
knowledge', and the blessings of religion.
2. Mahomet was a native of Mecca, a city of that division of Arabia, which, for the luxury of its soil and happy
temperature of its climate, has ever been esteemed the
loveliest and sweetest' region in the world, and distinguished by the epithet of happy.
DIRECT PERIOD.

constructive parts connected by corresponding conjunctions or adverbs, requires the long pause, with the
rising inflection at the end of the first part.
EXAMPLES.
1. If, when we behold a well-made and well-regulated
watch, we infer the operations of a skilful artificer'; then,

The mountains look on MarathonAnd Marathon looks on the sea;
And musing there an hour alone,
I dream'd that Greece might still be free
For standing on the Persian's grave,
I could not deem myself a slave.
A king sat on the rocky brow
Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
And ships, by thousands, lay below,
And men and nations-all were his!
He counted them at break of dayAnd when the sun set--where were they?
And where are they? and where art thou,
My country? On thy voiceless shore
Th' heroic lay is tuneless nowTh' heroic bosom beats no more!
And must thy lyre, so long-divine,
Degenerate into hands like mine?
Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
Must we but blush? Our fathers bled.
Earth! render back from out thy breast
A remnant of our Spartan dead!
Of the three hundred-grant but three,
To make a new Thermopylae!

Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
And answer, " Let one living head,
But one arise,--we come, we come!"'Tis but the living who are dumb.

But gazing on each glowing maid,

81.-DESCRIPTION OF THE MINSTREL.
T'HE wight, whose tale these artless lines unfold,
Was all tile offspring of this humble pair:
His birth no oracle or seer foretold;
No prodigy appear'd in earth or air,
Nor aught that might a strange event declare.
You guess each circumstance of Edwin's birth;
The parent's transport, and the parent's care;
The gossip's prayer for wealth, and wit, and worth,
And one long summer-day of indolence and mirth.
And yet poor Edwin was no vulgar boy,
Deep thought oft seem'd to fix his infant eye.
Dainties he heeded not, nor gaude, nor toy,
Save one short pipe of rudest minstrelsy:
Silent when glad; affectionate, though shy;
And now his look was most demurely sad;
And now he laugh'd aloud, yet none knew why,
The neighbours stared and sigh'd, yet bless'd the lad,:
Some deem'd him wondrous wise, and some believed him
mad.
But why should I his childish feats display?
Concourse and noise, and toil, he ever fled;
Nor cared to mingle in the clamorous fray
Of squabbling imps; but to the forest sped,
Or roam'd at large the lonely mountain's head,
Or, where the maze of some bewilder'd stream
To deep untrodden groves his footsteps led.
There would he wander wild, till Phoebus' beam,
Shot from the western cliff, released the weary team.
Th' exploit of strength, dexterity, or speed,
To him nor vanity nor joy could bring.
His heart, from cruel sport estranged, would bleed
To work the wo of any living thing,
By trap, or net; by arrow, or by sling;
These he detested; those he scorn'd to wield:
He wish'd to be the guardian, not the king,
Tyrant far less, or traitor of the field.
And sure the sylvan reign unbloody joy might yield.
210Lo! where the stripling, wrapt in wonder, roves
Beneath the precipice o'erhung with pine,
And sees, on high, amidst the encircling groves,
From cliff to cliff the foaming torrents shine;
While waters, woods, and winds, in concert Join,
And echo swells the chorus to the skies.
Would Edwin this majestic scene resign
For aught the huntsman's puny craft supplies?
Ah! no: he better knows great Nature's charm to prize.
And oft he traced the uplands, to survey,
When o'er the sky advanced the kindling dawn,
The crimson cloutd, blue main, and mountain gray
And lake, dim-gleaming on the smoky lawn:
Far to the west the long, long vale withdrawn,
Where twilight loves to linger for a while;
And now he faintly kens the bounding fawn,
And villager abroad at early toil.
But, lo! the sun appears! and heaven, earth, ocean,
smile.
And oft the craggy cliff he loved to climb,
When all in mist the world below was lost.
What dreadful pleasure? there to stand sublime
Like shipwreck'd mariner on desert coast,
And view the enormous waste of vapour, tost
In billows, lengthening to the horizon round,
Now scoop'd in gulfs, with mountains now emboss'd!
And hear the voice of mirth and song rebound,
Flocks, herds, and waterfalls, along the hoar profound!
In truth he was a strange and wayward wight,
Fond of each gentle and each dreadful scene.
In darkness, and in stormn, he found delight:
Nor less, than when on ocean wave serene
The southern sun diffused his dazzling shene.
Even sad vicissitude amused his soul:
And if a sigh would sometimes intervene,
And down his cheek a tear of pity roll,
A sigh, a tear, so sweet, he wish'd not to control.

THE Niobe of nations! there she stands,
Childless and crownless, in her voiceless wo;
An empty urn within her wither'd hands,
Whose holy dust was scatter'd long ago:
The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;
The very sepulchres lie tenantless
Of their heroic dwellers: dost thou flow,
Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?
Rise with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress.
The Goth, the Christian, Time, War, Flood, and Fire,
Have dealt upon the seven hill'd city's pride;
She saw her glories star by star expire,
And up the steep, barbarian monarchs ride,
Where the car climb'd the capitol; far and wide
Temple and tower went down, nor left a site:Chaos of ruins! who shall trace the void,
O'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,
And say, " Here was, or is," where all is doubly night?
The double night of ages, and of her,
Night's daughter, Ignorance, hath wrapt and wrap
All round us; we but feel our way to err:
The ocean hath his chart, the stars their map,
And Knowledge spreads them on her ample lap:
But Rome is as the desert, where we steer
Stumbling o'er recollections; now we clap
Our hands, and cry, " Eureka!" it is clearWhen but some false mirage of ruin rises near.
Alas! the lofty city! and, alas!
The trebly hundred triumphs! and the day
When Brutus made the dagger's edge surpass
The conqueror's sword in bearing fame away!
Alas, for Tully's voice, and Virgil's lay,
And Livy's pictured page!-but these shall be
Her resurrection; all beside-decay.
Alas, for Earth, for never shall we see
That brightness in her eye she bore when Rome was free i
O thou, whose chariot roll'd on Fortune's wheel,'rriumphant Sylla! T'hou, who didst subdue
212Thy country's foes ere thou wouldst pause to feel
The wrath of thy own wrongs, or reap the due
Of hoarded vengeance till thine eagles flew
O'er prostrate Asia;--thou, who with thy frown
Annihilated senates-Roman, too,
With all thy vices, for thou didst lay down
With an atoning smile a more than earthly crown--
The dictatorial wreath,--couldst thou divine
To what would one day dwindle that which made
Thee more than mortal? and that so supine
By aught than Romans Rome should thus be laid?
She who was named Eternal, and array'd
Her warriors but to conquer; she who veil'd
Earth with her haughty shadow, and display'd
Until the o'ercanopied horizon fail'd,
Her rushing wings; O! she who was Almighty hail'd!

Was thy voice mute amid the festal crowd,
When lay of hopeless love, or glory won,
Aroused the fearful or subdued the proud.
At each according pause was heard aloud

84.-EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF JOHN RANDOLPH, DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED
STATES, DECEMBER 10, 1811,
On the second resolution reported by the committee of foreign relations,
"That an additional force of ten thousand regular troops ought to be
immediately raised, to serve for three years; and that a bounty in
lands ought to be given to encourage enlistment."
MR. SPEAKER,-This is a question, as it has been presented to this house, of peace or war. In that light it has
been argued; in no other light can I consider it, after the
declarations made by members of the committee of foreign
relations.  Without intending any disrespect to the chair,
I must be permitted to say, that if the decision yesterday
was correct, " that it was not in order to advance any arguinents against the resolution, drawn from topics before
other committees of the house," the whole debate, nay, the
report itself, on which we are acting, is disorderly, since
the increase of the military force is a subject, at this time,
in agitation by a select committee, raised on that branch of
the president's message. But it is impossible that the discussion of a question, broad as the wide ocean of our
foreign concerns, involving every consideration of interest,
of right, of happiness, and of safety at home; touching,
in every point, all that is dear to freemen, "their lives,
their fortunes, and their sacred honour," can be tied down
by the narrow rules of technical routine.
The committee of foreign relations have, indeed, decided that the subject of arming the militia (which has
been pressed upon them as indispensable to the public
214security) does not come within the scope of their authority.
On what ground, I have been and still am unable to see,
they have felt themselves authorized to recommend the
raising of standing armies, with a view  (as has been
declared) of immediate war-a war, not of defence, but of
conquest, of aggrandizement, of ambition-a war foreign
to the interests of this country-to the interests of humanity
itself.
I know not how gentlemen, calling themselves republicans, can advocate such a war. What was their doctrine
in 1798 and'9, when the command of the army--that
bighest of all possible trusts in any government, be the
form what it may--was reposed in the bosom of the father
of his country-the sanctuary of a nation's love; the
only hope that never came in vain!-when other worthies
of the revolution, Hamilton, Pinkney, and the younger
Washington, men of tried patriotism, of approved conduct
and valour, of untarnished honour, held subordinate command under him. Republicans were then unwilling to
trust a standing army even to his hands, who had given
proof that he was above all human temptation. Where
now is the revolutionary hero, to whom you are about to
confide this sacred trust? To whom will you confide the
charge of leading the flower of our youth to the heights
of Abraham? Will you find him in the person of an
acquitted felon? What! then you are unwilling to vote
an army where such men as have been named held high
command! When Washlington himself was at the head,
did you show such reluctance, feel such scruples; and are
you now nothing loath, fearless of every consequence?
Will you say that your provocations were less then than
now, when your direct commerce was interdicted, your
ambassadors hooted with derision from the French court,
tribute demanded, actual war waged upon you?
Those who opposed the army then, were, indeed,
denounced as the partisans of France; as the same men
(some of them at least) are now held up as the advocates
of England; those firm and undeviating republicans, who
then dared, and now dare, to cling to the ark of the constitution, to defend it even at the expense of their fame,
rather than surrender themselves to the wild projects of
mad ambition. There is a fatality attending plenitude of

power. Soon or late, some mania seizes upon its possessors; they fall from the dizzy height through giddiness
Like a vast estate, heaped up by the labour and industry of
one man, which seldom survives the third generation;
power gained by patient assiduity, by a faithful and regular
discharge of its attendant duties, soon gets above its own
origin. Intoxicated with their own greatness, the federal
party fell. Will not the same causes produce the saime
effects now as then? Sir, you mray raise this army, you
may build up this vast structure of patronage; but " lay not
the flattering unction to your souls;" you will never live
to enjoy the succession. You sign your political deathwarrant.
85.-SECOND EXTRACT FROM THE SAME.
MR. SPEAKER,-HOw have we shown our sympathy
with the patriots of Spain, or with the American provinces?
By seizing on one of them, her claim to which we had
formerly respected, as soon as the parent country was
embroiled at home. Is it thus we yield them assistance
against the arch-fiend, who is grasping at the sceptre of
the civilized world?  The object of France is as much
Spanish-America as old Spain herself. Much as I hate a
standing army, I could almost find it my heart to vote one,
could it be sent to the assistance of the Spanish patriots.
Against whom are these charges of British predilection
brought? Against men, who, in the war of the revolution,
were in the councils of the nation, or fighting the battles of
your country. And by whom are they made? By runaways chiefly from the British dominions, since the breaking out of the French troubles. It is insufferable. It cannot be borne. It must and ought, with severity, to be put
down in this house, and out of it to meet the lie direct.
We have no fellow feeling for the suffering and oppressed
Spaniards! Yet even them we do not reprobate.
Strange! that we should have no objection to any other
people or government, civilized or savage, in the whole
world! The great autocrat of all the Russias receives the
homage of our high consideration. The dey of Algiers
and his divan of pirates are very civil, good sort of people,with whom we find no difficulty in maintaining the relations of peace and amity. " Turks, Jews, and Infidels,"
Vlelimelli or the Little Turtle; barbarians and savages of
every clime and colour, are welcome to our arms. With
chiefs of banditti, negro or mulatto, we can treat and can
trade. Name, however, but England, and all our antipathies are up in arms against her. Against whom? Against
those whose blood runs in our veins; in common with
whom, we claim Shakspeare, and Newton, and Chatham,
for our countrymen; whose form of government is the
freest on earth, our own only excepted: from whom every
valuable principle of our own institutions has been borrowed-representation-jury trial--voting the supplies--
writ of habeas corpus--our whole civil and criminal jurisprudence;-against our fellow Protestants, identified in blood,
in language, in religion with ourselves. In what school did
the worthies of our land, the Washingtons, Henrys, Hancocks, Franklins, Rutledges of America learn those principles of civil liberty which were so nobly asserted by their
wisdom and valour?   American resistance to British
usurpation has not been more warmly cherished by these
great men and their compatriots; not more by Washington, Hancock and Henry, than by Chatham and his illustrious associates in the British parliament. It ought to be
remembered, too, that the heart of the English people was
with us. It was a selfish and corrupt ministry, and their
servile tools, to whom we were not more opposed than
they were. I trust that none such may ever exist among
us; for tools will never be wanting to subserve the purposes, however ruinous or wicked, of kings and ministers of-state. I acknowledge the influence of a Shakspeare and a Milton upon my imagination, of a Locke upon
my understanding, of a Sidney upon my political principles, of a Chatham upon qualities which, would to God, I
possessed in common with that illustrious man! of a Tillotson, a Sherlock, and a Porteus, upon my religion. This
is a British influence which I can never shake off.
I allow much to the just and honest prejudices growing
out of the revolution. But by whom have they been suppressed, when they ran counter to the interests of my
country? By Washington. By whom, would you listen
to them, are they most keenly felt? By felons escaped

whenever you see them discovering a growing disregard to
the divine law'; there you see proportional advances made
to ruin and misery.*
3. When the mountains shall be dissolved; when the

4. Perfection is not the lot of humanity, and the age of
heroism had its foibles, as well as the modern. If we are
effeminate', they were too often ferocious. If we less frequently produce those astonishing examples of heroism and
generosity', we are not so cruel and revengeful.    If we are
not so famous for fidelity in friendship, and if we are less
disinterested and warm', our resentments are also less
inexorable.
Iote.-When the emphatical word in the conditional part of the
sentence is in direct opposition to another word in the conclusion, and
a concession is implied in the former, in order to strengthen the argument in the latter, the first member has the falling, and the last the
rising inflection.

1. If we have no regard for religion in youth', we ought to have
some regard for it in age'.
2. If we have no regard for our own' character, we ought to have
some regard for the character of others'.
If these sentences had been formed so as to make the latter member
a mere inference from, or consequence of, the former, the general rule
would have taken place: thus1. If we have no regard for religion in youth', we have seldom afiy
regard for it in age'.
2. If we have no regard for our own' character, it can scarcely be
expected that we could have any regard for the character of others'.
RULE V.-Direct periods, commencing with participles
of the present and past tense, consist of two parts;
between which must be inserted the long pause and
rising inflection.

from the jails of Paris, Newgate and Kilmainham, since the
breaking out of the French revolution; who, in this abused
and insulted country, have-set up for political teachers, and
whose disciples give no other proof of their progress in
republicanism, except a blind devotion to the most ruthless
military despotism that the world ever saw. These are
the patriots who scruple not to brand with the epithet of
tory, the men [looking toward the seat of Colonel Stewart] by whose blood your liberties have been cemented
These are they, who hold in such keen remembrance the
outrages of the British armies, from which many of them
are deserters. Ask these self-styled patriots where they were
during the American war, (for they are, for the most part,
old enough to have borne arms,) and you strilke them
dumb; their lips are closed in eternal silence. If it were
allowable to entertain partialities, every consideration of
blood, language, religion and interest, would incline us
toward England; and yet, shall they be alone extended to
France and her ruler, whom we are bound to believe a
chastening God suffers as the scourge of a guilty world?
On all other nations he tramplies; he holds them in contempt; England alone he hates; he would but he cannot
despise her; fear cannot despise. And shall we disparage
our ancestors? Shall we disgrace ourselves by placing
them  even below the brigands of St. Domingo?-with
whom Mr. Adams negociated a sort of treaty, for which he
ought to have been and would have been impeached, if the
people had not previously passed sentence of disqualifica-tion for their service upon him. This antipathy to all that
is English must be French.
But the outrages and injuries of England, bred up in the
principles of the revolution, I can never palliate, much less
defend them. I well remember flying, with my mother
and her new-born child, from Arnold and Phillips--and we
were driven by Tarleton and other British pandours, from
pillar to post, while her husband was fighting the battles of
his country. The impression is indelible on my memory;
and yet (like my worthy old neighbour, who added seven
buckshot to every cartridge at the battle of Guilford, and
-drew a fine sight at his man) I must be content to be called:a tory by a patriot of the last importation. Let us not get
id of one evil (supposing it possible) at the expense of a
218greater: mutatis mutandis, suppose France in possession
of the British naval power-and to her the trident nmust pass,
should England be unable to wield it--what would be vour
condition? What would be the situation of your seaports, and
their seafaring inhabitants? Ask Hamburg, Lubeck! Ask
Savannah! What, sir, when their privateers are pent up in
our harbours by the British bull-dogs: when they receive at
our hands every right of hospitality, from which their enemy
is excluded; when they capture in our own waters, interdict
ed to British armed ships, American vessels; when such is
their deportment toward you, under such circumstances,
what could you expect if they were the uncontrolled lords of
the ocean? Had those privateers at Savannah borne Britisi
commissions, or had your shipments of cotton, tobacco,
ashes, and what not, to Lonldon and Liverpool, been confiscated, and the proceeds poured inlto the English exchequer,
my life upon it, you would never have listened to any
miserable, wire-drawn distinctions between "orders and
decrees affecting our neutral rights," and " municipal decrees," confiscating, in mass, your whole property: you
would have had instant war! The whole land would have
blazed out in war. And shall republicans become the instruments of him who has effaced the title of Attila to the
" scourge of God?"  Yet even Attila, in the fallen fortunes
of civilization, had, no doubt, his advocates, his tools, his
minions, his parasites, in the very countries that he overrun
--sons of that soil, whereon his horse had trod, where grass
could never after grow. If perfectly fresh, instead of being
as I am, my memory clouded, my intellect stupified, my
strength and spirits exhausted, I could not give utterance to
that strong detestation which I feel toward (above all other
works of the creation) such characters as Gengis, Tamerlane,
Kouli Klhan, or Bonaparte. My instincts involuntarily revolt
at their bare idea-malefactors of the human race, who have
ground down man to a mere machine of their impious and
bloody ambition! Yet, under all the accumulated wrongs,
and insults, and robberies of the last of these chieftains, are
we not, in point of fact, about to become a party to his
views, a partner in his wars?
But before this miserable force of ten thousand men is
raised to take Canada, I beg gentlemen to look at the state
of defence at home; to count the cost of the enterprise

before it is set on foot, not when it may be too late; whi n
the best blood of the country shall be spilt, and naught but
empty coffers left to pay the cost. Are the bounty lands
to be given in Canada? It might lessen my repugnance-to
that part of tile system, to granting these lands, not to these
miserable wretches, who sell themselves to slavery for a
few dollars, and a glass of gin, but, in fact, to the clerks in
our offices, some of whom, with an income of fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars, live at the rate of four or five
thousand, and yet grow rich; who, perhaps, at this moment,
are making out blank assign'ments for these land rights. I
beseech the house, before they run their heads against this
post, Quebec, to count the cost. My word for it, Virginia
planters will not be taxed to support such a war-a war
which must aggravate their present distresses-in which
they have not the remotest interest.  Where is the Montgomery, or even the Arnold, or the Burr, who is to march
to the Point Levi?
I call upon those professing to be republicans, to make
good the promises held out by their republican predecessors,
when they caine into power; promises which, for years
afterward, they honestly, faithfully fulfilled. We have
vaunted of paying off the national debt; of retrenching useless establishments, and yet have now become as infatuated
with standing armies, loans, taxes, navies, and war, as ever
were the Essex Junto.                      RANDOLPH.

THE stately homes of England,
How beautiful they stand!
Amid their tall ancestral trees,
O'er all the pleasant land!
The deer across their greensward bound
Through shade and sunny gleam,
And the swan glides past them with the sound
Of some rejoicing stream.
The merry homes of England!
Around their hearths by night,
What gladsome looks of household love
Meet in the ruddy light.
I'here woman's voice flows forth in song
Or childhood's tale is told;
Or lips move tunefully along
Some glorious page of old.
The blessed homes of England!
How softly on their bowers
Is laid the holy quietness
That breathes from Sabbath hours!
Solemn, yet sweet, the church bell's chime
Floats through their woods at morn,
All other sounds in that still time
Of breeze and leaf are born.
The cottage homes of England
By thousands on her plains,
They're smiling o'er the silvery brook,
And round the hamlet fanes.
224Through glowing orchards forth they peep,
Each from its nook of leaves;
And fearless there the lowly sleep,
As the bird beneath their eaves.
The free fair homes of England!
Long, long in hut and hall
May hearts of native proof be rear'd,'I'o guard each hallow'd wall.
And green for ever be the groves,
And bright their flowery sod,
Where first the child's glad spirit loves
Its country and its God.

91.-EXTRACT FROM RODERICK, THE LAST OF THE GOTHS.
A CHRISTIAN woman spinning at lier door
Beheld him, and with sudden pity touch'd,
She laid her spindle by, and running in
Took bread, and following after, call'd him back,
And placing in his passive hands the loaf,
She said, Christ Jesus, for his mother's sake,
Have mercy on thee! With a look that seem'd
Like idiocy he heard her, and stood still,
Staring a while; then bursting into tears
Wept like a child, and thus relieved his heart,
Full even to bursting else with swelling thoughts.
So through the streets, and through the northern gate,
Did Roderick, reckless of a resting-place,
With feeble yet with hurried step pursue
His agitated way; and when he reach'd
The open fields, and found himself alone
Beneath the starry canopy of heaven,
The sense of solitude, so dreadful late,
Was then repose and comfort. There he stopt
Beside a little rill, and brake the loaf;
And shedding o'er that unaccustomed food
Painful but quiet tears, with grateful soul
He breathed thanksgiving forth; then made his bed
On heath and myrtle.                      SOUTHEY.

92.-THE AFRICAN CHIEF.
CHAIN'D in the market-place he stood,
A mall of giant frame,
Amid the gathering multitude
That shrunk to hear his nameAll stern of look and strong of limb,
His dark eye on the ground:And silently they gazed on him,
As on a lion bound.
Vainly, but well, that chief had fought,
He was a captive now,
Yet pride, that fortune humbles not,
Was written on his brow.
The scars hIis dark broad bosom wore,
Show'd warrior true and brave;
A prince among his tribe before,
He could not be a slave.
Then to his conqueror he spake--
"My brother is a king;
Undo this necklace from my neck,
And take this bracelet ring
And send me where my brother reigns,
And I will fill thy hands
With store of ivory from the plains,
And gold-dust from the sands."'Not for thy ivory nor thy gold
Will I unbind thy chain;
That bloody hand shall never hold
The battle spear again.
A price thy nation never gave,
Shall yet be paid for thee;
For thou shalt be the Christian's slave,
In lands beyond the sea."
Then wept the warrior chief, and bade
To shred his locks away;
And, one by one, each heavy braid
Before the victor lay.
Thick were the platted locks, and long,
And deftly hidden there
Shone many a wedge of gold among
The dark and crisped hair.
226Look, feast thy greedy eye with gold
Long kept for sorest need;
Take it-thou askest sums untold,
And sav that I am freed.
Take it--my wife, the long, long day
Weeps by the cocoa tree,
And my young children leave their play,
And ask in vain for me."
"I take thy gold--but I have made
Thy fetters fast and strong,
And ween that by the cocoa shade
Thy wife will wait thee long."
Strong was the agony that shook
The captive's frame to hear,
And the proud meaning of his look
Was changed to mortal fear.
His heart was broken-crazed his brain:
At once his eye grew wild;
He struggled fiercely with his chain,
Whisper'd, and wept, and smiled;
Yet wore not long those fatal bands,
And once, at shut of day,
They drew him forth upon the sands,
The foul hyena's prey.           BRYANT.

2. Placed by Providence on the palaestra of life, every
human being is a wrestler, and happiness is that prize for
which he is bound to contend.
Note.-When the last word of the first part of these sentences
requires the strong emphasis, the falling inflection must be used instead
of the rising.
EXAAMPLE.
Hannibal being frequently destitute of money and provisions, with
no recruits of strength in case of ill fortune, and no encouragement,
even when successful'; it is not to be wondered at that his affairs began
at length to decline.
RULE VI.--Those parts of a sentence which depend on
adjectives require the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. Destitute of the favour of' God', you are in no better
situation, with all your supposed abilities, than orphans left
to wander in a trackless desert.
2. Full of spirit, and high in hope', we set out on the
journey of life.
INVERTED PERIOD.RULE VII.-Every inverted period requires the rising
inflection and long pause between its two principal constructive parts.
EXAMPLES.
1. Persons of good taste expect to be pleased', at the
same time they are informed.
3. I can desire to perceive those things that God has
prepared for those that love' him, though they be such as
eye hath not seen, ear heard, nor hath it entered into the
heart of man to conceive.
Sentences constructed like the following also fall under this rule.
3. Poor were the expectations of the studious, the

94.-SPEECH OF JOHN C. CALHOIUN, IN THE HOUSE OE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES, DECEMBER, 12, 1811,
On the second resolution reported by the committee of foreign relations,
" That an additional force of ten thousand regular troops ought to be
immediately raised, to serve for three years; and that a bounty in
lands ought to be given to encourage enlistment."
MR. SPEAKER,-I understood the opinion of the committee of foreign relations differently from what the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Randolph) has stated to be his impression. I certainly understood that committee as recommending the measures now before the house, as a preparation for
war; and such, in fact, was its express resolve, agreed to,
I believe, by every member except that gentleman.  I do
not attribute any wilful misstatement to him, but consider
228it the effect of inadvertency or mistake. Indeed, the report
could mean nothing but war or empty menace. I hope'no
member of this house is in favour of the latter. A bullying,
menacing system has every thing to condemn, and nothing
to recommend it: in expense it is almost as considerable as
war; it excites contempt abroad, and destroys confidence
here. Menaces are serious things, and if we expect any
good from them, they ought to be resorted to with as much
caution and seriousness, as war itself; and should, if not
successful, be invariably followed by it. It was not the
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Grundy) that made this a
war question. The resolve contemplates an additional,
regular force: a measure confessedly improper, but as a
preparation for war, but undoubtedly necessary in that event.
Sir, I am not insensible of the weighty importance of this
question, for the first time submitted to this house, as a
redress of our long list of complaints against one of the
belligerents; but, according to my mode of thinking on this
subject, however serious the question, whenever I am on
its affirmative side, my conviction must be strong and unalterable. War, in this country, ought never to be resorted
to but when it is clearly justifiable and necessary; so much
so as not to require the aid of logic to convince our reason,
or the ardour of eloquence to inflame our passions. There
are many reasons why this country should never resort to
war but for causes the most urgent and necessary. It is
sufficient that, under a government like ours, none but such
will justify it in the eye of the nation; and, were I not satisfied that such is our present cause, I certainly would be no
advocate of the proposition now before the house.
Sir, I prove the war, should it ensue, justifiable, by the express admission of the gentleman from Virginia; and necessary, by facts undoubted, and universally admitted-such as
that gentleman did not pretend to controvert. The extent,
duration, and character of the injuries received; the failure
of those peaceful.means, heretofore resorted to for the redress
of our wrongs, is my proof that it is necessary. Why should
I mention the impressment of our seamen; depredation on
every branch of our commerce, including the direct export
trade, continued for years, and made under laws which
professedly undertake to regulate our trade with other
nations; negotiations resorted to, time after time, till it is
20
229
CALHOUN.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
become hopeless; the restrictive system persisted in, to
avoid war, and in the vain expectation of returning
justice? The evil still grows, and in each succeeding
year, swells in extent and pretension beyond the preceding.
The question, even in the opinion and admission of our
opponents, is reduced to this single point--which shall we
do, abandon or defend our own commercial and maritime
rights, and the personal liberties of our citizens employed
in exerting them? These rights are essentially attacked,
and war is the only means of redress. The gentleman from
Virginia has suggested none, unless we consider the whole
of his speech as recommending patient and resigned submission as the best remedy. Sir, which alternative this
house ought to embrace, it is not for me to say. I hope the
decision is made already, by a higher authority than the
voice of any man. It is not for the humall tongue to instil
the sense of independence and honour. This is the work
of nature-a generous nature that disdains tame submission
to wrongs.
This part of the subject is so imposing, as to enforce
silence even on the gentleman from Virginia. He dared
not to deny his country's wrongs, or vindicate the conduct
of her enemy.
Only one point of that gentleman's argument had any, the
most remote, relation to this point. He would not say, we
had not a good cause of war; but insisted that it was our duty
to define that cause. If he means that this house ought, at
this stage of the proceeding, or any other, to enumerate
such violations of our rights, as we are willing to contend
for, he prescribes a course, which neither good sense nor
the usage of nations warrants. When we contend, let us
contend for all our rights-the doubtful and the certain, the
unimportant and essential. It is as easy to struggle, or
even more so, for the whole, as a part. At the termination
of the contest, secure all that our wisdom and valour and
the fortune of the war will permit. This is the dictate of
common sense; such also is the usage of nations. The
single instance alluded to, the endeavour of Mr. Fox to compel Mr. Pitt to define the object of the war against France,
will not support the gentleman from Virginia in his position.
That was an extraordinary war for an extraordinary purpose, and could not be governed by the usual rules. It
230was not for conquest, or for redress of injury, but to impose
a government on France, which she refused to receive; an
object so detestable, that an avowal dare not be made.
Sir, here I might rest the question. The affirmative of
the proposition is established. I cannot but advert, however, to the complaint of the gentleman from Virginia, the
first time he was up on this question. He said, he found
himself reduced to the necessity of supporting the negative
side of the question before the affirmative was established.
Let me tell that gentleman, that there is no hardship in his
case. It is not every affirmative that ought to be proved.
Were I to affirm, the house is now in session, would it be
reasonable to ask for proof?  He who would deny its truth,
on him would be the proof of so extraordinary a negative.
How then could the gentleman, after his admissions, with
the facts before him and the nation, complain? The causes
are such as to warrant, or rather make it indispensable in
any nation, not absolutely dependent, to defend its rights
by force. Let him then, show, the reasons why we ought
not so to defend ourselves. On him, then, is the burden
of proof. This he has attempted; he has endeavoured to
support his negative.
Before I proceed to answer the gentleman particularly,
let me call the attention of the house to one circumstance;
that is, that almnost the whole of his arguments consisted of
an enumeration of evils always incident to war, however
just and necessary; and that, if they have any force, it is
calculated to produce unqualified submission to every
species of insult and injury. I do not feel myself bound to
answer arguments of the above description; and if I should
touch on them, it will be only incidentally, and not for the
purpose of serious refutation. The first argument of the
gentleman which I shall notice, is the unprepared state of
the country.  Whatever weight this argument might have,
in a question of immediate war, it surely has little in that
of preparation for it. If our country is unprepared, let us
remedy the evil as soon as possible. Let the gentleman
submit his plan; and if a reasonable one, I doubt not it
will be supported by the house. But, sir, let us admit the
fact and the whole force of the argument; I ask whose is
the fault? Who has been a member for many years past,
and has seen the defenceless state of his country even near
231
CALHOUN.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
home, under his own eyes, without a single endeavour to
remedy so serious an evil?  Let him not say, "I have
acted in a minority." It is no less the duty of the minority
than a majority to endeavour to serve our country. For
that purpose we are sent here, and not for that of opposition.  We are next told of the expenses of the war, and
that the people will not pay taxes. Why not? Is it a want
of capacity? What, with one million tons of shipping; a
trade of near one hundred million dollars; manufactures
of one hundred and fifty million dollars, and agriculture of
thrice that amount, shall we be told the country wants
capacity to raise and support ten thousand or fifteen thousand additional regulars? No; it has the ability, that is
admitted; but will it not have the disposition? Is not the
course a just and necessary one? Shall we then utter this
libel on the nation? Where will proof be found of a fact
so disgraceful?  It is said, in the history of the country
twelve or fifteen years ago. The case is not parallel. The
ability of the country has greatly increased since. The
object of that tax was unpopular. But on this, as well as
my memory and almost infant observation at that time serve
me, the objection was not to the tax, or its amount, but the
mode of collection.'rhe eye of the nation was frightened
by the number of officers; its love of liberty shocked with
the multiplicity of regulations. We, in the vile spirit of
imitation, copied from the most oppressive part of European laws on that subject,;and imposed on a young and
virtuous nation all the severe provisions made necessary by
corruption and long growing chicane. If taxes should become necessary, I do not hesitate to say the people will pay
cheerfully. It is for their government and their cause, and
would be their interest and duty to pay. But it may be,
and I believe was said, that the nation will not pay taxes,
because the rights violated are not worth defending; or that
the defence will cost more than the profit.
Sir, I here enter my solemn protest against this low
"calculating avarice" entering this hall of legislation. It
is only fit for shops and counting-houses, and ought not tco
disgrace the seat of sovereignty by its squalid and vile appearance. Whenever it touches sovereign power, the nation
is ruined. It is too short-sighted to defend itself. It is an
unpromising spirit, always ready to yield a part to save the
232balance. It is too timid to have in itself the laws of selfpreservation. It is never safe but under the shield of honour.
Sir, I only know of one principle to make a nation great,
to produce in this country not tile form but real spirit of
union, and that is, to protect every citizen in the lawful
pursuit of his-business. He will then feel that he is backed
by the government-that its arm is his arms, and will
rejoice in its increased strength and prosperity. Protection
and patriotism are reciprocal. This is the road that all
great nations have trod. Sir, I am not versed in this calculating policy, and will not, therefore, pretend to estimate
in dollars and cents the value of national independence or
national affection. I cannot dare to measure in shillings
and pence the misery, the stripes and the slavery of our imnpressed seamen; nor even to value our shipping, commercial and agricultural losses under the orders in council and
the British system of blockade. I hope I have not condemned any prudent estimate of the means of a country,
before it enters on a war. This is wisdom, the other folly.
95.-CONCLUSION OF THE SAME SPEECH.
MR. SPEAKER,--The gentleman fromVirginia has not failed
to touch on the calamity of war-that fruitful source of declamation, by which pity becomes the advocate of cowardice; but I know not what we have to do with that subject.
If the gentleman desires to repress the gallant ardour of our
countrymen by such topics, let me inform him that true
courage regards only the cause, that it is just and necessary,
and that it despises the pain and danger of war. If he
really wishes to promote the cause of humanity, let his
eloquence be addressed to Lord Wellesley or Mr. Perceval,
and not the American congress. Tell them, if they persist
in such daring insult and injury to a neutral nation, that,
however inclined to peace, it will be found in honour and
interest to resist; that their patience and benevolence, however great, will be exhausted; that the calamity of war
will ensue, and that they, in the opinion of wounded humanity, will be answerable for all its devastation and misery.
Let melting pity, a regard to the interests of humanity, stay
the hand of injustice, and my life on it, the gentleman will
20O
233
CALHOUN.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
not find it difficult to call off his country from the bloody
scenes of war.  We are-next told of the danger of war! I
believe we are all ready to acknowledge its hazard and
accidents; but I cannot think we have any extraordinary
danger to contend with, at least so much as to warrant an
acquiescence in the injuries we have received; on the contrary, I believe no war can be less dangerous to internal
peace or national existence.  But we are told of the black
population of the southern states. As far as the gentleman
from Vriginia speaks of his own personal knowledge, I will
not pretend to contradict hini; I only regret that such is
the dreadful state of his particular part of the country.  Of
the southern section, I too have some personal knowledge,
and can say, that in South Carolina no such fears in any
part are felt. But, sir, admit the gentleman's statement;
will a war with Great Britain increase the danger? Will
the country be less able to repress insurrection? Had we
any thing to fear from that quarter, which I sincerely disbelieve, in my opinion, the precise time of the greatest
safety is during a war, in which we have no fear of invasion; then the country is most on its giuard; our militia
the best prepared; and standing force the greatest.  Even
in our revolution, no attempts were made by that portion
of our population; and, however the gentleman may frighten
himself with the disorganizing effects of French principles,
1 cannot think our ignorant blacks have felt much of their
baneful influence. I dare say, more than one half of them
never heard of the French revolution.  But as great as is
the danger from our slaves, the gentleman's fears end not
there--the standing army is not less terrible to him.
Sir, I think a regular force, raised for a period of actual
hostilities, cannot be called a standing army.  There is a
just distinction between such a force, and one raised as a
peace establishment. Whatever may be the composition
of the latter, I hope the former will consist of some of the
best materials of' the country. The ardent patriotism of
our young men, and the reasonable bounty in land, which is
proposed to be given, will impel them to join their country's standard and to fight her battles; they will not forget
the citizen in the soldier, and, in obeying their officer, learn
to contemn their constitution.  In our officers and soldiers
we will find patriotism no less pure and ardent than in the
234private citizen; but if they should be depraved as represented, what have we to fear from twenty-five or thirty thousand
regulars? Where will be the boasted militia of the gentleman? Can one million of militia be overpowered by thirty
thousand regulars? If so, how canl we rely on them against
a foe invading our country?  Sir, I have no such contemptuous idea of our militia; their untaught bravery is
sufficient to crush all foreign and internal attempts on their
country's liberties. But we have not yet come to the end
of the chapter of dangers. The gentleman's imagination,
so fruitful on this subject,, conceives, that our constitution
is not calculated for war, and that it cannot stand its rude
shock. This is rather extraordinary: we must then depend
upon the pity or contempt of other nations for our existence. The constitution, it seems, has failed in its essential
part " to provide for the common defence." No, says the
gentleman from Virginia, it is competent for a defensive,
but not an offensive war. It is not necessary for me to
expose the error of this opinion. Why make the distinction in this instance? Will he pretend to say, that this is
an offensive war; or war of conquest? Yes, the gentleman has dared to make this assertion, and for reasons no
less extraordinary than the assertion itself. He says our
rights are violated on the ocean, and that these violations
affect our shipping and commercial rights, to which the
Canadas have no relation. T'he doctrine of retaliation has
been much abused of late by an unnatural extension; we
have now to witness a new abuse. The gentleman from
Virginia has limited it down to a point. By his systemn, if you
receive a blow on the breast, you dare not return it on the
head; you are obliged to measure and return it on the precise point on which it was received. If you do not proceed with this mathematical accuracy, it ceases to be just
self-defence; it becomes an unprovoked attack.
In speaking of Canada, the gentleman from Virginia introduced the name of Montgomery with much feeling and
interest. Sir, there is danger in tllat name to the gentleman's argument. It is sacred to heroism! It is indignant
of submission! This calls my memory back to the time
of our revolution; to the congress of'74 and'75. Suppose
a speaker of that day had risen and urged all the arguments
which we have heard on this subject; had told that con

gress, " Your contest is about the right of laying a tax; the
attempt on Canada has nothing to do with it; the war will
be expensive; danger and devastation will overspread our
country, and the power of Great Britain is irresistible?"
With what sentiment, think you,would such doctrines have
been then received? Happy for us, they had no force at that
period of our country's glory. Had they been then acted
on, this hall would never have witnessed a great nation convened to deliberate for the general good; a mighty empire,
with prouder prospects than any nation the sun ever shone
on, would not have risen in the West.  No, we would have
been vile, subjected colonies; governed by that imperious
rod which Britain holds over her distant provinces. Sir,
the gentleman from Virginia attributes the preparation for
war to every thing but its true cause. He endeavoured to
find it in the probable rise of the price of hemp. He represents the people of the western states as willing to plunge
our country into war, for such base and precarious motives.
I will not reason on this point. I see the cause of their
ardour, not in such base motives, but in their known patriotism and disinterestedness. No less mercenary is the
reason which he attributes to the southern states. He says
that the non-importation act has reduced cotton to nothing,
which has produced a feverish impatience. Sir, I acknowledge the cotton of our farms is worth but little, but not for
the cause assigned by the gentleman from Virginia.  The
people of that section do not reason as he does; they do
not attribute it to the efforts of their government to maintain
the peace and independence of their country; they see in
the low price of their produce-the hand of foreign injustice;
they know well, without the marlket of the continent, the
deep and steady current of supply will glut that of Great
Britain; they are not prepared for the colonial state to
which again that power is endeavouring to reduce us. The
manly spirit of that section of our country will not submit
to be regulated by any foreign power.'I'he love of France and the hatred of England has also
been assigned as the caus:, f the present measures. France
lhas not done us justice, says the gentleman from Virginia,
and how can we, without partiality, resist the aggressions
of Englandl? I know, sir, we have still causes of complaint
against France: but it is of a different character from those
236against England. She professes now to respect our rights,
and thlere cannot be a reasonable doubt, but that the most
objectionable parts of her decrees, as far as they respect us,
are repealed. We have already formally acknowledged
this to be a fact. I, however, protest against the whole
of the principles on which this doctrine is founded. It is a
novel doctrine, and nowhere to be found out of this house,
that you cannot select your antagonist without being guilty
of partiality. Sir, when two invade your rights, you may
resist both, or either, at your pleasure. It is regulated by
prudence, and not by right. The stale imputation of partiality to France is better calculated for the columns of a
newspaper than for the walls of this house. I ask, in this
particular, of the gentleman from Virginia, but for the same
measure which he claims for himself. That gentleman is
at a loss to account for, What he calls, our hatred to England. He asks, How can we hate the country of Locke, of
Newton, Hampden and Chathlam; a country having the
same language and customs with ourselves, and descending
from a common ancestry? Sir, the laws of human affections are uniform. If we have so much to attach us to that
country, powerful, indeed, must be the cause which has
overpowered it.
Yes, sir, tilere is a cause strong enough.  Not that
occult, courtly affection, which he has supposed to be entertained for France; but it is to be found in continued and
unprovoked insult and injury-a cause so manifest, that the
gentleman from Virginia had to exert much ingenuity to
overlook it. But, sir, here I think the gentleman, in his
eager admiration of that country, has not been sufficiently
guarded in his argument. Has he reflected on the cause of
that admiration? Has he examined the reasons of our high
regard for her Chatham? It is his ardent patriotism; the
heroic courage of his mind, that could not brook the least
insult or injury offered to his country, but thought that her
interest and honour ought to be vindicated at every hazard
and expense. I hope, when we are called on to admire,

does not wish a monopoly of those great virtues to reniain

1. The most frightful disorders arose from the state of

power', and the nobles without principle. They were
tyrants at home', and robbers abroad. Nothing remained
to be a check upon ferocity and violence.
2. Between fame and true honour a distinction is to be
made. The former is a blind and noisy' applause; the
latter a more silent and internal homage. Fame floats on
the breath of the multitude': honour rests on the judgment
of the thinking. Fame may give praise, while it withholds
esteem': true honour implies esteem, mingled with respect

22THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
There is, sir, one great error in our legislation.  We are
ready enough to protect the interest of the states; and, it
should seem, from this argument, to watch over those of a
foreign nation, while we grossly neglect our own imnmediate
concerns. This argument of the balance of power is well
calculated for the British parliament, but not at all fitted to
the American congress. Tell them, that thley hiave to contend with a mighty power, and that if they persist in insult
and injury to the American people, they will compel them
to throw the whole weight of their force into the scale of
their enemy. Paint the danger to them, and if they will
desist from injury, we, I answer for it, will not disturb the
balance. But it is absurd for us to talk of the balance of
power, while they, by their conduct, smile with contempt
at our simple, good-natured policy. If, however, in the
contest, it should be found, that they underrate us, which I
hope and believe, and that we can effect the balance of
power, it will not be difficult for us to obtain such terms as
our rights demand. 1, sir, will now conclude, by adverting
to an argument of the gentleman from Virginia, used in
debate on a preceding day. He asked, why not declare
war immediately? The answer is obvious; because we
are not yet prepared. But, says the gentleman, such language as is here held, will provoke Great Britain to commence hostilities. I have no such fears. She knows well,
that such a course would unite all parties here; a thing,
which, above all others, she most dreads. Besides, such
has been our past conduct, that she will still calculate on
our patience and submission till war is actually commenced.

OUR band is few, but true and tried,
Our leader frank and bold;
The British soldier trembles
When Marion's name is told.
Our fortress is the good green wood,
Our tent the cypress tree;
We know the forest round us,
As seamen know the sea.
238BRYANT.
We know its walls of thorny vines,
Its glades of reedy grass,
Its safe and silent islands
Within the dark morass.
Wo to the English soldiery
That little dread us near!
On them shall light at midnight
A strange and sudden fear:
When waking to their tents on fire
They grasp their arms in vain,
And they who stand to face us
Are beat to earth again;
And they who fly in terror deem
A mighty host behind,
And hear the tramp of thousands
Upon the hollow wind.
Then sweet the hour that brings release
From danger and from toil:
We talk the battle over,
And share the battle's spoil.
The woodland rings with laugh and shout,
As if a hunt were up,
And woodland flowers are gathered
To crown the soldier's cup.
With merry songs we mock the wind
That in the pine-top grieves,
And slumber long and sweetly,
On beds of oaken leaves.
Well knows the fair and friendly moon
The band that Marion leads--
The glitter of their rifles,
The scampering of their steeds.'Tis life our fiery barbs to guide
Across the moonlight plains;'Tis life to feel the night wind
That lifts their tossing manes.
A moment in the British camp--
A moment-and away
Back to the pathless forest,
Before the peep of day.

Alone can front the blaze of day,
And, wandering through the radiant sky,
Ne'er from the sunlight turns away;
Whose ample wing was made to rise
Majestic o'er the loftiest peak,
On whose chill tops the winter skies,
Around thy nest, in tempests speak.
What ranger of the winds can dare,
Proud mountain king! with thee compare;
Or lift his gaudier plumes on high
Before thy native majesty,
When thou hast ta'en thy seat alone,
Upon thy cloud-encircled throne?
Bird of the cliffs! thy noble form
Might well be thought almost divine;
Born for the thunder and the storm,
The mountain and the rock are thine;
And there, where never foot has been.,
Thy eyry is sublimely hung,
Where lowering skies their wrath begin,
And loudest lullabies are sung
By the fierce spirit of the blast,
When, his snow mantle o'er him cast,
He sweeps across the mountain top,
With a dark fury naught can stop,
And wings his wild unearthly way
Far through the clouded realms of day.

Bird of the sun! to thee--to thee
The earliest tints of dawn are known,
And'tis thy proud delight to see
The monarch mount his gorgeous throne;
Throwing the crimson drapery by,
That half impedes his glorious way;
And mounting up the radiant sky,
E'en what he is,--the king of day!
Before the regent of the skies
Men shrink, and veil their dazzled eyes;
But thou, in regal mnajesty,
Hast kingly rank as well as he;
And with a steady, dauntless gaze,
Thou meet'st the splendour of his blaze.

An emblem of our native land;
With unblench'd front and noble brow,
Among the nations doom'd to stand;

Like her own rivers, wandering free;
And sending forth, from hills and floods,
The joyous shout of liberty!
Like thee, majestic bird! like thee,
She stands in unbought majesty,
With spreading wing,' untired and strong,
That dares a soaring far and long,
That mounts aloft, nor looks below,
And will not quail though tempests blow.
The admiration of the earth,
In grand simplicity she stands;
Like thee, the storms beheld her birth,
And she was nursed by rugged hands;
But, past the fierce and furious war,
Her rising fame new glory brings,
For kings and nobles come from far
To seek the shelter of her wings.
And like thee, rider of the cloud,
She mounts the heavens serene and proud,
Great in a pure and noble frame,
Great in her spotless champion's name,

To whom my thoughts will fondly turn:
For her the warmest hopes expand,
For her the heart with fears will yearn.
O! may she keep her eye, like thee,
Proud eagle of the rocky wild,
Fix'd on the sun of liberty,
By rank, by faction unbeguiled;
Remembering still the rugged road
Our venerable fathers trod,
When they through toil and danger press'd,
To gain their glorious bequest,
And from each lip the caution fell
To those who follow'd, " Guard it well."

Where even grief is half subdued:
And Peace, the halcyon, loves to brood.

Shrine of my household deities!
Fair scene of my home's unsullied joys

When fortune frowns, or care annoys:

100.-THE INDIAN HUNTER.
WHEN the summer harvest was gather'd in,
And the sheaf of the gleaner grew white and thin,
And the ploughshare was in its furrow left
Where the stubble land had been lately cleft,
An Indian hunter, with unstrung bow,
Look'd down where the valley lay stretch'd below.
He was a stranger, and all that day
Had been out on the hills, a perilous way,
But the foot of the deer was far and fleet,
And the wolf kept aloof from the hunter's feet,
And bitter feelings pass'd o'er him then,
As he stood by the populous haunts of men.
The winds of autumn came over the woods
As the sun stole out from their solitudes,
The moss was white on the maple's trunk,
And dead from its arms the pale vine shrunk,
And ripen'd the mellow fruit hung, and red
Were the tree's wither'd leaves round it shed.
The foot of the reaper moved slow on the lawn,
And the sickle cut down the yellow cornThe mower sung loud by the meadow side,
Where the mists of evening were spreading wide,
And the voice of the herdsman came up the lea,
And the dance went round by the greenwood tree.
Then the hunter turn'd away from that scene,
Where the home of his fathers once had been,
And heard by the distant and measured stroke,
That the woodman hew'd down the giant oak,
And burning thoughts flash'd o'er his mind
Of the white man's faith, and love unkind.
246LONGFELLOW-EVERETT.
The moon of the harvest grew high and bright,
As her golden horn pierced the cloud of whiteA footstep was heard in the rustling bralie,
Where the beach o'ershadow'd the misty lake,
And a mourning voice and a plunge from shore;
And the hunter was seen on the hills no more.
Wihen years had pass'd on, by that still lake-side
The fisher look'd down through the silver tide,
And there, on the smooth yellow sand display'd,
A skeleton wasted and white was laid,
And'twas seen, as the waters moved deep and slow,
That the hand was still grasping a hunter's bow.
LONGFELLOW.
101.-THE EXAMPLE OF THE NORTHERN TO THE SOUTHERN
REPUBLICS OF AMERICA.
THE great triumphs of constitutional freedom, to which
our independence has furnished the example, have been
witnessed in the southern portion of our hemisphere.
Sunk to the last point of colonial degradation, they have
risen at once into the organization of three republics.
Their struggle has been arduous; and eighteen years of
checkered fortune have not yet brought it to a close. But
we must not infer, from their prolonged agitation, that their
independence is uncertain; that they have prematurely put
on the toga virilis of freedom. They have not begun too
soon; they have more to do. Our war of independence
was shorter;-happily we were contending with a government, that could not, like that of Spain, pursue an interminable and hopeless contest, in defiance of the people's
will. Our transition to a mature and well adjusted constitution was more prompt than that of our sister republics;
for the foundations had long been settled, the preparation
long made. And when we consider that it is our example,
which has aroused the spirit of independence from California to Cape Horn; that the experiment of liberty, if it had
failed with us, most surely would not have been attempted by
them; that even now our counsels and acts will operate as
powerful precedents in this great family of republics, we
learn the importance of the post which Providence has

3. These two qualities, delicacy and correctness, mutually imply each other. No taste can be exquisitely delicate
without being correct; nor can be thoroughly correct without being delicate. But still a predominancy of one or other
quality, in the mixture is often visible. The power of
delicacy is chiefly seen in discerning the true' merit of a
work; the power of correctness, in rejecting false pretensions to merit. Delicacy leans more to feeling'; correctness more to reason and judgment. The former is more
the gift of nature; the latter, more the product of culture and art. Among the ancient critics, Longinus possessed most delicacy'; Aristotle most correctness. Among
the moderns, Mr. Addison is a high example of delicate'
taste; Dean Swift, had he written on the subject of criticism, would perhaps have afforded the example of a correct
one.

RULE X.--i-t the end of a concession the rising inflection

EXAMPLES.
1. Reason, eloquence, and every art which ever has been
studied among mankind, may be abused, and may prove
dangerous in the hands of bad' men; but it were perfectly
childish to contend, that, upon this account, they ought to be
abolished.
2. One may be a speaker, both of much reputation and
much influence, in the calm argumentative' manner. To
attain the pathetic, and the sublime of oratory, requires
those strong sensibilities of mind, and that high power of
expression, which are given to few.
3. To Bourdaloue, the French critics attribute more
solidity and close reasoning; to Massillon, a more pleasing
and engaging manner. Bourdaloue is indeed a great reasoner, and inculcates his doctrines with Inuch zeal, piety,
and earnestness'; but his style is verbose, he is disagreeably full of quotations from the fathers, and he wants
imagination.
23assigned us in the world. A. wise and harmonious administration of the public affairs,-a faithful, liberal, and patriotic
exercise of the private duties of the citizen,-while they
secure our happiness at home, will diffuse a healthful influence through the channels of national communication, and
serve the cause of liberty beyond the Equator and the
Andes. When we show a united, conciliatory, and imposing
front to their rising states, we show them, better than sounding eulogies can do, the true aspect of an independent
republic; we give them a living example that the fireside
policy of a people is like that of the individual man. As
the one, commencing in the prudence, order, and industry
of the private circle, extends itself to all the duties of social
life, of the family, the neighbourhood, the country; so
the true domestic policy of the republic, beginning in the
wise organization of its own institutions, pervades its territories with a vigilant, prudent, temperate administration;
and extends the hand of cordial interest to all the friendly
nations, especially to those which are of the household of
liberty.
It is in this way that we are to fulfil our destiny in
the world. The greatest engine of moral power, which
human nature knows, is an organized, prosperous state.
All that man, in his individual capacity, can do-all that
he can effect by his fraternities-by his ingenious discoveries and wonders of art,-or by his influence over
others-is as nothing, compared with the collective, perpetuated influence on human affairs and human happiness of
a well constituted, powerful commonwealth. It blesses
generations with its sweet influence;-even the barren earth
seems to pour out its fruits under a system where property
is secure, while her fairest g-ardens are blighted by despotism;-men, thinking, reasoning men, abound beneath its
benignant sway;-nature enters into a beautiful accord, a
better, purer asiento with man, and guides anl industrious
citizen to every rood of her smiling wastes;--and we see,
at length, that what has been called a state of nature, has
been most falsely, calumniously so denominated; that the
nature of man is neither that of a savage, a hermit, nor a
slave; but that of a member of a well ordered family, that
of a good neighbour, a free citizen, a well informed, good
man, acting with others like him. This is the lesson which
248
THE AMERICAN SPE~AKER.is taught in the charter of our independence; this is the
lesson which our example is to teach the world.
The epic poet of Rome-the faithful subject of an absolute prince--in unfolding the duties and destinies of his
countrymen, bids them look down with disdain on the
polished and intellectual arts of Greece, and deem their arts
to be
To rule the nations with imperial sway;
To spare the tribes that yield; fight down the proud;
And force the mood of peace upon the world.
A nobler counsel breathes from the charter of our independence; a happier province belongs to our republic.  Peace
we would extend, but by persuasion and example,-the
moral force, by which alone it can prevail among the
nations. Wars we may encounter, but it is in the sacred character of the injured and the wronged; to raise the trampled
rights of humanity from the dust; to rescue the mild form
of liberty from her abode among the prisons and the scaffolds of the elder world, and to seat her in the chair of state
among her adoring children; to give her beauty for ashes;
a healthful action for her cruel agony; to put at last a period
to her warfare on earth; to tear her star-spangled banner
from the perilous ridges of battle, and plant it on the rock
of ages.  There be it fixed for ever,-the power of a free
people slumbering in its folds, their peace reposing in its
shade!                                    E. EVERETT.
102.-CLOSE OF THE SPEECH OF DANIEL WEBSTER ON THE
GREEK QUESTION, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE UNITED STATES, JANUARY, 1824.
The house had gone into committee of the whole, Mr. Taylor in
the chair, on the resolution offered by Mr. Webster, which is in the
words following:
"Resolved, That provision ought to be made by law for defraying the
expense incident to the appointment of an agent, or commissioner, to
Greece, whenever the president shall deem it expedient to make such
appointfnent."
MR. CHAIRMAN,-It may be asked, will this resolution
do the Greeks any good? Yes, it will do them much good.
It will give them courage and spirit, which is better than
money. It will assure them of the public sympathy, and
249
EVERETT-WEBSTER.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
will inspire them with fresh constancy. It will teach them
that they are not forgotten by the civilized world, and to
hope one day to occupy, in that world, an honourable
station.
A farther question remains. Is this measure pacific? It
has no other character. It simply proposes to make- a
pecuniary provision for a mission, when the president shall
deem such mission expedient. It is a mere reciprocation
to the sentiments of his message; it imposes upon him no
new duty; it gives him no new power; it does not hasten
or urge him forward; it simply provides, in an open and
avowed manner, the means of doing, what would else be
done out of the contingent fund. It leaves him at the most
perfect liberty, and it reposes the whole matter in his sole
discretion. He might do it without this resolution, as he
did in the case of South America,-but it merely answers
the query, whether on so great and interesting a question
as the condition of the Greeks, this house holds no opinion
which is worth expressing? But, suppose a commissioner
is sent, the measure is pacific still. Where is the breach
of neutrality? Where a just cause of offence? And besides, Mr. Chairinan, is all the danger in this matter on one
side? may we not inquire, whose fleets cover the Archipelago? may we not ask, what would be the result to our
trade should $Smyrna be blockaded? A commissioner could
at least procure for us what we do not now possess-that
is, authentic information of the true state of things. The
document on your table exhibits a meagre appearance on
this point-what does it contain? Letters of Mr. Luriottis
and paragraphs from a French paper. My personal opinion
is, that an agent ought immediately to be sent; but the
resolution I have offered by no means goes so far.
Do gentlemen fear the result of this resolution in embroiling us with the Porte?  Why, sir, how much is it ahead
of the whole nation, or rather let me ask how much is the
nation ahead of it? Is not this whole people already in a
state of open and avowed excitement on this subject? Does
not the land ring from side to side with one common sentiment of sympathy for Greece, and indignation toward her
oppressors? nay, more, sir-are we not giving money to
this cause? More still, sir-is not the secretary of state in
open correspondence with the president of the Greek comn250mittee in London? The nation has gone as far as it can
go, short of an official act of hostility. This resolution
adds nothing beyond what is already done-nor can any
of the European governments take offence at such a measure. But if they would, should we be withheld from an
honest expression of liberal feelings in the cause of freedom,
for fear of giving umbrage to some member of the holy
alliance? We are not, surely, yet prepared to purchase
their smiles by a sacrifice of every manly principle. Dare
any Christian prince even ask us not to sympathize with a
Christian nation struggling against T'artar tyranny? We
do not interfere--we break no engagements-we violate no
treaties; with the Porte we have none.
Mr. Chairman, there are some things which, to be well
done, must be promptly done. If we even determine to do
the thing that is now proposed, we may do it too late.
Sir, I am not of those who are for withholding aid when it
is most urgently needed, and when the stress is past, and
the aid no longer necessary, overwhelming the sufferers
with caresses. I will not stand by and see my fellow man
drowning without stretching out a hand to help him, till he
has by his own efforts and presence of mind reached the
shore in safety, and then encumber him with aid. With
suffering Greece now is the crisis of her fate,-her great, it
nay be, her last struggle. Sir, while we sit here deliberating, her destiny may be decided. The Greeks, contending
with ruthless oppressors, turn their eyes to us, and invoke
us by their ancestors, slaughtered wives and children, by
their own blood, poured out like water, by the hecatombs
of dead they have heaped up as it were to heaven, they
invoke, they implore us for some cheering sound, some
look of sympathy, some token of compassionate regard.
They look to us as the great republic of the earth-and
they ask us by our common faith, whether we can forget
that they are struggling, as we once struggled, for what we
now so happily enjoy? I cannot say, sir, that they will
succeed; that rests with heaven. But for myself, sir, if I
should to-morrow hear that they have failed-that their last
phalanx had sunk beneath the Turkish cimeter, that the
flames of their last city had sunk in its ashes, and that
naught remained but the wide melancholy waste where
Greece once was, I should still reflect, with the most heart

103.-MR. POINSETT'S SPEECH ON THE SAME QUESTION.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-To    view this question calmly and
dispassionately as a statesman ought to do, requires us to
exercise the utmost control over our feelings.
It is impossible to contemplate the contest between the
Greeks and the Turks, so eloquently described by the gentleman from Massachusetts, without feeling the strongest
indignation at the barbarous atrocities committed by the
infidel oppressor, and the deepest interest in the cause of a
brave people struggling alone, against fearful odds, to shake
off the yoke of despotismn.
Our sympathies are always with the oppressed--our
feelings are always engaged in the cause of liberty. In
favour of Greece, they are still more strongly excited by
recollections, which the scholar cherishes with delight, and
which are associated in our minds with every pure and
exalted sentiment.
The descendants of that illustrious people, to whom we
owe our arts, our sciences, and, except our religion, every
thing which gives a charm to life, must command our
warmest interest: but the Greeks have other claims to oul
sympathies. They are not only heirs of the immortal fame
of their ancestors-they are the rivals of their virtues. In
their heroic struggle for freedom, they have exhibited a
persevering courage, a spirit of enterprise, and a contempt
of danger and of suffering worthy the best days of ancient
Greece. The enthusiasm and liberality manifested in their
cause, by our fellow citizens throughout the union, are, in
the highest degree, honourable to their feelings. As men,
we must applaud their generosity, and may imitate their
example. But the duty of a statesman is a stern duty. As
representatives of the people, we have no right to indulge
our sympathies, however noble, or to give way to our feeling, however generous. We are to regard only the policy of
a measure submitted to our consideration. Our first and
most important duty is, to maintain peace, whenever that
252can be done consistently with the honour and safety of the
nation; and we ought to be slow to adopt any measure
which might involve us in a war, except where those great
interests are concerned. The gentleman disclaims any such
intention. He does not believe that we run the slightest
risk, by adopting the resolution on our table. He considers
it as a pacific measure, and relies entirely upon the discretion of the president, to accept or reject our recommendation,
as the interests of the country may require.'The object
of passing such a resolution can only be to give an impulse
to the executive, and to induce him, by an expression of
the opinion of this house, to send a commission to Greece.
I have as great a reliance upon the discretion of the executive
as the gentleman from Massachusetts. I believe that he
would resist the suggestion of this house in favour of any
measure if he thought the public interest required him to do
so. But, unless we wish and expect him to act upon our recommendation, we ought not to throw upon him, alone, the
responsibility of resisting the strong public feeling, which
has been excited on this subject. The question for us to
consider appears to me to be, whether, if the power rested
with us, we would exercise it to this extent. I think we
could not do so, without incurring some risk of involving
the country in a war foreign to its interests. Let us suppose that these commissioners were to fall into the hands
of the Turks; an event by no means impossible, in the present state of Greece- what would be their fate? The Porte
has not been remarkable for its strict observance of the laws
of nations, in its intercourse with the powers of Europe; and
it is not probable, that such a court would be very scrupulous in its conduct toward a nation whose flag it has never
acknowledged. Or, let-us imagine, what is much more
probable, that on the rumour of our having taken any measure in favour of Greece, the barbarous and infuriated Janissaries at Smyrna were to assassinate our consul and fellow
citizens residing there; might not a war grow out of such
acts? The gentleman from Massachusetts said, yesterday,
that we had already taken steps, which would offend the
Ottoman Porte as much as the one he proposed. Money
has been freely and publicly contributed in aid of the Greeks

tian Europe. Large sums have been contributed for that

purpose in England, in Germany, and even in Russia. He
said, too, that the executive, in the secretary's letter to the
agent of the Greek government, and subsequently in his
message to congress, has used expressions calculated to
irritate that court as much as if we were to send a commission to Greece. These expressions of ardent wishes for
the success of the Greeks are honourable to the executive,
and will be echoed back by the nation. They may be so
by this house with safety, and that expression of our interest in their welfare and success would have all the cheering
influence the gentleman anticipates from the measure he
proposes.
It appears to me, that in the consideration of this question,
we have been misled by comparing this revolution with
that of Spanish America. And I have heard it argued, that,
as we sent commissioners to Buenos Ayres, without rousing
the jealousy of any nation, and recognised the independence
of those governments without exciting the hostility of Spain,
we may do the same in relation to Greece, without offending any nation in Europe.
Independently of the different attitude it becomes us to
assume toward America, there is no similarity in the two
cases. When we adopted the first measure, Buenos Ayres
had been independent, defacto, for more than eight years,
and Spain had not, during the whole of that period, made
the slightest effort to recover possession of that country.
When we recognised the independence of the American
governments south of us, they were all free, from the Sabine
to the La Plata. The tide could not be rolled back; but,
in whatever light Spain may have regarded our conduct on
those occasions, the situation of the internal concerns of
that country prevented any manifestation of its resentment.
No, sir! It is to Europe that we must look for a case parallel to that of Greece. Let us suppose, that the Italian
states had made an attempt to shake off the iron yolie of
Austria, would there be any doubt as to the course of policy
this country ought to pursue in that case? Or, if Poland
were again to make a desperate effort to recover its liberties, and to re-establish its political existence-that gallant
nation would have a claim to our sympathies.  Yet, I apprehend, we should hesitate before we took any step which
mnight offend the Emperor of Russia.  Is there a country
254on earth in whose fate we feel a deeper interest than in that
of Ireland?  A braver or more generous nation does not
exist. Her exiled patriots have taken refuge here, and are
among our most useful and distinguished citizens. They
are identified with us, and the land which gave them birth
must always inspire us with the warmest interest. But, if
the Irish were to make a general effort to separate themselves from England, we should pause before we adopted
a measure whicht might be interpreted by Great Britain as
an interference of her domestic policy. And yet the Turks
are more regardless of' the laws of nations, more violent in
character, and more reckless of consequences, than any
power in Europe. It has been said, that when we exercise
an undoubted right, we ought not to regard consequences.
This may be magnanimous language to hold, but would
such conduct be prudent in this case? We may despise
the power of Turkey, and Egypt, and Barbary, united, but
can we be certain, that in the event of a war, we should
have only to contend with them? The conduct of Great
Britain and of the allies, in relation to the contest, which
has been so fully dwelt upon, and so ably exposed by the
gentleman from Massachusetts, ought to convince us, that
they would regard any interference, on our part, with great
jealousy. They have repeatedly declared, that they would
discourage any change in the present state of possession
of the great European powers, among which T'urkey holds
a station, whichl niight strengthen one, or lessen the security
of another: and that they would discountenance any act
calculated to call forth a new order of things, the issue of
which it would be impossible to predict. The reasons for
these declarations are obvious. Every power in Europe
balances between its terror of revolutionary principles, and
its dread of the augmenting power of Russia. The independence of Greece alarms their fears in both these respects. The first revolutionary movement in that country
was supported by, if it did not emanate from, an association
in Germany. The succours afforded by the Philhellenic
societies in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, have contributed largely to the success of the patriots. The revolution
of Greece broke out simultaneously with that of Piedmont;
and the agents of the Greek government have, most imprudently, boasted of the effect which the liberties of Greece

255THE AMtRICAN SPEAKER.
would be likely to produce on the neighbouring states. And
there is no doubt that the establishment of free institutions
in Greece would have a powerful influence on the minds
of the enthusiastic Italians and Germans.
- For these reasons, among others even more selfish, Austria has been hostile to this revolution from its commencement. France is opposed to any change in the present state
of possession of the great European powers, which might
grow out of the dismemberment of Turliey. Such an event
could not augment her strength, and might lessen her security. For obvious reasons, that power, in common with
all others on the continent of Europe, is averse to the establishment of any new republic. Great Britain, throughout
this contest, has evinced a desire to preserve the integrity
of the Turkish empire. The Ionian, islands which are
under her dominion, have not only been prohibited from
taking a part in the war, and the inhabitants disarmed, but
the ports of those islands have been made places of deposit
for grain and other supplies for the Turkish fleets. The
only act of Great Britain which can be regarded as at all
favourable to the Greeks, is the acknowledgment of their
blocliades; an act of justice which could not be refused to
the relative position of the two parties. The prevailing
opinion appears to be, that, united by the bond of one common religion, Greece, as the ally, or as the dependant of
Russia, would, by means of her formidable marine, render
irresistible that already colossal power. Great Britain appears to have regarded the dismemberment and partition of
Turkey, as a necessary consequence of rupture between
that power and Russia. To prevent this, all her influence
has been exerted, and no reasonable doubt exists, that, if
negotiation had failed to effect an accommodation between
them, Great Britain would have appeared in arms as the
ally of the Porte.
The course of policy pursued by Russia, on this occasion, has been so fully developed by the gentleman from
Massachusetts, that it is unnecessary for me to dwell upon
it. The sacred obligations of that power to protect the
Greeks, and even its long conceived projects of aggrandizement, appear to have yielded to the dread of encouraging
revolution. In whatever light we may regard a policy
which sacrifices to its selfish views the rights of humanity
256and justice, and the claims of a suffering Christian people,
in matters relating exclusively to Europe we ought not to
interfere. We cannot do so without departing from those
principles of sound policy which have hitherto guided our
councils, and directed our conduct. Any interference on
our part, in favour of a cause which not even remotely
affects our interest, could only be regarded in the light of a
crusade, and might injuire the Greeks by alarming the fears
of the allied powers.'rhey already dread the moral influence of our republican institutions; let us not make it their
interest, and give them a pretext, to attack us, by going
forth to disturb the integrity of their possessions, or the
security of their monarchical governments in Europe. The
distinction drawn by the president in his last message,
marks the true and only safe course of policy for this
country to pursue. [Mr. P. here quoted the message:]
" A strong hope has been entertained, founded on the
heroic struggle of the Greeks, that they would succeed in
their contest, and resume their equal station among the
nations of the earth. It is believed that the whole civilized
world takes a deep interest in their welfare.  Although no
power has declared in their favour, yet none, according to
our information, has taken part against them. Their cause
and their name have protected them from dangers, which
might, ere this, have overwhelmed any other people. The
ordinary calculations of interest and of acquisitions, with
a view to aggrandizement, which mingle so much in the
transactions of nations, seem  to have had no effect in
regard to them. From the facts which have come to our
knowledge, there is good cause to believe that their enemy
has lost for ever all dominion over them; that Greece will
become again an independent nation. That she may obtain
that rank, is the object of our most ardent wishes."
[Mr. P. then referred to the letter of the secretary of
state, comanunicated to congress.]
The letter of the secretary of state to the agent of the
Greek government corroborates this view of our policy,
and, if taken together, clearly shows the views of the executive in relation to our foreign policy.
In this hemisphere we have already taken the station
which it becomes us to hold. We have been the first to
recognise the free states of North and South America, and

24THIIE AMIXERICAN SPEAKER.
the honour and safety of this country require us to defend
tlhem from the attacks of the confederated imonarchs of Europe. We are called upon, by every consideration, to resist
them, should they attempt to extend their plans of conquest
and legitimacy to America; for, if they succeed in that
unhallowed enterprise, the independence of nations will be
but a name.
That there are indications of such intentions, no one will
deny. The King of Spain has proclaimed his determination
to employ force to recover his American dominions. Even
he is not weak enough to undertake an enterprise of such
magnitude with the resources of Spain alone. The envoy
of the Emperor of Russia, sent to congratulate Ferdinand
on his restoration to the fihlness of his legitimate authority,
or, in other words, to the right of tyrannizing over his subjects without control, expresses the wishes of his august
master that the benefits now enjoyed by his subjects in
Europe may be extended to his dominions in America. In
reply to our call for information upon that subject, the
president indirectly tells us, that some combined movement
against America is to be apprehended. Indeed, we may see
the storm gathering in all signs of the times.
And at this portentous crisis, when we may be compelled
to take up arms to defend our rights and liberties on this
side of the Atlantic, shall we extend our operations to the
remotest corner of Europe? When, to preserve our political existence, we ought to concentrate our strength, shall
we diffuse and weaken it by engaging in a distant war?
Shall we, in short, so give way to feelings of mere charity
and generosity, as to lose sight of the higher obligations
of prudence and self-defence?
The gentleman from Massachusetts has painted in true
colours the fearful combination of sovereigns against the
liberties of mankind. But, if there is danger, and I agree
with him that it is imminent and appalling, it is here that
we ought to meet it. A very slight examination of our resources, of the nature and character of our government and
institutions, will convince us, that, in a distant war, foreign
to our interests, this nation is weak as an infant. For pur
poses of defence, in a war that would unite all our resources,
and rouse the energies of the people, we are strong as
Hercules.
258I repeat, that if there is danger to be apprellen(led from
the avowed principles of the holy alliance, it is in America
that we must resist theni. Like the generous animal which
is the emblem of this country, let us not go forth to seek
enemies. If they threaten us, let our warning be heard
over the waves, in the voices of mnillions of freemen, resolved to maintain their liberties. If they approach our
shores with hostile intent, we may arise in the collected
strength of a great nation, and hurl destruction on the foes
of freedom and of Amierica.
I think, sir, that any resolutions we may pass on this
subject ought to be expressive of our policy and of the
position we occupy in relation to Europe, and that which
we are resolved to assume in relation to America; and,
with that view, I propose the following resolution as a substitute for those offered by my friend from Massachusetts:
" Resolved, That this house view with deep interest the
heroic struggle of the Greeks to elevate themselves to the
rank of a free and independent nation; and unite with the
president in the sentiments he has expressed in their favour;
in sympathy for their sufferings, in interest in their welfare,
and in ardent wishes for their success."  POINSETT.
104.---CONCLUSION OF MR. CLAY'S SPEECH ON THE SAME
QUESTION.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-It has been said, that the proposed measure will be a departure from our uniform policy with respect to foreign nations;-that it will provoke the ire of the
holy alliance:-and will, in effect, be a repetition of their
own offence, by an unwarrantable interference with the
domestic concerns of' other powers. No, sir; not even if
it proposed, which it does not, an immediate recognition of
Grecian independence.  What has been the uniforim policy
and practice of this government, from the days of Washington to this moment?  In the case of France, president
Washington, and his successors, received Genet, Fuchet,
and all who followed them, whether sent from king, convention, anarchy, or emperor. Sir, the rule we have followed
has ever been this; to look at the state of the fact, and to recognise that government, be it what it might, which was in
259
POINSETT-CLAY.THE AM1ERICAN SPEAKER.
actual possession of sovereign power  When one of thtse
governments was overthrown, and a new one established on
its ruins, without embarrassing ourselves with any principles involved in the contest, we have ever acknowledged
the new and actual government as soon as it had positive
existence. Our simple inquiry has been, which is the
government defacto?
An example has recently been furnished in relation to the
government of Spain.  When the foreign ministers were
driven or retired from Madrid, and refused to accompany
Ferdinand to Cadiz, our minist6r sought at that port, to
present himself to the constitutional Ferdinand--why?'rhis government held Ferdinand to be the actual king.
Did this produce any declaration of war? Were ally
diplomatic notes ever received complaining of this proceeding?  Nothing like it, sir. The lines are so plainly
marked in which we are to go, that there is ino mistaking
them. We are to engage in no interference with their disputes, no contests for either party, no entangling alliances,
but to maintain our diplomatic intercourse with existing
sovereignties.  It has been admitted by all, that there is
impending over this country a threatening storm, which
is likely to call into action all our vigour, courage, and
resources. Is it a wise way of preparing for this awful
event to talk to this nation of its incompetency to resist
European aggression, to lower its spirit, to weaken its
moral force, and do what we can to prepare it for base submission alld easy conquest? If, sir, there be any reality
in this menacing danger, I would rather adjure the nation
to remember that it contains a nmillion of freemen capable
of bearing arms, and ready to exhaust their last drop of
blood and their last cent, in defending their country, its
institutions, and its liberty. Sir, are these to be conquered
by all Eulrope united? BTut I am quite sure that that danger, so far at least as this resolution is concerned, is perfectly ideal and imaginary. But, if it were otherwise, any
danger is best guarded against by invigorating our minds to
meet it-by teaching our heads to think, our hearts to
conceive, and our arms to execute the high and noble deeds
which belong to the character and glory of our country.
Sir, the experience of the world may instruct us, that
conquests are achieved when they are boldly and firmly
260determined on; and that men become slaves as sooni as
they have ceased to resolve to live freemen. If we wish
to cover'ourselves with the best of all armour against
perils, let us not discourage our people, let us stimulate
their ardour, let us sustain their resolution, let us show
thein that we feel as they feel, anid that we are prepared to
live or die like freemen.  Surely, sir, we need no long or
learned lectures about the influence of property or of rank;
let us rather remen-rber that we can bring into the field a
million of bayonets; let us remember that we are placed
over a nation capable of doing and of suffering all things
for its liberty.
I can never forget what was once sai( to me by a most
illustrious female, the first of the age, if not of her sex,
on this subject.  " Mr. Clay, (said that enlightened lady,)
a nation never yet was conquered." No, sir-no united
nation can be, that has the spirit to resolve not to be conquered; such a nation is ever invincible.  And, sir, has it
come to this?  Are we so humbled, so low, so despicable,
that we dare not express our sympathy for suffering
Greece, lest peradventure we might offend some one or
more of their imperial and royal majesties? If gentlemen
are afraid to act rashly on such a subject, suppose, Mr.
Chairman, that we draw an humble petition addressed to
their majesties, asking them that of their condescension
they would allow us to express something on the subject.
How, sir, shall it begin?."We, the representatives of
the free people of the United States of America, humbly
approach the thrones of your imperial and royal majesties,
and supplicate that of your imperial and royal clemency"
-I will not go through the disgusting recital; my lips
have not yet learnt the sycophantic language of a degraded
slave. Are we so low, so base, so despicable, that we
may not express our horror, articulate our detestation, of
the most brutal and atrocious war that ever stained earth,
or shocked high heaven, with the ferocious deeds of a brutal
soldiery, set on by the clergy and followers of a fanatical
and inimical religion, and rioting in excesses of blood and
butchery, at the mere details of which the breast sickens?
If the great mass of Christendom can look coolly andl
calmly on, while all this is perpetrated on a Christiai
people in their own -vicinity, in their very presence, let us,
CLAY.:261THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
at least show, thlat, in this distant extremity, there is still
some sensibility and sympathy for Christian wrongs and
sufferings, that there are still feelings which can kindle into
indignation, at the oppression of a people endeared to us
by every ancient recollection and every modern tie.
Sir, the house has been attempted to be alarmed by the
dangers to our commerce, and a miserable invoice of figs
and opium have been presented to us to repress our sensibilities, and to eradicate our humanity. Ah, sir, " what
shall it profit a man if he gaini the whole world, and lose
his own soul?" or what shall it profit a nation to save the
whole of a wretched comnrmerce, and lose its liberties?
As to the question of American interests, hitherto, it has
not been necessary to depart from the rule of our foreign
relations laid down in regard to Europe.  Whether it shall
become us to do so or not, will be discussed when we take
up another resolution thlat lies upon your table. But we
may not only pass this resolution; we may go further; we
may recognise the government in the Morea, and yet it
will not be any cause of war, nor will it be war, nor even
aid. Besides, sir, what is Greece to the allies? A part
of their own dominions?   By no means. Suppose the
people in one of the Philippine Isles, or in any other spot
still more insulated and remote, in Asia or Africa, were to
resist their former rulers, and set up and establish a new
government; are we not to recognise them for fear of the
holy alliance? If they are going to interfere on the principle of example, here is the spot where they must strike.
This government, you, Mr. Chairman, and the body over
which you preside, are the living reproach to allied
despotism. If they attack us at all, they will do it here.
They will assail us in our own happy land. They will
attack us because you, sir, sit beneath that canopy, and we
sit freely debating upon the great interests of freemen.
They will strike because we pass one of those bills on
your table. The passing of the least of them by our
authority is as galling to despotic powers as will be the
passage of this so-much-dreaded resolution.
Pass the resolution, and what, sir, do you do?  You
exercise an act of indisputable sovereignty, for which you
are responsible to none of them. You do the same act as
when you pass a bill-no more. If the allies object, let
262CLAY.                      263
them  forbid us to take a vote in this house-let them
disperse us--let them strip us of every attribute of sovereignty.
Do gentlemen attempt to maintain that, on the principles
of the laws of nations, these powers have cause of war?
Sir, if there is any principle settled for ages, any which is
founded in the very nature of things, it is, that every sovereign power has a right to judge as to the fact of the existence of other sovereign powers. I admit there may be a
state of inchoate, inactive sovereignty, in which a new
government is struggling into being, and may not be said
yet perfectly to exist; but the premature recognition of such
a new government can give offence justly to no other than
its ancient sovereign.  The right to recognise comprehends
the right to be informed; and the means of information
must depend upon the sound discretion of the party seeking it. You may send out a commission of inquiry, and
charge it with a provident attention to your own interests
and your own people. If you adopt it, no act necessarily
follows. You merely grant the means by which the
executive may act when he thinks proper. What does he
tell you in his message? that Greece is struggling for freedom--that all sympathize with her, and that no power has
declared against her. You pass this resolution, and what
does it say to the president? " You have sent us grateful
intelligence: we feel for Greece, and we grant you money,
that, when you thinli it proper, when the interests of this
nation shall not be jeopardized, you may depute a commissioner, a public functionary, to Greece."  This is all it
says; and the whole responsibility is left with the executive, where the constitution puts it. But, sir, it is not first
and chiefly for Greece, that I wish to see this measure
adopted. It will give them but little aid, that aid purely
of a moral kind.
It is, indeed, soothing and solacing in distress, to hear
the accents of a friendly voice, (we know this as a people.)
But, sir, it is principally and mainly for America herself,
for the credit and character of our common country, that
I hope to see this resolution pass: it is for our own unsullied name that I feel.  What appearance on the page of
history would a recor(l like this make, Mr. Chairman,' In tile month of January, in the year of our ILord an(LTHE AIERICAN SPEAKER.
Saviour, 1824, while all European Christendom  beheld,
with cold unfeeling apathy, the unexampled wrongs and
inexpressible misery of the Christians in Greece, a proposition was made in the Congress of the United States,
almost the sole, the last, the greatest repository of human
hope and of human freedom, the representatives of a nation
capable of bringing into the field a million of bayonets,
while the freemen of that nation were spontaneously expressing its deep-toned feeling, its fervent prayer for Grecian success, while the whole continent was raising, by one
simultaneous emotion, solemnly and anxiously supplicating
and invoking the aid of Heaven to spare Greece and to
invigorate her arms, while temples and senate houses were
all resounding with one burst of generous feeling--(gentlemen may call it enthusiastic declamation if they please;
would to God we could hear such declamation and the
utterance of such feeling from them)-in the year of our
Lord and Saviour, that Saviour alike of Christian Greece
and of us-a proposition was offered in the American Congress, to send a messenger to Greece, to inquire into her
state and condition, with an expression of our good wishes
and our sympathies-and it was rejected."  Go home, if
you dare; go home, if you can, to your constituents, and tell
them that you voted it down--meet, if you dare, the appalling countenances of those who sent you here, (I mean no
defiance,) and tell them that you shrank from the declaration of your own sentiments--that you cannot tell how,
but that some unknown dread, some indescribable apprehension, some indefinable danger, affrighted you--that the
spectres of cimeters, and crowns, and crescents, gleamed
before you, and alarmed you; and that you suppressed all
the noble feelings prompted by religion, by liberty, by
national independence, and by humanity. I cannot bring
myself to believe, that such will be the feeling of a majority
of this house. But, for myself, though every friend of the
measure should desert it, and I left to stand alone, with the
gentleman from Massachusetts, I will give to the resolution
the poor sanction of my unqualified approbation.
264RANDOLPH.
105.-EXTRAC'1' FROM A SPEECH OF JOHN RANDOLPH ON THE
SAME QUESTION.
MR. CHAIRMAN,-It is with serious concern and alarm,
that I have heard doctrines broached in this debate, fraught
with consequences more disastrous to the best interests of
this people than any that I have ever heard advanced during
the five-and-twenty years that I have been honoured with a
seat on this floor. They imply, to my apprehension, a
total and fundamental change of the policy pursued by this
government, ab urbe condita--from the foundation of the
republic, to the present day. Are we, sir, to go on a crusade, in another hemisphere, for the propagation of two
objects--objects as dear and delightful to my heart as to
that of any gentleman in this, or in any other assembly--
liberty and religion--and, in the name of these holy words
--by this powerful spell, is this nation to be conjured and
persuaded out of the high way of heaven--out of its present comparatively happy state, into all the disastrous conflicts arising from the policy of European powers, with all
the consequences which flow from them?
Liberty and religion, sir! I believe that nothing similar
to this proposition is to be found in modern history, unless
in the famous decree of the French national assembly,
which brought combined Europe against them, with its
united strength, and, after repeated struggles, finally effected
the downfall of the French power. Sir, I am wrong--
there is another example of like doctrine; and you find it
among that strange and peculiar people--in that mysterious
book, which is of the highest authority with them, (for it
is at once their gospel and their law,) the Koran, which
enjoins it to be the duty of all good Moslems to propagate
its doctrines at the point of the sword--by the edge of the
cimeter. The character of that people is a peculiar one:
they differ from every other race. It has been said, here,
that it is four hundred years since they encamped in
Europe. Sir, they were encamped, on the spot where we
now find them, before this country was discovered, and
their title to the country which they occupy is at least as
good as ours. They hold their possessions there by the
same title by which all other countries are held-possession, obtained at first by a successful employment of force,
23
265confirmed by time, usage, prescription-the best of all possible titles. Their policy has been not tortuous, like that of
other states of Europe, but straightforward: they had invariably appealed to the sword, and they held by the sword,
The Russ had, indeed, made great encroachments on their
empire, but the ground had been contested inch by inch';
and the acquisitions of Russia on the side of Christian
Europe--Livonia, Ingria, Courland--Finland, to the gulf
of Bothnia-Poland!-had been greater than that of the
Mahometans. And, in consequence of this straightforward policy to which I before referred, this peculiar people
could boast of being the only one of the continental
Europe, whose capital had never been insulted by the presence of a foreign military force. It was a curious fact,
well worthy of attention, that Constantinople was the only
capital in continental Europe--for Moscow was the true
capital of Russia--that had never been in possession of an
enemy. It is, indeed, true, that the Empress Catharine did
inscribe over the gate of one of the cities that she had won
in the Krimea, (Cherson, I think,) " the road to Byzantium;" but, sir, it has proved-perhaps too low a word for
the subject-but a stumpy road for Russia. Who, at that
day, would have been believed, had he foretold to that
august (for so she was) and illustrious woman that her
Cossacks of the Ukraine, and of the Don, would have
encamped in Paris before thev reached Constantinople?
Who would have been believed, if he had foretod that a
French invading force--such as the world never saw
before, and, I trust, will never again see-would lay Moscow itself in ashes? These are considerations worthy of
attention, before we embark in tile project proposed by
this resolution, the consequences of which no human eye
can divine.
I would respectfully ask the gentleman from Massachusetts, whether in his very able and masterly argumentand he has said all that could be said upon the subject, and
more than I supposed could be said by any man in favoul
of his resolution-whether he himself lhas not furnished
an answer to his speech-I had not the happiness myself
to hear his speech, but a friend has read it to me. In one
of the arguments in that speech, toward the conclusion, I
think, of his speech, the gentleman lays down, from
266
THE AMER'ICAN SPEAKEER.Puffendorf, in reference to the honeyed words and pious
professions of the holy alliance, that these are all surplusage, because nations are always supposed to be read(y to
do what justice and national law require. Well, sir, if this
be so, why may not the Greeks presume-why are they
not, on this principle, bound to presume, that this government is disposed to do all, in reference to them, that they
ought to do, without any formal resolutions to that effect?
I ask the gentleman from Massachusetts, whether the doctrine of Puffendorf does not apply as strongly to the resolution as to the declaration of the allies-that is, if the resolution of the gentleman be indeed that almost nothing he
would have us suppose, if there be not something behind
this nothing which divides this house (not horizontally, as
the gentleman has ludicrously said-but vertically) into
two unequal parties, one the advocate of a splendid system
of crusades, the other the friends of peace and harmony;
the advocates of a fireside policy-for, as had been truly
said, as long as all is right at the fireside, there cannot be
much wrong elsewhere-whether, I repeat, does not the
doctrine of Puffendorf apply as well to the words of the
resolution as to the words of the holy alliance?
But, sit we have already done more than this. The
president of the United States, the only organ of communication which the people have seen fit to establish between
us and foreign powers, has already expressed all, in reference to Greece, that the resolution goes to express actum
est--it is done-it is finished-there is an end. Not, that
I would have the house to infer, that I mean to express any
opinion as to the policy of such a declaration-the practice of responding to presidential addresses and mnessages
had gone out for, now, these two or three-and-twenty
years.
106.-SECOND EXTRACT FROM THE SAME SPEECH.
MR. CHAIRMAN,--Permit me, sir, to ask why, in the
selection of an enemy to the doctrines of our government,
and a party to those advanced by the holy alliance, we
should fix on Turkey?  She, at least, forms no part of
that alliance; and I venture to say, that, for the last centtry,

one, we most admire the man; in the other, the work. Homer hurries
us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil leads us with an attractive

with a careful magnificence. Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches
with a sudden overflow; Virgil, like a river in its banks, with a constant stream. And when we look upon their machines, Homer seems,
like his own Jupiter in his terror, shaking Olympus, scattering the

EXAMPLES.
1. Who continually supports and governs this stupendous system'?     Who   preserves ten    thousand times ten
thousand worlds in perpetual harmony'? Who enables
them  always to observe such times, and obey such laws,
as are most exquisitely adapted for the perfection of the
wondrous whole'?     They cannot preserve and direct themselves; for they were created, and must, therefore, be dependent.   How, then, can they be so actuated and directed
but by the unceasing energy of the great Supreme'?
2. Ah! why will kings forget that they are men,
And men that they are brethren'? Why delight
In human' sacrifice?   Why burst the ties
Of nature, that should knit their souls together
In one soft bond of amity and love'?

her conduct, in reference to her neighbours, has been much
more Christian than that of all the "most Christian,"
"m nost Catholic," or "most faithful" majesties of Europe
-for she has not interfered, as we propose to do, in the
internal affairs of other nations.
But, sir, we have not done. Not satisfied with attempting to support the Greeks, our world, like that of Pyrrhus
or Alexarder, is not sufficient for us. We have yet another
world for exploits: we are to operate in a country distant
from us eighty degrees of latitude, and only accessible by
a circumnavigation of the globe, and to subdue which, we
must cover the Pacific with our ships, and the tops of the
Andes with onr soldiers. Do gentlemen seriously reflect
on the work they have cut out for us? Why, sir, these
projects of ambition surpass those of Bonaparte himself.
It has once been said of the dominions of the King of
Spain-thank God! it can no longer be said-that the sun
never set upon them. Sir, the sun never sets on ambition
like this: they who have once felt its scorpion sting, are
never satisfied with a limit less than the circle of our planet.
I have heard, sir, the late coruscation in the heavens
attempted to be accounted for by the return of the lunar
cycle, the moon having got back into the sani relative
position in which she was nineteen years ago. However
this may be, I am afraid, sir, that she exerts too potent an
influence over our legislation, or will have done so, if we
agree to adopt the resolution on your table. I think about
once in seven or eight years, for that seems to be the term
of our political cycle, we may calculate upon beholding
some redoubted champion, like him who prances into Westminster Hall, armed cap-a-pie, like Sir Somebody Dimock,
at the coronation of the British king, challenging all who
dispute the title of the sovereign to the crown-coming into
this house, mounted on some magnificent project, such as
this. But, sir, I never expected, that, of all places in the
world, (except Salem,) a proposition like this should have
come from Boston!
Sir, I am afraid, that, along with some most excellent
attributes and qualities-the love of liberty, jury trial, the
writ of habeas corpus, and all the blessings of free governinent, that we have derived from our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, we have got not a little of their John Bull, or rather
268bull-dog spirit-their readiness to fight for anybody, and
on any occasion. Sir, England has been for centuries the
game-cgck of Europe. It is impossible to specify the
wars in which she has been engaged for contrary purposes;
-and she will, with great pleasure, see us take off her
shoulders the labour of preservirg the balance of power.
We find her fighting, now, for the Queen of Hungary-then,
for her inveterate foe, tthe King of Prussia--now at war for
the restoration of the Bourbons-and now on the eve of war
with them, for the liberties of Spain. These lines on the
subject were never more applicable than they have now
become" Now Europe's balanced--neither side prevailsFor nothing's left in either of the scales."
If we pursue the same policy, we must travel the same
road, and endure the same burdens, under which England
now groans. But, glorious as such a design might be,
a president of the United States would, in his apprehension,
occupy a prouder place in history, who, when he retires
from office, can say to the people who elected him, I leave
you without a debt, than if he had fought as many pitched
battles as Caesar, or achieved as many naval victories as
Nelson. And what is debt? In an individutal, it is slavery.
It is slavery of the worst sort, surpassing that of the West
India islands, for it enslaves the mind as well as it enslaves
the body; and the creature who can be abject enough to
incur and to submit to it, receives in the condition of his being
an adequate punishment. Of course, I speak of debt, with
the exception of unavoidable misfortune. I speak of debt
caused by mismanagement, by unwarrantable generosity,
by being generous before being just. I know that this
sentiment was ridiculed by Sheridan, whose lamentable end
was the best commentary upon its truth. No, sir: let us
abandon these projects. Let us say to those seven millions
of Greeks, "1We defended ourselves, when we were but
three millions, against a power, in comparison to which the
Turk is but as a lamb. Go, and do thou likewise." And so
with respect to the governments of South America. If,
after having achieved their independence, they have not
valour to maintain it, I would not commit the safety and
independence of this country in such a cause. I will, in

107.-AN INDIAN AT THE BITRYING-PLACE OF HIS FATHERS
IT is the spot I came to seek,--
My fathers' ancient burial-place,
Ere from these vales, ashamed and weak,
Withdrew our wasted race.
It is the spot-I know it well--
Of which our old traditions tell.
For here the upland bank sends out
A ridge toward the river side;
I know the shaggy hills about,
The meadows smooth and wide;
The plains that, toward the southern sky,
Fenced east and west by mountains lie.
The shQep are on the slopes around,
The cattle in the meadows feed,
And labourers turn the crumbling "ground
Or drop the yellow seed,
And prancing steeds, in trappings gay,
Whirl the bright chariot on its way.
Methinks it were a nobler sight
To see these vales in woods array'd,
Their summits in the golden light,
Their trunks in grateful shade,
And herds of deer, that bounding go
O'er rills and prostrate trees below.
And then to mark the lord of all,
The forest hero, train'd to wars,
Quiver'd, and plumed, and lithe and tall,
And seam'd with glorious scars,
Walk forth, amid his reign, to dare
The wolf, and grapple with the bear.
270BRYANT.
This bank, in which the dead were laid,
Was sacred when its soil was ours;
Hither the artless Indian maid
Brought wreaths of beads and flowers,
And the gray chief and gifted seer
Worshipp'd the God of thunders here.
But now the wheat is green and high
On clods that hid the warrior's breast,
And scatter'd in the furrows, lie
The weapons of his rest;
And there, in the loose sand, is thrown
Of his large arm the mouldering bone.
Ah little thought the strong and brave,
Who bore their lifeless chieftain forth;
Or the young wife, that weeping gave
Her first-born to the earth,
That the pale race, who waste us now,
Among. their bones should guide the plough
They waste us--ay-like April snow
In the warm noon, we shrink away;
And fast they follow, as we go
Towards the setting day,Till they shall fill the land, and we
Are driven into the western sea.
But I behold a fearful sign,
To which the white men's eyes are blind;
Their race may vanish hence, like mine,
And leave no trace behind,
Save ruins o'er the region spread,
And the white stones above the dead.
Before these fields were shorn and till'd,
Full to the brim our rivers flow'd;
The melody of waters fill'd
The fresh and boundless wood;
And torrents dash'd, and rivulets play'd,
And fountains spouted in the shade.
Those grateful sounds are heard no more,
The springs are silent in the sun,

WHAT hidest thou in thy treasure-caves and cells?
Thou hollow-sounding and mysterious main!
Pale glistening pearls, and rainbow-colour'd shells,
Bright things which gleam unreck'd of and in vain.
Keep, keep thy riches, melancholy sea!
We ask not such from thee.
Yet more, the depths have more!--What wealth untold,
Far down, and shining through their stillness, lies!
Thou hast the starry gems, the burning gold,
Won from ten thousand royal argosies.
Sweep o'er thy spoils, thou wild and wrathful main!
Earth claims not these again!
Yet more, the depths have more! Thy waves have roll'd
Above the cities of a world gone by!
Sand hath fill'd up the palaces of old,
Sea-weed o'ergrown the halls of revelry!
Dash o'er them, ocean! in thy scornful play,
Man yields them to decay!
Yet more! the billows and the depths have more!
High hearts and brave are gather'd to thy breast!
They hear not now the booming waters roar,The battle-thunders will not break their rest.
Keep thy red gold and gems, thou stormy grave!
Give back the true and brave!
Give back the lost and lovely!-Those for whom
The place was kept at board and hearth so long;
-The prayer went up through midnight's breathless gloom
And the vain yearning woke midst festal song!
Hold fast thy buried isles, thy towers o'erthrown,
--But all is not thine own!

109.----THE CLOSE OF AUTU1MN.
THE melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,
Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown
and sere.
Heap'd in the hollows of the grove, the wither'd leaves lie
dead,
They rustle to the eddying gust and to the rabbit's tread,
The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrubs the
jay,
And from the wood top calls the crow, through all the
gloomy day.
Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately
sprung and stood
In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood!
Alas! they all are in their graves-the gentle race of
flowers
Are lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and good of
ours:
The rain is falling where they lie-but the cold November
rain
Calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again.
The wind-flower and the violet, they perish'd long ago,
And the brier-rose, and the orchis died, amid the summer's
glow;
But on the hill the golden rod, and the aster in the wood,
And the yellow sunflower by the brook in autumn beauty
stood,
Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the
plague on men,
And the brightness of their smile was gone from upland,
glade, and glen.
And now when comes the calm mild day-as still such
days will come,
To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter
home;
When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the
trees are still,
And twinkle in the hazy light the waters of the rill,
273THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
The south wind searclhes for the flowers whose fragrance
late he bore,
And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no
more.
And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,
The fair meek blossom that grew tip and faded by my side.
In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast
the leaf,
And we wept that one so lovely should have a lot so brief;
Yet not unmeet it was, that one, like that young friend of
ours,
So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers,
BRYANT.
1 10.--THE CORAL GROVE.
DEEP in the wave is a coral grove,
Where the purple mullet and gold-fish rove,
Where the sea-flower spreads its leaves of blue,
That never are wet with falling dew,
But in bright and changeful beauty shine
Far down in the green and grassy brine.
The floor is of sand like the mountain drift,
And the pearl shells spangle the flinty snow:
From coral rocks the sea-plants lift
Their bows where the tides and billows flow;
The water is calm and still below,
For the winds and waves are absent there,
And the sands are bright as the stars that glow
In the motionless fields of upper air;
There with its waving blade of green,
The sea-flag streams through the silent water,
And the crimson leaf of the dulse is seen
To blush like a banner bathed in slaughter;
There with a light and easy motion,
The fan-coral sweeps through the clear deep sea;
And the yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean
Are bending like corn on the upland lea;
And life, in rare and beautiful forms,
Is sporting amid those bowers of stone,
274And is safe when the wrathful spirit of storms
Has made the top of the wave his own:
And when the ship from his fury flies,
Where the myriad voices of ocean roar,
When the wind-god frowns in the murky skies,
And demons are waiting the wreck on shore:
Then far below, in the peaceful sea,
The purple mullet and gold-fish rove,
Where the waters murmur tranquilly
Through the bending twigs of the coral grove.

114.---EXTRACT FROM MR. WEBSTER'S SPEECH, AT THE DINNER IN HONOUR OF THE MEMORY OF WASHINGTON, IN THE
CITY OF WVASHINGTON, FEBRUARY 22, 1832.
I RISE, gentlemen, to propose to you the name of that
great man, in commemoration of whose birth, and in
honour of whose character and services, we have here
assembled.
I am sure that I express a sentiment common to every
one present when I say, that there is something more than
ordinarily solemn and affecting on this occasion.
We are met to testify our regard for him, whose name
is intimately blended with whatever belongs most essentially to the prosperity, the liberty, the free institutions,
and the renown of our country. That name was of power
to rally a nation, in the hour of thick-thronging public
disasters and calamities; that name shone, amid the storm
of war, a beacon light, to cheer and guide the country's
friends; its flame, too, like a meteor, to repel her foes.
That name, in the days of peace, was a loadstone, attract
278ing to itself a whole people's confidence, a wliole people's
love, and the whole world's respect; that name, descending
with all time, spread over the whole earth, and uttered in
all the languages belonging to the tribes and races of men,
will for ever be pronounced with affectionate gratitude by
every one in whose breast there shall arise an aspiration
for human rights and human liberty.
We perform this grateful duty, gentlemen, at the expiration of a hundred years from his birth, near the place so
cherished and beloved by him, where his dust now reposes,
and in the capital which bears his own immortal name.
All experience evinces, that human sentiments are
strongly affected by associations.  The recurrence of
anniversaries, or of longer periods of time, naturally freshens the recollection, and deepens the impression of events
with which they are historically connected. Renowned
places, also, have a power to awaken feeling, which all
acknowledge. No American can pass by the fields of
Bunker Hill, Monmouth, or Camden, as if they were ordinary spots on the earth's surface. Whoever visits them
feels the sentiment of love of country kindling anew, as
if the spirit that belonged to the transactions which have
rendered these places distinguished still hovered round
with power to move and excite all who in future time may
approach them.
But neither of these sources of emotion equals the
power with which great moral examples affect the mind.
When sublime virtues cease to be abstractions, when they
become imbodied in human character, and exemplified in
human conduct, we should be false to our own nature, if
we did not indulge in the spontaneous effusions of our gratitude and our admiration. A true lover of the virtue of
patriotism delights to contemplate its purest models; and
that love of country may be well suspected which affects
to soar so high into the regions of sentiment as to be lost
and absorbed in the abstract feeling, and becomes too elevated, or too refined, to glow either with power in the commendation or the love of individual benefactors. All this
is immaterial. It is as if one should be so enthusiastic a
lover of poetry as to care nothing for Homer or Milton; so
passionately attached to eloquence as to be indifferent to
Tully and Chatham; or such a devotee to the arts, in such
WEBSTER.
279THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
an ecstasy with the elements of beauty, proportion, and
expression, as to regard the master pieces of Raphael and
Michael Angelo with coldness or contempt. We may be
assured, gentlemen, that he who really loves the thing
itself, loves its finest exhibitions. A true friend of his
country loves her friends and benefactors, and thinks it no
degradation to commend and commemorate them. The
voluntary out-pouring of public feeling made to-day, from
the north to the south, and from the east to the west,
proves this sentiment to be both just and natural. In the
cities and in the villages, in the public temples and in the
family circles, among all ages and sexes, gladdened voices,
to-day, bespeak grateful hearts, and a freshened recollection of the virtues of the father of his country. And it
will be so, in all time to come, so long as public virtue is
itself an object of regard. The ingenuous youth of America will hold up to themselves the bright model of Washington's example, and study to be what they behold; they
will contemplate his character till all its virtues spread out
and display themselves to their delighted vision, as the
earliest astronomers, the shepherds on the plains of Babylon, gazed at the stars till they saw them form into clusters
and constellations, overpowering at length the eyes of the
beholders, with the united blaze of a thousand lights.
Gentlemen, we are at the point of a century from the
birth of Washington; and what a century it has been  
During its course the human mind has seemed to proceed
with a sort of geometric velocity, accomplishing more than
had been done in fives or tens of centuries preceding.
Washington stands at the commencement of a new era, as
well as at the head of the new world. A century from the
birth of Washington has changed the world. The country
of Washington has been the theatre on which a great part
of that change has been wrought; and Washington himself
a principal agent by which it has been accomplished. His
age and his country are equally full of wonders, and of
both he is the chief.
If the prediction of the poet, uttered a few years before
his birth, be true; if indeed it be designed by Providence
that the proudest exhibition of human character and human
affairs shall be made on this theatre of the western world;'f be true that
280"The first four acts already past,
A fifth shall close the drama with the day;
Time's noblest offspring is the last;"
how could this imposing, swelling, final scene be appropriately opened; how could its intense interest be adequately sustained, but by the introduction of just such a
character as our Washington?
Washington had attained his manhood when that spark
of liberty was struck out in his own country, wllich has
since kindled into a flame, and shot its beams over the
earth. In the flow of a century from his birth, the world
has changed in science, in arts, in the extent of commerce,
in the improvement of navigation, and in all that relates to
the civilization of man. But it is the spirit of human
freedom, the new elevation of individual man, in his moral,
social, and political character, leading the whole long train
of other improvements, which has most remarkably distinguished the era. Society, in this century, has not made its
progress, like Chinese skill, by a greater acuteness of ingenuity in trifles; it has not merely lashed itself to an
increased speed round the old circles of thought and action,
but it has assumed a new character, it has raised itself
from beneath governments, to a participation in governments; it has mixed moral and political objects with the
daily pursuits of individual men, and, with a freedom and
strength before altogether unknown, it has applied to these
objects the whole power of the human understanding. It
has been the era, in short, when the social principle has
triumphed over the feudal principle; when society has
maintained its rights against military power, and established,
on foundations never hereafter to be shaken, its competency
to govern itself.                            WEBSTER.
115.--EXTRACT FROM MR. HAYNE'S SPEECH ON THE TARIFF
BILL, IN CONGRESS, JANUARY, 1832.
MR. PRESIDENT, - The plain and seemingly obvious
truth, that in a fair and equal exchange of commodities all
parties gained, is a noble discovery of modern times. The
contrary principle naturally led to commercial rivalries,
wars, and abuses of all sorts. The benefits of commerce

WEBSTERIIAYNE.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
being regarded as a stake to be won, or an advantage to be
wrested from  others by fraud or by force, governments
naturally strove to secure them to their own subjects; ano
when they once set out in this wrong direction, it was quite
natural- that they should not stop short till they ended ir
binding, in the bonds of restriction, not only the whol
country, but all of its parts. Thus we are told that -Eng
land first protected by her restrictive policy, her whole
empire against all the world, then Great Britain against the
colonies, then the British islands against each other, and
ended by vainly attempting to protect all the great interests
and employment of the state by balancing them against each
other. Sir, such a system, carried fuilly out, is not confinec
to rival nations, but protects one town against another,
considers villages, and even families as rivals; and cannot
stop short of " Robinson Crusoe in his goat skins." It
takes but one step further to make every man his own
lawyer, doctor, farmer, and shoemaker-and, if I may be
allowed an Irishism, his own seamstress and washerwoman.
The doctrine of free trade, on the contrary, is founded on
the true social system. It looks on all mankind as children
of a common parent-and the great family of nations as
linked together by mutual interests. Sir, as there is a
religion, so I believe there is a politics of nature.  Cast
your eyes over this various earth-see its surface diversified with hills and valleys, rocks, and fertile fields. Notice
its different productions-its infinite varieties of soil and
climate. See the mighty rivers winding their way to the
very mountain's base, and thence guiding man to the vast
ocean, dividing, yet connecting nations. Can any man
who considers these things with the eye of a philosopher,
not read the design of the great Creator (written legibly in
his works) that his children should be drawn together in
a free commercial intercourse, and mutual exchanges of the
various gifts with which a bountiful Providence has blessed
them. Commerce, sir, restricted even as she has been, has
been the great source of civilization and refinement all over
the world. Next to the Christian religion, I consider free
trade in its largest sense as the greatest blessing that can be
conferred upon any people. Hear, sir, what Patrick Henry,
the, great orator of Virginia, whose soul was the very temple of freedom, says on this subject:28'2"Why should we fetter commerce?      If a man is in
chains, he droops and bows to the earth, because his spirits
are broken, but let him twist the fettersfrom his legs, and
he will stand erect. Fetter not commerce! Let her be as
free as the air.  She will range the whole creation, and
return on the four winds of heaven to bless the land with
p)lenty."
But, it has been said, that free trade would do very well,
if all nations would adopt it; but as it is, every nation
must protect itself from the effect of restrictions by countervailing measures.  I am persuaded, sir, that it is a great,
a most fatal error. If retaliation is resorted to for the
honest purpose of producing a redress of the grievance,
and while adhered to no longer than there is a hope of success, it may, like war itself, be sometimes just and necessary.  But if it have no such object, " it is the unprofitable
combat of seeing which can do the other the most harm."
The case can hardly be conceived in which permanent
restrictions, as a measure of retaliation, could be profitable.
In every possible situation, a trade, whether more or less
restricted, is profitable, or it is not.  This can only be
decided by experience, and if the trade be left to regulate
itself, water would not more naturally seek its level, than
tlhe intercourse adjust itself to the true interest of the parties.  Sir, as to this idea of the regulation by government
of the pursuits of men, I consider it as a remnant of barbarism disgraceful to an enlightened age, and inconsistent
with the first principles of rational liberty. I hold government to be utterly incapable, from its position, of exercising
such a power wisely, prudently, or justly. Are the rulers
of the world the depositaries of its collected wisdom?
Sir, can we forget the advice of a great statesman to his
son-" Go, see the world, my son, that you may learn
with how little wisdom mankind is governed." And is our
own government an exception to this rule, or do we not
find here, as every where else, that
"Man, proud man,
Robed in a little brief authority,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,
As make the angels weep."
The gentleman has appealed to the example of othei
nations. Sir, they are all against him. They have had
283
-IAYNPE.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
estrictions enough, to be sure; but they are gettiAg
heartily sick of them, and in England, particularly, would
willingly get rid of them if they could. We have been
assured, by the declaration of a minister of the crown, from
his place in parliament, " that there is a growing conviction,
among all men of sense and reflection in that country, that
the true policy of all nations is to be found in unrestricted
industry." Sir, in England they are now retracing their
steps, and endeavouring to relieve themselves of the system
as fast as they can. Within a few years past, upwards of
three hundred statutes, imposing restrictions in that country,
have been repealed; and a case has recently occurred there,
which seems to leave no doubt that, if Great Britain has
grown great, it is, as Mr. Huskisson has declared, " not in
consequence of, but in spite of their restrictions."  The
silk manufacture, protected by enormous bounties, was
found to be in such a declining condition, that the government was obliged to do something to save it from total ruin.
And what did they do?   They considerably reduced the
duty on foreign silks, both on the raw material and the
manufactured article. The consequence was the immediate
revival of the silk manufacture, which has since been nearly
doubled.
Sir, the experience of France is equally decisive. Bonaparte's effort to introduce cotton and sugar has cost that
country millions; and, but the other day, a foolish attempt
to protect the iron mines spread devastation through half
of France, and nearly ruined the wine trade, on which onefifth of her citizens depend for subsistence. As to Spain,
unhappy Spain, "fenced round with restrictions," her experience, one would suppose, would convince us, if any
thing could, that the protecting system in politics, like
bigotry in religion, was utterly at war with sound principles
and a liberal and enlightened policy. Sir, I say, in the
words of the philosophical statesman of England, "leave
a generous nation free to seek their own road to perfection."
Thank God, the night is passing away, and we have lived
to see the dawn of a glorious day. The cause of free trade
must and will prosper, and finally triumph. The political
economist is abroad; light has come into the world; and,
in this instance at least, men will not "prefer darkness
rather than light."  Sir, let it not be said, in after times,
284that the statesmen of America were behind the age in which
they lived-that they initiated this young and vigorous
country into the enervating and corrupting practices of European nations-and that, at the moment when the whole
world were looking to us for an example, we arrayed ourselves in the cast-off follies aud exploded errors of the old
world, and, by the introduction of a vile system of artificial
stimulants and political gambling, impaired the healthful
vigour of the body politic, and brought on a decrepitude
and premature dissolution.                   HAYNE.
116.-THE MOUNTAIN CHURCHI.
As one without a friend, one summer eve
I walk'd among the solemn woods alone.
The boughs hung lovely, and the gentle winds,
Whisper'd a song monotonous and low,
That soothed my mind even while it made me sad.
The path I follow'd, by a turn abrupt,
Brought me to stand beside that humble roof,
Where the few scatter'd fanlilies that dwell
Among these mountains and deep forest shades
Meet weekly, to uplift the soul in prayer.
A few rude logs up-piled were all the walls,Four windows and a door, not e'en adorn'd
With rudest art, were there; and in the midst
A pulpit,-cushion'd not, nor overhung
With crimson folds of fringed drapery,
Nor graced with gilded volumes richly bound.
Amid the mountain pines the low roof stood,
And mountain hands had reared it; but it wore
An air of reverence.
Few paces onward,
O'ershadow'd more by the green underwood,
Some slight raised mounds show'd where the dead were
laid.
No gravestone told who slept beneath the turf.
(Perchance the heart that deeply mourns needs not
Such poor remembrancer.) The forest flowers
Themselves had fondly cluster'd there,--and white
Azarias with sweet breath stood round about

HAYNE.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Like fair young maidens mourning o'er their dead.
In some sweet solitude like this I would
That I might sleep my last long dreamless sleep!
0 quiet resting place! Divine repose!
Let not my voice, I whisper'd, 0 let not
My heedless step profane thy sanctity!
Still shall sweet summer smiling, linger here,
And wasteful winter lightly o'er thee pass;
Bright dews of morning jewel thee! and all
The silent stars watch over thee at night;
The mountains clasp thee lovingly within
Their giant arms, and ever roiund thee bow
The everlasting forest; for -thou art
In thy simplicity a holy spot,
And not unmeet for heavenly worshipper.

1 17.---TIHE MOTHER AND HER INFANTS.
A MOTHER was kneeling in the deep hush of evening, at
the couch of two infants, whose rosy arms were twined in
a mutual embrace. A slumber, soft as the moonlight that
fell through the lattice over them like a silvery veil, lay on
their delicate lips-the soft bright curls that clustered on
their pillow, were slightly stirred by their gentle and
healthful breathings; and that smile, which beams from the
pure depths of the fresh, glad spirit, yet rested on their
coral lips.  The mother looked upon their exceeding
beauty with a momentary pride-and then, as she continued
to gaze upon the lovely slumberers, her dark eye deepened
with an intense and unutterable fondness; when a cold,
shuddering fear came over her, lest those buds of life, so
fair, might be touched with sudden decay and go back, in
their brightness, to the dust. She lifted her voice in prayer
solemnly, passionately, earnestly, that the giver of life
would still spare to her those blossoms of love, over wliom
her soul thus yearned. As the low breathed accents rose
on the still air, a deepened thought came over her; her
pure spirit went out with her loved and pure ones into the
strange, wild paths of life; a strong horror chilled her
frame as she beheld mildew and blight settling on the fair
286and lovely of the earth, and high and rich hearts scathed
with desolating and guilty passion. The prayer she was
breathing grew yet more fervent, even to agony, that He,
who is the fountain of all purity, would preserve those
whom he had given her in their innocence, permitting
neither shame, nor crime, nor folly to cast a stain on the
brightness with which she had received them invested, from
His hands, as with a mantle.
As the prayer died away in the weakness of the spent
spirit, a pale shadowy form stood behind the infant sleepers. "L I am death," said the spectre, " and I come for
these thy babes-I am commissioned to bear them where
the perils you deprecate are unknown; where neither stain,
nor dust, nor shadow can reach the rejoicing spirit. It is
only by yielding them to me, you can preserve them fromn
contamination and decay." A. wild conflict-a struggle as
of the soul parting in strong agony, shook the mother's
frame; but faith, and the love which hath a purer fount
than that of earth-ward passions, triumphed; and she
yielded up her babes to the spectre.  ANONYMOUS.

STILL we spurred on, but our jaded horses at length sank
under us; and leaving them to find their way into the fields,
we struggled forward on foot. TIhe air had hitherto been
calm, but now, gusts began to rise, thunder growled, and
the signs of tempest thickened on. We gained an untouched quarter of the city, and had explored our weary
passage up to the gates of a large patrician palace, when
we were startled by a broad sheet of flame rushing through
the sky. The storm was come in its rage.'I'he range
of public magazines of wood, cordage, tar, and oil, in the
valley between the Caelian and Palatine hills, had at length
been involved in the conflagration. All that we had seen
before was darkness to the fierce splendour of this burning.
The tempest tore off the roofs, and swept them like floating islands of fire through the sky. The most distant
quarters on which they fell were instantly wrapped in
flame. One broad mass, whirling from an immense height,
broke upon the palace before us. A cry of terror was

heard within; the gates were flung open, and a crowd of
domestics and persons of both sexes, attired for a banquet,
poured out into the streets. The palace was wrapped in
flames. My guide then for the first time lost his self-possession. He staggered toward me with the appearance
of a man who had received a spear-head in his bosom. I
caught him before he fell; but his head sank, his knees
bent under him, and his white lips quivered with unintelligible sounds. I could distinguish only the words-" gone,
gone for ever!"
The flame had already seized upon the principal floors
of the palace; and the volumes of smoke that poured
through every window and entrance, rendered the attempt
to save those still within, a work of extreme hazard. But
ladders were rapidly placed, ropes were flung, and the
activity of the attendants and retainers was boldly exerted,
till all were presumed to have been saved, and the building
was left to burn.
My overwhelmed guide was lying on the ground, when
a sudden scream was heard, and a figure, in the robes
and with the rosy crown of the banquet-strange contrast to her fearful situation--was seen flying from window
to window in the upper part of the mansion. It was supposed that she had fainted in the first terror, and been forgotten. The height, the fierceness of the flame which
now completely mastered resistance, the volumes of smoke
that suffocated every man who approached, made the
chance of saving this unfortunate being utterly desperate in
the opinion of the multitude.
My spirits shuddered at the horrors of this desertion. I
looked round at my companion: he was kneeling, in helpless
agony, with his hands lifted up to heaven.  Another
scream, wilder than ever, pierced my senses. I seized an
axe from one of the domestics, caught a ladder from
another, and in a paroxysm of hope, fear, and pity, scaled
the burning wall. A shout from below followed me. I
entered the first window that I could reach. All before me
was cloud. I rushed on, struggled, stumbled over furniture and fragments of all kinds, fell, rose again, found myself trampling upon precious things, plate and crystal, and
still, axe in hand, forced my way. I at length reached the
banqueting-room. The figure had vanished. A strange
288superstition of childhood, a thought that I might have been
lured by some spirit of evil into the place of ruin, suddenly
came over me. I stopped to gather my faculties. I leaned
against one of the pillars; it was hot; the floor shook and
crackled under my tread, the walls heaved, the flame hissed
below, and overhead roared the whirlwind, a'nd burst the
thunder-peal.
My brain was fevered. The immense golden lamps still
burning; the long tables disordered, yet glittering with the
costly ornaments of patrician luxury; the scattered Tyrian
couches; the scarlet canopy that covered the whole range
of the tables, and gave the hall the aspect of an imperial
pavilion partially torn down in the confusion of the flight,
all assumed to me a horrid and bewildered splendour.
The smokes were already rising through the crevices of
the floor; the smell of flame was on my robes; a huge
volume of yellow vapour slowly wreathed and arched
round the chair at the head of the banquet. I could have
imagined a fearful lord of the feast under that cloudy veil!
Every thing round me was marked with preternatural fear,
magnificence, and ruin.
A low groan broke my reverie. I heard the voice of
one in despair. I heard the broken words, " O, bitter fruit
of disobedience!--0, my mother, shall I never see your
face again?-For one crime I am doomed. Eternal mercy,
let my crime be washed away--let my spirit ascend pure.
Farewell, mother, sister, father, husband."  With the last
word I heard a fall, as if the spirit had left the body.
I sprung toward the sound: I met but the solid wall,
"Horrible illusion," I cried--" am I mad, or the victim
of the powers of darkness?"  I tore away the hangingsa door was before me. I burst it through with a blow of
the axe, and saw stretched on the floor, and insensibleSalome!
I caught my child in my arms; I bathed her forehead
with my tears; I besought her to look up, to give some
sign of life, to hear the full forgiveness of my breaking
heart. She looked not, answered not, breathed not. To
make a last effort for her life, I carried her into the banquetroom'. But the fire had forced its way there; the wind
tursting in, had carried the flame through the long galleies; and flashes and spires of lurid light, already darting

through the doors, gave fearful evidence that the last stone
of the palace must soon go down.
I bore my unhappy daughter toward the window; but
the height was deadly; no gesture could be seen through
the piles of smoke; the help of man was in vain. To
my increased misery, the current of air revived Salome at
the instant when I hoped that, by insensibility, she would
escape the final pang. She breathed, stood, and, opening
her eyes, fixed on me the vacant stare of one scarcely
aroused from sleep. Still clasped in my arms, she gazed
again; but my wild face covered with dust, my half-burnt
hair, the axe gleaming in my hand, terrified her; she
uttered a scream, and darted away from me headlong into
the centre of the burning.
I rushed after her, calling on her name. A column of
fire shot up between us; I felt the floor sink; all was then
suffocation-I struggled, and fell.-       CROLY.
1 19.--EXTRACT FROM MR. WEBSTER S SPEECH ON THE TRIAL
OF J. F. KNAPP.
AGAINST the prisoner at the bar, as an individual, I cannot have the slightest prejudice. I would not do him the
smallest injury or injustice. But I do not affect to be
indifferent to the discovery, and the punishment of this deep
guilt. I cheerfully share in the opprobrium, how much
soever it may be, which is cast on those who feel and
manifest an anxious concern that all who had a part in
planning, or a hand in executing this deed of midnight
assassination, may be brought to answer for their enormous
crime at the bar of public justice. Gentlemen, it is a most
extraordinary case. In some respects it has hardly a precedent any where; certainly none in our New England
history. This bloody drama exhibited no suddenly excited,
ungovernable rage. The actors in it were not surprised by
any lion-like temptation upon their virtue, overcoming it
before resistance could begin. Nor did they do the deed
to glut savage vengeance, or satiate long settled and deadly
hate. It was a cool, calculating, money-making murder.
It was all "hire and salary, not revenge."  It was the
290weighing of money against life; the counting out of so
many pieces of silver, against so many ounces of blood.
An aged man without an enemy in the world, in his own
house, and in his own bed, is made the victim of butcherly
murder for mere pay. Truly, here is a new lesson for
painters and poets. Whoever shall hereafter draw the
portrait of murder, if he will show it as it has been exhibited in an example, where such example was last to
have been looked for, in the very bosom of our New England society, let him not give it the grim visage of Moloch,
the brow knitted by revenge, the face black with settled
hate, and the blood-shot eye emitting livid fires of malice;
-let him draw, rather, a decorous, smooth-faced, bloodless
demon; a picture in repose, rather than in action; not so
much an example of human nature in its depravity, and in
its paroxysms of crime, as an infernal nature,-a fiend in
the ordinary display and development of his character.
The deed was executed with a degree of self-possession
and steadiness, equal to the wickedness with which it was
planned. The circumstances now  clearly in evidence,
spread out the whole scene before us. Deep sleep had
fallen on the destined victim, and on all beneath his roof.
A healthful old man, to whom sleep was sweet--the first
sound slumbers of the night held him in their soft but
strong embrace. The assassin enters, through the window
already prepared, into an unoccupied apartment. With
noiseless foot he paces the lonely hall, half lighted by the
moon; he winds up the ascent of the stairs, and reaches
the door of the chamber. Of this he moves the lock, by
soft and continued pressure, till it turns on its hinges; and
he enters, and beholds his victim before him. T'he room
was uncommonly open to the admission of light. The
face of the innocent sleeper was turned from the murderer, and the beams of the moon, resting on the gray locks
of his aged temple, showed him where to strike. The fatal
blow is given!-and the victim passes, without a struggle
or a motion, from the repose of sleep to the repose of
death!--It is the assassin's purpose to make sure work;
and he yet plies the dagger, though it was obvious that life
had been destroyed by the blow of the bludgeon. He
even raises the aged arm, that he may not fail in his arm
at the heart; and replaces it again over the wounds of

the poniard! To finish the picture, he explores the wrist
for the pulse! he feels it, and ascertains that it beats no
longer!  It is accomplished. The deed is done. He
retreats, retraces his steps to the window, passes out
through it as he came in, and escapes. He has done the
murder-no eye has seen him, no ear has heard him.
The secret is his own, and it is safe!
Ah! gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a
secret can be safe nowhere. The whole creation of God
has neither nook nor corner, where the guilty can bestow
it, and say it is safe. Not to speak of that eye which
glances through all disguises, and beholds every thing as
in the splendour of noon,-such secrets of guilt are never
safe from detection, even by men. True it is, generally
speaking, that " murder will out."  True it is, that Providence hath so ordained, and doth so govern things, that
those who break the great law of heaven, by shedding
man's blood, seldom succeed in avoiding discovery. Especially, in a case exciting so much attention as this, discovery
must come, and will come, sooner or later. A thousand
eyes turn at once to explore every man, every thing, every
circumstance connected with the time and place; a thousand ears catch every whisper; a thousand excited minds
intensely dwell on the scene, shedding all their light, and
ready to kindle the slightest circumstance into a blaze of
discovery. Mean time the guilty soul cannot keep its own
secret. It is false to itself; or rather it feels an irresistible
impulse of conscience to be true to itself. It labours under
its guilty possession, and knows not what to do with it.
The human heart was not made for the residence of such an
inhabitant. It finds itself preyed on by a torment, which
it does not acknowledge to God nor man. A vulture is
devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance,
either from heaven or earth. The secret which the murderer possesses, soon comes to possess him; and, like the
evil spirits of which we read, it overcomes him, and leads
hin whithersoever it will. He feels it beating at his heart,
rising to his throat, and demanding disclosure. He thinks
the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes,
and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his
thoughts. It has become his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his pru292dence. When suspicions from without begin to embarrass
him, and the net of circumstances to entangle him, the fatal
secret struggles with still greater violence to burst forth.
It must be confessed, it will be confessed, there is no refuge
from confession but suicide, and suicide is confession.

120.-THE VALUE OF THE BIBLE.
ON casting a survey over the different orders into which
society is distributed, I am at an utter loss to fix on any
description of persons who are likely to be injured by the
most extensive perusal of the word of God. The poor, we
may be certain, will sustain no injury from their attentioi
to a bookl which while it inculcates, under the most awful
sanctions, the practice of honesty, industry, frugality, subordination to lawful authority, contentment, and resignation
to the allotments of providence, elevates them  to "an
inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not
away;" a book, which at once secures the observation of
the duties which attach to an inferior condition, and almost
annihilates its evils, by opening their prospects into a state
where all the inequalities of fortune will vanish, and the
obscurest and most neglected piety shall be crowned with
eternal glory. "The poor man rejoices that he is exalted;"
and while he views himself as a member of Christ, and
the heir of a blessed immortality, he can look with undissembled pity on the frivolous distinctions, the fruitless
agitations, and the fugitive enjoyments of the most eminent
and most prosperous of those who have their portion in
this world. The poor man will sustain no injury by
exchanging the vexations of envy for the quiet of a good
conscience, and fruitless repining for the consolations of
religious hope. The less is his portion in this life, the
more ardently will he cherish and embrace the promise of
a better, while the hope of that better exerts a reciprocal
influence, in prompting him to discharge the duties, and
reconciling him to the evils, which are inseparable from the
present. The Bible is the treasure of the poor, the solace
of the sick, and the support of the dying; and while other
books may amuse and instruct in a leisure hour, it is the
peculiar triumph of that book to create light in the midst
25*

of darkness, to alleviate the sorrow which admits of no
other alleviation, to direct a beam of hope to the heart
which no other topic of consol-ation can reach; while guilt,
despair, and death, vanish at the touch of its holy inspiration. There is something in the spirit and diction of the
Bible which is found peculiarly adapted to arrest the
attention of the plainest and most uncultivated minds.
The simple structure of its sentences, combined with a
lofty spirit of poetry,-its familiar allusions to the scenes
of nature, and the transadtions of common life,-the
delightful intermixture of narration witli the doctrinal -and
preceptive parts,-and the profusion of miraculous facts,
which convert it into a sort of enchanted ground,--its onstant advertence to the Deity, whose perfections it renders
almost visible and palpable,-unite in bestowing upon it all
interest which attaches to no other performance, and whiclh,
after assiduous and repeated perusal, invests it with much
of the charm of novelty; like the great orb of day, at whiclh
we are wont to gaze with unabated astonishment from infancy to old age. What other book, beside the Bible, could
be heard in public assemblies from year to year, with all
attention that never tires, and. an interest that never cloys?
With few exceptions, let a portion of the sacred volume be
recited in a mixed multitude, and though it has been heard
a thousand times, a universal stillness ensues; every eye is
fixed, and every ear is awake and attentive. Select, if you
can, any other coinposition, and let it be rendered equally

121.-THE PLEASURES AND PAINS OF THE STUDENT.
WHEN envious time, with unrelenting hand,
Dissolves the union of some little band,
A band, connected by those hallow'd ties,
That from the growth of letter'd friendship rise,
Each lingering soul, before the parting sigh,
One moment waits, to view the years gone by.
Memory still loves to hover round the place,
And all our pleasures and our pains retrace.
294The student is the subject of my song;Few are his pleasures; yet those few are strong.
Not the gay transient moment of delight;
Not hurried transports, felt but in their flight.
Unlike all else, the student's joys endure,
Intense, expansive, energetic, pure.
Whether o'er classic plains he loves to rove,
Midst Attic bowers, and through the Mantuan grove,
Whether with scientific eye, to trace
The various modes of number, time and space;
Whether on wings of heavenly truth to rise,
And penetrate the secrets of the skies,
Or downward tending, with an humbler eye,
Through nature's laws explore a deity;
His are the joys no stranger breast can feel,
No wit define, no utterance reveal.
Nor yet, alas, unmix'd the joys we boast;
Our pleasures still proportion'd labour cost.
An anxious tear oft fills the student's eye;
And his breast heaves with many a struggling sigh;
His is the task, the long, long task t' explore
Of every age the lumber and tile lore.
Need I describe his troubles and his strife?
The thousand minor miseries of his life?
How application, ever pouring maid,
Oft mourns an aching, oft a dizzy head?
How the hard toil but slowly works its way,
One word explain'd,-the labour of a day;Here forced to thread some labyrinth without end,
And there some paradox to comprehend;
Here ten hard words, fraught with some meaning small,
And there, ten folios, fraught-with none at all!
Or, view him, meting out with points and lines,
The land of diagrams, and mystic signs,
Where formns of spheres "being given" on a plane,
He must transform, and bend,-within his brain.
Or, as an author, lost in gloom profound,
When some bright thought demands a period round.
Pondering and polishing;-ah, what avail
The room oft paced, the anguish bitten nail?
For see, produced mid many a labouring groan,
A sentence, much like an inverted cone.
295
ROSE.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Or should he try his talent at a rhyme,
That waste of patience, and that waste of time,
Perchance, like me, he flounders through one line,
Begins the next-there stops.Enough; no more unveil the cloister's grief;
Disclose those sources whence it finds relief.
Say how the student, pausing from his toil,
Forgets his pain mid recreation's smile.
Have you not seen (forgive th' ignoble theme)
The winged tenants of some haunted stream,
Feed, eager, busy, all the wave beside,
Then wanton in the cool luxurious tide?
So the wise student ends his busy day,
Unbends his mind and throws his cares away.
To books where science urges toil severe,
Succeeds th' alluring tale, or drama dear;
Or haply in that hour, his taste might choose
The easy warblings of the modern muse.
Let me but paint him;-void of every care,
Flung in free attitudes along his chair,
From page to page his eye rapid along
Glances, and revels through the magic song.
Alternate swells his breast with hope and fear,
Now bursts th' unconscious laugh;-now falls the pitying tear.
Yet more;-though lonely joys the bosom warm,
Participation heightens every charm.
And should the happy student chance to know
The warmth of friendship,-or, some kinder glow,
What wonder, should he eager run to share
Some favourite author with some favourite fair?
There, as he cites those treasures of the page
That raise her fancy, or her heart engage,
And listens while her frequent, keen remark
Discerns the brilliant, or illumes the dark;
And doubting much, scarce knows which most to admire,
The critic's judgment, or the writer's fire;
While, reading, oft he glances at that face,
Where gently beams intelligence and grace,
And sees each passion in its turn prevail,
Her looks the very echo of the tale;
296Sees the descending tear, the swelling breast
When vice exults, or virtue is distrest;
Or when the plot assumes an aspect new,
And virtue shares her retribution due,
Sees the gay, grateful smile, th' uplifted eye,
Thread, needle, kerchief! dropt in ecstasySay, can one social pleasure equal this?
Yet still e'en here, imperfect is the bliss.
For ah, how oft must awkward learning yield
To graceful dulness the unequal field
Of gallantry; what lady can endure
The shrug scholastic and,the bow demure?
Can the poor student hope that heart to gain,
Which melts before the flutter of a cane?
Or, of two candidates, pray which can pass,
Where one consults his books, and one his glass?
Ye fair, if aught these censures may apply,'Tis yours alone to effect the remedyv.
Ne'er let the fop the sacred bond remove
That links the Paphian with th' Aonian grove.'Tis yours to polish, strengthen and secure
The lustre of the mind's rich garniture.
Such is the robe that lends you heavenly charms,
And envy of its fiercest sting disarms;
A robe, whose grace and briglitness will outvie
The woof of Ormus, and the Tyrian dye.
To count one pleasure more indulge my mnuse;'Tis friendship's self; what cynic will refuse?
O, I could tell how oft her joys we've shared,
When mutual cares those mutual joys endear'd.
How oft relaxing from one common toil,
We found repose amid one common smile.
How arm in arm we've linger'd through the vale,
Listening to many a time beguiling tale;
Yes, I could tell,-but 0! the task how vain!'Twould but increase our fast approaching pain,The pain, so thrilling to a student's heart,
Couch'd in that talisman of wo, --"IWe part."

122.---MARY ANNA GIBBES; THE YOUNG HEROINE OF STONO
STONO, on thy still banks
The roar of war is heard; its thunders swell
And shake yon mansion where domestic love
rill now breathed simple kindness to the heart;
Where white-arm'd childhood twined the neck of age,
Where hospitable cares lit up the hearth,
Cheering the lonely traveller on his way.
A foe inhabits there, and they depart,
Th' infirm old- man, and his fair household too,
Seeking another home.--Home! Who can tell
The touching power of that most sacred word,
Save he who feels and weeps that he has none?
Among that group of midnight exiles fled
Young Mary Anna, on whose youthful cheek
But thirteen years had kiindled up the rose.
A laugl-hing creature, breathing heart and love,
Yet timid as the fawn in southern wilds.
E'en the night reptile on the dewy grass
Startled the maiden, and the silent stars
Looking so still from out their cloudy home'I'roubled her mind. No time was there for gauds
And toilet art, in this quick flight of fear;
Her glossy hair, damp'd by the midnight winds,
Lay on her neck dishevell'd; gather'd round
Her form in hurried folds clung her few garments;
Now a quick thrilling sob, half grief, half dread,
Came bursting from her heart,--and now her eyes
Glared forth, as peal'd the cannon; then beneath
Their drooping lids, sad tears redundant flow'd.
But sudden mid the group a cry arose,
"Fenwick! where is he?" None return'd reply,
But a sharp, piercing glance went out, around,
Keen as a mother's toward her infant child
When sudden danger lowers, and then a shriek
From one, from all burst forth-" He is not here!"
Poor boy, he slept, nor crash of hurrying guns,
Nor impious curses, nor the warrior's shout
298GILMAN.                  2
Awoke his balmy rest! He dreamt such dreams
As float round childhood's couch, of angel faces
Peering through clouds;-of sunny rivulets,
Where the fresh stream flows rippling on, to waft
A tiny sail;-and of his rabbits white,
With eyes of ruby, and his tender fawn's
Long delicate limbs, light tread, and graceful neck,
He slept unconscious.-Who shall wake that sleep?
All shrink, for now th' artillery louder roars;The frighten'd slaves crouch at their master's side,
And he, infirm and feeble, scarce sustains
His sinking weight.
There was a pause, a hush
So deep, that one could hear the forest leaves
Flutter and drop between the war-gun's peal.
Then forward stood that girl, young Mary Anna,
The tear dried up upon her cheek, the sob
Crush'd down, and in that high and lofty tone
Which sometimes breathes of woman in the child,
She said "He shall not die"-and turn'd alone.
Alone? 0 gentle girlhood, not alone
Art thou if One watching above will guard
Thee on thy way.
Clouds shrouded up the stars;On-on she sped, the gun's broad glare her beacon!
The wolf growl sounded near,-on-onward still;
The forest trees like warning spirits moan'd,She press'd her hands against her throbbing heart,
But falter'd not. The whizzing shot went by,
Scarce heeded went.-Pass'd is a weary mile
With the light step a master spirit gives
On duty's road, and she has reach'd her home.
Her home-is this her home at whose fair gate
Stern foes in silence stand to bar her way?
That gate, which from her infant childhood leap'd
On its wide hinges glad at her return?
Before the sentinels she trembling stood,
And with a voice, whose low and tender tones
Rose like the ring-dove's in midsummer storms,
She said,
"Please let me pass, and seek a child,
99THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Who, in my father's mansion has been left
Sleeping, unconscious of the danger near."
While thus she spake a smile incredulous
Stole o'er the face of one,-the other cursed
And barr'd her from the way.
" 0O, sirs," she cried,
While from her upraised eyes the tears stream'd dowll,
And her small hands were clasp'd in agony,
" Drive me not hence, I pray. Until to-night
I dared not stray beyond my nurse's side
In the dim twilight; yet I now have come
Alone, unguarded, this far dreary mile,
By darkness unappall'd;--a simple worm
Would often fright my heart, and bid it flutter,
But now I've heard the wild wolf's hungry howl
With soul undaunted-till to-night, I've shrunk
From men;--and soldiers! scarcely dared I look
Upon their glittering arms;-but here I come
And sue to you, men, warriors;-drive me not
Away. He whom I seek is yet a child,
A prattling boy, and must he, must he die?
0, if you love your children, let me pass.You will not? Then my strength and hope are gone,
And I shall perish, e'er I reach my friends."
And then she press'd her brow, as if those hands
So soft and small, could still its throbbing pulse.
The sentinels look'd calmly on, like men
Whose blades had toy'd with sorrow and made sport
Of wo. One step the maiden backward took,
Lingering in thought, then hope like a soft flush
Of struggling twilight kindled in her eyes.
She knelt before them and reurged her plea.
"Perchance you have a sister, sir, or you,
A poor young thing like me; if she were here
Kneeling like me before my countrymen,
They would not spurn her thus!"
" Go, girl-pass on--
The soften'd voice of one replied, nor was
She check'd, nor waited she to hear repulse,
But darted through the avenue, attain'd
The hall, and-springing up the well known stairs
SooWith such a flight as the young eagle takes
To gain its nest, she reach'd the quiet couch,
Where in bright dreams th' unconscious sleeper lay.
Slight covering o'er the rescued boy she threw,
And caught him in her arms. He knew that cheek,
Kiss'd it half-waking, then around her neck
His hands entwined, and dropp'd to sleep again.
She bore him onward, dreading now for him
The shot that whizz'd along, and tore the earth
In fragments by her side. She reach'd the guards,
Who silent oped the gate,-then hurried on,
But as she pass'd them, from her heart burst forth" God bless you, gentlemen!" then urged her way;
Those arms, whose heaviest load and task had been
To poise her doll, and wield her childhood's toys,
Bearing the boy along the dangerous road.
Voices at length she hears--her friends are near,
They meet, and yielding up her precious charge,
She sinks upon her father's breast, in doubt'Twixt smiles and tears.                  GILMAN

Then from unnumber'd sheaths at once, the beaming blades
upstream'd,
SVowed scabbardless till waved the cross above that tomb
redeem'd.
But suddenly a holy awe the vengeful clamour still'd,
As sinks the storm before his breath, whose word its rising
will'd;
For conscience whisper'd, the same soil where they so
proudly stood,
The Son of Man had trod abased, and wash'd with tears
and blood.'I'hen dropp'd the squire his master's shield, the serf dash'd
down his bow,
And, side by side with priest and peer, bent reverently
and low,
While sunlk at once each pennon'd spear, plumed helm and
flashing glaive,
Like some wide waste of reeds bow'd down by Niluss
swollen wave.
From eyes that never wept till then, the warm tears fell like
rain,Proud Tancred's eagle glance was dimm'd, loud sobb'd the
good Lorraine;
Arid'twas a blessed sight to see each warrior fierce and
wild
Beconle before his God that hour e'en as a little child.
With chasten'd souls and holier thoughts, the legions slowly
rose--
Wrongs were forgot, and feuds were heal'd between the
deadliest foes;
Priests doffd their sandals, harness'd knights their mailclad feet unshod,
And like unshriven penitents that hallow'd soil they trod.
But where were all that peerless host, the flower of every
land,
That late before Byzantium their giant conquests plann'd?
Trhe swarms of high soul'd chivalry that throng'd the Nissian plain,
The leagues of spears that quiver'd there, like fields of golden
grain?THE SOUTHERN SPEAKER.
Of that vast bounding human flood, this host was but a
wave:
Where were the burnish'd myriads gone?  Go, ask the
desert grave!
The Arab's creese, the Persian's lance, the Tartar's bow
and swordTheir edge and point perchance may tell where sleep that
boasting horde!
Around the towers of Antioch, beneath Edessa's wall,
The moving sands, for miles around, form'd one wide
heaving pall:
The spotted pestilence with war, awhile the feast had shared,
And famine clung the drooping wreck that swift destruction
spared.
Yet were those visitations just: licentiousness and shame
Had quench'd with steaming infamy the pure chivalric
flame,
And sin, and all to which it leads, had check'd their proud
career,
Far more than shaft of Tartar bow, or charge of Syrian
spear.
But death hath struck to purify: the stern, unwavering feM
Whose virtue pleasure could not tempt, nor avarice subdue,
Escaped the Moslem cimeter, the toils of Grecian fraud,
Spread on Judean winds at last the banner'd cross abroad
What though the haughty Saracen now held each wall an(
tower:
Soon to the symbol of their faith, the crescent flag woul4
lower,-          -
Soon would the blades of Christendom within the barriers
glance,
And soon the blood of Moslem dogs course down the Latin
lance.
And so it was: the walls were won--then murder bared
his arm i
From Omar's mosque to Herod's gate, red streams flow'd
thick and warm;
And o'er a city drench'd in gore, ere massacre could cease,
The holy standard they upraised of HIM the Prince of Peace.

124.-JAMES OGLETHORPE.
JAMES OGLETHORPE, the founder of Georgia, was born in
England, about the year 1688. Entering the army at an
early age, he served under Prince Eugene, to whom he
became secretary and aid-de-camp. On the restoration of
peace, he was returned a member of parliament, and
distinguished himself as a useful legislator, by proposing
several regulations for the benefit of trade, and a reform
in the prisons.  His philanthropy is commemorated iii
Thomson's Seasons.
In 1732, he became one of the trustees of Georgia. In
the prosecution of this trust, Mr. Oglethorpe embarked in
November, with a number of emigrants, and, arriving at
Charleston, in the middle of January, 1733, proceeded
immediately to Savannah river, and laid the foundation of
the town of Savannah. He made treaties with the Indians,
and crossed the Atlantic several times, to promote the
interests of the colony.
Being appointed general and commander in chief of his
majesty's forces, in South Carolina and Georgia, he brought
from England in 1738, a regiment of six hundred men, to
protect the southern frontier from the Spaniards. After the
commencement of the war between Great Britain and
Spain, in 1739, he visited the Indians, to secure their
friendship; and, in 1740, conducted an unsuccessful expedition against St. Augustine.
As the Spaniards laid claim to Georgia, three thousand
men, a part of whom  were from Havanna, were sent, in
1742, to drive Oglethorpe from the frontiers. When this
force proceeded up the Altamaha, he was obliged to retreat
to Frederica. He had but about seven hundred men, besides
Indians: yet, with a part of these, he approached within
two miles of the enemy's camp, with the design of attacking them by surprise, when a French soldier, of his party,
fired his musket, and ran into the Spanish lines.
His situation was now very critical; for he knew that
the deserter would make known his weakness. Returning,
however, to Frederica, he had recourse to the following
expedient. He wrote a letter to the'deserter, desiring him
to acquaint the Spaniards with the defenceless state of Frederica, and to urge them to the attack. If he could not
304RAMSAY.                    305
effect this object, Oglethorpe directed him to use all his art
to persuade them to stay three days at fort Simon's; as,
within that time, he should have a reinforcement of two
thousand land forces, with six ships of war; cautioning him,
at the same time, not to drop a hint of Admiral Vernon's
meditated attack upon St. Augustine.
A Spanish prisoner was intrusted with this letter, under
promise of delivering it to the deserter: but he gave it, as
was expected and intended, to the commander in chief, who
instantly put the deserter in irons. In the perplexity occasioned by this letter, while the enemy was deliberating what
measures to adopt, three ships of force, which the governor
of South Carolina had sent to Oglethorpe's aid, appeared
on the coast.
The Spanish commander was now convinced, beyond all
question, that the letter, instead of being a stratagem, contained serious instructions to a spy; and, in this moment
of consternation, set fire to the fort, and embarked so precipitately, as to leave behind him a number of cannon, with
a quantity of military stores. Thus by an event beyond
human foresight or control, by the correspondence between
the artful suggestions of a military genius, and the blowing
of the winds, was the infant colony saved from destruction,
and Oglethorpe gained the character of an able general.
He now returned to England, and never again revisited
Georgia. In 1745, he was promoted to the rank of major
general, and was sent against the rebels, but did not overtake them; for which he was tried by a court martial, and
honourably acquitted.
After the return of Gage to England, in 1775, the command of the British army, in America, was offered to
General Oglethorpe. He professed his readiness to accept
the appointment, if the ministry would authorize him to
assure the colonies that justice would be done them: but
the command was given to Sir William Howe.
He died in August, 1785, at the age of ninety-seven;
being the oldest general in the service. Nine years before
his death, the province of Georgia, of which he was the
father, was raised to the rank of a sovereign, independent
state, and had been for two years acknowledged as such
by the mother country, under whose auspices it had been
plainted.                                     RAMSAY.

125.--ADDRESS OF DANIEL WEBSTER TO THE SURVIVORS OF
THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL, DELIVERED AT THE LAYING
OF THE CORNER-STONE OF THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT.
VENERABLE MEN! YOU have come down to us from a
former generation. Heaven has bounteously lengthened
out your lives, that you might behold this joyous day. You
are now where you stood, fifty years ago, this very hour,
with your brothers, and your neighbours, shoulder to shoulder, in the strife for your country. Behold, how altered!
The same heavens are indeed over your heads; the same
ocean rolls at your feet; but all else how changed!
You hear now no roar of hostile cannon, you see no mixed
volumes of smoke and flame rising from burning Charlestown. The ground strewed with the dead and the dying;
the impetuous charge; the steady and successful repulse;
the loud call to repeated assault; the summoning of all that
is manly to repeated resistance; a thousand bosoms freely
and fearlessly bared in an instant to whatever of terror there
may be in war and death;-all these you have witnessed,
but you witness them no more. All is peace. The heights
of yonder metropolis, its towers and roofs, which you then
saw filled with wives and children. and countrymen in distress and terror, and looking with unutterable emotions for
the issue of the combat, have presented you to-day with
the sight of its whole happy population, come out to welcome and greet you with an universal jubilee. Yonder
proud ships, by a felicity of position appropriately lying
at the foot of this mount, and seeming fondly to cling around
it, are not means of annoyance to you, but your country's
own means of distinction and defence. All is peace; and
God has granted you this sight of your country's happiness,
ere you slumber in the grave for ever. He has allowed
you to behold and to partake the reward of your patriotic
toils; and he has allowed us, your sons and countrymen,
to meet you here, and in the name of the present generation,
in the name of your country, in the name of liberty to
thank you!
But, alas! you are not all here! Time and the sword
have thinned your ranks. Prescot, Putnam, Stark, Brooks,
Read, Pomeroy, Bridge! our eyes seek for you in vain
amid this broken band. You are gathered to your fathers,
306and live only to your country in her grateful remembrance,
and your own bright example. But let us not too much
grieve, that you have met the common fate of men.  You
lived, at least, long enough to know that your work had
been nobly and successfully accomplished. You lived to
see your country's independence established, and to sheathe
your swords from war. On the light of liberty you saw
arise the light of peace, like'another morn,
Risen on midnoon;'and the sky, on which you closed your eyes, was cloudless.
But--ah!-him! the first great martyr in this great
cause! Him! the premature victim of his own self-devoting heart! Him! the head of our civil councils, and the
destined leader of our military bands; whom  nothing
brought hither but the unquenchable fire of his own spirit;
him! cut off by Providence, in the hour of overwhelming
anxiety and thick gloom; falling, ere he saw the star of his
country rise; pouring out his generous blood, like water,
before he knew whether it would fertilize a land of freedom
or of bondage! how shall I struggle with the emotions that
stifle the utterance of thy name!--Our poor work may
perish; but thine shall endure!  This monument may
moulder away; the solid ground it rests upon may sink
down to a level with the sea; but thy memory shall not
fail! Wheresoever among men a heart shall be found that
beats to the transports of patriotism and liberty, its aspirations shall be to claim kindred with thy spirit.
But the scene amid which we stand does not permit us
to confine our thoughts or our sympathies to those fearless
spirits, who hazarded or lost their lives on'this consecrated
spot. We have the happiness to rejoice here in the presence of a most worthy representation of the survivors of
the whole revolutionary army.
Veterans! you are the remnant of many a well fought
field. You bring with you marks of honour from Trenton
an(l Monmouth, from Yorktown, Camden, Bennington,
and Saratoga. Veterans of half a century! when in your
youthful days, you put every thing at hazard in your country's cause, good as that cause was, and sanguine as youth
is, still your fondest hopes dil not stretch onward to an
hlour like this! At a period to which you could not reason307

and I turn from it. May the Father of all mercies smile
upon your declining years, and bless them!  And when
you shall here have exchanged your embraces; when you
shall once more have pressed the hands which have been
so often extended to give succour in adversity, or grasped
in the exultation of victory; then look abroad into this
lovely land, which your younig valour defended, and mark
the happiness with which it is filled; yea, look abroad into
the whole earth, and see what a name you have contributed
to give to your country, anld what a praise you have added
to freedom, and then rejoice in the sympathy and gratitude
which beam upon your last days from the improved condition of mankind.                             WEBSTER.
126.--THE PATRONAGE OF SOVEREIGNS.
ABOUT half a league from the little sea port of Palos, in
the province of Andalusia, in Spain, stands a convent dedicated to St. Mary. Some timne in the year 1486, a pooi
way-faring stranger, accompanied by a small boy, makes
his appearance, on foot, at the gate of this convent, an6
begs of the porter a little bread and water for his child.
This friendless stranger is Columbus. Brought up in the
hardy pursuit of a mariner, with no other relaxation from
its toils but that of an occasional service in the fleets of
his native country, with the burden of fifty years upon his
frame, the unprotected foreigner makes his suit to the
haughty sovereigns of Portugal and Spain. He tells them,
that the broad flat earth on which we tread, is round;-he
proposes, with what seems a sacrilegious hand, to lift the
veil which had hung, from the creation of the world, over
the floods of the ocean;-he promises, by a western course,
308to reach the eastern shores of Asia,-the region of gold,
and diamonds, and spices; to extend the sovereignty of
Christian kings over realms and nations hitherto unapproached and unknown;--and ultimately to perforin a new
crusade to the holy land, and ransom thle sepulchre of our
Saviour with the new found gold of the east.
Who shall believe the chimerical pretension?  The
learned men examine it, and pronounce it futile. The royal
pilots have ascertained by their own experience that it is
groundless. The priesthood have considered it, and have
pronounced that sentence so terrific wlhere the inquisition
reigns, that it is a wicked heresy;--the common sense, and
popular feeling of men, have been roused first into disdainful and then into indignant exercise, toward a project,
which, by a strange new chimera, represented one half of
mankind walking with their feet toward the other half.
Such is the reception which his proposal meets.  For a
long time, the great cause of humanity, depending on the
discovery of these fair continents, is involved in the fortitude, perseverance, and spirit of the solitary stranger,
already past the time of life, when the pulse of adventure
beats full and high. If he sink beneath the indifference of
the great, the sneers of the wise, the enmity of the mass,
and the persecution of a host of adversaries, high and low,
and give up the fruitless and thankless pursuit of his noble
vision, what a hope for mankind is blasted! But he does
not sink. He'shakes off his paltry enemies, as the lion
shakes the dew drops from his mane. That consciousness
of motive and of strength, which always supports the man
who is worthy to be supported, sustains him in hlis hour
of trial; and at length, after years of expectation, importunity, and hope deferred, he launches forth upon the unknown deep, to discover a new world, under the patronage
of Ferdinand and Isabella.
The patronage of Fetdinand and Isabella!--Let us dwell
for a moment on the auspices under which our country was
brought to light. Trhepatronage of Ferdinand and Isabella!
Yes, doubtless, they have fitted out a convoy, worthy the
noble temper of the man, and the gallantry of his project.
Convinced at length, that it is no daydream of a heated
visionary, the fortunate sovereigns of Castile and Arragon,
returning from their triumph over the last of the Moors,

and putting a victorious close to a war of seven centuries
duration, have no doubt prepared an expedition of well
appointed magnificence, to go out upon this splen(lid search
for other worlds. They have made ready, l;o doubt, their
proudest galleon, to waft the heroic adventurer upon his
path of glory, with a whole armada of kindred spirits, to
share his toils and honours.
Alas, from his ancient resort of Palos, which he first
approached as a mendicant,--in three frail barks, of which
two were without decks,-the great discoverer of America
sails forth on the first voyage across the unexplored waters.
Such is the patronage of kings. A few years pass by; he
discovers a new hemisphere; the wildest of his visions
fade into insignificance before the reality of their fulfilmlent;
he finds a new world for Castile and Leon, and comes back
to Spain loaded with iron fetters. Republics, it is said,
are ungrateful;--such are the rewards of monarchs.

Stout hearted dames were they;
With nerve to wield the battle brand,

How shared they, with each dauntless band,
War's tempest, and life's toil!
They shrank not from the foemanThey quail'd not in the fightBut cheer'd their husbands through the day,
And soothed them through the night.

Their bosoms pillow'd men!
And proud were they by such to stana,

But their graves shall yet be found,
And their monuments dot here and there

128.--EXTRACT FROM THE PARTISAN.
THESE old woods about Dorchester are famous.  There
is not a wagon track--not a defile-not a clearing--not a
traverse of these plains, which has not been consecrated by
the strife for liberty; the close strife-the desperate struggle; the contest, unrelaxing, unyielding to the last, save
only with death or conquest. These old trees have looked
down upon blood and battles; the thick array and tile solitary combat between single foes, needing no other witnesses.
What tales might they not tell us! The sands have drunk
deeply of holy and hallowed blood--blood that gave them
value and a name, and made for them a place in all human
recollection. The grass here has been beaten dom n. in:91I

successive seasons, by heavy feet--by conflicting horsemen
--by driving and recoiling artillery. Its deep green has
been dyed with a yet (leeper and a darker stain-the outpourings of the invader's veins, mingling with the generous
streams flowing from bosoms that had but one hope-but
one purpose-the unpolluted freedom and security of home;
the purity of the threshold, the sweet repose of the domestic hearth from the intrusion of hostile feet-the only
objects, for which men may brave the stormy and tlle brutal
strife, and still keep the " whiteness of their souls."
The Carolinian well knows these old time places; for
every acre has its tradition in this neighbourhood. He
rides beneath the thick oaks, whose branches have covered
regiments, and looks up to them with regardful veneration.
Well he remembers the old defile at the entrance just above
Dorchester village, where a red clay hill rises abruptly,
breaking pleasantly the dead level of country all around it.
The rugged limbs and trunk of a huge oak, which hung
above its brow, and has been but recently overthrown, was
of itself his historian. It was notorious in tradition as the
gallows oak; its limbs being employed by both parties, as
they severally obtained the ascendancy, for the purposes
of summary execution. Famous, indeed, was all the partisan warfare in this neighbourhood, from the time of its
commencement, with our story, in 1780, to the day, when,
hopeless of their object, the troops of the invader withdrew to their crowded vessels, flying from the land they
had vainly struggled to subdue. You should hear the old
housewives dilate upon these transactions.  You should
hear them paint the disasters, the depression of the Carolinians! how their chief city was besieged and taken; their
little army dispersed or cut to pieces; and how the invader
marched over the country, and called it his. Anon, they
would show you the little gathering in the swamp--the small
scouting squad timidly stealing forth into the plain, and
contenting itself with cutting off a foraging party or a
baggage wagon, or rescuing a disconsolate group of captives
on their way to the city and the prison ships. Soon, imboldened by success, the little squad is increased by numbers,
and aims at larger game. Under some such leader as Colornel Washington, you should see them, anon, well mounted,
streaking along the Ashley river road, by the peep of (lay,well skilled in the management of their steeds, whose high
necks beautifully arch under the curb, while, in obedience
to their riders' will, they plunge fearlessly through brake
and through brier, over the fallen tree, and into the suspicious water  Heedless of all things but the proper achievement of their bold adventure, the warriors go onward,
while the broadswords flash in the sunlight, and the trumpet cheers them with a tone of victory. And goodlier still
is the sight, when, turning the narrow lane, thick fringed
with the scrubby oak and the pleasant myrtle, you behold
them come suddenly to the encounter with the hostile invaders. How they hurra, and rush to the charge with a
mad emotion that the steed partakes-his ears erect, and
his nostrils distended, while his eyeballs start forward, and
grow red with the straining effort; then, how the riders
bear down all before them, and, with swords shooting out
from their cheeks, make nothing of the upraised bayonet
and pointed spear, but, striking in, flank and front, carry
confusion wherever they go-while the hot sands drink in
the life blood of friend and foe, streaming through a thou
sand wounds. Hear them tell of these, and of the "game
cock," Sumter; how, always ready for fight, with a valour
which was frequently rashness, he would rush into the
hostile ranks, and, with his powerftll frame and sweeping
sabre, would single out for inveterate strife his own particular enemy. Then, of the subtle " swamp fox," Marion,
who, slender of form, and having but little confidence in his
own physical prowess, was never seen to use his sword in
battle; gaining by stratagem and unexpected enterprise
those advantages which his usual inferiority of force would
never have permitted him to gain otherwise. They will
tell you of his conduct and his coolness; of his ability,
with small means, to consummate leading objects-the best
proof of military talent; and of his wonderful command
of his men; how they would do his will, though it led to
the most perilous adventure, with as much alacrity as if
they were going to a banquet. Of the men themselves,
though in rags, almost starving, and exposed to all changes
of the weather, how cheerfully, in the fastnesses of the
swamp, they would sing their rude song about the capacity
of their leader and their devotion to his person, in some
such strain as that which follows:27

SIMS.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER,
THE SWAMP FOX.
I.
We follow where the Swamp Fox guides
His friends and merry men are we;
And when the troop of Tarleton rides,
We burrow in the cypress tree.
The turfy tussock is our bed,
Our home is in the red deer's den,
Our roof, the tree top overhead,
For we are wild and hunted men.
II.
We fly by day, and shun its light;
But, prompt to strike the sudden blow
We mount, and start with early night,
And through the forest track our foe.
And soon he hears our chargers leap,
The flashing sabre blinds his eyes,
And ere he drives away his sleep,
And rushes from his camp, he dies.
III.
Free bridle-bit, good gallant steed,
That will not ask a kind caress,
To swim the Santee at our need,
When on his heels the foemen press--
The true heart and the ready hand,
The spirit stubborn to be freeThe twisted bore, the smiting brand-.
And we are Marion's men you see.
Iv.
Now light the fire, and cook the meal,
The last, perhaps, that we shall taste;
I hear the swamp fox round us steal,
And that's a sign we move in haste.
He whistles to the scouts, and hark!
You hear his order calm and low--
Come, wave your torch across the dark
And let us see the boys that go.
V.
We may not see their forms again,
God help'em should they find the strife
For they are strong and fearless men,
And make no coward terms for life:
{14SIMMS.
They'll fight as long as Marion bids,
And when he speaks the word to shy,
Then--not till then-they turn their steeds,
Through thickening shade and swamp to fly
VI.
Now stir the fire, and lie at ease,
The scouts are gone, and on the brush
I see the colonel bend his knees,
To take his slumbers too-but hush!
He's praying, comrades:'tis not strange;
The man that's fighting day by day,
May well, when night comes, take a change,
And down upon his knees to pray.
VII.
Break up that hcecake, boys, and hand
The sly and silent jug that's there;
I love not it should idle stand,
When Marion's men have need of cheer.'Tis seldom that our luck affords
A stuff like this we just have quaff'd,
And dry potatoes on our boards
May always call for such a draught.
VIII.
Now pile the brush anac roll the log:
Hard pillow, but a soldier's head,
That's half the time in brake and bog
Must never think of softer bed.
The owl is hooting to the night,
The cooter crawling e'er the bank,
And in that pond the plashing light,
Tells where the alligator sank.
IX.
What--'tis the signal! start so soon,
And through the Santee swamp so deep,
Without the aid of friendly moon,
And we, heaven help us, half asleep!
But courage, comrades, Marion leads,
The swamp fox takes us out to-night;
So clear your swords, and coax your steeds,
There's goodly chance, I think, of fight.
X.
We follow where the swamp fox guides,
We leave the swamp and cypress tree,
Our spurs are in our coursers' sides,
And ready for the strife are we315THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
The tory camp is now in sight,
And there he cowers within his denHe hears our shout, he dreads the fight,
He fears, and flies from Marion's men.
And gallant men they were--taught by his precept and
example, their own peculiar deeds grow famous in our
story. Each forester became in time an adroit partisan;
learned to practise a thousand stratagems, and most generally with a perfect success. Imbedding himself in the covering leaves and branches of the thick limbed tree, he would
lie in wait till the fall of evening; then, dropping suddenly
upon the shoulders of the sentry as he paced beneath, would
drive the keen knife into his heart, before he could yet
recover from his panic. Again, he would burrow in the
hollow of the miry ditch, and crawling, Indian fashion, into
the trench, wait patiently until the soldier came into the
moonlight, when the silver drop at his rifle's muzzle fell
with fatal accuracy upon his button, or his breastplate, and
the sharp sudden crack which followed almost invariably
announced the victim's long sleep of death. And numerous besides were the practices, of which tradition and
history alike agree to tell us, adopted in the war of our
revolution by the Carolina partisan, to neutralize the superiority of European force and tactics. Often and again
have they lain close to the gushing spring, and silent in the
bush, like the tiger in his jungle, awaiting until the foragers
had squatted around it for the enjoyment of their midday
meal; then, rushing forth with a fierce halloo, seize upon
the stacked arms, and beat down the surprised but daring
soldiers who might rise up to defend them. And this sort of
warfare, small though it may appear, was at last triumphant. The successes of the whigs, during the whole period
of the revolutionary contest in the South, were almost
entirely the result of the rapid, unexpected movement-the
sudden stroke made by the little troop, familiar with its
ground, knowing its object, and melting away at the
approach of a superior enemy, like so many dusky shadows,
secure in the thousand swamp recesses which surrounded
them. Nor did they rely always on stratagem in the prosecution of their enterprises. There were gleams of chivalry thrown athwart this sombre waste of strife and bloodshed, worthy of the middle ages. Bold and graceful riders,
316with fine horses, ready in all cases, fierce in onset, and
reckless in valour, the southern cavalry had an early renown.
rhe audacity with which they drove through the forest,
through broad rivers, such as the Santee, by day and by
night, in the face of the enemy, whether in flight or in assault
the same, makes their achievements as worthy of romance
as those of a Bayard or Bernardo. Thousands of instances
are recorded of that individual gallantry-that gallantry,
stimulated by courage, warmed by enthusiasm, and refined
by courtesy --which gives the only credentials of true
chivalry. Such, among the many, was the rescue of the
prisoners, by Jasper and Newton; the restoration of the
flagstaff to Fort Moultree, in the hottest fire by the former;
and the manner in which he got his death wound at Savannah, in carrying off the colours which had been intrusted
to him. Such were many of the rash achievements of
Sumter and Laurens, and such was the daring of the brave
Conyers, who daily challenged his enemy in the face of the
hostile army. These were all partisan warriors, and such
were their characteristics.                    SIMMs.

Had I, when speaking in the assembly, been absolute and independent master of affairs, then your other speakers might call me to account. But if ye were ever present, if ye were all in general invited to
propose your sentiments, if ye were all agreed that the measures then
suggested were really the best; if you, _Eschines, in particular, were
thus persuaded, (and it was no partial affection for me, that prompted
you to give me up the hopes, the applause, the honours, which attended
that course I then advised, but the superior force of truth, and your
utter inability to point out any more eligible' course;) if this was the

Since then, every sort of good which is immediately of importance to

a place in the theories of the wildest projectors; that it
rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish. No,
my countrymen; shut your ears against this unhallowed
language.
Shut your heart against the poison which it conveys:
the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American
citizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defence
of their sacred rights, consecrate their union, and excite
horror at the idea of their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies.
And if novelties are to be shunned, believe me, the most
alarming of all novelties, the most wild of all projects, the
most rash of all attempts, is that of rending us in pieces,
in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness.
But why is the experiment of an extended republic to be
rejected merely because it may comprise what is new? Is
it not the glory of the people of America, that while they
have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times
and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration
for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the
suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their
own situation, and the lessons of their own experience?
To this manly spirit, posterity will be indebted for the
possession, and the world for the example, of the numerous
innovations displayed on the American theatre, in favour
of private rights and public happiness.
Had no important step been taken by the leaders of the
revolution, for which a precedent could not be discovered,
no government established of which an exact model did not
present itself, the people of the United States might, at
this moment, have been numbered among the melancholy
victims of misguided councils: must, at best, have been
labouring under the weight of some of those forms which
have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind.
Happily for America, happily we trust for the whole
human race, they pursued a new and more noble course.
They accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in
the annals of human society. They reared the fabric
of governments which have no model on the face of the
globe. They formed the design of a great confederacy,
which it is incumbent on their successors to improve and
perpetuate.

If their works betray imperfections, no wonder at the
fewness of them. If they erred most in the structure of
the union, this was the most difficult to be executed; this

130.-EXTRACT FROM PRESIDENT JEFFERSON'S INAUGURAL
ADDRESS.
DURING the contest of opinion through which we have
passed, the animation of discussions and of exertions has
sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers, unused to think freely, and to speak and to write what
they think; but this being now decided by the voice of the
nation, announced according to the rules of the constitution,
all will, of course, arrange themselves under the will of the
law, and unite in common efforts for the common good.
All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that,
though the will of the majority is, in all cases, to prevail,
that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that the
minority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must
protect, and to violate which would be oppression. Let us
then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind.
Let Ius restore to social intercourse that harmony and
affection, without which liberty, and even life itself, are but
dreary things; and let us reflect, that, having banished from
our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so
long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little, if we
countenance a political intolerance, as despotic, as wicked,
and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.
During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world;
during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking,
through blood and slaughter, his long lost liberty; it was
not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach
even this distant and peaceful shore; that this should be
more felt and feared by some, and less by others; and
should divide opinions, as to measures of safety.
But every difference of opinion is not a difference of
principle. We have called by different names bretliren of
the same principle. We are all republicans; we are all
319THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
federalists. If there be any among us who would wish to
dissolve this union, or to change its republican form, let
them stand undisturbed, as monuments of the safety with
which error of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is
left free to combat it.
I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican government cannot be strong; that this government is
not strong enough. But would the honest patriot, in the
full tide of successful experiment, abandon a government
which has so far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic and
visionary fear, that this government, the world's best hope,
may by possibility want energy to preserve itself? I trust
not; I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest government on earth.
I believe it the only one where every man, at the call of
the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and would
meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is said, that man cannot be trusted with
the government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with
the government of others? or have we found angels, in the
form of kings, to govern him?  Let history answer this
question.
Let us, then, with courage and confidence, pursue our
own federal and republicall principles; our attachment to
union and representative government. Kindly separated,
by nature and a wide ocean, from the exterminating havoc
of one quarter of the globe; too high mninded to endure the
degradations of the others; possessing a chosen country,
with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth
and thousandth generation; entertaining a due sense of our
equal right to the use of our own faculties; to the acquisitions of our own industry; to honour and confidence from
our fellow citizens.
Resulting not from birth, but from our actions, and their
sense of them; enlightened by a benign religion, professed,
indeed, and practised in various forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love
of man; acknowledging and adoring an overruling Providence, which, by all its dispensations, proves that it delights
in the happiness of mall here and his greater happiness
hereafter; with all these blessings, what more is necessary
to make us a happy and prosperous people.
320JEFFERSON-ELLIOTT.
Still one thing more, fellow citizens; a wise and frugal
government, which shall restrain men from injuring one
another; shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their
own pursuits of industry and improvement; and shall not
take from the mouth of labour the bread it has earned.
This is the sum of good government; and this is necessary
to close the circle of our felicities.  JEFFERSON.
131. -NATURE.
WHAT is there that will not be included in the history
of nature? The earth on which we tread, the air we
breathe, the waters around the earth, the material forms
that inhabit its surface, the mind of man, with all its magical illusions and all its inherent energy, the planets that
move around our system, the firmament of heaven, the
smallest of the invisible atoms which float around our globe,
and the most majestic of the orbs that roll through the immeasurable fields of peace; all are parts of one system,
productions of one power, creations of one intellect, the
offspring of Him by whom all that is inert and inorganic
in creation was formed, and from whom all that have life
derive their being.
Of this immense system, all that we can examine, this
little globe that we inherit is full of animation and crowded
with forms organized, glowing with life, and generally
sentient. No space is unoccupied; the exposed surface
of the rock is incrusted with living substances; plants
occupy the bark and decaying limbs of other plants; animals live on the surface and in the bodies of other animals;
inhabitants are fashioned and adapted to equatorial heats
and polar ice; air, earth, and ocean teem with life; and if
to other worlds the same proportion of life and of enjoyment has been distributed which has been allotted to ours;
if creative benevolence has equally filled every other planet
of every other system, nay, even the suns themselves, with
beings organized, animated, and intelligent, how countless
must be the generations of the living! what voices which
we cannot hear, what languages that we cannot understand,
what multitudes that we cannot see, may, as they roll along
321THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
the stream of time, be employed hourly, daily, and for ever,
in choral songs of praise, hymning their great Creator.
And when in this almost prodigal waste of life we perceive that every being, from the puny insect which flutters
in the evening ray, from the lichen which the eye can
scarcely distinguish on the mouldering rock; from the
fungus that springs up and reanimates the mass of dead and
decomposing substances, that every living form possesses
a structure as perfect in its sphere, an organization sometimes as complex, always as truly and completely adapted
to its purposes and modes of existence, as that of the most
perfect animal; when we discover them all to be governed
by laws as definite, as immutable,- as those which regulate
the planetary movements, great must be our admiration of
the wisdom which has arranged, and the power which has
perfected this stupendous fabric.
Nor does creation here cease. There are beyond the
limits of our system, beyond the visible forms of matter,
other principles, other powers, higher orders of beings, an
immaterial world which we cannot yet know; other modes
of existence which we cannot comprehend; yet, however
inscrutable to us, this spiritual world must be guided by its
own unerring laws, and the harmonious order which reigns

132.-EXTRACT FROM MR. M'DIJFFIE'S SPEECH ON CORRUPTION.
SIR,--We are apt to treat the idea of our own corruptibility
as utterly visionary, and to ask, with a grave affectation of
dignity, What! do you think a member of congress can be
corrupted? Sir, I speak what I have long alnd deliberately
considered, when I say, that since man was created, there
never has been a political body on the face of the earth,
that would not be corrupted under the same circumstances.
Corruption steals upon us in a thousand insidious forms,
when we are least aware of its approaches. Of all the forms
322in which it can present itself, the bribery of' office is the
most dangerous, because it assumes the guise of patriotism
to accomplish its fatal sorcery. We are often asked,
Where is the evidence of corruption?  Have you seen it?
Sir, do you expect to see it? You might as well expect
to see the imbodied forms of pestilence and famine stalking
before you, as to see the latent operations of this insidious
power. We may walk amid it and breathe its contagion,
without being conscious of its presence. All experience
teaches us the irresistible power of temptation, when vice
assumes the form of virtue.
The great enemy of mankind could not have consummated his infernal scheme for the seduction of our first
parents, but for the disguise in which he presented himself.
Had he appeared as the devil, in his proper form; had the
spear of Ithuriel disclosed the naked deformity of the fiend
of hell, the inhabitants of Paradise would have shrunk with
horror from his presence.
But he came as the insinuating serpent, and presented a
beautiful apple, the most delicious fruit in all the garden.
He.told his glowing story to the unsuspecting victim of his
guile. " It can be no crime to taste of this delightful fruit.
It will disclose to you the knowledge of good and evil. It
will raise you to an equality with the angels."
Such, sir, was the process; and in this simple but impressive narrative, we have the most beautiful and philosophical illustration of the frailty of man, and the power of
temptation, that could possibly be exhibited. Mr. Chairman, I have been forcibly struck with the similarity between
our present situation and that of Eve, after it was announced
that Satan was on the borders of Paradise.
We, too, have been warned that the enemy is on our
borders. But God forbid that the similitude should be
carried any further. Eve, conscious of her innocence,
sought temptation and defied it. The catastrophe is too
fatally known to us all. She went, " with the blessings of
Heaven on her head and its purity in her heart," guarded
by the ministry of angels; she returned, covered with
shame, under the heavy denunciation of Heaven's everlasting curse.
Sir, it is innocence that temptation conquers. If our
first parent, pure as she came from the hand of God, was

323THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
overcome by the seductive power, let us not imitate her
fatal rashness, seeking temptation, when it is in our power
to avoid it. Let us not vainly confide in our own infallibility. We are liable to be corrupted. To an ambitiouman, an honourable office will appear as beautiful and fascinating as the apple of Paradise.
I admit, sir, that ambition is a passion, at once the Imost
powerful and the most useful. Without it, human affairs
would become a mere stagnant pool. By means of his
patronage, the president addresses himself in the most irresistible manner, to this, the noblest and strongest of our
passions.
All that the imagination can desire, honour, power,
wealth, ease, are held out as the temptation. Man was not
made to resist such temptations. It is impossible to conceive, Satan himself could not devise a system which would
more infallibly introduce corruption and death into our
political Eden.  Sir, the angels fell from heaven with less
temptation.                                 M'DUFFIE.
133.--N THE MEASURE OF THE IRISI-I UNION.
SIR,-I in the most express terms deny the competency
of parliament to do this act. I warn you-do not dare to
lay your hand on the constitution. I tell you, that if
circumstanced as you are, you pass this act, it will be a
nullity, and that no man in Ireland will be bound to obey
it. I make the assertion deliberately; I repeat it, and call
on any man who hears me, to take down my words. You
have not been elected for this purpose; you are appointed
to make laws, not legislatures; you are appointed to exercise the functions of legislators, and not to transfer them;
and if you do so, your act is a dissolution of the government; you resolve society into its original elements, and
no mal in the land is bound to obey you.
Sir, I state doctrines which are not merely founded in
the immutable laws of justice and of truth; I state not
mnerely the opinions of the ablest men who have written
on the science of government; but I state the practice of
our constitution as settled at the era of the revolution; I
324state the doctrine under which the house of Hanover derives its title to the throne. Has the king a right to transfer his throne? Is he competent to annex it to the crown
of Spain, or of any other country? No, but he may abdicate it; and every man who knows the constitution, knows
the consequence, the right reverts to the next in succession; if they all abdicate, it reverts to the people.  rhe
man who questions this doctrine, in the same breath must
arraign the sovereign on the throne as a usurper. Are you
competent to transfer your legislative rights to the French
council of five hundred?  Are you competent to transfer
them to the British parliament?. I answer, No. When
you transfer you abdicate, and the great original trust reverts to the people from whom it issued. Yourselves you
may extinguish, but parliament you cannot extinguish: it
is enthroned in the hearts of the people; it is enshrined
in the sanctuary of the constitution; it is immortal as the
island which it protects; as well might the frantic suicide
hope that the act which destroys his miserable body,
should extinguish his eternal soul
Again I therefore warn you, do not dare to lay your
hands on the constitution; it is above your power. Sir,
I do not say that the parliament and the people, by mutual
consent and co-operation, may not change the form of the
constitution. Whenever such a case arises, it must be
decided on its own merits: but that is not this case. If
government considers this a season peculiarly fitted for
experiments on the constitution, they may call on the people. I ask you, Are you ready to do so? Are you ready
to abide the event of such an appeal? What is it you must
in that event submit to the people? Not this particular
project, for if you dissolve the present form of government, they become free to choose any other; you fling
them to the fury of the tempest; you must call on them
to unhouse themselves of the established constitution, and
to fashion to themselves another. I ask again, is this the
time for an experiment of that nature?
Thank God, the people have manifested no such wish;
so far as they have spoken, their voice is decidedly against
this daring innovation. You know that no voice has been
uttered in its favour, and you cannot be infatuated enough
to take confidence from tlle silence which prevails in some

parts of the kingdom; if you know how to appreciate
that silence, it is more formidable than the most clamorous opposition; you may be rived and shivered by the
lightning before you hear the peal of the thunder!
But, sir, we are told that we should discuss this question with calmness and composure! I am called on to
surrender my birth-right and my honour, and I am told I
should be calm, composed! National pride! Independence of our country! These, we are told by the minister, are only vulgar topics fitted for the meridian of the
mob, but unworthy to be mentioned to such an enlightened
assembly as this.'I'hey are trinkets and gewgaws, fit to
catch the fancy of childish and unthinking people like you,
sir, or like your predecessor in that chair, but utterly unworthy the consideration of this house, or of the matured understanding of the noble lord who condescends to instruct it.
Gracious God! we see a Perry reascending from the
tomb, and raising his awfuil voice to warn us against the
surrender of our freedom, and we see that the proud and
virtuous feelings which warmed the breast of that aged
and venerable man, are only calculated to excite the contempt of this young philosopher, who has been transplanted
from the nursery to the cabinet, to outrage the feelings
and understanding of the country.     PLUNKETT.
134.---SPEECH OF ROBERT EMMETT, AT THE CLOSE OF
HIS TRIAL FOR HIGH TREASON.
MY LORDs,-You ask me what I have to say, why sentence of death should not be pronounced on me according
to law? I have nothing to say, that can alter your predetermination, or that it will become me to say with any
view to the mitigation of that sentence, which you are
here to pronounce, and I must abide by. But I have that
to say which interests me more than life, and which you
have laboured to destroy. I have much to say why my
reputation should be rescued from the load of false accusation and calumny which has been heaped upon it.
I am charged with being an emissary of France. An
emissary of France! And for what end?  It is alleged,
that I wished to sell the independence of my country!
326And for what end? Was this the object of my ambition?
No; I am no emissary-my ambition was to hold a place
among the deliverers of my country-not in power, not
in profit, but in the glory of the achievement! Sell my
country's independence to France! and for what?  A
change of masters? No; but for ambition! 0, my
country, was it personal ambition that influenced me--had
it been the soul of my actions, could I not, by my education and fortune, by the rank and consideration of my
family, have placed myself among the proudest of your
oppressors? My country was my idol-to it I sacrificed
every selfish, every endearing sentiment, and for it I now
offer up my life. No, my lord, I acted as an Irishman,
determined on delivering my country from the yoke of a
foreign and unrelenting tyranny, and from the more galling
yoke of a domestic faction.
Connexion with France was indeed intended--but only
so far as mutual interest would sanction or require. Were
the French to assume any authority inconsistent with the
purest independence, it would be the signal of their destruction. Were they to come as invaders, or enemies
uninvited by the wishes of the people, I should oppose
them to the utmost of my strength. Yes, my countrymen, I should advise you to meet them on the beach, with
a sword in one hand and a torch in the other. I would
meet them with all the destructive fury of war, and I
would animate my countrymen to immolate them in their
boats, before they had contaminated the soil of my country. If' they succeeded in landing, and if forced to retire
before superior discipline, I would dispute every inch of
ground, raze every house, burn every blade of grass, and
the last intrenchment of liberty should be my grave.
I have been charged with that importance, in the efforts
to emancipate my country, as to be considered the keystone of the combination of Irishmen, or, as your lordship
expressed it, "the life and blood of the conspiracy."
You do me honour overmuch-you have given to the
subaltern all the credit of a superior; there are men engaged in this conspiracy, who are not only superior to
me, but even to your own conceptions of yourself, my
lord-men, before the splendour of whose genius and virtues I should bow with respectful deference, and who

Thus, then, said he, since you are so urgent, it is thus that I conceive

EXERCISES ON THE INTERROGATION, EXCLAMATION, AND.PARENTHESIS.
1. Would you do your homage the most agreeable way? would
you render the most acceptable of services? Offer unto God thanksgiving.
2. What shadow can be more vain than the life of a great part of
mankind? Of all that eager and bustling crowd we behold on earth,
how few discover the path of true happiness? How few can we find,
whose activity has not been misemployed, and whose course terminates
not in confessiorns of disappointments?
3. What are the scenes of nature that elevate the mind in the highest
degree, and produce the sublime sensation?  Not the gay landscape,
the flowery field, or the flourishing city; but the hoary mountain, and
the solitary lake; the aged forest, and the torrent falling over the
rock.
4. Is there any one who will seriously maintain, that the taste of a
Hottentot or a Laplander is as delicate and as correct as that of a
Longinus or an Addison? or, that he can be charged with no defect or
incapacity, who thinks a common news-writer as excellent an historian
as Tacitus?
5. That strong, hyperbolical manner which we have long been accustomed to call the Oriental manner of poetry (because some of the
earliest poetical productions came to us from the east) is in truth no
more Oriental than Occidental; it is characteristical of an age rather
than of a country; and belongs, in some measure, to all nations at that
period which first gives rise to music and to song.

would think themselves dishonoured to be called your
friends--who would not disgrace themselves by shaking
your blood-stained hand.--[Here he was interrupted.]
What, my lord, shall you tell me, on the passage to
that scaffold, which that tyranny, of which you are only
the intermediate executioner, has erected for my murder,
that I am accountable for all the blood that has been and
will be shed in this struggle of the oppressed against the
oppressor-shall you tell me this, and must I be so very a
slave as not to repel it? I, who fear not to approach the
Omnipotent Judge, to answer for the conduct of my whole
life--am I to be appalled and falsified by a mere remnant
of mortality here-by you, too, who, if it were possible
to collect all the innocent blood that you have shed, in
your unhallowed ministry, in one great reservoir, your
lordship might swim in it?
My lords, you seem impatient for the sacrifice-the
blood for which you thirst is not congealed by the artificial terrors which surround your victim; it circulates
warmly and unruffled through the channels which God
created for noble purposes, but which you are bent to destroy for purposes so grievous, that' they cry to Heaven.
Be yet patient! I have but a few more words to say. I
am going to my cold and silent grave: my lamp of life is
nearly extinguished: my race is run: the grave opens to
receive me, and I sink into its bosom. I have but one
request to ask at my departure from this world: it is the
charity of its silence. Let no man write my epitaph; for
as no man who knows my motives, dare now vindicate
them, let not prejudice or ignorance asperse them. Let
them and me repose in obscurity, and my tomb remain
uninscribed, until other times and other men can do justice
to my character. When my country takes her place
among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let
my epitaph be written.--I have done!   EMMETT.
135.-RIGHT OF DISCOVERY.
THE first source of right, by which property is acquired
in a country, is discovery. For as all mankind have an
equal right to any thing which has never before been
328appropriated, so any nation that discovers an uninhabited
country, and takes possession thereof, is considered as
enjoying full property, and absolute, unquestionable empire therein.
This proposition being admitted, it follows clearly, that
the Europeans who first visited America were the real
discoverers of the same; nothing being necessary to the
establishment of this fact, but simply to prove that it was
totally uninhabited by man. This would at first appear to
be a point of some difficulty: for it is well known, that
this quarter of the world abounded with certain animals,
that walked erect on two feet, had something of the human
countenance, uttered certain unintelligible sounds, very
much like language; in short, had a marvellous resemblance to human beings.:But the zealous and enlightened fathers, who accompanied the discoverers, for the purpose of promoting the
kingdom of heaven by establishing fat monasteries anld
bishoprics on earth, soon cleared up this point, greatly to
the satisfaction of his holiness the pope, and of all Christian voyagers and discoverers.
They plainly proved, and as there were no Indian
writers to take the other side, the fact was considered as
fully admitted and established, that the two legged race of
animals before mentioned, were mere cannibals, detestable
monsters, and many of them giants-which last description
of vagrants have, since the time of Gog, Magog and Goliath, been considered as outlaws, and have received no
quarter in either history, chivalry or song. Indeed, even
the philosophic Bacon declared the Americans to be people
proscribed by the laws of nature, inasmuch as they had a
barbarous custom  of sacrificing men, and feeding upon
man's flesh. But the benevolent fathers, who had undertaken to turn these unhappy savages into dumb beasts, by
dint of argument, advanced still stronger proofs; for, as
certain divines of the sixteenth century, and among the
rest Lullus, affirm, the Americans go naked, and have no
beards!-" They have nothing," says Lullus, " of the
reasonable animal, except the mask."-And even that
mask was allowed to avail them but little: for it was soon
found that they were of a hideous copper complexion, it
was all the same as if they were negroes-and negroes are

black; " and black," said thle pious fathers, devoutly cross
ing themselves, " is the colour of the devil!"  Therefore,
so far from being able to own property, they had no right
even to personal freedom--for liberty is too radiant a deity
to inhabit such gloomy temples. All which circumstances
plainly convinced the righteous followers of Cortes and
Pizarro, that these miscreants had no title to the soil that
they infested-that they were a perverse, illiterate, dumb,
beardless, black seed-mere wild beasts of the forest, and
like them should either be subdued or exterminated.
IRVING.
136.-RIGHT OF CULTIVATION.
THE right of discovery being fully established, we now
come to the next, which is the right acquired by cultivation. " The cultivation of the soil," we are told, "' is an
obligation imposed by nature on mankind. The whole
world is appointed for the nourishment of its inhabitants:
but it would be incapable of doing it, was it uncultivated.
Every nation is then obliged, by the law of nature, to cultivate the ground that has fallen to its share. Those people,
like the ancient Germans and modern Tartars, who, having
fertile countries, disdain to cultivate the earth, and choose
to live by rapine, are wanting to themselves, and deserve to
be exterminatecl, as savages and pernicious beasts.
Now it is notorious, that the savages knew nothing of
agriculture when first discovered by the Europeans, but
lived a most vagabond, disorderly, unrighteous life,rambling from place to place, and prodigally rioting upon
the spontaneous luxuries of nature, without tasking her
generosity to yield them any thing more; whereas it has
been most unquestionably shown, that Heaven intended
the earth should be ploughed, and sown, and manured, and
laid out into cities, and towns, and farms, and country seats,
and pleasure grounds, and public gardens, all which the
Indians knew nothing about,-therefore, they did not innprove the talents Providence had bestowed on them,therefore, they were careless stewards,-therefore, they
hlad no right to the soil,-therefore, they deserved to be
exterminated.
330It is true, the savages might plead that they drew all the
benefits from the land which their simple wants requiredthey found plenty of game to hunt, which, together with
the roots and uncultivated fruits of the earth, furnished a
sufficient variety for their frugal repasts;-and that as
Heaven merely designed the earth to form the abode and
satisfy the wants of man, so long as those purposes were
answered, the will of Heaven was accomplished. But
this only proved how undeserving they were of the blessings around them--they were so much the more savages,
for not having more wants; for knowledge is in some degree an increase of desires; and it is this superiority both
in the number and magnitude of his desires, that distinguishes the man from the beast.'I'herefore, the Indians,
in not having more wants, were very unreasonable animals:
and it was but just, that they should make way for the
Europeans, who had a thousand wants to their one; and,
therefore, would turn the earth to more account, and by
cultivating it, more truly fulfil the will of Heaven.
Besides-Grotius, and Lauterbach, and Puffendorff, and
Titus, and many wise men beside, who have considered
the matter properly, have determined, that the property of
a country cannot be acquired by hunting, cutting wood or
drawing water in it,--Nothing but precise demarkation of
limits, and the intention of cultivation, can establish the
possession  Now, as tl-he savages (probably from never
having read the authors above quoted) had never complied
with any of these necessary forms, it plainly followed
that they had no right to the soil, but that it was completely at the disposal of the first comers, who had more
knowledge, more wants, and more elegant, that is to say,
artificial desires than themselves.:
In entering upon a newly discovered, uncultivated country, therefore, the new comers were but taking possession
of what, according to the aforesaid doctrine, was their own
property,-therefore, in opposing them, the savages were
invading their just rights, infringing the immutable laws
of nature, and counteracting the will of Heaven,-therefore, they were guilty of impiety burglary, and trespass
on the case,-therefore, they were hardened offenders
against -God and man,-therefore, they ought to be exterm in iated.                                   IRVING.

IRVING.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
137.-MR. CLAY'S SPEECH ON OCCASION OF INTRODUCING
HIS PUBLIC LANDS BILL.
MR. PRESIDENT,-Although I find myself borne down
by the severest affliction with which Providence has ever
been pleased to visit me, I have thought that my private
griefs ought not longer to prevent me from attempting, ill
as I feel qualified, to discharge my public duties. And I
now rise, in pursuance of the notice which has been giv.en,
to ask leave to introduce a bill to appropriate, for a limited
time, the proceeds of the sales of the public lands of the
United States, and for granting land to certain states.
I feel it incumbent on me to make a brief explanation
of the highly important measure which I have now the
honour to propose. Trlhe bill which I desire to introd(uce,
provides for the distribution of the proceeds of the public
lands in the years 1833, 1834, 1835, 1836 and 1837,
among the twenty-four states of the union, and conforms
substantially to that which passed in 1833. It is therefore
of a temporary character; but if it shall be found to have
salutary operation, it will be in the power of a future congress to give it an indefinite continuance; and, if otherwise, it will expire by its own terms. In the event of war
unfortunately breaking out with any foreign power, the bill
is to cease, and the fund which it distributes is to be applied to the prosecution of the war. The bill directs that ten
per cent. of the net proceeds of the public lands sold within the limits of the seven new states, shall be first set apart
for them, in addition to the five per cent. reserved by their
several compacts with the United States; and that the
residue of the proceeds, whether from sales made in the
states or territories, shall be divided among the twentyfour states, in proportion to their respective federal population. In this respect the bill conforms to that which was
introduced in 1832. For one, I should have been willing
to have allowed the new states twelve and a half instead of
ten per cent.; but as that was objected to by the president,
in his veto message, and has been opposed in other quar
ters, I thought it best to restrict the allowance to the more
moderate sum. The bill also contains large and liberal
grants of land to several of the new states, to place them
332upon an equality with others to which the bounty of con
gress has been heretofore extended, and provides that,
when other new states shall be admitted into the union,
they shall receive their share of the common filnd.
Mr. President, I have ever regarded,-with feelings of the
profoundest regret, the decision which the president of the
United States felt himself induced to make on the bill of
1833. If the bill had passed, about twenty millions of
dollars would have been, during the last three years, in the
hands of the several states, applicable by them to the beneficent purposes of internal improvement, education or
colonizationi. What immense benefits might not have been
diffused throughout the land by the active employment of
that large sum?  What new channels of commerce and
communication might not have been opened?    What
industry stimulated, what labour rewarded?  How many
youthful minds might have received the blessings of edu
cation and knowledge, and been rescued from ignorance,
vice, and ruin? How many descendants of Africa might
have been transported from a country where they never can
enjoy political or social equality, to the native land of
their fathers, where no impediment exists to their attainment of the highest degree of elevation, intellectual, social
and political! where they might have been successful
instruments, in the hands of God, to spread the religion
of his Son, and to lay the foundation of civil liberty.
But, although we have lost three precious years, the
secretary of the treasury tells us that the principal of this
vast sum is yet safe; and much good may still be achieved
with it. The spirit of improvement pervades the land
in every variety of form, active, vigorous and enterprising,
wanting pecuniary aid as well as intelligent direction. The
states are strengthening the union by various lines of
communication thrown across and through the mountains.
New York has completed one great chain. Pennsylvania
another, bolder in conception and more arduous in the execution. Virginia has a similar work in progress, worthy
of all her enterprise and energy. A fourth, further south
where the parts of the union are too loosely connected, has
been projected, and it can certainly be executed with tho
supplies which this bill affords, and perhaps not withot.
them.
333
CLAY.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
This bill passed, and these and other similar undertakings completed, we may indulge the patriotic hope that
our union will be bound by ties and interests that render it
indissoluble. Asthe general government withholds all direct
agency from these truly national works, and from all new
objects of internal improvement, ought it not to yield to the
states, what is their own, the amount received from the
public lands?  It would thus but execute faithfully a trust
expressly created by the original deeds of cession, or resulting from the treaties of acquisition.  With this ample
resource, every desirable object of improvement, in every
part of our extensive country, may in due time be accomplished.-Placing this exhaustless fund in the hands of
the several members of the confederacy, their common
federal head may address them in the glowing language of
the British bard, and,
Bid harbours open, public ways extend,
Bid temples worthier of the God ascend.
Bid the broad arch the dangerous flood contain,
The mole projecting break the roaring main.
Back to his bounds their subject sea command,
And roll obedient rivers through the land.
I confess I feel anxious for the fate of this measure, less
on account of any agency I have had in proposing it, as I
hope and believe, than from a firm, sincere and thorough
conviction, that no one measure ever presented to the
councils of the nation, was fraught with so much unmixed
good, and could exert such powerful and enduring-influence
in the preservation of the union itself and upon some of
its highest interests. If I can be instrumental, in any
degree, in the adoption of it, I shall enjoy, in that retirement into which I hope shortly to enter, a heart-feeling
satisfaction and a lasting consolation. I shall carry there
no regrets, no complaints, no reproaches on my own account.  When I look back upon my humble origin, left an
orphan too young to have been conscious of a father's
smiles and caresses; with a widowed mother, surrounded
by a numerous offspring, in the midst of pecuniary embarrassments; without a regular education, without fortune,
without friends, without patrons, I have reason to be satisfied with my public career. I ought to be thankful for the
high places and honours to which I have been called by the

favour and partiality of my countrymen, and I am thankful and grateful. And I shall take with me the pleasing
consciousness that in whatever station I have been placed,
I have earnestly and honestly laboured to justify their confidence by a faithful, fearless and zealous discharge of my
public duties. Pardon these personal allusions.  CLAY.
138.-EXTRACT FROM SIR JAMES M'INTOSH'S SPEECH ON
THE TRIAL OF M. PELTIER.
GENTLEMEN,-I must entreat you to bear with me for a
short time to allow me to suppose a case which might have
occurred, in which you will see the horrible consequences
of enforcing rigorously principles of law, which I cannot
counteract, against political writers. We might have been
at peace with France during the whole of that terrible period
which elapsed between August 1792 and 1794, which has
been usually called the reign of Robespierre! The only
series of crimes, perhaps, in history, which, in spite of the
common disposition to exaggerate extraordinary facts, has
been beyond measure underrated in public opinion. I say
this, gentlemen, after an investigation, which I think entitles
me to affirm it with confidence. Men's minds were oppressed by atrocity and the multitude of crimes; their
humanity and their indolence took refuge in skepticism
from such an overwhelming mass of guilt; and the consequence was, that all these unparalleled enormities, though
proved not only with the fullest historical, but with the
strictest judicial evidence, were at the time only half
believed, and are now scarcely half remembered. When
these atrocities were daily perpetrating, of which the greatest
part are as little known to the public in general as the campaigns of Genghis Khan, but are still protected from the
scrutiny of men by the immensity of thc.se voluminous
records of guilt in which they are related, and under the
mass of which they will be buried, till some historian be
found with patience and courage enough to drag them forth
into light, for the shame indeed, but for the instruction of
mankind. When these crimes were perpetrating, which
had the peculiar malignity, from the pretexts with which
they were covered, of making the noblest objects of human.,35TIIE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
pursuit seem odious and detestable; which have almos
mnade the names of liberty, reformation, and humanity
synonymous with anarchy, robbery, and murder; which
thus threatened not only to extinguish every principle of
improvement, to arrest the progress of civilized society,
and to disinherit future generations of that rich succession
which they were entitled to expect from the knowledge
and wisdom of the present, but to destroy the civilization
of Europe, which never gave such a proof of its vigor and
robustness, as in being able to resist their destructive
power; when all these horrors were acting in the greatest
empire of the continent, I will ask my learned friend, if
we had then been at peace with France, how'English
writers were to relate them so as to escape the charge of
libelling a friendly government?
When Robespierre, in the debates in the national convention on the mode of' murdering their blameless sovereign,
objected to the formal and tedious mode of murder called a
trial, and proposed to put him immediately to death, "' on
the principles of insurrection," because to doubt the guilt
of the king would be to doubt of the innocence of the convention; and if the king were not a traitor, the convention
must be rebels; would my learned friend have had an
English writer state all this with " decorumn and moderation?"  Would he have had an English writer state,'that
though this reasoning was not perfectly agreeable to our
national laws, or perhaps to our national prejudices, yet it
was not for him to make any observations on the judicial
proceedings of foreign states?
When Marat, in the same convention, called for two
hlundred and seventy thousand heads, must our English
writers have said, that the remedy did, indeed, seem to
their weak judgment rather severe; but that it was not for
them to judge the conduct of so illustrious an assembly as
the national convention, or the suggestions of so enlightened
a statesman as M. Marat?
When that convention resounded with applause at the
news of several hundred aged priests being thrown into
the Loire, and particularly at the exclamation of Carrier,
who communicated the intelligence, " What a revolutionary
torrent is the Loire!" when these suggestions and narrations of murder, which have hitherto been only hinted and
336wshispered in the most secret cabals, in the darkest caverns
of banditti, were triumphantly uttered, patiently endured,
and even loudly applauded by an assembly of seven hundred men, acting in the sight of all Europe, would my
learned friend have wished that there had been found in
England a single writer so base as to deliberate upon the
most safe, decorous, and polite manner of relating all these
things to his countrymen?
When Carrier ordered five hundred children under fourteen years of age to be shot, the greater part of whom
escaped the fire firom their size, when the poor victims ran
for protection to the soldiers and were'bayoneted clinging
round their knees! would my friend-but I cannot pursue
the strain of interrogation. It is too much. It would be a
violence which I cannot practise on my own feelings. It
would be an outrage to my friend. It would be an insult
to humanity. No! Better, tell thousand times better,
would it be that every press in the world were burnt, that
the very use of letters were abolished, that we were turned
to the honest ignorance of the rudest times, than that the
results of civilization should be made subservient to the
purposes of barbarism, than that literature should be employed to teach a toleration for cruelty, to weaken moral
hatred for guilt, to deprave and brutalize the human mind.
I know that I speak my friend's feelings as well as my
own, when I say, God forbid that the dread of any punishment should ever make an Englishman an accomplice in
so corrupting his countrymen, a public teacher of depravity
and barbarity!
Mortifying and horrible as the idea is, I must remind you,
gentlemen, that even at that time, even under the reign of
Robespierre, my learned friend, if he had then been attorney-general, might have been compelled by some most
deplorable necessity, to have come into this court to ask
your verdict against the libellers of Barrere and Collot
d'Herbois. Mr. Peltier then employed his talents against
the enemies of the human race, as he has uniformly an'
bravely done. I do not believe that any peace, any political considerations, any fear of punishment, would have
silenced him. He has shown too much honour, and constancy, and intrepidity, to be shaken by such circumstance.s
as these.

32THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
My learned friend might then have been compelled to
have filed a criminal information against Mr. Peltier, for
" wickedly and maliciously intending to vilify and degrade
Maximilian Robespierre, president of the committee of
public safety of the French republic!" He might have
been reduced to the sad necessity of appearing before you,
to bely his own better feelings; to prosecute Mr. Peltier
for publishing those sentiments which my friend himself
had a thousand times felt, and a thousand times expressed.
He might have been obliged even to call for punishment
upon Mr. Peltier for language which he and all mankind
would for ever despise Mr. Peltier if he were not to employ.
Then indeed, gentlemen, we should have seen the last humiliation fall on England; the tribunals, the spotless and
venerable tribunals of this free country, reduced to be the
ministers of the vengeance of Robespierre! What could
1have rescued us from this last disgrace? The honesty and
courage of a jury. They would have delivered the judges
of this country from the dire necessity of inflicting punishment on a brave and virtuous man, because he spoke truth
of a monster. They would have despised the threats of a
foreign tyrant, as their ancestors braved the power of oppression at home.
In the court where we are now met, Cromwell twice
sent a satirist on his tyranny to be convicted and punished
as a libeller; and in this court, almost in sight of the scaffold streaming with the blood of his sovereign, within
hearing of the clash of his bayonets which drove out parliament with contumely, two successive juries rescued the
intrepid satirist from his fangs, and sent out with defeat and
disgrace the usurper's attorney-general from what he had
the insolence to call his court. Even then, gentlemen,
when all law and liberty were trampled under the feet of a
military banditti; when those great crimes were perpetrated
in a high place and with a high hand against those who
were the objects of public veneration, which, more than
any thing else, break their spirits and confound their moral
sentiments, obliterate the distinctions between right and
wrong in their understanding, and teach the mnultitude to
feel no longer any reverence for that justice which they
tihus see triumphantly dragged at the chariot-wheels of a'yrant; even then, when this unhappy country, triumphant
338M'INTOS I-o--PIIILLIPS.
indeed abroad but enslave(d at home, had no prospect but
that of a long ~uccession of' tyrants wading through slaughter to a throne-even then, I say, when all seemed lost, the
unconquerable spirit of English liberty survived in the
hearts of English jurors. That spirit is, I trust in God,
not extinct; and if any modern tyrant were, in the drunkenness of his iiisolence, to hope to overawe an English jury,
I trust and I believe that they would tell him: " Our
ancestors braved the bayonets of Cromwell; we bid defiance to yours. Contempsi Catalint gladios-non pertimescam tuos 1"
What could be such a tyrant's means of overawing a
jury? As long as their country exists, they are girt round
with impenetrable armour. Till the destruction of their
country no danger call fall upon them for the performance
of their duty, and I do trust that there is no Englishman so
unworthy of life as to desire to outlive England.  But if
any of us are condemned to the cruel punishment. of surviving our country--if, in the inscrutable counsels of Providence, this favoured seat of justice and liberty, this noblest
work of human wisdom and virtue, be destined, to destruction, which I -shall not be charged with national prejudice
for saying would be the most dangerous wound ever inflicted on civilization; at least let us carry with us into our
sad exile the colsolation that we ourselves have not violated
the rights of hospitality to exiles--that we hlave not torn
from the altar the suppliant who claimed protection as the
voluntary victim of loyalty and conscience!
Gentlemen, I now leave this unfortunate gentleman in
your hands. His character and his situation might interest
your humanity; but, on his behalf, I only ask justice from
you. I only ask a favourable construction of what cannot
be said to be more than ambiguous language, and this you
will soon be told from the highest authority is a part of
justice.

this world's wisdom, secure to empire the permanency
of its possessions? Alas! Troy thought so once; yet
the land of Priam lives only in song! Thebes thought so
once; yet her hundred gates have crumbled, and her very
tombs are but as the dust they were vainly intended to
commemorate! So thoulght Palmyra-where is she? So
thought the countries of Demosthenes and the Spartan; yet
Leonidas is trampled by the timid slave, and Athens insulted by the servile, mindless and enervate Ottoman! In
his hurried march, time has but looked at their imagined
immortality; and all its vanities, from the palace to the
tomb, have, with their ruins, erased the very impression of
his footsteps! The days of their glory are as if they had
never been; and the island that was then a speck, rude and
neglected in the barren ocean, now rivals the ubiquity of
their commerce, the glory of their arms, the fame of their
philosophy, the eloquence of their senate, and the inspiration of their bards! Who shall say, then, contemplating
the past, that England, proud and potent as she appears,
may not, one day, be what Athens is, and the young America yet soar to be what Athens was! Who shall say,
that, when the European column shall have mouldered,
and the night of barbarism obscured its very ruins, that
mighty continent may not emerge from the horizon to rule,
for its time, sovereign of the ascendant!  PHILLIPS.
140.--SPEECH ON THE CATHOLIC QUESTION.
WHERE, I ask, where are those Protestant petitions
against the Catholic claims, which we were told would
by this time have borne down your table? We were told
in the confident tone of prophecy, that England would have
poured in petitions from all her counties, towns and corporations, against the claims of Ireland. I ask, where are
those petitions? Has London, her mighty capital, has the
university of Dublin, mocked the calamities of your country, by petitioning in favour of those prejudices that would
render us less able to redress them? Have the people of
England raised a voice against their Catholic fellow subjects? No; they have the wisdom to see the folly of
robbing the empire, at such a time, of one-fourth of its
340strength, on account of speculative doctrines of faith. They
will not risk a kingdom on account of old men's dreams
about the prevalence of the pope. They will not sacrifice
an empire because they dislike the sacrifice of the mass.
I say, then, England is not against us. She has put ten
thousand signatures upon your table in our favour. And
what says the Protestant interest in Ireland! Look at their
petition-examine the names-the houses-the families.
Look at the list of merchants-of divines. Look, in a
word, at Protestant Ireland, calling to you in a warning
voice-telling you that if you are resolved to go on, till
ruin breaks with a fearful surprise upon your progress,
they will go on with you-they must partake your danger,
though they will not share your guilt.
Ireland, with her imperial crown, now stands before you.
You have taken her parliament from her, and she appears
in her own person at your bar. Will you dismiss a kingdom without a hearing? Is this your answer to her zeal, to
her faith, to the blood that has so profusely graced your
march to victory-to the treasures that have decked your
strength in peace. Is her name nothing-her fate indifferent-are her contributions insignificant--her six millions
revenue-her ten millions trade-her two millions absentee
-her four millions loan? Is such a country not worth a
hearing? Will you, can you dismiss her abruptly from
your bar? You cannot do it--the instinct of England is
against it. We may be outnumbered now and again-but
in calculating the amount of the real sentiments of the
people-the ciphers that swell the evanescent majorities
of an evanescent minister, go for nothing.
Can Ireland forget the memorable era of 1788? Can
others forget the munificent hospitality with which she
then freely gave to her chosen hope all that she had to give?
Can Ireland forget the spontaneous and glowing cordiality
with which her favours were then received? Never!
Never! Irishmen grew justly proud in the consciousness
of being subjects of a gracious predilection-a predilectior
that required no apology, and called for no renunciationa predilection that did equal honour to him who felt it, and
to those who were the objects of it. It laid the grounds
of a great and fervent hope-all a nation's wishes crowding to a point, and looking forward to one event, as the

great coming, at whicll every wound was to be healed,
every tear to be wiped away. The nrope of that hour
beamned with a cheering warmth and a seductive brilliancy.
Ireland followed it with all her heart-a leading light
through the wilderness, and brighter in its gloom. She
followed it over a wide and barren waste: it has charmed
her through the desert, and now, that it has led her to the
confines of light and darkness, now, that she is on the
borders of the promised land, is the prospect to be suddenly obscured, and the fair vision of princely faith to
vanish for ever!-I will not believe it-I require an act of
parliament to vouch its credibility--nay more, I demand a
miracle to convince me that it is possible!  GRATTAN.
141.-THE PATRIOT'S HOPE.
SIR,-Our republic has long been a theme of speculation
among the savans of Europe. They profess to have cast
its horoscope, and fifty years was fixed upon by many as
the utmost limit-of its duration. But those years passed
by, and beheld us a united and happy people; our political
atmosphere, agitated by no storm, and scarce a cloud to
obscure the serenity of our horizon; all of the present
was prosperity; all of the future, hope.---True, upon the
day of that anniversary two venerated fathers of our freedom and of our country fell; but they sunk calmly to rest,
in the maturity of years and in the fulness of time; and
their simultaneous departure on that day of jubilee, for
-another and a better world, was hailed by our nation as a
propitious sign, sent to us from heaven. Wandering the
other day in the alcoves of the library, I accidentally
opened a volume containing the orations delivered by many
distinguished men on that solemn occasion, and I noted
some expressions of a few who now sit in this hall, which
are deep fraught with the then prevailing, I may say universal feeling. It is inquired by one, " Is this the effect
of accident or blind chance, or has that God, who holds in
his hand the destiny of nations and of men, designed these
things as an evidence of the permanence and perpetuity
of our institutions?"  Another says, " Is it not stamped
with the seal of divinity?"  And a third, descanting on0
342the prospects, bright and glorious. which opened on our
beloved country, says, " Auspicious omens cheer us."
Yet it would have required but a tinge of superstitious
gloom, to have drawn from that event darker forebodings
of that which was to come. In our primitive wilds, where
the order of nature is unbroken by the hand of man;
there, where majestic trees arise, spread forth their branches, live out their age, and decline; sometimes will a patriarchal plant, which has stood for centuries the winds and
stormls, fall when no breeze agitates a leaf of the trees
that *surround it. And when, in the calm stillness of a
summer's noon, the solitary woodsman hears on either
hand the heavy crash of huge, branchless trunks, falling by
their own weight to the earth whence thev sprung, prescient
of the future, he foresees the whirlwind at hand, which
shall sweep through the forest, break its strongest stems,
upturn its deepest roots, and strew in the dust its tallest,
proudest heads. But I am none of those who indulge in
gloomy anticipation. I do not despair of the republic.
My trust is strong, that the gallant ship, in which all our
hopes are embarked, will yet outride the storm; saved
alike from the breakers and billows of disunion, and the
greedy whirlpool--the all-ingulfing maelstroom of executive power, that unbroken, if not unharmed, she may pursue her. prosperous voyage far down the stream of time;
and that the banner of our country, which now waves over
us so proudly, will still float in triumph--borne on the
wings of heaven, fanned by the breath of fame, every
stripe, bright and unsullied, every star fixed in its sphere,
ages after each of us now here shall have ceased to gaze
on its majestic folds for ever.               EWING.
142.-CHARACTER OF TRUE ELOQUENCE.
WHEN public bodies are to be addressed on momentous
occasions, when great interests are at stake, and strong
passions excited, nothing is valuable, in speech, farther
than it is connected with high intellectual and moral endowments. Clearness, force, and earnestness, are the qualities
which produce conviction. True eloquence, indeed, does
not consist in speech. It cannot be, brought from far.
343'
EWING--WEBSTER.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Labour and learning may toil for it, but they will toil in
vain. Words and phrases may be marshalled in every way,
but they cannot compass it. It must exist in the man,
in the subject, and in the occasion. Affected passion,
intense expression, the pomp of declamation, all may aspire
after it-they cannot reach it. It comes, if it come at all,
like the outbreaking of a fountain from the earth, or the
bursting forth of volcanic fires, with spontaneous, original,
native force. The graces taught in the schools, the costly
ornaments, and studied contrivances of speech, shock and
disgust men, when their own lives, and the fate of their
wives, their children, and their country, hang on the decision of the hour.'rhen, words have lost their power,
rhetoric is vain, and all elaborate oratory contemptible.
Even genius itself then feels rebuked and subdued, as in
the presence of higher qualities.'I'hen, patriotism  is
eloquent; then, self-devotion is eloquent. The clear conception, outrunning the deductions of logic, the high purpose, the firm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speaking on the
tongue, beaming from the eye, informing every feature,
and urging the whole man onward, right onward to his
object-this, this is eloquence: or rather it is something
greater and higher than all eloquence,--it is action, noble,
sublime, godlike action.                    WEBSTER.
143.-THE BEST OF CLASSICS.
THERE is a classic, the best the world has ever seen, the
noblest that has ever honoured and dignified the language
of mortals. If we look into its antiquity, we discover a
title to our veneration, unrivalled in the history of literature. If we have respect to its evidences, they are found
in the testimony of miracle and prophecy; in the ministry
of man, of nature and of angels, yea, even of " God, manifest in the flesh," of " God, blessed for ever."  If we
consider its authenticity, no other pages have survived the
lapse of time, that can be compared with it. If we examine
its authority, for it speaks as never man spake, we discover,
that it came from heaven, in vision and prophecy, under
the sanction of Him, who is Creator of all things, and the
Giver of every good and perfect gift. If we reflect on its
truths, they are lovely and spotless, sublime and holy, as
344GRIMKE-MONTGOMERY.
God himself, unchangeable as his nature, durable as his
righteous dominion, and versatile as the moral condition of
mankind. If we regard the value of its treasures, we must
estimate them, not like the relics of classic antiquity, by
the perishable glory and beauty, virtue and happiness of
this world, but by the enduring perfection and supreme
felicity of an eternal kingdom. If we inquire, who are the
men that have recorded its truths, vindicated its rights,
and illustrated the excellence of its scheme-from the depth
of ages and from the living world, from the populous continent and the isles of the sea-comes forth the answerthe patriarch and the prophet, the evangelist and the martyr.
If we look abroad through the world of men, the victims
of folly or vice, the prey of cruelty, or injustice, and
inquire what are its benefits, even in this temporal state,
the great and the humble, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the learned and the ignorant reply, as
with one voice, that humility and resignation, purity, order
and peace, faith, hope and charity, are its blessings upon
earth. And if, raising our eyes from timle to eternity, from
the world of mortals to the world of just men made perfect,
from the visible creation, marvellous, beautiful and glorious
as it is, to the invisible creation of angels and seraphs,
from the footstool of God, to the throne of God himself,
we ask, what are thle blessings that flow from this single
volume, let the question be answered by the pen of the
evangelist, the harp of the prophet, and the records of the
book of life.
Such is the best of classics the world has ever admired,
such, the noblest that man has ever adopted as a guide.

Touch'd by remembrance, trembles to that pole:
For in this land of heaven's peculiar grace,
The heritage of nature's noblest race,
There is a spot of earth supremely blest,
A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest,
Where man, creation's tyrant, casts aside
His sword and sceptre, pageantry and pride,
While, in his soften'd looks, benignly blend
The sire, the son, the husband, father, friend.
Here woman reigns; the mother, daughter, wife,
Strews with fresh flowers the narrow way of life;
In the clear heaven of her delightful eye,
An angel-guard of loves and graces lie;
Around her knees domestic duties meet,
And fireside pleasures gambol at her feet.

Art thou a man? a patriot? look around;
O! thou shalt find, howe'er thy footsteps roam,
That land thy country, and that spot thy home.

145.-NO EXCELLENCE WITHOU'T LABOUR.
THE education, gentlemen, moral and intellectual, of every
individual, must be, chiefly, his own work. Rely upon
it, that the ancients were right--Quisque sue fortune
faber-both in morals and intellect, we give their final
shape to our own characters, and thus become, emphatically, the architects of our own fortunes. How else
could it happen, that young men, who have had precisely
the same opportunities, should be continually presenting
us with such different results, and rushing to such opposite
destinies? Difference of talent will not solve it, because
that difference is very often in favour of the disappointed
candidate. You shall see issuing from the walls of the
same college-nay, sometimes from the bosom of the same
family-two young men, of whom the one shall be admitted to be a genius of high order, the other, scarcely above

while on the other hand, you shall observe the mediocre
plodding his slow but sure way up the hill of life, gaining
steadfast footing at every step, and mounting, at length, to
eminence and distinction, an ornament to his family, a
blessing to his country. Now, whose work is this?
Manifestly their own. They are the architects of their
respective fortunes. The best seminary of learning that
can open its portals to you, can do no more than to afford
you the opportunity of instruction: but it must depend, at
last, on yourselves, whether you will be instructed or not,
or to what point you will push your instruction. And of
this be assured-I speak, from observation, a certain truth:
there is no excellence without great labour. It is the fiat
of fate from which no power of genius can absolve you.
Genius, unexerted, is like the poor moth that flutters
around a candle till it scorches itself to death. If genius
be desirable at all, it is only of that great and magnanimous
kind, which, like the condor of South America, pitches
from the summit of Chimborazo, above the clouds, and
sustains itself, at pleasure, in that empyreal region, with
an energy rather invigorated than weakened by the effort.
It is this capacity for high and long continued exertionthis vigorous power of profound and searching investigation-this careering and wide spreading comprehension oi
mind-and those long reaches of thought, that

of committing an unlawful deed?  Why does the very
murderer, his victim sleeping before him, and his glaring
eye, taking the measure of the, blow, strike wide of the
mortal part? Because of conscience!'Twas that made
Caesar pause upon the brink of the Rubicon. Compassion! What compassion! The compassion of an assassin, that feels a momentary shudder, as his weapon begins
to cut! Caesar paused upon the brink of the Rubicon!
What was the Rubicon? The boundary of Caesar's province. From what did it separate his province? From
his country. Was that country a desert? No; it was
cultivated and fertile; rich and populous! Its sons were
men of genius, spirit, and generosity! Its daughters were
lovely, susceptible, and chaste! Friendship was its inhabitant! Love was its inhabitant! Domestic affection
was its inhabitant!  Liberty was its inhabitant! All
bounded by the stream of the Rubicon! What was Caesar, that stood upon the bank of that stream? A traitor,
bringing war and pestilence into the heart of that country!
No wonder that he paused-no wonder if, his imagination
wrought upon by his conscience, he had beheld blood
instead of water; and heard groans, instead of murmurs!
No wonder, if some gorgon horror had turned him into stone
upon the spot! But, no!-he cried, " The die is cast!"
He plunged!-he crossed!-and Rome was free no more

WHEN freedom from her mountain heigh'
Unfurl'd her standard to the air,
She tore the azure robe of night,
And set the stars of glory there!
She mingled with its gorgeous dies
The milky baldric of the skies,

And striped its pure celestial white,
With streakings from the morning light!
Then, froin her mansion in the sun,
She called her eagle bearer down,
And;gave into his mighty hand
The symbol of her chosen land!
Majestic monarch of the cloud!
Who rear'st aloft thy regal form,
To hear the tempest trumping loud,
And see the lightning lances driven,
When strides the warrior of the storm,
And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven!
Child of the sun! to thee'tis given
To guard the banner of the freeTo hover in the sulphur smoke,
To ward away the battle-stroke,
And bid its blendings shine afar,
Like rainbows on the cloud of war,
The harbinger of victory!
Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,
The sign of hope and triumph high!
When speaks the signal trumpet's tone,
And the long line comes gleaming on;
Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet,
Has dimm'd the glistening bayonetEach soldier's eye shall brightly turn,
To where thy meteor glories burn,
And as his springing steps advance,
Catch war and vengeance from the glance!
And when the cannon's mouthings loud,
Heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,
And gory sabres rise and fall,
Like shoots of flame on midnight pall!
There shall thy victor glances glow,
And cowering foes shall fall beneath
Each gallant arm that strikes below
That lovely messenger of death!
Flag of the seas! on ocean's wave,
Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave.
When death, careering on the gale,
Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,

Shall look at once to heaven and thee,
And smile to see thy splendours fly,
In triumph o'er the closing eye.

By angel hands to valour given!
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome

148.--INFLUENCE OF GREAT ACTIONS DEPENDENT ON
THEIR RE SULTS,.
GREAT actions and striking occurrences, having excited a
temporary admiration, often pass away and are forgotten,
because they leave no lasting results, affecting the prosperity
of communities. Such is frequently the fortune of the
most brilliant military achievements. Of the ten thousand
battles which have been fought; of all the fields fertilized
with carnage; of the banners which have been bathed in
blood; of the warriors who have hoped that they had
risen from the field of conquest to a glory as bright and as
durable as the stars, how few that continue long to interest
mankind! The victory of yesterday is reversed by the
defeat of to-day; the star of military glory, rising like a
meteor, like a meteor has fallen; disgrace and disaster
hang on the heels of conquest and renown; victor and
vanished presently pass away to oblivion, and the world
holds on its course, with the loss, only, of so many lives,
and so much treasure.
But if this is frequently, or generally, the fortune of
military achievements, it is not always so. There are
enterprises, military as well as civil, that sometimes check
the current of events, give a new turn to human affairs,
and transmit their consequences through ages. We see
350their importance in their results, and call them  great,
because great things follow. There have been battles
which have fixed the fate of nations. These come down
to us in history with a solid and permanent influence, not
created by a display of glittering armour, the rush of
adverse battalions, the sinking and rising of pennons, the
flight, the pursuit, and the victory; but by their effect in
advancing or retarding human knowledge, in overthrowing
or establishing despotism, in extending or destroying
human happiness. When the traveller pauses on the plains
of Marathon, what are the emotions which strongly agitate
his breast; what is that glorious recollection that thrills
through his frame, and suffuses his eyes? Not, I imagine,
that Grecian skill and Grecian valour were here most signally displayed; but that Greece herself was saved. It is
because to this spot, and to the event which has rendered
it immortal, he refers all the succeeding glories of the
republic. It is because, if that day had gone otherwise,
Greece had perished. It is because he perceives that her
philosophers and orators, her poets and painters, her sculptors and architects, her government and free institutions,
point backward to Marathon, and that their future existence
seems to have been suspended on the contingency, whether
the Persian or Grecian banner should wave victorious in
the beams of that day's setting sun. And as his imagination kindles at the retrospect, he is transported back to the
interesting moment: he counts the fearful odds of the contending hosts; his interests for the result overwhelms him;
he trembles as if it was still uncertain, and seems to doubt
whether he may consider Socrates and Plato, Demosthenes, Sophocles, and Phidias, as secure, yet, to himself and
to the world.                              WEBS'IER.

"BUT we must pause!" says the honourable gentleman. What! must the bowels of Great Britain be torn out

may make an experiment? Put yourselves, 0! that you
would put yourselves on the field of battle, and learn to

wars a man might, at least, have sonme feeling, some interest, that served to balance in his mind the impressions
which a scene of carnage and of death must inflict.
But if a man were present now at the field of slaughter,
and were to inquire for what they were fighting,-" Fighting 1" would be the answer; "I they are not fighting; they
are pausing." "Why is that man expiring? Why is
that other writhing with agony? What means this implacable fury?"  The answer must be,-" You are^ quite
wrong, sir, you deceive yourself-they are not fightingdo not disturb them--they are merely pausing! This man
is not expiring with agony--that man is not dead-he is
only pausing! Lord help you, sir! they are not angry
with one another: they have now no cause of quarrel;
but their country thinks that there should be a pause. All
that you see, sir, is nothing like fighting-there is no harm,
nor cruelty, nor bloodshed in it, whatever; it is nothing
more than a political pause! It is merely to try an experiment-to see whether Bonaparte will not behave himself
better than heretofore; and in the mean time we have agreed
to a pause, in pure friendship!"
And is this the way, sir, that you are to show yourselves
the advocates of order? You take up a system calculated
to uncivilize the world--to destroy order-to trample on
religion--to stifle in the heart, not merely the generosity
of noble sentiment, but the affections of social nature; and
in the prosecution of this system, you spread terror and
devastation all around you.                      Fox.
150.-PREVALENCE OF WAR.
WAR is the law of violence. Peace the law of love.
That law of violence prevailed without mitigation from the
murder of Abel to the advent of the Prince of Peace.
We might have imagined, if history had not attested the
reverse, that an experiment of four thousand years would
have sufficed to prove, that the rational and valuable ends
of society can never be attained, by constructing its institutions in conformity with the standard of war. But the
sword and the torch had been eloquent in vain. A thousand
battle-fields, white with the bones of brothers, were counted
352as idle advocates in the cause of justice and humanity.
Ten thousand cities, abandoned to the cruelty and licentiousness of the soldiery: and burnt, or dismantled, or
razed to the ground, pleaded in vain against the law of vio
lence. The river, the lake, the sea, crimsoned with the
blood of fellow citizens, and neighbours, and strangers,
had lifted up their voices in vain to denounce the folly and
wickedness of war.'rhe shrieks and agonies, the rage
and hatred, the wounds and curses of the battle-field, and
the storm and the sack, had scattered in vain their terrible
warnings throughout all lands. In vain had the insolent
Lysander destroyed the walls and burnt the fleets of Athens,
to the music of her own female flute-players. In vain had
Scipio, amid the ruins of Carthage, in the spirit of a gloomy
seer, applied to Rome herself the prophecy of Agamemnon.
"The day shall come, the great avenging day,
Which Troy's proud glories in the dust shall lay;
When Priam's power, and Priam's self shall fall,
And one prodigious ruin swallow all."
In vain had Pyrrhus exclaimed, as for all the warrior
gamblers of antiquity, " One such victory more and I am
undone." In vain had the disgrace and the sufferings of
Miltiades, and Nicias, of Themistocles, Pausanias, and
Alcibiades; of Marius and Sylla, of Hannibal, Pompey,
and Caesar, filled the nations with pity and dismay. The
lamentations of the widow and the tears of the orphan, the
broken hearts of age and the blasted hopes of youth, and
beauty, and love, had pleaded in vain against the law of
violence. The earth had drunk in the life-blood of the
slain, and hidden their mangled bodies in her bosom: and
there the garden, the orchard, and the harvest, flourished
once more beautiful in the tints of nature, and rich in the
melody of fount, and leaf, and breeze. The waters have
swallowed into their depths the dying and the dead, and
the ruined fleets both of victor, and vanquished; and again
the waves danced in their sportiveness, or rushed in their
fury, over the battle-plain of hostile navies. The innocence
of childhood had forgotten the parent's violent death, the
widow had recovered the lost smile of former years, thle
miserable old man had been gathered to his fathers, and
affection had found new objects for its attachments.

151.-IMPRESSIONS DERIVED FROM THE STUDY OF HISTORY.
THE study of the history of most other nations, fills
the mind with sentiments not unlike those which the American traveller feels on entering the venerable and lofty
cathedral of some proud old city of Europe. Its solemn
grandeur, its vastness, its obscurity, strike awe to the heart.
From the richly painted windows, filled with sacred emblems and strange antique forms, a dim religious light falls
around. A thousand recollections, of romance, and poetry,
and legendary story, come crowding in upon him. He is
surrounded by the tombs of the mighty dead, rich with the
labours of ancient art, and emblazoned with the pomp of
heraldry.
What names does he read upon them? Those of
princes and nobles who are now remembered only for their
vices, and of sovereigns, at whose death no tears were
shed, and whose memories lived not an hour in the affections of their people.-There, too, he sees other names,
long familiar to him for their guilty or ambiguous fame.'There rest, the blood-stained soldier of fortune--the orator,
who was ever the ready apologist of tyranny--great scholars, who were the pensioned flatterers of power-and
poets, who profaned their heaven-gifted talent to pamper
the vices of a corrupted court.
Our own history, on the contrary, like that poetical
temple of fame, which was reared by the imagination of
Chaucer, and decorated by the taste of Pope, is almost
exclusively dedicated to the memory of the truly great.
Or rather, like the Pantheon of Rome, it stands in calln
and severe beauty amid the ruins of ancient magnificence
and " the toys of modern state."  Within, no idle ornament encumbers its bold simplicity. The pure light of
heaven enters from above and sheds an equal and serene
radiance around. As the eye wanders about its extent, it
beholds the unadorned monuments of brave and good men
who have greatly bled or toiled for their country, or it rests
on votive tablets inscribed with the names of the best
benefactors of mankind.
Yes-land of liberty! thy children have no cause to
blush for thee. What though the arts have reared no muonu354VERPLANCK-MANSFIELD.
ments among us, and scarce a trace of the muse's footstep
is found in the paths of our forest, or along the banks of
our rivers; yet our soil has been consecrated by the blood
of heroes, and by great and holy deeds of peace. Its
wide extent has become one vast temple and hallowed asylum, sanctified by the prayers and blessings of the persecuted of every sect, and the wretched of all nations.
Land of refuge-land of benedictions! Those prayers
still arise, and they still are heard. " May peace be within thy walls and plenteousness within thy palaces."
1 "May there be no decay, no leading into captivity, and
no complaining in thy streets."  " May truth flourish out
of the earth, and righteousness look down from heaven."

152.-NOBLE BURST OF JUDICIAL ELOQUENCE.-DELIVERED
IN THE CELEBRATED CASE OF THE KING AGAINST JOHN
WILKES.
IT is fit to take some notice of the various terrors hung
out: the numerous crowds which have attended and now
attend in and about the hall, out of all reach of hearing
what passes in court; and the tumults which, in other
places, have shamefully insulted all order and government.
Audacious addresses in print dictate to us, from those they
call the people, the judgment to be given now, and afterwards upon the conviction. Reasons of policy are urged,
from danger to the kingdom, by commotions and general
confusion.
Give me leave to take the opportunity of this great and
respectable audience to let the whole world know, all such
attempts are vain. Unless we have been able to find an
error which will bear us out, to reverse the outlawry, it
nust be affirmed. The constitution does not allow reasons
of state to influence our judgments: God forbid it should!
We must not regard political consequences, how formidable
soever they might be: if rebeIlion was the certain consequence, we are bound to say "' Fiattjustitia, ruat cxlum."
The constitution trusts the king with reasons of state and
policy: he may stop prosecutions; he may pardon offences; it is his to judge whether the law or the criminal
should yield. We have no election: none of us encouraged
355THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
or approved the commission of either of the crimes of
which the defendant is convicted: none of us had any hand
in his being prosecuted. It is not in our power to stop it;
it was not in our power to bring it on. We cannot pardon.
We are to say, what we take the law to be: if we do not
speak our real opinions, we prevaricate with God and our
own consciences.
I pass over many anonymous letters I have received:
those in print are public; and some of them have been
brought judicially before the court. Whoever the writers
are, they take the wrong way: I will do my duty unawed.
What am I to fear?  That nendax infamia from the
press, which daily coins false facts and false motives?
The lies of calumny carry no terror to me: I trust that
my temper of mind, and the colour and conduct of my life,
have given me a suit of armour against these arrows. If,
during this king's reign, I have ever supported his government, and assisted his measures, I have done it without
any other reward, than the consciousness of doing what I
thought right. If I have ever opposed, I have done it upon
the points themselves, without mixing in party or faction,
and without any collateral views. I honour the king, and
respect the people; but, many things acquired by the
favour of either, are, in my account, objects not worth
ambition. I wish popularity; but it is that popularity
which follows, not that which is run after; it is that popularity which, sooner or later, never fails to do justice to the
pursuit of not-. ends by noble means. I will not do that
which my conscience tells me is wrong, upon this occasion,
to gain the huzzas of thousands, or the daily praise of all
the papers which come from the press: I will not avoid
doing what I think is right, though it should draw on me
the whole artillery of libels; all that falsehood and malice
can invent, or the credulity of a deluded populace can
swallow. I can say, with a great magistrate, upon an
occasion and under circumstances not unlike, " Ego hoc
animo semper fui, ut invi(diam virtute partam, gloriam,
non invidiarn, putarern."
The threats go further than abuse; personal violence is
(lenounced. I do not believe it: it is not the genius of the
worst men of this country, in the worst of times. But I!lave set my mind at rest. The last end that can happen
356to ainy man, never comes too soon, if he falls in support of
the law and liberty of his country, (forliberty is synonymous
with law and government.)    Such a shock, too, might be
productive of public good: it might awake the better part
of the kingdom out of that lethargy which seems to have be
numbed them, and bring the mad part back to their senses,
as men intoxicated are sometimes stunned into sobriety.
Once for all, let it be understood, " that ao endeavours
of this kind will influence any man who at present sits
here."  If they had any effect, it would be contrary to
their intent: leaning against their impression, might give
a bias the other way.  But I hope, and I know, that I have
fortitude enough to resist even that weakness.  No libels,
no threats, nothing that has happened, nothing that can
happen, will weigh a feather against allowing the defendant,
upon this and every other question, not only the whole
advantage he is entitled to from substantial law and justice,
but every benefit from  the most critical nicety of form,
which any other defendant could claim    under the like
objection.  The only effect I feel, is an anxiety to be able
to explain the grounds upon which we proceed; so as to
satisfy all mankind " that a flaw of form given way to in
this case, should not have been got over in any other."

154.-CONDUCT OF LA FAYETTE IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.
THE war of American Independence is closed. The
people of the North American Confederation are in union,
sovereign and independent. La Fayette, at twenty-five
years of age, has lived the life of a patriarch, and illustrated
the career of a hero. Had his days upon earth been then
numbered, and had he then slept with his fathers, illustrious
as for centuries their names had been, his name, to the end
of time, would have transcended them all. Fortunate
youth! fortunate beyond even the measure of his companions in arms with whom he had achieved the glorious
consummation of American Independence. His fame was
all his own; not cheaply earned; not ignobly won. His
fellow soldiers had been the champions and defenders of
their country. They reaped for themselves, for their
wives, their children, their posterity to the latest time, the
rewards of their dangers and their toils. La Fayette had
watched, and laboured, and fought, and bled, not for himself, not for his family, not, in the first instance, even for
his country. In the legendary tales of chivalry we lead

of tournaments at which a foreign and unknown knight
suddenly presents himself, armed in complete steel, and,
with the vizor down, enters the ring to contend with the
assembled flower of knighthood for the prize of honour,
to be awarded by the hand of beauty; bears it in triumph
away, and disappears from the astonished multitude of
competitors and spectators of the feats of arms. But where,
in the rolls of history, where, in the fictions of romance,
where, but in the life of La Fayette, has been seer the
noble stranger, flying, with the tribute of his name, his
rank, his affluence, his ease, his domestic bliss, his treasure,
his blood, to the relief of a suffering and distant land, in
the hour of her deepest calamity-baring his bosom to her
foes; and not at the transient pageantry of a tournament,
but for a succession of five years sharing all the vicissitudes
of her fortunes; always eager to appear at the post of
danger-tempering the glow of youthful ardour with the
cold caution of a veteran commander; bold and daring in
action; prompt in execution; rapid in pursuit; fertile in
expedients; unattainable in retreat; often exposed, but
never surprised, never disconcerted; eluding his enemy
when within his fancied grasp; bearing upon him with
irresistible sway when of force to cope with him in the
conflict of arms? And what is this but the diary of La
Fayette, from the day of his rallying the scattered fugitives
of the Brandywine, insensible of the blood flowing from
his wound, to the storming of the redoubt at Yorktown?
J. Q. ADAMS.
155.-THE MOB.
I REMEMBER, (if, on such a subject, I may be pardoned
an illustration approaching the ludicrous,) to have seen the
two kinds of mob brought into direct collision. I was
present at the second great meeting of the populace of
London in 1819, in the midst of a crowd of I know not how
many thousands, but assuredly a vast multitude, which was
gathered together in Smithfield market. The universal
distress was extreme; it was a short time after the scenes
at Manchester, at which the public mind was exasperated;
-deatlls by starvation were said not to be rare;-ruin by
the stagnation of business was general;-and some wereTHE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
already brooding over the dark project of assassinating the
ministers, which was not long after matured by-Thistlewood and his associates; some of whom, on the day to
which I allude, harangued this excited, desperate, starving
assemblage. When I considered the state of feeling prevailing in the multitude around me,-when I looked i.n
their lowering faces,-heard their deep, indignant exclamations,--reflected on the physical force concentrated, probably that of thirty or forty thousand able-bodied men;
and added to all this, that they were assembled to exercise
an undoubted privilege of British citizens; I did suppose
that any small number of troops, who should attempt to
interrupt them, would be immolated on the spot. While
I was musing on these things, and turning in my mind the
commonplaces on the terrors of a mob, a trumpet was heard
to sound,-an uncertain, but a harsh and clamorous blast.
I looked that the surrounding stalls, in the market, should
have furnished the unarmed multitude at least with that
weapon, with which Virginius sacrificed his daughter to
the liberty of Rome; I looked that the flying pavement
should begin to darken the air. Another blast is heard,--
a cry of' The horse-guards!' ran through- the assembled
thousands; the orators on the platform were struck mute;
and the whole of that mighty host of starving, desperate
men incontinently took to their heels; in which, I must
confess,-feeling no call, on that occasion, to be faithful
found among the faithless,--I did myself join them. We
had run through the Old Bailey and reached Ludgate hill,
before we found out that we had been put to flight by a
single mischievous tool of power, who had come triumphing down the opposite street on horseback, blowing a stagecoachman's horn.                            EVERETT.
156.-NATIONAL RECOLLECTIONS THE FOUNDATION OF
NATIONAL CHARACTER.
How is the spirit of a free people to be formed, and
animated, and cheered, but out of the store-house of its
historic recollections! Are we to be eternally ringing the
changes upon Marathon and Thermopylae; and going back
to read in obscure texts of Greek and Latin, of the exemplars of patriotic virtue? I thank God that we can find
them nearer home, in our own country, on our own soil;that strains of the noblest sentiment that ever swelled in
the breast of man, are breathing to us out of every page of
our country's history, in the native eloquence of our mother tongue;-that the colonial and provincial councils of
America exhibit to us models of the spirits and character
which gave Greece and Rome their name and their praise
among nations. Here we ought to go for our instruction;
-the lesson is plain, it is clear, it is applicable. When
we go to ancient history, we are bewildered with the difference of manners and institutions. We are willing to pay
our tribute of applause to the memory of Leonidas, who
fell nobly for his country in the face of his foe. But
when we trace him to his home, we are confounded at the
reflection, that the same Spartan heroism, to which he
sacrificed himself at Thermopyhe, would have led him to
tear his own child, if it had happened to be a sickly babe,
-the very object for which all that is kind and good in
man rises up to plead,-from the bosom of its mother, and
carry it out to be eaten by the wolves of Taygetus. We
feel a glow of admiration at the heroism displayed at Marathon, by the ten thousand champions of invaded Greece;
but we cannot forget that the tenth part of the number
were slaves, unchained from the work-shops and door-posts
of their masters, to go and fight the battles of freedom. I
do not mean that these examples are to destroy the interest with which we read the history of ancient times;
they possibly increase that interest by the very contrast
they exhibit. But they. do warn us, if we need the warning, to seek our great practical lessons of patriotism at home;
out of the exploits and sacrifices of which our own country is the theatre; out of the characters of our own fathers.
Them we know,-the high-souled, natural, unaffected, the
citizen heroes. We know what happy firesides they left

habits they dared the perils of the field. There is no
mystery, no romance, no madness, under the name of
chivalry about them. It is all resolute, manly resistance
for conscience and liberty's sake, not merely of an overwhelmirg power, but of all the force of long-rooted habits
and native love of order and peace.

157.--EXPOSURE TO THE HORRORS OF INDIAN OUTRAGE
BUT am I reduced to the necessity of proving this point'
Certainly the very men who charged the Indian war on the
detention of the posts, will call for no other proof than the
recital of their own speeches. It is remembered with whal
emphasis, with what acrimony, they expatiated on tile
burden of taxes, and the drain of blood and treasure into
the western country, in consequence of Britain's holding
the posts. Until the posts are restored, they exclaimed,
the treasury and the frontiers must bleed.
If any, against all these proofs, should maintain that the
peace with the Indians will be stable without the posts, to
them I will urge another reply. From arguments calculated to produce conviction, I will appeal directly to the
hearts of those who hear me, and ask, whether it is not
already planted there? I resort, especially, to the convictions of the western gentlemen, whether, supposing no
posts and no treaty, the settlers will remain in security?
Can they take it upon them to say, that an Indian peace,
under these circumstances, will prove firm?  No, sir, it
will not be peace, but a sword: it will be no better than a
lure to draw victims within the reach of the tomahawk.
On this theme, my emotions are unutterable. If I could
find words for them, if my powers bore any proportion to
my zeal, I would swell my voice to such a note of remonstrance, it should reach every log-house beyond the mountains. I would say to the inhabitants, wake from your false
security; your cruel dangers, your more cruel apprehensions, are soon to be renewed; the wounds, yet unhealed,
are to be torn open again; in the daytime, your path
through the woods will be ambushed; the darkness of
midnight will glitter with the blaze of your dwellings.
You are a father--the blood of your sons shall fatten your
corn-fields: you are a mother--the war-whoop shall wake.the sleep of the cradle.OnI this subject, you need not suspect any deception on
your feelings. It is a spectacle of horror, which cannot be
overdrawn. If you have nature in your hearts, it will
speak a language, compared with which, all I have said or
can say, will be poor and frigid.
By rejecting the posts, we light the savage fires, we
bind the victims. This day we undertake to render account
to the widows and orphans whom our decision will make,
to the wretches that will be roasted at the stake, to our
country, and I do not deem it too serious to say, to conscience and to God. We are answerable, and if duty be
any thing more than a word of imposture, if conscience be
not a bugbear, we are preparing to make ourselves as
wretched as our country.
There is no mistake in this case, there can be none.
Experience has already been the prophet of events, and
the cries of our future victims have already reached us.
The western inhabitants are not a silent and uncomplaining
sacrifice. The voice of humanity issues from the shade
of their wilderness. It exclaims, that while one hand is
held up to reject this treaty, the other grasps a tomahawk.
It summons our imagination to the scenes that will open.
It is no great effort of the imagination to conceive that
events so niear are already begun. I can fancy that I listen
to the yells of savage vengeance, and the shrieks of torture.
Already they seem to sigh in the west wind--already they
mingle with every echo from the mountains.  AMEs.

Made way for liberty, and died!It must not be: this day, this hour,
Annihilates the oppressor's power!
All Switzerland is in the field,
She will not fly, she cannot yield--
She must not fall; her better fate
Here gives her an immortal date.

But every freeman was a host,
And felt as though himself were he,
On whose sole arm hung victory.

AMES---'I)ONTGOMERY.',TIHE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
It did depend on one indeed;
Behold him--Arnold Winkelried!
There sounds not to the trump of fame
The echo of a nobler name.
Unmark'd he stood amid the throng,
In rumination deep and long,
Till you might see, with sudden grace,
The very thought come o'er his face;
And, by the motion of his form,
Anticipate the bursting storm;
And, by the uplifting of his brow,
Tell where the bolt would strike, and how
But'twas no sooner thought than done!
The field was in a moment won:"Make way for liberty!" he cried,
Then ran, with arms extended wide,
As if his dearest friend to clasp;
Ten spears he swept within his grasp:
" Make way for liberty!" he cried,
Their keen points met from side to side;
He bow'd amongst them like a tree,
And thus made way for liberty.
Swift to the breach his comrnades fly;
"Make way for liberty!" they cry,
And through the Austrian phalanx dart,
As rush'd the spears through Arnold's heart;
While instantaneous as his fall,
Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all:
An earthquake could not overthrow
A city with a surer blow.
Thus Switzerland again was free;
Thus death made way for liberty.  MONTGOMERY
159.-THE ATHEIST AND THE ACORN.
" METHINKS the world seems oddly made,
And every thing amiss;"
A dull, complaining atheist said,
As stretch'd he lay beneath the shade,
And instanced it in this:
3646Behold," quothl he, " that mighty thing,
A pumpkin large and round,
Is held but by a little string,
Which upwards canlnot make it spring,
Nor bear it from the groulld.
"While on this oak an acorn small,
So disproportion'd grows,
That whosoe'er surveys this all,
This universal casual ball,
Its ill contrivance knows.
"My better judgment would have hung
The pumpkin on the tree,
And left the acorn slightly strung,'Molngst things that on the surface sprung,
And weak and feeble be."
No more the caviller could say,
No further faults descry;
For upwards gazing, as he lay,
An acorn, loosen'd from its spray,
Fell down upon his eye.
The wounded part with tears ran o'er,
As punish'd for that sin;
Fool! had that bough a pumpkin bore,
Thy whimseys would have work'd no more,
Nor skull have kept them in.  ANONYMOUS.
160.---THE INDIAN.
THINK of the country for which the Indians fought!
Who can blame them? As Philip looked down from his
seat on Mount Hope, that glorious eminence, that
throne of royal state, which far
Outshone the wealth of Ormus or of Ind,
Or where the gorgeous east, with richest hand,
Showers on her kings barbaric pomp and gold,as he looked down and beheld the lovely scene wllich
spread beneath, at a summer sunset,-the distant hilltops blazing with gold, the slanting beams streaming

along the waters, the broad plains, the island groups,
majestic the forest,-could he be blamed, if his heart
burned within him, as he beheld it all passing, by no tardy
process, from beneath his control into the hands of the
stranger? As the river chieftains-the lords of the waterfalls and the mountains-ranged this lovely valley, can it
be wondered at, if they beheld with bitterness the forest
disappearing beneath the settler's axe; the fishing place
disturbed by his sawmills? Can we not fancy the feelings
with which some strong-minded savage, the chief of the
Pocomtuck Indians, who should have ascended the summit
of the sugar-loaf mountain,-(rising as it does before us, at
this moment, in all its loveliness and grandeur,)-in company with a friendly settler, contemplating the progress
already made by the white man, and marking the gigantic
strides, with which he was advancing into the wilderness,
should fold his arms and say,' White man, there is eternal
war between me and thee! I quit not the land of my
fathers, but with my life. In those woods, where I bent
my youlthful bow, I will still hunt tlhe deer; over yonder
waters I will still glide unrestrained in my bark canoe. By
those dashing waterfalls I will still lay up my winter's
store of food; on these fertile meadows I will still plant
my corn. Stranger, the land is mine! I understand not
these paper rights. I gave not my consent, when, as thou
sayest, these broad regions were purchased for a few
baubles, of my fathers. They could sell what was theirs;
they could sell no more. How could my father sell that
which the Great Spirit sent me into the world to live upon?
They knew not what they did. The stranger came, a
timid suppliant,-few and feeble, and asked to lie down on
the red man's bear-skin, and warm himself at the red man's
fire, and have a little piece -of land, to raise corn for his
women and children;--and now he is become strong, and
mighty, and bold, and spreads out his parchment over the
whole, and says, it is mine. Stranger! there is not room
for us both. The Great Spirit has not made us to live
together. There is poison in the white man's cup; the
white man's dog barks at the red man's heels. If I should
leave the land of my fathers, whither shall I fly? Shall I
go to the south, and dwell among the graves of the Pequots?
Shall I wander to the west;--the fierce Mohawk,-the
366man-eater,-is my foe. Shall I fly to the east, the great
water is before me. No, stranger; here I have lived, and
here will I die; and if here thou abidest, there is eternal
war between me and thee. Thou hast taught me thy arts
of destruction; for that alone I thank thee; and now take
heed to thy steps, the red man is thy foe. When thou
goest forth by day, my bullet shall whistle by thee; when
thou liest down at night, my knife is at thy throat.
The noonday sun shall not discover thy enemy, and the
darkness of midnight shall not protect thy rest. Thou
shalt plant in terror, and I will reap in blood; thou shalt
sow the earth with corn, and I will strew  it with ashes;
thou shalt go forth with the sickle, and I will follow after
with the scalping-knife; thou shalt build, and I will burn,
till the white man or the Indian shall cease from the land.
Go thy way for this time in safety,--but remember,
stranger, there is eternal war between me and thee!'

164.-CHARACTER OF LA FAYETTE.
THERE have been those who have denied to La Fayette
the name of a great man. What is greatness?    Does
goodness belong to greatness and make an essential part of
it? Is there yet enough of virtue left in the world, to echo
the sentiment, that'Tis phrase absurd, to call a villain great?
If there is, who, I would ask, of all the prominent names
in history, has run through such a career, with so little
reproach, justly or unjustly, bestowed?  Are military
courage and conduct the measure of greatness? La Fayette
was intrusted by Washington with all kinds of service;--
the laborious and complicated, which required skill and
patience, the perilous that demanded nerve;-and we see
him keeping up a pursuit, effecting a retreat, out-manteuvring a wary adversary with a superior force, harmonizing
the action of French regular troops and American militia,
commanding an assault at the point of the bayonet; and all
with entire success and brilliant reputation. Is the readiness to meet vast responsibility a proof of greatness? The
memoirs of Mr. Jefferson show us, as we have already
seen, that there was a moment in 1789, when La Fayette
took upon himself, as the head of the military force, the
entire responsibility of laying down the basis of the revolution. Is the cool and brave administration of gigantic
power, a mark of greatness? In all the whirlwind of the
revolution, and when; as commander-in-chief of the National Guard, an organized force of three millions of men,
who, for any popular purpose, needed but a word, a look,
to put them in motion,--and he their idol,--we behold
371THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
him ever calm, collected, disinterested; as free from affec.
tation as selfishness, clothed not less with humility than
with power. Is the fortitude required to resist the multitude pressing onward their leader to glorious crilne, a part
of greatness? Behold him the fugitive and the victim,
when he might have been the chief of the revolution. Is
the solitary and unaided opposition of a good citizen to the
pretensions of an absolute ruler, whose power was as
boundless as his ambition, an effort of greatness? Read
the letter of La Fayette to Napoleon Bonaparte, refusing
to vote for him as consul for life. Is the voluntary return,
in advancing years, to the direction of affairs, at a moment
like that, when in 1815 the ponderous machinery of the
French empire was flying asunder,--stunning, rending,
crushing thousands on every side,-a mark of greatness?
Contemplate La Fayette at the tribune, in Paris, when
allied Europe was thundering at its gates, and Napoleon
yet stood in his desperation and at bay. Are dignity, propriety, cheerfulness, unerring discretion in new and conspicuous stations of extraordinary delicacy, a sign of great.
ness-? Watch his progress in this country, in 1824 and
1825, hear him say the right word at the right time, in a
series of interviews, public and private, crowding on each
other every day, for a twelvemonth, throughout the Union,
with every description of persons, without ever wounding
for a moment the self-love of others, or forgetting the dignity
of his own position. Lastly, is it any proof of greatness
to be able, at the age of seventy-three, to take the lead in
a successful and bloodless revolution;--to change the
dynasty,--to organize, exercise, and abdicate a military
command of three and a half millions of men;--to take
up, to perform, and lay down the most momentous, delicate, and perilous duties, without passion, without hurry,
without selfishness? Is it great to disregard the bribes of
title, office, money;--to live, to labour, and suffer for
great public ends alone;-to adhere to principle under all
circumstances;--to stand before Europe and America conspicuous for sixty years, in the most responsible stations,
the acknowledged admiration of all good men?
EVERETT.
372EVERETT.
165.-THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.
I THINK I understand the proposition, that La Fayette
was not a great man. It comes from the same school
which also denies greatness to Washington, and which
accords it to Alexander and Ceesar, to Napoleon and to his
conqueror. When I analyze the greatness of these distinguished men, as contrasted with that of La Fayette and
Washington, I find either one idea omitted, which is essen-'ial to true greatness, or one included as essential, which
belongs only to the lowest conception of greatness. The
moral, disinterested, and purely patriotic qualities are
wholly wanting in the greatness of Cesar and Napoleon;
and on the other hand, it is a certain splendour of success,
a brilliancy of result, which, with the majority of mankind,
marks them out as the great men of our race. But not
only are a high morality and a true patriotism essential to
greatness;-but they must first be renounced, before a
ruthless career of selfish conquest can begin. I profess to
be no judge of military combinations; but, with the best
reflection I have been able to give the subject, I perceive,
no reason to doubt, that, had La Fayette, like Napoleon,
been by principle capable of hovering on the edges of
ultra-revolutionism; never halting enough to be denounced;
never plunging too far to retreat;-but with a cold and
well-balanced selfishness, sustaining himself at the head of
affairs, under each new phase of the revolution, by the
compliances sufficient to satisfy its demands,--had his principles allowed him to play this game, he might have anticipated the career of Napoleon. At three different periods,
he had it in his power, without usurpation, to take the
government into his own hands. He was invited, urged
to do so. Had he done it, and made use of the military
means at his command, to maintain and perpetuate his
power,--he would then, at the sacrifice of all his just
claims to the name of great and good, have reached that
which vulgar admiration alone worships,--the greatness
of high station and brilliant success.
But it was of the greatness of La Fayette, that he looked
down on greatness of the false kind. He learned his
lesson in the school of Washington, and took his first
practice in victories over himself. Let it be questioned
32THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
by the venal apologists of time-honoured abuses,-let it be
sneered at by national prejudice and party detraction; let
it be denied by the admirers of war and conquest;-by the
idolaters of success,-but let it be gratefully acknowledged
by good men; by Americans,--by every man, who has
sense to distinguish character from events; who has a
heart to beat in concert with the pure enthusiasm of
virtue.
But it is more than time, fellow citizens, that I commit
this great and good man to your unprompted contemplation. On his arrival among you, ten years ago,-when
your civil fathers, your military, your children, your whole
population poured itself out, as one throng, to salute him,
-when your cannons proclaimed his advent with joyous
salvos,-and your acclamations were responded from
steeple to steeple, by the voice of festal bells, with what
delight did you not listen to his cordial and affectionate
words;--' I beg of you all, beloved citizens of Boston, to
accept the respectful and warm thanks of a heart, which
has for nearly half a century been devoted to your illustrious city!' That noble heart,-to which, if any object
on earth was dear, that object was the country of his early
choice,--of his adoption, and his more than regal triumph,
-that noble heart will beat no more for your welfare.
Cold and motionless, it is already mingling with the dust.
While he lived, you thronged with delight to his presence,
-you gazed with admiration on his placid features and
venerable form, not wholly unshaken by the rude storms
of his career; and now that he is departed, you have assembled in this cradle of the liberties, for which, with
your fathers, he risked his life, to pay the last honours to
his memory. You have thrown open these consecrated
portals to admit the lengthened train which has come to
discharge the last public offices of respect to his name.
You have hung these venerable arches, for the second time
since their erection, with the sable badges of sorrow. You
have thus associated the memory of La Fayette in those
distinguished honoturs, which but a few years since you
paid to your Adams and Jefferson; and could your wishes
and mine have prevailed, my lips would this day have
been mute, and the same illustrious voice, which gave
utterance to your filial emotions over their honoured graves,
374would have spoken also, for you, over him who shared
their earthly labours,-enjoyed their friendship,--and has
now gone to share their last repose, and their imperishable
remembrance.
There is not, throughout the world, a friend of liberty,
who has not dropped his head when he has heard that
La Fayette is no more. Poland, Italy, Greece, Spain,
Ireland, the South American republics,-every country
where man is struggling to recover his birthright,-has
lost a benefactor, a patron in La Fayette. But you, young
men, at whose command I speak, for you a bright and
particular loadstar is henceforward fixed in the front of
heaven. What young man that reflects on the history of
La Fayette,-that sees him in the morning of his days the
associate of sages,-the friend of Washington,-but will
start with new vigour on the path of duty and renown?
And what was it, fellow citizens, which gave to our La
Fayette his spotless fame? The love of liberty. What
has consecrated his memory in hearts of good men? The
love of liberty.  What nerved his youthful arm  with
strength, and inspired him in the morning of his days with
sagacity and counsel? The living love of liberty. To
what did he sacrifice power, and rank, and country, and
freedom itself?  To the horror of licentiousness;-to the
sanctity of plighted faith, to the love of liberty protected
by law. Thus the great principle of your revolutionary
fathers, of your pilgrim sires, the great principle of the
age, was the rule of his life: Thle love of liberty protected by law.
You have now assembled within these renowned walls,
to perform the last duties of respect and love,-on the
birth-day of your benefactor, beneath that roof which has
resounded of old with the master voices of American
renown. The spirit of the departed is in high communion
with the spirit of the place;-the temple worthy of the new
name, which we now behold inscribed on its walls.
Listen, Americans, to the lesson, which seems borne to us
on the very air we breathe, while we perform these dutiful
rites. Ye winds, that wafted the pilgrims to the land of
promise, fan, in their children's hearts, the love of freedom;
-Blood, which our fathers shed, cry from the ground;--
Echoing arches of this renowned hall, whisper back the

167.- CHARACTER OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.
HE is fallen! We may now pause before that splendid
prodigy, which towered amongst us like some ancient ruin,
whose frown terrified the glance its magnificence attracted.
Grand, gloomy, and peculiar, he sat upon the throne a
sceptred hermit, wrapt in the solitude of his own originality. A mind bold, independent, and decisive-a will
despotic in its dictates-an energy that distanced expedition, and a conscience pliable to every touch of interest,
marked the outline of this extraordinary character--the
most extraordinary, perhaps that in the annals of this
world ever rose, or reigned, or fell. Flung into life, in
the midst of a revolution that quickened every energy of a
people who acknowledge no superior, he commenced his
course, a stranger by birth, and a scholar by charity!
With no friend but his sword, and no fortune but his
talents, he rushed in the list where rank, and wealth, and
genius had arrayed themselves, and competition fled from
him as from the glance of destiny.-He knew no motive
but interest-he acknowledged no criterion but successhe worshipped no god but ambition, and with an eastern
devotion he knelt at the shrine of his idolatry. Subsidiary
to this, there was no creed that he did not profess, there
was no opinion that he did not promulgate: in the hope
of a dynasty, he upheld the crescent; for the sake of a
divorce, he bowed before the cross: the orphan of St.
Louis, he became the adopted child of the republic: and
with a parricidal ingratitude, on the ruins both of the
throne and tribune, he reared the throne of his despotism.
A professed Catholic, he imprisoned the pope; a pretended

36THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
patriot, he impoverished the country; and, in the name
of Brutus, he grasped without remorse, and wore without
shame, the diadem of the Caesars! Through this pantomime of policy, fortune played the clown to his caprices.
At his touch, crowns crumbled, beggars reigned, systems
vanished, the wildest theories took the colour of his whim,
and all that was venerable, and all that was novel, changed
places with the rapidity of a drama. Even apparent defeat
assumed the appearance of victory-his flight from Egypt
confirmed his destiny-ruin itself only elevated him to
empire. But if his fortune was great, his genius was
transcendent; decision flashed upon his councils; and it
was the same to decide and to perform. To inferior
intellects his combinations appeared perfectly impossible,
his plans perfectly impracticable; but, in his hands, simplicity marked their development, and success vindicated
their adoption. His person partook the character of his
mind-if the one never yielded in the cabinet, the other
never bent in the field.-Nature had no obstacle that he
did not surmount-space no opposition that he did not
spurn; and whether amid Alpine rocks, Arabian sands, or
Polar snows, he seemed proof against peril, and empowered
with ubiquity! The whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity of his designs, and the miracle of their
execution. Skepticism bowed to the prodigies of his performance; romance assumed the air of history; nor was
there aught too incredible for belief, or too fanciful for
expectation, when the world saw a subaltern of Corsica
waving his imperial flag over her most ancient capitals.
All the visions of antiquity became commonplaces in his
contemplation; kings were his people-nations were his
outposts; and he disposed of courts, and crowns, and
camps, and churches, and cabinets, as if they were titular
dignitaries of the chess-board!-Amid all these changes,
he stood immutable as adamant.
It mattered little whether in the field or in the drawingroom-with the mob oi the levee-wearing the Jacobin
bonnet or the iron crown--banishing a Braganza, or
espousing a Hapsburg-dictating peace on a raft to the
Czar of Russia, or contemplating defeat at the gallows of
Leipsig--he was still the same military despot!
In this wonderful combination, his affectations of litera378PHILLIPS---AIKEN.
ture must not be omitted. The jailer of the press, he
affected the patronage of letters-the proscriber of books,
he encouraged philosophy--the persecutor of authors and
the murderer of printers, he yet pretended to the protection of learning! the assassin of Palm, the Silencer of
De Stael, and the denouncer of Kotzebue, he was the friend
of David, the benefactor of De Lille, and sent his academic
prize to the philosopher of England. Such a medley of
contradictions, and at the same time such an individual
consistency, were never united in the same character.--A
royalist-a republican and an emperor-a Mohammedana Catholic and a patron of the synagogue-a subaltern and
a sovereign--a traitor and a tyrant-a Christian and an
infidel-he was, through all his vicissitudes, the same stern,
impatient, inflexible original-the same mysterious, incomprehensible self-the man without a model, and without a shadow.                               PHILLIPS.

pest of the country! I could honour thy courage, but 1
must detest and punish thy crimes.
Rob. What have I done, of which you can complain?
Jtlex. Hast thou not set at defiance my authority; violated the public peace, and passed thy life in injuring the
persons and properties of thy fellow subjects?

you please to say, and endure what you please to inflict.
But my soul is unconquered; and if I reply at all to your
reproaches, I will reply like a free man.

advantage of my power, to silence those with whorn I
deign to converse.
Rob. I must then answer your question by another.
How have you passed your life?,ilex. Like a hero. Ask fame, and she will tell you.

Among the brave, I have been the bravest: among sovereigns, the noblest: among conquerers, the mightiest.
Rob. And does not fame speak of me too? Was there
ever a bolder captain of a more valiant band? Was there
ever,-but I scorn to boast. You yourself know that I have
not been easily subdued.
M.lex. Still, what are you but a robber, a base, dishonest
robber?
Rob. And what is a conqueror? Have not you, too,
gone about the earth like an evil genius, blasting the fair
fruits of peace and industry; plundering, ravaging, killing,
without law, without justice, merely to gratify an insatiable
lust for dominion? All that I have done to a single district
with a hundred followers, you have done to whole nations
with a hundred thousand. If I have stripped individuals,
yoLu have ruined kings and princes. If I have burnt a few
hamlets, you have desolated the most flourishing kingdoms
and cities of the earth. What is, then, the difference, but
that as you were born a kiing, and I a private man, you
have been able to become a mightier robber than I?.llex. But if I have taken like a king, I have given like
a king. If I have subverted empires, I have founded
greater. I have cherished arts, commerce, and philosophy.
Rob. I, too, have freely given to the poor what I took
from the rich. I have established order and discipline
among the most ferocious of mankind, and have stretched
out my protecting arm over the oppressed. I know,
indeed, little of the philosophy you talk of, but I believe
neither you nor I shall ever atone to the world for half the
mischief we have done it..Jlex. Leave me. Take off his chains, and use him

169-THANATOPSIS.
To him who in the love of nature holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
380Into his darker musings, with a mild
And gentle sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware.
When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;
Go forth under the open sky, and list
To nature's teaching, wlhile from all around,
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air,
Comes a still voice; yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding sun shall see no more
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image.
Earth that nourish'd thee shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;
And lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix for ever with the elements,
To be a brother to the insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon.
The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.
Yet not to tny eternal resting place
Shalt thou retire alone; nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
Witlh patriarchs of the infant world, with kings,
The powerful of the earth; the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulchre.
The hills,
Rock-ribb'd and ancient as the sun; the vales
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods; rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks
That make the meadows green; and pour'd round all
Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste;
381
BRYANT.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man.
The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
Of morning, and the Barcan desert pierce,
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save his own dashings, yet, the dead are there.
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep; the dead reign there alone.
So shalt thou rest; and what if thou shalt fall
Unheeded by the living; and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one as before will chase
His favourite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee.
As the long train
Of ages glide away the sons of men.
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron, and maid,
And the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man,
Shall one by one be gather'd to thy side,
By those, who in their turn shall follow them.
So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustain'd and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
BRYANT.

170.--THE DIAMOND RING.
YE ladies fair, with sunny smiles,
Come listen unto me,
While I rehearse what once befell
A dame of high degree.
A dame of high degree-and fair
As statue carved of old;
Her eyes were blue as sapphire gleams,
Her ringlets were like gold.
Her every motion breathed of grace,
Yet destitute of art;
And with her voice of music, spoke
The language of her heart.
Her husband was a gentleman,
From ancient nobles sprung;
By men esteem'd, by women loved,
Handsome, and brave, and young.
He dwelt upon his own domain,
In his ancestral home;
Nor felt a wish unsatisfied
In foreign climes to roam.
But with his lady dear he spent
Each blissful day and night;
And in the car of time they threw
Fresh roses of delight.
Alas! the fate of happiness
In this uncertain world!
When clouds arise, love's silken sails
Must speedily be furl'd.
The pennon, that so gayly flew,
Hangs idly to the mast;
And waves grow dark beneath the frown
Of the approaching blast.
The beauteous dame, alas! fell ill;
All human aid was vain,
I'o rend the arrow from her side
Or mitigate the pain.
383THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Death, like a jealous rival, came
To wound such perfect blissAnd on those lips of glowing red
He stamp'd an icy kiss!
She lay-how pale! a lily now,
That late surpass'd the rose;
Where late the summer flush was seen
Were strewn the winter snows.
Alas, for beauty! it must yield
Its treasures to the tomb,
And, like the hag, deformity,
Bow to the common doom!
From her sad lord's caressing arms
The darling wife was torn;
And to the cold, cold sepulchre,
By pitying neighbours borne.
It was a noble funeral,
And gorgeous to beholdThe coffin was of scented wood,
Her name was graved on gold.
The body lay, all pure and calm,
In its unbroken rest,
And one thin hand reposed upon
Her chaste and stainless breast.
What flashes there so dazzling bright!
It is an antique gem;
A diamond on her finger gleam'd,
Meet for a diadem!
They left her in the sepulchre,
Hewn from the marble stoneAnd all around with coffins fill'd,
Of many a silent one!
The midnight bell toll'd slowly from
The church-tower dark and high;
Which, like a rigid sentinel,
Alone stood scowling nigh.
384,THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Whose form glides from the old church-door,
Like wizard from his cell?
It is the sexton with his lamp,
Who went to stop the bell!
What makes he now among the tombs,
With tottering step and slow?
Ha! to the lady's sepulchre
The gray beard dares to go.
He springs the lock, he enters in,
He feebly gropes about;
Though fragile are his shivering limbs,
His harden'd heart is stout.
Wlhat makes he now? the golden plate
From off her coffin lid
He tears, and in his tatter'd robe
With trembling care'tis hid.
He lifts the lid--arrest, old man!
Thy base, polluting handWhat to decrepit age avails
The wealth of every land?
But avarice cleaves unto its prey,
Like lean dog to a bone;
The sexton takes the passive hand
And eyes the precious stone.
Ha 1 by the holy book! she stirsShe stirs and sits upright!
The wretched sexton turn'd to flee,
And stumbled in affright,
Across the threshold, o'er the graves,
Till by his own hearthside
He fell, insane with horrid fear,
And, deeply groaning, died!'Twas one at night--when Edward sat
In his ancestral hall:
Mute was his grief, and not a tear
From his parch'd eyes could fall.
33
385THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
His heart was desolate-but hark!
Who knocks at such an hour?
Whose voice is that, which, through the gloom,
Comes with such startling power
Edward, Edward, 0! Edward-i am cold,
The night is damp and drear,
Why, in so horrible a bed,
Was lain thy Ellen dear?
"My Edward, come, unbar for me
The massive, wide, hall-door,
Come-and I'll sing thee to sweet sleep,
As I have sung before!"
His mind was stunn'd by grief-he knew
No sentiment of fear,
But went and oped the wide hall-door,
And there, the moonlight clear
Reveal'd the white-robed, tender form
Of his beloved wife!
Not from the tombs a gliding ghost,
But breathing still with life!
She sank into his arms-he bore
Her senseless to her bed:
Her summon'd maidens shriek'd to sec
Their lady from the dead.
Three weary days and nights pass'd on,
And then the beauteous dame
Lean'd fondly on her husband's arm,
In blooming life the same.
To all the tenantry anon
The awful tale was knownThe lady, buried in a trance,
Walk'd homeward, all alone!
The sexton's body, stiff and cold,
Upon his earthen floor,
Frighted the early passer by
His open, cheerless door.
386The beauteous dame lived many yearsAnd now her daughters tell,
How in their dear remember'd home
This dread mischance befell.
The sparkling jewel, that she wore,
Is deem'd a priceless thing;
For, like a holy amulet,
They keep the diamond ring.            P. B.
171.-THE CHARACTERS OF JEFFERSON AND NAPOLEON
CONTRASTED.
IN the bearings of his personal character, Jefferson can
be safely compared with the contemporary rulers of nations.
not excepting him-the greatest of them all; nor need our
patriotism shrink from the singular contrast between two
men, chiefs for nearly an equal period of their respective
countries, and models of their different species,-Napoleon,
the emperor of a great nation-and Jefferson, the chief
magistrate of a free people.
Of that extraordinary being it is fit to speak with the
gentleness due to misfortune. Two centuries have scarce
sufficed to retrieve the fame of Cromwell from that least
expiable of crimes-his success over a feeble and profligate
race, more fortunate in their historian than their history:
and the memory of Napoleon must long atone equally for
his elevation and his reverses.'rhere are already those
who disparage his genius, as if this were not to humble the
nations who stood dismayed before it. Great talents,
varied acquirements, many high qualities, enlightened
views of legislation and domestic policy, it were bigotry to
deny to Napoleon. The very tide of his conquests over
less civilized nations, deposited in receding some benefits
even to the vanquished-and all that glory can contribute to
public happiness, was profutsely lavished on his country.
But in the midst of this gaudy infatuation there was that
which disenchanted the spell-that which struck its damp
chill into the heart of any man who, undazzled by the
vulgar decorations of power, looked only at the blessings it
might confer, and who weighed, instead of counting, these
victories. Such are the delusions which military ambition

sheds in turn on its possessor and on the world, that its
triumphs begin with the thoughtless applause of its future
victims, and end in the maddening intoxication of its own
prosperity. We may not wonder then if, when those who
should have first resisted his power were foremost in admiration and servility--when the whole continent of Europe
was one submissive dependence on his will--when among
the crowd of native and stranger suppliants who worshipped
before this idol there was only one manly and independent
voice to rebuke hlis excesses in a tone worthy of a free
people-that of the representative of Jefferson, we may
not wonder if all the brilliant qualities which distinguished
the youth of Napoleon were at last concentred into a
spirit of intense selfishness, and that the whole purpose to
which his splendid genius was perverted was the poor
love of swaying the destinies of other men-not to benefit,
not to bless-but simply to command them, to engross
every thing, and to be every thing. It was for this that
he disturbed the earth with his insane conquests,-for this
that the whole freedom of the human mind-the elastic
vigour of the intellect-all the natural play of the human
feelings-all free agency, were crushed beneath this fierce
and immitigable dominion, which, degrading the human
race into the mere objects and instruments of slaughter,
would soon have left nothing to science but to contrive the
means of mutual destruction, and nothing to letters except
to flatter the common destroyer. Contrast this feverish
restlessness which is called ambition-this expanded love
of violence which makes heroes-contrast these, as they
shone in the turbulent existence of Napoleon, with the
peaceful, disinterested career of Jefferson: and in all the
relations of their power-its nature, its employment, and
its result-we may assign the superiority to the civil magistrate.
Napoleon owed his elevation to military violence-Jefferson to the voluntary suffrage of his country. The one
ruled sternly over reluctant subjects-the other was but
the foremost among his equals who respected in his person
the image of their own authority. Napoleon sought to
enlarge his influence at home by enfeebling all the civil
institutions, and abroad by invading the possessions of his
neighbours-Jefferson preferred to abridge his power by
388strict constructions, and his counsels were uniformly dissuasive against foreign wars. Yet the personal influence
of Jefferson was far more enviable, for he enjoyed the unlimited confidence of his country--while Napoleon had no
authority not conceded by fear; and the extortions of force
are evil substitutes for that most fascinating of all sway--
the ascendancy over equals. During the undisputed possession of that power, Napoleon seemed unconscious of
its noblest attribute, the capacity to make man freer or
happier; and no one great or lofty purpose of benefiting
mankind, no generous sympathy for his race, ever disturbed
that sepulchral selfishness, or appeased that scorn of humanity, which his successes almost justified.-But the life
of Jefferson was a perpetual devotion, not to his own purposes,' but to the pure and noble cause of public freedom.
From the first dawning of his youth his undivided heart
was given to the establishment of free principles--free
institutions-freedom in all its varieties of untrammelled
thought and independent action. His whole life was consecrated to the improvement and happiness of his fellow
men; and his intense enthusiasm for knowledge and freedom was sustained to his dying hour. Their career was
as strangely different in its close as in its character., The
power of Napoleon was won by the sword-maintained by
the sword-lost by the sword. That colossal empire which
he had exhausted fortune in rearing broke before the first
shock of adversity. The most magnificently gorgeous of
all the pageants of our times--when the august ceremonies
of religion blessed and crowned that soldier-emperor, when
the allegiance of the great captains who stood by his side,
the applauses of assembled France in the presence of assenting Europe, the splendid pomp of war softened by the
smiles of beauty, and all the decorations of all the arts,
blended their enchantments as that imperial train swept up
the aisles of Notre Dame-faded into the silent cabin of
that lone island in a distant sea. The hundred thousands
of soldiers who obeyed his voice-thle will which made
the destiny of men--the name whose humblest possessor
might be a king-all shrunk into the feeble band who
followed the captivity of their master. Of all his foreign
triumphs not one remained, and in his first military conquest--his owll country, which he had adorned with the

monuments of his fame, there is now no place even for the
tomb of this desolate exile.-But the glory of Jefferson
became even purer as the progress of years mellowed into
veneration the love of his countrymen. He died in the
midst of the free people whom he had lived to serve; and
his only ceremonial, worthy equally of him and of them,
was the simple sublimity of his funeral triumph. His
power he retained as long as he desired it, and then voluntarily restored the trust, with a permanent addition-derived from Napoleon himself-far exceeding the widest
limits of the French empire-that victory of peace which
outweighs all the conquests of Napoleon, as one line of the
declaration of independence is worth all his glory.
But he also is now gone. The genius, the various learning, the private virtues, the public honours, which illustrated and endeared his name, are gathered into the tomb,
leaving to him only the fame, and to us only the remembrance, of them. Be that memory cherished without regret
or sorrow. Our affection could hope nothing better for
him than this long career of glorious and happy usefulness,
closed before the infirmities of age had impaired its lustre;
and thle grief that such a man is dead, may be well assuaged
by the proud consolation that such a man has lived.
BIDDLE.
172.---CONDUCT OF LA FAYETTE IN THE REVOLUTION OF
1830.
AT an early stage of the revolution of 1789, La Favette
had declared it as a principle that insurrection against
tyrants was the most sacred of duties. He had borrowed
this sentiment, perhaps, from the motto of Jefferson"'Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God." The principle itself is as sound as its enunciation is daring. Like
all general maxims, it is susceptible of very dangerous
abuses: the test of its truth is exclusively in the correctness
of its application. As forming a part of the political creed
of La Fayette, it has been severely criticised; nor can it be
denied that, in the experience of the French Revolutions,
the cases in which popular insurrection has been resorted
to, for the extinction of existing authority, have been so
frequent, so unjustifiable in their causes, so atrocious in
390their execution, so destructive to liberty in their consequences, that the friends of freedom, who know that she
can exist only under the supremacy of the law, have sometimes felt themselves constrained to shrink from the development of abstract truth, in the dread of the danger with
which she is surrounded.
In the revolution of the three days of 1830, it was the
steady, calm, but inflexible adherence of La Fayette to this
maxim which decided the fate of the Bourbons. After the
struggles of the people had commenced, and even while
liberty and power were grappling with each other for life
or death, the deputies elect to the legislative assembly,
then at Paris, held several meetings at the house of their
colleague, Lafitte, and elsewhere, at which the question
of resistance against the ordinances was warmly debated,
and aversion to that resistance by force was the sentiment
predominant in the minds of a majority of the members.
The hearts of some of the most ardent patriots quailed
within them at the thought of another overthrow of the
monarchy. All the horrible recollections of the reign of
terror, the massacre of the prisons in September, the
butcheries of the guillotine from year to year, the headless
trunks of Brissot, and Danton, and Robespierre, and last,
not least, the iron crown and sceptre of. Napoleon himself,
rose in hideous succession before them, and haunted their
imaginations. They detested the ordinances, but hoped
that, by negotiation and remonstrance with the recreant
king, it might yet be possible to obtain the revocation of
them, and the substitution of a more liberal ministry.
This deliberation was not concluded till La Fayette appeared among them. From that moment the die was cast.
They had till then no military leader. Louis Philippe,
of Orleans, had not then been seen among them.
In all the changes of government in France, from the
first assembly of notables, to that day, there never had
been an act of authority presenting a case for the fair and
just application of the duty of resistance against oppression, so clear, so unquestionable, so flagrant as this. The
violations of the charter were so gross and palpable, that
the most determined royalist could not deny them. The
mask had been laid aside. The sword of despotism had
been drawn, and the scabbard cast away. A king, openly
391
J. Q. ADAMS.THE T AMIERICAN SPEAKER.
forsworn, had forfeited every claim to allegiance; and the
only resource of the nation against him was resistance by
force. This was the opinion of La Fayette, and he declared himself ready to take the command of the National
Guard, should the wish of the people, already declared
thus to place him at the head of this spontaneous movement, be confirmed by his colleagues of the legislative
assembly. T'he appointment was accordingly conferred
upon him, and the second day afterwards Charles the
Tenth and his family were fugitives to a foreign land.
France was without a government. She might then
have constituted herself a republic; and such was, undoubtedly, the aspiration of a very large portion of her population. But with another, and yet larger portion of her
people, the name of republic was identified with the memory of Robespierre. It was held in execration; there
was imminent danger, if not absolute certainty, that the
attempt to organize a republic would have been the signal
for a new civil war. The name of a republic, too, was
hateful to all the neighbours of France; to the confederacy
of emperors and kings which had twice replaced the
Bourbons upon the throne, and who might be propitiated
under the disappointment and mortification of the result, by
the retention of the name of king, and the substitution of
the semblance of a Bourbon for the reality.
The people of France, like the Cardinal de Retz, more
than two centuries before, wainted a descendant from
Henry the Fourth, who could speak the language of the
Parisian populace, and who had known what it was to be
a plebeian. They found him in the person of Louis
Philippe, of Orleans. La Fayette himself was compelled
to compromise with his principles, purely and simply republican, and to accept him, first as lieutenant general of
the kingdom, and then as hereditary king. There was,
perhaps, in this determination, besides the motives which
operated upon others, a consideration of disinterested
delicacy, which could be applicable only to himself. If
the republic should be proclaimed, he knew that the chief
magistracy could be delegated only to himself. It must
have been a chief magistracy for life, which, at his age,
could only have been for a short term of years. Independent of the extreme dangers and difficulties to him392J. Q. ADAMS-HOOD.
self, to his family, and to his country, in which the position which he would have occupied might have involved
them, the inquiry could not escape his forecast, who, upon
his demise, could be his successor? and what must be the
position occupied by him? If, at that moment, he had but
spoken the word, he might have closed his career with a
crown upon his head, and with a withering blast upon his
name to the end of time.
With the Duke of Orleans himself, he used no concealment or disguise. When the crown was offered to that
prince, and he loolked to La Fayette for consultation, " You
know (said he) that I am qf the JJmerican school, and
partial to the Constitution of the United States."  So, it
seems, was Louis Philippe.  "I think with you," said
he. "It is impossible to pass two years in the United
States, without being convinced that their government is
the best in the world. But do you think it suited to our
present circumstances and condition!"  No, replied La
Fayette. They require a monarchy surrounlded by popular
institutions. So thought, also, Louis Philippe; and he
accepted the crown under the conditions upon which it was
tendered to him.
La Fayette retained tlhe command of the National Guard
so long as it was essential to the settlement of the new
order of things, on the basis of order and of freedom; so
long as it was essential to control the stormy and excited
passions of the Parisian people; so long as was necessary
to save the ministers of the guilty but fallen monarch from
the rash and revengeful resentments of their conquerors.
When this was accomplished, and the people had been
preserved from the calamity of shedding in peace the blood
of war, he once more resigned his command, retired in
privacy to La Grange, and resumed his post as a deputy in
the legislative assembly, which he continued to hold till
the close of life.                      J. Q. ADAMS.

174.-TRIAL OF ROARING RALPH.
(From Nick of the Woods.)
THE luck, good and bad together, which had distinguished
Roaring Ralph in all his relations with Roland Forrester
never, it seems, entirely deserted him. His improvident,
harum-scarum habits had very soon deprived him of all the
advantages that might have resulted from the soldier's
munificent gift, and left him a landless, good-for-nothing,
yet contented, vagabond as before. With poverty, returned sundry peculiar propensities, which he had manifested in former days; so that Ralph again lost odour in
the nostrils of his acquaintance; and the last time that
Forrester heard of him, he had got into a difficulty, in some
respects similar to that in the woods of Salt River, from
which Roland, at Edith's intercession, had saved him. In
a word, he was one day arraigned before a county-court
in Kentucky, on a charge of horse-stealing, and matters
went hard against him, his many offences in that line
having steeled the hearts of all against him, and the proofs
of guilt in this particular instance, being both strong and
manifold. Many an angry and unpitying eye was bent
upon the unfortunate fellow, when his counsel rose to
attempt a defence;-which he did in the following terms:
" Gentlemen of the Jury," said the man of law,-" here
is a man, Captain Ralph Stackpole, indicted before you on
the charge of stealing a horse; and the affair is pretty con395
HIiOOD---BIRD).THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
siderably proved on him."-Here there was a murnmur
heard throughout the court, evincing much approbation of
the counsel's frankness. " Gentlemen of the Jury," continued the orator, elevating his voice, " what I have to say
in reply, is, first, that that man thar', Captain Ralph Stackpole, did, in the year seventeen seventy-nine, when this
good State of Kentucky, and particularly those pairts adjacent to Bear's Grass and the mouth thereof, where now
stands the town of Louisville, were overrun with yelping
Injun-savages,-did, I say, gentlemen, meet two Injunsavages in the woods on Bear's Grass, and take their
scalps, single-handed-a feat, gentlemen of the jury, that
an't to be performed every day, even in Kentucky!"Here there was considerable tumult in the court, and
several persons began to swear.-" Secondly, gentlemen
of the jury," exclaimed the attorney at law, with a still
lander voice, " what I have to say secondly, gentlemen of
the jury, is, that this same identical prisoner at the bar,
Captain Ralph Stackpole, did, on another occasion, in the
year seventeen eighty-two, meet another Injun-savage in
the woods,--a savage armed with rifle, knife, and tomahawk,-and met him with-you suppose, gentlemen, with
gun, axe, and scalper, in like manner?-No, gentlemen of
the jury!--with his fists, and" (with a voice of thunder)
" licked him to death in the natural way!-Gentlemen of
the jury, pass upon the prisoner,-guilty, or not guilty?"
The attorney resumed his seat: his arguments were irresistible. The jurors started up in their box, and roared
out, to a man, "Not guilty!"   From that moment, it
may be supposed, Roaring Ralph could steal horses at his
pleasure. Nevertheless, it seems, he immediately lost his
appetite for horse-flesh; and leaving the land altogether,
he betook himself to a more congenial element, launched
his broad-horn on the narrow bosom of the Salt, and was
soon afterwards transformed into a Mississippi alligator;
in which amphibious condition, we presume, he roare
on till the day of his death.               DR. BIRD.

Capt. B. Indeed, that might be some loss; but who
respects it? I will tell you, sir, by the way of private, and
under seal, I am a gentleman, and live here obscure, and to

observe me, I would undertake, upon this poor head and
life, for the public benefit of the state, not only to spare
the entire lives of his subjects in general, but to save the
one half, nay, three parts of his yearly charge in holding
war, and against what enemy soever. And how would I
do it, think you?
Young K. Nay, I know not; nor can I conceive.
Capt. B. Why, thus, sir: I would select nineteen more
to myself, throughout the land; gentlemen they should be;
of a good spirit, and able constitution; I would choose
them by an instinct, a character that I have; and I woula
teach these nineteen the special rules, as your punto, your
404reverso, your stoccata, imbroccata, your passada, your
montanto; till they could all play very near, or altogether
as well as myself. This done, say the enemy were forty
thousand strong; we twenty would come into the field the
tenth of March, or thereabouts, and we would challenge
twenty of the enemy; they could not in their honour
refuse us. Well, we would kill them; challenge twenty
more, kill them; twenty more, kill theni, too; and thus
would we kill every man his twenty a day, that's twenty
score; twenty score, that's two hundred; two hundred a
day, five days a thousand; forty thousand; forty times
five, five times forty; two hundred days kills them all by
computation. And this I will venture my poor gentleman-like carcass to perform, provided there be no treason
practised upon us, by fair and discreet manhood; that is,
civilly by the sword.

Let this gentleman do his mind; but I will bastinado him,
by the bright sun, wherever I meet him.
Mat. Faith, and I'll have a fling at him, at my distance.
Enter Downright, walking over the stage.
Young K. God's so! Look ye where he is; yonder he
goes.
Down. What peevish luck have I; I cannot meet with
these bragging rascals!
Capt. B. It's not he, is it?
Young K. Yes, faith, it is he.
Mat. I'll be hanged then, if that were he.
Young K. I assure you that was he.
Step. Upon my reputation, it was he.
Capt. B. Had I thought it had been he, he must not
have gone so; but I can hardly be induced to believe it
was he yet.

Down. 0! Pharaoh's foot, have I found you? Come,

Capt. B. Gentleman of valour, I do believe in thee,
hear meDown. Draw your weapon, then.
Capt. B. Tall man, I never thought on't till now, body
of me! I had a warrant of the peace served on me even
now, as I came along, by a water bearer; this gentleman
saw it, Mr. Matthew. (Downright beats Captain Bobadil; Matthew runs away.)
Down.'Sdeath! you will not draw, then?
Capt. B. Hold, hold! under thy favour, forbear.
Down. Prate again, as you like this. You'll control
the point, you? Your consort is gone; had he stayed, he
had shared with vou, sir.                      [Exit.
Young K. Twenty, and kill them; twenty more, kill
them, too-ha, ha!
Capt. B. Well, gentlemen, bear witness; I was bound
to the peace, by this good day.
Young K. No, faith, it's an ill day, captain, never
reckon it other; but say you were bound to the peace,
the law allows you to defend yourself; that will prove but
a poor excuse.
Capt. B. I cannot tell, sir. I desire good construction,
in fair sort. I never sustained the like disgrace, by heaven.
Sure, I was struck with a planet.
Step. No, captain, you was struck with a stick.
Young K. Ay, like enough; I have heard of many that
have been beaten under a planet. Go, get you to a surgeon.'Slid! and these be your tricks, your passados and your
montantos, I'll none of them.
Capt. B. I was planet-struck, certainly.  [Exit.
Young K. 0, manners! that this age should bring forth
such creatures! that nature should be at leisure to make

Step. Mass! I'll have this cloak.
Young K. God's will,'tis Downright's.
Step. Nay, it's mine now; another might have ta'en it
up as well as I. I'll wear it, so I will.

JONSON-TOBIN.PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
3. The wise' and the foolish', the virtuous' and the vile',
the learned' and the ignorant', the temperate' and the profligate', must often be blended together.
4. In all stations and conditions, the important relations
take place, of masters' and servants', husbands' and wives',
parents' and children', brothers' and friends', citizens' and
subj ects'.
SERIES OF SERIESES.
RULE I.-W-1hen several members of a sentence, consist
ing of distinct portions of similar or opposite words in
a series, follotv in succession, they must be pronounced
singly, according to the number of members in each
portion, and together, according to the number of portions in the whole sentence, that the whole may form
one related compound series.
EXAMPLES.
l. The soul consists of many faculties, as the understanding' and the will', with all the senses both inward' and
outward'; or, to speak more philosophically, the soul can
exert herself in many different ways of action: she can
understand', will', imagine', see', and hear'; love' and discourse'; and apply herself to many other like exercises of
different kinds of natures'.
2. For I am persuaded that neither death', nor life'; nor
angels', nor principalities', nor powers'; nor things present',
nor things to come'; nor height', nor depth'; nor any other
creature', shall be able to separate us from the love of God,
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord'.
RULE IT.-W-here the sense of the sentence does not
require force, precision, or distinction, (which is but
seldom the case,) where the sentence commences with
a conditional or suppositive conjunction, or where the
language is plaintive and poetical, thefalling inflection
seems less suitable than the rising.
EXAMPLES.
1. When the gay and smiling aspect of things has be
gun to leave the passage to a man's heart thus thoughtlessly
unguarded'; when kind and caressing looks of every object

Balth. On your knees?'tis well!
Pray, for your time is short.
Hostess. Nay, do not kill us.
Balth. You have been tried, condemn'd, and only wait
For execution. Which shall I begin with?
Lamp. The lady, by all means, sir.
Balth. Come, prepare.             (To the Hostess.)
Hostess. Have pity on the weakness of my sex!
Balth. Tell me, thou quaking mountain of gross flesh,
Tell me, and in a breath, how many poisonsIf you attempt it-(to Lamp. who is endeavouring to make
off)-you have cook'd up for me?
Hostess. None, as I hope for mercy.
Balth. Is not thy wine a poison?
Hostess. No, indeed, sir;'Tis not, I own, of the first quality;
But--
Balth. What?
Hostess. I always give short measure, sir,
And ease my conscience that way.
Balth. Ease your conscience!
I'll ease your conscience for you.
Hostess. Mercy, sir!
Balth. Rise, if thou canst, and hear me.
Hostess. Your commands, sir?
Balth. If in five minutes all things are prepared
For my departure, you may yet survive.
Hostess. It shall be done in less.
Balth. Away, thou lump-fish!      [Exit Hostess.
Lamp. So! now comes my turn!'tis all over with me I
There's dagger, rope, and ratsbane in his looks!

Thou thing that hast no shadow in the sun!
Thou eel in a consumption, eldest born
Of Death on Famine! thou anatomy
Of a starved pilchard!
Lamp. I do confess my leanness. I am spare
And, therefore, spare me.
Balth. Why! wouldst thou have made me
A thoroughfare for thy whole shop to pass through?
Lamp. Man, you know, must live.
Balth. Yes: he must die, too.Lamp. For my patients' sakeBalth. I'll send you to the major part of them.
The window, sir, is open; come, prepare.
Lamp. Pray, consider;
I may hurt some one in the street.
Balth. Why, then,
I'll rattle thee to pieces in a dice-box,
Or grind thee in a coffee-mill to powder,
For thou must sup with Pluto: so, make ready;
Whilst I, with this good small-sword for a lancet,
Let thy starved spirit out, (for blood thou hast none,)
And nail thee to the wall, where thou shalt look
fLike a dried beetle, with a pin stuck through him.
Lamp. Consider my poor wife.
Balth. Thy wife!
Lamp. My wife, sir.
Balth. Hast thou dared think of matrimony, too?
No flesh upon thy bones, and take a wife!
Lamp. I took a wife because I wanted flesh.
I have a wife, and three angelic babes,
Who, by those looks, are wellnigh fatherless.
Balth. Well, well! your wife and children shall plead
for you.
Come, come; the pills! where are the pills? produce them.
Lamp. Here is the box.
Baith. Were it Pandora's, and each single pill
Had ten diseases in it, you should take them.
Lamp. What, all?
Balth. Ay, all; and quickly, too. Come, sir, begin--
that's well! another.
Lamp. One's a dose.

SCENE. - Otutside of Scout's House.
Kate and Sheepface.
Kate. IF you wants a lawyer to get you fairly out of a
scrape, my master's the man for your money, Sheepface.
Sheep. I remember he stood my friend before, from
being hanged at York; and, would you believe it? only
for mending the complexion of a bald-faced horse: and, 1
don't know how it was, I have such a treacherous memory,
but somehow or other, I forgot to pay him.
Kate. O! never mind, he won't remember that; but be
careful not to tell him your master's name. I know he
would not be concerned against Mr. Snarl for the world.
Sheep. No, no; I'll only tell him'tis my master, and
the'll think I mean the rich farmer I lived with formerly.
Kate. Well, well; that will do-but here he comes:
I'll go in.                                    [Exit.
Enter Scout.
Scout. Egad! I think I have made a good morning's
work! This cloth will enable me to make a genteel appearance. But who have we got here? sure, I should
know that face. Hark ye! sir, didn't I save you and your
brother from being hanged, some time ago, at York?
Sheep. Yes.
Scout. And, by the same rule, I think one of you forgot
to pay me.
Sheep. That was brother.
Scout. One of you got clear off; and the other died,
soon after, in prison.
Sheep. That was not I.
Scout. No, no; I see it was not.
Sheep. For all that, I was sicker than my brother; but
I am come to ask your worship to stand my friend against
a-his worship, my master.
Scout. What, the rich farmer here, that lives in the
neighbourhood?
Sh1eep. Yes, yes; he lives in the neighbourhood, sure
enough; and if you will stand my friend, you shall be paid
to your heart's contey t.
410THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Scout. Ay, now you speak to the purpose: come, you
must tell me how it was.
Shleep. Why, you must know, my master gives me but
small wages; very small wages, indeed; so I thought I
might as well do a little business on my own account; and
so make myself amends without any damage to him, with
an honest neighbour of mine-a little bit of a butcher by
trade.
Scout. Well, but what business can you have to do with
him?
Sheep. Why, saving your worship's presence, I hinders
the sheep from dying of the rot.
Scout. Ah! how do you contrive that?
Shleep. I cuts their throats before it comes to them.
Scout. What, I suppose, then, your master thinks you
kill his sheep for the sake of selling their carcasses?
Sheep. Yes; and I cannot beat it out of his head, for the
soul of me.
Scout. Well, then, you must tell me all the particulars
about it. Relate every circumstance, and don't hide a
single item.
Shleep, Why, then, sir, you must know that, last night,
as I was going down-must I tell the truth?
Scout. Yes, yes; you must tell the truth here, or we
shall not be able to lie to the purpose anywhere else.
Sheep. Well, then, last night, after I was married, having
a little leisure time upon my hands, I goes down to our
pens; and, as I was musing on I don't know what, out I
takes my knife, and happening by mere accident, saving
your worship's presence, to put it under the throat of one
of the fattest wethers; I don't know how it came about,
but I had not been long there before the wether died, and
all of a sudden, as a body may say.
Scout. What, and somebody was looking on all the
while?
Sheep. Yes; master, from behind the hedge; and would
have it, it died all along with me; and so, as you see, he
laid such a shower of blows on me, that it kept me out
of temper all night; but I hope your worship will stand
my friend, and not let me lose the fruits of my honest
labours all at once.
411THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Scout. Why, there are two ways of settling this business; and one is, I think, to be done without putting you
to any expense.
Sheep. Let's try that first, by all means.
Scout. You have scraped up something in your master's
service.
Sheep. I have been up early and late for it, sir.
Scout. I suppose you have taken care to have your
savings all in hard cash?
She+. Yes, sir.
Scout. Well, then, when you go home, take it and hide
it in the safest place you can find.
Sheep. Yes, sir, that I'll do.
Scout. I'll take care your master shall pay all costs and
charges.
Sheep. Ay, so he ought; he can afford it.
Scout. It shall be nothing out of your pocket.
Sh eep. That's just as I would have it.
Scout. He'll have all the trouble and expense of bringing
you to trial, and after tlat, have the pleasure of seeing you
hanged.
Sheep. Let's take the other way.
Scout. Well, let me see: I suppose he'll take out a
warrant against you, and have you taken before Justice
Mittimus.
Sheep. So I understand.
Scout. I think the justice's credulity is easily imposed
on; so, when you are ordered before him, I'll attend; and
to all the questions that you are asked, answer nothing, but
imitate the voice of the lambs, when they bleat after the
ewes. You can speak that dialect.
Sheep. It's my mother tongue.
Scout. But, if I bring you clear off, I expect to be very
well paid for this.
Sheep. So you shall; I'll pay you to your heart's content.
Scout. Be sure you answer nothing but baa!
Shleep. Baa!
Scout. Ay, that will do very well; be sure you stick to
that.
Sheep. Yes, your worship, never fear I. What trouble
a body has to keep one's own in this world!  [Exeunt

Scout. Wife, wife, here comes the doctor; he brings
me the cooling mixture-the cooling mixture!
Snarl. The cooling mixture!
Mrs. S. O! sir, I hope you have brought something for
my poor husband; he has been confined to his room, and
has not been out this fortnight.
Snarl. Not out of his room this fortnight!
Mrs. S. No, sir; this day fortnight, of all the good days
in the year, he was seized with a lunacy fit, and has not
been out of doors since.
Snarl. Why, woman, what are you talking about?
Why, he came to my shop this morning; and, by the same
token, he bought four yards of iron-gray cloth, and I am
come for my money.
Mrs. S. This morning!
Snarl. This morning; and invited me to dine with him
to-day off a goose, and to receive fifty pounds which his
father owed mine. I'll speak to him. How do you do
good Mr. Scout?
Scout. O! how d'ye do, good Mr. Drench?

Snarl. There, there, there! he knows me, he knows

me coming to see you. I have never called on you since
I came to live in this part of the country.
Snarl. Never called'v me! 0, the deuse! I shall never
get my cloth again. Why, man, you called on me this
morning, and bought foulr yards of iron-gray cloth, and I
am come for my money besides fifty pounds your father

Where is your lawyer, neighbour Snarl?
Snarl. I am my own lawyer; I shall employ nobody:
that, would cost more money.

you imposed upon me? What's the meaning of all this?
Is that the plaintiff?
Sheep. (To Scout.) Yes, that's his honour, my good
master.
Scout. 0, the deuse! What shall I do? I must stay and
brazen it out; if I sneak out of court, it will cause suspicion. (d3side.)

Snarl. Well, then, that thief, there--
Just. No abuse, no abuse!
Snarl. Well, then, I say, that rascal, my shepherdNo--Do my eyes deceive me?     Sure, that is-yes, it
must be he: if I had not left him very bad, I could have
sworn-yes, yes,'tis him-and that other rascal came to
my shop and bought-No, no, I don't mean so; that rascal
there has killed fourteen of my fattest wethers. What
answer do you make to that?
Scout. I deny the fact.
Snarl. What is become of them, then?
Scout. They died of the rot.
Snarl.'Tis him;'tis his voice, too.
415THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Just. What proof have you got?
Siarl. Why, this morning, he came to my house--No,
no; I mean, I went down last night to the pens, having
long suspected him--'tis he,'tis he! and he began a long
story about fifty pounds-No, no; I don't mean that-and
there I caught him in the very fact.
Scout. That remains to be proved.
Snarl. Yes, I will swear it is the very man.
Just. Why, this is the very man: but is it certain that
your wethers died of the rot? What answer do you make
to that?
Sznarl. Why, I tell you, he came this very morning, and
after talking some time, makes no more to do than carries
off four!yards of it.
Juast. Four yards of your wethers?
Snarl. No, no; four yards of my cloth: I mean that
other thief-that other, there.
Just. What other? What otller, neighbour Snarl?
Scout. Why, he's mad, an' please your worship.
Just. Truly, I think so, too; harkye! neighbour Snarl,
not all the justices in the county, no, nor their clerks either,
can make any thing of your evidence. Stick to your
wethers! stick to your wethers, or I must release the
prisoner; but, however, I believe it will be the shortest
way to examine him myself. Come here, my good fellow,
hold up your head, don't be frightened, tell me your
name.
Shleep. Baa!
Snarl. It's a lie, it's a lie! his name is Sheepface.
Just. Well, well; Sheepface or Baa, no matter for the
name. Did Mr. Snarl give you in charge fourscore sheep,
Sheepface?
Shleep. Baa!
Just. I say, did Mr. Snarl catch you in the night, killing
one of his fattest wethers?
Sheep. Baa!
Just. What does he mean by baa?
Scout. Please your worship, the blows he gave this
poor fellow on the head have so affected his senses, he
can say nothing else; he is to be trepanned as soon as the
court break up; and the doctors say it is the whole materia
medica against a dose of jalap, he never recovers.
416THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Just. But the act, and in that provided, forbids all blows,
particularly on the head.
Snarl. It was dark, and when I strike, I never mind
where the blows fall.
Scout. A voluntary confession, a voluntary confession!
Just. A voluntary confession, indeed.  Release the
prisoner; I find no cause of complaint against him.
[Exeunt Constable.
Snarl. No cause of complaint against him! You are a
pretty justice, indeed! one kills my sheep, and the other
pays me with Sir Hugh Witherington, and then you see
no cause of complaint against him.
Just. Not I, truly.
Snarl. A pretty day's work I have made, indeed! a suit
of law, and a suit of iron-gray cloth, both carried against
me; but as for you, Mr. Lawyer, we shall meet again.

Jutst. 0, fie! neighbour Snarl, you are to blame, very
much to blame, indeed.
Scout. Come, now it is all over, go anid thank his
worship.

do not catch cold in your head; go and get trepanned, and

Scout. Bravo, my boy! You have acted your part
admirably, and I think I did very well to bring you off so
cleverly; and now I make no doubt but, as you are a
very honest fellow, you'll pay me as generously as you
promised.
Sheep. Baa!
Scout. Ay, very well, very well, indeed! you did that
very well just now, but there's no occasion to have it over
any more. I'm talking about my fee, you know, Sheepface! Yes, yes, I tell you, it was very well done; but at
this time, you know, my fee is the question.

1. Ambition creates hatred, shyness, discords, seditions, and wars.
2. To be moderate in our views, and to proceed temperately in the
pursuit of them, is the best way to ensure success.
3. Joy, grief, love, admiration, devotion, are all of them passions
which are naturally musical.
4. Substantives, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions must necessarily be found in all languages.
5. The several kinds of poetical composition which we find in Scripture are chiefly the didactic, the elegiac, pastoral, and lyric.
6. Discomposed thoughts, agitated passions, and a ruffled temper,
poison every pleasure of life.
7. The great business of life is to'be employed in doing justly, loving
mercy, and walking humbly with our Creator.
8. Tranquillity, order, and magnanimity dwell with the pious and
resigned man.
9. A wise man will desire no more than what he may get justly, use
soberly, distribute cheerfully, and live upon contentedly.

to make up an estate; then to arrive at honours; then to retire.

Scout. Out of my sight, or I'll break every bone in your
dog's skin, you sheep-stealing scoundrel! would you cheat
one that has cheated hundreds? Get home to your hidingplace.
Shleep. Baa!
Scout. Away, and mind how you and your wife play
the rest of your parts; and, perhaps, I may forgive you,
if we succeed; if not, I will make an example of you, you
rascal!

Enter Justice Mittimus, and Kate.
Just. Poor fellow! like to die, you say?
Kate. Yes, your worship. O dear! (/Crying.)
Just. Well, well; comfort yourself: remember, you
was only married yesterday.
Kate. That's the very thing, sir; if he had but lived a
little longer, I should not have cared so much about it;
but to be cut off just in the honey-moon, is veryhard. Oh,
oh, oh! But I am not revengeful, and your worship knows
how much I love my master's daughter, Harriet; and
('harles, Mr. Snarl's son, is in love with her; but his
father won't agree to the match.
Just. O! I understand you. So, you'll hush up matters,
provided he'll agree to the marriage? Well, what say you,
neighbour Scout!
Scout. Why-why, I don't know what to say to it. As
you all seem willing to settle the business, I don't like to
stand out, and so I agree to it. But I think, your worship,
I had better go in and fill the blanks of a bond, and make
hirh sign it, or, when all is over, he'll retract from his word.
Just. Well, do so. Here he comes. Go, go!
[Exeunt Scout and Kate.
Enter Snarl and two Constables.
So, neighbour Snarl, I find that the blows you gave the
poor fellow on the head have occasioned his death.
Snarl. 0, the deuse!
418Just. But, harkye! neighbour, I have got a proposal to
make, which, perhaps, may not be disagreeable to you:
your son Charles, it seems, is in love with Harriet, lawyer
Scout's daughter. Now, I believe Sheepface's wife would
hush up matters, provided you'll consent to the match.
Snarl. Consent! Why, I suppose I must, in order to
save myself from further expense. A very pretty day's
work I have made on't, truly!
Enter Scout, with the bond.
Scout. Here, your worship, I've filled up a bond, in
order that he may sign whatever is agreed to. How d'ye
do, neighbour Snarl?  I always cut my coat--
Snarl. According to mny cloth.
Just. Come, come; sign, sign! (Snarl signs the bond.)
Enter Charles and Sheepface.
Snarl. Heyday! what the plague! are you not dead?
Sheep. No; your worship could never beat such a thing
into my head.
Charles. Dear sir, don't be angry; Sheepface has done
nothing but by my directions; and I hope you will not
only forgive him, but enable me, by your future generosity,
to provide for ourselves henceforward.
Sheep. Do take back one of your best sheep.
Scout. Well, as we have settled our own affairs thus
far, we must now appeal to the tribunal, and humbly ask
their permission for the Village Lawyer to continue in
practice.                                    [Exeunt.

ScENE.- The Duke's Palace.
Enter Campillo, the Duke's Steward, and another Servant.
Serv. BUT can lno one tell the meaning of this fancy?
Camp. No:'tis the duke's pleasure, and that's enough
for us. You shall hear his own words:For reasons, that I shall hereafter communicate, it is
necessary that Jaquez should, in all things, at present,
act as my representative: you will, therefore, command

further from                     (Signed)   ARANZA.
Serv. Well, we must wait the upshot. But how bears
Jaquez his new dignity?
Camp. Like most men in whom sudden fortune combats
against long established habit. (Laughing without.)
Serv. By their merriment, this should be he.
Camp. Stand aside, and let us note him.
Enter Jaquez, dressed as the Duke, followed by six Attendants, who in
vain endeavour to restrain their laughter.
[Exit Servant.
Jaquez. Why, you ragamuffins! what d'ye titter at?
Am I the first great man that has been made off-hand by a
tailor? Show your grinders again, and I'll hang you like
onions, fifty on a rope. I can't think what they see ridiculous about me, except, indeed, that I feel as if I was in
armour, and my sword has a trick of getting between my
legs, like a monkey's tail, as if it was determined to trip up
my nobility. And now, villains! don't let me see you tip
the wink to each other, as I do the honours of my table.
If I tell one of my best stories, don't any of you laugh
before the jest comes out, to show that you have heard it
before: take care that you don't call me by my Christian
name, and then pretend it was by accident; that shall be
transportation at least: and when I drink a health to all
friends, don't fancy that any of you are in the number.
Enter a Servant.
Well, sir?
Serv. There is a lady without, presses vehemently to
speak to your grace.
Jaquez. A lady?
Serv. Yes, your highness.
Jaquez. Is she young?
Serv. Very, your grace!
Jaquez. Handsome?
Serv. Beautiful, your highness!
Jaquez. Send her in.--[Exit Servant.]--You may
retire; I'll finish my instructions by-and-by. Young and
handsome! I'll attend to her business in proprid persona.
Your old and ugly ones I shall despatch by deputy. Now

a country pedagogue, when he enters the school-room
with-a hem! and terrifies the apple-munching urchins
with the creaking of his shoes. I'll swell like a shirt
bleaching in a high wind; and look burly as a Sunday
beadle, when he has kicked down the unhallowed stall of
a profane old apple-woman. Bring my chair of state!
Hush!
Enter Juliana.
Jul. I come, great duke, for justice!
Jaquez. You shall have it.
Of what do you complain?
Jul. My husband, sir!
Jaquez. I'll hang him instantly! What's his offence?
Jul. He has deceived me.
J_aquez. A very common case; few husbands answer
their wives' expectations.
Jul. He has abused your grace.
Jaquez. Indeed! if he has done that, he swings most
loftily. But how, lady, how?
Jul. Shortly thus, sir:
Being no better than a low-born peasant,
He has assumed your character and person.
Enter Duke Aranza.
O! you are here, sir? This is he, my lord.
Jaquez. Indeed! (dside.) Then I must tickle him.
Why, fellow, d'ye take this for an ale-house, that you enter
with such a swagger? Know you where you are, sir?
Duke. The rogue reproves me well! (sside.) I had
forgot.
Most humbly I entreat your grace's pardon,
For this unusher'd visit; but the fear
Of what this wayward woman might allege
Beyond the truthJul. I have spoke naught but truth.
Duke. Has made me thus unmannerly.
Jaquez.'Tis well. You might have used more ceremony.

For the right owner of this sumptuous palace.
Obtain'd my slow consent to be his wife;
And cheated, by this shameful perfidy,
Me of my hopes--my father of his child.
Jaquez. Why, this is swindling; obtaining another
man's goods under false pretences; that is, if a woman be
a good; that will make a very intricate point for the judges.
Well, sir, what have you to say in your defence?
Duke. I do confess I put this trick upon her;
And for my transient usurpation
Of your most noble person, with contrition
I bow me to the rigour of the law.
But for the lady, sir, she can't complain.
Jul. How! not complain? To be thus vilely cozen'd,
Nnd not complain!
Jaquez. Peace, woman! Though Justice be blind, she
is not deaf.
Duke. He does it to the life!              (/side.)
Had not her most exceeding pride been doting,
She might have seen the difference, at a glance,
Between your grace and such a man as I am.
Jaquez. She might have seen that certainly. Proceed.
Duke. Nor did I fall so much beneath her sphere,
Being what I am, as she had soar'd above it
Had I been that which I have only feign'd.
Jaquez. Yet, you deceived her.
Jul. Let him answer that.
Duke. I did: most men in something cheat their wives;
Wives gull their husbands;'tis the course of wooing.
Now, bating that my title and my fortune
Were evanescent, in all other things
I acted like a plain and honest suitor.
I told her she was fair, but very proud;
That she had taste in music, but no voice;
That she danced well, yet stili might borrow grace
From such or such a lady. To be brief;
I praised her for no quality she had not,
Nor over-prized the talents she possess'd:
Now, save in what I have before confess'd,
And I challenge her worst spite to answer me,'Whether, in all attentions, which a woman,
A gentle and a reasonable woman,
422Looks for, I have not to the height fulfill'd,
If not outgone her expectations?
Jaquez. Why, if she has no cause of complaint since
you were marriedDutke. I dare her to the proof on't.
Jaquez. Is it so, woman?             (To Juliana.)
Jul. I don't complain of what has happen'd since;
The man has made a tolerable husband,
But for the monstrous cheat he put upon me,
I claim to be divorced.
Jaquez. It cannot be.
Jul. Cannot, my lord?
Jaquez. No. You must live with him.
Jul. Never!
Duke. Or, if your grace will give me leaveWe have been wedded yet a few short daysLet us wear out a month as man and wife;
If, at the end on't, with uplifted hands,
Morning and evening, and sometimes at noon,
And bended knees, she doesn't plead more warmlyJul. If I do-Duke. Then let her will be done, that seeks to part us.
Jul. I do implore your grace to let it stand
Upon that footing.
Jaquez. Humph! Well, it shall be so; with this proviso,
that either of you are at liberty to hang yourselves in the
mean time. (Rises.)
Duke. We thank your providence. Come, Juliana--
Jul. Well, there's my hand: a month's soon past, and
then
I am your humble servant, sir.
Duke. For ever.
Jul. Nay, I'll be hang'd first.
Duke. That may do as well.
Come, you'll think better on't.

intended for a great man; for what more does it require to
be a great man, than boldly to put on the appearance of it?
How many sage politicians are there, who can scarce comprelend the mystery of a mousetrap; valiant generals, who
wouldn't attack a bulrush, unless the wind were in their
favour; profound lawyers, who would make excellent
wigblocks; and skilful physicians, whose knowledge extends no further than writing death-warrants in Latin; and
are shining examples that a man will never want gold in his
pocket, who carries plenty of brass in his face. It will be
rather awkward, to be sure, to resign at the end of a month:
but, like other great men in office, I must make the most
of my time, and retire with a good grace, to avoid being
turned out; as a well-bred dog always walks down stairs,
when he sees preparations ripe for kicking him into the
street.                                      TOBIN.

Doric. Her name has given me an ague! Dear Saville,
lhow shall I contrive to make old Hardy cancel the engagements! The moiety of the estate, which he will forfeit,
shall be his the next moment by deed of gift.
Sav. Let me see: can't you get it insinuated that you
are a deused wild fellow; that you are an infidel, and
attached to drinking, gaming, and so forth?
Doric. Ay, such a character might have done some good
two centuries back. But who the deuse can it frighten
now? I believe it must be the mad scheme at last. There,
will that do for a grin? (f1ffects madness.)
Sav. Ridiculous! but how are you certain that the
woman who has so bewildered you belongs to Lord
George?
Doric. Flutter told me so.
Sav. Then fifty to one against the intelligence.
Doric. It must be so. There was a mystery in her
manner, for which nothing else can account. (.1 violent
rap.) Who can this be?
Sav. (Looks out.)  The proverb is your answer;'tis
424Flutter himself. Tip him a scene of the madman, and see
how it takes.
Doric. I will; a good way to send it about town. Shall
it be for the melancholy kind, or the raving?
Sav. Rant! rant! Here he comes.
Doric. Talk not to me, who can pull comets by the
beard, and overset an island!
Enter Flutter.
There! This is lie! this is he who hath sent my poor
soul, without coat or breeches, to be tossed about in wether
like a duck-feather! Villain, give me my soul again!

frightened.)

Flut. Adieu; I can't stay. (Going in great haste.)
Sav. But you must stay, (holding him.) and assist me;
perhaps he'll return again in a moment; and when he is
in this way, his strength is prodigious.

ScENE.-Among the hills near the Peruvian camp.
Enter Manco and Almagro..lrm. Ir the gross multitudes see him, thou art lost:
They claim their Inca, and he claims thy head.
/ltanc. I fear not that. They have forgotten him,
Believe him dead, and long have look'd on me
As lord and Inca; and my voice proclaims him
Lunatic and impostor. All the chiefs
Have sworn them mine; and if the people doubt,
They add their voice to his insanity.
They have denounced him such through all the ranks--
He must be silenced ere we meet the Spaniards.
dlm. I'd have it so; or else farewell thy greatness,
And that I look for.
2Manc. Hark to me, Almagro.
The throne I have, thou know'st, it shall be thine,
Make it but mine.
ilm. I understand thee, and remember
Whereto I did consent. But now think better.
His death scares thee: think no more of her.
Her woman's rights are but a feeble reed,
Which thou mayst brush aside. Why shouldst thou crush t
Manc. Is she not daughter of the Incas! Hark!
There be a thousand here, that know, and call her,
Atahualpa's daughter. She will bid them
Behold their Inca in the man we wrong,
And they will listen and believe.
d1im.'Tis true.Let her be prison'd somewhere in the hills,
Beyond the ear of doubters.
Manc. I did think thee
*Wiser than this. There is no place so safe,
But the caged witness of a crime may speak,
Xnd some one catch the echo-none, but one;Dost thou not understand? No place, but one.
They would demand, too, why I dungeon'd her:
426But when I doom her as a blot that shames
The Inca's purity,'tis the Inca's law,
And rightful justice; and all men are silent.--
-The maid must die-and see thou art prepared. (Exit.)
i9lm. And why should I not have it as he wills?
Why weigh the value of a poor maid's life
Against the golden balance of a crown?
Ambition startles not at ghastly blood,
Nor stumbles, conscience-harrow'd, at a corse.
And should the aspiring man, that makes his gain
Of other's hurts, not hurt himself for gain?
Not, when he stabs another for a purse,
Prick his own bosom for a dearer price,
And wound his heart, to laurel-crown his head.
Blossoms of nature, ye should never grow
In hearts that are ambitious; since the tempter
Plucks ye, like weeds, away, till naught takes root,
Save the rough tares of steril selfishness.
Love, pity, friendship, gratitude, away
From such a breast, for ye would make it virtuous;
And, virtue, hence, for ye would keep it lowly.But yet she shall not die.

BIRD.PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
41
12. What is called profane history exhibits our nature on its worst
side: it is the history of perverse passions, of mean self-love, of revenge,
hatred, extravagance, and folly.
13. An ostentatious, a feeble, a harsh, or an obscure style are always
faults; and perspicuity, strength, neatness, and simplicity are beauties
to be always aimed at.
14. Valour, truth, justice, fidelity, friendship, piety, magnanimity, are
the objects which, in the course of epic compositions, are presented to
our mind under the most splendid and honourable colours.
15. To be humble and modest in opinion, to be vigilant and attentive in conduct, to distrust fair appearances, and to restrain rash desires,
are instructions which the darkness of our present state should strongly
inculcate.
16. No blessing of life is any way comparable to the enjoyment of a
discreet and virtuous friend. It eases and unloads the mind, clears and
improves the understanding, engenders thoughts and knowledge, animates virtue and good resolutions, soothes and allays the passions, and
finds employment for most of the vacant hours of life.
17. The time at which the Saviour was to appear-the circumstances
with which his nativity was to be attended-the nature of the kingdom
he was to establish-the power with which he was to be invested, and
the success with which his labours were to be crowned-had been all
prefigured and described, in a manner calculated to excite the liveliest
expectation in the minds of the chosen people.
18. Were we united to beings of a more exalted order,-beings whose
nature raised them superior to misfortune, placed them beyond the reach
of disease and death, who were not the dupes of passion and prejudice,
all of whose views were enlarged, whose goodness was perfected, and
whose spirit breathed nothing but love and friendship,-then would the
evils of which we now complain cease to be felt.
19. All the oriental lustre of the richest gems; all the enchanting
beauties of exterior shape; the exquisite of all forms; the loveliness of
colour; the harmony of sound; the. heat and brightness of the enlivening sun; the heroic virtue of the bravest minds; with the purity
and quickness of the highest intellect; are all emanations from the
supreme Deity.
20. I;conjure you by that which you profess
(Howe'er you come to know it) answer me;
Though you untie the winds, and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature's germins tumble all together,
E'en till destruction sicken, answer me
To what I ask you.             MACBETH, to the Witches.

These marvellous, monstrous jugglings of to-day,

Frown'd on, surrounded, met by clubs and spears,
And bade to call thee Inca? What art thou?

Of perish'd Oralloossa,) now dost force us,
To put restraint upon thee.

Look on my face, and leave thy stolen throne
And sue for pardon, ere I slay thee.

Tell thou mine uncle,'tis the Inca speaks.

For which black deed, the heavens have struck thy brain
Writh this sore madness.
Orall. Talk'st thouz of betraying?
Now can I think that I indeed am mad,T'o think thee hones-t to thy love or me.428Doth no one know me? none of those, for whom
I sold my heritage? What, not thou? nor thou?
Chiefs that have battled at my side, and struck
For Peru and for Oralloossa? Death!
Ye stony traitors, have ye all forsook me?Hark!  Ye Peruvians thronging on the hills,
My children, and my people! look upon me:
I am your Inca, and will ye forsake me?
For ye, I gave my sceptre to mly uncle;
To win ye wisdom, made myself a slave;
To quell your foes, and make ye free and great,
Wrapp'd the pure lustre of my dignity
In a foul cloak of treacherv and lies,
In servile, base and currish occupation,And slew for ye your blood-stain'd conquerors.
Speak forth, Peruvians,-did I do ye this,
And now no more ye know your Inca? Hah!
Are ye all turn'd to stones? What, not one voice,
To bid me welcome to my throne again?
Nay, then'tis true; and I or rave or sleep;
And Oralloossa is a dream. Almagro,
Dost thou remember Ooallie? Bethink thee,
And say thou didst not set them on to this;
Say, thou hast no part in this treachery.
dlm. Then should I lie more deeply than when first
I trapp'd thy soul. Thou devilish villain! thou,
Steep'd to the liver in my father's blood,His friend and viper, his trust and his destroyerBane of his fortunes, and the tool of mine,Will it not smite thy cozen'd heart, to know
I used thee? I enthrall'd thee? and did make thee,
When thou wert wisest, then the most my fool;
When thou wert freest, then the most my slave?
Thou think'st'tis Manco and thy people doom thee:
Be this thy comfort-it is I that do it!
Orall. The thunder sleeps: else should two hot bolts
strike usMe for my madness, thee for thy deceit.
I was very honest with thee, and did mean thee
More, for the Coya's sake, than thou didst dream.

185.---COLONEL ARDEN-RISSOLLE.
Colonel Arden was preparing to take a splendid house in London, and
had ordered his servant to look out for a first-rate cook for his new
establishment. When Rissolle was introduced the colonel was
puzzled to find out what could be his particular profession. He saw
a remarkably gentlemanly-looking man, his well-tied neckcloth, his
well-trimmed whiskers, his white kid gloves, his glossy hat, his massive gold chain, to which was suspended a repeater, all pronouncing
the man of ton; and when the servant announced the ring-figured
gentleman before him as willing to dress a dinner on trial, for the
purpose of displaying his skill, he was thunderstruck.
Col. Do I mistake?     I really beg pardon-it is fiftyeight years since I learned French-am I speaking to aa-cook?
Ris. Oui, monsieur, I believe I have de first reputation
in de profession; I live four years wiz de marquee de
Chester, and Je me flatte dat if I had not turn himn off last
months, I should have supervise his cuisine at dis moment.
Col. 0, you have discharged the marquis, sir?
Ris. Oui, mon col-o-nel, I discharge him because he
cast affront upon me, insupportable to an artist of sentiment.
Col. Artist!
Ris. Mon col-o-nel, de marquee had de mauvais gout,
one day, when he have large partie to dine, to put salt into
de soup, before all de compagnie.
Col. Indeed! and may I ask is that considered a crime,
sir, in your code?
Ris. I don't know cod; you mean morue? dat is salt
enough widout.
Col. I don't mean that, sir.  I ask, is it a crime for a
gentleman to put more salt into his soup?
Ris. Not a crime, mon col-o-nel, mais it would be de
ruin of me, as cook, should it be known to de world. So
I told his lordship I must leave him, for de butler had said,
dat he saw his lordship put de salt into de soup, which was
proclamation to de univairse, dat I did not know de proper
quantite of salt for season my soup.
Col. And you left his lordship for that?
Ris. Oui, sare, his lordship gave me excellent charactair.

man, my lor, of wood family, and very honest man, I believe

Ris. No, mon col-o-nel, it is a fine city, good place--
but no opera.
Col. How shocking! and you left his excellency on
that account?
Ris. Oui, mon col-o-nel.
Col. Why, his excellency managed to live there without
an opera.
Ris. Yes, mon col-o-nel, c'est vrai, but I tink he did not
know dare was none when he took de place. I have de
charactair from my lord to state why I leave him.
Col. And pray, sir, what wages do you expect?
Ris. Wages! Je n'entend pas, mon col-o-nel; do you
mean de stipend-de salarie?
Col. As you please.
Ris. My lord Trefoil give to me seven hundred pounds a
year, my wine, and horse and tilbury, wid small tigre for him.
Col. Small what! sir?
Ris. Tigre-little man-boy to hold de horse.
Col. Ah! seven hundred pounds a year and a tigre!
Ris. Exclusive of de pastry, mon col-o-nel, I never touch
dat department; but I have de honour to recommend Jenkin,
my sister's husband, for de pastry, at five hundred pounds
and his wine. 0, Jenkin is dog a sheap at dat, mon
col-o-nel.
Col. O, exclusive of pastry!
Ris. Oui, mon col-o-nel.
Col. Which is to be obtained for five hundred pounds a
year additional. Why, sir, the rector of my parish, a
clergyman and a gentleman, with an amiable wife and
seven children, has but half that sum to live upon.
Ris. Poor clergie! mon col-o-nel. (Shlrugging his
shoulders.)  I pity your clergie! But den you don't
considare de science and experience dat it require to make
de soup, de omelette--
Col. The mischief take your omelette, sir. Do you
mean seriously and gravely to ask me seven hundred pounds
a year for your services.

of snuff from a'gld snuff-box.)

Whiereby we'll gain the sea, and so pass o'er

Too roughly; but no matter.-Did you send

Steal on the praetor, and so save the army?

Spart. From Phasarius!
Perhaps he is sorry.Enter Jovius.
cEnom. Chief, an embassy
From Crassus.
Spart. And what would Crassus with the Gladiator,
The poor base slave and fugitive, Spartacus?
434Speak, Roman: wherefore does thy master send
Thy gray hairs to the " Cut-throats' " camp?
Jov. Brave rebel,Spart. Why that's a better name than rogue or bondman,
But in this camp I am call'd general.
Jov. Brave general; for though a rogue and bondman
As you have said, I'll still allow you general,
As he that beats a consul surely is.
Spart. Say two, two consuls; and to that e'en add
A pro-consul, three praetors, and some generals.
Jov. Why this is no more thaii true.   Are you a
Thracian?
Spart. Ay.
Jov. There is something in the air of Thrace
Breeds valour up as rank as grass.'Tis pity
You are a barbarian.
Spart. Wherefore?
Jov. Had you been born
A Roman, you had won by this a triumph.
Spart. I thanlk the gods I am barbarian;
For I can better teach the grace-begot
And heaven-supported masters of the eartllh,
How a mere dweller of a desert rock
Can bow their crown'd heads to his chariot wlieels.
Man is heaven's work, and beggars' brats may'herit
A soul to mount them up the steeps of fortune,
With regal necks to be their stepping blocks.But come, what is thy message!
Jov. Julia, niece
O' the praetor, is thy captive.
Spart. Ay.
Jov. For whom
Is offer'd in exchange thy wife, Senona,
And thy young boy.
Spart. Tell thou the praetor, Roman,
The Thracian's wife is ransom'd.
Jov. How is that?
Spart. What ho, Senona!
Senona appears with the child at a tent door.
Lo, she stands before you,
Rainsom'd, and by the steel, from out the camp
Of slaughter'd Gellius.               (Exit Senona.

Jov. This is sorcery!But name a ransome for the general's niece.
Spart. Have I not now the praetor on the hip,
He would, in his extremity, have made
My wife his buckler of defence; perhaps
Have doom'd her to the scourge! but this is Roman.
Now the barbarian is instructed. Look,
I hold the praetor by the heart; and he
Shall feel how tightly grip barbarian fingers.
Jov. Men do not war on women. Name her ransome
Spart. Men do not war on women! Look you.
One day I clomb upon the ridgy top
Of the cloud-piercing H(emus, where, among
The eagles and the thunders, from that height,
I look'd upon the world-as far as where,
Wrestling with storms, the gloomy Euxine chafed
On his recoiling shores; and where dim Adria
In her blue bosom quench'd the fiery sphere.
Between those surges lay a land, might once
Have match'd Elysium, but Rome had made it
A Tartarus.-In my green youth I look'd
From the same frosty peak, where now I stood,
And then beheld the glory of those lands,
Where peace was tinkling on the shepherd's bell
And singing with the reapers;
Since that glad day, Rome's conquerers had past
With withering armies there, and all was changed:
Peace had departed; howling war was there,
Cheer'd on by Roman hunters. Then, methought,
E'en as I look'd upon the alter'd scene,
Groans echo'd through the valleys, through which ran
Rivers of blood, like smoking Phlegethons;
Fires flash'd from burning villages, and famine
Shriek'd in the empty cornfields. Women and children,
Robb'd of their sires and husbands, left to starveThese were the dwellers of the land! Say'st thou
Rome wars not then on women?
Joy. This is not to the matter.
Spart. Now, by Jove,
It is. These things do Romans. But the earth
Is sick of conquerors. There is not a man,
Not Roman, but is Rom:',, esxtremest foe;
436And such am I, sworn from that hour I saw
Those sights of horror, while the gods support me,
To wreak on Rome such havock as Rome wreaks,
Carnage and devastation, wo and ruin.

BIRD --FIELDING.
437PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
HARMONIC INFLECTION.
Besides that variety which necessarily arises from annexing certain
inflections to sentences of a particular import or structure, there is still
another source of variety, in those parts of a sentence where the sense
is not at all concerned, and where the variety is merely to please the ear.
There are many members of sentences which may be differently pronounced without greatly affecting their variety and harmony. It is
chiefly toward the end of a sentence that the harmonic inflection is
necessary in order to form an agreeable cadence.
RULE I.--When a series of similar sentences, or members
of sentences, form a branch of a subject or paragraph,
the last sentence or member must fcall gradually into a
lower tone, and adopt the harmonic inflection, on such
words as form the most agreeable cadence.
EXAMPLE.
Since I have mentioned this unaccountable zeal which
appears in atheists and infidels, I must farther observe, that
they are likewise in a most particular manner possessed with
the spirit of bigotry. They are wedded' to opinions' full
of contradiction' and impossibility', and at the same' time'
look upon the smallest' difficulty' in an article' of faith' as
a sufficient reason for rejecting it.
RULE II.--   zlhen the last member of a sentence ends with
four accented words, the falling inflection takes place on
the first and last, and the rising on the second and third.
EXAMPLES.
1. The immortality of the soul is the basis of morality,
and the source of all the pleasing' hopes' and secret' joys',
that can arise' in the heart' of a reasonable' creature'.
2. A brave' mall struggling' in the storms' of fate',
And greatly' falling' with a falling' state'.
RULE III. WVhen there are three accented words at the
end of the last member, the first has either the rising
or falling, the second the rising, and the last the falling inflection.
EXAMPLE.
Cicero concludes his celebrated books De Oratore, with
some precepts for pronunciation and action, without whichTHE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
Love. Zounds! is the fellow providing an entertainment
for my lord mayor and the court of aldermen?
James. Then a ragoutLove. I'll have no ragout. Would you burst the good
people, you dog?
James. Then pray, sir, say what will you have?
Love. Why, see and provide something to cloy their
stomachs: let there be two good dishes of soup-maigre;
a large suet-pudding; some dainty, fat pork-pie, very fat;
a fine, small lean breast of mutton, and a large dish with two
artichokes. There; that's plenty and variety.
Jcames. O, dearLove. Plenty and variety.
James. But, sir, you must have some poultry.
Love. No; I'll have none.
James. Indeed, sir, you should.
Love. Well, then,--kill the old hen, for she has done
laying.
James. Mercy! sir, how the folks will talk of it;
indeed, people say enough of you already.
Love. Eh! why what do the people say, pray?
James. Ah, sir, if I could be assured you would not be
angry.
Love. Not at all; for I'm always glad to hear what the
world says of me.
James. Why, sir, since you will have it then, they Inake
a jest of you everywhere; nay, of your servants, on
your account. One says, you pick a quarrel with them
quarterly, in order to find an excuse to pay them no wages.
Love. Poh! poll!
James. Another says, you were taken one night stealing
your own oats from your own horses.
Love. That must be a lie; for I never allow them any.

Pleading in broken words and piercing shrieks,
And hoarse, low shivering sobs, the very cry
Of nature! And when I at last said noFor I said no to her--she flung herself

To pull a sinewy tyrant from his seat,
And from their chains a prostrate people lift
To liberty. I'd be content to die,
Living to see that day! What, Albert!

My father!

Too fast.                  (dlbert continues shooting.)

How often have you hit the mark to-day?.Alb. Not once, yet.
Tell. You're not steady. I perceived
Yoiu waver'd now. Stand firm. Let every limb
Be braced as marble, and as motionless.
Stand like the sculptor's statue, on the gate
Of Altorf, that looks life, yet neither breathes
Nor stirs. (3lbert shoots.) That's better!
See well the mark. Rivet your eye to it!
There let it stick, fast as the arrow would,
Could you but send it there.           (albert shoots.)
You've miss'd again! How would you fare,
Suppose a wolf should cross your path, and you
Alone, with but your bow, and only time
To fix a single arrow?'Twould not do
To miss the wolf! You said, the other day,
Were you a man, you'd not let Gesler live-'Twas easy to say that. Suppose you, now,
Your life or his depended on that shot!Take care! That's Gesler!-Now for liberty!

ECHO
Is here used to express that repetition of a word or thought, which
immediately arises from a word or thought that preceded it.
RULE.--The echoing word ought always to bepronounced
with the rising inflection in a high tone of voice, and
a long pause after it, when it implies any degiree oj
passion.*
EXAMPLES.
1. Newton was a Christian! Newton'! whose mind burst
forth from the fetters cast by nature on our finite conceptions--Newton'! whose science was truth, and the foundation of whose knowledge of it was philosophy; not those
visionary and arrogant presumptions which too often usurp its
name, but philosophy resting on the basis of mathematics,
which, like figures, cannot lie--Newton'! who carried the
line and rule to -the utmost barrier of creation, and explored the principles by which, no doubt, all created matter
is held together and exists.
2. With " mysterious reverence" I forbear to descant on

point' in which the wise and the weak, the learned and

This monotone may be defined to be a continuation or sameness
of sound upon certain syllables of a word, exactly like that produced
by repeatedly striking a bell;-such a stroke may be louder or softer,

The tempest growls; but, as it nearer comes,
And rolls its awful burden on the wind,

ACCENT.
I JLE.-Emphasis requires       a transposition   of  accent
when two words which have a sameness in part of their
foirmation, are opposed to each other in sense.
EXAMPLES.
1. What is done', cannot be un'done.*
Z. There is a material difference between giv'ing and
ft rIgiving.
J. Thought and language act' and relact upon each

6. The riches of the prince must in'crease or de'crease
in piroportion to the number and riches of his subjects.
* Tfhe signs (' and'), besides denoting the inflections, mark also the
accented syllables.
Whiatever inflection be adopted, the accented syllable is always
louder than the rest; but if the accent be pronounced with the rising
inflection, the accented syllable is higher than the preceding, and lowel
than the succeeding syllable; and if the accent have the falling inflection, the accented syllable is pronounced higher than any other syllable,
either pi ceding or succeeding.
46PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
7. Relig'ion raises men above themselves; ir'religion
sinks them beneath the brutes.
8. I shall always miake reason, truth, and nature, the
measures of praise' and dis'praise.
9. Whatever conve'nience may be thought to be in falsehood and dissimnulation, it is soon over; but the in'convenience of it is perpetual.
10.':The sense of an author being the first object of reading, it will be necessary to inquire into those divisi'ons
and sub'divisions of a sentence, which are employed to fix
and ascertain its meaning.
11. This corruip'tible must put onin'corruption, and this

to the cause or object which excites it, consist the propri'ety
or irn'propriety, the decency or ungracefulness of the consequent action.
14. He that compares what he has done' with what he
has left un'done, will feel the effect which must always
follow the comparison of imagination with reality.
Note 1.-This transposition of the accent extends itself to all words
which have a sameness of termination, though they may not be directly
opposite in sense.
EXAMPLES.
1. In this species of composition, plau'sibility is much
more essential than problability.'2. Lucius Catiline was expert in all the arts of sim'ulation
and dis'simulation; covetous of what belonged to others,
lavish of his own.
NTote 2.-When the accent is on the last syllable of a word which has
no emphasis, it must be pronounced louder and a degree lower than the
rest.

1845.fm15             PRINCIPLES OF ELOCIUTION.
EMPHASIS
Is that stress we lay on words which are in contradistinction to other
words expressed or understood. And hence will follow this general
rule: 7Vherever there is contradistinction in the sense of the words,
there oztg'lt to be emnphasis in the pronunciation of them.
All words are pronounced either with emphatic force, accented force,
or unaccented force; this last kind of force may be called by the name
of feebleness. When the words are in contradistinction to other wor(s,
or to some sense implied, they may be called emphatic; where they do not
denote contradistinction, and yet are more important than the particles,
they may be called accented, and the particles and lesser words may be
called sznaccented or feeble.
EXAMPLES.
1. Exercise and tenmperance strengthen the constitution.
2. Exercise and tenmperance strengthen even an INDIFFERENT constitution.
The word printed in Roman capitals is pronounced with emphatic
force; those in small Italics are pronounced with accented force; the
rest with sunaccented force.
Emphasis always implies antithesis; when this antithesis is agreeable
to the sense of the author, the emphasis is proper; but where there is no
antithesis in the thought, there ought to be none on the words; because,
whenever an emphasis is placed upon an improper word, it will suggest
an antithesis, which either does not exist, or is not agreeable to the sense
and intention of the writer.
The best method to find the emphasis in these sentences, is to take the
word we suppose to be emphatical, and try if it will admit of these words
being supplied which an emphasis on it would suggest; if, when these
words are supplied, we find them not only agreeable to the meaning of
the writer, but an improvement of his meaning, we may pronounce the
word emphatical; but if these words we supply are not agreeable to the
meaning of the words expressed, or else give them an-affected and fanciful
meaning, we ought by no means to lay the emphasis upon them.
EXAMPLE.
3. A man of a polite imagination is led into a great many
pleasures that the vulgar are not capable of receiving; he
can converse with apicture, and find an agreeable companion
in a statue.
In this sentence an emphasis on the word picture is not only an advantage to the thought, but is in some measure necessary to it: for it hints
to the minhd, that a polite imagination does not only find pleasure in
conversing with those objects which give pleasure to all, but with those
which give pleasure to such only as can converse with them.
All emphasis has an antithesis either expressed or understood: if the
emphasis excludes the antithesis, the emphatic word has the fallingPRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
inflection: if the emphasis does not exclude the antithesis, the emphatic
word has the rising inflection. The distinction between the two emphatic inflections is this: The falling inflection affirms something in the
emphasis, and denies what is opposed to it in the antithesis, while the
emphasis with the rising inflection affirms something in the emphasis
without denying what is opposed to it in the antithesis: the former,
therefore, from its affirming and denying absolutely, may be called the
strong emphasis; and the latter, from its affirming only; and not denying, may be called the weak emphasis.-We have an instance of the
strong emphasis and falling inflection on the words despite and fear, in
the following sentence, where Richard the Third rejects the proposal of
the Duke of Norfolk to pardon the rebels.
4. Why that, indeed, was our sixth Harry's way,
Which made his reign one scene of rude commotion:
I'll be in men's despite' a monarch; no,
Let kings thatfear' forgive; blows and revenge
For me.
The paraphrase of these words, when thus emphatical, would be, Ill
be, not in men's favour, but in their despite, a monarch-and let inot me,
who am fearless, but kings that fear, forgive.-The weak emphasis,
with the rising inflection, takes place on the word man in the following
example from the FAIR PENITENT, where Horatio, taxing Lothario
with forgery, says,
5.'Twas base and poor, unworthy of a man',
To forge a scroll so villanous and loose,
And mark it with a noble lady's name.
If this emphasis were paraphrased, it would run thus:'Twas base and
poor, unworthy of a man, though not unwoorthy of a brute.
The first of the following examples is an instance of the single emphasis implied; the second, of the single emphasis expressed; the third,
of the double emphasis; and the fourth, of the treble emphasis.*
1. Exercise and temperance strengthen even an indifferent' constitution.
2. You were paid to Jight' against Alexander, and not
to rail' at him.
3. The pleasures of the imagination are not so gross' as
those of sense', nor so refined' as those of the understanding'.
* In these examples of emphasis the emphatic word alone is printed
in italics; the marks above them denote the inflections.
5
49PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
4. He' raised a mortal' to the skies',
She' drew an angel' down'.
SINGLE EMPHASIS..*
RULE.-When a sentence is composed of a positive and
negative part, the positive must have the falling, and the
negative the rising inflection.t
EXAMPLES.
1. We can do nothing against' the truth, but for' the
truth.
2. None more impatiently suffer' injuries, than they who
are most forward in doing' them.
3. You were paid tofight' against Alexander, and not to
rail' at him.
4. Hunting (and men', not beasts') shall be his game,
5. Caesar, who would not wait the conclusion of the
consul's speech, generously replied, that he came into Italy,
not to injure' the liberties of Rome and its citizens, but to
restore' them.
6. If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for
our sins; and not for ours' only, but also for the sins of
the whole world'.
7. Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
on us, that we should be called the sons of God! therefore
the world knoweth us' not, because he knew him' not.
8. It is not the business of virtue to extirpate' the affections of the mind, but to regulate' them.
9. It may moderate and restrain', but was not designed to
banish' gladness from the heart of man.
10. Those governments which curb' not evils, cause'!
And a rich knave's a libel on our laws.
11. For if you pronounce, that, as my public conduct
* When two emphatic words in antithesis with each other are either
expressed or implied, the emphasis is said to be single.
t To this rule, however, there are some exceptions, not only in poetry,
but also in prose.

hath not been right, Ctesiphon must stand condemned, it
must be thought that yourselves' have acted wrong, not that
you owe your present state to the caprice offortune'. But
it cannot be.  No, my countrymen! it cannot be you have
acted wrong, in encountering danger bravely, for the liberty
and safety of Greece'. No! by those generous souls of
ancient times, who were exposed at Marathon'!     by those
who stood arrayed at Plateaa'! by those who encountered
the Persian fleet at Salamis'! who fought at flrtemisium'!
By all those illustrious sons of Athens, whose remains lie
deposited in the public monuments'!   All of whom received
the same honourable interment from     their country: Not
those only who prevailed', not those only who were victorious'.  And with reason.    What was the part of gallant
men they all performed; their success was such as the
Supreme Director of the world dispensed to each.
t' Note.-When two objects are compared, the comparative word has
the strong emphasis and falling inflection, and the word compared has
the weak emphasis and rising inflection.
EXAIPLES.
1.           It is a custom
More honour'd in the breach' than the observance'.
2. I would die' sooner than mention it.
DOUBLE EMPHASIS.t
RULE.-The falling inflection takes place on the first
emphatic word, the rising on the second and third, and
thefalling on the fourth.T
EXAMPLES.
1. To err' is human'; toforgive' divine'.
2. Custom is the plague' of wise' men, and the idol' of
fools'.
* This is the case when it is the intention of the speaker to declare
with emphasis, the priority or preferableness of one thing to another.
t When two words are opposed to each other, and contrasted with
two other words, the emphasis on these four words may be called
double.
* The pause after the second emphatic word must be considerab,
longer than that after the first or third.
51PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
3. The prodligal' robs his heir', the miser' robs himself'
4. TVe' are weak', and ye' are strong'.
5. Without' were fightings', within' werefears'.
6. Business' sweetens pleasure', as labour' sweetens
rest'.
7. Prosperity' gains' friends, and adversity' tries' them.
8 The wise' man considers what he zoants', and the
fool' what he abounds' in.
9. One' sun by day'-by night' ten thousand' shine.
10. Justiceappropriates honours' to virtue', and reuwards'
to merit'.
11. Justice' seems most agreeable to the nature of God',
and mercy' to that of man'.
12. It is as great a point of wisdom to hide' ignorance',
as to discover' knowledge'.
13. As it is the part of justice' never to do violence', it
is of modesty' never to commit offence'.
14. If men of eminence are exposed to censure' on one'
hand, they are as much liable to flattery' on the other'.
15. The wise' man is happy when he gains his own' approbation, and thefool' when he recommends himself to
the applause of those about' him.
16. We make provision for this' life as though it were
never to have an end', and for the other' life as though it
were never to have a beginning'.
17. Alfred seemed born not only to defend' his bleeding
country', but even to adorn' humanity'.
18. His care was to polish' the country by arts', as he
had protected' it by arms'.
19. Yielding to immoral' pleasure corrupts' the mind,
living to animal and tr,fling' ones debases' it.
20. Grief is the counter passion of joy. The one' arises
from agreeable', and the other' from dis'agreeable events,the one' from pleasure', and the other' from pain',-the one'
from good', and the other' from evil'.
21. Fools' anger show', which politicians' hide'.
22. The foulest stain and scandal of our nature
Became its boast.  One' murder makes a villain',
52PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION
Millions' a hero'.  WVar' its thousands' slays,
Peace' its ten' thousands.
23.           In arms opposed,
Marlborough and Alexander vie for fame
With glorious competition; equal both
In valour and in fortune: but their praise
Be different, for with different views they fought;
This' to stubdue', and that' tofree' mankind.'
TREBLE EMPHASIS.t
RULE.--The rising inflection takesplace on the first and
third, and the falling on the second of the first three
emp hatical words; the first and third of the other
three have thefalling, and the second has the rising
inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. Afriend' cannot be known' in prosperity'; and an
enemy' cannot be hidden' in adversity'.
2. Flowers of rhetoric in sermons or serious discourses
are like the blue and red flowers in corn, pleasing' to those'
who come only for amusement', but prejuzdicial' to him'
who would reap the profit'.
3. Man is a creature designed for two different states of
being, or, rather, for two different lives. The first' life is
short' and transient'; his second', permanent' and lasting'.
4. The difference between a madman and a fool is, that
the former' reasons justly', from false' data; and the latter'
erroneously', from just' data.
5. He' raised a mortal' to the skies',
She' drew an angel' down'.
6. Passions' are winds' to urge us o'er the wave,,
Reason' the rudder', to direct and save';
* Though some of the examples under the head of emphasis are not
strictly emphatical, yet the Words marked as such will show how simi
larly constructed sentences may be read.
t When three emphatic words are opposed to three other emphatic
words in the same sentence, the emphasis is called treble.
5-,
53PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
7. This' without those' obtains a vain' employ,
Those' without this', but urge us to destroy'.
8. The generous buoyant spirit is a power
Which in the virtuous mind doth all things conquer.
It bears' the hero' on to arduous' deeds:
It lifts' the saint' to heaven'.
Note.-In the following examples the treble emphasis, though not
expressed, is evidently implied.
EXXA-PLES.
1. To reign is worth ambition, though in hell;
Better to reign' in hell' than serve' in heaven'.
2. I would rather be thefirst' man in that villctge than the second'
in Rome'.
THE ANTECEDENT.
RULE.--Personal or adjective pronouns, when antecedents, must be pronounced with an accentualforce, to
intimate that the Xrelative is in view, and in some measure to anticipate the pronunciation of it.
EXAMPLES.
1. He, that pursues fame with just claims, trusts h;s
happiness to the winds; but he, that endeavours after it by
false merit, has to fear, not only the violence of the storm,
but the leaks of his vessel.
2. The weakest reasoners are always the most positive
in debate; and the cause is obvious; for they are unavoidabiy driven to maintain their pretensions by violence, who
want arguments and reasons to prove that they are in the
right.
3. A man will have his servant just, diligent, sober, and
chaste, for no other reason but the terror of losing his master's favour, when all the laws divine and human cannot
keep him whom    he serves within bounds, with relation to
any one of these virtues.
4. And greater sure my merit, who, to gain
A point sublime, could such a task sustain.
54PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
RULE   II.-When     the trelative  only  is  expressed, the
antecedent being understood, the accentualforce then
falls upon the relative.
EXAMPLES,.
1.'hat nothing earthly gives, or can destroy,
The soul's calm sunshine, and the heartfelt joy,
Is virtue's prize.
2. PWho noble ends by noble means obtains,
Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains,
Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed
Like Socrates, that man is great indeed.
GENERAL EMPHASIS
Is that emphatic force, which, when the composition is very animated, and approaches to a close, we often lay upon several words in
succession. This emphasis is not so much regulated by the sense of the
author, as by the taste and feelings of the reader, and therefore does
not admit of any certain rule.
EXAMPLES.
1.            What men could do
Is done already: heaven and earth will witness,
If Rome' must' fall', that we are innocent.
2. There was a time, then, my fellow citizens, when
the Lacedaemonians were sovereign masters both by sea

and the other islands, while this state had not one ship,
not' one' wall'.
In these examples, if the words marked as emphatic are pronounced
with the proper inflections, and with a distinct pause after each, it is
inconceivable the force that will be given to these few words. This
general emphasis, it may be observed, has identity for its object, the
antithesis to which is appearance, similitude, or the least possible diversity.
THE INTERMEDIATE OR ELLIPTICAL MEMBER
Is that part of a sentence which is equally related to both parts of aa
antithesis, but which is properly only once expressed.

1. Must we, in your person, crown' the author of-the
public calamities, or must we destroy' him?
2. A good man will love himself too well to lose' an
estate by gaming, and his neighbour too well to win' one.
In the above examples, the elliptical members, "the author of the
public calamities," and "an estate by gaming,"-are pronounced with
the rising inflection, but with a higher and feebler tone of voice than the
antithetic words crown and lose.*
In the two following examples, the elliptical members, which are immediately after the last two antithetic words win and brain, are pronounced with the falling inflection, but in a lower tone of voice than
these words.
EXAMPLES.
3. A good man will love himself too well to lose', and
his neighbour too well to win', an estate by gaming.
4. It would be in vain to inquire, whether the power of
imagining things strongly proceeds from any greater perfection in the soul', or from any nicer texture in the brain',
of one man than of another.
When the intermediate member contains an emphatical word, or extends to any length, it will be necessary to consider it as an essential
member of the sentence, and to pronounce it with emphasis and variety.

6. A stream that runs within its banks is a beautiful object; but
when it rushes down with the impetuosity and noise of a torrent, it

7. Though rules and instructions cannot do all that is requisite, they
may, however, do much that is of real use. They cannot, it is true,
inspire genius; but they can direct and assist it. They cannot remedy
barrenness: but they carl correct redundancy.
8. A French sermon is, for the most part, a warm animated exhortation; an English one is a piece of cool instructive reasoning.  The
French preachers address themselves chiefly to the imagination and the
passions; the English, almost solely to the understanding.
9. No person- can imagine that to be a frivolous and contemptible art,
which has been employed by writers under divine inspiration, and has
been chosen as a proper channel for conveying to the world the knowledge of divine truth.
10. The tastes of men may differ very considerably as to their object,
anid yet none of them be wrong. One man relishes poetry most; another takes pleasure in nothing but history. One prefers comedy; another, tragedy. One admires the simple; another, the ornamented style.
The young are amused with gay and sprightly compositions; the elderly
are more entertained with those of a graver cast. Some nations delight
in bold pictures of manners, and strong representations of passions;
others incline to more correct and regular elegance both in description
and sentiment. Though all differ, yet all pitch upon some one beauty
which peculiarly suits their turn of mind; and, therefore, no one has a
title to condemn the rest.
11. Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face:
His eyes do drop no tears; his prayers are jest;
His words come from his mouth; ours, from our i;rast;
He prays but faintly, and would be denied;

12. Two principles in human nature reign;
Self-love to urge, and reason to restrain;
Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call;
Each works its end, to move or govern all.
13. See the sole bliss Heaven could on all bestow,
Which who but feels can taste, but thinks can know:
Yet poor with fortune, and with learning blind,
The bad must miss; the good untaught will find

The good man has his clouds that intervene;
Clouds that may dim his sublunary day,
But cannot darken: even the best must own,
Patience and resignation are the pillea:s
Of human peace on earth.

RHETORICAL PAUSES.
RULE I.--Pause after the nominative when it consists of
more than one word.*
EXAMPLES.
1. The fashion of thisworld passeth away.
2. To practise virtue is the sure way to love it.
3. The pleasures and honours of the world to come are,
in the strictest sense of the word, ev-erlasting.
Note 1.--A pause may be made after a nominative, even when it
consists of only one word, if it be a word of importance, or if we wish
it to be particularly observed.
EXAMPLES.
1. Adversity is the school of piety.
2. The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.
Note 2.--When a sentence consists of a nominative and' a verb, each
expressed in a single word, no pause is necessary.
EXAMPLES.
1. George learns.-2. The boys read.-3. The tree grows.--4. He comes.
RULE II.--When any member comes between the nominative case and the verb, it must be separatedfrom      both
of them by a short pause.
EXAMPLES.
1. Trials in this state of being are the lot of man.
* The place of the pause is immediately before each of the words
printed in italics.
58PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
2. Such is the constitution of men, that virtue however
it may be neglected for a time will ultimately be acknowledged and respected.
RULE III.--When any member comes between the verb and
the objective or accusative case, it must be separated
from both of them by a short pause.
EXAMPLE.
I knew a person who possessed the faculty of distinguishing flavours in so great a perfection, that, after having
tasted ten different kinds of tea, he would distinguish without seeing the colour of it the particular sort which was
offered him.
RULE IV.-W-hen two verbs come together, and the latter
is in the infinitive mood, if any words come between,
they must be separated from the latter verb by a pause.
EXAMPLE.
Whether'tis nobler'in the mind to suffer'T'he stings and arrows of outrageous fortune;
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them?
Note.-When the verb to be is followed by a verb in the infinitive
mood, which may serve as a nominative case to it, and the phrases before
and after the verb may be transposed, then the pause falls betweeli the
verbs.
EXAMPLE.
The greatest misery is to be condemned by our own hearts.
RULE V.---When several substantives become the nominative to the same verb, a pause must be made between the
last substantive and the verb, as well as after each of the
other substantives.
EXAMPLE.
Riches, pleasure, and health become evils to those who do
not know how to use them.
59PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
RULE VI.-If there are several adjectives belonging to one
substantive, or several substantives belonging to one
adjective, every adjective coming after its substantive,
and every adjective coming before the substantive except
the last, must be separated by a short pause.*
EXAMPLES.
1. It was a calculation accurate to the last degree.
2. A behaviour active supple and polite, is necessary to
succeed in life.
3. The idea of an eternal uncaused Being, forces itself
upon the reflecting mind.
4. Let but one brave great active disinterested man arise,
and he will be received, followed, and venerated.
Note.--This rule applies also to sentences in which several adverbs
belong to one verb, or several verbs to one adverb.
EXAMPLES..To love wisely rationally and prudently, is, in the opinion of
lovers, not to love at all.
2. Wisely rationally and prudently to love, is, in the opinion of
lovers, not to love at all.
RULE VII.-Whatever words are in the ablative absolute,
must be separatedfrom the rest by a short pause both
before and after them.
EXAMPLES.
1. If a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt
or die the owner thereof not being with it he shall surely
make it good.
2. God, from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top
Shall tremble he descending vill himself
In thunder, lightnings, and loud tempests' sound
Ordain them laws.
* No pause is admitted between the substantive and the adjective in,he inverted order, when the adjective is single, or unaccompanied by
adjuncts. Thus, in this line,They guard with arms divine the British thronethe adjective divine cannot be separated by a pause from the substan
tive arms.
60PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
RULE VIII.-Nouns in opposition, or words in the same
case, where the latter is only explanatory of the former,
have a short pause between them, either if both these
nouns consist of many terms, or the latter only.
EXAMPLES.
1. Hope the balm of'life, soothes us under every misfortune.
2. Solomon the son of David and the builder of the
temple of Jerusalem, was the richest monarch that reigned
over the Jewish people.
NTote.-If the two nouns are single, no pause is admitted; as, Paul
the apostle; King George; the Emperor Alexander.
RULE IX.--Then two substantives come together, and the
latter, which is in the genitive case, consists of several
words closely united. with each other, a pause is admissible between the two principal substantives.
EXAMPLE.
I do not know whether I am singular in my opinion, but,
for my own part, I would rather look upon a tree in all its
luxuriancy, and diffusion of boughs and branches, than
when it is cut and trimmed into a mathematical figure.
RULE X.-Who, which, when in the nominative case, and
the pronoun that, when usedfor who or which, require
a short pause before them.
EXAMPLES.
1. Death is the season which brings our affections to the
test.
2. Nothing is in vain that rouses the soul; nothing in
vain that keeps the ethereal fire alive and glowing.
3. A man calln never be obliged to submit to any power,
unless' he can be satisfied who is the person who has a
right to exercise it.
Note.-There are several words usually called adverbs, which include
in them the power of the relative pronoun, and will therefore admit of
a pause before them; such as, when, why, wherefore, how, where,
6
61whether, whither, whence, while, till or until: for when is equivalent to
the time at which; why or wherefore is equivalent to the reason for
which; and so of the rest. It must, however, be noted, that when a
preposition comes before one of these relatives, the pause is before the
preposition; and that, if any of these words is the last word of the sentence or clause of a sentence, no pause is admitted before it: as, " I have
read the book, of which I have heard so much commendation, but I
know not the reason why. I have heard one of the books much commended, but I cannot tell which," &amp;c.
It must likewise be observed, that, if the substantive which governs
the relative, and makes it assume the genitive case, comes before it, no
pause is to be placed either before which, or the preposition that
governs it.
EXAIMPLE.
The passage of the Jordan is a figure of baptism,- by the grace of
which the new-born Christian passes from the slavery of sin into a
state of freedom peculiar to the chosen sons of God.
RULE XI.--Pause before that, when it is usedfor a
conjunction.
EXAMPLE.
It is in society only that we can relish those pure delicious joys which embellish and gladden the life of man.
RULE XII.--When a pause is necessary at prepositions
and conjunctions, it must be before and not after them.
EXAMPLES.
1. We must not conform to the world in their amusements and diversions.
2. There is an inseparable connexion between piety and
virtue.
Note 1.-When a clause comes between the conjunction and the
word to which it belongs, a pause may. be made both before and after
the conjunction.
EXA3IPLE.
This let him know,
Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend
Surprisal.
Note 2.-When a preposition enters into the composition of a verb,
Ihe pause comes after it.

much below, the ordinary standard of human nature.
2. Whenever words are contrasted with, contradistinguishedfrom, or opposed to, other words, they are always
emphatical.
As those classes of words, which admit of no separation, are very
small and very few, if we do but take the opportunity of pausing where
the sense will permit, we shall never be obliged to break in upon the
sense when we find ourselves under the necessity of pausing; but if
we overshoot ourselves by pronouncing more in a breath than is necessary, and neglecting those intervals where we may pause conveniently,
we shall often find ourselves obliged, to pause where the sense is not
separable, and, consequently, to weaken and obscure the composition.
This observation, for the sake of the memory, may be conveniently
comprised in the following verses:
In pausing, ever let this rule take place,
Never to separate words in any case
That are less separable than those you join:
And, which imports the same, not to combine
Such words together, as do not relate,
So closely as the words you separate.

RULES FOR READING VERSE.
On the Slides or Inflections of Verse.
1. THE first general rule for reading verse is, that we
ought to give it that measured harmonious flow of sound
which distinguishes it from prose, without falling into a
bombastic, chanting pronunciation, which makes it ridiculous.
2. It will not be improper, before we read verse with its
poetical graces, to pronounce it exactly as if it were prose:
this will be depriving verse of its beauty, but will tend to
preserve it from deformity: the tones of voice will be
frequently different, but the inflections will be nearly the
same.
3. But though an elegant and harmonious pronunciation
of verse will sometimes oblige us to adopt different inflections from those we use in prose, it may still be laid down
as a good general rule, that verse requires the same inflections as prose, though less strongly marked, and more
approaching to monotones.
4. Wherever a sentence, or member of a sentence, would
necessarily require the falling inflection in prose, it ought
always to have the same inflection in poetry; for though,
if we were to read verse prosaically, we should often place
the falling inflection where the style of verse would require
the rising, yet in those parts where a portion of perfect
sense, or the conclusion of a sentence, necessarily requires
the falling inflection, the same inflection must be adopted
both in verse and prose.
5. In the same manner, though we frequently suspend
6*
65PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
the voice by the rising inflection in verse, where, if the
composition were prose, we should adopt the falling, yet,
wherever in prose the member or sentence would necessa
rily require the rising inflection, this inflection must necessarily be adopted in verse.
6. It may be observed, indeed, that it is in the frequent
use of the rising inflection, where prose would adopt the
falling, that the song of poetry consists; familiar, strong,
argumnentativre subjects naturally enforce the language with
the falling inflection, as this is naturally expressive of activity, force, and precision; but grand, beautiful, and plaintive
subjects slide naturally into the rising inflection, as this is
expressive of awe, admiration, and melancholy, where the
mind may be said to be passive; and it is this general tendency of the plaintive tone to assume the rising inflection
which inclines injudicious readers to adopt it at those pauses
where the falling inflection is absolutely necessary, and for
want of which the pronunciation degenerates into the whine,
so much and so justly disliked; for it is very remarkable,
that if, where the sense concludes, we are careful to preserve the falling inflection, and let the voice drop into the
natural talking tone, the voice may be suspended in the
rising inflection on any other part of the verse, with very
little danger of falling into the chant of bad readers.
On the.ccent and Emphasis of Verse.
In verse, every syllable must have the same accent, and
every word the same emphasis, as in prose.
In words of two syllables, however, when the poet transposes the accent from the second syllable to the first, we
may comply with him, without occasioning any harshness
in the verse;-but when, in such words, he changes the
accent from thefirst to the second syllable, every reader who
has the least delicacy of feeling will certainly preserve the
common accent of these words on the first syllable.
In misaccented words of three syllables, perhaps the least
offensive method to the ear of preserving the accent, and
not entirely violating the quantity, would be to place an
accent on the syllable immediately preceding that on which
66PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.               ti,
the poet has misplaced it, without dropping that which is
so misplaced.
The same rule seems to hold good where the poet has
placed the accent on the first and last syllable of a word,
which ought to have it on the middle syllable.
Where a word admits of some diversity in placing the
accent, it is scarcely necessary to observe, that the verse
ought in this case to decide.
But when the poet has with great judgment contrived
that his numbers shall be harsh and grating, in order to
correspond with the ideas they suggest, the common
accentuation must be preserved.
How the Vowelse and o are to bepronounced, when apostrophized.
The vowel e, which in poetry is often cut off by an apostrophe in the word the and in unaccented syllables before r,
as dang'rous, gen'rous, &amp;c. ought always to be preserved
in pronunciation, because the syllable it forms is so short
as to admit of being sounded with the succeeding syllable,
so as not to increase the number of syllables to the ear, or
at least to hurt the melody.
I'he same observations, in every respect, hold good in
the pronunciation of the preposition to, which ought always
to be sounded long, like the adjective twvo, however it may
be printed.
On the Pause or Cassura of Verse.
Almost every verse admits of a pause in or near the
middle of the line, which is called the caesura; this must be
carefully observed in reading verse, or much of the distinctness, and almost all the harmony, will be lost.
Though the most harmonious place for the capital pause
is after the fourth syllable, it may, for the sake of expressing
the sense strongly and suitably, and even sometimes for the
sake of variety, be placed at several other intervals.
The end of a line in verse naturally inclines us to pause;
and the words that refuse a pause so seldom occur at the
end of a verse, that we often pause between words in versePREFACE.
THE importance of Elocution as a distinct branch
of instruction, is too well understood at the present
day to render any apology necessary for offering a
new work on the subject. Eloquence is one of the
chief instruments of political distinction, as well as
one of the most efficient aids in advancing the cause
of moral and religious improvement. How necessary
a correct and tasteful elocution is to the education of an
orator, is obvious on the slightest reflection. If it is
true that some remarkable men have won their way
to distinction as orators, without carefully studying the
principles of elocution, it is not less true that their way
would have been smoother, and their difficulties fewer,
if they had afforded themselves this auxiliary; while
with the great mass of aspirants for this sort of eminence, a course of instruction in elocution is a matter
of absolute necessity.
Impressed with this view of the subject, I have prefixed to the following collection of pieces for declamation and reading, the whole of Mr. Ewing's Principles
of Elocution, and a considerable number of pieces
A2                5PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
where we should not in prose, but where a pause would by
nio means interfere with the sense. This, perhaps, may be
the reason why a pause at the end of a line in poetry is
supposed to be in compliment to the verse, when tile very
same pause in prose is allowable, and perhaps eligible, but
neglected as unnecessary: however this be, certain it is,
that if we pronounce many lines in Milton, so as to make
the equality of impressions on the ear distinctly perceptible
at thle end of every line; if, by making this pause, we make
the pauses that mark the sense less perceptible, we
exchange a solid advantage for a childish rhythm, and, by
endeavouring to preserve the name of verse, lose all its
meaning and energy.
On the Cadence of Verse.
In order to form a cadence at a period in rhyming verse,
we must adopt the falling inflection with considerable force
in the caesura of the last line but one.
How to pironounce a Simrile in Poetry.
A simile in poetry ought always to be read in a lower
tone of voice than that part of the passage which precedes it.
This rule is one of the greatest embellishments of poetic
pronunciation, and is to be observed no less in blank verse
than in rhyme.
General Rules.
Where there is no pause in the sense at the end of a
verse, the last word must have exactly the same inflection
it would have in prose.
Sublime, grand, and magnificent description in poetry
requires a lower tone of voice, and a sameness nearly
approaching to a monotone.
When the first line of a couplet does not form perfect
sense, it is necessary to suspend the voice at the end of the
line with the rising slide.PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
This rule holds good even where the first line forms
perfect sense by itself, and is followed by another formiing
perfect sense likewise, provided the first line does not end
with all emphatic word wvhich requires the falling slide.
But if the first line ends with an emphatical word requiring the falling slide, this slide must be given to it, but in a
higher tone of voice than the same slide in the last line of
the couplet.
When the first line of a couplet does not form sense, and
the second line, either from its not forming sense, or from
its being a question, requires the rising slide; in this case,
the first line must end with such a pause as the sense
requires, but without any alteration in the tone of the
voice.
In the same manner, if a question requires the second
line of the couplet to adopt the rising slide, the first ought
to have a pause at the end; but the voice, without any
alteration, ought to carry on the same tone to the second
line, and to continue this tone almost to the end.
The same principles of harmony and variety induce us to
read a triplet with a sameness of voice, or a monotone, on
the end of the first line, the rising slide on the end of the
second, and the falling on the last.
This rule, however, from the various sense of the triplet, is
liable to many exceptions.--But, with very few exceptions,
it may be laid down as a rule, that a quatracin or stanza
of four lines of alternate verse, may be read with the monotone ending the first line, the rising slide ending the second
and third, and the falling the last.
The plaintive tone, so essential to the delivery of elegiac
composition, greatly diminishes the slides, and reduces
them almost to monotones; nay, a perfect monotone, without any inflection at all, is sometimes very judiciously
introduced in reading verse.
On Scanning.
A certain number of syllables connected form a foot.
They are calledfeet, because it is by their aid that the voice,
as it were, steps along through the verse, in a measured
pace.

nothing gives a more odious appearance of petulance' and

which, vain of the first smatterings' of knowledge, presumes to make light' of what the rest of mankind revere.
At the same' time, you are not to imagine, that, when exhorted to be religious, you are called upon to become more
formal and solemn in your manners than others of the
same' years; or to erect yourselves into supercilious reprovers' of those around you. The spirit of true religion
breathes gentleness' and affability'. It gives a native'
unaffected ease' to the behaviour. It is social', kind', and
cheerful'; far removed from that gloomy' and illiberal'
superstition which clouds the brow', sharpens the temper',
dejects the spirit', and teaches men to fit themselves for
another' world, by neglecting the concerns of this'. Let
your' religion, on the contrary, connect preparation for
heaven' with an honourable discharge of the duties of active
life'. Of such' religion, discover, on every proper' occasion, that you are not ashamed'; but avoid making any

nyself in Westminster Abbey', where the gloominess of
the place', and the use' to which it is applied, with the
solemnity of the buildiring, and the condition of the people'
who lie in it, are apt to fill the mind with a kind of melancholy', or rather thoughtfulness', that is not disagreeable'.
I yesterday passed the whole afternoon in the church'yard, the cloisters', and the church', amusing myself with
the tomb'-stones and inscriptions' that I met with in those
several regions of the dead'. Most of them  recorded
nothing else' of the buried person, but that he was born'
upon one' day, and died' upon another'; the whole history
of his life being comprehended in those two circumstances',
that are common to all' mankind. I could not but look
upon these registers of existence, whether of brass or
marble', as a kind of satire' upon the departed persons, who
ilad left no other' memorial of them, but that they were
born', and that they died'.
Upon my going into the church', I entertained myself
with the. digging of a grave', and saw in every shovel'-full
of it that was thrown up, the fragment of a bone' or skull',
intermixed with a kind of fresh mouldering earth', that
some' time or other had a place in the composition of a
hunman body'. Upon this I began to consider with myself
what innumerable multitudes of people lay confused' together under the pavement of that ancient cathedral'; how
nmen' and women', friends' and enemies', priests' and soldiers', monks' and prebendaries', were crumbled among
one another', and blended together in the same common
mass'; how beauty', strength', and youth', with old age',
weakliless', and deformity', lay undistinguished' in the same
promiscuous heap of matter'.
After having thus surveyed this great magazine of mortality, as it were in the lump', I examined it more particularly', by the accotlmts which I found on several of the
monumnents' which are raised in every quarter of' that
ancient fabric'. Some of them were covered with such
extravagant' epitaphs, that if it were possible for the dead
person to be acquainted' with them, he would blusha at the
praises which his friends hiave bestowed upon him. There
72are others so excessively modest', that they deliver the character of the person departed in Greek' or Hebrew', and
by that' means are not understood once in a twelvemonth'.
In the poetical' quarter I found there were poets' who had
no monuments', and monjuments' which had no poets'. I
observed indeed that the present war had filled the church
with many' of these uninhabited monuments, which had
been erected to the memory of persons' whose bodies were
perhaps buried in the plains of Blenheim', or in the bosom
of the ocean\
I know that entertaiinments of this' nature are apt to
raise dark' and dismal' thoughts in timorous' minds, and
gloomy' imaginations; but, for my own' part, though I am
always serious', I do not know what it is to be melancholy';
and can therefore take a view of Nature in her deep' and
solemn' scenes, with the same pleasnre as in her most gay'
and delightful' ones. By this means I can improve' myself
with those objects which others' consider with terror'.
When I look upon the tombs of the great', every emotion
of envy' dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful', every inordinate desire goes out'; when I meet with
the grief of parents' upon a tombstone, my heart melts
with compassion'; when I see the tomb of the parents
themselves', I consider the vanity of grieving for those'
wlhom we must quickly follow': when I see kings lying by
those who deposed' them; when I consider rival wits
placed side' by side', or the holy men that divided the
world with their contests and disputes', I reflect, witli sorrow' and astonishment', on the little competitions', factions', and debates' of mankind. When I read the several
dates' of the tombs, of some that died yesterday', and some
six hundred years' ago, I consider that great' day when we
shall all of us be contemporaries', and make our appearance
together'.                                 SPECTATOR.
3.-THE FOLLY OF MISPENDING TIME.
AN ancient poet, unreasonably discontented at the present' state of things, which his system of opinions obliged
him to represent in its worst' form, has observed of the
earth', " That its greatest' part is covered by the uninhabit7
73
ADDISON.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
able oceanl; that of the rest' some is encumbered witl
naked mountains', and some lost under barren sands'; some
scorched with unintermitted heat', and some petrified with
perpetual frost'; so that only a few' regions remain for the
production of fruits', the pasture of cattle', and the accommodation of man'."
The same observation may be transferred to the time'
allotted us in our present' state.  When we have deducted
all that is absorbed in sleep', all that is inevitably appropriated to the demands of nature', or irresistibly engrossed by
the tyranny of custom'; all that passes in regulating the
superficial decorations of life', or is given up in the reciprocations of civility to the disposal of others'; all that is
torn from us by the violence of disease', or stolen imperceptibly away by lassitude and languor'; we shall find that'
lart of our duration very small' of which we can truly call
ourselves masters', or which we can spend wholly at our
own choice'.  Many of our hours are lost in a rotation of
petty cares', in a constant recurrence of the same employments'; many of our provisions for ease or happiness' are
always exhausted by the present' day; and a great part of
our existence serves no other' purpose, than that of enabling
us to enjoy the rest'.
Of the few moments which are left' in our disposal, it
may reasonably be expected', that we should be so frugal'
as to let none of them slip from us without some equivalent'; and perhaps it might be found, that as the earth',
however straitened by rocks and waters, is capable of producing more than all its inhabitants are able to consume',
our lives', though much contracted by incidental distraction', would yet afford us a large space vacant to the exercise of reason' and virtue'; that we want not time', but
diligence', for great performances; and that we squander'
niuch of our allowance, even while we think it sparing' and
insuffi cient'.
An Italian philosopher expressed in his motto', that time
was his estate'; an estate', indeed, which will produce
nothing without cultivation', but will always abundantly
repay the labours of industry', and satisfy the most extensive' desires, if no part of it be suffered to lie waste by
negligence', to be overrun with noxious plants', or laid out
for show' rather than for use'.              RAMBLER.
744.-ON THE COMPARATIVE MERIT OF HOMIER AND VIRGIL.
UPON the whole', as to the comparative' merit of these
two great princes of epic poetry, Homer' and Virgil', the
former' must, undoubtedly, be admitted to be the greater
genius'; the latter' to be the more correct' writer. Homer
was an original' in his art, and discovers both the beauties'
and the defects' which are to be expected in an original'
author, compared with those who succeed' him; more
boldness', more nature' and ease', more sublimity' and
force'; but greater irregularities' and negligences' in composition. Virgil' h:as, all along', kept his eye upon Homer'; in
many' places, he has not so much imitated', as he has
literally translated' him. The description of the storm',
for instance, in the first' JEneid, and ZEneas's speech' upon
that occasion, are translations froml the fifth book of the
Odyssey'; not to mention almost all the similes' of Virgil,
which are no other than copies of those of Homer'. The
pre-eminence in invention', therefore, must, beyond doubt,
be ascribed to Homer'. As to the pre-eminence in judgment', though many critics are disposed to give it to Virgil',
yet, in my' opinion, it hangs doubtful'. In Homer', we
discern all the Greeli vivacity'; in Virgil', all the Roman
stateliness'. Homer's' imagination is by much the most rich
and copious'; Virgil's' the most chaste and correct'. The
strength of the former' lies in his power of warming the
fancy'; that of the latter', in his power of touching the
heart'. Homer's' style is more simple and animated'; Virgil's' more elegant and uniform'.  The first' has, on many
occasions, a sublimity' to which the latter never' attains;
but the latter', in return, never sinks below a certain degree
of epic dignity', which cannot so clearly be pronounced of
the former'. Not, however, to detract from the admiration
due to both' these great poets, most of Homer's' defects may
reasonably be imputed, not to his genius', but to the manners of the age' in which he lived; and for the feeble passages of the AEneid', this' excuse ought to be admitted, that
the iF,neid' was left an unfinished' work.  BLAIR.
5.-FAME A COMMENDABLE PASSION.
I CAN by no means agree' with you in thinking, that the
love of fame is a passion, which either reason' or religion'
75
BLAIR.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
condemns.   I confess, indeed, there are some' who have
represented it as inconsistent with bothl'; and I remember,
in particular, the excellent author of The Religion of Nature Delineated', has treated it as highly irrational' and
absurd'.  But surely "'twere to consider too curiously',"
as Horatio says to Hamlet, " to consider thus'."  For
though fame with posterity should be, in the strict' analysis
of it, no other than a mere uninteresting proposition',
amounting to nothing more than that somebody acted meritoriously'; yet it would not necessarily follow', that true
philosophy would banish' the desire of it from the human
breast. For this passion may' be (as nmost certainly' it is)
wisely implanted in our species, notwithstanding the corresponding object should in reality' be very different from
what it appears in imagiiiation'. Do not many of our most
refined' and even contemplative' pleasures owe their existence to our mistakes'?  It is but extending' (I will not
say, improving') some of our senses to a higher degree of
acuteness than we now' possess them, to make the fairest
views of nature', or the noblest productions of art', appear
horrid' and deformed'.  To see things as they truly' and in
themselves' are, would not always, perhaps, be of advantage to us in the intellectual' world, any more than in the
natural'. But, after all, who shall certainly assure us, that
the pleasure of virtuous fame dies' with its possessor, and
reaches not to a farther' scene of existence? There is
nothing, it should seem, either absurd or unphilosophical
in supposing it possible' at least, that the praises of the
good' and the judicious', that sweetest music to an honest
ear in this' world, may be echoed back to the mansions of
the next'; that the poet's description of Fancy' may be
literally true', and though she walks upon earth', she may
yet lift her head into heaven'.
But call it be reasonable to extinguish' a passion which
nature has universally lighted up' in the human breast, and
which we constantly find to burn with most strength and
brightnless in the noblest' and best' formed bosoms? Accordingly revelation is so far from endeavouring (as you
suppose) to eradicate' the seed which nature has deeply
planted, that she rather seems, on the contrary', to cherish
and forward' its growth. To be exalted with honour', and
to be had in everlasting remembrance', are in the number

of those encouragements which the Jewish' dispensation
offered to the virtuous'; as the person from whom the
sacred Author of the Christian system received his birth',
is herself' represented as rejoicing that all generations'
should call her blessed'.
To be convinced' of the great advantage of cherishing
this higli regard to posterity, this noble desire of an afterlife in the breath of others', one need only look back upon
the history of the ancient Greeks' and Romans'. What
other' principle was it, which produced that exalted strain
of virtue in those' days, that may well serve as a model to
these'? Was it not the concurrent approbation of the good',
the uncornupted applause of the wise', (as'Fully calls it,)
that animated their most generous' pursuits?
To confess the truth, I have been ever inclined to think
it a very dangerous' attempt, to endeavour to lessen' the
motives of right conduct, or to raise any suspicion' concerning their solidity. The tempers and dispositions of
mankind are so extremnely different', that it seems necessa-'
ry they should be called into action by a variety' of incitements. Thus, while some' are willing to wed Virtue for
her personal' charms, others' are engaged to take her for
the sake of her expected dowry': and since her followers
and admirers have so little hopes from her at present', it
were pity, rnethinks, to reason them out of any imagined'
advantage in reversion'.   FITZOSBORNE'S LETTERS.

THE secretary' stood alone'. Modern degeneracy' had

features of his character' had the hardihood of antiquity'.
His aiugust mind' overawed majesty itself'.  No state
chicanery', no narrow system of vicious politics', no icd
contest for ministerial victories', sunk him to the vulgar
level of the great'; but overbearing', persuasive', and impracticable', his object' was England', his ambition' was
fame'. Without dividing', he destroyed' party; without
corrupting', he made a venal age unanimous'.  France'

England'. The sight of his mind' was infinite'; and his
schemes were to affect, not England', not the present' age
only, but Europe' and posterity'.  WonderfLul were the
means' by which these schemes were accomplished';- always seasonable', always adequate', the suggestions of an
understanding animated by ardour', and elllightened by
prophecy'.
The ordinary feelings which make life amiable and indolent'.were unknown' to him.   No domestic difficulties',
no domestic- weakness' reached him; but aloof from the
sordid occurrences of life', and unsullied by its intercourse',
he came occasionally' into our system, to counsel' and to
decide'.
A character' so exalted', so strenuous', so various', so
authoritative', astonished' a corrupt age, and the treasury
trembled at the namne of Pitt' through all her classes of
venality'.  Corruption imagined', indeed, that she had
found defects' in this statesman, and tallied much of the
inconsistency of his glory', and much of the ruin of his
victories'; but the history of his country', and the calamities
of the enemy', answered' and refuted' her.
Nor were his political' abilities his only' talents. His
eloquence' was an era' in the senate, peculiar' and spontaneous', familiarly expressing gigantic sentiments' and instinctive wisdom'; not like the torrent of Demosthenes',
or the splendid conflagration of Tully'; it resembled sometimes the thunder', and sometimes the music' of the
spheres.  He did not conduct the understanding through
the painful subtility of argumentation'; nor was he for ever
on the rack of exertion', but rather lightened' upon the
subject, and reached the point' by the flashings of the
mind', which', like those of his eye', were felt', but could
not be followed'.
Upon the whole', there was in this man something that
could create', subvert', or reform'; an understanding', a
spirit', and an eloquence', to summon mankind to society',
or to break the bonds of slavery' asunder, and to rule the
wildness of free' minds with unbounded authority'; sornething that could establish' or overwhelm' empire, and strike
a blow' in the world that should resound through the unlvers6\.                                    ROBERTS ON.
787.-THE TRUTH FREES US FROM TrHE SLAVISH FEAR OF
DEATII.
FROM the bondage of fear', Christ lhas made his followers
free'. By making an atonement' for their sins, he has disarmed Death of his sting'; and by rising as the first-fruits
of them that sleep', he has secured to us the victory over
the grave'. Discovering the reality' of a future worlcd, and
revealing its connexion with the present', he hath elevated
our aims above the region of mortality', and given a new'
aspect and importance to the events which befall us on earth'.
Its joys lose their power to dazzle and seduce', when viewed
through the glory that remains to be revealed'. Its employments cease to be a burden', because we see them leading to an endless recompense of reward'. And even its
sorrows' can no longer overwhelm us, because, when compared with the whole' of our duration, they last but for a
moment', and are the means appointed by our Father' to
prepare us for our future' inheritance.  How cheering' are
these considerations under the severest trials to which we
are exposed'! From how many perplexing', anxious', enslaving' terrors have they set us free'! What' is it, 0 child
of sorrow! what is it that now wrings thy heart', and binds
thee in sadness to the ground'?  Whatever' it be, if thou
knowest the truth', the truth shall give thee relief'. Have
the terrors of guilt' taken hold of thee? Dost thou go all
the day long mourning for thy iniquities', refusing to be
comforted'? Anti on thy bed at night do visions of remorse'
disturb thy rest, and haunt thee with the fears of a judgment'
to come? Behold, the Redeemer' hath borne thy sins in his
own body on the tree'; and, if thou art willing to forsake'
them, thou knowest with certainty that they shall not be
remembered in the judgment' against thee. Hast thou, with
weeping eyes, committed to the grave the child of thy
affections', the virtuous friend of thy youth', or the tender
partner, whose pious attachment lightened the load of life'?
Behold, they are not' dead. Thou knowest that they live
in a better' region with their Saviour' and their God'; that
still thou holdest thy place in their remembrance', and that
thou shalt soon meet' them again to part no more'. Dost
thou look forward with trembling to the days of darkness
that are to fall on thyself', when thou shalt lie on the bed

of sickness', when thy pulse shall have become low'--when
the cold damps' have gathered on thy brow-and the mournful looks of thy attendants have told thee that the hour of
thy departure' has come?  To the mere natural' man this
scene is awful and alarming; but if thou art a Christian'if thou knowest and obeyest' the truth, thou needest fear
no evil'. The shadows which hang over the valley of death'
shall retire at thy approach'; and thou shalt see beyond' it
the spirits of the just', and an innumerable company of angels', the futtire companions of thy bliss', bending from their
thrones to cheer thy departing soul', and to welcome thee
into everlasting' habitations. WVhy then should slavish
terrors of the future' disquiiet thy soul in the days of this'
vain life which passeth away lilie a shadow'? The gospel
hath not given thee the spirit of fear', but of confidence' and
joy'. Even now' there is no condemnation to them who
are in Christ Jesus', who walk not after the flesh', but after
the spirit'; and when they die', (a voice from Heaven' hath
proclaimed it,) "Blessed' are the dead, which die in the
Lord', from henceforth'; yea', saith the Spirit, that they
may rest from their labours', and their works do follow'
them."                                     FINLAYSON.

The cabinets of princes have been long in the habit of
notifying the death of those' who were great, only in their

Antiquity' would have raised altars' to that vast and

9.--THE SPEECH OF A ROMAN OFFICER TO HIS SOLDIERS.
ROME was taken by Totila'.  One of oul brave officers',
whose name was Paul', had sallied out of' the city at the head
of a small party', and intrenched himself on the eminence',
where he was surrounded by the enemy'. Famine', it was
not doubted, would soon reduce him to the necessity of
surrendering'; and, in fact', he was in want of every' thing.
In this exigence', he addressed himself to his soldiers':"My friends'," said he, " we must either perish', or survive in slavery'.  You', I know, will not hesitate' about the
choice: but it is not enough to perish', we Imust perish
nobly'. The coward may resign himself to be consumed by
famine', he may linger in misery', and wait, in a dispirited
condition, for the friendly hand of death'.  But we', who
have been schooled and educated in thte field of battle', we
are not now' to learn the proper use of our arms; we know
how to carve' for ourselves an honourable' death. Yes, let
us die', but not inglorious and unrevenged'; let us die'
covere(d with the blood of our enemies', that our fall',
instead of raising the smile of deliberate nialice', may give
them cause to mourn' over the victory that un(loes us. Can
we wish to loiter a few years more' in life, when we know
that a very few must bring us to our graves'?-The limits
of human life cannot be enlarged by nature', but glory' can
extend thenl, and give a second' life."
81THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
He finished' his harangue: the soldiery declared their
resolution to follow' him. They began their march'; the
intrepid countenance' with which they advanced soon denoted
to the enemy a design to give battle with all the courage of
the last despair'. Without waiting', therefore, to receive'
thlle attack of this illustrious band, the Goths thought proper
to compound', by an immediate grant of life' and liberty'.

Days 6f danger', nights of waking'.
In our isle's enchanted hall',
Hands unseen' thy couch are strewing;
Fairy strains of music' fall,
Every sense in slumber' dewing.

Dream of fighting fields no more';
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking',
Morn of toil', nor night of waking'.
No rude' sound sliall reach thine ear,
Armour's clang', or war'-steed champing,
Trump nor pibroch summon here',
Mustering clan', or squadron' tramping.
Yet the lark's' shrill fife may come
At the daybreak from the fallow',
And the bittern' sound his drum,
Booming from the sedgy shallow'
Ruder' sounds shall none' be near,
Guards nor warders challenge here',
Here's no war-steed's neigh and champing',
Shouting clans' or squadrons stamping'.
Huntsman, rest'! thy chase is done',
While our slumbrous spells assail' ye,
Dream not with the rising sun',
Bugles here shall sound reveille'.

Ere kindling light the Almighty word obey'd',

Shall buirst its prison, and devour' this frame,
From angry heaven when the keen lightning flies,
When fervent heat dissolves the melting skies',
Thou still' shalt be; still as thou wert before',
And know no change', when time shall be no more'
0 endless' thought! divine Eternity'!
The immortal soul' shares but a part' of thee!
For thou wert present when our life began',
When the warm dust' shot up in breathing man'.
Ah! what is life'? with ills' encompass'd round.
Amidst our hopes', fate strikes the sudden wound'.
To-day' the statesman of new' honour dreams,
To-morrow' death destroys' his airy schemes.
Is mouldy treasure' in thy chest confined?
Think all' that treasure tlhou must leave behind';'I'hy heir with smiles shall view thy blazon'd hearse',
And all thy hoards' with lavish hand disperse'.
Should certain fate the impending blow delay',
Thy mirth will sicken', and thy bloom decay';
Then feeble age' will all thy nerves disarm',
No more thy blood' its narrow channels warmn',
Who then would wish to stretch' this narrow span,
To suffer' life beyoncld the date of man?
The virtuous' soul pursues a nobler' aim,
And life' regards but as a fleeting dream';
She longs to wake', and wishes to get free',
To launch from earth' into eternity'.
For while the boundless theme extends' our thought,
Ten thousand' thousand' rolling years are naught'.

Ten' censure' wrong, for one' who writes' amiss.
A fool' might once himself' alone expose;
Now one' in verse' makes many more' in prose'.'Tis with our judgments' as our watches', none
Go just alike', yet each believes his own'.
In poets', as true genius' is but rare,

Both' must alike from Heaven' derive their light;
These' born to judge', as well as those' to write'.
Let such teach others' who themselves' excel,
And censure' freely who have written' well.
Authors' are partial to their wit','tis true;
But are not critics' to their judgment' too?
Yet, if we loolk more closely', we shall find
Most have the seeds' of judgment in their mind:
Nature affords at least a glimmering' light;
The lines, though touched' but faintly, are drawn' right
But as the slightest sketch, if jistly traced,
Is by ill-colouring' but the more disgraced',
So by false learning' is good sense' defaced:
Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools',
And some made coxcombs' nature meant for fools'.
In search of wit' these lose their common sense',
And then turn critics' in' their own defence'.
All fools have still an itching to deride',
And fain would be upon the laughing' side.
If MTvius scribble' in Apollo's spite,
There are who judge' still worse than he can write.
Some have, at first, for wits', then poets', passed,
Turn'd critics' next, and proved plain fools' at last.
Some neither can for wits' nor critics' pass,
As heavy mules' are neither horse' nor ass'.

O what a miracle to man' is man',
Triumphantly distressed'! what joy', what dread'!

An angel's' arm can't snatch' me from the grave;

8P15.-SPEECH OF!ICHARD HENRY LEE IN CONGRESS, 5TH OF
JUNE, 1776, IN FAVOUR OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
I KNOW not, whether among all the civil discords which
have been recorded by historians, and which have been
excited either by the love of liberty in the people, or by
the ambition of princes, there has ever been presented a
deliberation more interesting or more important than that
which now engages our attention; whether we consider
the future destiny of this free and virtuous people, or that
of our enemies themselves, who, notwithstanding theii
tyranny and this cruel war, are still our brethren, and descended from a common stock; or finally, that of the othei
nations of the globe, whose eyes are intent upon this greaI
spectacle, and who anticipate from our success more free
dom for themselves, or from our defeat apprehend heavier
chains and a severer bondage. For the question is, now
whether'we shall acquire an increase of territorial dominioni
or wickedly wrest from others their just possessions; bur
whether we shall preserve, or lose for ever, that liberty
which we have inherited from our ancestors, which we
have pursued across tempestuous seas, and which we have
defended in this land against barbarous men, ferocious
beasts, and an inclement sky. And if so many and distinguishled praises have always been lavished upon the generous defenders of Greek and of Roman liberty, what will be
said of us who defend a liberty which is founded, not uport
the capricious will of an unstable multitude, but upon immutable statutes and tutelary laws; not that which was the
exclusive privilege of a few patricians, but that which is
the property of all; not that which was stained by iniqui.
4ous ostracisins, or the horrible decimation of armies, but
that which is pure, temperate, and gentle, and conformed
to the civilization of the present age. Why then do we
longer procrastinate, and wherefore are these delays? Let
us complete the enterprise already so well commenced;
and since our union with England can no longer consist
with that liberty and peace which are our chief delight,
let us dissolve these fatal ties, and conquer for ever that
good which we already enjoy; an enltire and absolute
independence.
LEE.

But ought I not to begin by observing that if we have
reached that violent extremity, beyond which nothing can
any longer exist between America and England, but either
such war or such peace as are made between foreign
nations, this can only be imputed to the insatiable cupidity,
the tyrannical proceedings, and the outrages, for ten years
reiterated, of the British ministers? What have we not
done to restore peace, to re-establish harmony? Who has
not heard our prayers, and who is ignorant of our supplications? They have wearied the universe. England alone
was deaf to our complaints, and wanted that compassion
towards us which we have found among all other nations.
And as at first our forbearance, and then our resistance,
have proved equally insufficient, since our prayers were
unavailing, as well as the blood lately shed; we must go
further, and proclaim our independence.
Nor let any one believe that we have any other option
left. The time will certainly come when the fated separation must take place, whether you will or no; for so it is
decreed by the very nature of things, the progressive increase of our population, the fertility of our soil, the extent
of our territory, the industry of our countrymen, and the
immensity of the ocean which separates the two states.
And if this be true, as it is niost true, who does not see
that the sooner it takes place the better; and that it would
be not only imprudent, but the height of folly, not to seize
the present occasion, when British injustice has filled all
hearts with indignation, inspired all minds with courage,
united all opinions in one, and put arms in every hand?
And how long must we traverse three thousand miles of a
stormy sea, to go and solicit of arrogant and insolent men,
either counsels or commands to regulate our domestic
affairs? Does it not become a great, rich, and powerful
nation, as we are, to look at home, and not abroad, for the
government of its own concerns? And how can a ministry
of strangers judge, with any discernment, of our interests,
when they know not, and when it little imports them to
know, what is good for us, and what is not? The past justice of the British ministers should warn us against the
"uture, if they should ever seize us again in their cruel claws.
Since it has pleased our barbarous enemies to place before
us the alternative of slavery or of independence, where isthe generous-minded man and the lover of his country,
who can hesitate to choose? With these perfidious men
no promise is secure, no pledges sacred.
Let us suppose, which Heaven avert, that we are conquered; let us suppose an accommodation. What assurance have we of the British moderation in victory, or good
faith in treaty?  Is it their having enlisted and let loose
against us the ferocious Indians, and the merciless soldiers
of Germany? Is it that faith, so often pledged and so
often violated in the course of the present contest; this
British faith, which is reported more false than Punic?
We ought rather to expect, that when we shall have fallen
naked and unarmed into their hands, they will wreak upon
us their fury and their vengeance; they will load us with
heavier chains, in order to deprive us not only of the power,
but even of the hope of again recovering our liberty. But
I am willing to admit, although it is a thing without example, that the British government will forget past offences
and perform its promises, can we imagine, that after so
long dissensions, after so many outrages, so many combats,
and so much bloodshed, our reconciliation could be durable,
and that every day, in the midst of so much hatred and
rancour, would not afford some fresh subject of animosity?
The two nations are already separated in interest and affections; the one is conscious of its ancient strength, the other
has become acquainted with its newly-exerted force; the
one desires to rule in an arbitrary manner, the other will
not obey even if allowed its privileges. In such a state of
things, what peace, what concord can be expected?
The Americans may become faithful friends to the English, but subjects, never. And even though union could be
restored without rancour, it could not without danger.
The wealth and power of Great Britain should inspire prudent men with fears for the future. Having reached such
a height of grandeur that she has no longer any thing to
dread from foreign powers, in the security of peace the
spirit of her people will decay, manners will be corrupted,
her youth will grow up in the midst of vice, and in this
state of degeneration, England will become the prey of a
foreign enemy, or an ambitious citizen. If we remain
united with her, we shall partake of her corruptions and
misfortunes, the more to be dreaded as they will be irrepa8$*

LEE.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
rable; separated from her, on the contrary, as we are, we
should neither have to fear the seductions of peace nor the
dangers of war. By a declaration of our freedom, the
perils would not be increased; but we should add to the
ardour of our defenders, and to the splendour of victory.
Let us then take a firm step, and escape frolm this labyrinth; we have assumed the sovereign power, and dare not
confess it; we disobey a king, and acknowledge ourselves
his subjects; wage war against a people, on whom we incessantly protest our desire to depend.  What is the consequence of so many inconsistencies? Hesitation paralyses
all our measures; the way we ought to pursue, is not
marked out; our generals are neither respected nor obeyed;
ouir soldiers have neither confidence nor zeal; feeble at
home, and little considered abroad, foreign princes can
neither esteem nor succour so timid and waveriing a people.
But independence once proclaimed and our object avowed,
more manly and decided measures will be adopted; all
minds will be fired by the greatness of the enterprise, the
civil magistrates will be inspired with new zeal, the generals with fresh ardour, and the citizens with greater constancy, to attain so high and so glorious a destiny.
There are some who seem to dread the effects of this
resolution. But will England, or can she, manifest against
us greater vigour and rage than she has already displayed?
She deems resistance against oppression no less rebellion
than independence itself. And where are those formidable
troops that are to subdue the Americans? What the English
could not do, can it be done by Germans? Are they
more brave, or better disciplined? The number of our
enemies is increased; but our own is not diminished,
and the battles we have sustained have given us the practice of arms and the experience of war. Who doubts,
then, that a declaration of independence will procure us
allies? All nations are desirous of procuring, by commerce, the productions of our exuberant soil; they will visit
our ports, hitherto closed by the monopoly of insatiable
England. They are no less eager to contemplate the reduction of her hated power; they all loathe her barbarous
dominion; their succours will evince to our brave countrymen the gratitude'they bear them for having been the first
to shake the foundations of this Colossus. Foreign princes
90wait only for the extinction of all hazard of reconciliation
to throw off their present reserve.
If this measure is usef'ul, it is no less becoming our dignity. America has arrived at a degree of power which
assigns her a place among independent nations; we are not
less entitled to it than the English themselves. If they
have wealth, so also have we; if they are brave, so are
we; if they are more numerous, our population, through
the incredible fruitfulness of our chaste wives, will sooni
equal theirs; if they have men of renown as well in
peace as in war, we likewise have such; political revolutions usually produce great, brave, and generous spirits.
From what we have already achieved in these painful
beginnings, it is easy to presume what we shall hereafter accomplish; for experience is the source of sage
counsels, and liberty is the mother of great men. Have
you not seen the enemy driven from Lexington by thirty
thousand citizens armed and assembled in one day? Already their most celebrated generals have yielded in Boston
to the skill of ours: already their seamen, repulsed from
our coasts, wander over the ocean, where they are the sport
of tempest, and the prey of famine. Let us hail the favourable omen, and fight not for the sake of knowing on what
terms we are to be the slaves of England, but to secure to
ourselves a free existence, to found a just and independent
government. Animated by liberty, the Greeks repulsed the
innumerable army of Persians; sustained by the love of
independence, the Swiss and the Dutch humbled the power
of Austria by memorable defeats, and conquered a rank
among nations. But the sun of America also shines upon
the heads of the brave; the point of our weapons is no less
formidable than theirs; here also the same union prevails,
the same contempt of dangers and of death in asserting tlle
cause of country.
Why then do we longer delay, why still deliberate?
Let this most happy day give birth to the American republic.  let her arise, not to devastate and conquer, but to reestablish the reign of peace and of the laws. The eyes of
Europe are fixed upon us; she demands of us a living example of freedom, that may contrast, by the felicity of the
citizens, with the ever increasing tyranny which desolates
her polluted shores. She invites us to prepare an asylum
91
LEE.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER,
where the unhappy may find solace, and the persecuted
repose. She entreats us to cultivate a propitious soil,
where that generous plant which first sprung up and grew
in England, but is now withered by the poisonous blasts
of Scottish tyranny, may revive and flourish, sheltering
under its salubrious and interminable shade all the unfortiunate of tile human race. This is the end presaged by so
many omens, by our first victories, by the present ardour
and union, by the flight of Howe, and the pestilence wlich
broke out:among Dunmore's people, by the very winds
which baffled the enemy's fleets and transports, and that
terrible tempest which ingulfed seven hundred vessels upon
the coasts of Newfoundland. If we are not this day wanting in our duty to country, the names of the American
legislators will be placed, by posterity, at the side of those
of Theseus, of Lycurgus, of Romulus, of Numa, of the
three Williams of Nassau, and of all those whose memory
has been, and will be, for ever dear to virtuous men and
good citizens.                                   LEE.
16.-SPEECH  OF PATRICK HENRY BEFORE THE VIRGINIA
CONVENTION OF DELEGATES, MARCH, 1775.
MR. PRESIDENT,-It is natural for man to indulge in the
illlusions of hope.  We are apt to shut our eyes against a
painful truth-and listen to the song of that syren, till slie
transforms us into beasts. Is it the part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we
disposed to be of the number of those, who, having eyes,
see not, and having ears, hear not, the things, which so
nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part,
whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to
know the whole truth, and to provide for it.
I have but one lamp, by which my feet are guided; and
that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of
judging of the future, but by the past. Alfd judging by
the past, I wish to know, what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry, for the last ten years, to justify those hopes, with which gentlemen have been pleased
to solace thernselves and the house.
I,s it that insidious smile with which our petition has
92been lately received?  Trust it not, sir; it will prove a
snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed
with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception
of our petition comports with those warlike preparations,
which cover our waters and darken our land?
Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and
reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to
be reconciled, that force must be called in, to will back our
love?  Let us not deceive ourselves, sir.'I'hese are the
inmplements of war and subjugation--the last argiiments to
which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this
martial array if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other motive for it?
Has Great Britain any other enemy in this quarter of
the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and
armies? No, sir: she has none.  They are meant for us:
they can he meant for no other. They are sent over to
bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British
ministers have been so long forging.
And what have we to oppose to themi?  Shall we try
argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten
years. Have we any tbhing new to offer on the subject?
Nothing.  We have held the subject up in every light of
which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we
resort to entreaty and humble supplication? Whiat terms
shall we find, which have not been already exhausted 3
Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer.
Sir, we have done every thing that could be done, to
avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned-we have remonstrated-we have supplicated-we
have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the
ministry and parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence
and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and
we have been spurned with contempt from the foot of the
throne.
In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope
of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room
for hope. If we wish to be free-if we mean to preserve
inviolate those inestimable privileges, for which we have
been so long contending-if we mean not basely to aban93
HENRY.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
don the noble struggle, in which we have been so long
engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to
abandon, until the glorious object of our contest shall be
obtained-we must fight!-- repeat it, sir, we must fight!
An appeal to arms, and to the God of Hosts, is all that is
left us!
They tell us, sir, that we are weak--unable to cope
with so formidable an ad(versary. But when shall we be
stronger?  Will it be the next week or the next year?
Will it be when we are totally disarmed; and when a
Britisli guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we
gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we
acquire tile means of effectual resistance, by lying supinely
on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope,
until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?
Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those
means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.
Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty,
and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.
Besides, sir, we shall not fight alone. There is a just God,
who presides over the destinies of nations; and who will
raise up friends to fight our battles for us.
The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the
vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no
election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too
late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat, but in
submission and slavery!- Our chains are forged. Their
clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The
war is inevitable-and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it
come!
It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen
may cry, peace, peace-but there is no peace. The war
is actually begun? The next gale that sweeps from the
north, will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!
Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here
idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they
have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased
at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Heaven!I know not what course others may take; but as for megive me liberty, or give me death.        HENRY.
9417.-SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS IN FAVOUR OF THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
SINK or swim, live or die, survive or perisli, I give my
hand and my heart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that in
the beginning we aimed not at independence. But there's
a divinity which shapes our ends. The injustice of England has driven us to arms; and, blinded to her own interest for our good, she has obstinately persisted, till independence is now within our grasp. We have but to reach
forth to it, and it is ours.
Why then should we defer the declaration? Is any man
so weak as now to hope for a reconciliation with England,
which shall leave either safety to the country and its liberties, or safety to his own life and his own honour?  Are
not you, sir, who sit in that chair, is not he, our venerable
colleague near you, are you not both already the proscribed
and predestined objects of punishment and of vengeance?
Cut off from all hope of royal clemency, what are you,
what can you be, while the power of England remains, but
outlaws?
If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry on,
or to give up the war? Do we mean to submit to the measures of parliament, Boston port bill and all? Do we mean
to submit, and consent that we ourselves shall be ground to
powder, and our country and its rights trodden down in the
dust?  I know we do not mean to submit. We never
shall submit.
Do we intend to violate that most solemn obligation ever
entered into by men, that plighting, before God, of our
sacred honour to Washington, when putting him forth to
incur the dangers of war, as well as the political hazards
of the times, we promised to adhere to him, in every extremity, with our fortunes and our lives?  I know there
is not a man here, who would not rather see a general
conflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake sink it,
than one jot or tittle of that plighted faith fall to the-'
ground.
For myself, having, twelve months ago, in this place,
moved you that George Washington be appointed commander of the forces, raised or to be raised, for defence of
American liberty, may my right hand forget her cunning,
95
ADAMS.THE AMERICAN SPEAKER.
and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate
or waver in the support I give him. The war, then, must
go on. We, must fight it through. And if the war must
go on, why put off longer the declaration of independence?
T'ihat measure will strengthen us. It will give us character
abroad.
l?he nations will then treat with us, which they never
can do while we acknowledge ourselves subjects, in arms
against our sovereign.  Nay, I maintain that England, herself, will sooner treat for peace with us on the footing of
independence, than consent, by repealing her acts, to acknowledge that her whole conduct toward us has been a
course of injustice and oppression. Her pride will be less
wounded by submitting to that course of things which now
predestinates our independence, than by yielding the points
in controversy to her rebellious subjects.  The former she
would regard as the result of fortune; the latter she would
feel as her own deep disgrace. Why then, why then, sir,
do we not as soon as possible. change this from a civil to a
national war?  And since we must fight it through, why
not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all the benefits of
victory, if we gain the victory?'
If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not
fail. The cause will raise up armies; the cause will create
navies. The people, the people, if we are true to them,
will carry us, and will carry themselves, gloriously, through
this struggle. I care not how fickle other people have
been found. I know the people of these colonies, and I
know that resistance to British aggression is deep and settled
in their hearts and cannot be eradicated. Every colony,
indeed, has expressed its willingness to follow, if we but
take the lead. Sir, the declaration will inspire the people
with increased courage. Instead of a long and bloody war
for restoration of privileges, for redress of grievances, for
chartered immunities, held under a British king, set before
them the glorious object of entire independence, and it
will breathe into them anew the breath of life.
Read this declaration at the head of the armny; every
sword will be drawn from its scabbard, and the solemn
vow uttered to maintain it, or to perish on the bed of honour.
Publish it from the pulpit; religion will approve it, and the
love of religious liberty will cling round it, resolved to
96stand with it, or fall with it. Send it to the public halls;
proclaim it there; let them hear it, who heard the first roar
of the enemy's cannon; let them see it, who saw their
brothers and their sons fall on the field of Bunker hill, and
in the streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very
walls will cry out in its support.
Sir, I know the juncertainty of human affairs, but I see,
I see clearly through this day's business. You and 1, indeed, may rue it.  We may not live to the time wlien this
declaration shall be made good. We may die; die, colonists; die, slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on
the scaffold. Be it so. Be it so. If it be the pleasure of
Heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of
my life, the victim shall be ready, at the appointed hour
of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But while I do
live, let me have a country, or at least the hope of a country, and that a free country.
But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured,
that this declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and
it may cost blood; but it will stand, and it will richly
compensate for both.  Through the thick gloom of the
p)resent, I see the brightness of the future, as the sun in
heaven.  We shall make this a glorious, an immortal
day. When we are in our graves, our children will honour
it. They will celebrate it, with thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations.  On its annual return
Ihey will shed tears, copious, gushing tears, not of subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of gratitude, and of jov.
Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves this measure, and my whole heart is in it.
All that I have,- and all that I am, and all that I hope, in
this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it; and I leave
off as I begun, that live or die, survive or perish, I am for
the declaration. It is my living sentiment, and by the
blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment; independence now; and INDEPENDENCE FOR EVER.     WEBSTER.
