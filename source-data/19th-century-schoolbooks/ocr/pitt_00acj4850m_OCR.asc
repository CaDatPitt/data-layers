Shall we not devote time and toil to learn how to
be happy? It is a science which the youngest child
may begin, and the wisest man is never weary of
If we attain the knowledge of many languages, and
the fame of great learning, yet fail in that which
makes the heart happy and the life good,-our
knowledge is but "'sounding brass, and a tinkling
cymbal."
The objects to be kept in view by all who seek a
good education, are to discharge every duty,-to
make others happy, and to love good things. May
they not be compared to three steps leading to a
beautiful house where you wish to go? Eachl one
that you ascend, brings you nearer to the threshold.
The temple of happiness in this world, is the
temple of goodness. And the temple of happiness
in the world to come, is heaven. There, all the good
of every nation meet and dwell together forever.
These temples communicate with each other, and a
xight education is the way of entrance to both.
The different parts of a good education may be
called the alphabet of happiness. And from this
alphabet is formed a language for angels. That is
but a lame education, which stops short of a higher
world.
I seem to hear some little voice asking, "when
will a good education be finished?--Will it be finished when we have done going to school, or are grown
up women?"  I tell you it will never be finished,
until you die. He alone, who bids the pulse stop,
and the cold heart lie still in the bosom, is able to
say " it is finished."THE GIRLrS READING-BOOK.
Since salt is so necessary to man, the Creator has
distributed it with a liberal hand. It mingles witht
seas and oceans-it rises in the formn of rocks-it is
found in mines-it covers, for miles, the surface of
some regions-it breaks forth in briny fountains
from the bosom of the earth.
Rock salt is sometimes of a pure white, and
sometimes variously coloured.  In Africa, are
many mountains of entire salt. In the kingdom
of Tunis, is one composed of red and violet colour.
Great masses of solid salt, cover the summit of
mountains wThich bound the desert on the west of
Cairo.
There is a village in Spain, situated at the base of
a rock of salt, five hundred feet in heighth, and a
league in circumference.  Most of this is white,
though some is of a fine blue. At Halle, in the
Tyrol, are ranges of salt-rocks, worked by means of
galleries cut into them.
Historians have said that dwellings were anciently
built of rock-salt in Lybia. They are still found in
Arabia, and other parts of the globe. In the vast
salt-mines of Poland, houses and chapels exist, and
when illuminated by torches have a magnificent ap.pearance. You remember the palace of ice built
by an Empress of Russia, which was so brilliant
when the lamps were lighted in the evening.
The salt-mines, near Cracow'in Poland, have been
wrought for six hundred years, and still produce
six thousand tons annually. The excavations extend for miles, and near two thousand labourers are
employed there. Different parts of the Carpathian
100THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
mountains, and of Siberia, are also rich in veins of
salt.
The mines of Salzburg, in Austria, are more than
a thousand feet in depth. Their subterranean expanse:is dazzling with crystals of the most brilliant
hues, and, now and then, the waters of a lake, where
boats conveying visitants glide, sparkle in the torchlight, as if overhung by a fret-work of diamonds.
Salt is scattered in masses, over America and
Asia, as well as over Africa and Europe. Innumerable fountains of brine spring up throughout
the globe, whence salt is manufactured for the inhabitants, and for commerce. Many parts of the
United States are rich in these. You have doubtless heard of the very productive ones at Salina, in
the State of New-York.
Salt is a source of revenue in various regions.
The Emperor of Austria is said to derive ~100,000
annually from his mines of salt. There are various
ways of preparing it, from sea-water, from salt-lakes,
and springs. It is sometimes boiled, and sometimes
made in the open air, by solar evaporation.
Bay-salt is what is made by the heat of the sun.
It is of two kinds; the first drawn from sea-water,
the second from springs or lakes. Marine-salt is
extracted from the water of the sea by boiling.
Fishery-salt is made by slow evaporation, and is
known by its large and coarse crystals.
The white salt of Normandy, has been quite a
source of gain to France. It is prepared by suffering
the rising tide to flow into reservoirs, whe.re, after
partial evaporation, it filters through straw into ves9*
101102          THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
sels placed for it. It is then boiled, with continuai
stirring, and purified by draining through large
osier baskets.
But, my dear young friends, I think I hear you
say, " Was not the title of this essay Suynday-salt?
We have been told of rock-salt, and bay-salt, and
mlarine-salt, and fishery-salt, and the white-salt of
Normandy, but not a word about what we expected
to hear described.  Now what can Sunday-salt
mean?" I am just going to tell you.
I was once attending the lectures of a professor,
who, among other means of acquiring information,
had travelled in Europe. He said, that when he
was in Scotland, he observed what might often be
seen in his own country, that the salt obtained by
the action of fire, instead of the heat of the sun, was
sometimes injured by haste in the process.
By a too rapid evaporation, many foreign and
earthy substances are apt to be left behind. In
Scotland, the manufacturers of salt continue their
labours until twelve on Saturday night. They then
kindle a large fire under it, and retire to their
homes.
The crystallization going on more slowly than
usual during the sabbath, those impurities which
cause bitterness, are separated and exhaled. The
material thus elaborated, is of superior excellence.
It commands a higher price in the market, and is
sold by the name of Sunday-salt.
After I had heard the learned professor's description of Sunday-salt, it occurred to me that we might
make it ourselves, thouglh in a different way. TheTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK,
cares and pursuits of the week sometimes, like
fierce fires, overheat the soul, and render it turbid.
Might we not so avoid them, one day in seven, and
so cultivate different trains of thought, as to have
Sunday-salt of our own?
If we take the time which God reserves to himself for our own employments-if, like the unbelieving Israelites, we go forth to gather our daily food
on the sabbath,-what we consider gain will prove a
mixture of trouble. It will be like what our,blessed
Saviour calls, "salt that has lost its savour; wherewith shall it be salted?"'
The Almighty hath said, " remember the sabbathday to keep it holy." We cannot disobey him and
be happy. We cannot sweep manna from the earth
on this consecrated season, and prosper. But we
may make Sunday-salt,in the laboratory of a meek
and prayerful spirit.
May we not carry with us throughout the week,
this Sunday-salt, to purify our lives and conversation? It may sometimes be in danger of dissolving
in the humid atmosphere of the planet that we inhabit. But may we not preserve it in the casket of
a watchful soul? Let us try.
Can we sell our Sunday-salt? Yes; at the gate
of heaven.  The saints who- have entered there,
"through much tribulation," will tell you that it
was the purifying principle in the rough sea of life.
Angels know its value-it will bring the gold of
eternity.

WHAT flights does the imagination take during the
hours of sleep! WThile the body slumbers, she
climbs the cliff, or hangs over the abyss, or poises
her pinion on the storm-cloud, or robes herself with
the rainbow, and listens at the gate of heaven.
Sometimes she takes memory with her, dragging
her along, like a half-wakened companion.
Tlhen distant friends are brought near. The lost
return from the dead. The scenes of early days are
retouched, anid buried feelings kindle anew in the
heart. Still, memory performs her office imperfectly, and reluctant to be Withdrawn from sleep,
relapses into'it again. Then, unbridled fancy revels
alone, and so bold and bright are her visions, that
the waking eye would fain prolong them, and
wishes to turn from the tame reality of life.
Some hold it trifling and visionary, to speak of
dreams. But, because they have been abused by
superstition and ignorance, are they never to be approached with clear and rational thotght? They
occupy a formidable portion of our little span o?
life. They are sources of pleasure, or of pain.
Dreams sometimes cast their shadows over our
waking hours. Our feelings through the day may
partake of their colouring. We rise from frightful
visions exhausted as by positive labour or suffering.
If there is any regimen which will modify their
character, and give them the aspect of happiness, it
would be desirable to know it.
104THE GIRLOS READING-BOOK.
Is it of no consequence whether we are to spend
a third part of our lives in the midst of fancied terrors, or of delightful imagery? Whether we are to
be borne on airy wings over varied regions, rejoicing
in their beauty, and holding converse with the
lovely and beloved'? or, whether we are to shiver
among nameless dangers, harassed by frightful speetres, and startled by fiery clouds above, and an impassable gulf below'?
Do not consider dreams altogether as idle vagaries of th,e brain. Respect them, and they will be
your friends. But I hear you ask, is there really
any way of procurinlg pleasant dreams?  I have
heard those %who were wiser than myself. say there
was; and I should like to give you some ancient
rules, which have been recommended as means of
insuring them.
1st. Preserve equanimity of temper. Indilge,
during the day, in no angry, envious, or vengeful
feeling. Do not disturb or quicken the current of
blood through the heart, by any violent emotion. A
regular pulse, and a calm, even circulation of blood
and spirits, are favourable both to pleasant dreams
and to longevity.
2d. Avoid compression in dress. Let the lungs
and heart, the stomach and spine, be unfettered to
perform the fui'ctions appointed by their Creator.
To tie up labourers, and then exact their services,
resembles the unjust and cruel policy of ancient
Egypt, in demanding brick without straw.
3d. Be temperate in all things. Permit nothing
to pass into your stomach which is calculated to
105TRE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
disorder it. Avoid high-seasoned meats, rich sauces,
unripe fruits, and stimulating drinks. Even of
plain and proper food do not take- an undue quantity, but desist before the appetite is fully satiated.
Some judicious physicians direct that nothing
should be eaten between meals, or after the regular
supper. Remember that the stomach is the keystone of the frame, and do not abuse it, for this cannot be long done with impunity.
4th. Have your sleeping-room pure and wellventilated. Air it every morning after rising, and
strip the clothes from your bed for some time before
it is made. Perform, when possible, a general ablution, before retiring, that the pores of the skin
may be unchecked in their important office during
sleep. If you can do nothing more, wash your
face, hands, and neck, and comb your hair. Let
your position be unconstrained, when you resign
yourself to sleep, and your face entirely uncovered, and a free circulation of air secured in the
apartment.
5th. Be kind, affectionate, and benevolent, to those
with whom you associate. Do all the good in your
power. Preserve cheerfulness of spirits, voice. and
manner. Keep a "conscience void of offeience towards God and towards man." The happiness of
dreams will repay your efforts.
6th. If aught evil has been harboured in your bosom, throughout the day, cast it forth ere you
sleep, by penitence and prayer. Lay your head on
your pillow, at peace with all the world. Close
your eyes with a smile on your countenance, and
106THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
resign yourself to the spirit of sweet dreams, and
to the ministry of angels.
Do not lightly condemn these rules, my dear
young friends, though they may seem antiquated.
Test them for one year, before you decide against
them. Then, if you should find that they fail in
producing such dreams as you desire, you will be
convinced that they help to confer the more durable
treasure of a good life.
One more thought about dreams. Do they not
help to prove the soul's immortality? Its clay companion is weary, and lies down to rest. But with a
tireless strength it wakes, it wanders, it expatiates,
it soars. Thus sleep, which has been called the
i brother of death," brings us proof that we are to
live for ever.
Glorious truth! breathed to us in dreams, as well
as written:-tpon the pages of inspiration. We are
to live for ever. Though we seem to be swallowed
up in the grave, we shall rise again. May we so
keep God's commandments, that our eternal abode
shall be in those mansions where there is no more
sleep, because there can be no weariness or wo,
and where the brightest dream of earth's prompting
fades in darkness before the full and fearless certainty of bliss.

PERSEVERANCE.
Two little girls, whose names were Emma and
Ann, lived near each other, and attended the same
school. They were frequently together, and their
parents encouraged the intimacy. In winter, they
might often be seen leading each other through the
snow, and in summer cultivating the little spot of
ground that was allowed them. As the gardens of
their fathers were divided only by a slight fence,
they could easily converse, or exchange the flowers
that they reared.
Their parents wished to give them a good education, and sent them to the best schools that the place
afforded. Both'were anxious to excel in their studies, but Emma acquired knowledge with far greater ease than her companion. She qui:ekly comprehended a new subject, and readily committed long
lessons to memory. Confidence in her own powers,
gave her promptness of manner, and she was invariably distinguished at all public examinations.
Ann learned slowly, and was diffident. She was
sometimes silent. through fear of being wrong, and
made her friends ashamed of her appearance of ignorance. She would plod for hours over her appointed. tasks. and often return home her eyes swollen with weeping, at having missed in the recitations.
Her- mother once said to her. " I am distressed at
seeing you so unhappy. You have not the capacity
of Emma, and must be willing to see her take a
higher rank than yourself.THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
C" But I will give you a recipe, which, if it cannot
procure for you brilliant talents, will aid you to
make the best use of such as are entrusted to you.
When you attempt ally thing difficult, say,' I will
persevere,' and ask assistance of your Father in
heaven. Thank him for the gifts of reason and understanding, and entreat him for a heart to love your
friend as sincerely when she excels you, as at any
other time: for you cannot expect to make progress
in a good cause, if your spirits are agitated, or envious at another's success."
The little girl kissed her mother, and promised to
obey her directions. That night, after she was in
bed, she reflected so much upon them, that although
she had as ulsual said her prayers, she arose, and
again kneeling, implored strength to persevere.
Now, when her tasks were difficult, she no longer
wept, but by patient study and laborious repetition,
endeavoured to conquer them. It was not long, before her improvement was obvious, both to her in
structor and associates.
Strict mental discipline gave her an interesting
deportment, while the consciousness that she possessed no genius of which to boast, guarded her
humility. At length, a difficult Latin lesson was assigned to her class. It contained many words to be
sought out in the dictionary, and much idiom and
transposition. The recitation was to be immediately
on entering the school in the morning, and those who
sustained it without mistake, were to be rewarded
by commencing the study of Virgil. The others
were to review an elementary book.

109THE GIRL S READING-BOOK.         11
This whole life is but one great school. From the
cradle to the grave, we are all scholars. The voices
of those we love, and the wisdom of past ages, and
our own experience, are our teachers. Afflictions
give us discipline. The spirits of departed saints
whisper to us,-" Come up hither."
God's holy Word is our code of laws. He commands us there to " give him our heart,-to remember him in the days of our youth."' May we go to
his heaven, as to our father's home, when school is
done, and the little hour-glass of our days and nights
shall be turned no more.110         THE GIRLIS READING-BOOK.
Ann's heart died within her, as she heard Emma
exclaim, "Pray, appoint us a longer lesson. This
will be no trial at all. It will not occupy me half an
hour." But Emma had begun to feel the pride of
talents. She had been praised by her friends, more
than was prudent. She had begun to remit her efforts, and to fancy that her reputation as a scholar
was established.
The evening in which the lesson was to be learned, her mother had company. She found it pleasant
to sit with them, as they applauded her remarks,
and said she had a great deal of wit. Her mother
thought she detected some pertness in her conversation, and advised her to go to her book. But she
excused herself till the morning. When morning
came, having retired later than usual, she did not
feel like rising early, and then in a great hurry, and
half dressed, hastened to her lesson.
Now, though Emma was blessed with a very quick
perception, she had but little! patience. When any
thing really difficult occurred in her lessons, she
was very apt to throw them by, or to prevail on her
father to assist her. But he was now absent. With
dismay, she now heard the clock strike for school,
while she was yet unprepared. Hasting along, with
her hat and shawl half on, dropping first one glove,
then the other, and studying all the way down the
street, she frequently stumbled, and once fell entirely
down.
She took her seat in the class, with a beating
heart, but determined to put the best face on the
matter. One or two hesitations, she managed toTIIE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
pass off with her usual address, but just as her spirits
were beginning to rise with the hope of victory, she
made several absolute and prominent mistakes. The
truth was, that notwithstanding her fine talents, she
was not a thorough scholar. She valued herself
upon her rapid translations, but in grammatical accuracy, was inferior to many whose want of genius
she ridiculed.
Covering her face with her hands, she burst into
tears. All hope of being raised to a higher class,
was for that time swept away. But what irritated
her feelings, even more than her own defeat, was to
hear Ann giving her answers with entire correctness
and precision, and finally to see her included in the
honorary band. Complaining of a headache, she
hastened home, and when Ann, in her kindness and
simplicity of heart, called to ask after her health,
she could scarcely bring her mind to speak to her,
so bitter was her disappointment.
Now, when Ann, the preceding evening, had gone
from school with her dreaded lesson, she at first felt
disposed to weep. But recollecting her promise to
her mother, she said, " Iwill persevere." She scarcely staid for supper, so much did she fear that the allotted time would be insufficient for her slow mind.
Her mother, perceiving how intensely she laboured,
said, " I should wish to assist you, dear Ann, were I
acquainted with the language in which you study.
Yet this would only be doing you an injury. Strength
of mind comes from vanquishing obstacles, and
knowledge painfully gained, is not easily lost."
The little girl, looking meekly up, answered, " I
111112         THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
think God will help me to persevere." She wished
to sit up very late, but her mother forbade it, on account of her eyes. So, she laid her books under her
pillow, and with the day-light resumed her studies.
Many difficulties occurred in the lesson, but she reflected as she went to school, that she had done all
in her power to overcome them, and that this would
comfort her, if she lost the desired honour.
When she found herself among the fortunate
band, she felt surprised, as well as delighted, and
thanked in her heart Him who had helped her to
persevere. But Emma's pride was so much hurt,
that it affected her friendship, and sometimes when
she saw Ann coming to meet her, would turn away,
and whisper to some of her companions, that'" the
dull expression of that girl's face, made her shockingly nervous."
The appointed time now approached for a recitation of poetry and dialogue, to which their teacher
had given them permission to invite their parents
and a few friends. Here Emma consoled herself
with the hope of a complete triumph over Ann.
Pursuits that required little labour, she was very
willing to undertake. For this exhibition, she anxiously prepared, and her fine elocution and confident manners, attracted admiring attention, while
her diffident friend was wholly undistinguished.
Ann joined with so much good-humour and sincerity in the praises of her friend, that Emma forgot her coldness, and harmony was again restored.
During the whole of her continuance at school, she
continued to excel in those accomplishments whichTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
tend to display, and to avoid the studies which required application. The advances which she made,
though sometimles great, were irregular, and the
promise which she had prematurely given, was but
imperfectly fulfilled..
Ann, who early acquired the name of a dull
scholar, carefully treasured her laborious gains, and
through perseverance, surpassed all expectation. A
prelnium was offered for the greatest proficiency in
arithmetic and geometry. "I am sure of it," thought
Emma, "' for I have been so long in algebra, that
such simple studies are but A B C to me." So, by
a few occasional efforts, she would distance all-competitors, and then suffer her mind to be amused with
trifles, or to relapse into indolence.
But the prize was to be obtained by the strictlycomputed improvement of several months, and not
by a few desultory performances. So, she was appointed to see it won by the indefatigable Ann, with
the high approbation of her instructor. She consoled herself under the disappointment, by saying,
that "the premium was no criterion of talent, but
merely givein to encourage the plodders of the school,
among whom she had not the least ambition to appear."
Ann, by following the judicious directions of her
mother, at length attained a highly respectable rank
in all her studies. When she left school, she carried with her the same perseverance which had been
there so serviceable. She had been taught that educationl was valuable, not merely for the knowledge it
imparts, but for the habits of mind it creates, and
S0*

the principles of action it confirms, and she endeavoured to prove in domestic life, that hers had not
been in vain.
It was her pleasure to sit with her work-basket
or book, by the side of her widowed mother, cheering her solitary hours. But Emma soon became so
absorbed in gay and fashionable amuseinelts, that
useful employment was irksome. She said, "she
thanked her stars, she was blessed with sufficient
sense not to be a mope, while she was young."
When she married, it was her ambition to make
a showy appearance. Rational economy, she had
neither patience to study, nor,self-control to practise. It involved such petty details, that it seemed
to her beneath the notice of a liberal and refined intellect. The regulation of her children's temper
and character was sadly neglected, from that disposition to avoid trouble which she had long indulged.
When faults were disclosed that required immediate attention, she was too prone to put them aside,
as she did her difficult lessons at school. She complained of them as too troublesome for lher to contend with, or comforted herself with the indolent
hope, that " all would come right at last." But it
was not long ere she was constrained to say, that
"if she was to bring up another family, her first
course would be to teach them that order, industry,
and perseverance, which she had herself lever
learned."
In a few years after their marriage, the affairs of
her husband became seriously embarrassed. Then
she was greatly astonished and distressed. She was
114THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
too helpless to do ally thinlg for his relief. With
the science that prevents the wasteful expenditure
of servants, provides for the comfort, but not profusion of a table, or prolongs the existence of a
wardrobe, she was wholly unacquainted.
Of these habits of persevering industry, which
she had ridiculed in her friend Ann, she now felt the
need. How often did she lament her early neglect
of that application and self-control, which in womnan's sphere of duty, are more valuable than those
talents which dazzle, and demand admiration as
their daily food.
But Ann found the discipline to which she had
been subjected in. childhood, an excellent preparation for domestic duty. When she encountered difficulties, she was not dismayed. She knew in whom
she had trusted, and that he would aid her to persevere. The fortune of her husband was not large.
But by a consistent economy, she was able to secure
every comfort, and to remember the poor.
It was now a matter of less consequence, than
when at school, which of the two ladies could boast
of the quickest perception, or the most brilliant intellect. But it was clear to every observer, whose
house was the seat of the greatest order, comfort,
and happiness. Ann still felt a sincere interest in
the welfare of her early friend, Emma, and visited
her as often as was in her power, seeking to extend
encouragement, or to impart sympathy.
Ann's widowed mother had'become infirm, and
given up her own house, to reside with her. This
excellent daughter had no higher pleasure than to

study her wishes, and try to repay a small part of
the debt of gratitude, incurred in infancy and childhood. Often would she say, with an affectionate
smile, "if there is any good thing in me, I owe it to
your counsel, and to His grace who enabled me to
persevere."
And when the old lady, with her silver locks
shading her venerable temples, bending from her
easy-chair, would tell her listening grandchildren,
by what means their dear mother became all that
was excellent, the little creatures, gathering closer to
her side, would say, with affecting earnestness, " We,
too, will learn to persevere."THE GIRL S READING-BOOK.
PFEIALE ENERGY.
IT is a pity that females should ever be brought
up in a helpless manner. It is a still greater pity,
when they think it not respectable to be industrious:
for then principles, as well as habit, have become
perverted. They ought to feel that their endowments qualify them for activity, and their duty demands it.
Our sex should begin, while young, to take an interest in the concerns of the family, and daily to
do something for its comfort. They should come
promptly and cheerfully to the aid of the mother in
her cares. They should inform themselves of the
amount of the yearly expenses of the household,
and keep an accurate account of their own.
Why should young girls be willing to be drones
in the domestic hive? In several families of the
highest respectability, the daughters supply by their
own industry, the resources of their charity. This
they do, not from necessity, but because it is pleasant to them, that their gifts to the poor should be
the fruit of their own earnings.
No female should consider herself educated, until
she is mistress of some employment or accomplishment, by which she might gain a livelihood, should
she be reduced to the necessity of supporting herself. The ancient Jews had a proverb, that whoever brought a child up without a trade, bound it
apprentice to vice.
Who can tell how soon they may be compelled

to do something for their own maintenance. How
many families, by unexpected reverses, are reduced
from affluence to poverty. How pitiful and contemptible, on such occasions, to see females helpless,
desponding, and embarrassing those whom it is
their duty to cheer and aid.
" I have lost my whole fortune," said a merchant,
as he returned one evening to his home. " We can
no longer ride in our carriage; we must leave this
large house. The children can no longer go to expensive schools. What we are to do for a living I
know not. Yesterday, I was a rich man. To-day,
there is nothing left that I can call my own."
"Dear husband," said the wife,' we are still rich
in each other, and our children. Money may pass
away, but God has given us a better treasure in
these active hands, and loving hearts." "Dear
father," said the little children, " do not look so
sober. We will help you to get a living."
"; What can you do, poor things?" said he. "You
shall see, you shall see," answered several cheerful
voices. "It is a pity, if we have been to school for
nothing. How can the father of eight healthy
children be poor? We shall work and make you
rich again."
"I shall help," said the youngest girl, hardly
four years old. " I will not have any new frock
bought, and I shall sell my great wax doll." The
heart of the husband and father, which had sunk in
his bosom like a stone, was lifted up. The sweet
enthusiasm of the scene cheered him, and his
nightly prayer was like a song of praise.

He left his stately house. The servants were dismissed. Pictures, and plate, and rich carpets and
furniture, were sold, and she who had been so long
the mistress of the mansion, shed no tear. " Pay
every debt," said she, "let no one suffer through
us, and we may yet be happy."
He took a neat cottage, and a small piece of
ground, a few miles from the city. With the aid of
his sons, he cultivated vegetables for the market.
He viewed with delight and astonishment, the
economy of his wife, nurtured as she had been in
wealth, and the efficiency which his daughters soon
acquired under her training.
The eldest ones assisted her in the work of the
household, and instructed the younger children.
Besides, they executed various works, which they
had learned as accomplishments, but which they
found could now be disposed of to, advantage.
They embroidered with taste, some of the ornamental parts of female apparel, which were readily
sold to merchants in the city.
They cultivated flowers, and sent bouquets to
market, in the cart that conveyed their vegetables.
They platted straw, they painted maps, they executed plain needle-work. Every one was at their
post, busy and cheerful. The cottage was like a
bee-hive.
"I never enjoyed such health before," said the
father. "And I was never as happy before," said
the mother. "We never knew how many things
we could do, when we lived in the great house,"
said the children, " and we love each other a great

Economy, as well as industry, was strictly observed. Nothing was wasted. Nothing unnecessary was purchased. After a while,the eldest daughter became assistant teacher in a distinguished
female seminary, and the second took her place, as
instructress to the family.
The little dwelling, which had always been kept
neat, they were soon able to beautify. Its construction was improved, and vines and floweringtrees were planted around it. The merchant was
happier under its woodbine-covered porch in a summer's evening, than he had been in his showy drawing-room.
" We are now thriving and prosperous," said he,

the wife, "where we have found health and contentment." " Father," said the youngest, "C all we

up in the nursery, and did not see much of you, or

were rich, and did not work. So, father, please not

bably arise from their being inured to more severe
exercise, especially those of the poorer classes.
Joanna Martin, the wife of a day-labourer in England, was left a widow with six small children, and
not a shilling for their support. The parish officers,
perceiving it to be a case of great distress, offered to
take charge of them. But the good mother resolved
to depend only upon the divine blessing, and her
own industry.
The life on which she entered, was one of extreme hardship. She rose at two in the morning,
and after doing what she could to make her little
ones comfortable, walked eight, and sometimes ten
miles, to the market-town, with a basket of potteryware on her head, which she sold, and returned
with the profits before noon.',.
By this hard labour, and the greatest economy,
she not only gained food and clothing for her children, but in the course of a year, saved the sum of
about seven dollars. Then, finding herself under
the necessity of quitting the cottage where she had
lived, she formed the resolution of building one for
herself.
Every little interval of time, which she could
spare from her stated toils, she devoted to working
upon the tenement which was to shelter her little
ones, and "with the assistance of a good God," said
she,'" I was able at last to finish my cottage." It
was small, but comfortable, and might remind those
who saw it, of what Cowper calls, " the peasant's
1nest."
After several years, Joanna, by persevering in

her industry and prudence, acquired enough to purchase a cart, and a small pony. "Now,"' said she
with delight, " I can carry pottery-ware to the different towns round about, and drive a pretty brisk
trade, for I begin to feel that I cannot walk thirty
miles a day, quite so well as when I was younger."
She lived to advanced age, respected for her honesty, patient diligence, and maternal virtues. It
was pleasant to observe the self'approbation and
simplicity with which she would say, when quite
old, "to be sure I am not very rich, but what I have
is all of my own getting. I never begged a halfpenny of any soul. I brought up my six children
without help from the overseers of the parish, and
can still maintain myself without troubling them for
assistance."
Many instances of the most laudable efforts to
obtain a support, might be mentioned among the
females of our own country. The disposition'to be
active in various departments of usefulness, ought
to be encouraged in the young, by those who have
charge of their education. The office of a teacher,
is one of the most respectable and delightful to
which they can aspire.
To instruct others is beneficial to the mind. It
deepens the knowledge which it already possesses,
and quickens it to acquire more. It is beneficial to
the moral habits. It teaches self-control. It moves
to set a good example. It improves the affections.

and their gratitude is a sweet reward.

Let the young females of the present generation,
distinguish themselves by energy in some useful
employment. Indolence and effeminacy are peculiarly unfit for the daughters of a republic. Let
them not shrink at reverses of fortune, but view
them as incitements to greater activity, and higher
virtue.
It was a wise man who said, "Virtue, like a precious odour, is most fragrant when crushed: for
prosperity doth best discover vice, but adversity
doth best discover virtue." When those we love
are in trouble, let us feel that we have a two-fold
office, to cheer, and to help them.
When man was first placed upon the earth,
woman was pronounced by the Almighty maker, a
" help-meet for him." If at any period of her life,
whether as daughter or sister, as wife or mother,
she draws back from being a helper, and through
indolence becomes a burden,-she forgets her duty
to him, and violates the command of her Creator.

THE WIFE OF THE INTEMPERATE.
JANE HARWOOD, with her husband and children,
made one among the many families who remove
to the unplanted,western wild. The change from
the manner of life in which she had been brought
up in her native New England,was great. But she
never complained, and busied herself with those
duties which befit the wife of a lowly emigrant.
One of her principal cares was an invalid boy.
The charge of his health, and of his mind, occupied
her most anxious thoughts. She supplicated that
the pencil which was to write upon his soul, and
which seemed to be placed in her hand, might be
guided from above. She spoke to him in the tenderest manner of his Father in heaven, and of his
will respecting little children.
She pointed out almighty goodness in the daily
gifts that sustain life; in the glorious sun rejoicing
in the east; in the gently-falling rain; the frail
plants, and the dews that nourish them. She rea-'soned with him of the changes of nature, till he
loved even the storm and the lofty thunder, because
they came from God.
She repeated to him passages of Scripture, with
which her memory was stored, and sang hymns,,until she perceived that if he was in pain he complained not, if he might but hear her voice. She
made him acquainted with the life of the compassionate Redeemer, how he took young children in
his arms, though the disciples forbade them. And

a voice from within, urged her never to desist from
cherishing that tender and deep-rooted piety, because, like the flower of grass, he must soon pass
away.
Jane Harwood had a different, and a still deeper
trial, in the intemperance of her husband. In his
fits of intoxication, there was no form of persecution
which distressed her so much, as unkindness to the
feeble and suffering boy. On such occasions, it was
in vain that she attempted to protect him. She
might neither shelter him in her bosom, nor control
the frantic violence of the father.
The timid boy, in terror of his,natural protector,
withered like a crushed flower. It was of no avail
that neighbours remonstrated with the unfeeling
parent, or that hoary-headed men warned him solemnly of his sins. Intemperance had destroyed
his respect for man, and his fear of God.
The wasted and wild-eyed invalid, shrank from
the glance and footstep of his father, as firom the
approach of a foe. Harshness, and the agitation of
fear, deepened a disease that might else have yielded. Returning spring brought no gladness to the
declining child. Consumption laid its hand upon
his vitals, and his nights were restless and full of
pain.
"Mother, I wish I could once more smell the violets that grew upon the green bank, by our old, dear
home." " It is too early for violets, my child; but
the grass is growing bright and beautiful around us,
and the birds sing sweetly, as if their little hearts
were full of praise."  The mother knew that his

hectic fever had been recently increasing, and saw
that there was a strange brightness in his eye.
Seating herself on his low bed, she bowed her
face to his to sootlihe and coimipose him. "Mother,
do you think my father will come?"  Dreading the
alarm which, in his paroxysms of coughing, he
evinced at his father's approach, she answered, "I
think not, love; you had better try to sleep."
M" Mother, I wish he would come. I am not afraid
now. Perhaps he would let me lay my cheek to
his, once more, as he used to do, when I was a babe
in my grandmother's arms. I should be glad to say
a kind good bye to him, before I go to my Saviour."
Gazing earnestly in his face, she saw the work of
the destroyer. " My son! my dear son! say, Lord
Jesus receive my spirit." " Mother," he replied,
with a smile upon his ghastly features, " he is ready
for me. I am willing to go to him. Hold the baby
to me, that I may kiss her once more. That is all.
Now sing to me; and oh! wrap me closer in your
arms, for I shiver with cold."
He clung, with the death-grasp, to that bosom
which had long been his sole earthly refuge.;" Sing
louder, a little louder, dearest mother, I cannot hear
you." Tremulous tones, like those of a broken
harp, rose above her grief, to comfort the dying
child. One sigh of icy breath was upon her cheek,
as she joined it to his, one shudder, and all was
ovor.
She stretched the body on thle bed, and kneeling
beside it, hid her face in that grief which none but
mothers feel. It was a deep and sacred solitude--THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
alone with the dead. Only the soft breathings of
the sleeping babe were heard. Then the silence
was broken by a piercing voice of supplication for
strength to endure. The petition, which began in
weakness, closed in faith. It became a prayer of
thanksgiving to him who had released the dove-like
spirit from its prison house of pain, to share the bliss
of angels.
She arose from'her knees, and bent cahlmly over
the dead. The placid features wore the same smile
as when he had spoken of Jesus. She smoothed
the shining locks around the pure forehead, and
gazed long on what was to her so beautiful. Amid
her tears was an expression, chasiened and sublime,
as of one who gives a cherub back to God.
The father entered carelessly. She pointed to
the pale, immoveable brow.'See, he no longer
suffers." He drew near, and looked with surprise
on the dead. A few natural tears forced their way,
and fell upon the face of the first-born, who was
once his pride. He even spoke tenderly to the
emaciated mother, and she, who a few moments
before, felt raised above the sway of grief, wept like
an infant, as those few affectionate tones touched
the sealed fountains of other years.
James Harwood returned from the funeral of the
child in much mental distress. His sins were brought
to remembrance, and reflection was misery. Sleep
was disturbed by visions of his neglected boy. In
broken dreams, he fancied that he heard him cough
ing from his low bed, as he was wont to do. Withi
a strange disposition of kindness he felt constrained

to go to him, but his limbs refused their office. Then
a little, thin, dead, hand, would be thrust froin the
dark giave, and beckon him to follow to the unseen
world.
While conscience thus haunted him with terrors,
many prayers arose from pitying and pious hearts,
that he might now be led to repentance. There
was, indeed, a change in his habits; and she, who
was above all others interested in his reformation,
spared no effort to win him back to the path of
virtue, and to sooth his accusing spirit into peace
with itself, and obedience to its God.
Yet was she doomed to witness the full force of
the conflict of grief and remorse against intemperance, only to see them suddenly overthrown. The
reviving goodness, with whose promise she had so
solaced herself, as even to give thanks that her beloved son had not died in vain, was transient as the
morning-dew. Habits of industry, which seemed to
have been springing up, proved themselves to be
without root.
The dead, and his cruelty to the dead, were alike
forgotten. Disaffection to that tender and trusting
wife, who "against hope, had believed in hope,"
resumed its habitual sway. The friends who had
alternately reproved and encouraged him, felt that
their efforts were of no avail. Intemperance, like
the " strong man armed," took final possession of a
soul, that lifted no prayer for aid to the Holy Spirit,
and ceased to stir itself up to struggle with the
destroyer.
To lay waste the comfort of his wife, seemed nowTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.1
tlhe principal object of this miserable man. Day
after day, did she witness for herself and for her
household, the fearful changes of his causeless anger
and brutal tyranny. She felt the utter necessity of
deriving consolation, and the power of endurance,
wholly from above.
She was faithful in the discharge of the difficult
duties that devolved upon her, and especially careful not to irritate him by reproaches or a gloomy
countenance. Yet she could not sometimes prevent
from rising mournfillly to her view, her sweet native
village,-the peaceful home and fond friends of her
childhood so far away,-and the constant, endearing attentions, which won her early love for one
whose ill-treatment now strewed her path with
thorns.
In this new and solitary settlement, she had no
relative to protect her from his insolence; she felt
that she was entirely in his power,-that it was a
power without gerieirosity,-and that there is no
tyranny so entire and terrible, as that of an alienated
and intemperate husband.
Still, looking to her Father in Heaven, she found
her courage revive, and deepen into a childlike confidence. After putting her children to'bed, as she
sat alone, evening after evening,-while the joys of
early days, and the sorrows of maturity, passed in
review before her, she questioned her heart what
had been its gain from Heaven's discipline, and
whether she was to sustain that greatest of all
losses, the loss of the spiritual benefit intended by
affliction.

The absences of her husband grew more frequent and protracted. Once, during the third night
of his departure, she knew not where, she lay sleepless, listening for his footsteps. Sometimes she fancied she heard his shouts of wild laughter, but it
was only the shriek of the tempest. Then, she
thought the sounds of his frenzied anger rang in her
ears. It was the roar of the hoarse wind through
the forest.
All night long she listened to these tumults, and
hushed and sang to her affrighted babe. Early in
the morning, her eye was attracted by a group coming up slowly from the river which ran near her
dwelling. A terrible foreboding came upon her.
She thought they bore a corpse. It was, indeed, the
corpse of her husband. He had been drowned, as it
was supposed, during the darkness of the preceding
night, while attempting to cross a bridge of logs,
which had been broken by the swollen waters.
Utter prostration of spirit canie over the desolate
mourner. Her energies were broken, and her heart
withered. She had sustained the hardships of emigration and the privations of poverty, the burdens
of unceasing toil and unrequited care, without murmuring. She had laid her first-born in the grave,
with resignation, for faith had heard her Redeemer
saying, "Suffer the little one to come unto me."
She had seen him, in whom her heart's young affections were garnered up, become a prey to vice
the most disgusting and destructive. Yet she had
borne up under all. One hope had lingered with
her, as an " anchor of the soul," the hope that heTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.     131
might yet repent and be reclaimed. But now he
had died in his sin. The deadly leprosy which had
stolen over his heart, could no more be " purged
with sacrifice, or offering, forever."
She knew not that a single prayer for mercy had
preceded the soul on its passage to the judge's bar.
There were bitter dregs in this cup of wo. which
she had never before tasted. With heaviness of an
unspoken and peculiar nature, was the victim of
intemperance borne from the house that he had
troubled, and buried by the side of his son, to whose
tender years he had been an unnatural enemy.
And among those who surrounded his open grave,
there was sorrow. bearing the features of that fearful " sorrow which is without hope."132         THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.;I HAVE SEEN AN END OF ALL PERFECTI ON.99-IPsalms.
I HAVE seen a man in the glory of his days, in the
pride of his strength. He was built like the strong
oak, that strikes its root deep in the earth--like the
tall cedar, that lifts its head above the trees of the
forest.
He feared no danger,-he felt no sickness.-he
wondered why any should groan or sigh at pain.
His mind was vigorous like his body. He was perplexed at no intricacy, he was daunted at no obstacle. Into hidden things he searched. and what was
crooked he made plain.
He went forth boldly upon the face of the mighty
deep. He surveyed the nations of the earth. He
measured the distances of the stars, and called them
by their names. He gloried in the extent of his
knowledge, in the vigour of his understanding, and.
strove to search even into what the Almighty had
concealed.
And when I looked upon him, I said with the
poet, "what a piece of work is man? how noble in
reason-! how infinite in faculties! in form  and
moving, how express and admirable! in action,
how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a
god!"
I returned-but his look was no more lofty, nor
his step proud. His broken frame was like some
ruined tower. His hairs were white and scattered,
and his eye gazed vacantly upon the passers by.THE GIRL'S READING-BOO1K.
The vigour of his intellect was wasted, and of all
that he had gained by study, nothing remained.
He feared when there was no danger, and when
there was no sorrow, he wept. His decaying
memory had become treacherous. It showed him
only broken images of the glory' that was departed.
His house was to him like a strange land, and his
friends were counted as enemies. He thought himself strong and healthful, while his feet tottered on
the verge of the grave.
He said of his son, " he is my brother;" of his
daughter, "I know her not." He even inquired
what was his own name. And as I gazed mournfully upon him, one who supported his feeble frame
and ministered to his many wants, said to me, " Let
thine heart receive instruction, for thou hast seen
an end of all perfection."
I have seen a beautiful female, treading the first
stages of youth, and entering joyfully into the pleasures of life. The glance of her eye was variable
and sweet, and on her cheek trembled something
like the first blush of morning; her lips moved, and
there was melody; and when she floated in the
dance, her light form, like the aspen, seemed to
move with every breeze.
I returned-she was not in the dance. I sought
her among her gay companions, but I found tr
not. Her eye sparkled not there, the music of her
voice was silent. She rejoiced on earth no more.
I saw a train, sable, and slow-paced. Sadly they

and beautiful. As they drew near, they paused, and
a voice broke the solemn silence.
"Man, that is born of a woman, is of few days:
and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower,
and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and
never continueth in one stay."
Then they let down into the deep, dark pit, that
maiden whose lips, but a few days since, were like
the half blowni rosebud. I shuddered at the sound
of clods falling upon the hollow coffin.
Then I heard a voice saying, "earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust." They covered her
with the damp soil, and the uprooted turf of the
valley, and turned again to their own homes.
But one mourner lingered to cast himself upon
the tomb. And as he wept, he said, "there is no
beauty, nor grace, nor loveliness, but what vanisheth like the morning dew. I have seen an end of
all perfection."
I saw a fair white dwelling, behind shady trees.
Flowers were cultivated around it. The clustering
vine wreathed above its door, and the woodbine
looked in at its windows. A mother was there fondling her young babe. Another, who had just learned to lisp its first wishes, sat on the father's knee.
He looked on them all, with a loving smile, and a
heart full of happiness.

dead at the root. Weeds towered where the woodbine blossomed, and tangled grass sprung up by the
threshold where many feet used to tread. There

was no sound of sporting children, or of the mother
singing to her babe.
I turned my steps to the church-yard. Three
new mounds were added there. That mother slept
between her sons. A lonely man was bowing down
there, whose face I did not see. But I knew his
voice, when he said in his low prayer of sorrow,
"Thou hast made desolate all my company." The
tall grass rustled and sighed in the cold east wind.
Methought it said, " See, an end of all perfection."
I saw an infant with a ruddy brow, and a form
like polished ivory. Its motions were graceful, and
its merry laughter made other hearts glad. Sometimes it wept, and again it rejoiced, when none knew
why. But whether its cheek dimpled with smiles,
or its blue eye shone more brilliant thirough tears,
it was beautiful.
It was beautiful, because it was innocent. And
care-worn and sinful men, admired, when they beheld it. It was like the first blossom which some
cherished plant has put forth, whose cup sparkles
with a dew-drop, and whose head reclines, upon the
parent-stem.
Again- I looked. It had become a child. The
lamp of reason htad beamed into its mind. It was
simple, and single-hearted, and a follower of the
truth. It loved every little bird that sang in the
trees, and every fresh blossom. Its heart danced
with joy, as it looked around on this good and pleasant world.
It stood like a lamb before its teachers, it bowed
its ear to instruction, it walked in the way of know135136         THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
ledge. It was not proud or stubborn or envious;
and it had never heard of the vices and vanities of
the world. And when I looked upon it, I remembered our Saviour's words, " Except ye become as
little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of
heaven."
I saw a man whom the world calls honourable.
Many waited for his smile. They pointed to the
fields that were his, and talked of the silver and gold
which he had gathered. They praised the stateliness of his domes, and extolled the honour of his
family.
But the secret language of his heart was, "by my
wisdom have I gotten all this." So he returned no
thanks to God, neither did he fear or serve him.
As I passed along, I heard the complaints of the
labourers who had reaped his fields, and the cries
of the poor, whose covering he had taken away.
The sound of feasting and revelry was in his
mansion, and the unfed beggar camne tottering from
his door. But he considered not that the cries of
the oppressed were continually entering into the
ears of the Most High.
And when I knew that this man was the docile
child whom I had loved, the beautiful infant on
whom I had gazed with delight, I said in my bitterness, " Ihave seen an end of all perfection." So I

MIIRS. ELIZABETH ROWE.
MRs. ELIZABETH ROWE was born at Ilchester, in
England, September 11th, 1674. Her parents were
distinguished for integrity, benevolence, and piety.
In early childhood, she displayed a desire to profit
by-their precepts and follow their example.
She had an only sister, whom she tenderly loved.
They always wished to be together. Side by side,
they studied, worked, warbled the same, hymn, and
had no idea of a separate enjoyment. But the eldest,
was smitten in her youth and loveliness, and the
lonely survivor walked on, with the burden of a
deep sorrow.
This affliction seemed to deepen the religious impressions which from early life she had cherished.
It brought the thoughts of the eternal world more
near, and humbled her in the most solemn acts of
devotion. In the pursuit of knowledge, she was
also persevering and successful.
With the French and Italian languages, she became familiar. Painting, music, and poetry she had
practised from a child. Her love of the latter predominated, and she found it both a solace in grief,
and a heightener of every pleasure. At the age of
twenty-two, a volume of her poems was published,
which attracted attention and praise.
But her uncommon accomplishments, and the admiration they received, created no vanity. She
was remarked for her unaffected manners, sweetness of disposition, and active benevolence. She

even made herself acquainted with the study of
medicine, that she might relieve the indigent sick,
who were unable to pay a physician, and they viewed her as a guardian angel.
She married Mr. Thomas Rowe, a man of distinguished talents and attainments, who warmly reciprocated the attachment of her refined and affectionate spirit. But only five years of conjugal happiness was allotted them; and after his lamented
death, she retired to a solitary estate in Frome,
where she sought to comfort her widowhood by intellectual pursuits, and works of charity.

parted friends, and made herself so familiar in
thought with the world of spirits, that she was induced to compose a volume of "Letters from the
Dead to the Living." These were followed by
"Letters, Moral and Entertaining," where she
endeavours by fictitious examples, to expose the
deformity of vice, and allure to the practice of
virtue.
She wrote other books, among which were the
History of Joseph," and "Devout Exercises of the
Heart." So great was her fondness for study and
writing, that though her society was courted by
families of rank and opulence, she quitted her beloved retirement with reluctance, and returned to it
with increased delight.
Still, she had the kindest social feelings, and her
manners were a model of unaffected politeness.
She excelled in conversation, as well as with her
pen. The most elegant language flowed from herTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.     139
lips, she spoke gracefully, and her tone of voice
was singularly sweet and harmonious.
Though she was agreeable, and even beautiftul in
her person, she did not sacrifice her time to the
decorations of dress. She was always neat in her
apparel, but did not allow the toilet to interfere
with nobler pursuits. For empty ceremony and
ostentatious fashion, she had neither time nor taste.
She discountenanced every kind of luxury. She
preferred to have her table simply spread, and devote
to the poor the money which would have loaded it
with dainties. She felt that the pampering of the
appetite was unworthy of beings fitted for higher
pleasures, and formed for immortality.
She was affable and courteous to persons in humble stations. Her domestics she treated with the
utmost kindness. She sa'w that they had every
needful attention in sickness, and often sat by their
bedside, reading them books of useful instruction
and pious counsel.
Hler heart was eminently formed for friendship.
She rendered every service in her power to those
whom she loved. By a warm and generous sympathy, she made their sorrows her own. She was
candid and tender, in pointing out their faults, and
above all, strove to win their hearts to the love of
that true, piety which had rendered her life so
happy.
I-ler charities were extensive. The greatest part

as much as we please? Not without labour. The
quantity of what we remember, depends as mpch
on industry, as the quality does on the taste and
turn of mind.
Do you find it difficult to remember what you
study? Quicken the motive. If a horse is dull, the
rider touches him with the spur. Believe that your
memory may be equally unlder your own control.
But you must take painls to acquire that control.
Think of the loss that you sustain in devoting
time to the acquisition of knowledge, yet suffering
that knowledge to escape. Suppose a farmer, after
labouring through the season, should neglect to mow
his grass, or to reap his wheat after it had ripened,
or to gather his corn into the granary. Suppose a
merchant should neglect to balance the accounts of
the year, or to call in what was due, or to invest his
surplus money where it would be safe and profitable?
Would you not say that both the farmer and the muerchant were exceedingly unwise? -Yet you are more
so, if you go to school and neglect to store the treasures of knowledge. For to you, there can be no second season of youth, in which to glean the sheaves
you have neglected to gather, or the gold which
should have been locked in memory's store-house
for the winter of age.
Sometimes you say that you cannot remember.
Is it true? If it is, you will always be inferior to
those who can. You will be ruled by them, as a

willing it should be so? If not, open the eyes of

titute of comforts. She worked with her own hands
to relieve their necessities. Tears flowed down her
cheeks at a tale of distress, and not content with
sending bounty, she visited in person, the hovels of
poverty and contagion.
She gave books to the ignorant. She educated
poor children, supplied them with clothing, and instructed them herself in the principles of the christian religion. Such was her reputation for benevolence, that the indigent from neighbouring villages
resorted to her, and shared in her alms and her sympathies.
One of her great excellencies, was a most sweet
and amiable disposition. She was unruffled by the
common crossing incidents of life, those petty obstructions, which throw the temper off its guard
more than real afflictions. Neither infirmities, or
advancing age, disturbed this serenity.
Servants, who had lived with her for nearly
twenty years, never saw her out of temper. Indeed,
it has been said, that she was not known throughout her whole life, to utter an unkind or an ill-natured expression. To scandal and calumny she had a
most rooted aversion, and defended the reputation
of others, as far as was in her power.
Her talent for conversation, she made use of as a
means, not merely of imparting pleasure, but of
(loing good. When she wished to excite a person
to the practice of any particular virtue, she sometimes delicately praised those who had been eminent for it, hoping they might thus, by the beauty
of example, be quickened to imitation.
140THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
All her deportment was marked by true humility.
And though her excellence could not shield her
from enmity, and from the slanders of that envy
which follows eminent goodness, and " like the
shadow proves the substance true," she avoided resentment, and considered herself thus called upon
to exercise the christian virtue of forgiveness.
She was strict in the observances of religion.
She adopted the rule of the Psalmist, " evening and
morning and noon, will I pray;" and retired three
times a day for stated private devotion. In the
duties of the Sabbath she was exemplary, caused
the Scriptlres to be daily read in her family, and
attended the sacrament of the Lord's supper, with
great veneration and love.
A life so blameless, a trust so firm in God, a mind
so conversant with a future and better world, seemed to have divested death of terror. He came as a
messenger to conduct her to that state of purity and
bliss, for which she had been so long preparing.
A short time before the event, though in perfect
health, she mentioned to a religious friend a conviction that she should soon depart, wrote several
solemn and affectionate letters, not to be communicated till after her decease, and a paper, giving directions for a plain and private funeral, and a grave
without monument or inscription.
On the day of her death, she was in perfect health,
spent the evening cheerfully with a friend, and retired at the usual hour to her chamber. There, she
was soon after found by her servant, prostrate on
the floor, and at the last gasp.

She died on Sunday, February 28th, 1737. A religious book was found open by her, and a paper ont
which she had written a few devout thoughts. It
was her stated hour for prayer. Probably, her soul
while in sublimated communion with her God, passed to "his presence, where is fulness of joy; to his
right hand, where are pleasures forevermore."TIE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
MRS. JERUSIIA LATHROP.
MRS. JERUSHA LATHROP was born at Hartford,
Conn., May 10th, 1717. She was the daughter of
Governor Talcott, and enjoyed the benefit of the
example of pious parents. She early displayed an
amiable disposition, a mind of quick and strong
powers, and an affectionate heart.
In those days, the advantages of school-education
could not be obtained, as they now are, by all. The
colony had been settled but little more than eighty
years. The hardships of those, who had found it a
wilderness, were freshly remembered. Simplicity
of.living, and industrious habits, still prevailed
among the most wealthy families.
The subject of this sketch used often to remark,
that she was never in a school-house in her life.
Still she received a good education. The family of
her parents was a school for her, aild their precept
and example were her teachers. There she learned
what fitted her for this life and the next.
Obedience and diligence were the first letters in
her alphabet. Lessons of piety began at her cradle,
and domestic industry with her early childhood.
She soon acquired the use of the needle and knitting-needles in all their varieties. The foundation of
good housekeeping, in which she excelled throughout her life. was laid by her mother, who permitted
her to be an assistant in her own employments,
while she was yet a child.
Her intellectual culture was not neglected. She
14a3THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
had a great fondness for reading and writing. Her
acquaintance with the standard authors of the Eniglish language was thorough, and in poetry she took
high and deep delight. There were then but few
books. Yet from this scarcity she derived the benefit of reading with such careful attention, as to impress their contents deeply on her memory, and
carry what she learned in youth, to the close of a
long life.
She possessed herself of the accomplishments
which entered into the education of the daughters
of the wealthy. They were required by her station.
Instrumental music was not then numbered among
-them. But she became an adept in vocal music, and
had the gift of a voice of great compass and melody.
Embroidery was much prized, and she excelled in
it. Chairs, curtains, toilets, and other useful and
ornamental articles, attested her skill and persevering industry. To her many other attainments, she
added gentle, graceful, and dignified manners, that
accomplishiment which is admired by all, and which
never goes out of fashion. She was taught the precept, that the richest dress might beconme antiquated, and the most beautiful face grow old, but good
manners were a garb fitting for every occasion, and
a language understood in all lands.
At the age of eighteen, she was married to Dr.
Daniel Lathrop, of Norwich, Conn. He was a man
of excellent talents and principles, and to the best
education which this country afforded, had added
the advantage of several years residence in Europe.
His mind was enlarged by literary and scientific re144THE GIRLrS READING-BOOK.     145
search, and it was his pleasure to employ his fortune
in encouraging industrious enterprise, and drawing
merit from obscurity.
The young wife entered upon her new duties
with affectionate energy, and trust in Divine aid.
She made home a delightful spot to her husband,
and reciprocated his affection and confidence. She
cheered by respect and attention the last days of
his aged father. She looked well to the ways of
her household, guided her servants with discretion,
and convinced them that she felt a sincere interest
in their welfare and improvement.
Moving in an elevated sphere, considered the ornament and pride of the society in which she mingled, and surrounded by all the elements of conjugal
felicity, the piety which early struck deep root in
her soul, gave her wisdom beyond her years, and
preserved her from the pride of prosperity. In the
important responsibilities of a mother; she was faithful and exemplary.
She was blessed with three sons, beautiful in person, and in mind. The eldest displayed great maturity of intellect and character. He delighted to
sit as a solitary student, and store his memory with
sacred and sublime passages from the best authors.
The religious instructions of his mother were his
delight, and often, at his hour of retiring, he would
ask with an interesting solemnity, "Do you think I
have done any thing to-day to offend my Father in
Heaven" -?

ther's, as a bud opens illto the perfect flower. The
youngest, when he completed his third year, was
tile picture of health, vigour, and joy. Golden curls
clus~tered around his broad, lofty forehead, and his
beautiful features were radiant with the glow of
intelligence, or the gladness of mirth.
The eldest, the little student as he was called,
had attained the age of seven years. Suddenly he
was smitten, while at his books, with a fatal disease.
One night he suffered; the next, he was not among
the living. Ere he was laid in the tomb, the second
drooped. Tears quivered in his soft blue eyes, like
dew in the bell of the hyacinth. Yet. if he might
lay his head upon his mother's bosom, he would
endure without repining.
The dying boy pressed his mother to sing the
hymn that he loved. She controlled her griel, to
cheer him once more with its trembling harmony.
It was then that he breathed away his soul, whispering of the angels and their celestial melodies.
The youngest was next taken. So strongly did he
struggle with the destroyer, and so fearful were
his agonies and convulsions, that those who best
loved him, could not but give thanks when the
beautiful clay was at peace.
These three lovely children were laid in one
grave, in one week. The bereaved parents ever
continued childless. The mother was in her twentysixth year when this affliction came upon her. She
looked to him who had ordained it. She strove to

herself to sustain and cheer her sorrowing husband,
and laid open the burden of her griefs only to the
Father of her spirit.
She seriously examined her heart, to know what
evil or error it cherished, to render such severe discipline necessary. This solemn inquiry is revealed
in a poem,which she composed during the earlier
stages of her mourning, from which we extract the
following lines, as a specimen of the earnestness
with which she desired to be made better by the
sorrow that had pierced her heart.
"Oh, teach me why thou dost contend, and say
Thy comforts blasted, hasten to decay;
Teach me the paths wherein I go astray;
Reveal the secret errors of my way;
Reform, correct, subdue the offending mind,
Too often stubborn, impotent, or blind."
A visible blessing descended upon her prayers
that this bereavement might be sanctified to her
improvement in piety. Her wounded sensibilities
subsided into that resignation which brings peace,
and into an untiring benevolence. Her sympathies
were quickened for all who mourned, and she relieved the children of sorrow and poverty with the
benignity of an angel.
It wras late in life,when the affliction of widowhood came upon her. She was appointed to watch
over her husband,during the pains of a protracted
sickness, and to mark with still keener anguish the
mental decay of him, who had been her dearest
friend and coullsellor. "I have seen an end of all
perfection," said she, when his strong and brilliant
147THE GIRL'S READING-B00K.
mind yielded to the pressure of sickness, and when
he was laid in the grave she put her whole trust in
the widow's God.
From that hour,she derived her chief solace from
doing good. She seemed to love the poor,as if they
were unfortunate members of her own family.
They came to her and received food and clothing,
kind words, and religious counsel. Her care for
those in distress knew no pause while life lasted.
Indeed, it extended beyond it, as she left in her will
a considerable sum,for the payment of the taxes of
the poor.
A few miles from the city where she resided, was
the remnant of a once powerful tribe of Indians.
They had been invariably friendly to our ancestors.
They had supplied them with corn, during the
famine that sometimes oppressed the infant colony,
and had shed their blood in the defence of their
white friends. Now they had become poor and
despised. Their royal family was extinct, and they
were asstrangers in the land of their fathers.
For them her sympathies were enlisted. She
proportioned her bounties to their needs.  Her
friendly words, and courteous deportment, were a
cordial to their withered hearts. Particularly at
the stated festivals of Christmas, and thanksgiving,
they were remembered. And when they thronged
to receive the bounty which she had provided for
them, she was often seen to regard their meek and
abject countenances with a tearful, tender glance,
remembering that they were once the lords of the
soil.
148THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
The pooI' red people of the forest, and the sable
Afiican, she regarded with pitying kindness. She
strove to elevate their condition, and to cheer them
with hope, and to impress on them the importance
of right conduct, assuring them that their souls were
precious in the eye of a Redeemer. She informed herself of the state of the sick poor, and sent
them l)ortions according to their necessities. Her
benefactions often came so secretly, that the relieved
party knew not from whence they flowed, for she
desired not the praise of man.
There was nothing in which she more delighted
than to do good to children. She assisted in the
education of those, whose parents were in restricted
circumstances, and distributed useful books to those
who were unable to purchase them. She formed
an acquaintance with the teachers of schools, and
rewarded such of their pupils as distinguished thermselves by good scholarship, and correct deportment.
She loved to surround herself on Saturday afternoons, with the children of the neighbourhood. She
interested.them with delineations of birds, plants,
and animals, which, with her scissors or pencil, she
rapidly and skilfully executed. She charmed them
with the melody and high sentiment of her ancient
songs, or touched their hearts with the devout hymins
with which her memory was stored. She drew
them around lier table, and dismissed them at sunset, with some simple present, made happier and
better by the sacred inistructions which she mingled
with her deeds of kindness.

It is not to scholars alone, that the retentive power is important. Think of a housekeeper without a
memory,-running hither and thither,-forgetting
her own directions,,nd not able to find the articles
which she daily needs. Would not her servants
take advantage of her, and even her neighbours despise her?
Is it indeed true that you have no memory?
Then your mind is a cripple. Put it on crutches,
and do with it as well as you can. But do not proclaim its infirmities. Do not say Ihave forgotten,
and feel no shame. You do not like to have your
faults published. At least you are not bound to proclaim them yourself.
Let us rather believe that you have a good memory, or at least that you will take pains to make it so.
If you desired a boy to be active and healthy, would
you confine him to the house and to walk always on
a carpet? Would you not say to him, "go, and
climb the rocks, and work in the open air." So, give
your memory daily exercise, and do not shrink from
that which is severe.
When you read or hear what you wish to remember, think of nothing else. Fix your attention, till
you have done studying or listening. Think it over,
and repeat it to yourself, till it is well committed.

oringing up some poor or orphan child as a domestic. Many of these repaid her in their future lives,
by their respectability and piety, and felt that it was
a privilege to have grown up under the shadow of
her wisdom. In the arrangement of her household,
she united prudence with a liberal hospitality. She
economized in her personal expenditure, that she
might have the more to give to those who needed.
She prized the intercourse of friendship.  She
received friends at her house in a simple, unostentatious manner, and delighted them with her intelligent and instructive conversation. Especially she
showed attention and respect to the ministers of
religion, and required all under her care to treat
them with reverence. Fondness for reading, filled
the little vacancies of life, and the strong and kind
interest she took in those around, particularly in all
the young, served to keep her mind unimpaired,
and her feeliiigs vivid.
When more than fourscore years of age, her light

fine forehead, scarcely fiurrowed, a clear, expressive
eye, a tall and graceful person, whose symmetry

manners, rendered her an object of interest to all
who approached her. To the last, her voice retained
that musical ard exquisite tone, which seemed an
echo of the so il's harmony.

amid the frosts of age, for their root was an everliving piety. There is no doubt that her afflictions
contribuited to her excellence. For when they fell
upon her, with what seemed a crushing weight, she
cast away the selfishness of grief, and took hold of
the anchor of faith, and the crown of charity.
The close of her life was like the fading of a serene sabbath into the holy quiet of its evening. As
she entered her eighty-ninth year, a gentle sickness
was the herald of the last messenger. On the morning of September 14th, 1805, her spirit departed.
So peaceful was the transition, that the precise moment when she ceased to breathe, could not be told
by those who watched over her pillow with ardent
and grateful love. "But I heard a voice from heaven, saying, WVrite, blessed are the dead that die in

IRSIl. HANNAH [iORE.
MRS. HANNAH MORE was born in the year 1745, at
Stapleton, in the county of Gloucester, England.
She was the youngest but one, of five sisters. Her
father received a learned education, and was intended for the ministry. But a reverse of fortune
changed his destination, and he became the teacher
of a school, which, with close economy, afforded
him a support.
Mrs. More's mother was the daughter of a farmer.
She had received only a plain education; but her
strong mind, good sense, and sound judgment, and
the active part she took in the formation of her
children's early habits, contributed essentially to
their future success and distinction.
The subject of this memoir, when very young,
exhibited great quickness of perception, and thirst
for knowledge. By listening to the lessons given
to her elder sisters, she made considerable progress
in reading, at three years old, and learned to repeat
the Catechism in such a manner as to call forth
the wondering admiration of the minister of the
parish.
At eight, she was continually asking her father
about ancient history and the classics. As his library
was not furnished with the authors which he had
himself studied, he used to gratify her by opening
the stores of his own retentive memory. Seated on
his knee, the little girl listened with eager attention
to the revolutions of Greece and Rome, and to theTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.      153
most striking events that diversify the page of
history.
He recited to her the speeches of heroes, first in
their original languages, to gratify her ear with the
sound. Then he translated them into English. The
parallel characters and precepts of Plutarch, were a
favourite part of these fireside discourses. Perhaps
thus was unconsciously laid, the foundation for that
high morality which pervaded her future writings.
He began also to instruct her in Latin and mathematics. So astonishing was her progress, that he
began to be alarmed lest'her mind should be turned
entirely from the duties of her sex. I-He ceased his
instruction in these sciences. But she pursued by
herself the Latin classics, and so thoroughly were
the rudiments, imparted by her father, engraved
upon her docile mind, that she used ever to say,
that conversation with an enlightened parent, or
preceptor, was one of the best modes of education.
At a still earlier age, whenever she could possess
herself of a scrap of paper, it was her delight to
cover it entirely with some little essay or poem.
One of her highest anticipations was, that she might
one day be rich enough to have a whole quire of
paper. So strilking were some of the thoughts and
expressions that she communicated nightly to the
sister with whom she slept, that she would sometimes rise, and endeavour to procure a light, and
the cover of some old letter, on which to write
HIannah's effusions, lest they should escape from
memnory.
The eldest of her sisters was sent to school at154         THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
Bristol, that she might qualify herself for a teacher.'At the close of every week she returned home, and
diligently taught her sisters wlhat she had herself
gained. This was the foundation of the education
of the distinguished Hannah More; the knowledge
gathered from the lips of parents and sisters, during
the usual occupations of the famiily.
She thus acquired the French language, and by
improving every opportunity, of conversing in it,
when she met with natives of that country, of cultivated minds, became distinguished for its free and
elegant use. In every study which she attempted,
her diligence and perseverance knew no interruption.  She felt the full importance of acquiring
knowledge, and made vigorous efforts to that end.
Her love of goodness, was equal to her love of'
knowledge, and God crowned both with success.
When she was twelve years old, her three elder
sisters commenced a boarding-school at Bristol, and
took her under their care. The eldest was then
but twenty years of age, yet, with such ability and
discretion was the establishment conducted, that it
immediately gained and preserved a very high reputation.
The young teachers laboured to instil into the
minds of their pupils, the same exalted sense of morality, and deep religious principle, which had formed
the basis of their own domestic education. They
never ceased to acknowledge the value of the instruction of their pious parents, and the pains they
had taken to impress on their hearts the sanctity of
the sabbath, and of the ordinances of religion.TIHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
Their talented sister was careful to obey all their
rules. She testified her gratitude for the heightened
advantages of education which she enjoyed through
their exertions. It was to aid them in furnlshing
their scholars with some interesting and moral composition to commit to memory, and recite, that she
wrote the pastoral drama of the "Search after Happiness."
Thus it seems that her sweet, sisterly feeling
prompted her, when scarcely seventeen years old,
to take the first step in that career of authorship,
where, for the long period of seventy years, she
was to walk, improving and enlightening the world.
Before she arrived at the age of thirty, she became
generally known as a writer of great ability, and
the praises of her learning and genius, reached her
from the lips of the most illustrious in the realm.
True piety preserved her from the vanity which
must else have destroyed her. She mingled in the
circles of rank and fashion, only to return with a
wider experience, and a warmer zeal, to the labours
of love that she had marked out for herself. She
tasted of the world, that she might overcome it.
She was raised above its temptations, by the grace
of Him whom she had sought in her youth, whose
oye is ever upon "them that fear him, that hope in
his mercy."'
We have not room, here to mnention the various
character of her numerous and excellent works.
But her intellectual labours did not turn her attention from the duties of religion and charity. After
the retirement of her sisters from the school for
155156          THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
young ladies, which they many years conducted,
she co-operated with them  in establishing and
teaching Sunday-schools in various parishes.
She persevered in all that she attempted, notwithstanding feeble health, and many attacks of dangerous disease. Misconstruction and calumny were
sometimes her portion. But she rose above them,
and kept on her way rejoicing. The friendship of
the good and virtuous was her shield, in all the
attacks of enmity.
In 1802 she erected a beautiful thatched. cottage,
in an elevated and picturesque situation, to which
she gave the name of Barley Wood. There she retired with her sisters, and the grounds were arranged
and ornamented by their united taste. She was
herself exceedingly fond of cultivating the beauties
of nature; and a cabinet-table, from whence issued
many a sheet for the edification of mankind, was
inlaid with small diamond shaped pieces of wood,
f'om trees which her own hand had planted.
In this hallowed retreat, her three elder sisters
paid the debt of nature, according to the order of
their birth. Each had attained the age of seventyfive years. In the autumn of 1819, the youngest
was taken, and the solitary survivor bore these bereavements with that faith which looks beyond the
world, for a re-union with the beloved. The affection of this family of sisters, had been ardent and
without a cloud. The supports of piety were necessary to console the one who was left, to finish her
journey alone.
In 1828 she removed to Clifton. Though moreTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
than fourscore years old, she still continued to meet
the claims of her correspondents, though she desisted from the composition of large volumes. She
excelled in the epistolary style, and in speaking. of
it, says, " What I wish for in a letter, is the picture
of my friend's mind, and the common sense of his
life. I want to know what he is saying and doing;
to have himn show me the inside of his heart without
disguise. I have this feeling when I write letters.
If I seek wisdom and lofty sentiment, I can find
them in books."
The last letter which she wrote was in her eightyeighth year. To the close of her long life her eye
was not dim. She could easily read the smallest
print without spectacles.  Her hearing was but
slightly impaired, and her features were neither
wrinkled nor uncomely. No impatient expression
was heard to escape her lips, even in moments of
the deepest suffering, and her beneficence and charitable feelings increased to the last.
As she approached the verge of life, her vigour
of mind yielded to declining health; but the fervour of her religious trust gained new strength.
Almost every thought was prayer. In the energy
of her expiring petitions, her friends, and those
who ministered around her bed, were earnestly
commended to the care of the Almighty.
She was continually blessing those around her, as
death approached. "May we meet in an eternal, a
glorious world."  A friend mentioned her good
deeds,- -her labours of benevolence. " Talk not so
vainly," she replied.' I utterly cast them from me.

I fall low at the foot of the cross." So full of humility was one, who had been the instrument of so
great good in her day and generation.
The night before her death, there was an unusual
brightness in her countenance. Striving to rise a
little from her pillow, she stretched out her arms,
and uttered the name of her favourite sister, the
last who had died, and exclaimed, in a clear voice,
"joy!" as if she indeed welcomed her. Then her
pulse grew fainter, and she lay for hours, as if in
the gentle breathing of infant sleep, broken occasionally by a sigh or groan. It was early in the afternoon of September 7th, 1833, that she ceased to
breathe.
In reading the works of this illustrious lady, we
are surprised both at their variety of subject and
compass of thought. With equal ease, she marked
out the map of virtue for a princess, or held the
lamp of truth to the miserable colliers, amid the
darkness of the mines. She could touch the tenderest chords of the heart in her poem on " Sensibility,"
or set forth the rudiments of a peasant's faith, in the
ballad of " Dan and Jane."
She could descend to the simplest alphabet of morality, in her tales of " the Postilion," the " Poacher," and the " Orange-Girl;" or soar to the highest
regions of sublimity, to portray the lineaments of
St. Paul, that " very chiefest of the apostles." A
mind, fitted like hers to range through the regions
of fancy, and catch the richness of classic imagery,

self to the petty and painful details of human wretchedness and vide.
Though the writings of Mrs. Hannah More display
such diversity, both in plan and style, they always
clearly keep in view the improvenlent and benlefit
of mankind. She never makes Vice beautiful, that
it may captivate the unguarded heart; or forms associations of thought, which make work for repentance.
Some of her best works, have been devoted to the
good of her own sex. They have discouraged trifling pursuits and frivolous, pleasures, and warned
them of the power which they might exercise to
elevate and purify society, without departing from
the sphere which Heaven had enjoined.
The effect, as well as the tendency of her writings,
has been salutary. It has been acknowledged by
politicians, that her native country has profited by
their spirit of patriotism, and masculine force of argument, which fearlessly admonishing the highest
ranks of their obligations, and inciting indigence to
its duty, laboured to rectify public opinion, to remove prejudices against just government, and to
show, that the safety of a nation is in the early and
pious nurture of all its children.
The diffusion of her works has kept pace with
their value. It may truly be said of them, that
" their speech has gone forth to the end of the
world." Besides their wide circulation, wherever
her native tongue is spoken, some of them have
been translated into' the languages of France, of
Germany, of Greece, and of Ceylon.

DIRS. BMARTHA LAUIRENS RAiIUA.A
MARTHA L,AURENS RAMSAY was borin at Charleston,
(South Carolina,) November 3, 1759. Herfather, Colonel hIenry Laurens, was conspicuous as a man of talents) and a statesman. Their ancestors were French
protestants, or Huguenots, who took refuge in this
country, " for righteousness sake," during the persecutions in the reign of Louis Fourteenth.
Her love of knowledge was very early developed.
At the age of three years, she could read any English book without difficulty. She soon added geography and arithmetic, a grammatical knowledge
of the French language, composition, and mathematics.
She was assiduous in abridging and transcribing
the authors that she read, and by her diligence in
impressing the substance of their remarks, and
sometimes their words, laid the foundation for that
wonderful memory by which she was distinguished through life. Feminine accomplishments,
and the ornamental parts of education, she was successful in acquiring. Indeed, whatever study was
recommended to her, she pursued with such docility
and fixed attention, as enabled her to excel.
At the age of eleven, her excellent mother died,
and she, with her only sister, was placed under the
care of a tender and pious aunt. Her father went
to Europe, to superintend the education of his sons,
and for the long period of eleven years, she had no
intercourse with him, except by the pen.

This separation from a beloved father, with the
afflicting loss of her mother, had the effect to draw
her nearer to her heavenly parent. Her religious
impressions became distinctly visible, and her conduct was evidently guided by hopes that are not ol
this world.
Among her devotional papers, one was found, after her decease, written when she was fourteen
years old, where, in a strain of fervent and eloquent
piety, which would do honour to the most experienced Christian, she dedicates herself to the service
of the Almighty. It was the language of a heart,
surrounded by the gayeties of youth, and the allurements of wealth, devoting itself to him, who has
promised, that those " who seek early, shall find."
She accompanied her uncle and aunt to England,
and there, at the age of sixteen, made a public profession of her Christian faith. In this act, she always rejoiced, as giving strength to the confidence
which, from still earlier years, she had placed in her
heavenly protector. She now sought the society of
the wise and pious, and in a letter to a friend, says,
" my highest ambition is, to have my will, in all
things, subject to the Divine will."
The war bet wreen England and her native country soon commenced, and her father was called
home, and appointed to an important station in that
arduous struggle. It was one of her most painful
trials, to hear him censured as an ambitious, unprincipled man, and a fomenter of discord between
Great Britain and the colonies. But armed with
the meekness which cometh from above, she repliedTHIE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
not to these revilings, but poured out her sorrows
in secret prayer.
WVhile her father filled the office of President of
Congress, foreseeing that peril must long overshadow the land, he wrote his daughter to prepare for
a reverse, and even, if it were necessary, to obtain
a subsistence by her own labour. ( If instead of affluence," said he, "to which you have still a just
claim, servitude should be your portion, meet it with
an honest and pious heart, like one who has been
neither affectedly, nor fashionably religious."
In 1778, she passed with her uncle, aunt, and sister, to France. Their native country was now the
seat of war. To obtain remittances, became more
and more difficult. But the evils of poverty in a
foreign land, to those who had been always accustomed to the indulgences of wealth, were borne
without repining, and mutual affection sweetened
their frugal repast.
The health of her uncle became so feeble, that he
resigned all hope of recovery. Her father, sent to
England on business for his country, was thrown a
prisoner into the Tower, on a charge of high treason, and in danger of his life. Charleston was in
the hands of the enemy; Carolina overrun by their
armies; and, as the climax of her sorrows, news
came, that her beloved brother, John Laurens, had
fallen in battle.
Now, the value of that religion, which she had
chosen in childhood, was fully revealed. She was
enabled to endure, without murmuring, and even
cheerfully. In her journal, she writes, "My soul,
163THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
be of good courage. Wait on the Lord. He shalh
strengthen thee.  Thou shalt not have one more
trial than is necessary. The cross shall never be
heavier than thou canst bear."
Ere long, hope began to dawn upon the destinies
of her native land. Her father was released from
prison, and entrusted with public negotiations to the
court of France. She was summoned to join him
in Paris, and who can tell the rapture with which,
for the first time for almost twelve years, she received his paternal embrace.
The change was great, from the privations of po
verty, the toil of the nurse's chamber, and the soli
tude of a remote country village, to the head of the table of a minister-plenipotentiary, in the gayest metropolis of the gayest clime of Europe. This, to many
young ladies, would have been dangerous.; But the
religion which had supported her in adversity, was
her protection in prosperity.
Amid the flatteries that surrounded her, the bible
was her daily study. In her journal, she thus writes,
when about to join a splendid and fashionable party.'" Enable me so to demean myself, that all may
take knowledge of me, that I have been with Jesus.
Let the law of kindness dwell upon my tongue, and
teach me to discountenance sin, in the spirit of humility."
Her father having been long prevented by the obstructions of war, from making her his usual remittances, now gave her at one time, the sum of five
hundred guineas. Long compelled to observe the
most rigid economy in her wardrobe, did she not
164THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
now indulge in the purchase of those expensive articles which she saw continually worn by people
with whom she associated?
She applied only a small part to her own use, and
that for articles of obvious necessity. W.Vith the remainder, she bought one hundred French testaments, and distributed to the poor, established a
school in the village where she had resided, engaged
a master, and constituted a fund for the permanent
support of the institution.
The uncle, who had so kindly been her protector, during her separat{n from the paternal
roof, died in France, of the disease which had for
years marked his life with suffering. Being childless, it was his intention to leave the principal part
of his fortune to the favourite niece, whose cheerful services in his sick chamber, during their restricted circumstances, had been so constant and
invaluable.
She was apprised of this design, and with her
usual disinterestedness, expressed all urgent desire,
that her sister and brothers might share in his bounty.
The will was altered to gratify her wishes, but the
uncle also indulged himself, by leaving her a bequest
of five hundred pounds sterling, expressly stating it
to be " an acknowledgment for her many services
to him, and to his family, and for her good and gentle conduct at all times."
Her gratitude, on her return to her native country, was unbounded, to find it, after her ten years
exile, in peace, freedom, and maintaining a rank
among the nations of the earth. Not long after, she
165166         THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
became the wife of Dr. David Ramsay, a man highly respected for his eminence in science and literature, and capable of appreciating the worth of the
companion whom he had chosen.
Her conduct in the station of a wife, the mistress of a household, and the mother of children,
shone forth as an example to all. She lightened
the burden of her husband's cares, and assisted
him, as far as possible, in his literary and professional labours.  In times of general sickness,
she sought out, in various books, cases of peculiar importance, and Selated to him, or presented,
in one view, the opinions of standard medical authors.
In the first sixteen years after her marriage, she
became the mother of eleven children. In their
care and education she was indefatigable. In every
season of sickness and pain, she was their most
watchful, tender nurse. She sought to procure
for each a good constitution, and a well-regulated
mind.
She taught them industry, and as they gained
vigour, inured them to fatigue and occasional hardship. She required them to restrain their tempers;
to subject their desires to the control of reason and
religion; to practise self-denial; to bear disappointment; to resist the importunity of present pleasure
or pain, for the sake of what wisdom and experience pronounced necessary to be done, or to be
suffered.
Their duty to God, she impressed on them while
their minds were tender.  That they might readTHE GIRL S READING-BOOK.
the Bible with pleasure, she connected with it, when
they were quite young; a set of prints; and, as they
advanced in understanding, added such works as
unite uninspired to sacred history, and the Old to
the New Testament.
Thus, to the minds of her children, the Bible,
though written at widely remote periods, was presented as an uniform, harmonious system of divine
truth. The voice of a revered mother was continually heard, enjoining upon them to read daily a
portion from its blessed pages, with prayer, and to
view it as the rule of their duty, the source of their
eternal hope.
She constantly assisted their progress in useful
knowledge, and took the whole superintendence of
their education. For the use of her first children
she compiled a grammar of the English language,
not finding those of Lowth and Ash, which were
then the only ones she could obtain, subject to the
comprehension of unfolding intellects.
She prepared questions for them in ancient and
modern history, which they were expected to answer from their general knowledge, and in their
own language. From her accurate acquaintance
with French, she excelled in it as a teacher; and for
their sakes she studied the Greek and Latin classics
so as to become a profitable instructor in those languages.
With the same ardour to advance the education
of her children, she studied botany, and refreshed
her knowledge of natural and civil history, biography, astronomy, chronology, philosophy, and
167168

an extensive course of voyages and travels. She
gave her instructions with regularity, and thus conducted her daughters at home through the studies
and accomplishments taught at boarding-schools,
and her sons through a course of training, which
fitted them to enter college.
She endeavoured to render the sabbath, a season
both profitable and pleasant to all the young around
her. A part of the intervals of divine worship was
spent in reading religious books with her children
and servants, and in examining them respecting the
sermons, of which she frequently wrote an abridgment from memory. She also read the New Testament in Greek with her sons, and in French with
her daughters.
She was exceedingly strict in her improvement
of time. By rising early, she secured the best
part of the day for devotion, for the necessary duties of a housekeeper, and for the instruction of
her children. A portion of each day was devoted
to a course of reading, and also to the practice of
needleworlk, in which useful art she rendered her
daughters expert, and insisted, eveii amidst the
heat of a Carolina summer, on their systematic industry.
The amount of her writing was wonderful. Besides her diary, she had an extensive correspondence. She excelled in the epistolary style. Some
of her letters to her eldest son, while absent at college, are appended to her memoir. She copied for
her husband the whole of his " History of the Aimer
rican Revolution," "Life of Washington," "c RoTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK,
view of the Progress of Medicine in the Eighteentlh
Century," and all the earlier part of his " Universal
History.s"
She wrote rapidly, and also a- very legible and
beautiful hand. It was a rule with her, that whatever was done, should be done well. She had been
in the habit of transcribing original papers for her
father, asy well as her husband, and he pronounced
her the best clerk he had ever employed; though, in
his extensive public business, he had many of superior excellence.
Her memory was remarkably retentive, and she
strengthened it by continual exercise. Though she
read many books, their substance remnained with
her. Of some, she was able to repeat nearly the
whole. Her acquaintance with the Scriptures was
so intimate, that she could readily quote, or turn
to any passage bearing upon the subject of conversation.
For her astonishing amount of industrious performance, and her uniform excellence in every relative duty, she derived strength from her spirit of
piety. She lived a life of prayer. In every important transaction, in the midst of her daily cares, she
poured her anxieties into the ear of her heavenly
Father, solicited his direction, and brought the tribute of her grateful praise.
In her last sickness, she earnestly admonished
all around her to seek God by prayer, and to make
him their confidence. She asked her husband and
children, about four o'clock in the afternoon of June

I once heard a little girl say, " I have just learned
that Jupiter has four moons. Now I will remember
it by joining it with other things that have in them
the number four. There are four seasons, four
middle states, four asteroids, or little planets, and
the other thing of four, shall be the moons of Jupiter." The child had discovered the principle of
numerical association, which is a great help to
memory.
" Romulus slew his brother Remus," said a little
boy, " and Cain slew his brother Abel. The firstborn of Eden and the first king of Rome, were fratricides. One will make me remember the other."
Here was resemblance or similitude in fact, assisting
the memory. Contrasted images may also be so
associated, as to adhere strongly to recollection.

THE LADY BUG AND THE ANT.
THE lady-bug sat in the rose's heart,
And smil'd with pride and scorn,
As she saw a plain-drest ant go by,
With a heavy grain of corn;
So she drew the curtains of damask round,
And adjusted her silken vest,
Making her glass of a drop of dew
That lay in the rose's breast.
Then she laugh'd so loud that the ant looked up
And seeing her haughty face,
Took no more notice, but travell'd on
At the same industrious pace.
But a sudden blast of autumn came,
And rudely swept the ground,
And down the rose with the lady-bug fell,
And scatter'd its leaves around.
Then the houseless lady was much amaz'd,
And knew not where to go,
For hoarse November's early blast
Had brought both rain and snow.
Her wings were chill, and her feet were cold,
And she wish'd for the ant's warm cell,
And what she did when the winter came,
I'm sure I cannot tell.

With her little ones by her side,

Till all the flowers were cover'd, and the trees
Hid their tall heads, and where the houses stood,
And people dwelt, a fearful deluge roll'd;
Because the world was wicked, and refuis'd
To heed the words of God.
But one good man,
Who long had warn'd the wicked to repent,
Obey, and live, taught by the voice of lheaven,
Had built an ark; and thither, with his wife
And children, turn'd for safety. Two and two
Of birds and beasts, and creeping things, he took,
With food for all; and when the tempest roar'd,
And the great fountains of the sky pour'd out
A ceaseless flood, till all beside were drown'd,
They in their, quiet vessel dwelt secure.
And so the mighty waters bare them up,
And o'er the bosom of the deep they sail'd
For many days. But then a gentle dove'Scap'd from the casement of the ark, and spread
Her lonely pinion o'er the boundless wave.
All, all was desolation. Chirping nest,

Save wide, deep waters, and dark, frowning skies,
Nor found her weary foot a place of rest.

With drooping wing the peaceful ark she sought.

And to her mate restor'd, who, with sad moan,
Had wondered at her absence.

Went forth to build her nest, and thousand birds
Awoke their songs of praise, while the tir'd ark

Repos'd, and Noah, with glad spirit, rear'd

Or sometimes mix'd with tears, for thou dost know

And thy breath quicken it, nor should I blush
To lift my face to thee, to speak thy name,
And call thee Father, had not sin so stain'd,

And as a parent guides and guards a child
Oft wandering, yet belov'd, so guide thou me

ORDER.
"Mother, will you please to tell me if you have
seen my thimble?"-" Martha, I thought you had a
place foryour thimble."-" So I have, dear mother,
but it does not happen to be in the place."
To have a place for things, and not keep them in
it, is like having wise laws, and paying no regard to
them. A nation will not be the better for its laws,
unless it enforces them; nor a child for being told its
duty, unless it trys to obey.
Martha's fault, was a want of order. Her working-materials were scattered about the house. She
was obliged to spend much time in searching for
them. When the school-bell rang, some of her
books could not be found. Perhaps, her bonnet, or
shawl, or gloves, were mislaid.
She felt ashamed to be so often inquiring for what
she ought to have kept in their own place. So, she
sometimes went without necessary articles, and was
unprepared at school, or looked slovenly in the
street.
She was a little girl of a good disposition. But
this fault occasioned her to be much blamed. And
instead of being cheerful with a consciousness of
right conduct, she was often disgraced and unhappy.
When she grew up, she carried these careless
habits into her housekeeping. Though she had a
kind heart, there were disorder and discomfort in her
family. Nothing was in its right place. Her work
was done by the hardest, for want of the proper
materials.

Nor think how future years
May bring stern Sorrow's speechless pang,
Or Disappointment's tears.
Unceasing toil, unpitied care,
Cold treachery's serpent-moanIlls that the tender heart must bear
Unanswering and alone.
But as the frail and fragrant flower,
Crush'd by the sweeping blast,

So woman's deep, enduring love,
Which nothing can appal,

C3HILD AT THE MIOTHER'S GRAVE.
MY mother's grave!'Tis there beneath the trees.
I love to go alone, and sit, and think,
Upon that grassy mound. My cradle hours
Come back again so sweetly, when I woke
And lifted up my head, to kiss the cheek
That bowed to meet me.
And I seem to feel
Once more the hand that smooth'd my clustering
curls,
And led me to the garden, pointing out
Each fragrant flower and bud, or drawing back
My foot, lest I should careless crush the worm
That crawl'd beside one.
And that gentle tone,
Teaching to pat the house-dog, and be kind
To the poor cat, and spare the little flies
Upon the window, and divide my bread
With those that hunger'd, and bow meekly down
To the gray-headed man, and look with love
On all whom God had made.
And then her hymn
At early evening, when I went to rest,
And folded closely to her bosom, sat
Joining my cheek to her's, and pouring out?My broken music, with her tuneful strain:191192         THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
Comes it not back again that holy hymn,
Even now upon my ear?
But when I go
To my lone bed, and find no mother there,
And weeping kneel to say the prayer she taught,
Or when I read the Bible that she lov'd,
Or to her vacant seat at church draw near,
And think of her, a voice is in my heart,
Bidding me early seek my God, and love
My blessed Saviour.Sure that voice is her's,I know it is, because these were the words
She us'd to speak so tenderly, with tears,
At the still twilight-hour, or when we walk'd
Forth in the Spring amid rejoicing birds,
Or whispering talked beside the winter fire.
-Mother I'll keep these precepts in my heart,
And do thy bidding.
Then, when God shall say,
My days are finish'd, will he give me leave
To come to thee? And can I find thy home,
And see thee with thy glorious garments on,
And kneel at the Redeemer's feet, and beg
That where the mother is, the child may dwell?THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.

She was always in a hurry. This is an evil which
comes upon those, who have not the spirit of order.
Her countenance, which used to be pleasant, soon
wore a troubled and bewildered expression. Wrinkles came over her forehead, before it was time to
be old.
Though she was naturally amiable, this sad fault
spoiled her temper. Her children imitated her, and
kept none of their things in the right place. One
would be heard complaining that a hat or cloak
could not be found, and another bewailing a lost
doll, or broken play-things.
The mother fretted loudly at her little ones, for
faults that grew out of her own want of order. She
had a cousin, whose name was Mary. They lived
near each other, and were of the same age. When
they were* young, they often played together, and
sat on the same bench at school.
Mary took good care of all that was entrusted
to her. When she had done sewing, her needle
was returned to the needle-case, and her thimble
and scissors to the work-basket. Her knitting was
neatly rolled, and replaced in its bag.
Her garments were folded, and laid in the drawers and trunks where they belonged. Her bonnet
was hung in the spot allotted to it, as soon as she
entered the house, and her school-books laid on that
part of the shelf, which she was permitted to call
her own.
At school, her pens and ink were in good order,
and she never blotted her paper, or her desk. She
had no need to borrow, and if it had been dark, she

SCHOLAR'S TRIBUTE TO AN INSTRUCTOR.
As when an eye, accustomed to survey
The changeful aspect of an April day,
Turns back regretful to the purple dawn,
Or morning's rose-tint on the dewy lawn;
So I, from life's delusions, vain and wild,
Retrace the scenes that charm'd me when a child.
Yet most I love those softly blending shades,
Where youth just glimmers, and where childhood
fades;
And'mid that cherish'd imagery I see,
Revered instructor, many a trace of thee,
Thy footsteps on the grass, all fresh with dew,
Thy gentle hands where early snow-drops grew.
Too oft had critic rigourharshly doom'd
My buds of promise, withering ere they bloom'd,
Or cold neglect appall'd with freezing eye
A lonely mlind, that shrank, it knew not why;
But thou didst stoop to shield that timid mind,
Wise as a teacher, as a parent kind,
With studious care, its wayward course to lead,
And nurse the music of the whispering reed.
A plant of feeble stemn, thou would'st not mock,
Rude as the flowers that clothe the Alpine rock,
Nor blight its tendrils with a causeless pang,
Nor scorn it, though from lowly bed it sprang;
201THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
But watch'd its rooting with a florist's care,
Rais'd its wan blossoms to a genial air,
And o'er its narrow leaves, and bending head,
Pure dews of knowledge and of virtue shed.
Even now of stature frail, and low degree,
More weak and worthless than it ought to be,
It turns to him its shrinking buds that blest,
And pours fresh fragrance from a grateful breast.
Yet more than what I speak, to thee I owe,
And richer gifts than strains so weak can show;
Thy warning voice allur'd my listening youth
To seek the path of piety and truth,
And heaven's first hopes, as vernal sunbeams roll,
Dawn'd from thy prayers upon, my waiting soul.
Oh, ever free from pain, and doubt, and strife,
Flow on the current of thy tranquil life,
Pure as the streams that o'er white pebbles glide,
And mix reproachless with a mightier tide,
Bright as the star, whose trembling lamp on high
Precedes the morn, and gilds the evening sky,
Tili time's brief tide the eternal sea shall stay,
And earth's dim lights at glory's sun decay.

RE(COLLECTIONS OF AN ACED PASTOR.
I DO remember him. His saintly voice,
So duly lifted in the house of God,
Comes with the far-off wing of infant years,
Like solemn music.
Often have we hush'd
The shrillest echo of our holiday,
Turning our mirth to reverence as he past,
And eager to record one favouring smile,
Or word paternal.
/        ~    At the bed of death
I do remember him; when one who bore
For me a tender love, did feel that pang
Which makes the features rigid, and the eye
Like a fixed glassy orb. Her head was white
WTith many winters; but her furrow'd brow
To me was beautiful; for she had cheer'd
My lonely childhood, with a changeless stream
Of pure benevolence.
His earnest tone
Girding her from the armoury of Gcod,
To foil the terrors of that shadowy vale
Through which she walk'd, doth linger round me
still;
And by that gush of bitter tears, when grief
First came into my bosom; by that thrill
Of agony, which from the open'd grave
Rose wildly forth-I do remember him,
The comforter and friend.

Keen has been the scythe of fate.

Sent forth their roots to reach the stream,
Their blossomrs toward the rising beam,

And sank at eve, in withering death.

To trouble this deep solitude;
But should the giddy footstep tread

Nor pluck the tender leaves that wave
In sweetness o'er this sainted grave.
White were the locks that thinly shed
Their sniows around her honour'd head.
And furrows not to be effac'd,
Had age amid her features trac'd,
Before my earliest strength I tried
In infant gambols by her side;
But yet no grace or beauty rare
Were ever to my eye so fair.
Seven times the sun, with swift career,
Has mark'd the circle of the year,
Since first she press'd her lowly bier;
And seven times, sorrowing, have I come
Alone and wandering through the gloom,
To pour my lays upon her tomb:
And I have mourn'd, to see her bed
With brambles and with thorns o'erspread.
Ah, surely, round her place of rest
I should not let the coarse weed twine,
Who so the couch of pain hath blest,
The path of penury freely drest,
And scatter'd such perfumes on mine:
It is not meet, that she should be
Forgotten or unblest by me.

could have laid her hand upon all her things,-for
she remembered their places, and knew that they
were there.
She had fewer things than her cousin Martha, because her parents were not so rich. But she had
more that were ready'for use. Her clothes lasted
longer, and looked more neatly. For she had been
taught to mend them, the moment that they needed
it, and to fold each garment when she took it off at
night.
When she had a house of her own, every article
in it had a place, and all who used it, were required
to put it there. One of her first rules to her children when very young--was, "a place for every
thing; and every thing in its place." And she
obliged them to obey this rule. So her family were
in order, and its daily labour went on like clockwork.
Her countenance was pleasant and peaceful, like
one who does right. And though she was not as
handsome as Martha, it was more agreeable to look
at her, because she was never in a hurry.
Her quietness of mind seemed to proceed from a
sense of justice, or of doing her duty even to inanimate things: for we owe a duty to every article in
our possession, and to every utensil with which we
work; the duty of keeping them in order, and a good
condition.

To whom the gift of life did seem a toil
It shrank to bear.-And I remember well,

When it would seem as if the fainting breath
Must leave her bosom, and her fair blue eye
Sank'neath its lids, like some crushed violet.
Six winters came, and now that self-same babe
Wins with her needle the appointed length
Of her light task, and learns with patient zeal
The daily lesson, tracing on her map
All climnes and regions of the peopled earth.
With tiny hand, she guides the writer's quill,
Graving those lines through which the soul doth
speak,
And pours in timid tones her hymn at eve.
She, from the pictur'd page, doth scan the tribes
That revel in the air, or cleave the flood,
Or roam the wild, delighting much to know
Their various natures, and their habits all,
From the huge elephant, to the small fly
That liveth but a day, yet in that day
Is happy, and outspreads a shining wing,
Exulting in the mighty Maker's care.

And snare the pigeon hasting to its nest

At early morning, seated on his knee,
Her hoary grandsire from the Book of God,
Who meekly happy in his fourscore years,
Heeds not the dimness gathering o'er his sight,
But with a saintly kindness bows him down
To drink from her young lip the lore he loves.

To burst its sheath, hath come so quickly forth,

May rise to praise him with an angel's song.

she said in her stronog language of gesture, that "her heart had so

From  countless harps it flows,
Throughout this bright celestial sphere
Nor pause nor discord knows.

By love divine,
And what through life I pined to hear,

And the full, deep response of David's sacred lyre

LOUISA.
SHE was my idol. Night and day, to scan
The fine expansion of her form, and mark
The unfolding mind, like vernal rose-bud, start
To sudden beauty, was my chief delight.
To find her fairy footsteps following mine,
Her hand upon my garments, or her lip
Long seal'd to mine, and in the watch of night
The quiet breath of innocence to feel
Soft on my cheek, was such a full content
Of happiness, as none but mothers know.
Her voice was like some tiny harp, that yields
To the slight-finger'd breeze, and as it held
Gay converse with her doll, or gently sooth'd
The moaning kitten, or with patient care
Conn'd o'er the alphabet-but most of all,
Its tender cadence in her evening prayer,
Thrill'd on the ear like some ethereal tone
I-eard in sweet dreams.
But now alone I sit,
Musing of her, and dew with mournful tears
Her little robes, that once with curious pride
I wrought, as though there were a need to deck
A form that God had made so beautifiul.
Sometimes I start, fancying her empty crib
Gives forth a restless sound, and softly say,
"Hush, hush, Louisa, dearest!'--then I weep.

It was called the picture of the sisters of Bethany.
You will remember that their names were the same
as those of the two cousins, Martha and Mary. One,
with a complaining, care-worn face, seemed inldeed
"cumbered with much serving;" the other wore
that sweet, peaceful smile, which said plainer than
words, that she had chosen the " good part."
And in visiting many families, both in the city

takes hold of her work, and makes the members of
her household comfortable.220         THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.

Who o'er my pillow hung,

To lay it by her side;

Like that with which a mother mourns,

That rends and wrecks the tossing soul,
But their cold, blue eyes were dry.
Pale faces gazed upon her,
As the wild winds cauLght her moan,But she was an Indian mother,So, she wept those tears alone.
Long, o'er that wasting idol,

Though every dreary dawn reveal'd
Some ravage Death had made:
Till the fleshless sinews started,
And hope no opiate gave,

An echo from the grave.
She was a gentle creature,
Of raven eye and tress,
And dovelike were the tones that breath;d

The warm blood strongly sent
To revel in her olive cheek,
So richly eloquent.
I said Consumption smote her,
And the healer's art was vain;
But she was an Indian maiden,
So none deplor'd her pain;None, save that widow'd mother,
Who now, by her open tomb,
Is writhing like the smitten wretch
Whom judgment marks for doom.
Alas! that lowly cabin,
That couch beside the wall,
That seat beneath the mantling vine,

Must ne'er return again?

SE., how the year in changeful garb appears,First, in its cloudy mantle, moist with showers,
Most like a timid child,'mid smiles and tears;
Next, as a blooming maiden crowned with flowers;
Then like a matron lulling infant hours
To gentle sleep, with soft, melodious chime;
Then weak and hoary, with enfeebled powers,,
And bent beneath the wintry hand of time;
And last, with magic strange, renews her early

Whether with songs of vernal birds they rove,
Or freshly deck the hillock's grassy head,
Or in the reaper's dance rejoicing move,
Or strew with falling leaves the solemn grove;
Still to the thoughtful eye their change is fair,
And still they claim the grateful lay of love
From the meek soul, that feels its Maker's care,
Beholds him in his -works, and joys to praise him

THE CH[ILDR,EN'S FIRST W'ALK TOGETHER.
They passed together, out of their father's gate, a
little girl and boy. Their quick steps were short
and unequal, as if they had trodden only on the
nursery-carpet, or the smooth gravel walk of the
garden.
They took their way along the village street. It
was bordered with fresh grass. They were pleased
that it swelled into little mounds and again descended,-and they thought every hillock was a mountain.
They admired the daisies, and king-cups,--and
when a robin flew by, they said,-" Bird, are these
your flowers?-may we pick some of them?" Then
they discovered a small brook, that went gurgling
along, and stood wondering upon its pleasant banks.
The sister's arm was over the neck of her brother.
She was the eldest one. And tenderly she watched
over him. If the swift wheel rushed by, or the
wide-horn'd ox seemed to press too near, or the dog
with open mouth paused as if regarding him, the
same motherly care sat upon her sweet brow, as
will hereafter take root there, when she rocks the
cradle of her own babe.
The bold, beautiful boy was glad to be free. He
often looked back, till he saw that neither nurse or
servant followed. Then he tossed his white arms
high over his head, and shouted out his first joy of
liberty.
But there was an eye that followed them. It
never lost sight of them a moment, until they seem
ed but as specks, far away, among the green trees

The little baskets whence they hope to dine,

While through the western wild he sped,

Just then, within the thicket rude,

On the rough floor their simple bed,
Inl haste and weariness, they spread,
And laid them down to rest.

WHEELS o'er the pavement roll'd, and a slight forn
Just in the bud of blushing womanhood
Reached the paternal threshold. Wrathful night
Muffled the timid stars, and rain-drops hung
On that fair creature's rich and glossy curls.

Dry'd those damp tresses, and with warm caress
Sustain'd the weary spirit. No, that hand

Breathing his woes away.

Toil'd for the fruits of knowledge, treasuring still

And the pure music of his welcome home,

That fell on those fresh hopes, when all in vain
The passive hand was grasp'd, and the wide halls
Re-echoed "father! father!"
Through the shades
Of that long silent night, she sleepless bent,
Bathing with tireless hand the unmoved brow,
And the death-pillow smoothing. When fair morn

And Hope's fond vision faded as the day
Rode on in glory.

And found that pale and beautiful watcher there,
Still unreposing. Restless on his couch
Toss'd the sick man. Cold Lethargy had steep'd
Its last dead poppy in his heart's red stream,
And agony was stirring Nature up
To struggle with her foe.

And curious villagers, intent to scan

Even o'er the coffin and the warning shroud
Revolving selfish schemes.
But one was there,

Like that pale piece of clay. Calmly she stood
Asmnarble statue. Not one trickling tear,
Or quivering of the eye-lid, told she liv'd,
Or tasted sorrow. The old house-dog came,THIE GIRLS READING-BOOK.

Was a deep riddle to the lawless thought
Of whispering gossips. Of her sire they spakce,

Nor spot, nor stain, nor wrinkle bear,
And I with hovering wing elate,

when flesh and heart fail, and when the tottering
feet enter the dark valley of the shadow of death?
"Or art thou to be cut down in thy blossom, in the
faint green of thine unfolding leaves? Shall thy
mother lay thee in thy last cold bed, and come nightly to weep there? Shall the hands that cherished
thee in the cradle, plant a young white rose on thy
turf pillow, an emblem of thy simple innocence?
Who can tell?"
The mother looked upward and said, " Thou, God,
knowest." And when she had prayed, there came a
trusting smile over her countenance, which seemed
to say that her dear ones were his, and that he loved
them, and would do no wrong to them, or to her.
Then she heard the sweet voices of her children
returning, like the chirping of young birds, who have
newly ventured from their nest. And she went forth
to welcome them, and kissed their bright, ruddy
cheeks, rejoicing in them, and in Him who gave
them.

THE BOY AND HIS GARDEIN.
A child held in his' hand a slight, leafless shoot,
It was like a supple, green wand. Yet it had been
newly cut from the parent tree, and life was secretly
stirring in its little heart.
He sought out a sheltered spot in the piece of
ground that he called his own. He planted it there
in the moist earth. He came often to visit it, and
when the rains of summer were withheld, he watered
it at the cool hour of sunset.
The sap, which is the blood of plants, began to
circulate through its tender vessels. A tiny root,
like a thread, crept downwards. Soon, around the
head, there burst forth a garland of pale green
leaves.
Seasons passed over it, and it became a small tree.
As fast as its branches came forth, they drooped
downwards to the earth. The cheering sun smiled
on them,-the happy birds sang to them: but they
drooped still.
" Tree, why art thou always sad and drooping?Am I not kind unto thee? Do not the showers visit
thee, and sink deep to refresh thy root? Hast thou
a sorrow at thy heart?" But it answered not. And
as it grew on, it drooped lower and lower. For itwas a weeping willow.
The boy cast a seed into his soft garden mould.
When the time of flowers came, a strong budding
stalk stood there, with coarse, serrated leaves. SoonTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
there came forth a full, red poppy, glorying in its
gaudy dress.
At its feet grew a purple violet, which no hand
had planted or cherished. It lived lovingly with the
wild mosses, and the frail flowers of the grass, not
counting itself more excellent than they.
"Large poppy, why dost thou spread out thy
scarlet robe so widely, and drink up the sunbeams
from my lonely violet?" But the flaunting flower
replied not to him who planted it.
It unfolded its rich silk mantle still more broadly,
as though it would fain have stifled its humbler
neighbour. Yet nothing hindered the fragrance of
the meek violet, nursing its infant buds.
The little child was troubled, and at the hour of
sleep he told his mother of the tree that continually
wept, and of the plant that overshadowed its neighbour. She took him on her knee, and spoke so tenderly in his ear, that he remembered her words
when he became a man.
" There are some who, like thy willow, are weepers
all their lives long, though they dwell in pleasant
places, and the fair skies shine upon them. And
there are others, who, like the poppy that thou didst
reprove, are haughty in heart, and despise the humble, whom God regardeth.
"Be thou not like them, my gentle child. But
keep rather in thy heart the sweet spirit of the lowly violet, that thou mayest come at last to that blessed place which pride cannot enter, and where weeping is never known."

T1HE SUD1IMER SUN.
ThE eastern sky is rich with prevailing light.
What a beautiful saffron colour marks the horizon.
Now, it spreads more widely around. In one spot
there is peculiar brightness. A few rays shoot up,
as heralds of some distinguished guest. Then the
glorious sun appears, the eye of the world.
It is not to our earth alone that he dispenses light
and heat. Other planets rejoice in his brightness.
Moving around these are still smaller bodies, like
children with their parents. The sun has a large
and beautiful family. Is he not like a patriarch with
his eleven children, and his eighteen grandchildren?
He sits on the chief seat among them, cheering
them with his gifts. Do you know some bountiful
person making the hearts of others glad? Have
you a benevolent friend whose warm smile makes
you happy? They may be compared to the sun
"rejoicing in the east." Let them also remind you
of Him who made the sun, in " whom the outgoings
of the morning and of the evening rejoice?"
Hark, the birds sing. Some soar high with a
graceftul movement, into the clear, blue sky. The
flowers, sparkling with dew, lift their bright eyes to
their Benefactor. A fresh and grateful odour goes
up from the green forests. Every plant and leaf
seems to partake of a new joy.
There was a statue in ancient Egypt called the
statue of Memnon, which was said at sunrise to utter

an articulate sound. So ought the most silent and
cold heart to speak forth praise for the gift of every
pleasant mornilg.
Turn to your protector in heaven, who has given
you the repose of sleep. Kneel and thank him for
his care. M3any through this day will suffer pain
and sickness. Ask him to keep you in health and
usefulness. Many will weep over dying friends.
Ask him to hold in life those whom you love.
Some, ere the setting of this sun, will fall into
temptation. Ask him to preserve you in the path
of duty and of peace. Some will be taken out of
the world. Should you be of that number, ask him
to make you fit to enter heaven. He alone is able
to do these things for you. His blessing is like the
sun to the plants of virtue in your soul.
Be sure to rise with the sun. Do not let him surprise you in bed. Pay him the respect to get up
and meet him. Let your morning.hours be industriously spent. Dr'. Franklin said, " if you lose an
hour in the morning, you may run all day and not
overtake it." How true it is! " 1-lours have wings,"
said another wise man.
See, it is noon. The sun has reached the meridian. The groups of children returning from school
feel the heat. The labouring ox is permlitted to rest
awhile, as well as his master. The horses in the
stage-coach pant, and are glad to draw near the taveri. The cows like to stand in the quiet stream.
How refreshing are the shady trees. What a comfort is the pure, cool water.
Now, the little Chinese child sleeps on the breast

THE EIDER-DUCIK AND THE BIRD OF
PARADISE.
THE Eider-Duck is a fine bird. It is brown or
uvhite, and sometimes of other colours. It has a
black crest on its head, like a little crown. If it
lives to be old, its bright plumage turns gray.
It is found in countries near the poles. It does
not fear the cold, for it is covered wvith a soft, warm
down. He who gave fur to the bear, and a coat of
wo,ol to the sheep, clothed this bird with a downy
robe, that it might resist the winter.
It is fbnd of its young, and takes kind care of them,
The mother-bird builds a good nest, and lines it with
the down from her own breast. She plucks it oft,
and willingly bears the pain, that her little ones may
be warm and sheltered.
The eider-down is much valued. It is an article
of commerce. It is used for the covering of beds,
and to stuff cloaks and hoods, and to trim other arti
cles of clothing.
People are so desirous to get it, that they sometimes tear in pieces the nest which the poor bird has
lined for her young. This they call the live downz,
and prefer it to what they pluck from the birds after
their death. They also climb high rocks, to obtain
their eggs for eating.
The eider-duck is found in great numbers, amid
the perpetual snow and ice of Greenland, Iceland,
and Norway. Sometimes they are seen in the neigh
bourhood of our great lakes, and in the northern
parts of the United States.
32THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
A father was once walking with his little son. He
carried a gun upon his shoulder. Suddenly he pointed it at something upon a rock above his head. It
was a large bird who seemed hard at work, spreading out her wings, and bowing down her head, and
leaping up.
"Dear father; what is she doing?" " Tearing the
down from her breast, to make a soft bed for her
little ones." " Does it not give her pain?" "Yes,
but she loves them better than herself."
The boy gazed earnestly at the eider-duck. "Father, how long is it since we moved into this new,
cold country?." "Two years, my son."
"I remember the first winter that we came here.
My mother took us children to see the only neighbour that we had. It was a long way to walk, and.
soon after we left to return home, it began to
snow.
" The feet of the youngest girl tottered with weakness. So,: my mother took her in her arms. She
toiled on with her through the storm, and against the
wind. She took the only shawl from her shoulders
and wrapped it around the child, pressing her close
to her bosom.
" Ah! how glad were we to see, at last, the lonely
light streaming fiom our own window. It seemed
like a star of heaven. When we got home, the little
one was warm, but our poor mother was cold and
faint a-nd sick.
"She had deprived herself of her own covering,
that the child might be sheltered. And she did not
33THE GIRL S READING-BOO,0
complain, because she loved the child. Was she not
a good mother?"
The father did, not answer. And when the son
looked up, he saw that there was a tear in his eye.
1" Is not the eider-duck a good mother? See, she
bares her own breast for her little ones. Dear father, let her live." So the father had compassion on
the mother-bird, and spared her that she might take
care of her young.
The Bird of Paradise differs from the eider-duck.
by living only in warm climates. It is never found
many degrees from the equator. Its plumage is exceedingly beautiful. The side feathers of the wing
float out to a great length, and are of various brilliant colours.
They principally inhabit New Guinea, and the
Spice Islands. They pass and repass in flocks of
thirty or forty, conducted by a leader. They are
very careful to consult the state of the wind, and
always move against it, in order to preserve their
voluminous train of feathers in good order.
Sometimes the wind suddenly changes. Then
their sweeping plumage becomes entangled, and the
pride of their glorious beauty is their overthrow.
They fall to the ground and are taken by the natives, or into the water and are lost.
They are all distinguished by their splendid attire. They differ from the eider-duck, as the fashionable lady does from the domestic and devoted
mother. It is only for ornament that they are prized
by the inhabitants of the east. The nobles of Per

sia, Surat, and the East Indies, are anxious to obtain
them towear upon their turbans.
There are twelve or fifteen different species.
The most elegant of these is called the Great Bird
of Paradise. It is of a cinnamon colour, with a
throat of golden yellow, and the body is small. It
measures two feet from the bill to the extremity of
its floating train.
The natives had a tradition that they dwelt in the
sky, and never touched the earth till their last hour.
Some travellers mention, that to prevent the detection of this error, they are so cruel as to cut off their
feet ere they sell them. It is this species of the
bird of paradise which has sometimes been called
"the footless fowl of Indian fable."THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
LESSONS IN THE FIELDS.
WHEN I was a child, I knew an old, gray haired
man. Years had brought him wisdom, and he was
kind as well as wise. So, I loved him, and rejoiced
when I saw him coming towards me, leaning upon
his staff.
Once, as he talked with me, he said, " I know a
way to be happy. I learned it in the fields." Then
I entreated him to teach it also to me. But he answered, " Go forth into the fields, among living
things, and learn it there for thyself."
I went forth, and looked attentively upon all that
moved around. But no voice spake, and no eye regarded me. So, I returned to the aged man, and
when he asked what I saw in the fields, I replied:
"I saw the brook flowing on among sweet flowers.
It seemed to be singing a merry song. I listened,
but there were no words to the music. The sparrow flew by me with down in her beak, wherewith
to line her nest, and the red-breast with a crumb she
had gathered at the door, to feed her chirping
young.
" The ducklings swam beside their mother in the
clear stream. The hen drew her chickens beneath
her wings, and screamed to the soaring hawk. The
spider threw out threads like lines of silver. She
fastened them from spray to spray, and ran lightly
on the bridge made from her own body.
c" The snail put his horned head through the door
of his house of shell, and drew it suddenly back.
36THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
The ant carried in her pincers a grain of corn, and
the loaded bee hastened to her hive, like a labourer
to his cottage.
"The dog came forth and guarded the young
lambs. They frisked fearlessly by the side of their
mothers, who with serious faces were cropping the
tender grass. All seemed full of happiness.
" I asked of them the way to happiness. But they
made no reply. Again and again I exclaimed,'which of you will teach me the way to be happy?'
And only echo answered, repeating'happy, happy,'
but not telling me how to become so."
"Hast thou looked upon all these," said the aged
man, "and yet received no instruction? Did not
the brook tell thee, it might not'stay to be idle, but
must haste to meet the river, and go with that to the
ocean, to do the bidding of ocean's king?
"Did it not say to thee, that it found pleasure by
the way, in refreshing tie trees that stretched their
~roots to meet it, and in giving drink to the flowers
that bowed themselves down to its face, with a kiss
of gratitude?
"Thou didst see the birds building their nests
among the cool, green branches, or flying with food
to nourish their unfledged young. And couldst thou
not perceive, that to make others happy is happiness?
"The young duck gave diligence to learn of its
mother the true use of its oary feet, and how to
balance its body in the deep waters. The chicken
obeyed the warning to hide itself under the shelter4

ing wing, though it was ignorant of the cruelty of
the foe from which it fled.
"And did they not bid thee seek with the same
obedience the lessons of thy mother, who every day
teacheth thee, and every night lifteth up a prayer
that thy soul may escape the destroyer and live forever?
" The spider's silken bower was swept away, and
she began another without murmuring or despondence. The snail willingly put forth all her strength
to bear her house upon her back; and the ant cheerfully toiled on with a load of corn to her winter
store house.
c" Thou sawest that the bee wasted not the smallest drop of sweetness that lingered in the honeycups, or among the bells of the flovers. And came
there no voice to thee from all these examples of
patience,and prudence and wisdom?
"Thou didst admire the shepherd's dog protecting
the helpless, and zealously doing the bidding of his
naster. How couldst thou fail to understand that
faithful continuance in duty is happiness?:" Froin all these busy teachers came ther]e no precept unto thee?'When each gave thee lessons, wert
thou deaf to their instruction? Did not the fields
lift up their hands, and tell thee that industry was
happiness, that idleness was an offence both to Natu):e and to her God?"
Then I bowed down my head upon my bosom,
and my cheek was crimson with shame. Because I
had not understood the lessons of the fields, and was
ignorant of what even birds and insects taught.
38THE GIRL S READING-BOOK,     39
But the man with hoary hairs comforted me. So,
I thanked him for his tenderness and wisdom. And
I took his precepts into my heart, that I might weigh
them and find if they were true. And though I
was then young, and now am old, I have never had
reason to doubt that these lessons of the fields
were good, and that to do the will of the Creator is
happiness.4                       CONTENTS.

EASY STUDIES.
I heard two girls, as they conversed. One said,
" I am sure I should not like to attend your school.
You have longer lessons than I choose to learn. Besides, I think they give you too hard studies. I
always prefer easy studies, and short lessons."
Afterwards, as I reflected, I could not help saying
to myself,-:" Now, I am afraid, that this lover of
short lessons, and easy studies,--if she lives to grow
up, and have the care of a family, will choose only
easy things, and become indolent, and negligent in
her duties.
" I am afraid that when she is a woman, and any
difficult thing presses on her, as it surely must, she
will be discouraged, or perhaps unamiable. For a
love of ease leads to selfishness, and selfishness to
an unhappy disposition and wrong conduct."
I once heard an excellent old lady say to her
grand children, "If you will do nothing but what is
easy, you will be neither a good mother, or a good
housekeeper. Your children will be neglected, and
your house out of order. You will complain of bad
help, and no help, for the care that is necessary to
make domestics faithful at their post, and contented
to remain there, you certainly will not be willing to
take.
"' The little girl," said she, " who will not learn to
do this, or that, because it is hard, will be apt to belong to that class, who do not like to keep house,
and must go to board,to live easy. But in trying to
AntHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
escape what they call troubles, they lose all those
pleasures of home, which make parents respectable,
and children happy."
The scholar, who loves only easy studies, and
short lessons, if she carries those habits of mind into
future life, will be in danger of becoming either a
vixen, or a drone. When cares and crosses meet
her, she will murmur under their burden, or decline
the labour that they impose.
It is a loss to know how to do nothinlg but what
is easy. Strength of intellect is acquired by conquering hard studies, and strength of character by
overcoming obstacles. She who is not willing to
contend with difficulties, is not fitted for this world.
The being who best knows for what end we were
placed here, has scattered in our path something
besides roses.
Especially is it a fault in our sex, to like only
easy things. Our business is to seek the happiness
of others rather than our own. Selfishness, in us, is
sin; for it wars with the design of our Creator.
And none can oppose his will, and be happy.
Avoid, therefore, the determination to choose short
lessons, and easy studies, lest the habits thus cherished, should make you a self-indulgent and helpless
woman. Gird yourself up to the race of life. Resolve that whatever your duty to God and man
requires, you will perform diligently and faithfully.
The females of ancient Rome had a po-wer of
endurance, and a contempt of hardships, which
caused them to be respected, even in a rude age.

are by higher. knowledge, and a purer faith, ought
surely not to be less energetic, or less disinterested.
The increased advantages of education, now enjoyed by the young, heighten the expectations of
their friends, and their responsibilities to God.
Their minds are no longer fettered, or held in darkness. Every talent finds fitting employment in the
broad field of christian duty and benevolence.
Time was, when the temple of Science was
barred against the foot of woman. Heathen tyranny held her in vassalage, and Mahometan prejudice
pronounced her without a soul. Now, f'rom the
sanctuary which knowledge and wisdom have consecrated, and from whence she was so long excluded, the interdict is taken away.
How will she receive the permission? How will
she prize the gift? Will she loiter at the threshold
of this magnificent temple? Will she amuse herself
in the outer courts, with those brief and gaudy flowers, which spring up wvhere is "no deepness of
earth?" Will she advance a few steps, and boast of
her own attainments, and twine'the garland of vanity
around her brow, and be satisfied with ignorance?
Or will she press to the inmost shrine of the temple of knowledge, among those patient and zealous
worshippers; whose " candle goeth not out by night?"
Dear young friends, who are favoured with the privileges of education, these questions are for you.
On those of mature age, habit has fastened her
chains, and set a seal on character. With you,
it is the forming period, the time of hope. Allureinents to indolence and vanity surround you. Rise

above them. Fix your standard high. Take for
your models the wisest and best of your sex.
Be active, while the dews of the morning are fresh
around you. Soon, the sun will oppress you with
its noon-day heat. It will find you toiling in steeper
paths, and wearied beneath heavier burdens. Then
you will wish to be refreshed with the rich fruits of
a refined intellect. May you not have to take up
the lamentation, "mine own vineyard have I not
kept."
The time must soon come, should your days be
prolonged, when you will be young no more. Life
will then be like a "twice-told tale." The present
will be disrobed of novelty, and the future of its
charm, and the mind will turn for solace to the gatherings of the past. Furnish now your intellectual
store-house for that day of need.
Be willing to labour for knowledge, to learn long
lessons, and to encounter difficult studies. Seek it
with a tireless spirit, and so use it, that all within
the sphere of your influence may rejoice in your
mental and moral excellence and be quickened by
your example to seek for " glory, honour, immortality, eternal life."
43THIE GIRL'S READING-BOOR.
OBEDIENCE.
NEXT to your duty to God, is your duty to your
parents. He has made them your guides, because
they are wiser than you, and love you better than
any other earthly friends. You cannot always understand the reason of their commands. It is not
necessary that you should. If you live to be as old
as they are, you will perceive that their restraints
were for your good.
Think of the miseries of orphanage. The greatest loss that can befal a child, is to be deprived of
pious and affectionate parents. While such blessings are continued to you, never be so ungrateful as
to distress them by disobedience. It is but a slight
payment for all their watchings over your infancy,
their care for your comfort, and patience with your
errors, to do faithfully and cheerfully the things
that they desire.
When your parents are absent, observe their commands with the same fidelity as if they were present.
The child who obeys only when under the eye of
a superior, has not learned obedience. He, who
seeth at all times, and in every place, is displeased with those who deceive their parents. He
hath promised to reward those who "honour their
father and their mother."
The principle of obedience, is the principle of
order and happiness. If there were no subordination in families, what comfort would be found there?
If pupils refused to obey the directions of their
44THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
teachers, what benefit could they receive from their
instructions? If in nations, the laws were disregarded, what safety would tllere be for the people?
Let the principle of obedience be rooted in love.
Take pleasure in obeying the commands of your
superiors. Even if you should have an opposing
wish, let there be no reluctance of manner or-countenance. I doubted the obedience of a child, whom
I once heard say to his mother, " I will go, when I
have done one or two little things."
But when I heard afterward, the mother asking
earnestly, " did you do as I bade yo?" I knew that
he was not an obedient child, though I did not hear
his answer. For if obedience had been habitual, his
mother would not have felt it necessary to inquire
if he had regarded her commands. She would not
have feared that he had neglected them, if his heart

It is ill-treatment of our dearest friends, to yield
to their wishes with a frowning brow, or a disagreeable deportment. Convince your parents and instructors by your attentions and alacrity, that you
are thankful for the trouble they take, in advising
and directing you.
No greater evil could happen to the young, than
for their older and wiser friends to withdraw their
control, and abandon them to their own inexperience. If your superiors gave you a piece of gold,
you would doubtless express your gratitude. But
when they impart to you of their wisdom, they
give you that which is of more value than gold.
When you are in school, feel it a privilege to be

there, and give your time and thought to the employments which your teachers mark out for you.
Keep all their rules. Consider it dishonourable to
break them. Make the wishes of your instructors
your own, and then you will acquire knowledge,
with pleasure to yourself and to them.
Treat old persons with respect. This is too apt to
be forgotten by the young, though the Bible commands, "to rise up before the face of the old man,
and honour the hoary head." We should fear to be
irreverent to those, whom the Almighty has enjoined us to honour.
The natives of this country, were observed by
our ancestors to be exemplary in their treatment of
the aged. The young rose up and gave place to
them. They bowed down reverently before them.
They solicited their opinion, and listened attentively
till they had done speaking.
The young men of the forest stood silenlt in their
councils, when the gray-haired chieftains opened
their lips. We should not be willing to have the
untutored Indian surpass us in a duty so graceful.
You remember that when a hoary-headed man once
entered a thronged assembly in Athens, and there
was no seat, the young people were so rude as to
laugh at his embarrassment. But when he was in
a similar situation at Sparta, the young arose and
made room. " The Athenians know what is right,"
said he, "but the Spartans practise it.;'

our duties, but disregard the obligations they impose. Whenever you meet an old person, rememAnTHE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.

of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness."
Shew respect to magistrates, and to all who are
in places of authority. There would be fewer mutinies and revolutions, if children were trained up in

and deference towards all whose station or virtues
claim them as their due. It was said of Washington, by his mother, that "his first lesson was to

By faithfully discharging your first and earliest
obligations, you will be prepared to act well your
part in future life. You will maintain good order
in your own families, and honour just government

only a few gray hairs where your bright locks now
grow, you will deserve from the young the same
cheerful obedience and grateful respect which you
have yourself shown to your superiors.

THIE GOOD DAUGHTER.
ELLEN'S mother died, when she was scarcely thirteen years old. Her only brother had died the winter before. Her two sisters were married, and had
removed to so great a distance, that she seldom
heard from them. She was quite alone with her
father.
When her mother first died, she felt as if she
never could be happy again. But when she saw her
father looking so sad, she thought it was her duty to
try to comfort him; and when he came in tired
from his work, she would set a chair for him, and
get him whatever he wanted, and speak pleasantly
to him, as her mother used to do.
She remembered how her mother made bread,
and was ambitious to make it in the same way. She
proportioned the articles just as she had seen her
do. When she kneaded the dough, she used all the
strength in her little arms. She took great pains to
have it light, and to bake it well, and when she
placed on the table the first loaf that she had ever
made, she could not help weeping for joy, to hear
her father say, " Child, this tastes like your mother's
bread."
She had often assisted in churning, but had never
taken the whole charge of making butter. But she
was anxious to try. She was careful to keep her
milk-pail and pans very clean and sweet. In working over the new butter, she patiently removed every
drop of butter-milk,. because she had heard her
48THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
mother say that this was necessary in order to have
it good.
The neighbours were pleased with the industry
of the little girl, and encouraged her in her housekeeping. She could not but miss her mother sadly,
and many times a day grieved for her loss. But she
went by herself to weep, for she said, " I will not
make my poor father more sad by my sorrow. He
has enough of his own to bear."
When winter evenings came, she swept the hearth
neatly, and placed the light on the little stand, and
sat down by his side with her needle. Her mother
had thoroughly instructed her in plain sewing, and
while she mended or made garments, her father
read aloud to her. He began to be comforted by the
goodness of his daughter, and she perceived that the
tones of his voice grew more cheerful in the evening
pray3er, and when he bade her good-night.
Her father worked hard every day. She had often
heard her mother say that they were poor, and
must economize. So as she grew older, she studied
how to save expense. She knew that her mother
made several very comfortable dishes with but a little
meat. So she learned to prepare soup in the same
way. Also, by putting thin layers of meat, with a
little pepper and salt, and some broken pieces of
bread, in a small pot, with a plenty of vegetables
from their own garden, and covering them close
until all was thoroughly stewed, a very nourishing
dish was ready, when her father came home to
dinner.
They had near the door, a tree of nice sweet ap5
49PREFACE.
To read well is a high accomplishment. It
is not onlly graceful in a female, but its results
rank among the virtues. It enables her to impart both instruction and pleasure. She may
thus make the evening fireside delightful, or
the wintry storm pass unheard. She may comfort the sick, and cheer the darkness of the
friend whose eye age has dimmed, and instil
into the unfolding mind lessons of wisdom.
But if she reads ill, she does injustice to the
author, to her hearers, and to- herself.
Great attention should be devoted to the art
of reading, during the elementary part of education. Wrong habits, then formed, are ex-.
ceedingly difficult to correct. Rapid, confused
elocution, false emphasis, monotony at the close
of sentences, or in the cadence of poetry, if
early indulged, will often be found adhesive
through life.
Teachers can scarcely impress too deeply
upon their scholars, that the first step towards
good reading, is to be undOstood. This probably requires more time and care than to read
gracefully. It is like the pedestal to the column, and must be safe and solid, or the superstructure suffers. An audible tone, a clear articulation, a correct pronunciation of every
word, and a strict regard to established pauises,

pies. Some of these she pared and laid in a deep
pan, mingling them with a few sour apples to produce a pleasant flavour, and covered the whole with
a thick crust, which she broke after it was baked,
and plunged into the warm apple-sauce. This made
a kind of pie of which her father was fond.
He also liked puddings, and she learned to make
several cheap and good ones. Among them was
one, she sometimes called the "Saturday pudding," because she baked it on Saturdays, that they
might have it for a Sunday dinner, cold in the summer, and in the winter warmed on the coals; for they
were not accustomed to cook on that day, as they
both felt it a privilege to go to church.
She made this simple pudding by picking over
and washing a gill of rice, to which she added a
spoonful or two of brown sugar, and after letting it
soak a while in three pints of milk, baked it. She
felt it a pleasure to learn every thing, however small,
that would make her father comfortable, and a duty
to do it prudently.
Her mother had been accustomed to sell what
butter'they could spare, to a lady in the neighbouro
hood. Ellen continued to do so, and the lady expressed herself much surprised that so young a girl
should make so fine butter, and send it in such neat
order. If she ever felt fatigued with her labours,
she would recollect her mother's example, and
always be pleasant and cheerful when her father
came home.
She had been early taught to knit and to spin,
and remembered to have heard her mother say, that
50THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
stockings made from wool which was carded in the
house, lasted much longer than that which was prepared at the factories, because the machine cut the
wool so fine, as to impair its strength. She wished
to avail herself of this knowledge, but found she
could not succeed in preparing such smooth rolls as
she had seen her mother spin.
So she took the wool to a neighbour, who was
experienced in such work, and offered if she would
teach her how to prepare it, to sew for her
until she was satisfied with the payment. " That I
will, my good girl," said she, "or any thing else you
wish me to help you about, for we all love you for
taking such care of your father. Your wrists are
not strong enough yet to break and card this long
wool, and I shall be glad to have you make an apron
for my baby."
After the rolls were made, she spun them into
very even yarn, and having heard her father say
that he thought stockings were warmer and set
closer for being seamed, she finished him two pair
of long ones for winter, by knitting two stitches
plain, and seaming the third, and was delighted to
see how entirely they pleased him.
Having an active mind, she began to think of
some improvement in economy, and proposed that
he should purchase from a man for whom he worked,
a lamb or a sheep; "for it can get its living with
the cow," said she, " and we can use its wool for
stockings, and then you will not be obliged to buy."
But, with all her prudence, she was not covetous,
and many a little pair of thick stockings did she knit
51THIE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
for poor children, and many a neatly mended garment which she thought they could spare, did she
carry to the sick; for economy and generosity are
often found together.
When Ellen grew to be a young woman, she was
a favourite with all. The old and thoughtful respected her for her obedience and affection to her
only parent, who no longer felt lonely, so comfort
able and cheerful had she made his home. She was
also quite admired, for she had a good person, a
healthful complexion, and the open smile of one
who is in the habit of doing right, and feels happy
at heart, which is the truest beauty.
When her young friends visited her, though she
was fond of society, she did not forget that her first
duty was to her father. However agreeable they
were, as soon as the appointed time for his family
devotions came, she would say in the gentlest manner, "my father has been long used to retire at
nine." And those who were the most unwilling to
leave her, could not but respect her for attention
to his wishes.
She was addressed by a deserving young man,
who had known her merits from childhood. To his
proposal she replied, "My father is growing infirm,
and is able to work but little. I feel it my duty to
take care of him aslong as he lives. It might be a
burden to others. It is a pleasure to me."
"Ellen, it will be no burden to me. Let me help
you in supporting him. Most gladly will I work for
all." She saw that he was sincere, and they were
married. Her husband had a small house and a
52THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
piece of ground on which he laboured. She kept
every thing neat and in order, and was always pleasant and cheerful. "I have now twoo motives," she
said, "to be as good as I can,-a husband and a
father."
Ellen's little children loved their hoary grandfather. She taught them by her own example how
to treat him with respect.  The warmest corner
was always for him. When they saw her listening
to all he said with reverence, they never thought of
interrupting him, or disregarding his remarks. As
he was deaf, she raised her voice when she spoke to
him, in a steady, affectionate tone, and they learned
to do the same.
As they grew older, they read the Bible to him
daily, for his eyesight failed.  His explanations
were a treasure to them. Especially was he pleased
when any of them learned to repeat by heart some
of the Psalms of David.  "For these," he said,
" have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage."
Teachers, and others, who saw the children of
Ellen, observed that they had better manners than
others of the same age. They acquired them, in a
great measure, from their constant propriety of deportment to their venerable grandfather. To pay
respect to age,is a benefit both to the manners and
character of children. It is an advantage to them
to live under the same roof with a pious old person,
provided they show them that reverence which the
Bible commands.
Ellen reaped a part of the reward of her,filial duty,

in seeing her children made better, and her father
happy. In his last sickness all waited upon him.
When he was no longer able to raise his head from
the clean pillow where it was laid, he thanked God
who had put it into the heart of his daughter to
nourish him with a never-failing kindness, and he
blessed her and her husband, and their little ones.
Death came for him, and his eyes grew dim, and
they were no longer able to warm his feet and
hands. Ellen raised him up in his bed, and sat
behind him, and wrapped her arms tenderly around
hinm, for she saw that he shivered. And most touching was it to hear him say, as he leaned his head
upon her shoulder for the last time, " The Lord bless
thee and keep thee; the Lord make his face to shine
upon thee; th.e Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
THE SICK.
As sickness is at some time or other the lot of all,
it is well to learn, while young, how to treat those
who are sick, and how to conduct when we are ourselves so. The care of the sick is peculiarly the business of our sex. Therefore, even little girls should
be trained to wait upon them, and to sympathize in
their sufferings.
Sickness is an evil, not only because it brings pain,
but because it prevents us from being useful. We
should consider good health as a precious gift from:our Heavenly Father, and avoid any imprudence by
which it is endangered. If we are necessarily exposed to cold, we should guard ourselves with thick
clothing, especially about the feet. Shun the folly
of wearing thin stockings in winter, or thin shoes
when the streets are wet.
Sickness, that comes through imprudence, is attended with self-reproach. We have no right to
sport with our health. This wonderful frame, fashioned by an Almighty Hand, this temple of the
immortal spirit, was not intended for us to mar and
deface, as fashion or folly dictate. We should impart the earliest indications of ill-health to those
who have the care of us, as a slight remedy taken
in season often prevents a formidable complaint.
When you are seriously sick, give yourself up
entirely to those who have the care of you. Take
without objection whatever they bring you, however unpleasant to the taste. Sickness is not a time
5556          THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
to gratify the palate, but to learn patience. Thank
those who perform any service for you, however
small. Do not add to their fatigue any more than
you can help. If you see them standing long by
your bed, request them to take a seat.
If you have watchers, urge them to take refreshment in the course of the night, and, if possible, to
get some repose. These attentions are pleasant to
those who nurse you, and help to turn your thoughts
from self, for selfishness is too prone to intrude into
the chamber of sickness. Consider your physician
as your friend. Tell him frankly all he asks, and
submit to his remedies without opposition.
Open your mind to cheering thoughts, and keep
your heart full of hope, for they promote recovery.
Spread your case before the Great Physician, and
ask his blessing on every remedy. When you are
well agaifn, remember that you are under a renewed
weight of gratitude to Him, and to those who have
watched over you, and shown you kindness, and
from your own sufferings learn to pity others who
suffer.
The first thing to be considered in your treatment
of the sick, is to avoid whatever might disturb them.
This seems a slight attainment, and yet is not always understood even by professed nurses. A child
should be taught to avoid loud noises and laughter,
heavy footsteps, and careless shutting of doors,
when any one is sick in the house. And the more
delicate attentions of shading the light from the
face, or the lamp from the eye, and avoiding in the
warming of drinks, or the arrangement of the fire,TIIE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
every sudden and shrill sound, should be familiar to
all in attendance.
Move with the greatest quietness around the chamber of the sick, and when you speak to them, do so
with a pleasant smile, and a soft, low tone. When
you carry any little delicacy to an invalid, arrange
it with perfect neatness, and if you can, with taste.
These little circumstances are observed by them,
and have a cheering effect. If you send them fruit, or
sweetmeats, dispose them so as to make an agreeable
appearance. If you lay a nosegay upon their pil-.
low, let it be fresh and beautiful; and so place every
flower, that its form and colouring may be most
easily discerned.
Remember the sick poor. Learn to make proper
drinks or nourishing broths for them with your own
hands. Visit them, and ascertain if their clothing
and beds are comfortably provided, and converse
with your parents and older friends respecting their
situation. Such habits are valuable in the young,
and should be cherished by those who have the
charge of their education, as far as circumstances
will admit.
I once knew a little girl, who, when her mother
had a headache, would glide around the house like
a shadow, with her finger on her lip, to remind the
other children to be silent. I have seen her, when
her aged grandmother could not sleep for nervousness, pass within the curtains, and press for a long
time her temples with a soft, gentle hand, and then
breathe low in her ear the simple tones of lulling music, till she was composed to slumber. And Ijoyed to'5758          THE GIRL S READING-BOOK.
see in her thus early, the elements of woman's purer
and better nature.
It is well that kind sympathies should take deep
root in the heart of young females. For our sex should
ever bgar about with them a nursing tenderness for
all who suffer. In ancient times, ladies of high
rank and wealth used to go to hospitals and almshouses to visit the sick. Bending over their wretched beds, they did not shrink to perform kind offices
for the most nliserable. The " blessing of him who
was ready to perish came upon them." Let none
of us feel that we are too young to do something
for the comfort of the sick.THE GIRL'S READING-BOO.           59
THE POOR.
THE sacred Scriptures say, "' the poor we have always with us." It is the duty of the young, as well
as those who are grown up, to study the best means
of relieving them. The kind feelings, the benevolent sympathies, that are thus called forth, bless the
giver as well as the receiver.
If you see a child in the winter shivering and
thinly clad, make some inquiry into his situation.
Perhaps you will find that his parents are burdened
with too large a family to make all comfortable, or
that his mother is a widow, or that he is an orphan.
Then, if you can do any thing for his relief, or excite others to do so, it will be the means of increasing
your own happiness.
It is a good plan to repair neatly your cast-off garments, and now:and then to knit a pair of coarse
stockings, and to lay aside a part of any money that
may be given you, to be in readiness for the claims
of the poor. Never feel unwilling to give whatever
you can spare, but consider the favour on your side,
so great is the pleasure of benevolence.
The young should always solicit the advice of
their parents, or older friends, in their charities.
The judicious relief of the poor, requires more
knowledge of mankind, than those whose years are
few can be expected to possess. Above all, never
boast of any thing you give. It is an offence against
the nature of true charity, which " vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up."must be enforced, ere the pupil ascends to a
higher gradation.
Would that I could arouse both teacher and
scholar to greater zeal and thoroughness in this
branch of education. I wish every young female in our land, who enjoys the benefit of
scholastic training, might persevere in the art
of reading, until she is able to convey the delicate shades of thought, of the most refined
writer, clearly and agreeably to the mind of another.
I have myself been a teacher. Some of the
happiest years of my life were thus spent.
Henceforth, all teachers and all scholars are to
me as friends. Especially am I interested in
the young of my own sex. For them this volume has been framed, on the principle of combining with the accomplishment of reading,
sentiments that are feminine in their character,
and knowledge that enters into the elements of
woman's duty. May it be to them as the voice
of a friend, and continue to speak words of instruction and love, long after the hand that prepared it shall moulder in the grave.

PREFACE.THE GIRLIS READING-BOOK.
Let me tell you of the girls of a school,who pitied
the poor, and formed themselves into a society fo
their relief. They had only Saturday afternoon for
recreation during the week, and they resolved to
meet at that time, and devise means how they might
best be assisted. Their parents gave permission,
and their teacher allowed them to meet in the schoolroom.
There, I have often seen them busy with their
needles, their bright eyes sparkling with happiness,
and their sweet voices consulting about their plans
of charity, like a band of sisters. And I blessed
them in my heart, and besought that the spirit of
grace and consolation might ever dwell among them.
For they were my own scholars, and I loved them
as children.
They we.re not soon weary in well-doing. Many
garments were repaired and made, many pair of
stockings knit, many books distributed among the
ignorant. They established a monthly contribution,
and decided, that the money which they devoted to
it should be the fruit of their own industry.
They employed themselves with their needles,
and received from the friends for whom they worked,
a regular price, which was sufficient for their charities. That this new labour need not interfere with
their appointed lessons, or their necessary recreations, they rose an' hour earlier in the morning, and
thus secured time for all.
Their Society was regularly organized, and among
its officers were four almoners, who, in distributing
their bounty, visited the houses of the poor, and
60THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
made report respecting them. An interesting child,
who was deaf and dumb, once accompanied these
almoners. In her strong language of signs and gestures, she related what she had seen in an abode of
poverty.'It was a small, low room," said she. " The stairs
were dark and broken. The snow through which
we had walked was deep, and my feet felt very cold.
But there was not fire enough to warm them. No.
I could have held in one of my hands those very
few, faint coals. And there was no wood.
"c The sick woinan lay in a low bed. If she sat
up, she shivered, and she was covered with scant
and thin clothing. Her pale baby threw up its arms
and cried. But there was no physician there. Then
the father came in, having in his hand some pieces
of pine, which he had picked up. He laid them on
the fire. But how soon were they burned up and
gone.
"His wife spoke to him, and when he answered,
she looked sorry. Because I was deaf and durlb, I
knew not what they were saying. So, I asked my
friend. And she told me the poor woman said to
her husband,'have you not bought a piece of candle?' When he answered'no, I have no money,'
she said, with sadness,' must we be in the dark another long, cold night, with our sick baby?"
As the tender-hearted child went on to describe,
in her own peculiar dialect, the smiles that came
suddenly over the faces of the sorrowing poor, at
the unexpected bounty which she aided in bearing,
tears of exquisite feeling glistened in her eyes; for
6

her heart was awake to every generous sensibility,
though her sealed lips were precluded from their
utterance.
One of the best modes of assisting the poor, is
through their own industry. To give them work,
and pay them promptly and liberally, is far better
than to distribute alms, which may sometimes encourage idleness, or be perverted to vice. It also
saves that self-abasement which minds of sensibility
suffer, at receiving charity.
To remove ignorance, is an important branch of
benevolence. Study the art of explaining, in simple
and kind words, their duty to those who fall into
error for want of instruction. To distribute useful
and pious books among those who are able to read,
is an excellent form of bounty. They should be
plainly written. A part of your money for the poor
will be well devoted to their purchase.
Read the books that you intend to distribute, attentively, before you buy them. Be sure that there
is nothing in their contents, but what is intended to
benefit the reader. Make a list of such books, with
your opinion respecting them. Mention why you
think they will be useful, and then you can give a
reason for recommending them to others, who may
desire to instruct the ignorant.
The biographies of those who have been distinguished for usefulness or piety, are excellent to awaken the spirit of imitation. If you are not able to
purchake many, get one, and let it be easy of comprehension. If you are not able to give it away,
lend it, and when it is returned, converse with theTHE GIRL:S READING-BOOK.
persons who have read it, and try to impress on their
hearts the examples most worthy of being imitated.
Thus by the gift, or the loan of books, you may
be scattering around you the seeds of usefulness
and piety. You may do more lasting good than by
the gift of clothing or money, which soon pass
away, and may be misused. When you relieve the
wants of the body, always remember the soul. For
how greatly will it add to your happiness, when you
grow up, to know that you have enlightened the
mind of but one child, and assisted in making him
wiser and better.
Do nothing charitable, from vanity, or a desire of
having your good deeds known and applauded.
Let your motives be, obedience to your Creator, and
love for those whom he has created. They are all
his family. He has breathed life into their bosoms.
He watches over them. He has given them immortal souls.
Some have black or olive complexions, some are
red like the roving tribes of our forests, and others
white. But "he hath made of one blood, all who
dwell upon the face of the whole earth." They inhabit different climes, but the same sun gives them
warmth, the same clouds send down rain to refresh
them.
Some wrap themselves in furs, or dig subterranean
cells, to shelter themselves from the cold of winter.
Others, in slight garments of cotton or silk, can
scarcely endure the parching heat of their long
summers. Some feed upon the rich fruits that a
63THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
tropical sun ripens. Others hunt the flying animals
through the forest for their sustenance.
Some drink the juice of the palm-tree, some press
the liquor from the grape, some refresh themselves
at the fountains of pure water. Some slumber in
their quiet homes, and others upon the tossing,
treacherous sea. Yet the same fatherly hand- provides for all.
He who called all mankind forth from the dust of
the earth, views thern as one large family, seated at
one common table, and soon to lie down in one wide
bed, the grave. We see, perhaps, but one little corner of the table. We see varieties of dress, complexion, and rank, and suffer our feelings to be affected by these changeful circumstances.
We behold one exalted upon a high seat, and we
say, "he is more excellent than his neighbour."'
From those who hold the lowest places, or "gather
up the crumbs under the table," perhaps, we turn
away. Do we forget the great Father of all, who
appointed their stations? who looketh only on the
heart?
It must be pleasing to him who hath called himself in his Holy Scriptures a God of love, that all
his large family should regard each other as brethren
and sisters. Let us think of our fellow creat.ures, as
under the care of that Merciful Parent from whom
all our blessings proceed, and let our good deeds to
those who are less fortunate than ourselves, have
root in love.

EARLY RECOLLECTIONS.
The years of my childhood past away in contentment and peace. My lot was in humble and simple
industry. Yet my heart was full of gladness, though
I scarcely knew why. I loved to sit under the
shadow of the rugged rocks, and to hear the murmured song of the falling brook.
I made to myself a companionship among the
things of nature, and was happy all the day. But
when evening darkened the landscape, I sat down
pensively. For I was alone, and had neither brother
or sister.
I was ever wishing for a brother who should be
older than myself, into whose hand I might put my
own, and say, " Lead me forth to look at the solemn
stars, and tell me of their names." Sometimes, too,
I wept in my bed, because there was no sister to
lay her head upon the same pillow.
At twilight, before the lamps were lighted, there
came up out of my bosom, what seemed to be a
friend. I did not then understand that its name was
Thought. But I talked with it, and it comforted me.
I waited for its coming, and whatsoever it asked of
me, I answered.
When it questioned me of my knowledge, I said,
"I know where the first fresh violets of spring
grow, and where the lily of the vale hides in its
broad green sheath, and where the vine climbs to
hang its purple clusters, and where the forest nuts

65THE GIRL7S READING-BOOK.
ripen, when Autumn comes with its sparkling
frost.
"I have seen how the bee nourishes itself in
winter, with the essence of flowers, which its own
industry embalmed; and I'have learned to draw
forth the kindness of domestic animnals, and to tell
the names of the birds which build dwellings in
my father's trees."
- Then thought inquired, " what knowest thou of
those who reason, and to whom God has given dominion over the beasts of the, field, and over the
fowls of the air?"  I confessed, that of my own race
I knew nothing, save of the parents who nurtured
me, and the few children with whom I had played
on the sumnmer turf.
I was ashamed, for I felt that I was ignorant. So
I determined to turn away from the wild herbs of
the field, and the old trees where I had helped the
gray squirrel to gather acorns, and to look attentively upon what passed among men.
I wvalked abroad when the morning dews were
lingering upon the grass, and the white lilies drooping their beautiful heads to shed tears of joy, and
the young rose blushing, as if it listened to its own
praise. Nature smiled upon those sweet children,
that were so soon to fade.
But I turned toward those whose souls have the
gift of reason, and are not born to die. I s-aid, " if
there is joy in the plant that flourishes for a day,
and in the bird bearing to its nest but a broken
cherry, and in the lamb that has no friend but its

mother, how much happier must they be, who are
surrounded with good things, as by a flowing river,
and who know that, though they seem to die, it is
but to live forever."
I looked upon a group of children. They were
untaught and unfed, and clamoured loudly with
wayward tongues. I asked them why they walked not in the pleasant paths of knowledge. And
they mocked at me. I heard two who were called
friends, speak harsh words to each other, and was
affrighted at the blows they dealt.
I saw a man with a fiery and a bloated face. He
was built strongly, like the oak among trees. Yet
his steps were weak and unsteady as those of the
tottering babe. He fell heavily, and lay as one
dead. I marvelled that no hand was stretched out
to raise him up.
I saw an open grave. A widow stood near it,
with her little ones. They looked downcast, and
sad at heart. Yet methought, it was famine and
misery, more than sorrow for the dead, which had
set on them such a yellow and shrivelled seal.
I said, "what can have made the parents not pity
their children when they hungered, nor call them
home when they were in wickedness q What made
the friends forget their early love? and the strong
man fall down senseless? and the young die before
his time?" I heard a voice say "Intemperance!
And there is mourning in the land, because of
this."
So I returned to my home, sorrowing. And had
67THE GIRL'S READING-EOOK.
God given me a brother or a sister, I would have
thrown my arms around their neck, and entreated,
" touch not your lips to the poison cup, and letus
drink the pure water, which God hath blessed, all
the days of o.ur lives."
Again I went forth. I met a beautiful boy weeping, and I asked him why he wept. He answered,
"because my father went to the wars and is slain;
he will return no more." I saw a mournful woman.
The sun shone upon her dwelling. The honeysuckle climbed to its windows, and sent in its sweet
blossoms to do their loving message. But she was
a widow. Her husband had fallen in battle. There
was joy for her no more.
I saw a hoary man, sitting by the wayside. Grief
had made furrows upon his forehead, and his garmnerits were thin and tattered. Yet he asked not for
charity. And when I besought him to tell me why
his heart was heavy, he replied faintly, " I had a
son, an only one. From his cradle, I toiled, that
he might have food and clothing, and be taught
wisdom.
"l He grew up to bless me. So all my labour and
weariness were forgottei. When he became a man,
I knew no want; for he cherished me: as I had
cherished him. Yet he left me to be a soldier.
He was slaughtered in the field of battle. Therefore, mine eye runneth down with water, because

I' said, " shew me, I pray thee, a field of battle, that

I may know what war means." But he answered,
" Thou art not able to bear the sight." " Tell me,
then," I entreated, " what thou hast seen, when the
battle was done."
"5 I came," he said,': at the close of day, when the
cannon ceased their thunder, ahd the victor and vanquished had withdrawn. The rising moon looked
down on the pale faces of the dead. Scattered over
the broad plain were many who still struggled with
the pangs of death.
"They stretched out the shattered limb, yet there
was no healing hand. They strove to raise their
heads, but sank deeper in the blood which flowed
from their own bosoms. They begged in God's
name that we would put them out of their misery,
and their piercing shrieks entered into my soul.
" Here and there, horses mad with pain, rolled and
plunged, mangling with their hoofs the dying, or
defacing the dead. And I remembered the mourning for those who lay there-of the parents who had
reared them, or of the young children who used to
sit at home upon their knee."
Then I said, " tell me no more of battle or of war,'for my heart is sad." The silver haired man raised
his eyes upward, and I kneeled down by his side.
And he prayed, " Lord, keep this child from
anger and hatred and ambition, which are the seeds
of war. Grant to all that own the name of Jesus,
hearts of peace, that they may shun every deed of
strife, and dwell at last in the country of peace,
even in heaven."

EDUCATION.
WHAT is a good education? We hear much about
it. Who will tell us what it is? Every child in
school expects to obtain it. But it is necessary that
they should first know what it nleans.
Is it to get lessons well, and to excel in every
study?  This is a part, but not all. Some make
great progress for a time, and then become indolent.
Others are distinguished while they go to school,--
but when they leave it, cease to improve.
Is it a knowledge of books? Yes, and something
more. It is possible to possess learning, and be
ignorant of necessary things.  There was a lady
who read mqay books, yet did not know if her dress;
was in a proper condition, and could not always find
her way home, when she went abroad.
Is it to cultivate the intellect? This is not enough.
It must also strengthen the moral principles, and
regulate the affections. It must fit for the peculiar
duties that devolve upon us. It must keep in just
balance, and bring forth to healthful action, all the
powers that the Creator has given us.70          THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
Hastening home, I besought my mother, " shelter
me, as I have been sheltered, in solitude, and in
love. Bid me turn the wheel of industry, or bring
water from the fountain, or tend the plants of the

THE GOOD SISTER.
THE village-bell tolled. Groups of people were
seen slowly assembling at the funeral call. The
hearse stood before the door of a small house, with
a vine-wreathed porch. There the minister lifted
up his solemn voice in supplication, that the living
might be supported in their bitter parting with the
dead. A feeble wail from the chamber mingled
with his prayer. It was the moan of the young infant from whom its mother had been suddenly taken.
hen the mournful family returned from the
grave, the oldest daughter folded the babe in her
arms, and pressed its little face long to hers. Tears
flowed fast down her cheeks, as she said, "I will be
a mother to you, my poor little one." And the
upward glance of her eye told, that her heart was
asking of her Father in heaven, wisdom to supply
to it the place of that good parent whom he had
taken to himself.
" What will poor Mr. Allen do, now he has lost
his wife?" said one of the neighbours. " He is not
able to hire a nurse, and to hear the poor baby crying all the time the minister was at ptayer, was
quite heart-rending." "Do you not know," said her
friend, " that Lucy, the eldest girl, has undertaken
the care of it? It is truly wonderful to see one so
young preparing its food so well, and waking patiently in the night to feed it, and so anxious to learn
how to nurse it when it is sick. We must go in and
encourage her.".
71THE GIRL5S READlNG-BOOK.
Lucy Allen was very careful to mingle the milk
for the babe in just proportion, and to give it at regular intervals. She washed and dressed it early in
the morning, with the greatest tenderness, and lulled
it to rest at the proper hours. She sat by her sad
father through the long winter evenings. The babe
lay sleeping in its cradle by their side. If it awaked,
she rocked and lulled it with a tender voice, and her
father blessed her.
It was a beautiful sight, to see that fair young girl,
week after week, nourishing the feeble infant.
Sometimes, when her gay companions urged her to
go with them and spend the evening, she would say,
" the baby is not quite well, and I am afraid to leave
it so long." " 0, you will make a mope of yourself
for that baby. I dare say it can do well enough
awhile without you." But Lucy would excuse herself by saying, that her father looked lonely, and
since her dear mother's death, she took more pleasui'e in being at home with him, than in going out as
formerly.
The babe inclined to cry and be fretiful. Lucy
said it was irritable, because it was unwvell, and as
it grew stronger, it would grow more quiet. And
so it proved. She attended to its health, and after a
few months, its fits of crying abated. It grew lively,
and began to have a ruddy cheek. She always spoke
to it in a cheerful voice, and looked at it with a
smile, for she saw that this seemed to make it happier: and said, " poor, dear child, it has no mother to
comfort it, and all I can do is so much less than she
would have done, that I feel sorry for it."
72THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
Lucy lhad not been accustomed to be disturbed in
her rest. When she was kept waking a great part
of the night, as she sometimes was, while the babe
was getting teeth, she could not help feeling tired
and weak in the morning. But she never complained. She remembered how patiently her mother had
nursed the others in their sicknesses, and tried to
imitate her. And when the little one began to walk,
and when the first word it lisped was her name, and
when it stretched forth its arms to her, as to a mother, she felt more than repaid for all her toil.
But it was not the care of the infant alone, that
exercised Lucy's affection and patience. She had
two other sisters and brothers, to whom she tried to
fill a mother's place. The sister next to herself in
age, was about thirteen, and assisted much in the
work of the family. She was not, however, always
amiable, and was sometimes jealous that Lucy intended to rule her. But by mildness and kindness,
she succeeded in convincing her that she had only
her good in view, and induced her to try to regulate
lier temper and improve her character.
The two brothers were eleven and nine years old.
Lucy took great care that they should have their
lessons ready for school, and that they should be
there in season, and neatly dressed, with clean hands
and faces She charged them not to keep company
with bad boys, and gave them the same advice about
truth and honesty, and respect for age, and reverence for the sabbath, which her pious mother had
given to her.
One morning, the youngest boy came running in7
73THE GIRL S READING-BOOK.
"c Sister Lucy, I have cut my finger dreadfully. I
did it in cutting a thick board with father's sharp
knife." She instantly produced the basket, in which
she kept lint, and soft pieces of old linen, and salve,
and cotton bats for burns, and proceeded to do it up
skilfully. But the tears flowed afresh. " Does it pain
you much, little brother?"; Yes. But the worst
of it is, father told me not to touch that knife, and I
am afraid to tell him."
"You have done very wrong to disobey your father. But you must own to him exactly how it was.
Faults are made worse by concealment. I renlember an old, school-mistress, who used to tell us,'speak truth, and let the sky fall.' And it was
right advice, because God is a God of truth, and requires truth of all who hope to live in heaven at
last."
Her little brother promised her that he would con
fess his fault. But she saw that he was very much
afraid, and remembered that her father was sometimes inclined to be severe,, and her heart yearned
towards the child. So, she went out to meet him,
when she saw him coming home, and told him that
her little brother had done wrong, but had suffered
in consequence, and seemed penitent. The boy confessed his fault, and the father forgave his disobedience, for the sake of Lucy's intercession.
The youngest girl was scarcely six. Between
herself and the babe there had been another, who
died, and she, in consequence of this, had been
much indulged. Lucy felt the great importance that
her moral training should have vigilant attention.
74'l.' GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
She iused towards her great gentleness and firmness,
and was always consistent, so that her word was relied on and respected. Soon the child became obedient, and being very affectionate, grew happy, and
every day more attached to her sister.
The principal fault of the little sister was thoughtlessness. Lucy took great pains to teach her to attend, and to remember. She was very apt to meet
with accidents, to tear her clothes, or to lose her
little possessions. Lucy never upbraided her, for
she said this was the way to make children badtempered or deceitful. But she steadily exerted herself to make her think what she was about, and to
put things in the right place.
The second sister would often speak harshly to
the little one, when any accident befel her, through
what seemed to be her own carelessness. But Lucy
begged her not to do so, and said, " to scold at a
child, makes them learn to scold also, if they dare;
and if they dare not, frightens.them into falsehood."
So, the child, when she tore her frock or her apron,
brought it trustingly to Lucy's needle, and heed ed,
out of gratitude, the advice that she gave her.
The father was greatly comforted by Lucy's goodness. When he told her so, she felt that it was an
over-payment for all her toil. Her brothers and sisters, as they grew up, blessed their good sister.
When ever she was in doubt respecting her duty to
them, she asked herself, what would my dear' mother have done? If the duty was difficult, she retired to her chamber, and prayed to Him, from

strength that she needed.
All who knew Lucy Allen admired her conduct.
The mothers wished for such a daughter, and the
young for such a friend. She was considered more
beautiful than those who flaunted in fine dress,
or sought for fashionable amusement; for the warmest, purest affections beamed in her face, and they
are the true beauty of the heart. But happy as she
was, in the'love of all the good, she felt the highest
thrill of pleasure, when the babe that she had reared
to a healthful and fair child, came to her with all its
little joys and sorrows, saying, that 1" better than all

TIlE TRUE FRIEND.
YOUNG persons are fond of agreeable society. A
lonely room, or a solitary evening, does not suit their
cheerful temperament. They are willing to bear fatigue, the heat of the summer's sun, or the storm of
winter, to meet a pleasant companion.
They naturally wish to obtain a friend, in whom
they can confide. They read much of the pleasures
of friendship, and are anxious to possess a treasure
which the wise and good extol.
Shall I tell you of a pleasant companion, and a
true friend, who is always near, and whose acquaintance may be readily secured? Should you ever live
far from neighbours, or be divided from your parents
and relatives, such an acquisition would be highly
valuable.
First, let me describe this friend to you. She is
exceedingly like yourself. Her eyes and the tones
of her voice are the saime. When you are good and
happy, she smiles also. In your sorrows she sympathizes. She makes your joys her own.
You perceive that she has the qualities of a good
friend. In one respect, she will be better to you
than any other. The dearest friends die and leave
us. We mourn in desolation over their graves. But
the friend of whom I speak, has the assurance of
living as long as you do, and at your own death-bed
will be nearer to you than the nearest relation.
She might say to you in the beautiftul language of
Ruth,' whither thou goest, I will go; vwhere thou

lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my peopie,
and thy God my God; where thou diest, I will die,
and there will I be buried; the Lord do so to me,
and more also, if aught but death part thee and me."
Will you be introduced to this friend? She has
some peculiarities, of wrhich it is but right to inform
you. When you try daily to improve, and are industrious, and affectionate, and pious, she is in good
health. But when you fail in your duties, she is
sick and sad, and no common physician can under
stand her case, or give her medicine.
If you persist in doing wrong, she has a way
of hanging a heavy weight in your breast, which
those who have felt it, say is a severe punishment.
She is said also to have some tendency to jealousy,
and not to like the presence of a third person, at her
particular interviews.
But though she wishes exclusive attention during
the period devoted to her, she is not unreasonable
in her claims upon your time. Half an hour out of
the twenty-four, will content her. And she chooses
this half hour should be the last before retiring,
when the business of the, day is done.
She requires that you should be punctual to meet
her at the appointed time, and frank in replying to
all the questions she may see fit to propose. And
now, will you cultivate an intercourse with this personage? It will certainly do you no harm. Can
this be said of all with whom you associate?
Those who have made the greatest progress in her
intimacy, acknowledge that the beginning was rather
awkward, for she is averse to flattery, and apt to

blame what is wrong. But as they persevere, it becomes delightfutl, and her smile is a rich reward for
every toil.
If you wish to enlarge the circle of your acquaintaince by such a friend, tell her so. Promise to conform to her modes of conversation. Sit down alone,
and wait for her, when the cares and employments
of the day, like shut roses, are drinking the dews
of slumber.
While you meditate, she is near. When you hear
a still voice, like a soft breath passing over your
cheek, be ready to answer with truth, such questions
as the following: " Did you rise early this morning?
and were your first thoughts turned to Him who
protected you through the night, and is alone able
to sustain you through the day?
" Have you realized the value of time, and laboured to improve it? Have you been obedient to your
parents and teachers, and respectful to the aged?
"Have you been affectionate to your brothers,
sisters, and companions, and tried to promote the
comfort of all with whom you dwell? Have you
instructed the ignorant? or relieved the poor? or
shown kindness to the sick and sorrowful?
" Have you been patient when you were disappoint.ed, and restrained your temper when you were
provoked? Did you repress vanity, and in' all lowliness of mind, esteem others better than yourself?'
"Have you preserved a cheerful countenance and
manners, and tried to make all around you happy?
Shall your last act, before you retire to rest, be, to
thank the Almighty Father for all his mercies, and

A good education, is that which prepares us for
our future sphere of action. A warrior or a states--
man, require a different kind of training from a
mother, or the instructress of a school. A lady who
has many accomplishments, yet is deficient in the
science of housekeeping, has not been well educated.
A good education makes us contented with our
lot. This, was what an ancient philosopher said,
niade him happy in an obscuie abode, and when he
was alone, talked with him. A restless, and complaining temper, proves a bad education.
A good education is a fortune in itself. I do not
mean that it will always secure wealth. But it brings
something better than the gold that perishes. For
this may be suddenly lost. Fire may consume it.
Water may overwhelm it. The tempest may destroy
it. The thief may taketit away.
But that knowledge which enriches the mind,
which moderates its desires, which teaches to make
a right iuse of time, and to promote the happiness of
others, is superior to the elements. Fire, air, earth,
and water, have no power over it. It can rule them
as servants. It fears neither rust nor robber. It
walks with us into the vale of years, and does not
leave us till we die.
What a great evil is ignorance! We can see this
by the state of those countries where it prevails.
The history of past times will show us how miserable were their inhabitants, how unfit to judge for
themselves,--how stubborn in wickedness,-how
low in their pleasures,-how ready to be the prey of

THE HAPPY FAMILY.
I ONCE passed several months under the roof of a
farmer. It was to me one of the pleasantest and
most profitable visits I had ever made. For I saw
continually around me, that industry, economy, and
contentment, which make every rational household
happy.
The whole family rose before the sun. After an
early breakfast, every one proceeded to the business
of the day. The farmer and his sons went with
their workmen to the field. The swift strokes of
the churn were heard, changing the rich cream to
the golden-coloured butter. I was never weary of
watching the progress of the cheese, from its first
consolidation, to its reception in the press, and its
daily attentions in the dairy.
Above stairs, the sound of the loom, and the
flight of the shuttle, allured me. There, various
fabricks for the comfort of the family were wrought
out, from the carpet on which they trod, to the
snowy linen that covered their beds, and the firm
garments from the fleece of their sheep, in which
they fearlessly braved the cold of winter.
But my delight was especially in the spinningroom. There the wheels turned swiftly with merry
music. The step of the spinner was light, and her
face cheerful, as she drew even threads from the.

stockings for the father and brothers.
Masses of yarn, assorted according to its various

texture and destination, hung upon the wall. Each
one was pleased to add to the store, her new skeins.
The flying reel told audibly the amount of every
spindle, and pronounced when the useful task of the
day was done. This seemed to me the kind of industry, which more than any other promoted cheerfulness and health.
The daughters of the family had blooming and
happy countenances. They used their strength
freely in domestic toils, and when they went out
to any distance, rode well and fearlessly on horseback. They seemed never to have any nervous
complaints, or to need a physician. Exercise, and
the healthful food on which they fed, and their own
happy spirits, were their medicines.
The mother superintended all that concerned
them, with a serious dignity. She taught them
every necessary employment, by first taking part in
it herself, and then deputing it to them. She induced them to consider the interests of their father
as their own, and instructed them by her own example how to lessenl his expenses.
She sent to market, in the best order, the surplus
of her dairy, and poultry-yard, and loom. It was
her ambition, that the finer parts of the wardrobe of
herself and family, should be thus procured. It
pleased her better, than to make demands upon the
purse of her husband.
Her eldest daughters desired to have some money
of their own, to purchase such books as they liked,
and to assist the poor. She encouraged their design,
and gave them a room in which to rear the silk82THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
worm. There they were seen busily tending that
curious insect, whose changes from the little egg
like a mustard-seed, to the cell of silken tapestry
where it gathers up its feet to die, shew the wonderful hand of that Being, who is "excellent in
working."
Their small skeins of silk, tastefully arranged for
sale, imitated the colours of the rainbow, and they
were delighted to find, how soon the wand of industry could convert the mulberry leaf to silk, and the
silk to gold. They also aided their younger brothers in a pursuit which interested them-the care of
bees.
Rows of hives were ranged in a sunny and genial
spot. Beds of flowers, and firagrant herbs, were
planted to accommodate the winged chymists. The
purest honey gave variety to their table, and the
superflux, with the wax that was made from the
comb, were among the most saleable articles of
their domestic manufacture.
The long winter evenings in the farmer's house
were delightful. More healthy and happy faces I
have never seen. Yet there was perfect order. For
the parents, who commanded respect, were always
seated among the children. And in the corner, in
the warmest place, was the silver-haired grandmother, with her clean cap, who was counted as an
oracle.
The father, or his sons, read aloud such works as
mingle entertainment with instruction. The females
listened with interest, or made remarks with animation, though their busy hands directed the flight of

the needle, or made the stocking grow. The quiet
hum of the flax-wheel, was held no interruption to
the scene, or to the voice of the reader.
The neighbour coming in, was greeted with a
cordial welcome, and a simple hospitality. Rows
of ruddy apples, roasted before the fire, and various
nuts from their own forest-trees, were an appropriate treat for the social winter-evening, where heart
opened to heart.
Sometimes, the smaller children clustered around
the grandmother's chair, begging her for a story.
She told them of the days when she was young like
them, and of the changes that her life had known.
Especially, she loved to tell of the lessons of her
parents, and of the obedience with which she regarded thenm.
" They taught me," said she, " to work, and not tobe ashamed of industry. I had a companion, about
my own age, who once spent a few months at a city
boarding-school. When she came home, it was observed that she was ashamed to be seen doing the
same useful things, by which the family were supported.
"Her mother directed her to- go and milk the
favourite cow, which she had so long been accustomed to do before she went to school, that it was
called her own. While she was doing it, a neighbour came into the barn yxrd, and she was so much
afraid of being seen, that she hid her head under
the cow, till she was almost smothered.
"Whenever my mother thought I was not pleased
with humble occupations, or plain clothing, she
84THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
would say, C child, don't hide your head under the
cow.' And this made me so much ashamed, that I
willingly did whatever she thought best. And niow
children, never be ashamed of honest industry, for
it is mere foolish than to hide your heads under a
cow, in a warm day."
Thus, by simple stories would she instruct them
in the various duties of life. Especially would she
warn them to fear God, and keep his commandments. At the stated hour of retiring, a sweet and
solemn hymn, in which every voice joined, gave
praise to the Almighty Preserver.
Then the great Bible, taken from the place where
it was carefully kept, was laid before the father of
the family. He reverently read a portion from its
sacred pages, and then in prayer committed his beloved household to the care of Him who never slumbers.
During my visit to this well regulated family, I
was often led to reflect on the peculiar advantages
of a farmer's lot. He is the possessor of true independence. Sheltered from those risks and reverses,
which in crowded cities await those who make haste
to be rich, he feels that patient industry will ensure
a competent support for himself and family.
His children are a part of his wealth. They are
a capital, whose value increases every year that
they remain with him. If he incurs misfortune,
they join and help him out, instead of hanging round
his neck like millstones, to sink him into deeper
waters.
The habits which prevail in his family, the do8

mestic industry, the love of home, the order and
simplicity cherished there from ancient times, promote,the true excellence of the female character.
Many of our most illustrious men have been the
sons of farmers, and traced the elements of their
distinction, to the hardihood and discipline of agricultural nurture.
During my visit to this happy family, when I
looked round upon the healthful faces of its growing
members, their patient diligence, their moderated
desires, their cheerful subordination to their parents,
and saw those parents, not wasting their strength
in the idle ceremonies of fashionable life, but true
hearted and hospitable, independent and pious--I
said, this is the true order of nobility for a republic,
and if the virtue that upholds it should fly from the
pomp of cities, she will be found sheltered in safety
and honour, amid the farm-houses of our land.TIHE GIRL o R-EADING-BCOK.
LETTER TO THE FEMALES OF GREECE.
WHEN Greece was passing through the revolution, by which it gained freedom from the Turkish
yoke, great pity was felt in the United States, for
the sufferings of its inhabitants. Especially was the
sympathy of our females excited, for the miseries
that the war brought upon their own sex.
They were represented in continual terror of
their Turkish oppressors, often forced from their
own homes, scarcely clothed, and wretchedly feeding, with their children, upon the snails and meagre
herbage of the barren mountains whither they were
driven.
The letters of Dr. Howe, now the Principal of the
Institution for the Blind, in Boston, powerfully described their sorrows and their patience. His residence in Greece had rendered him familiar with
the evils which he related, and his appeal to the
bounty of his native land was not in vain.
Vessels were freighted with provisions and clothing, and trusty agents sent out to distribute them.
Not only in the larger cities, but in the villages of
our country, the spirit of benevolence was awake
and active. The cry of Greece seemed to enter into
every ear.
Donations were given. Contributions were gathered. Ladies formed societies, and consulted how
the money thus collected, might be best disposed of
for the benefit of Greece. Even the poor believed
87THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
that they had a garment to spare, and brought it
with tears, for the poorer women of Greece.
Cloth was purchased, and garments cut out, for
those of every age, from the infant, to the hoaryheaded. The little girls from the schools, forgot to
play on their holidays, and sat down to work for
the children of Greece.
Ladies of the greatest wealth,plied their needles
industriously, that the unfortunate Greeks might be
clothed. Their servants also came, offering a part
of their wages, They sat down by their side, working for the same charity.
It was like one great sisterhood, in which narrow
distinctions were forgotten. Such was the spirit of
harmony breathed into every heart, it would seem
that we were debtors to the Greeks, and not they to
us. It was the happiness of benevolence. There
is no other like it.
The little ones'partook of it, and their smile was
brighter, while they learned the luxury of doing
good. Their voices were tender and sweet, as they
said to each other,;" Greece hungered, and we gave
her food; she was naked, and we clothed her."
In one of the cities of New England, when the
boxes of apparel, and the barrels of provisions,
were ready to be sent, it was suggested that a letter.should accompany them. One was accordingly
written, and translated into modern Greek.
It was received and read by those de,solate women, with the weeping of joy. And it affords a
lesson to those who have nothing else to give, that

to the afflicted heart. EHere is a copy of the letter
to the females of Greece.
" Hartford, Conn.) March 12th, 1828.
SISTERS AND FRIENDS,
From our years of childhood, the land of
your birth has been the theme of our admiration.
With our brothers and husbands, we early learned
to love the country of Homer and of Solon, of Aristides and Herodotus, of Socrates and of Plato.
That enthusiasm which the glory of ancient
Greece enkindled in our bosoms, has kept alive a
fervent friendship for her children. We have seen
with deep sympathy the horrors of Turkish domination, and the struggle so long and nobly sustained, for existence and for liberty.
The communications of Dr. Howe, since his return from your afflicted clime, have made us more
intimately acquainted with your personal sufferings.
His vivid descriptions have presented you to us,
seeking refuge in caves, and dens of the earth,
listening in terror for the footsteps of the destroyer, or mourning over your dearest ones slain
in battle.
Sisters and friends, our hearts bleed for you. Deprived of parents and protectors by the fortune of
war, and continually in fear of evils worse than
death, our prayers are with you, in all your wanderings, your wants, and your woes.
In this vessel, (which may God send in saf'to
your shores,) you will receive a portion of that
bounty with which he hath blessed us. The poor

Look at the man who can neither read nor write.
How confused are his ideas! How narrow his conceptions! How fixed his prejudices! How dependent is he on others to convey his sentiments, and to
interpret their own! How liable to mistakes! How
incapable of forming just and liberal opinions!
Ignorance has been truly called the mnother of
error. When Galileo first taught the true motion of
the earth round the sun, he was treated as a criminal,
and thrown into a dungeon. When Columnbus revealed
his plan of searching for another continent, he was
thre;tened with imprisonment.
When Captain Smith was taken by the North
American Indians, and sent a letter to his distant
friends, the chiefs met to consult about the mystery
of this "speaking leaf," and thought that the man
who wrote it was a magician, and must be punished.
If defects in intellectual education lead to such
evils,-defects in the education of the heart are still
more deplorable. Look at the child whose moral
principles have been neglected. Has he a regard
for truth? Does he shrink at dishonesty? Is his
conscience quick to warn him of a wrong motive?
Does he obey his parents? Does he love his teachers? Is he anxious to understand and keep the law
of God?
A good education is another name for happiness.
We all desire to be happy, and should be willing to
take pains to learn how. iEe who wishes to acquire
a trade or a profession,--to build a house, or to cultivate a farm, or to guide a vessel over the sea, must exp,ect to work as an apprentice, or to study as a scholar..9THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
among us have contributed, according to their
abilities. Our children have added their gifts and
their industry, that your children might have bread
to eat, and raiment to put on.
Could you but have seen the faces of our little
ones brighten, and their eyes sparkle with joy, as
they gave up their holiday sports, that they might
work with their needles for Greece,-could you
have beheld those females who earn a subsistence
by labour, gladly casting a mite into your treasury,
or taking hours from their repose, that you might
have an additional garment,-could you have witnessed the active benevolence inspiring every class
of our community,-it would cheer for a molllent
the darkness and misery of your lot.
Inhabitants, as we are, of a part of one of the
smallest of the United States, our donations must of
necessity be more limited than those from the
larger and more wealthy cities. But such as we
have, we give in the name of the dear Saviour, with
our blessings and our prayers.
We know the value of sympathy, how it girds the
heart.to bear, how it plucks the sting from sorrow.
Therefore we have written these few lines to assure
you, that in the remote parts of our country, as well
as in her high places, you are remembered with pity
and with love.
Sisters and friends,-we extend across the ocean,
our hands to you, in the fellowship of Christ. We
pray that his cross, and the banner of your land,
may together rise above the crescent and the
minaret,-that yout sons may hail the freedom of

HOPE AND MIIEMORY.
A BABE lay in its cradle. A being with bright
hair, and a clear eye, came and kissed it. Her name
was Hope. Its nurse denied it a cake, for which it
cried; but Hope told it of one in store for it to-morrow. Its little sister gave it a flower, at which it
clapped its hands joyfully, and Hope promised it
fairer ones, which it should gather for itself.
The babe grew to a boy. He was musing at the
summer twilight.'Another being, with a sweet, serious face, came and sat by him. Her name was
Memory. And she said, "Look behind thee, and
tell me what thou seest."
The boy answered, " I see a short path, bordered
with flowers.  Butterflies spread out gay wings
there, and birds sing among the shrubs. It seems
to be the path where my feet have walked, for at
the beginning of it is my own cradle."
"What art thou holding in thy hand?" asked Memory. And he answered, " a book which my mother gave me." " Come hither," said Memory, with
a gentle voice, " and I will teach thee how to get honey out of it, that shall be sweet, when thy hair is
gray."
The boy became a youth. Once, as he lay in his
bed, Hope and Memory came to the pillow. Hope
sang a merry song, like the ]ark when she rises from
the nest to the skies. Afterwards, she said, "Follow me, and thou shalt have music in thy heart, as
sweet as the lay I sung thee.'
92THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.     93
But Memory said, " He shall be mine also. Hope,
why need we contend? For as long as he keepeth
Virtue in his heart, we will be to him as sisters, all
his life long." So, he embraced Hope and Memory,
and was beloved of them both.
VWhen he awoke, they blessed him, and he gave a
hand to each. He became a man, and Hope girded
him every morning for his labour, and every night
he supped at the table of Memory, with Knowledge
for their guest.
At length, age found the man, and turned his temples white. To his dim eye, it seemed that the
world was an altered place. But it was he himself who had changed, and the warm blood had
grown cold in his veins.
Memory looked on him with grave and tender
eyes, like a loving and long-tried friend. She sat
down by his elbow-chair, and he said to her, " Thou
hast not kept faithfully some jewels that I entrusted to thee. I fear that they are lost."
She answered mournfully and meekly, "It may
be so. The lock of my casket is worn. Sometimes
I am weary, and fall asleep. Then Time purloins
my key. But the gems that thou gavest me when
life was new, see! I have lost none of them. They
are as brilliant as when they first came into my
hands."
Memory looked pitifully on him, as she ceased to
speak, wishing to be forgiven. But Hope began to
unfold a radiant wing which she had long worn concealed beneath her robe, and daily tried its strength
in a heavenward flight.94          THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
The old man lay down to die. And as the soul
went forth from the body, the angels took it. Memory ascended by its side, and went through the
open gate of heaven. But Hope paused at the
threshold. There she expired, like a rose faintly
giving forth its last odours.
A glorious form bent over her. Her name was
Immortal Happiness. Hope commended to her the
soul, which she had followed through the world.' Religion," she said, "planted in it such seeds as
bear the fruit of heaven. It is thine forever."
tier, dying words were like the music of some
breaking harp, mournful but sweet. And I heard
the voices of angels saying, " Hope that is born of
the earth must die, but Memory is eternal, as the
books from which men are judged."THE GIRL7S READING-BOOK.
THE SLEEPLESS LABOURERS.
THOSE who conduct important trades, or laborious
manufactories, prefer such assistants as possess bodily vigour, and can endure fatigue. Some occupations, it is necessary to continue during a part of the
night. Yet even the strongest labourers cannot long
bear this system, unless they take additional sleep
during the day. Did you ever hear of labourers
who never slept? And yet there are two such.
They labour for you.
Say you, that you have never seen such labourers? Yet they propel the most curious machinery
for your benefit. Listen! can you not hear them at
their work? Their workshop is within you. Look,
and see what there is about you, that does not need
repose. The hands are obliged to rest from their toil.
The limbs stretch themselves out, and relax their
wearied muscles. The strained eye closes upon its'tasks. The ear shuts up its labyrinth.
The thinking brain retires within its curtained
cells. The tongue ceases to do the bidding of the
soul. The head seeks its pillow, and the strong man
lies as powerless as the nursing-babe. But these
two sleepless labourers remit not their toil. They
complain of no weariness. They accept of no relaxation. They stand upon the wall of life, senti,
nels who never put off their armour, watchmen who
are never relieved.
Other labourers require supervision. The merchant holds his clerk accountable, and the master
955THE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.
his servant. The head manufacturer has an eye to
his machinery, the farmer goes to the field with his
men, the teacher is watchful that his rules may be
brought to bear upon his scholars. The hand depends for its dictates upon the ruling mind; the foot,
like an errand-boy, waits its orders where to go; the
eye and the ear gather into its garners.
The sleepless labourers trouble the mind for no
directions. They require not to be told what their
work is, or to be questioned whether they have done
it. It is the custom to reward with increased wages,
those servants who perform severe labour, and to
give high salaries to such agents as fill difficult and
responsible stations. What payment is accorded to
these labourers, who wake and work while we sleep,
without whose aid we are not able to draw a single
breath?
I grieve to say, that the fashion of our sex has dealt
hardly by them. She seems not to have appreciated
their services. She impedes them in their mysterious toil. She binds them with tight ligatures, so
that they do their work in pain. Sometimes they
even faint and sicken at her cruelty. You will, ere
this, have discovered that the indefatigable servants
of whom we have spoken, are the Heart and Lungs.
I think I hear you say, with an honest warmth,
that these sleepless labourers shall be better treated;
that the lungs, which blow the bellows of life, and
the heart, which feeds it with fuel, till the ice of
death comes, shall not be painfuilly compressed by
the busk, or fettered by the corset. It is undoubtedly possible to hold yourselves erect, without bring96THIE GIRL'S READING-BOOK.     97
ing hurtful engines to bear upon the seat of vitality.
Would it not be a noble resolution to undertake to
do so?
We shudder, when we think how frequently the
slightest illjury to the lungs proves fatal; how soon
death enters, when their most delicate air-valves are
broken. We think with wonder of the force with
which the heart operates, sending continually the
whole mass of blood to the smallest veins, and the
most remote arteries, working at the rate of one
hundred thousand strokes every twenty-four hours,
and continuing this sleepless labour, sometimes for
eighty or ninety years, without wearing out. Shall
ve dare to embarrass these agents of Almighty
power?
The slightest ligatures are capable of troubling
these faithful labourers. How dangerous then must
be the tight-lacing which is sometimes so rashly hazarded. Not the lungs and heart alone are thus injured. The stomach is oppressed in its important
task of digestion, the brain clouded by obstructed
circulation, and irregular transmission of blood, and
the spine perverted from its great purpose of giving
stability to the frame.
We counted the Turks as barbarians, when they
broke down the sculptured columns of the Greeks,
and destroyed those works of art, which for ages
had been admired. What shall they be called, who
deface the architecture of their Maker? If he has
placed in the recesses of this clay-temple, servants
to whom he has committed a wonderful work for
our benefit, if he has commanded them to labour
9THE GIRLrS READING-BOOK.
without sleep, without wages, without troubling
us for orders, and to be as symbols of his own untiring care,-shall we arrest their progress? tie them
up at their posts? compel them to toil in pain? do
all in our power to frustrate their fidelity and his benevolence?
We will not do this, though it be the fashion.
These sleepless labourers shall not be incommoded
by us. The Giver of our breath shall not thus be
mocked. The blood which he has poured into our
veins, shall flow freely in the channels which he
hath ordained. It shall not be forced by our rashness, to burst its flood-gates, or to be imprisoned in
its citadel, or to stir up the brain to mutiny and
madness.
We will not, though others do it, obstruct the free
action of the lungs, or press upon the heart, in its
mysterious laboratory. We dare not interrupt the
intricate and exquisite machinery of God.. We are
afraid to do so, lest He who is the former of our bodies, the father of our spirits, should make his abused
goodness the instrument of our punishment, and bid
the ill-treated organs take vengeance on us, and
the Sleepless Labourers become our foes, and shorten the life they were at first appointed to guard.

SUNDAY-SALT.
THE uses of salt are various. You all know that
it improves the taste of food, that it helps to preserve
meat from putrefaction, and is favourable to health.
It is also used in the fusion of metals, in the manufacture of glass, and sometimes to quicken the fertility of cold and barren soils.
It is agreeable to domestic animals. It is especially salutary to those that feed on grass. The carefil farmer gives it statedly to his flocks and herds.
It is pleasing to see the sheep and the cows, the
oxen and horses, each eagerly receiving their portion
of what seems the dessert to their simple meal.
Wild animals discover where the earth is impregnated with salt. There they gather in throngs, to
taste the luxury. In our Western States, there are
multitudes of such spots, which are called licks.
Thither also the hunters repair, and lie in wait for
their prey.
In eastern countries, lions imitate this cunning of
the hunters. Fountains are there scarce, and they
make their dens in. marshy places, to seize the animals who resort thither to drink. This was so often
the case in Palestine, that some of the Hebrlew poets
called the lion, the " wild beast of the reeds."
There, like the hunter at the salt-licks, he lay
crouched in his lair, and when the " hart came panting for the water-brooks," or other feeble animals
hasted to quench their thirst, he was ready to devour
them.
