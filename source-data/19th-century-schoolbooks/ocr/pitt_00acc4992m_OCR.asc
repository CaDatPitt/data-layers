tenth century books were so scarce in Spain, that
the same volumes used to serve for several monasteries. And a single copy of the Bible, and
a few other books, not more than sixteen, were so
important a legacy, that it was witnessed by the
king, queen, and several bishops. Prayers used
to be said, after the manner of that ignorant age, for
the souls of such as had given books to a monastery. These books were most carefully kept, and
when, as a great favour, they were lent, it was
regularly certified in a legal writing.
Ernest. But did books continue to be so dear,
even in England?
Uncle. Even after the Reformation began to
dawn, books were scarce. Wiclif's Translation
of the New Testameni cost more than a poor man
could pay. In 1424, a Mass Book was sold for
five marks, (23 6s. 8d.,) or nearly fifteen dollars,
equal to the salary of a curate for a year. When
printing was invented, nothing used to surprise the
people so much as that a Bible could be bought for
forty crowns. In 1521, when many poor people in
Lincolnshire were burned by the papists, I read that
one John Collins paid for a printed Bible twenty
shillings, or less than five dollars; being then as
much as the wages of a master carpenter for forty
days, or the price of four hundred and eighty
pounds of beef.
98TO THE SCRIPTURES.
As I said before, you sed how thankful we ought
to be that we live at a time, and in a country,
where every one can have the sacred Scriptures,
and especially that we can have them translated
into our own language.
Ernest. I should like to hear something about
the translations of the Bible.
Uncle. The earliest translation of which we
have any certain account, is what is called the Septuagint. It is so called because it was made by
about seventy Jews, and septuaginta is the Latin
for seventy. It was in Greek, and was made by
order of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt,
who was a great collector of books. This was
made about two hundred and fifty years before
Christ. It was this version which was used by the
early Christians.
Hilary. Was not the Bible translated into
Latin?
Uncle. It was; several times. The only Latin
version, however, which I think necessary to mention, is the Vulgate, which is considered the standard by the Romish church. The word vulgate
means common. It was made towards the close
of the fourth century, by Jerome, a celebrated
father of the church.
Ernest. Was the Bible translated into many
other languages?
99AN INTRODUCTION.
Uncle. Yes, it was natural for this to happen.
Whenever Christianity came into a new country,
the people would wish to have the Bible in their
mother toigue. The wicked and impious practice
of withholding the Scriptures from the people had
noi yet begun.  Pious missionaries laboured to
multiply translations, and many of these are still in
existence.
Hilary. Were there any translations into English?
Uncle. You must know that the English language is formed out of one called the d.ngloSaxon, or Saxon, which was spoken in England
some centuries ago. The first translation of which
I have read was by ldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne,
about the year 706. He translated the Psalms into
Saxon. The four gospels were translated by Egbert, another bishop, who died A. D. 721. The
whole Bible was translated by the venerable Bede,
a few years after. About two hundred years later,
King llfred made a new translation of the Psalms.
And Elfric, Archbishop of Canterbury, about A. D.
995, translated a large portion of the Bible.
Ernest. You say these were Saxon; but when
was the first Enzglish translation made?
Uncle. About A. D. 1290, by an unknown author.
Towards the end of the fourteenth century, that is
about 1380, the great JOIN WICLIF, who is some100TO THE SCRIPTURES.         101
times called the " Morning-star of the Reformation," translated the whole New Testament into
English. This was very offensive to the papists,
and some persons endeavoured to get it suppressed
by the parliament, but without success. But for
a long time afterwards, many thousands were persecuted and slain for reading this book.
Hilary. Was the English of those people the
same which we speak now?
Uncle. Let me give you a specimen. I will
let you read several verses out of Wticlif's New
Testament, which I have here:.UoWb n1m soulre s troubhltb, anub mhuat

Hilary. O, I cap scarcely understand a word of it.
Ernest. When was the first English Bible
printed?
Uncle. The first Bible printed was the translation by ftilliam  Tindal.  He went to Antwerp
in Flanders, and there finished his translation of
the whole Bible. He was assisted by John Fry,
or Fryth, and William Joy; the former of whom
was burned at the stake by the papists in 1533, and
the latter suffered in the same way in Portugal.
The first edition of the New Testament was bought
up by the popish bishop of London, and burned.
But with the money paid for this, others were
printed. Those who were suspected of importingTO THE SCRIPTURES.          103
these books into England, were condemned, by Sit
Thomas More, to ride with their faces to the tails
of their horses, and to throw the books publicly
into a fire. Many thousands were, however, circulated. Multitudes learned to read. Many used to
travel far, and sit up all night in barns or sheds,
hearing the k-,wd read, and thus committing it to
nemory. Tihdal himself suffered martyrdom  in
1536, near Brussels, having been seized by order
of King Henry VIII. He died praying, " Lord,
open the King of England's eyes."
Ernest. You have given us a specimen of Wiclif's translation: will you please to give us a
specimen of Tindal's?
Uncle. With pleasure. You must remember
that, in that day, books were printed in what is
called Black Letter or Old English.  Here it is.

This was an excellent translation. In many
parts of it, Tindal was helped by Miles Coverdale
The whole Bible, when it was published in 1535,
was dedicated to the pious young King Edward VI.,
who was a friend to the Reformation. It was the
first English Bible issued by royal authority. It
was ordered that one of them should be in every
church. John Rogers, the first martyr in Queen
Mary's reign, was apprehended for having been
concerned in this publication.
Hilary. I dare say the good Protestants were
glad to have this book.
Uncle. They were so, indeed, as you will see
by an anecdote which I will tell you.*
It was wonderful, says a historian, to see with
what joy this book was received, not only among
the more learned sort, but all over England, among
all the common people.   Everybody who was
able bought the book, or busily read it, or got
others to read it aloud.  Many elderly people
Strype, Mem. I. b. i c. 17.TO TIIE SCRIPTURES.
learned to read on purpose. Even little boys
flocked among the rest to hear portions read.
There was a lad nalned W1;illiam ilal(don who
lived at Chelinsford, in Essex. Several poor men
of this town bought the New Testanient, and on
Sundays they used to sit and read it at the lower
end of the chureh. Many people used to collect
to hear, and among the rest, William, who was
then fifteen years old. His father took notice of
this, and one day came in a passion, and took him
away, to say his Latin prayers. Trhis grieved him
very nluch. As often as he used to return to hear
the reading, his father used to take him away.
This made him desire to learn to read for himself;
and he succeeded. He and an apprentice of his
father's laid their money together, and bought a
New Testament. They hid it under the bed-straw.
One night, while his father was asleep, he and his
mother were talking about worshipping the crucifix,
and William said it was idolatry. His mother infiormed upon him, and his father flew into a rage,
arose from his bed, pulled William by the hair of
his head, and whipped him unmercifully. Many
years after, William told good Mr. Fox, that he:tore this beating without a tear, and even with joy,
because it was for Christ's sake. This enraged
his father still more, so that he ran down and
brought a halter, and put it round his neck, threat105AN INTRODUCTION
ening to hang him. At length, by his mother's entreaties, the cruel father ceased, leaving him almost
dead. There are many such anecdotes in a book
called "Fox's Acts and Monuments."    I could
tell you of several other translations and editions,
but none of them are so important as the Bishops'
Bible.
Ernest. When was this printed?
Uncle. In 1568. It was proposed by Archbishop Parker, and by authority of the crown.
He divided the whole Bible into fifteen portions,
and gave these to fifteen learned men, for each of
them to translate his part. It was furnished with
maps, plates, and some notes.
Ernest. Why was it called the Bishops' Bible?
Uncle. Because eight of the fifteen learned men
who translated it were bishops. In 1571, it was
ordered that one of these should be in every church.
Hilary. If there were as many translations of
the Bible in other countries as there were in England, they would make a large library of themselves.
Uncle. Some persons have endeavoured to
make such a collection. In 1768, Charles, Duke
of Wurtemburg, began a great library, and among
other things, he collected all the different editions
of the Bible he could find, in every language. The
whole number of Bibles, in 1804, was nine thou106TO THE SCRIPTURES.            107
sand, and he still wanted three thousand more to
complete the collection.
But, my dear boys, I must not keep you here
any longer, for it is time that you were at your
exercises out of doors. To-morrow I am to give

now use.CONTENTS.

I HAVE said that uncle Austin had a great collection of valuable books. Among them, there were
several ancient English Bibles.   One of these, a
folio volume, lay upon his table when the boys
entered for their morning entertainment. As the
old gentleman saw his nephews coming, he laid his
finger on the book, and said:
"Here, my boys, is the best translation ever
made of the Bible."
Hilary. Which is that, dear uncle?
Uncle. It is oar common English Bible, but it
goes by various names. Sometimes it is called
simply, The English Version, because it is the
latest and best of the Bibles in our language.
Sometimes it is called The authorized Version,
because it was published by the authority of the
government, and because the use of it is en108TO THE SCRIPTURES.
joined by many churches.     Sometimes it is
called King  James's Version, because it was
made by his order. We may also call it the Common Version or Translation. And whatever we
call it, we must acknowledge that it is one of the
greatest blessings which God has ever conferred
on any land or nation.
Ernest. It seems to me, uncle, as if it was given
to a great many lands and nations.
Hilary. How so, Ernest?
Ernest. Because it is in English, and English,
is spoken in many different countries.
Uncle. You are right, Ernest, and your expression is more just than mine. The English
Version is a gift of God to many millions. If none
were to read it but the inhabitants of the single
island of Great Britain,, it would be a great thing;
for there are, in that island alone, more than sixteen
millions of souls. Then there are more than seven
millions in Ireland. So you see there are more
than twenty-four millions of people in these two
islands; and among all of these the Bible may be
carried, but we must add many more.
Ernest. Yes, because here in America we all
talk English.
Hilary. Not all, for there are a good many
Germans, and Frenchmen, and Spaniards.
Uncle. Ernest's remark is true in the general.
10
109AN INTRODUCTION
In the United States, there is not one in a thousand
who does not understand English. Now what is
the population of the United States?
Ernest and Hilary. More than twelve millions.
Uncle. Then you must add, all the people in the
East and West Indies who speak English, and all
those in British America, and the south of Africa,
Every day we live, our language is gaining ground
in the world, and it seems plain that Providence
has ordered this to be so, that the saving knowledge which abounds in English books might be
spread all over the world. But now for the book
itself. Look here, and read this title-page.
Ernest. The spelling looks old-fashioned, but
I believe I can read it.
" The Holy Bible, conteyning the Old Testament and the New, newly translated out of the
Originall Tongues, and with the former Translations diligently compared and revised by his
Mcjaeties  specicl Coinandment.  Imnprinted at
London, by Robert Barker, Printer to the King's
most excellent Ma,jestie. 1611."
Hilary. Pray wlhat is that mark over the m in
the word commandment?
tUicle. I think you might guess; it is to make
up for one of the m's which is left out. It was
used by the old scriveners to save room, and is very
common in ancient Latin books.
11oTO THE SCRIPTURES.
Hilary. What is meant by the King's most
excellent majesty?
Uncle. It is a common term in monarchies for
the monarch himself: here it means King James I.
What do you know about him?
Ernest. He was the first of the house of Stuart
that reigned in England. The Scottish and English crowns were united in him. He came to the
English throne in 1603, and died in 1625. He
was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots.
Hilary. James I. was a weak man, but had a
great deal of knowledge. He was always trying
to show his learning. He was also disposed to be
a tyrant.  We have learned a great deal more
about him at school.
Uncle. That is sufficient. You may now see the
advantage of knowing a little history. What you
say of James is true; yet, after all, he did some
very good things; and the best of these was the
version before your eyes.
Ernest. 1But, sir, did the king make it himself?
Uncle. Not exactly, but he caused it to be done.
And I am now about to tell you the way in which
this came about.   When James ascended the
throne, he found there were great disputes and differences among his new  subjects about church
government and doctrines. Most of the people
were fond of episcopacy, but some who were
111AN INTRODUCTION
called Puritans, were opposed to it  These Puritans begged the king to allow a conference, or
meeting, at which the chief men of the two sides
night argue the matter in a friendly way. He
consented to this, and appointed a conference,
which took place at Hampton Court, in 1604.
The king presided as moderator. Dr. John Raynolds, or Reynolds, was the chief speaker of the
Puritans, and petitioned for a new translation of the
Bible. He gave some instances to show that the
previous translations were faulty.
Ernest. What did the king say to this?
Uncle. He agreed that there ought to be a new
version, made by the most learned men, which
should be used by every one: because there was
great confusion arising from the variety of Bibles
in use. And accordingly, in 1604, he appointed
fifty-four learned men, and commanded them to set
about the work of making a new translation.
Ernest. Did they all come together to do it?
Uncle. No. Indeed only forty-seven actually
went through with the work. The other seven
either declined the task, or were removed by
death. These forty-seven were distributed among
three cities, Westminster, Oxford, and Cam.
bridge.
Ernest. Is Westminster a city?
Uncle. It is; though it is now considered as
112TO THE SCRIPTURES.
a part of London. Talien together with Southwark, they make up the great metropolis of Great
Britain. You know that the other two cities are
those in which the two famous universities are. It
was very natural to suppose that the greatest number of learned men would be in these three places.
But I was about to answer Ernest's question, thus:
The translators were divided into six sets or classes.
These sets were called companies.
Ernest. That makes just two for each of the
three places.
Uncle. It does. There were two companies at
Westminster, two at Cambridge, and two at Oxford. Of the translators, seventeen were at Westminster, fifteen at Cambridge, and fifteen at Oxford.
Each company worked by itself, and each had a
particular part of the work assigned to it. You
must remember that they included the apocryphal
books.
Ernest. I should like to understand how they
managed this difficult business.
Uncle. I will try to make it clear to you. Remember there were six companies, and in each
company seven or eight individuals. Now let us
take a single company, andl see how it proceeded.
We will say, for example, the first of the Oxford
companies. This contained seven individuals. l'o
this company were assigned the major and minor
10*
113AN INTRODUCTION
prophets. Now each of these seven persons stu
died his portion at home by himself. TI'hen hc
wrote the best translation he could of certain chapters agreed upon. Then, on a certain day, all the
seven met together, each one bringing the translation he had made. Here they compared their versions, discussed difficulties, and talked the matter
over, until they had agreed on some translation.
When they had got through with all the prophets,
they had their work transcribed, and sent a copy
to each of the other five companies.
Ernest. But what if their translation did not
please the other companies?
Uncle. This must have happened frequently,
and provision was made by the king for such disagreement. As soon as a version was brought to
a company for examination, all the members met.
One read the new translation, and each of the
others held in his hand some Bible, in Hebrew,
Greek, French, Italian, &amp;c. If no one said any
thing, the translation was accepted. But when any
one was dissatisfied, he spoke out and mentioned
it. If the company thought the translation wrong,
they marked the error, and sent back an account of
it to. those who had made the version. And it was
changed or not, according to the final judgment of
the whole.
114TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Hilary. Was there ever ally general meeting of
the whole forty-seven?
Uncle. I am unable to discover whether all of
them ever convened. The king's rule however
was, that differences were to be settled "at the
general meeting, which is to be of the chief persons of each company, at the end of the work."There was another rule, that in very difficult
(questions, they might get the help of any other
learned men. And every bishop in England was
commanded to inform all his clergy that the Bible
was translating, and to request the use of such
critical notes as any of them might have made.
Ernest. Surely the version ought to be good,
for I cannot think how a better method could have
been used.
Uncle. The plan was wise, and the result is
blessed.
Ernest. I have heard people say that our translation was made in an ignorant age.
Uncle. If they meant that it was made by ignorant men, they spoke either falsely or ignorantly.
I suppose there were never united in any one literary labour, an equal number of men, possessing all
equal amount of learning. True, there are some

11'51AN INTRODUCTION
things better understood in our day, but there were
also scholars in that day far superior to most now
living.* Thirteen of the number were heads (or
presidents) of colleges. Six were bishops. Among
these was Abbot, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. A number of them were selected for their wonderful knowledge of the oriental languages. One of
them, Dr. Layfield, was chosen on account of his
great skill in architecture, and his judgment was
much relied upon in what relates to the tabernacle
and temple. Master Edward Lively, as he was
called, was the greatest orientalist among them, but
he died before the work was done.
Ernest. How long did it take them to make this
version?
Uncle. It was begun in 1607, and it was completed in 1610. It took them, therefore, almost
three years. When the whole was finished, three
copies were sent to London; that is, one copy from
each of the three cities.
Hil(ry. Then, I suppose, the king had it printed
immediately.
Uncle. Not immediately. His plan was too
wise to allow him to hurry matters. Six men
were appointed to revise the whole, two from the

joint-company of each city. They met daily in
the Stationers' Hall, London. They finished their
part of the work in nine months. And to conclude,
the whole was finally revised by Dr. Smith, afterwards Bishop of Gloucester. It is he who wrote
the preface found in the old editions.*
Ernest. I cannot help feeling a great respect for
this old volume. According to what you say, this
was printed the very year after the work was done.
Uncle. It was. There are copies which have

lilcary. It must have been received with great
joy by all the pious people in England.
Uncle. It was indeed a joyful day; yet not so
much so as when the other translations appeared;
for the people had several versions already, especially the Bishops' Bible. And whatever faults
there may have been in these, they were, in the
main, correct. You have heard it said, with truth,
that the very worst translation contains enough to
save the soul.
The Bishops' Bible was a great blessing. It
ought not to be forgotten. The work of these
great translators would have been immensely more

10AN INTRODUCTION
James laid down for them, was, that the Bishops'
Bible was to be followed, and altered as little as
the original would permit. This is the reason
why many of the proper names are strangely written.
Hilary. My mother has a Prayer Book, such
as is used in the church of England; and the
Psalms of David in it are very different from
what they are in our Bibles.
Uncle. True. When our authorized version
was published, the Prayer Book had been already
compiled.  The Psalms, and the Epistles and
Gospels in the Common Prayer were from old
versions. The Epistles and Gospels were from the
Bishops' Bible; but in 1661, they were exchanged
for the new version. But the Psalms were according to the translation of Cranmer's Bible, and so
they remain to this day. But however the translators may have been indebted to those who preceded them, they have laid the church of Christ
under a special obligation. As old Fuller says:
" These, with Jacob, rolled away the stone from the
mouth of the well of life; so that now even Rachel's
weak women may freely come, both to drink themselves, and water the flocks of their families at the
same.'"Ernest. I should be obliged to you, uncle, if

you would give me, on a piece of paper, the names
of these translators.
Uncle. With pleasure. The thought is a good
one. You may then find out at your leisure who
they all were. Wait a few minutes, and I will
copy them out of good old Fuller. And you shall
have them in their companies, and the parts which
they translated.

THE day after that in which uncle Austin gave
his account of the English Bible was exceedingly
cold. There had been a great snow during the
night, and the strong wind had blown it into high
banks, so that in many places the fences were entirely covered up.  This made the good old gentleman feel some anxiety about his sheep, lest some
of them should have been buried in the snow-drifts;
a thing which often happens in hard winters.  He
therefore went out, imimediately after breakfast, to
attend to the poor animals, remembering the words of
Scripture,.:3 righteous man regardeth the life of his
beast.*' This employed him for more than an hour,
and during his absence the boys amused themselves
with thle various books and maps which lay upon
his table.  When uncle Austin came in again, he
* Prov. xii. 10.TO THE SCRIPTURES.
hk at O',6ts. and Hilary engaged in a little debate
a} )ut d  me,maning of a word which -they had met
with i tbeir leoading. It was the word lIpocalypse.
Uncle. O, my boys, the word.Ipocalypse is
only another name for the last book in the Bible.
-apocalypse is the Greek for Revelation.
Hilary. Why, sir, have any o1' the books more
than one name?
Uncle. Yes, my son, there are several variations
of this kind. In different languages, of course, the
names differ very miuch: and even in our own language we often eall the same book by two names.
Just turn over the leaves of that large Oxford Bible;
look at the titles of the several books, and I think
you will discover what I mean.
Ernest. Yes. I think I have already found a
place of the sort you mean. Thle First Book of
Samuel, otherwise calledl Tle First Book of the
Kings.
Uncle. Exactly so. You will find the same
thing in the second book of Sanluel. And if yon
look farther, at the beginning of what we commonly
call First Kings, you will see a similar difference.
Ernest. I do. Thle First Book of the k'ings,
commonly called The Third Book of the Kings.
Hilary. Yes; but, uncle, it seems to ine that this
book is not commonly called The Third Book of
the Kings. Do we not commonly say First Sa123.AN INTRODUCTION
m   iuel-Second Samuel-and then First KingsSecond Kings?
Uncle. We do so now-a-days. But two hun(Ired years ago, when our translation was first used,
everybody counted four books of Kings, and this
was the third. I will tell you the reason of this.
You remember I spoke to you of the famous Latin
translation, called the Vulgate.* This was used,
and is to this day used, among Roman Catholics.
After the Reformation, the same names of the books
which people had learned from the Vulgate were
very naturally used; making a little alteration in
the Latin names, so as to change them into
English. In this way we borrow from the Latin
the very names which they borrowed from the,
Greek.
Hilary. I have found another double title-Ec.clesiastes, or the Preacher.
Uncle. Yes, that is a good instance. The Hebrew name of this book of Solomon is KOHELErTH.'rhis word means The Preacher. The Greeks
turned it into Ecclesiastes, which means the same
thing. The Latins borrowed this from the Greek,
and the English borrowed it from the Latin.
Ernest. Are any more of the books known by
two names?
* See p. 99.
124TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Uncle. Yes, the very next book, which is 7'1e
Song of Solomon, is often called the Canticles.
Ernest. Is Canticles also a Greek word?
Uncle. No. It is an English word, derived from
the Latin. In the Vulgate this book is called Carilicum Ccanticorum, or the Song of Songs. Read
the first verse of it in that Bible, and you will find
the very expression. From all this you will see
that the names of the various books have often been
changed. At the present time, the Germans, instead of saying Genesis, Exodus. &amp;c., say First
Book of Moses, Second Book of IIoses, &amp;c. But
I think we have now been long enough upon the
names, for I wish to go to something more interesting.
Ernest. There is one question I should like to
ask before you go any further. Are the books of
Scripture always arranged in the same order?
Uncle. Not exactly. The Hebrew differs from
the Greek. And in our version we chiefly follow
the arrangement of the Septuagint, or Greek translation. In the Hebrew Bible, the books are arranged like ours as far as second Kings. Then come
the whole of the Prophets, except Daniel, and the
remaining books follow in this order: Psalms,
Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles.

125AN INTRODUCTION
I wish uow to speak to you of the divisions of
the Bible.  And let me ask you this question.
Into how many diferent parts or portions is the
Bible divided?  Ernest, lay that large Bible before
you, and give me an answer.
Ernest. That is easily answered. The Bible is
divided into two great portions-the Old Testament
and the New Testament.
Uncle. Very well. Now tell me some smaller
(livision.
Ernest. Each Testament is divided into books.
Uncle. Very well, again. Here we have a second division, into books. Go on.
Ernest. Each book is divided into chapters.
Hilary. Wait a moment, brother. Some of the
little books are not divided into chapters at all.
Uncle. I am pleased to see you on the alert.
There are some books, such as Obadiah, Philemon, second and third epistles of John, and the
epistle of Jtude, which are not broken into chapters. Still it is correct to say in a general way
that each book is divided into chapters. Proceed,
Ernest.
Ernest. Each chapter is divided into verses.
And this is the smallest division of all.
Uncle. True. But you have not observed a
division which comes between the chapters and the
verses.
126TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Ernest. I cannot imagine what that is. I see
no other division.
Hilary. Nor do I.
Uncle. Open your Bible again. Look at the
first chapter of Genesis. After the number which
marks the sixth verse, do you not observe a mark
like an inverted P?
Ernest. 0 yes, sir! That is called a paragraph
Uncle. Very true. And this mark (~) denotes
the beginning of a new paragraph or small section.
These sections are smaller than chapters, and com
monly larger than verses; yet sometimes the para
graph contains only a single verse, as in 1 Sam.
xxiii. 29; unless we reckon this paragraph to end
with verse 8 of the following chapter.
Ernest. What is the meaning of the word?
Uncle. The wordparagraph is from the Greek,
and means "a distinct part of a discourse."  In
common books a paragraph contains a number of
sentences, and the blank space between paragraphs
is much greater than between sentences. Commonly wherever there is a break in a line, it shows
that a new paragraph is begun. But the Bible is
so printed that there is just such a break, or blank
space, between the verses.  And therefore, in
order to show where a new paragraph begins,
this mark (~) is put after the number of the
verse.

Introduction-Account of uncle Austin-The holidays-Visit

him-Walk over the grounds.
ERNEST and Hilary were the sons of Mr. Miller
of New York. They were sensible boys, and had
been taught in the best schools of the city. Ernest
was the elder; but his brother had so much sprightliness, that they were almost always learning the
same things; and they looked very much alike, so
that people sometimes took them for twins.
When the winter came on, and they had been
going very steadily to school, they began to think
of getting free from their books. They were sitting
by a bright coal-fire in the little back-room, one
evening in December, when Hilary shut up his
grammar, and said, "Ernest, it is time to think
11AN INTRODUCTION
Hilary. What is the use of this division into
sections or paragraphs?
Uncle. It shows that the writer is now going to
another part of the subject. Let me explain this by
the first chapter in the Bible.  This chapter consists of seven paragraphs.  The first contains five
verses. The second contains three verses, viz.
verses 6, 7, and 8. The third contains- five verses,
viz. 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.'The fourth, ten verses,
viz. 14-23.   And( so on, to the end. Eaclh of
these little divisions treats of a different branchl of
the history.  Thus the first is a greral intraduction. The second tells us of the creation of light;
the third, of the creation of the firmament; and so on.
Ernest. Suppose we begin with the different
sorts of (livisions, and learn about them in regular
order.
Uncle. Very well. But let me hear whether
you can name them.
Ernest. The Bible is divided into, 1..Testaments; 2. Books; 3. Chapters; 4. Paragraphs;
5. Verses.
Uncle. We have already talked about the first two
of these divisions, into Testaments and books. We
will now proceed to the third, which is chapters..
Ernest. Was the Bible divided into these same
chapters, when it was first written?
UTncle. Not at all. The penmen of the several
128TO TIE SCRIPTURES.
books wrote straight forward; and, I suppose,
made no division, except into sentences; unless
when they came to the end of a sheet or leaf. In
very ancient manuscripts there is no division even
between the words.
Ernest. When was this division into chapters
made?
Uncle. With the exception of the Psalms, which
were always distinct, there was for some ages no division into these smaller portions. The five books of
Moses were, indeed, parcelled into fifty or fifty-four
large sections, called in Hebrew, Parashioth. One
of these was read every Sabbath in the synagogue.
And when, during the persecuted state of the Jews,
they were forbidden to read the Pentateuch, they
substituted the Prophets, which in like manner they
parcelled into fifty-four larger sections, called in
Hebrew, Haphtorth. One of these was read every
Sabbath. Each of these larger sections was also
subdivided, but these portions did not correspond
with the present chapters and verses.
Our present division into chapters was made by
a learned theologian, named Hugo de Sancto Caro.
He was a cardinal, which is the highest dignity
below the pope, and lived about the middle of the
thirteenth century, that is nearly six hundred years
ago. Among his other labours, he undertook to
make a concordance for the Latin Bible.
129AN INTRODUCTION
Hilary. What is a concordance?
Uncle. A concordance is a dictionary, by means
of which we may find any passage of Scripture of
which we rememnber a feyv yvords, For instance,
I remember that there is a text which says that God
" is able to abase" the proud. But I wish to have
the exact words, and. yet qannot, recall the chapter
and verse. I take this concordance, and look for
the word abase. I read all the texts which contain this word. The fourth of them is the one I
want. It is in the fourth chapter of Daniel, and the
thirty-seventh verse: "Those that walk in pride he
is able to abase."  You perceive that such a book
must be very useful. Now Sancto Caro, as I said,
undertook to make such a concordance. But in
order to be of any use, it must of course refer to
the texts by means of some numbers. And as there
were no numbered divisions, he divided the whole
Bible into chapters, the same which we now have.
Hilary. Did he divide these again into verses?
Uncle. Not exactly. He subdivided the chapters into smaller sections, somewhat larger than our
present verses; but instead of the numerals 1, 2,
3, 4, &amp;c., he marked these smaller sections by the
Roman letters A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, which were
placed along the margin, at equal distances. Rabbi
Nathan, a Jew, afterwards adopted the same chapters in the Hebrew Bible. Then they came into
130TO THE SCRIPTURES.
use in other languages, and were adopted in all the
English versions of the Bible.
Ernest. Then I suppose the chapters are the
same in all languages into which the Scriptures
have been translated.
Uncle. Not altogether so. The chapters are
divided differently in the Latin, the German, and
the English;, but this variation occurs only in a
few cases.
Ernest. Now, sir, will you inform us when the
division into verses'took place?
Uncle. The lO-d and the New Testaments were
not divided into verses at the same tiime. The Old
Testament was thus divided by Athias, a Jew of
Amsterdam, who introduced verses into an edition
of the Hebrew Bible, which he printed in 1661.
These same divisions were afterwards employed in
other languages. The New Testament was tllus
divided by a celebrated publisher of ancient works,
named Robert Stephens. We have an account of
this from the pen of his son, Henry Stephens, who
was also a famous scholar. I will read you his
vwords. Henry Stephens says that there are two
very remarkable circumstances relating to'his father's division of the New Testament into verses.
"The first is, that my father finished this division
of each chapter into verses, while travelling from
Paris to Lyons; and indeed the greater part of it,
131AN INTRODUCTION
while riding by the way  The second fact is, that
a short time prior to this Journey, while he had the
matter still in contemplation, almost all to whom
he mentioned it, told ilim plainly, that he was an
indiscreet man; as if he had wished to employ
himself on an affair which would prove utterly useless. But behold the result: in opposition to the
opinion which condemned and discountenanced my
father's undertaking, as soon as his invention was
published, every edition of the New Testament,
whether in Greek, Latin, French, Uerman, or in
any other language, which did not adopt it, was
immediately discarded."
Ernest. I can easily see what a great conyenience it is, to have these divisions, great and
small, and all numbered in regular order. If it
were not for this, it would be very hard to point
out where any particular text is found.
Uncle. True; this is a great convenience, and
thus an advantage to Bible-readers. Yet this seems
to be the only advantage arising from this division;
and there are some great disadvantages.
Ernest. Pray tell me what they are, for I cannot think of any.
Uncle. In the first place, the divisions are sometimes injudicious and unhappy.  Sentences are
separated, which ought to have been left in connexion; and a single sentence is sometimes broken
132TO THE SCRIPTURES.
into two or more verses. This very seriously
affects the sense in certain places. Almost every
reader, when he comes to the end of a verse, naturally supposes that the period is concluded-suspends his voice--and makes a full stop. Let me
give you one or two instances. Hilary, turn to
Colossians iv. 1. That verse, as you will see in
a moment, ought to have ended the preceding chapter, being merely the close of the apostle's exhortation to masters and servants. Again, look at Psalm
xcv. 7: To-day if you will hear his voice, (here
the verse ends,) harden not your hearts. You
perceive the sentence is broken in the very midst,
where there is only a comma.-Read aloud the
12th verse of the next psalm.
Hilary. Let the field be joyful, and all that is
therein; then shall all the trees of the wood rejoiceUncle. See! you have let your voice fall; yet
the sentence goes on in the 13th verse. There is
not even a comma: Theni shall all the trees of the
wood riejoice before the Lord; yet the verses are
divided between the words "rejoice" and " before."
Inr like manner the division into chapters often
breaks the sense.  The 53d chapter of Isaiah
(" Who hath believed our report," &amp;c.) cannot be'nderstood, unless you begin with the 14th verse of
12
133AN INTRODUCTION
the preceding chapter. Look at that verse; it shouldbe the beginning of a chapter.
The verse 1 Cor. xii. 31, really is the introduction to the beautiful chapter which follows. Just
listen how close the connexion is. But covet
earnestly the best gifts. rnd yet I show unto
you a more excellent way. Though I speak with
the tongues of men and of angels, &amp;c. If yotu
look at the twenty-first chapter of the Acts of the
Apostles, you will see that it ends in the middle of
a sentence, with only a comma. These instances
are enough to show you, that there are some disadvantages arising from an unhappy division.
Ernest. But suppose these few places were
divided more judiciously, would there still be any
evils in the division into chapters and verses?
Uncle. I think there would still be a disadvantage, arising from the constant interruption of the
sense, by these small divisions. They break up
the whole narrative or discourse into a sort of disjointed fragments. You would at once be sensible
of this, if I were to give you any other book divided
in this manner.  Let us make the experiment.
Here is a sheet of paper on which I have copied a
part of the Pilgrim's Progress, divided into verses,
after the manner of our modern Bibles. I wish to
know what you think of it.
134TO THE SCRIPTURES.
1. Now there was, not far from the place where
they lay, a castle, called Doubting Castle, the
owner whereof was Giant Despair;
2. And it was in his grounds they were now
sleeping.
3. Wherefore he getting up in the morning early,
and walking up and down in his fields, caught
Christian and Hopeful asleep in his grounds.
4. Then with a grim and surly voice, he bid
them awake, and asked them whence they were,
and what they did in his grounds.
5. They told him they were pilgrims, and that
they had lost their way.
6. Then said the giant, You have this night
trespassed on me, by trampling in, and lying on
my grounds,
7. And therefore you must go along with me.
8. So they were forced to go, because he was
stronger than they.
9. They also had but little to say, for they knew
themselves in a fault.
10. The giant therefore drove them before him,
and put them into his castle, in a very dark dungeon.
Hilary. O, I now see what you mean! These
little divisions produce a constant stoppage-each
sentence seems a thing by itself. I should soon
grow weary of reading a book divided in this way.
135136          AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. Exactly so; and for this very reason
many persons grow more weary of reading the
Scriptures, than they would otherwise be.
Ernest. But why does not some one print an
edition of our English Bible just as other books
are printed?
Uncle. 0 there have been several such. Look
in the book-case behind you, and reach me the
volumes in red morocco. This is just such an
edition as you speak of. All these Bibles are undivided, except into ordinary paragraphs. But they
have the number of the verse marked in the
margin.
And now I think we may dismiss this subject foi
this morning.TO THE SCRIPTURES.

ERNEST and Hilary found that the conversation
of their uncle had this good effect, that it led them
to read more in the Scriptures than they had ever
done before.  Often during the day, they might be
seen with their little pocket Bibles in their hands,
turning over the leaves, finding the places which
had been pointed out to them, and examining one
another upon what they had learned. The frext
day was Sunday, and they spent much of their
time in careful reading of the Scriptures. On
Monday morning they hastened at a very early
hour to the study, where they found their affectionate uncle ready to receive them. "Well, my boys,"
said he, as he placed seats for them near the fire,
" what have you got to inquire about this- morning?"
Elrnest. I think you said, sir, that the Psalms
were always divided just as they are at present.
Uncle. Yes.   Because each psalm was a separate composition; being a hvmn or a prayer com12*
137AN INTRODUCTION
about Christmas; where are we going to spend the
holidays?"
" I heard father-say," said Ernest, " that we are
to go and see uncle Austin, in New Jersey; and I
am very glad of it, for I like uncle Austin. You
were never at his house--were you, Hilary?"
"No, brother; you remember I had broken my
collar-bone, and could not go out, when you went
to Jersey. Tell me something about him. What
is he like?"
"Like!" said Ernest; " why, he is like one of
the best men in the world. He is like one of the
good old folks we read about in the Bible. He
has gray hair hanging down over his neck, and
when he goes out he walks with a cane. But he
is so kind and so gentle! I never heard a cross
word out of his mouth. When Tom and I broke
his great inkstand, and blacked all his papers, he
only said,' O0, children, children; I shall have to
teach you the way to be careful!' "
" 0, then, I am sure," said Hilary, "he will
give us a Christmas present!"
"Do not be thinking about Christmas presents,
Hilary. Uncle Austin will do better than that.
He will give us such good talk, and tell us so many
pretty histories, and show us so many curiosities,
and draw us so many pictures, that you will forget
all about Christmas boxes, and the like."
12AN INTRODUCTION
posed on some special occasion. They were afterwards collected and arranged as we now have
them.
Ernest. I have been looking at the 119th Psalm,
which seems to be the longest chapter in the Bible,
for it has a hundred and seventy-six verses. But
I see that it is also divided into other divisions. I
have counted them; there are twenty-two of them.
Each one contains eight verses, and each one has
a strange word over the top, such as sdleph, Beth,
Girnel, &amp;c. I have often wondered what this
meant.
Un5cle. I can soon explain this. But first let me
ask whether you know what an acrostic is?
Hilary. 0 yes, we know that very well. An
acrostic is a poem, in which the first letter of ievery
line being taken, makes up the name of some person.
Ernest. I have seen a poem of sixteen lines, in
praise of General Washington; and if you took all
the first letters of the lines together, they spelt
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
Uncle. Very well. The 119th Psalm is a kind
of acrostic; not indeed in English, but in Hebrew.
If you.could read Hebrew, I would show you that
every one of the eight verses begins with the same
letter. And the name of that letter is placed at the
beginning of the division.TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Hilary. Then these hard words, Mleph, Beth,
and so on, are the names of the Hebrew letters-?
Uncle. Exactly so. The old Hebrew alphabet
contained twenty-two letters.  Their names are
Aleph, Beth, Gimel, &amp;c. These names you will
find set down in regular order in this psalm. Each
of the first eight verses begins with some word
which begins with l4eph; each of the second set
with Beth, and so on to the end.
Ernest. rhis is surprising, indeed. Are there
any other parts of Scripture written in the same
way?
Uncle. Yes, this was a favourite method with
the Hebrew poets.
Hilary. What was the use of this arrangement?
Uncle. I suppose it was meant to assist the memory. It is commonly used where there are a
number of little unconnected sentences, or proverbs,
which it would be difficult to recollect without
some such aid. There are twelve of these acrostical poems in the Old Testament. In most cases,
however, only a single verse begins with each
letter.
Three of these passages are perfectly alphabetical, namely, Psalms cxi. and cxii. and the third
chapter of Lamentations. Each line is marked by
its initial letter. In the other nine passages, only
every stanza is thus distinguished.  These are
139AN INTRODUCTION
Psalms xxv. xxxiv. xxxvii. cxix. cxlv.  Prov.
xxxi. 10-31. Lam. i. ii. and iv.
Hilary. Then all these twelve poems must have
been divided into verses from the first. Must they
not?
Uncle. Yes, you are right. For the letters of
the alphabet, with which every line or stanza began,
separated it into a distinct verse. And now, as we
have explained the difficulty about the 119th Psalm,
we may proceed to something else.
Ernest. If you have nothing else to teach us
just now, there is a question which I should like
to ask.
Uncle. Ask it, my child.
Ernest. I have been turning over the leaves of
this large English Bible on your table, and T set,
that it differs in some things from our small pocket
Bibles.
Uncle. In what respects do you observe any dif
ference?
Ernest. Why, sir, I see a line at the top of ever)
column throughout the whole book. That is one,
difference. Please to look at the second page, over
the second chapter of Genesis. Here are the
words, The first Sabbath. And over the next
column are the words, The naming of the creatures. And so on page after page-The serpent
tempteth Eve-Man is cast out of Paradise-The
140TO THE SCRIPTURES.
curses of Cain; and so it continues through every
book in the Bible.
Uncle. These little lines at the top of the page
are called the " running-titles."  They were made,
I believe, by the same persons who translated the
Bible. They are intended to show what is the
subject of the verses below them. Thus, if you
were looking through Exodus, to find when the
Passover was instituted, you would have only to
turn over the pages rapidly, reading the running
titles; and after turning over five or six leaves, you
would come to the words The Passover is instituted, immediately over the 12th chapter. This
would be just what you wished to find. In all
complete copies of the Bible these running-titles
are inserted, but they are omitted in many of the
smaller and cheaper editions.
Ernest. I observe also at the beginning of every
chapter in the whole Bible several lines of the same
kind, in the same sort of type.
Uncle. I see what you mean. These are the
titles of the chapters. They tell you what is contained in the chapter, and are a sort of index to the
Scriptures. They answer the same purpose with
the running-titles, but they are more full and comprehensive. Thus if you look at the 12th chapter
of Exodus, to which you turned just now, and read
the title. you will see what the chapter contains.
141AN INTRODUCTION.
1. 77The beginning of the year is changed. 3. The
Passover is instituted. 11. Thle rite of the Passover. 15. Unleavened bread. 29. Thefirst-born
are slain. 31. The Israelites are driven out of
the land. 37. They come to Succoth. 43. The
ordinance of the Passover.
Hilary. What do those little figures mean in the
middle of the sentences?
Uncle. They show at what verse each subject
begins; thus the figure 3 shows that the " institution of the Passover" is related at the third verse.
So you perceive these titles of the chapters are very
useful in helping us to find any particular passage.
These also are left out in the smaller and cheaper
editions.
Take notice that you may read these titles
straight on, through a whole book, (omitting the
numerals,) and you will thus have a little abridgement of all the book contains. Let us take, for example, the book of Ruth, because it is short. I
will merely read the titles of the four chapters,
without stopping.
" Elimelech, driven by famine into Moab, dieth
there. Mahlon and Chilion, having married wives
of Moab, die also. Naomi, returning homeward,
dissuadeth her two daughters-in-law from going
with her. Orpah leaveth her, but Ruth with great
constancy accompanieth her. They two come to
142TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Beth-lehem, where they are gladly received. Ruth
gleaneth in the fields of Boaz. Boaz, taking knowledge of her, showeth her great favour. That which
she got, she carrieth to Naomi. By Naomi's instruction, Ruth lieth at Boaz's feet. Boaz acknowledgeth the right of a kinsman. He sendeth her
away with six measures of barley. Boaz calleth
into judgment the next kinsman. Ile refuseth the
redemption according to the manner of Israel.
Boaz buyeth the inheritance. He marries Ruth.
She beareth Obed, the grandfather of David. The
genealogy of Pharez."
Here, you see, we have a little epitome of the
whole history. And I have often found it useful,
after I have finished the perusal of any book in the
Bible, to go back, and read over all the titles of the
chapters, in order to refresh my memory, and fix
the connexion of events in my mind.
Iilary. Now, uncle, I have another thing which
I wish to have explained. There is still something
on every page of the large Bible which I do not
find in our smaller ones. Down each side of every
page there are a great many words in very small
print. If you will look at the first chapter in'the
Bible, you will see what I mean. Just by the side
of the first verse, on the left hand, I read
a John 1. 1, 2. Heb. 1. 10.
b Ps. 8.3. &amp; 33. 6. &amp; 89.11, 12.
&amp; 102. 25. &amp; 136. 5. &amp;c.
143AN INTRODUCTION
And a little lower down, by the sixth verse, I
read, Heb. between the light and between the darkness.
Uncle. All this, you perceive, is in the margin.
Hilary. What is meant by the margin?
Uncle. The margin is the edge of any thing.
Thus the margin of a river is the edge of the river;
the margin of a page is the edge of the page, which
is commonly left blank. But sometimes there are
little notes or explanations printed in this margin,
either at the sides or at the bottom; and these are
called marginal notes.'The small print, which
you observe at the sides of the page in the large
Bible, is of three kinds. It consists, first, of marginal readings, or translations; secondly, of marginal explanations; and, thirdly, of marginal
references.
Hilary. What do you mean by marginal readings?
Uncle. I will explain. In many cases, the Hebrew or the Greek text might be translated in two
different ways. The translators were perhaps
doubtful which was the best. They therefore
placed one of these in the text, and the other in the
margin. Sometimes also, the exact literal translation would sound very strange in English, and then
they would put it into the margin.
Ernest. Please to explain this a little further.
144TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Uncle. I will try to make myself understood.
There are two sorts of marginal translations. And
take notice they may be distinguished by the little
word which precedes them. Every one of these
little marginal readings begins, either with the letters Heb. or with the word Or. For example,
look again at this first chapter of Genesis. There
is a marginal reading at verse 4; it begins with the
letters Heb. The marginal readings at verses 5,
6. 11. 14. 16. and 20, all begin with Heb. They
are therefore of the first kind.
Hilary. What is there peculiar in this first kind.
of marginal readings?
Uncle. They are all exact, literal translations from,
the Hebrew or the Greek. As it is the same in both,
I will confine myself to the Old Testament. Whenever you find a marginal note beginning with Heb.,.
you may know that it is a very literal translation,
from the Hebrew-often so literal that it would.
not sound right in English.   The letters Hebo
stand for Hebrew, and signify "In the original:
Hebrew it is" so and so.  Thus look at the marginal note to the 4th verse; it is as follows: Heb.
between the light and between the darkness. Tni.s
is a translation word for word from the Hebrewo.
But this does not sound well in English, and there--
fore the translation in the text is, " the light from~
the darkness."
13
145'AN INTRODUCTION
In the New Testament, this first kind of marginal
readings is just the same, except that Gr. is used
instead of Heb.  Gr. stands for Greek, in which
language you remember the New Testament was
written.
Hilary. Well, uncle, I think we understand
about the first kind of marginal readings. They
always begin with Heb. or Gr.; and they always
contain a translation which is, word for word, like
the Hebrew or Greek.
Uncle. Exactly right. Now you remember I
told you of a second kind.
Ernest. Yes, sir; the second kind of marginal
readings begins with the word Or.
Hilary. There is one in the chapter we have
open. Gen. i. It is at verse 20.
Ernest. Here is another in the second chapter,
at verse 14.
Uncle. Wherever the marginal reading is of this
second kind, beginning with Or, the original admits of two different translations. One of them is
put in' the text; the other is put in the margill.
Thus, in the first case, (Gen. i. 20,) the translation in the text is, the "moving" creature; but
the margin says "or creeping:" because the Hebrew word may be rendered either " moving" or
" creeping." And in the second case, (Gen. ii. 14,)
the translation in the text is, that is it which
146TO THE SCRIPTURES.
goeth " toward the east of" Assyria; but the margin says " or eastward to.tssyria:" because the
Hebrew words may be rendered either way. And
the sense is oftenl very different.
Hilary. Is the translation in the margin by the
same persons who made the other translation?
Uncle. The very same; and is of equal authority. It is to be wished that every edition of the
Scriptures had these marginal readings, because, in
some instances, tile best translation is placed in
the margin.
Ernest. How did this happen? Did not the
translators make the text as perfect as they could?
Uncle. There was, you know, a translation in
common use before this was made. The people
had a great affection for this old version, and did
not like to see any alterations made. King James,
therefore, commanded the translators to make no
ulnnecessary changes in the old expressions. And,
therefore, in many cases, they inserted the less correct version in the text, and placed the proper one
in the margin, lest they should disturb the minds
of common readers.*
* The first rule riven by James I. to the translators was
in these words: "The ordinary Bible read in the church,
commonly called the Bishops' Bible, to be followed, and as
little altered as the original will permit."
147TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Hilary looked sober for a while, and then said:
"Brother Ernest, is this the same uncle that the
boys used to call the Bible man?"
"Yes," said Ernest, "this is he. Whenever
he went out walking, he used to carry Bibles and
New Testaments in his great old-fashioned pockets,
to give away to the poor people. This made them
call him the Bible man. But besides this, you
know he used to be a great traveller; and when he
came from sea, some years ago, he brought with
him several boxes of books. When the boxes were
opened, they were full of Bibles!"
Hilary. Why what could he do with so many?
Ernest. I will tell you. There is a society in
England called the British and Foreign Bible Society. They get Bibles in all languages, and send
them all over the world. When uncle Austin was
in London, he says that he was so delighted to see
the great piles of Bibles for the heathen people,
that the tears ran down his face. He bought one
Bible in each of the languages, and brought them
over to America with him. They fill several shelves
in his library.
Hilary. Can he read in them all?
Ernest. O, no! He can read in a number of
them, because he has lived in a great many different countries. But then, he says it is a memorial
of the Bible Society. Whenever he looks at his
2

Hilary. It seems to me that these marginal readings are not in half our Bibles.
Uncle. That is, unhappily, true. Most of our
Anierican Bibles omit them.  But they are o'
equal value with the other translation, and often
afford great help in understanding a passage.TO THE SCRIPTITUES.

Hilary. THERE seem to be some other things
in the margin which are not translations.
Uncle. Yes, you remember I told you before,*
that besides the marginal readings, there were two
other sorts of notes in the margin.
Ernest. I remember them; marginal explanations, and marginal references.
Uncle. I have explained to you the marginal
readings; now we will go on to the marginal explanations.  Some of these give the dates of the
transactions recorded. These are commonly at the
top of the page, just under the running-title. I
suppose you know what is meant by the date of a
transaction.
Ernest. Yes, sir; the time when any thing
takes place.
* See page 141.
13*
149AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. Turn again to the first chapter of Genesis, and you will see over the top," Before CHRIST,
4004." That is, the world was created four thousand and four years before the birth of our Saviour.
Such dates you will find at every page.
Ernest. In the New Testament, the words are
different. The words " Anno DOMINI" are at the
top of each page.
Uncle..nno Domini means, " In the year of
our Lord," and then follows the number of years
from Christ's birth. Thus in the Old Testament,
we reckon backwards from the advent of Christ,
and in the New Testament, we reckon forwards
from the same point.
Hilary. In some places there is a syllable put
before the number of the year. Over the eleventh
chapter of Judges, it- says, "Before CHRIST cir.
1143." What is meant by cir.?
Uncle. I am always pleased to see you on the
watch for something.  Cir. stands for the Latin
word circiter, which means about.   That is,
"'tlbout 1143 years before Christ;" for in many
cases, the translators could not fix the exact date,
but came as near to it as they could. And I will
take this occasion to say, that learned men differ
very much about the precise time when many
other events took place. In a number of instances,
the dates given at the top of the margin are thought
150TO THE SCRIPTURES.
to be incorrect: yet they are generally very useful,
and we should have a much better understanding of
what we read, if we more commonly took notice of
them.
Ernest. Are these numbers always at the top of
the column?
Uncle. No. Often they are in the middle, or,
indeed, in ally other part of the margin. Thus in
the eleventh chapter, there is a date given after
every five or six verses.
But this is not the only kind of explanations
which occur in the margin.   There are also
little remarks in various places, intended to explain some difficulty in the text. I will give you
several examples. Look at Gen. v. 29, and you
will find a note which tells you that the name Noah
means rest or comfort. At Josh. xxiii. 34, we
read that a certain altar was called Ed; in the margin we read the meaning of the word, " That is,
witness."  In Judg. vi. 24, another altar is called
Jehovah-shalom: in the margin we read, " That is,
the LORD send peace."
Ernest. Are all these little remarks explanations
of proper names?
Uncle. Not all of them, though the greater number are; for many of them are little comments
on the text. Look at Judg. iii. 30, and you will
find the remark: "It seems to concern only the
151AN INTRODUCTION
country next the Philistines." And in the history
of Jephthah, (Judg. xi. 29,) we read in the note.
" Jephthah seems to have been iudge only of North
East Israel." So also you will find a longer note
at 2 Kings xv. 1.  And another at Hos. ix. 3
And again at Luke xix. 13, where an account is
given of a nobleman who gave his servants " ten
pounds;" the marginal explanation says: " Mina,
here translated a pound, is twelve ounces and a
half: which, according to five shillings the ounce,
is three pounds two shillings and sixpence."
Now we have gone over two kinds of marginal
notes, first, marginal readings or translations, and
secondly, marginal explanations. And these ex
planations we found were of three sorts,-dates,
translations of proper names, and short observations. A third kina of marginal notes still remains.
Ernest. Yes, uncle, marginal references; and
I think I see them now, without having you to
point them out to me. In the very first page, the
small print-by the first verse in the Bible; are
not these marginal references?
Uncle. Yes. The words "a John 1. 1, 2.
Heb. 1. 10," and all similar words are what I
mean. These refer you to other texts in the Scriptures, which teach the same doctrine, or afford
some useful explanation. Thus the first of these
references is placed by the opening verse of Gene152TO THE SCRIPTURES.
sis: "In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth." And the reference in the margin
is to John 1. 1, 2, which teaches the same truth:
" In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God. The same
was in the beginning with God."
Hilary. What is the meaning of the little letter
(a) prefixed to the reference?
Uncle. It points out what word or phrase in the
text is particularly illustrated by the reference.
Do you not see the same little letter in the text?
Hilary. 0 yes! I see a little a at the word
"beginning."
Uncle. That is the portion of the text which is
illustrated by John i. 1, 2. And if you look a little
further you will see the letter b, before the phrase,
"God created;" the same small letter in the margin refers you to the passages which teach the
same doctrine.
Ernest. What is the use of these marginal references?
Uincle. They point out other passages which
help us to understand the text. Now, remember,
these other passages are what are called parallel
passages; that is, passages which are alikewhich teach the same thiig--or which explain one
another. And these are very usefull; for very often
a thing is stated briefly in one passage, which is
153AN INTRODUCTION
explained at length in another. Or a truth is partly
expressed in one place, and fully expressed in an
other. Or a statement is made in one passage, anld
some fact which makes it very clear is given in the
parallel passage.
Ernest. Be so good as to give us an example.
Uncle. Turn then to the last verse of the first
chapter of Hebrews.
Ernest. Heb. i. 14:.re they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to ministerfor them who
shall be heirs of salvation?
Uncle. That teaches us that the angels are ministering spirits, or that they attend upon the children
of God. Now look for the marginal references, in
regular order.
Ernest. The letter x points out the first set.
Gen. xix. 16. Yes, I see this text relates how
two angels delivered Lot out of Sodom.
Hilary. Gen. xxxii. 1, 2. 24. These texts tell
about the angels who met Jacob, and about the
angel who wrestled with him.
Ernest. Ps. xxxiv. 7: " The angel of the Lord
encampeth round about them that fear him, and
delivereth them."
Hilary. Ps. xci. 11: "For He shall give his
angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy
ways."
Ernest. Ps. ciii. 20, 21  " Bless the Lord, ye
154TO THE SCRIPTURES.
his angels that excel in strength, that do his commandments," &amp;c.
Hilary. Dan. iii. 28. This speaks of an anlgel
who delivered the three young men from the furIlace.
Ernest. Dan. vii. 10: "Thousand thousands
ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times tell
thousand stood before Him."
Uncle. You need not read any further. I am
sure you see already the light which is thrown on
Scripture, by examining the parallel texts.
Ernest. It seems to be almost as good as a commentary.
Uncle. Very often the parallel passages furnish
the best commentary in the world.
This is so truly the case, that it is surprising
how much knowledge of the Bible may be obtained
by a common reader, who carefully makes use of
all these marginal references. On this subject the
learned Bishop Horsley says:
"It is incredible to any one who has not made
the experiment, what a proficiency may be made
in that knowledge which maketh wise unto salvation, by studying the Scriptures in this manner,
without any other commentary, or exposition,
than what the different parts of the sacred volume
mutuc2ly furnish for each other. Let the most
illiterate Christian study them in this manner, and
155AN INTRODUCTION
let him never cease to pray for the illumination of
that Spirit by which these books were dictated: and
the whole compass of abstruse philosophy and recondite history shall furnish no argument with
which the perverse will of man shall be able to
shake this learned Christian's faith."*
Ernest. Now I believe we have finished all the
three kinds of marginal notes. I will try to repeat
them. First, marginal readings; which are
either more exact translations from the Hebrew, or
translations with another meaning.  Secondly,
marginal explanations; which are dates, or translations of proper names, or short observations.
Thirdly, marginal refereznces, or parallel passages.
Uncle. I wish you to observe that in our ordinary editions, these are all in the margin, but of
late years a number of excellent editions of the Bible have appeared, with these marginal notes and
references between the column. Such are Bagster's
London Bibles, the Reference Bibles of the American Bible Society, and an edition published by
the Society of Friends. All these are truly excellent editions.
Ernest. I have seen some Bibles which seem to
have a much larger collection of references to parallel texts.
* Horsley's Nine Sermons, p. 224-238.
156157
Uncle. True. The labour of biblical students
has been constantly adding to the number, for many
years. You would be surprised to learn how vast
is the amount of these collections. To give you
some- idea of this, I will give you on a paper the
names of certain editions of the Bible, with their
respective dates, and the number of marginal references in each.

Besides these, I might mention Reference Bibles

Clarke, and also those published by Mr. Bagster of
London.
Ernest. There is another thing I wish to have
explained. I have often taken notice that different
sorts of print are used in the Bible. Why is this?
Uncle. Ah! you mean the Italics. But let me
see whether you are acquainted with the difference
between Roman and Italic letters. This sentence
is in Roman type:
" He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like
a city that is broken down, and without walls."
Ernest. Here is the same verse in Italic type:
14
TPO   rTHEP E 1 -. -iCr4 ruf.AN INTRODUCTION
shelves of Bibles, he thinks of the good men who
are trying to send the Bible all over the earth. He
has given away a number of them to poor Frenchmen, and Spaniards, and others. And when there
was a Greek in his neighbourhood, he sent him a
present of a New Testament in modern Greek.
Hilary. Uncle Austin must be a great scholar.
Ernest. He is a great Bible scholar. He reads
in the Bible more than in all his other books. And
this is another reason why the neighbours call him
the Bible man. Whenever they come in, they
find him at his Bible.
Hilary. I wonder he does not get tired of reading so much in one book. I get tired of reading a
single hour in the Bible.
Ernest. And you ought to be ashamed of it.
But only go to uncle Austin's, and he will explain
it all to you. I cannot say the things as he says
them; but I can tell you this, that ever since I was
at Oakdale, where he lives, I have had very different thoughts about the Bible.
Hilary. Well, it may be so: but I hope he has
somebody to cook the Christmas dinner, and make
the pies and cakes, while he is at his books.
Ernest. There you are at your jokes again!
Why, Hilary, you would make one think that you
care for nothing but eating. Uncle Austin is a
widower.  His wife has been dead more than
14AN INTRODUCTION
"He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like
a city that is broken down, and without walls."
Itilary. Yes, I know the difference. The Italic
letters lean a little more, and are shaped more like
our common writing letters.
Utncle. Now look at the same verse in the
twenty-fifth chapter of Proverbs, last verse:
" He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like
a city that is broken down, and without walls."
Now tell me whether this is in Roman or Italic
type.
Ernest. Partly in one, and partly in the other.
The words hath-is like-that is--and and, are
in Italics; all the rest are in Roman. Now what
I want to learn is, why these words arc in
Italics?
Uncle. To show that they are not in the original,
but are supplied by the translators in order to complete the sense. Very often, if a verse should be
translated word for word, it would be scarcely intelligible in English. Read this passage, omitting
the wvords in Italics, and you will perceive what I
mean.
Hilary. "He that...... no rule over his own
spirit... a city...broken down....without walls."
Uncle. Wherever the translators insert a word
which is not in the Greek or the Hebrew, they had
it printed in this way. And this shows the re15STO THE SCRIPTURES.
inarkable honesty of our translation, where not even
an "'if" or an " and" is added, without being thus
acknowledged. Commonly a few words only are
added; but in some verses more are necessary. It is
very important for every Bible reader to understand
this use of Italics. For in other books, Italics are
often employed to show that a particular emphasis
is to be laid on the word thus printed. But in the
Bible, the words in Italics are never emphatical.
Hilary. Are not the marginal readings also in
Italics?
Uncle. Commonly they are so. But sometimes
the marginal readings have words which are not in
the original, and these are printed in Roman letters.
Thus in 2 Chron. xx. 24, in the margin we read,
" there was not an escaping."  The words " there
was" are not in the Hebrew.
Ernest. I see how it is. The printing in the
margin is exactly the reverse of the printing in the
text.
Uncle. Precisely. What would be Roman in
the text, is Italic in the margin; and what would
be Italic in the text, is Roman in the margin.
Ernest. In many texts I see that some of the
words are in large letters.
Uncle. Sometimes very important words are
printed in capitals. The most remarkable case of
this is the naIne LORD. You will observe that it
159AN INTRODUCTION
is sometimes in small letters, and sometimes in
capitals. It is in capitals only when the Hebrew
word JEHOVAH is used in the original. This is the
most awful name of God. It is supposed to signify
the divine self-existence, eternity, and independence.
Ernest. This is something entirely new to me.
Uncle. And it is worthy of being remembered.
Wherever you find the divine name LORD in small
capitals, you may be sure that in the Hebrew it is
JEHOVAH. But whenever it is in ordinary letters,
there is some other namre in the Hebrew.*  You
will see both names in the first verse of the eighth
psalm: " O0 LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy
name in all the earth!" Which might be read
thus: "0 Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy
name in all the earth!" Indeed, some learned meni
are of the opinion that the word Jehovah should
have been retained in all places, as it has been in
many.
Ernest. But capitals are used in printing some
other words; are they not?
Uncle. They are; as, for instance, when some
divine name is mentioned, to which great attention
ought to be paid. In Ex. iii. 14, we have one of
the names of God: I AM THAT I AM. In Zech. vi.
12, Christ is called the BRANCH. In Jer. xxiii. 6,
* Commonly Adonai.
160TO THE SCRIPTTTRES.
it is said, " And this is his name whereby he shall
be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."
Again, when an inscription or the quotation of
some title is repeated, it is sometimes put in small
capitals. You will better understand this from the
examples. In Ex. xxxix. 30, we have the title or
inscription which was engraved on the crown of
the high-priest: HOLINESS TO THE LORD. In Zech.
xiv. 20, we have the same inscription. In Dan. v.
25, we have the inscription on Belshazzar's wall:
MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. In Matt. xxvii.
37, we have the title which was placed over the
head of our crucified Redeemer: THIs IS JEsus
THE KING OF THE JEws. This title was in three
languages, and you will see other forms of it, in
Mark xv. 26, Luke xxiii. 38, and John xix. 19.
In Rev. xix. 16, we have the inscription which was
on the vesture and the thigh of Messiah: KING OF
KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. All these are in capitals, and these may serve as examples. Indeed
these are almost all the instances in the whole Bible.
Hilary. Now, uncle, I hope we are done with all
that relates to the printing and type.
Uncle. There is only one little matter of this
sort which remains. Look at the first epistle of
John, second chapter and twenty-third verse.
Hilary. " Whosoever denieth the Son, the same
14*
161AN INTRODUCTION
hath not the Father: [but he that acknowledgeth
the Son hath the Father also.]
Ernest. Here is something more than Italics;
here are ten words in a sort of parenthesis.
Uncle. Those ten words are enclosed in marks
[ ] which are called brackets.  These brackets
show that the translators doubted whether the words
between these marks belonged to the Scriptures.
Ernest. Why were they in any doubt about it?
Uncle. I suppose because it was wanting in the
chief ancient manuscripts which they consulted.
It is entirely wanting in the earlier English versions.
But all learned commentators at this day agree that
it does really form a part of holy Scripture, and
therefore the brackets might be omitted.
And now, Hilary, we have finished all that relates to the type and printing. Though it may
have been a little dry, it will prove useful to you
through life. You may now go out, and divert
yourselves with your Christmas plays.

The dedication to King James-Tables at the end of the English
Bible-Proper names which are written differently in different places-Hard words in the book of Psalms-Selah, Higgaion, etc.-Untranslated words-Hosanna, Tirshatha, etc.Obsolete words-List of these.
IT has always been observed, that the more diligently any one studies the Scriptures, the more
pleasure he takes in the s2tudy.  Those who know
most about the Bible love it best.  It is like a precious mine, in which the deeper we go the more
profitable do we find our labour. Our two little
boys already experienced the truth of this. They
had spent a good part of their Christmas holidays
in listening to their unele's conversations about the
Bible, and yet they frequently said to one another
that they had never passed a vacation so agreeably.
As they were sitting by the fire in the study, the
next morning, before their uncle came in, Hilary
said'to his brother," Do you remember, Ernest,
that before we left New York I told you that I
wondered how our uncle could avoid being weary
of reading so much in the Bible?"
Ernest. Yes, I remember it very well; but
what do you think about it now?
163AN INTRODUCTION
Hilary. I do not wonder any longer, for I see
that it is the most interesting book in all the world
Every time I open my pocket Bible, I find something which I did not understand formerly, but
which my uncle has explained to me.
Ernest. So do I. Now I know what is meant
by the capitals, and the Italics, and the marginal
readings, and this makes me take vastly more pleasure in the book than I ever could do before. But
there are still two or three things which I wish to
have explained.
Hilary. What are they?
Ernest. I will let you know as soon as our
uncle comes in. 0 here he is already! Let us get
our books and papers ready.
Uncle. Boys, are you ready for another lesson?
Hilary. Yes, sir, indeed we are, and Ernest has
found out several other things in the English Bible
which he does not understand.
Ernest. There is a dedication at the beginning
of the Bible, and there are several tables at the
close of the Old T.estament. You have never said
any thing about these.
Uncle. This is easily explained. You remember that I gave you a history of our English version,
and told you that it was made by the order of King
James the First. When the translators, therefore,
had completed their work, they thought it right to
164TO THE SCRIPTURES.
dedicate it to their sovereign, and caused this dedication to be composed, and printed in the beginning
of the Bible. It is placed in all English Bibles,
and in such American Bibles as were printed before
the Revolution. But it is now very properly omitted,
as it contains nothing worthy of accompanying the
word of God.
The tables of which you spoke are also by the
translators, and they have been of great use to thousands of pious readers. There is a Table of Scripture Measures, which shows the value of the ancient measures used in the Bible, and giving us the
amount in feet and inches, or in gallons and pints,
or in bushels and pecks, as the case may be. Thus
a homer is equal to seventy-five gallons, five pints,
and a fraction. There is a Table of Weights and
Money, and also a Table of Time. If you only
know the rule in arithmetic called reduction, you
may easily find, from this money table, how many
dollars and cents are contained in any sum of money
mnentioned in Scripture.
The first editions of our English Bible contained
i long and excellent preface by the translators,
which has been omitted in later copies.
Ernest. I think I have observed that some proper names are different in the Old and New Testaments.
Uncle. That is true. And not only so, some
165AN INTRODUCTION
names are differently written in different places in
the same Testament. For example, let Hilary
read the eighth verse of the fourth chapter of Hebrews.
Hilary. " For if Jesus had given them rest, then
would he not afterward have spoken of another
day."
Uncle. Whom does the apostle mean by Jesus?
Ernest. I suppose he means the Lord Jesus.
Uncle. Not at all. He means Joshua. This
person is called by four names in Scripture: Joshua,
Jehoshua, Oshea, and Jesus. Acts vii. 45. Num.
xiii. 8. 16. In order to assist you in your reading
of the Scriptures, I will give you a little table of
the principal names which appear in more than one
form, with some references to the places. This

twenty years. But he has a good kind niece, who

to be attentive to the "little masters," as he calls
the boys.
The boys then turned to their books, and studied
as usual until the family were called to family worship. When they retired to bed, Hilary thought a
great deal about the approaching holidays. In the
morning, he awaked his brother, and said, " Ernest,
are you sure that this good old uncle of our's will
be glad to see us?"
"Yes," said Ernest, "his face will be bright
with joy."
"But," said Hilary, " if he studies the Bible so
much, and is so very religious, I should think he
would be very solemn and dry."
" That," replied Ernest, " is one of your ignorant notions. When you see uncle Austin, you
will see that religion does not make people gloomy.
He is a happy old gentleman, and he loves the little
children so much, that he often carries bundles of
little books to give away at the doors of the country
schools. But I will tell you one thing; you had
better be brushing up your knowledge of the Bible
before you go, for uncle sometimes asks some hard
questions."
The holidays came at last. The boys were up
15AN INTRODUCTION
Ernest. Why is there this difference?
Uncle. Some of the differences are in the Heorew, and cannot be accounted for now. Others
arise from following the Hebrew spelling in the
Old Testament, and the Greek in the New. Thus
Noe is the Greek way of writing Noah. King
James, in the third rule given to the translators,
directed " the names of the prophets and the holy
writers, with the other names in the text, to be retained as near as may be, accordingly as they are
vulgarly used."
Ernest. Since our last conversation, I have observed several words in the book of Psalms, which
I have never been able to understand.
Uncle. Repeat some of thenim.
Ernest. I mean such words as Michtam,,qijeleth-Shahar, Shoshan-eduth, Selah, &amp;c.
Uncle. I perceive your difficulty. Most of these
words occur in the titles of the Psalms, and they
were left untranslated, because their sig.nification
could not be ascertained. If you read in a Reference
Bible such as I have been describing, you will find
in the margin the probable translation of many of
these words.'They are Hebrew words. Some of
them are thought to refer to the contents of the
psalm. Others are supposed to point out tunes or
musical instruments. No word has ever perplexed
learned critics more than SELAH, which is found
168TO THE SCRIPTURES.
seventy times in the Psalms, and three times in
Habakkuk. Some of the wisest Jews have supposed it to be both a musical note, and a sign that
there is something in the sense particularly deserving of the reader's meditation. But I should have
to make a commentary if I were to dwell on the
explanation of these difficulties, and must, therefore,
advise you to look into the best notes on the Scriptures which you may have at hand.
You will also find in various parts of the English Bible, words which have either been left just
as they are in the original, or only changed so far
as to give them an English sound. Thus HOSANNA,
which means, Save, we pray thee; ALLELUIA,
or HALLELUJAH, which means Praise the Lord;
TIRSHATHA, which means governor; AMEN, whichl
means verily, or be it so; SABAOTH, which means
arnies; RACA, which means worthless fellow;
BELIAL, which means abandoned wickedness:
PROSELYTE, which means a convertfronm the Gentiles; PHYLACTERIES, which is the Greelk for a
superstitious inscription; BAPTISM, and BAPTIZE,
of which the precise signification is a matter of difference among good Christians. However strange
it may seem to find so many foreign words left untranslated by these learned men, you ought to be
informed that the preceding versions, and also the
169)AN INTRODUCTION
English versions now used by Roman Catholics,
have a great many more.
Hilary. Will you be so obliging as to mention
some of them?
Uncle. Here are some of them: Parasceve, for
preparation; Holocaust, for whole burnt-offering;
Pasche, for passover; dzymes, for unleavened
bread; Paraclete, for Comforter; Neophlyte, for a
new convert; and many more.
Hilary. After all, uncle, I have some things still
to inquire about. There are several places in the
Bible where the expressions seem to me to be very
odd; so much so that I have often been ready to
smile.
Uncle. Perhaps I foresee what you mean; and
if I do not mistake, you will find almost all these
odd expressions to be phrases which were good
English two hundred years ago, but which have
now become obsolete.
Hilary. Pray, uncle, what do you mean by obsolete?
Uncle. That which is worn out of use is obsolete.
Any word which has ceased to be commonly used
is said to be an obsolete word. Our language is
perpetually changing; old words are going into
disuse, and new words are coming in by hundreds.
So that no one need wonder that a book two centuries old should contain many expressions which
170TO THE SCRIPTURES.
are now obsolete. Some of these words are no
longer used at all; others of them are no longer
used in the same sense.
Hilary. I should like to have a specimen of such
words; for I believe you have really hit upon just
what I was about to say.
Uncle. It is easy to gratify you, as I have a list
already made out. Although it is not complete, I
hope it will answer your purpose.

15*AN INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER XIV.
Certain preliminary knowledge which is necessary in order to
understand the Scriptures-Supposed case of a Chinese Life
of Washington-Ancient geography-Chronology-Manners
and customs of the East.
ON a pleasant winter's evening, after the boys
had been spending most of the day in a sleigh-ride
to a neighbouring village, they were called into
their uncle's study. The windows were closed,
and a bright fire was burning o(n the hearth.  The
sofa was wheeled round, and two cheerful lamps
were placed upon a table, which was covered with
books, maps, and pictures. Uncle Austin signified
that he wished them to take their seats on each
side of him, and Ernest and Hilary awaited, with
faces of happy expectation, the instructions which
seemed to be prepared for them. Their good
teacher began as follows:
Uncle. My lads, are you fond of history?
Hilary. 0 yes, sir, we have read several histories.
Uncle. What histories have you read?
Ernest. I can hardly tell you, without considering, they are so many. There is Goldsmith's History of Greece, and of Rome, and of England; and
174TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Scott's Tales of a Grandfather; and the History
of the Jews.
Hilary. Yes, and Irving's Life of Columbus,
and the Life of General Washington.
Uncle. All very good. Now let me ask you a
question or two. Which of these do you like the
most?
Ernest. I think I like the last one best.
Hilary. I am sure I do. Washington was the
father of his country. I love to read about him-I
love to see his very name. We have read his life
three or four times over.
Uncle. Very well. Now suppose this history
should last for three tlhousand years from this time.
Suppose the English language in which it is written should cease to be spoken. And suppose that
certain people on the other side of the globe, for
example in China, should by some means get a
copy of this same Life of Washington; do you
think they would receive as much pleasure from it
as you now receive?
Ernest. 0 no! certainly not.
Uncle. And why not.?
Ernest. Because they would not be able to un
derstand English.
Uncle. But suppose some very learned man
should translate it into Chinese; do you think the
1751AN INTRODUCTION
youth of China would take as much pleasure in it
as you do in the original?
Hilary. I do not know. It is a thing I never
thought of before.
Ernest. No, sir; they would find it hard to
know what it meant; and I imagine they could not
feel much interest in it.
Uncle. What difficulty would they have in understanding it, supposing it were in their own language?
Ernest. Why, perhaps they would not know
any thing about America, and the history is almost
all about things in America. When they read about
the battles of Yorktown, and Princeton, and Trenton, they would not know where these places were,
or how far they were from one another.
Uncle. Exactly so; and the only way to comprehend these things would be, to give them some
idea of American geography. Now do you not
suppose that there are many readers of the English
Bible, who know quite as little about the geography of Palestine and other eastern countries?
Ernest. No doubt there are many such. I am
afraid I am one of the sort myself; for in reading
the Bible, I find myself often at a loss to knoxw
where the events which are related took place.
Uncle. Now you have come exactly to the place
whither I was leading you. I like to make you
176TO THE SCRIPTURES.
teach yourself. Impress this point on your mind,
that Sacred Geography is of the utmost importance,
in order to render the Scriptures either plain or
profitable. This is the first thing we have learned
this evening.
Many persons read the Bible, year after year,
without ever taking the trouble to inquire whereabout the places mentioned in it are situated. Yet
there are numerous passages which have little
meaning to one who does not attend to the geography; and other passages which have peculiar
beauty when we have the whole position of the
scene in our minds.
Ernest. Please to mention one or two of these.
Uncle. I will give you an example of the advantages of biblical geography. You have often
read the account of the journeyings of the Israelites.
Ernest. 0 yes! They travelled from Egypt
into Canaan.
Hilary. Yes, and they were forty years making
this journey.
Uncle. Now did you ever take notice of the
direction in which they travelled?
Ernest. Let me consider. Egypt lies southwest of Canaan. Indeed, I never thought much
about it, but I suppose they must have travelled
towards the northeast.
Uncle. And how far was it from the northeast
I77AN INTRODUCTION
before daylight, in order to get ready. Their trunks
were packed, and their great-coats spread out. The
young travellers could scarcely be content to wait
for the carriage. At length it came to the door;
there was much shaking of hands, and abundance
of messages and good wishes, and then the carriage
drove off. The ground was covered with a light
snow, and the sleet of the preceding night had settled in a glassy coat upon the trees and shrubs.
When the sun shone out, the whole country glistened, as if every icicle had been a crystal or a precious stone.
The journey need not be described. It was
like most journeys in which boys are concerned
Ernest was stretching his neck one way, and Hilary
was stretching his neck another way, both eager to
see every thing, and both delighted at every thing
they saw. Hilary talked most and laughed most;
but Ernest looked wise, as if he were ashamed to
admire any thing too much. They were glad when
they found tlhey were drawing near to Oakdale.
"There! there it is!" cried Ernest. "Look
out, Hilary! Look out! There is uncle's barn;
there is the little brook, and the bridge over it;
there is the row of oaks; and now I see the house;
and the green cedars before the door! And, O!
there is good uncle Austin himself, with his blue
cloak on, waiting for us, and his staff in his hand."
16AN INTRODUCTION
part of Egypt to the part of Canaan which they
first entered?
Ernest. I never thought of the distance.
Uncle. I will show you. Look at this little
map. Here is a view of the track of the Israelites.
Instead of going directly towards the northeast, you
see they made a great circuit.
First they went southeast to the Red Sea. Then
they pursued their way still more towards the south,
along one branch of the Red Sea. Then they turned
towards the north by Mount Sinai, through the
Desert of Paran. Then to the northeast, until they
approached the southern part of Palestine. Here
they might have entered; but the Lord caused them
to turn directly back, and journey southward again,
by Mount Hor, to the point of the eastern branch
of the Red Sea. Then they turned northward once
more, and pursued that general direction until they
came to their journey's end.
Ernest. And this is the reason why they were
so long in making the journey?
Uncle. Yes. At some of these places they were
made to remain months, and perhaps years. Much
of the time they were wandering about in the wilderness. So that they were forty years in accomplishing a journey which they miglht otherwise
have accomplished in forty days.
Ernest. I have often thought, in reading the
178TO THE SCRIPTURES.
history of the apostle Paul, that I should be very
glad to have a map in which I could see the course
which he took in his voyages and travels.
Uncle. There are many such maps; and I have
several in which there are lines showing how he
went from place to place in his five principal journeys. One of these maps has each of these tracks
marked with a distinct colour, which prevents all
confusion.* I would advise you, whenever you
study the Scriptures, to have at hand good maps of
all the places named; and also a plan of the city
of Jerusalem, such as you see over the fireplace. Examine these carefully; seek out all the
principal places; and by degrees you will get these
so fixed in your mind, that you will scarcely need
your maps any more.
Ernest. I see very plainly that a knowledge of
the places mentioned in Scripture is very necessarv.
Uncle. Perhaps I may find time to speak more
largely on this subject. At present, it is sufficient
to repeat what I just said, that you ought to make
it a point to learn where every place lies, concerning which you read in the Bible. This can be acquired with less labour and in less time than you
0 Maps of this kind are published by the American Sunday-school Union.
179AN INTRODUCTION
now suppose. The knowledge of biblical geography will make many dark places clear. It will
enable you to accompany the personages in sacred
history in all their travels; and, besides adding te
your delight in the word of God, will fix what you
read in your memory.
But let me return to the supposition about the
Chinese version of Washington's Life. Suppose
some young mandarin in the city of Nankin should
be busily engaged in the perusal of this volume,
and suppose likewise, that by the help of some missionary he had been able to acquire a little notion
of American geography, would every thing then
become plain?
Hilary. I imagine many things might be a great
deal plainer than they could have been before, but
still he might not be able to tell exactly when all
these events happened. Uncle, am I not right?
Uncle. You are, my dear boy. And this knowledge of when such and such things happened,
is precisely the thing I wish you to consider. This
knowledge of the time when events took place
is what is called Chronology. Chronology teaches
the times when all great historical facts occurred.
Sacred chronology, or biblical chronology, teaches
the times when those events which the Bible relates occurred.
Ernest. So we have another important thing to
learn, besides gecgraphy.
ISOTO THE SCRIPTURES.
Uncle. Yes. Fix it well in your mind; that
biblical chronology is of-great importance in order
to render the Scriptures either plain or profitable.
This is the second thing we have learned this
evening.
When I was a boy, I read much in the Bible,
and finding the book of Matthew placed immediately after the book of Malachi, that is, finding
the New Testament beginning just where the Old
Testament ends, I never dreamed that there was a,
period of more than four hundred years between
the writing of these two books.
Hilary. Four hundred years! Can it be possible?
Uncle. It is truly so. And during this period,
some most important events took place. But I cannot dwell on these at present. I will take another
example. How many years is it since Jesus
Christ was born?
Hilaryzr. Eighteen hundred and thirty-eight.
Uncle. Very well: so it is, according to the
common reckoning. Now, would it not help you
to understand the gospel, if you knew exactly how
long this was after the creation-how many years
before Jerusalem was destroyed-how many years
after the great city of Rome was built?  Also,
would it not be very pleasant to know what was
happening in other parts of the world at this very'
16
181AN INTRODUCTION
time--what kings were reigning-what great generals were alive-who were the learned men-and
the like?
Ernest. 0, I see at once how much good this
would do, though I never thought of it before.
Uncle. Very well. Chronologers have made
lists of all great events, putting down the times
when they occurred. These lists are called chronological tables. Some of them are so large as to
fill great volumes. Others are smaller, and record
only the principal events; and some are made still
smaller, so as to give only what is necessary fot
the understanding of the Bible.
If you look at this large chronological map oi
table, you will perceive several interesting particulars about the time of our Lord's incarnation. For
example, Christ was born seven hundred and fiftythree years after the building of Rome; seventy
years before the destruction of Jerusalem.
At this time, Augustus had been reigning more
than twenty-six years as Roman emperor. Virgil
had been dead fourteen years, Horace three years,
IJivy and Ovid were still alive. The Romans were
at peace with all nations, and continued so for about
three years. All this is interesting, and I might
tell you many more things which were remarkable
at that very time. All this is to be found in books
of chronology.
82TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Milary. But must we read through all these
great, dry volumes?
Uncle. I hope, before long we shall have some
pleastnt tables of chronology, prepared for the use
of Bible scholars. But our common Bibles give
us much assistance on these very points. I have
frequently told you how desirable it is to read the
Scriptures in an edition that has every thingin it
which the excellent translators furnished, namely,
the marginal notes and readings, the references,
and the dates. These dates answer the purpose
-of a chronological table. Open the Bible which
lies on the stand, and tell me what edition it is.
Ernest. It is a stereotype edition, printed at
New York, for the American Bible Society, in the
year 1834.
Uncle. Look at the bottom of the title-page on

Ernest. I see them; they are these, 12mo. ref.
Uncle. That means duodecimo Reference Bible.
It is an excellent Bible for those whose eyes are
good. For elderly people there is a larger one, of
the size called octavo; and another still larger, of
the size called quarto. All these are exactly alike
except in size and shape. Now look at the top
of the middle column, and you will observe the

you, and I will take care to observe these whenevel
I read.
Uncle. But now I have still another question to
propose. If the young Chinese scholar were well
informed as to the part of the world where Washington lived, and the exact time of his birth and
death; do you think this would remove all difficulties in reading the history? In other words, would
he be likely to understand the book as well as one
relating to hlis own country?
Ernest. I think not. There would still be one
difficulty. I scarcely know how to express myself; but every thing in this country is so different
from what it would be China, that I think he would
be at some loss to know what the book meant.
Uncle. Explain yourself more fully.
Ernest. I mean this; our dress is different from
that of China. The young Chinese would not understand the names of our garments. Our houses
and roads are different; our religion is different;
and our government is different; so that I do not
see how he could perfectly understand the book
without information on these subjects.
Uncle. You have discovered exactly what I
meant. In order to understand any work, it is
necessary that we should be acquainted with the
manners and customs of the people to whom it
relates. Now observe, the books which compose
184TO THE SCRIPTURES.
the Bible were written some centuries ago; and
they relate to a people whose manner of life was
exceedingly unlike our own. The inhabitants of
the East differ greatly in their manners from the
people of Europe and America; and every book
In the Bible abounds in allusions to these peculiarities. In order to arrive at what the Scriptures
mean, we must therefore make ourselves acquainted
with the particulars in which the life and habits of
the Orientals vary from our own. This is called
Oriental Antiquities; or, with reference to the Bible, Biblical fntiquities. In our next conversation, I will give you a number of interesting facts
on this subject.
Before we separate for the evening, let me see
whether you remember what I have been teaching
you. I have mentioned to you three things, the
knowledge of which is necessary in order to the
intelligent study of the Scriptures. What are these
three things?
Hilary. First, Biblical Geography.
Secondly, Biblical Chlronology.
Thirdly, Biblical./ntiquities.
Uncle. Very well answered. And now we shall
prepare for our evening worship, for I suppose you
begin to think of going to rest.

THE little boys remembered the promise of their
uncle, that in the next conversation he would proceed to give them some interesting particulars about
the customs of the East. They hastened into his
study the next morning at an earlier hour than
usual, to remind him of his engagement, and were
received by him with a smiling countenance. His
large table was covered with heavy books, pictures,
and a number of curiosities which looked as if they
had come out of a museum. Ernest and Hilary
seated themselves near the cheerful fire, and the
good old gentleman began thus:
Uncle. I am now about to tell you a number of
things which will be very entertaining; and which
relate to the antiquities of the Hebrews. I have
on this table several books written by learned men
who have travelled in the Holy Land and other
eastern countries.  Here are likewise a number
of large plates which will give you a good idea of
many objects spoken of in Scripture; and besides,
186TO THE SCRIPTURES.
several of the real things, which you shall presently
have in your hands.
Hilary. 0 that will be delightful!
Uncle. Observe it is not my purpose merely to
amuse you, but to impress on your minds this
principle, that a knowledge of the manners and
customs of the East throws great light upon the
Scriptures.
Every nation has its own manners and customs,
differing more or less from those of all other nations. Those people who live furthest apart are
generally most unlike. The inhabitants of a very
warm climate are very different from those of a
cold climate. The habits and practices of the same
people greatly vary during the course of one or two
thousand years. We should, therefore, expect to
find the people mentioned in the Bible differing
in many important respects from ourselves. I am
about to mention a few of these differences; it
would take me weeks to mention them all. Books
of travels and works on antiquities will teach you
all that is necessary for you to know. Bear this
always in mind when you are reading the Scriptures, that you must, as far as possible, forget the
peculiarities of our own time and nation, and try
to feel as if you were Hebrews.
Hilary. I suppose they never had such cold
weather as this in Judea.
187TO THE SCRIPTURES.
The carriage stopped. The step was let down.
The door was opened; Ernest stepped out. The
good old man cried, " Welcome, welcome, nephew!"
and, taking Ernest in his arms, he kissed his forehead. " And this is my nephew Hilary? I must
take you in my old arms too. But come in, Hilary-come in, Ernest-the day is cold-the parlour
is all warm for you, and every one glad to see you,
even down to Hylax the dog."
Old John, the gardener, took in the luggage;
and uncle Austin led the way into the house. Miss
Priscilla More, his niece, was standing there to
receive her cousins. They found a bright country
fire, roaring in a large, old-fashioned hearth. A
high arm-chair was before it. In this the old gentleman seated himself, and then pointed to a low
chair on his right, and another on his left: " There
are your seats, my lads," said he, cheerfully;
"Ernest, sit on my right; Hilary, sit on my left:
now be as happy as you can."
By the time the boys had got well warmed, and
somewhat rested, they were called into the next
room to dinner. The young travellers sat down
with good appetites, and I must confess that Hilary
thought more highly of Oakdale than he had ever
done, when he saw the bountiful provision which
had been made by his cousin Priscilla. During
the meal, uncle Austin looked very attentively at
17AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. Not for any length of time. Although
the nights are often cold, yet snow and ice are very
rare. It may be called a hot climate. The part of
the land which lies on the Mediterranean is often
fanned with cooling breezes; and there is a refreshing atmosphere upon the mountains; but in the vale
of Jordan, and other inland parts, it is often excessively hot. In our climate, we never call foretell
when it will rain; but in Palestine the rain falls
periodically. They have what they call the former
and the latter rain, and these last for many days together. They are sometimes so severe as to beat
down the houses of the poor, which are often made
of palm branches, mud, and tiles, dried in the sun.
Ernest. That puts me in mind of what our Saviour says: "And the rains descended, and the
floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
that house, and it fell, and great was the fall
thereof." ~
Uncle. Very true; and thus you see how the
knowledge of this fact explains the text. But
there are a thousand such cases.
Hilary. Be so good as to mention a few of the
things in which we differ from the Hebrews.
Uncle. That is what I propose to do. In the
first place, our way of living is very unlike their's
* Matt. vii. 27.
188TO THE SCRIPTURES.
1S9
We live altogether in solid houses, of brick, stone,
or strong wood. The Hebrews, in many cases,
dwelt in tents, as the Arabs do to this day.
Hilary. But had they no houses?
Uncle. 0 yes; but their houses differed very
much from  ours. There are very few   wooden
houses in these countries, because forest trees are
scarce. There are scarcely any houses of' three
stories, and( few of more than one. The outside
of their houses is very plain, often unsightly, and
on the side next the street there are few windows,
and often none at all.
In America, all our dwellings have sloping roofs;
but the Hebrews had flat roofs. They spent much
of their time on these roofs, which were sometimes
covered with clay. There were little walls or
parapets to keep any one from falling off. In our
houses, the only way of getting to the roof is
through the inside of the building; but the Hebrew
lhouses often had stairs on the outside leading to
the housetop. And this way explains what our
Lord means when he says, " Let him which is on
the housetop not come down to take any thing out
of his house."-   The Hebrews used to sleep
during a great part of the year on these flat roofs.
The Arabs and Syrians do so still. Dr. Pococke,
* Matt. xxiv. 17.190           AN INTRODUCTION
(who wrote this large work,) tells us, that " when
he was at Tiberias in Galilee, he was entertained
by the sheik's (or governor's) steward, and that
they supped on the top of the house for coolness,
according to their custom, and lodged there likewise, in a sort of closet, about eight feet square, of
a wicker work, plastered round toward the bottom,
but without any door, each person having his cell."
This was in the month of May.
In our houses we have fire-places and chimneys;
the Hebrews had nothing of the sort. Neither had
they any thing like our glass windows. AnotherTO THE SCRIPTURES.
peculiarity in the eastern houses is, that they generally have a considerable space in the middle of
them, which is open at the top. This is called the
inner court. In the centre of this, rich persons
sometimes had one or more fountains playing, as
seen in the engraving.
Ernest. All this would seem very strange to us;
yet I remember several things in the Scriptures
which this explains.
Uncle. Moreover, when you enter an eastern
house, you find every thing very unlike what you
are accustomed to. We usually take three meals
a day, the Hebrews took but two. We sit upon
chairs around a table. The Orientals, properly
speaking, have neither chair nor table. They sit
on the floor, or on a mat, cushion, or very low
seat, and have the food placed near them in trays
or on boards. We use knives and forks. The Hebrews used neither, but thrust their hands into the
dish, and pulled the meat apart with their fingers.
Ililary. This does not seem to me to be very
cleanly.
Uncle. You must remember that the Orientals
keep their hands exceedingly clean. Besides their
other ablutions, they carefully wash their hands
before and after every meal.
Ernest. But do not the eastern people make
any use of chairs?
191AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. No.   The rooms of those who are
wealthy are furnished with costly carpets or mats,
and on these they sit down cross-legged. But
along the wall of the room, there is frequently
a little stage or platform, raised a few inches, or
perhaps a foot or two, and here they have theil
beds; here they also sometimes sit or recline during
the day. This is called the divan. The most
honourable place is in the corner.
Ernest. But I think I have been told that the
ancients used to lie down at their meals.
Uncle. In early times the Hebrews did not
practise this method, but it certainly was in use at
the time of our Saviour's minlistry, and was probably borrowed from the Greeks and Romans. The
early Greeks and Romans used to sit at their meals,
but after they became more luxurious they introduced this way of reclining at table. In a beautiful
picture under article Feast, in the UNION BIBLE
DICTIONARY, YOU have the representation of a Roman
company reclining at a feast. You will see many
of them have their heads adorned with wreaths,
which was customary when they drank wine.
You will also see gladiators, or swordsmen, fighting
for the amusement of the company; a cruel entertainment practised among the Romans. The Jews
in our Saviour's time, following this example, used
to lie on long couches, like sofas, when they ate.
192TO THE SCRIPTURES.
These couches were covered with soft cushions
and pillows. They lay on the left side, and in
eating used only the right hand. As they thus lay
around the table, their feet would of course extend
back from it, so that a person might go around the
company, and touch the feet of every one at the
table. In this way, the woman in the gospel came
behind and washred our Lord's feet with her tears.
When they reclined near to one another, one person often leaned on the bosom of the next. In this
way the beloved disciple leaned upon the bosom of
Christ. But you will comprehend this whole subject better by means of a picture which you will
find under article Eat in the UNION BIBLE DICTIONARY. There you will plainly see how the feet of
any guest might be approached; and also how any
person, reclining near one of the corners, might be
said to lie in the bosom of the next one.
Ernest. I have observed in reading the Bible
that the dress of the eastern people is very different
from ours.
Uncle. Yes, so much so that there are many
passages of Scripture which it is scarcely possible
to understand without a knowledge of the ancient
oriental apparel. The dress of those countries is
adapted to a warm climate; and it is observed that
they do not change their fashions every few months,
17
193AN INTRODUCTION
as we do, but wear very much the same sort of
clothes from age to age.
We are accustomed to see people clothed in garments which are cut rather tight, so as to show the
shape; but the Hebrews were more fond of flowing robes, for men as well as women. We wear
hats, but the Orientals wear turbans, or other headdresses of cloth. We are careful to shave off our
beards; the Hebrews cherished the beard as their
greatest ornament and honour. We cover our feet
with stockings, shoes, and boots; the Hebrews
went barefoot, or used light sandals; in no case
making use of stockings. The eastern women are
not content with ear-rings, but wear precious rings
in the nose also. They colour ttheir eyelids and
their nails, and have ornaments upon their wrists
and ankles.
Ernest. We read a great deal about the girdle;
what was it like?
Uncle. As the garments of the Hebrews hung
about them in a loose and flowing manner, they
needed some sort of band or belt to keep them in
place. This was the girdle. In the house this
was seldom necessary, but when they were at work,
or on a journey, or going to battle, their long robes
would have been a great hinderance, unless they
were tucked up and secured by this band.
Whenever a man was in -great haste or activity,
194TO THE SCRIPTURES.
he fastened the girdle closely around his body; this
was called " girding up the loins." So when Elijah predicted the rain, he "girded up his loins
and ran before Ahab."* And when our Saviour
was about to wash the feet of his disciples, " he
took a towel and girded himself."t
Hence girding the loins came to be used to meail
preparation for active service. Thus Christ says
to his disciples, "let your loins be girt about, and
your lights burning;":t that is, be in a state of constant preparation.
Hilary. There is a verse in the gospel of Matthew which I never could understand, and I wish
you would explain it to me. It is said, " Neitller
do men put new wine into old bottles; else the
bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the
bottles perish: but they put new wine into new
bottles, and both are preserved."~ I never could
see why an old bottle should break because it had
new wine in it.
Uncle. Here is a case that shows how necessary
it is to have some knowledge of eastern customs.
If the bottles meant were of glass or earth, such as
we use, the text would be without meaning; and
some ignorant infidels have ridiculed it as being
* 1 Kings xviii. 46.    t John xiii. 4.
$ Luke xii. 36.          ~ Matt. ix. 17.
195AN INTRODUCTION
absurd. But.the Hebrews used a sort of bottle
with which we have no acquaintance; their bottles
were of skins.
Hilary. Of skins! I never heard of such a thing.
Uncle. It is nevertheless true; and the eastern
people use the same in our day. They prepare
the skin of a kid or goat in such a way as to make
it hold liquids, and find them very convenient.
Let me read you a passage from the travels of Sir
John Chardin.
" They put into these goat and kid skin vessels
every thing which they want to carry to a distance
in the East, whether dry or liquid, and very rarely
make use of boxes and pots, unless it be to preserve such things as are liable to be broken. The
reason is, their making use of beasts of carriage for
conveying these things, who often fall down under
their loading, or throw it down; and also because
it is in pretty thin woollen sacks that they enclose
what they carry. There is another advantage, too.
in putting the necessaries of life in these skin ves.
sels; they are preserved fresher."
I will now show you a little picture from
the Antiquities of Herculaneum. Here you see a
woman pouring wine into a cup from just such a
bottle. You may perceive that after the ski-n has
been taken from the animal, and suitably dressed,
the places where the legs were have been stopped

up. This cut will give you a better idea of an
ancient bottle than any description of mine.
This will enable you to understand another passage which occurs in the book of Joshua. You
remember that when the Israelites were destroying
the nations of Canaan, the-people of Gibeon came
to Joshua, and pretended that they lived at a much
greater distance than the others. They came with
old tattered clothes, "and wine-bottles, old and
rent, and bound up."* Now a person ignorant of
what I have been telling you could not comprehend
how a bottle could be torn, or bound up; but all
this is very intelligible when you learn that these
bottles were made, not of glass, but of skin.
Hilary. But still, uncle, I do not see why the

his nephews, and smiled with pleasure when he
saw how well they behaved themselves. After
dinner, they returned to the warm parlour, and
drew their chairs again around the fire. Uncle
Austin leaned back in his chair, and began as follows:
"I have been thinking how rapidly time flies.
It seems but a little while since I used to go to my
grandfather's, to spend my winter holidays. And
now I am old enough to be your grandfather."
Hilary said, "Uncle Austin, how old would
your grandfather be, if he were living now?"
" O0, my child, he would be the oldest man on
earth; for he was very old then, and it was sixty
years ago; he would be a hundred and fifty years
old."
"That is not as old by twenty-five years as
Abraham was," said Ernest.
"I am glad you know so much about Abraham,
nephew. Men lived to be older in those days.
Pray, master Hilary, how old was Enoch when he
died?"
Hilary smiled, and said, "Just as old, sir, as
Elijah was."
"Well done!" said uncle Austin. "I thought
I had caught you: but you have looked a little into
the best of books. It is well that you do. As for
me, I began too late. When I was of your age,AN. INTRODUCTION
putting of new wine into an old skin should
break it.
Uncle. Let me explain this. When wine is new
it ferments, and every fermenting liquor swells,
and requires more room. This is what causes so
many porter-bottles to burst. Now if this new
wine be put into a fresh, new skin, which is soft
and flexible, the skin will yield and stretch as the
liquor swells with fermentation, and no injury will
be done. But if the same lively liquor be put into
bottles of old skins, which have become dry and
stiffened, they will not be able to stretch and make
room, but will crack and burst, and let the wine
run out.
Ernest. 0, how plain that makes it! I am determined to read a great deal more about Hebrew
customs. I had no idea that it was so entertaining.
Uncle. Indeed there are few studies so truly
amusing as well as instructive. Besides, you may
be pursuing these inquiries all your life. I never
meet with a new book of travels in the East which
does not add something to my knowledge of the
Bible.
I will now ask you a question or two: What
does the psalmist mean when he says, lam betome
as a bottle in t/Ie smoke.?
* Ps. cxix. 83.
198TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Ernest. I suppose he means that he was withered and wriIlkled by care and distress, just as a
goat-skin bottle is drawn up and injured by being
smoked.
Uncle. Very well: here is another question.
David addresses God, in prayer, thus: Put thou
my tears into thy bottle.* What does this mean?
Ernest. I confess I have no idea.
Hilary. Nor I.
Uncle. The allusion here is to a very singular
custom of the ancients. We are not well informed
of what the Hebrews did, but the Greeks and Romans, when they wept for the death of any dear
friend, used to catch the tears in little phials, and
offer them upon the tomb of the deceased. These
were called lacrymatories, or tear-vessels.  In
opening tombs in Italy many of these lacrymatories
have been found. I remember to have seen several
in Peale's Museum at Philadelphia; and I have
examined pictures of a great many. They were
made sometimes of baked earth, sometimes of glass,
and sometimes of precious stones, such as agate or
sardonyx. The meaning, therefore, of the psalmist's prayer is,' Remember my griefs, as the tears
of mourners are preserved.'
I will now show you cuts of two Roman lacry
matories, found near Naples.

Hilary. They seem to have had very strange
customs at their funerals.
Uncle. Yes, the ancient methods of showing grief
were very different from ours, and far more violent.
Every eastern funeral is attended by a great number
of women, who fill the air with shrieks and wailings. Sometimes persons are hired for this purpose. Every passenger who goes along thinks it
meritorious to join in these lamentations. Perhaps
this may explain a text in Jeremiah: " Call for the
mourining women, that they may come;........
and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for
us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and
our eyelids gush out with waters."*
Ernest. There is something like this in the Gos* Jer. ix. 17, 19.TO THE SCRIPTURES.
pels, where Christ went to bring to life the daughter of a certain ruler. When he came into the
house, he " saw the minstrels and the people making a noise."  But what were the minstrels?
Uncle. The word translated minstrels signifies
players on the flute or pipe. These were employed at funerals, to play mournful tunes. Josephus tells us of a great mourning at which "many
hired pipers led the way in the wailings."t
Hilary. While you are talking about Hebrew
customs, I beg you will explain to me one word
which has always perplexed me very much. Our
Saviour says of the Pharisees: "They make broad
their phylacteries."T
I do not know the meanlag of this word.
Uncle. This word occurs only in this one text.
It means a preservative, or amulet, and the thing
was used by the superstitious Jews to protect them
from evil. The phylacteries were little boxes or
rolls of parchment which they wore about their
persons; sometimes on their foreheads, and sometimes on their wrists. These little articles had
texts of the law written on them; especially four
passages.~
# Matt. ix. 23.       t Josephus' Wars, book iii.: Matt. xxiii.
~ Ex. xiii. 2-10; 11-16. Deut. vi. 1-9; xi. 13-21.
201AN INTRODUCTION
Hilary. Why did they wear these texts on their
persons?
Uncle. In this, as in innumerable instances, they
unwisely took the commands of the law in their
most literal signification. You may remember that
the Lord had spoken thus to them: " And it shall
be for a sign upon thy hand, and for a memorial
between thine eyes:"* and again, " Thou shalt bind
them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be
as frontlets between thine eyes."t In consequence
of misunderstanding these texts, the Pharisees
actually fastened fragments of the law upon their
bodies. They were written on little pieces of
parchment, which were rolled up, or enclosed in
small square boxes, both being tied on with strings.
You will have a good idea of them by looking ai
the engraving under article Phylacteries in UNION
BIBLE DICTIONARY. Those Pharisees who wished
to make a great show of their religion used to weai
these hypocritical ornaments very large; and it
was this which our Saviour intended to rebuke
For the reverence which we ought to feel for the
word of God, is not to be displayed by wearing
parts of it on our face and hands; but by loving it,
studying it, and conforming ourselves to its holy
contents.

I hope I have now said enough to show you the
great importance of being acquainted with biblical
antiquities. It is a delightful study, and a number
of books have been published, which contain all
the facts which it is necessary for you to know.
These you may read as you grow older.
Ernest. My dear uncle, we have now been here
more [han three weeks, and in a few days we shall
have to return to New York. I have been thinking how pleasant it would be, if you would give us
a few directions for reading the Scriptures. These
would be very useful to us, when we are at home.

my own mind, and I have actually prepared a
paper containing a number of directions, which
you and Hilary may copy, and take home with

AFTER having spent most of the day in active

took a paper from his desk, and putting on his

it will serve to fix them in your memories.

book in the world which has come directly from
God. Holy men of old wrote these things by the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Do you not remember a text which teaches this?
Hilary. Yes, sir. "All Scripture is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."
Uncle. Therefore you must not read the Scriptures as you read other books, but with great reverence and sacred awe. It is a message from
God. If God should send you a message from
heaven by the hand of any man, would you not receive it with great solemnity?
Hilary. I think I should tremble with fear.
Uncle. No doubt; an'd such should be our awe
in approaching the Scriptures. They are messages
from heaven. If Jesus Christ should write you a
letter, with his own hand, how would you feel
when you received it?
Ernest. We should be almost afraid to open it;
but we should also be very desirous to know what
it contained.

again: you would preserve it with the greatest
care: and you would believe every word of it. So

also, if you were invited to go to a certain place
where you might hear God speaking to you from
heaven, you would lay aside every careless thought,
and listen with profound attention. Now we do
really hear God speaking to us in the Holy Scriptures. Keep this always in mind. This direction
is the most important of all I have to give you;
indeed, it is the foundation of all the rest. Whenever you take this blessed volume into your hands,
say to yourselves: "This is God's book: I uiill
hear what God the Lord will speak."e
Ernest. That reminds me of what I have read
in the History of England, about that pious young
king, Edward the Sixth. He was once playing
with some of his companions, and wished to take
down something from a shelf above his reach. One
of his playfellows offered him a large book to stand
upon; but when King Edward perceived it to
be a Bible, he refused to use it in that way;
and said, it was not proper that he should trample
under his feet that which he ought to treasure up
in his head and heart.
Uncle. This was very well said. Let us be
careful, however, to reverence not the mere outside
of the book, but its inspired contents. I will now
proceed.

PRAY FOR DIY1VNE AID AND ILLUMINATION.
The Bible contains many things which are mysterious, and which we could never have found out
for ourselves. We need the assistance of God's
Holy Spirit to make these things plain to us. Our
sins darken our minds, so that we are liable to
make mistakes in religious things; and some of
these mistakes are so great that they may even
ruin the soul. David often prays for this divine
illumination; especially in the longest psalm in the
Bible. Can either of you tell me which that is?
Hilary. It is the hundred and ninteenth.
Uncle. I'rue. David there prays: "Open thou
mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out
of thy law."  And this is a suitable petition for
us, whenever we open the Bible. Again, " Make
me to understand thy precepts: so shall I talk of
thy wondrous works."  "Teach me, 0 Lord, the
way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the
end."
Without the assistance of God we cannot comprehend spiritual things. Thus it is said: " The
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither

there was no such thing as a Sunday-school, and
very few books to explain the Bible. When we
wanted to read, we used to get little gilt books from
Mr. Newberry, of St. Paul's Churchyard, London.
We had Jack the Giant-killer, Guy of Warwick,
and the Seven Sleepers. But I cared little for
reading of any kind. My delight was to ride, and
shout, and frolic. And when I began to read the
Bible some years after, it was quite a strange book
to me."
Ernest. Uncle, how old were you when you
went to France?
Uncle. I have been several times to France, my
boy. The first time I was twenty-three years old,
and then I travelled all over Europe; but the time
I stayed longest in France was when I was about
forty years of age. And now I am content to remain here, and lay my bones in America.
Hilary. But, uncle, we never see you in the
city. You must get very tired of staying alwayb
here in this lonely place.
Uncle. Not at all, Hilary. There you make a
boyish mistake. I dare say you think that nobody
can be happy unless he lives in New York, and
walks in Broadway, and sees abundance of fine
stores, and fine people, and fine ships. You fancy
that I am lonesome. Now let me tell you, I am
happier here in my quiet Oakdale, than many a

cerned.":
Pray, my dear children, that the Lord would
take away this darkness of your minds. The
teaching of the Holy Spirit will do more to explain
to you the meaning of the Scriptures, than the best
human teachers. In this way some very poor men.
who were ignorant of human science. have become
wonderfully instructed in the things of God.
Ernest. Do you mean that we ought to pray
every time we are going to read in the Bible?
Uncle. I do not mean that you should actually
go down upon your knees, every time you begin
to read; although there would be nothing wrong
in this. But whenever you open the Scriptures,
it would be well for you to lift up your heart to
God in prayer, that he would enlighten your
mind. This you should likewise frequently do in
the midst of your reading; and when you close the
book, you should, in the same manner, beg that the
Holy Spirit would impress on your heart what you
have learned.
Direction III.
READ WITH PATIENCE AND SELF-DENIAL.
Ernest. What do you mean by reading with
patience?
* 1 Cor. ii. 14.
208TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Uncle. By this I mean that you should not
allow yourself to grow weary, so as to hurry over
what you read, or lay the book aside. This is an
important rule, particularly for youth; who are
willing enough to read for a little while, but are
glad to close the volume, and turn to something else.
Besides this, you may observe that some young
persons begin to study the Scriptures, and continue
to do so regularly for a few weeks or months; but
at the end of a short period their perseverance fails,
and they neglect it altogether.  You must not
grow weary of the word of God. You must not
read by fits and starts. You must not allow any
thing to draw you away from the habit of constantly studying it.
Ernest. What do you mean by reading with
se,f-denial.
Uncle. Self-denial means going against our own
wishes for the sake of duty. To deny ourselves
is to do what is not agreeable to us, when we are
convinced that it is our duty; or to keep from enjoying any thing which we may like, when we are
convinced that it would be wrong. Sometimes it may
be the case, that when the time comes which you
have set for reading the Scriptures, you may be in
company, or at play, or reading some other book.
Now you must exercise self-denial by giving up
1 8*
209AN INTRODUCTION
these worldly enjoyments for the sake of the Scriptures. Or, while you are actually reading, you
may be tempted to leave off, for some other employment, or for some amusement. Here vou
must exercise self-denial, by persevering in the
study of the Scriptures.
Hilary. But what are we to do, if we become
very weary or sleepy? Must we read on?
Uncle. I thlink not. What we do under great
weariness or drowsiness is not usually very profitable. In such a case, I should advise you to lay
the book aside; always taking care, however, to
make up what you have thus lost, at the earliest
opportunity.
Direction IV.
READ THE SCRIPTURES WITH UNBROKEN ATTENTION.
Now do you understand this direction?
Hilary. It means that we must not be thinking
of other things while we read.
Uncle. Yes, this is part of what is meant. Some
people fall into a habit of reading so carelessly, that
they do not get a single idea from the words in the
book. They read as if they were asleep. Make
them close the book, and tell what the subject is,
and they are absolutely dumb. The danger is
greatest in books with which we are very familiar.
210TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Did you never observe that when you have pe.
rused the same page a great many times, you have
caulght yourselves repeating the words without
thinking of what they mean?
Hilary. 0 yes, sir! For when I commit a
speech to memory, to declaim it at school, I often
say it all over without once thinking what it is
about.
Ernest. And I have often taken notice, in repeating the Lord's prayer, that I go over the whole
while I am thinking of something else; because I
am so familiar with the words.
Uncle. This is just the fault I wish you to avoid
in reading the Bible. Read with attention. Endeavour to think closely of every thing you read.
And besides this, let your attention be unbroken.
I have known a person to begin to read with great
seriousness; but if he saw a bird near the window,
or heard the voice of a playmate, or even thought
of some favourite sport, his mind would be away
in a moment; his attention would be broken.
Guard against this wandering of thought. It is a
great evil in all study, but chiefly in the study of
the Scriptures.
Ernest. I acknowledge that I am guilty of this
fault every day; but I hope I shall endeavour to
avoid it.
211'AN INTRlODUC TION
Direction V.
ENDEAVOUR TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW FRODM
EVERY VERSE BEFORE YOU LEAVE IT.
Hilary. Uncle, this seems to me to be a strange
rule.
Uncle. How so, my child?
Hilary. Why, sir, if I really know what a verse
means, how can I get any more from it?
Uncle. My dear boy, the Bible is a book very
rich in meaning. I have read it over many, many
times; and yet there is no passage in which, with
proper attention, I cannot find something new.
But you are to consider that we often read many
verses together, without getting any meaning
whatever. We have been so accustomed to the
words of Scripture, having read them from our
early childhood, that we feel satisfied to go over
the language without learning any thing more about
the sense.
I was led to lay down this rule for myself; from
observing that I derived least profit from those parts
of Scripture with which I was best acquainted.
Thus, I often perused the Sermon on the Mount,
with scarce a thought about its delightful contents.
I therefore determined, that in my stated reading
of the Scriptures, I would pause a little upon each
verse, and not leave it until, if possible, I had
212TO THE SCRIPTURES.
learned from it something which did not strike me
on the first perusal.
Ernest. But, uncle, it will take one a great while
to get through the Bible, at this rate.
Uncle. Even if it should, it would be far more
profitable than the ordinary way. But this direction applies only to the stated and regular study of
the Scriptures; and I shall show you that sometimes it is desirable to read large portions together
in a more rapid and cursory manner. Besides,
you must know that thoughts move very quickly;
we may have a number of thoughts in a second of
time; and therefore the delay need not be so great
as you suppose.'IThere is moreover such a fulness
of truth and meaning in the blessed Bible, that no
man can ever say, in this world, of any one passage, that he has made himself master of all it
teaches.
Ernest. Well, I begin to see more reason in the
direction; and shall make trial of it.
Direction VI.
EXERCISE FAITH ON ALL THAT YOU READ.
Faith is belief. We have faith in that which we
truly, and from the heart, believe. Ought we not
to believe every word that is in the Bible?
Ernest. Yes, because every word is true. We
should believe every word that God says.
213AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. Remember the words of the apostle John,
"If we receive the witness of men, thle witness of
God is greater."" It is not enough to hear or read
the word of God; we must believe it. According
to what the apostle Paul says of the ancient Israelites, "The word preached did not profit them, not
being mixed withfaith in them that heard it."t
There is no part of Scripture which can be properly read without faith. And this faith must be
such as shall produce in us the very feelings intended by the divine Author in revealing the truth.
Thus, when we read a command, faith will lead us
to obey; when we read a threatening, to tremble;
when we read a promise, to embrace it. Especially, when any thing is written concerning the
blessed Saviour, faith will accept him, receive him,
and lean upon him for salvation.
Often ask yourself, therefore, while you are
reading, Do I really believe this from the heart?
And often lift up your heart with the prayer of the
apostles, " Lord, increase our faith!"
Direction VII.
READ WITH A WILLING AND OBEDIENT MIND.
Ernest. Have you not said something like this
already?
* 1 John v. 9.
t Heh. iv. 2.
214TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Uncle. I have, but I wish to call your attention
more particularly to the duty of reading with an
obedient disposition. The Bible teaches us chiefly
two things, first, what we are to believe, and, secondly, what we are to do. The former calls for
our faith, the latter for our obedience. Whatever
God commands we are bound to do; and when we
read any precept of the Scriptures, we should cherish the most cheerful and ready obedience. Without this, our reading will be of no use to us. This
is what the apostle James teaches us: "Be ye
doers of the word, and not hearers only."*  This
is what our Saviour also teaches in the parable of
the sower. The good ground represents those
hearers of the word who bring forth fruit, that is,
yield obedience to the will of God. Indeed, our
Lord seems to teach, that without this willing and
obedient temper, no man can have an assured faith
in the divine authority of what he learns: " If any
mail wvill (1o his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself."t You will read the Scriptures with the
greatest profit, when you are ready to say with
little Samuel, "' Speak, Lord, for thy servant hearethe."t

215AN INTRODUCTION
Ernest. Dear uncle, does every one read the
Bible in this way?
Uncle. Ah no! I am sorry to say that many
read very carelessly; and some who are very diligent in studying the word of God, learn it as a
mere task, just as they would learn any other les..
son; and seem never to think that it has any thing
to do with their own conduct. This leads me to
lay down another rule.
Direction VIII.
LET ALL THAT YOU READ BE APPLIED TO YOURSELF IN THE WAY OF SELF-EXAMINATION.
Ernest. I am afraid I do not know what is meant
by applying what I read to myself.
Uncle. I will explain. Whenever you take up
your Bible, you should say within yourself, Now
I am going to read the message of God, and I must
endeavour to gain some improvement from it. So
you will be ready to turn every thing to some account
for the profit of your soul. Thus when you read the
history of any good man, you should try to copy
his excellences. When you read of any wicked
act, you should endeavour to avoid the like. When
you read of any Christian virtue or grace, you
should inquire whether you possess it, and seek to
attain it. Take, for instance, the Lord's prayer.
When you read Forgive us our debts as we for2816TO THE SCRIPTURES.
give our debtors; you should endeavour to offer
up this prayer with a sincere heart, while you
read. And in order to do this, you should ask yourself, whether you do from the heart forgive all
those who have done you any evil; for unless you
do thus forgive, you cannot truly offer this petition.'rhis is what I mean by self-examination.
By reading in this way, the best men who have
ever lived have grown more and more holy.
Every time they read a portion of Scripture, they
are either convinced of some sin, and thus led to
repentance; or awakened to the performance of
some duty, and thus made more consistent Christians.
Direction IX.
SEEK TO HAVE YOUR AFFECTIONS STIRRED UP1
WHILE YOU READ.
Ililary. What do you mean by affections?
Uncle. I mean feelings, such as fear, joy, hope,
desire, love, confidence, and the like.
Ernest. What do you mean by having these
affections stirred up?
Uncle. I mean feeling in a lively manner, or
having these affections warm and awakened. For
instance, at some times when you are employed

of gay citizens.

Whom have you got to talk with?
Here uncle Austin looked very archly at the
little boy, and said, as he rose from his chair,
" Do you see that mahogany door? I have a
number of friends within, with whom I talk every
day."
Hilary. Ah, uncle! you think to catch me again
You mean your books. Now, do you not, uncle?
Uncle. I do, indeed. Is it not a strange thing
that I cannot entrap such a little fellow as you are?
I suppose I shall have to show you my library.
But we will first take a walk, and while we walk
I will tell you something about my place.
Hilary ran to get his uncle's cane, Ernest brought
his coat, and Miss Priscilla tied a handkerchief
around his neck. Then taking his hat, the good
old man gave an arm to each of the boys, and led
them out to survey the farm and grounds.
"' Yonder," said he, " is the place where youlr

about other things, you have scarcely any thoughts
about your dear parents. But when you retuin
home after an absence of some weeks, the sight of
your father and mother will fill you with affection
for them; per'haps your eyes will be filled with
tears; your love will then be awakened. In other
words, this affection will be stirred up. Does not
the thought, even now, give you pleasure?
Hilary. 0 yes, sir! I long to see them very
much.
Uncle. That is, you have a strong desire to see
them; now the affection of desire is stirred up in
your hearts. You also hope to see them before
long; and this hope is another affection or feeling
which is stirred up.
Most persons read the Scriptures without any
warmth, of feeling. They peruse God's message to
them as coldly and insensibly as if it were a common
book. This is what I wish you to avoid. When
you read of God's anger against sin, you should be
filled with godly fear. When you read of his
goodness and mercy, you should be filled with
gratitude. When you read of his glorious holiness, you should exercise love. And there is no
part of the Bible in which there may not be found
something to awaken some good feeling. Never
allow yourself to read this blessed volume in a cold,
unfeeling manner.
218TO THE SCRIPTURES.
There is no method so proper for awakening
devout feelings as the reading of the Holy Scriptures. For this reason, all pious persons have
made this a part of their private devotions; and
hence we are led to another important rule.
Direction X.
SET APART A SPECIAL TIME FOR DEVOTIONAL
READING.
Ernest. Do you mean that we ought to have a
certain hour of every day fixed for this purpose?
Uncle. Exactly. And by devotional reading
I mean that reading which is intended not so much
to communicate fresh knowledge as to warm our
hearts. The proper time for this will be when
you retire, for private prayer.
Hilary. Is it best to have particular hours for
secret prayer?
Uncle. I think it is. The holiest men have
found it so. Otherwise we are apt to neglect the
duty very often, or to omit it altogether. But if a certain hour be fixed, then whenever that hour comes,
we shall be put in mind of the duty; and it will
become habitual, so that we shall not be able to
omit it without pain.
Ernest. What parts of the Bible are most proper at such times?
Uncle. Those parts which demand little expla219AN INTRODUCTION
nation, being free from difficulty; and those parts
which touch our feelings most sensibly. Thus
the Psalms of David, and the history and discourses
of our Saviour in the gospels, will be found exceedingly profitable. I would advise you, when
you go to your private room or closet for prayer,
to begin by lifting up your heart to God for a moment or two, to ask his blessing. Then take the
Bible, and turn to some passage of the kind I have
mentioned. A very few verses will, in most cases,
be sufficient. Read these with the greatest atten.
tion and reverence. You need not perplex your.
self with difficulties, nor dwell even upon those
questions which might be very proper at another
time. But endeavour to have your heart affected
with the excellency of divine things. After this it
will be proper for you to engage in your solemn
prayers. And I hope, my dear children, that by
the grace of God, you will be enabled to say, that
these are the happiest hours of your whole life.
Let us now go on to the next in order.
Direction XI.
KEEP THE LORD JESUS IN VIEW IN ALL YOU READ.
Ernest. But is there not a great deal in the
Bible which does not relate to Christ?
Uncle. The Bible contains many passages which
do not teach any thing directly concerning Christ
220TO THE SCRIPTURES.
But, at the same time, Christ is the great subject
of the whole Scriptures. Both Testaments testify
of him. Thus he said to the Jews, " Search the
Scriptures," (or as some read it, " Ye do search
the Scriptures,") "' they are they which testify of
me."    The Old Testament prepared the way for
the Messiah, the New Testament reveals him.
The history of the Old Testament is chiefly a history of Christ's progenitors. The rites and ceremonies of the Jewish worship were filled with
types or emblemns of Christ. The prophecies predict his coming and his work; and the New Testament is entirely taken up with what relates to
him.
The great use of the Bible is to make us acquainted with the Redeemer. " This is life eternal; that they might know Thee, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent."t We
should therefore seek this knowledge in every part
of the Scriptures. "To him," says the apostle
Peter, " give all the prophets witness, that through
Ihis name whosoever believeth in him shall receive
remission of sins.'"
I will here read you a short extract from the
works of the excellent Leighton: " Let this also
commend the Scriptures much to our diligence and
* John v. 39.  t John xvii. 3   f Acts x. 43.

affection, that their great theme is our Redeemer,
and salvation wrought by him; that they contain
the display of his excellencies, and are the lively
picture of his matchless beauty. Were we more
engaged in reading them, we should daily see
more of him in them, and so of necessity love him
more."
The great question for every one of us is, What
must I do to be saved? The Bible answers this
question by showing us the Lord Jesus Christ. as
our divine Redeemer. Therefore keep him always
in view while you read.
Ernest. Every word you say, my dear uncle,
makes me feel condemned for having paid so little
attention to this best of books.
Uncle. The feeling is natural and reasonable;
and the last direction which I shall give you this
evening is this:
Direction XII.
READ THE BIBLE MORE THAN ANY THING ELSE.
Hilary. But how can we do this, when we have
so many hundred other books to read?
Uncle. This is the book of books-the best of
all-worth all the rest put together. If all other
books were destroyed, you might still be led to
eternal salvation by this alone.
Other books are to be read at proper times, and
222TO THE SCRIPTURES.
occasionally; but the Bible is to be read every day
There are many thousands of books in the world,
and we have so many within our reach, that we are
often tempted to neglect the Scriptures. But all
the learning of all the wise men that ever lived is
not to be compared with the wisdom of this book.
If the Bible were more constantly read, the earth
would be filled with better Christians.
Hilary. Is there no danger of becoming weary
of reading so much in one book?
Uncle. Those who read the Bible most, love it
best.  They find something new in it at every
fresh perusal. They prefer it to all other books,
and can say with David, "0 how I love thy law!
It is my meditation all the day."
Let me here relate an anecdote of the celebrated
Dr. Buchanan. Shortly before his death this good
man was talking to some of his friends about the
great pains he had taken to have the Syriac New
Testament correctly printed. He mentioned that
he read over every page five times, before it
went to the press. He said, he had expected
beforehand that this would have been tiresome,
but that every fresh perusal of the sacred page
seemed to unveil new beauties. Here he stop
ped, and burst into tears. " Do not be alarmed,"
said he, as soon as he had recovered himself, " I
could not suppress the emotion I felt as I recollected
223AN INTRODUCTION
the delight it pleased God to afford me in the read
ing of his word."
I have also read a pleasing account of a conver
sation between Count Oxenstiern, Chancellor of
Sweden, and Whitlock, an English ambassador.
The count, who was one of the greatest men of his
age, was at this time living in retirement. "I have
seen much," said he, " and enjoyed much of this
world, but I never knew how to live till now. I
thank my good God, who has given me time to
know him, and also myself. All the comfort I
have, and which is more than the whole world can
give, is the knowledge of God's love in my heart,
and the reading of this blessed book;" and here he
laid his hand on the Bible.
Ililary. I remember, uncle, that you told us in
the first conversation after we came, that the Bible
was the most interesting book in the world.
Uncle. Yes; and this has been the opinion of
the greatest men. Sir William Jones, who was
acquainted with many languages, and was one of
the most learned and accomplished scholars who
ever lived, wrote the following words in the blank
leaf of his Bible:
" I have regularly and attentively perused these
Holy Scriptures, and am of opinion, that this volume, independently of its divine origin, contains
more true sublimity, more exquisite beauty, more
224TO THE SCRIPTURES.             225
pure morality, more important history, and finer
strains of poetry and eloquence, than can be collected from all other books, in whatever age or
language they may have been written."  Let me,
therefore, exhort you, my dear nephews, to devote
yourselves to the study of the Scriptures. But the
eveniilg is passing away, and I will reserve what I
have still to say, until to-morrow and the day after,AN INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER XVII.
Rules for the reading of Scripture, continued:-The Bible must
be read daily-In regular course-Neglecting no part-In
suitable portions-Without prejudice-Comparing scriptuta
with scripture-With judicious use of commentaries, and abundant perusal of the text itself--The Bible our study for life.
As the time for their departure drew nigh, the
boys became more and more anxious to receive all
the instructions which their uncle had to communicate. At an early hour, the next evening, they
reminded him that he had promised to continue his
directions for reading the Scriptures; and their
good uncle, with a benignant countenance, began
as follows.
Uncle. I have already given you twelve directions; I shall now proceed to give you about as
many more.
Direction XIII.
READ THE BIBLE DAILY.
There was a celebrated Greek painter, who accomplished such a number of works as surprised
his friends, until he told theIn that his motto was,

effect a great deal in the course of a year. It is
226TO THE SCRIPTURES.
constant dropping which wears away the rocks.
Hence it is far more important to read a portion
every day, even though it be only a few verses,
than to read many chapters at once, but at irregular
intervals. The Holy Scriptures are the nourishment of our souls, just as food is of our bodies;
and we should be as unwilling to omit our daily
portion of the word of God, as to miss one of our
ordinary meals.
Ernest. Some people read the Bible only on
Sundays.
Uncle. The Lord's-day is a very suitable time
for reading the Scriptures; indeed, this should be
one our chief employments on that day. But we
need the light of God's truth every day that we
live. The psalmist calls the Scriptures the man
of his counsel; that is, his adviser. We should
seek the advice anld counsel of God day by day.
It is a good thing to keep our minds constantly
uiiler the influence of divine truth. This has been
the practice of good men, even of those who hav'e
had many laborious occupations to distract their
attention. I suppose you have both read Miss
HIannah More's beautiful tract, called " The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain."
Hilary. Yes, sir; we have read it a number of
times; and we have also read in other books about
this shepherd.

gardener. There is a hedge which I have amused
myself in making. There is a row of pear trees
which I planted when I was a boy. There is
a broken tree which I saw struck with lightning many years ago. And on the other side of
the bridge is a little row of houses, which I have
built for some of my poor neighbours. In the opposite direction, you may see the steeple of the
church rising among the trees. Thus you see,
my dear children, that whenever I come out of my
doors, I see something or other to remind me of
past days."
The boys now began to roam over the farm, and
the old gentleman, finding it cold, returned to the
house. Here he had a fire made in his library,
and prepared several things for the amusement of
his nephews, whom he loved very much.AN INTRODUCTION
Ernest. It is all a true story, and his real name
was David Saunders.
Uncle. Very well. Now what I was about to
tell you is this. David Saunders once said to Dr.
Stonehouse:--" Blssed be God! through his
mercy I learned to read when I was a boy. I
believe there is no day, for the last thirty years,
that I have not peeped at my Bible. If we can't
find time to read a chapter, I defy any man to say
he can't find time to read a verse; and a single
verse, well followed and put in practice every day,
would make no bad figure at the year's end; three
hllundred and sixty-five texts, without the loss of a
moment's time, would make a pretty stock, a little
golden treasury, as one may say, from new-year's
day to new-year's day; and if children were
brought up to it, they would come to look for their
text as naturally as they do for their breakfast. I
can say the greatest part of my Bible by heart. I
have led but a lonely life, and have often had but
little to eat; but my Bible has been meat, drink,
and company to me; and when want and trouble
have come upon me, I don't know what I should
have done indeed, if I had not had the promises of
this book for my stay and support."
Ernest. rhat is a beautiful anecdote; it is one
of the things which I will try to remember.
Uncle. I have said enough on this head.
228TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Direction XIV.
READ IN REGULAR COURSE.
Ernest. Do you mean that we should begin at
Genesis and read through to Revelation?
Uncle. I do; and when you have gone through
once, begin again, and re-peruse the whole, and so
continue during the remainder of your life.
Hilary. But should we never read in any other
place?
Uncle. I do not mean that. I have already ad7ised you to make selections for your devotional'reading. Likewise, at other times, you may turn
over the pages of your Bible, and pick out such
places as suit your present state of mind. But
still, there should be some hour of the day in
wlhich you should be regularly and systematically
going through the whole revelation of God.
Ernest. But according to this, we might be for
many months reading the Old Testament, without
looking at the New; or reading the New Testament
writhout looking at the Old.
Uncle. I have thought of this; and to prevent
this evil, I recommend to you a method which I
have pursued myself; which is, to read daily in
1oth Testaments; a portion of one in the morning,
and a portion of the other in the evening. Or,
20
229AN INTRODUCTION
what is the same thing, read each Testament separately, over and over, in course.
Hilary. What -advantage is there in this regular
method?
Uncle. It has many advantages. In this way
you always complete one book before you begin
another. Thus you are able to observe the connexion of the parts. You also get every part of
the instruction just in its proper place. And you
are moreover secured against the evil of omitting
any portion. But this is so important, that you
may write it down by itself.
Direction XV.
NEGLECT NO PART OF SCRIPTURE.
Those who read the Bible at random can scarcely
avoid this. Even after several years' study, there
will be passages to which they have paid no special
attention.
Ernest. But are not some parts of Scripture
more important than others?
Uncle. Certainly.  But unless we read every
part, we shall not be likely to find, out which these
important parts are. Having once discovered this,
we may read them over and over, at other times,
as often as we choose. But "all Scripture is
given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for

doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness."'
We do not always know while we are reading,
what portions will prove most useful to us. I have
often found myself warned, instructed, and comforted, by the recollection of texts which appeared
to me very unimportant while I was perusing them.
Therefore we ought to neglect nt portion of Scripture.
Hilary. I have always read most in the New
Testament.
Uncle. This is usually the case. Many persons
go through life altogether ignorant of the delightful
histories and glorious prophecies of the Old Testament. You will be careful to avoid this error, and
the observance of the preceding rule will be of the
greatest advantage to you.
Direction XVI.
LET YOUR DAILY PORTION BE OF PROPER
LENGTH; NEITHER TOO MTJCH NOR TOO LITTLE
Ernest. How much is a proper quantity?
Uncle. That is a question which every one must
answer for himself. Some men have more leisure
than others; some grow weary of their book mnuch1
sooner than others. The learned Dr. Gouge used
* 2 Tim. iii. 16.
231AN INTRODUCTION
to read fifteen chapters daily; and I suppose the
good shepherd of Salisbury plain, on his busy
days, read only as many verses.
Ernest. But is it not best to have a fixed portion for every day?
Uncle. I think it is. On the Lord's-day one
can, of course, read more than on other days,
There are many good methods of dividing the
Scriptures so as to read them through once every
year.  I have found the following division very
convenient.
Five chapters every Sunday, and three chapters on each of the other days, will take yov
through the Bible in a year.
The next rule which I have to give you will be
of more value to you when you are older; but you
may write it down, and learn the meaning of it. I!

READ FOR YOURSELF; IMPARTIALLY, AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
That is, do not cling to your preconceived
opinions, when the Bible is against them.
Ernest. What are preconceived opinions?
Uncle. When any one makes up his mind upoii
any point, before he examines what the Bible
teaches, this opinion of his is a preconceived
232TO THE SCRIPTURES.
opinion; and very often it is altogether wrong.
For example, I have a neighbour who is a Universalist; that is, he does not believe in any future
punishment. He formed this opinion without looking at the Scripture, and now he is so full of prejudice that he cannot read with impartiality. He
is unable to see that the whole Bible is against
him. The right way is to get all our doctrines
from the Scriptures. We never can be secure in
believing any thing unless we find it there revealed.
Ernest. Ought we not to believe every thing
which is preached by ministers of the gospel?
Uncle. Not at all; we are to believe them just
so far as they agree with the word of God. At the
same time, we should always listen to their words
with an humble, teachable mind. It is very dangerous to indulge a spirit of criticism, contradiction,
and perpetual doubt. Yet you remember what is
said of those Bereans who heard the preaching of
Saul and Silas: "These were more noble than
those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word
with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so."*
Hilary. I have heard that the Catholics are not
allowed to do this.
Uncle. They are not. This is one grand differ

ence between Protestants and Papists. The Protestant claims the right of judging for himself; the
Papist is bound to believe just what the church says.
Direction XVIII.
IN EVERY PASSAGE, TRY TO HAVE BEFORE YOUR
MIND THE WHOLE SCENE, AND ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
Ernest. Please to make this rule plainer.
Uncle. In plainer language: whenever you read
any account in the Scriptures, try to feel as if you
were there. Bring up before your mind all the
circumstances. Consider who is the writer or
speaker; observe to whom the words were addressed. If it is an historical transaction, learn all
you can about the time, the place, the surrounding
objects, and the persons present. In order to do
this, you will find it useful to be familiar with biblical geography, manners, and customs.
Hilary. Perhaps, sir, you can make this more
clear by an example.
UTncle. I will endeavour to do so. In the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of Exodus, we have
a sublime description of the giving of the law.
But a mere hasty perusal of these chapters will not
make a sufficient impression on your minds. You
must try to bring it up before your view, as if you
had actually beheld it. Consider the time: it was
234TO THE SCRIPTURES.
nearly fifteen hundred years before Christ. Consider the place: it was Mount Sinai in Arabia.
And here you must try to find out every thing about
this mountain and desert, by means of maps, plates,
and descriptions. Consider the persons: here
were more than a million of Israelites, encamped
around this mountain. Then try to get a distinct
idea of the scene. The vast multitudes are trembling with awful expectation. The mountain is
wrapt in clouds and fire; there are thunders and
lightnings, and the sound of a dreadful mysterious
trumpet.'The smoke of Sinai ascends, as if it
were a mighty furnace. Moses and Aaron approach, and hear the voice of Jehovah. Now, if
you can have all these circumstances before your
mind, the effect will be great and lasting.
So also, in every other part of the Bible, you
must, as far as possible, place yourself in the very
midst of the scene which is represented.
Hilary. This rule is very new to me; but I perceive that it will assist us very much in understanding what we read.
Direction XIX.
COMPARE PASSAGE WITH PASSAGE.
Ernest. I think, sir, you have once before advised us to do this, when you were speaking of the
marginal references.
Uncle. I did so. And therefore I need only
235:AN INTRODUCTION
now remind you of what I then said, particularly
of the remarks of Bishop Horsley, which I read to
you.* Let me, however, add to these the observations of the pious Dr. Scott. This learned man
made a very laborious collection of marginal refer.
ences, amounting in number to many thousands.
He was therefore well qualified to judge what
would be the effects of this method of studying
Scripture.  Now hear what he says: "Though I
had for many years previously studied the Scriptures as my one grand business, I can truly aver
that the insight which I have thus obtained into
many parts, which before I had not so carefully
noted, is so great, as abundantly to repay my labour, and to convince me, that, along with other
means, consulting well-selected marginal references
forms one of the best helps for fixing the word of
God in the memory, leading the mind to a just interpretation of it, and in many cases rendering it
most affecting to the heart.--To those who desire
to study the Scriptures accurately and deeply, I
would very earnestly recommend to set apart an
hour, or half an hour, every day, when it can be
done; and regularly to go through the Scriptures,
carefully consulting all the references."t

Direction XX.
PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE CONNEXION
AND SCOPE OF EVERY PASSAGE.
By the connexion, I mean what goes before and
after the passage. By the scope, I mean the intention of the writer, or what he is aiming to prove or
teach. In other words, always bear in mind what
the sacred penman is writing about.
Many readers altogether neglect the connexion
of passages. They read perhaps a single chapter
at a time, without looking back to see what the
preceding chapter was about, or looking forward to
see what comes next. Now it is impossible to get
the full meaning of any book, by reading it in this
way. The direction I have just given is particularly important in several of the epistles; where
there is a great deal of reasoning or argument.
Again, we must always consider the scope of a
passage; that is, what it is intended to teach; or
we shall fall into very great mistakes. Thus many
of our Lord's beautiful parables have been misunderstood and grossly perverted.
Direction XXI.
MAKE A JUDICIOUS USE OF COMMENTARIES.
Ernest. I have heard Mr. Derby say that he
never needs any commentary.

WHEN it began to grow dark, Ernest and Hilary
returned to the house, and were immediately con.
ducted to their uncle's study. Hilary had now an
opportunity to see for himself what his brothe"
had told him.  The study, as it was always called,
was a large room in the pleasantest part of the
house. A row of windows on the eastern side
made it very light and cheerful, and the opposite
wall was entirely covered with handsome shelves,
full of books. Between the windows were several
paintings and maps, and over the chimney-piece
was a plan of the city of Jerusalem. Hilary had
never seen such a place before. He was used to
his father's store and counting-room, and you could
hardly have shown him any thing new in the way
of merchandise; but he was not so much acquainted
with books. After he had gazed about him for a
time, his uncle said to him, "Come here, nephew,
and sit near the lamp, for I have something to show

commentary almost every day.
Hilary. But some of the commentaries are so
very large, and in so many great volumes, that I
should think it would take half a lifetime to read
them through.
Uncle. I would by no means advise you to read
a large commentary through. For this reason, I
have recommended a judicious use of these helps.
By reading too much of a commentary, we shall be
led to read too little of the text. The use of a
commentary is to explain to us that which it
is difficult to understand.  Where a passage is
perfectly plain, or has been already explained to
us, it is often a loss of time to read any explanation
of it. But there are many real difficulties in the
Bible, and here we need the help of those wise and
good men who have spent their lives in the study
of the Scriptures.
Ililary. What commentary would you recommend to us?
Uncle. There are so many that are excellent,
that I shall not undertake to choose for you. On
this point, you had better take the advice of your
minister. Always bear in mind, however, that the
text, rather than any explanation of it, should be
your great study. For this reason, I add:
238TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Direction XXII.
READ THE TEXT ABUNDANTLY.
By the text, I here mean the very words of
the Scripture. This should be our great study.
Some persons read some five or six verses of the
text, and then spend an hour or more in reading
notes upon it. Just the reverse of this seems to
me to be the proper method. I have always observed that those who read most largely in the text
of Scripture, are most acquainted with its meaning.
By continually reading over and over the same
passages, and comparing one place with another,
they have their greatest difficulties cleared up.
One verse throws light upon another; and what is
taught obscurely in one place, is expressed plainly
and fully in another. Indeed, no man can well
fail to be learned'in the Scriptures, who goes on
from day to day, reading large portions, in regular
order, and with devout attention.
Hilary. Might there not be danger of one's runrang on too fast?
Uncle. Certainly. You should have your set
times, for not only reading, but stud(ying the Scriptures. At these times, let no difficulty pass witilout an attempt to have it explained. But you
should often, at other times, take up the Bible, for
the express purpose of rapid and cursory reading;
239AN INTRODUCTION
just as you would peruse any other very interesting volume. At such times, you may read a number of chapters at one sitting. I have found the
greatest profit and pleasure in thus going over a
whole book or epistle in the course of one day.
This brings the whole subject before the mind at
one view; and if you will persevere in sometimes
reading the same book over and over a number of
times before you leave it, you will find it delightful
and more clear at each repetition.
Ernest. Dear uncle, you talk as if we had a
great deal of time upon our hands; and as if we
had nothing else to do but to read the Bible.
Uncle. I will reply to you by another rule:
Direction XXIII.
REMEMBER THAT THIS BOOK IS TO BE THE
STUDY OF YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
This must be your one book, more loved
and more studied than all others.  If I were
to take down one of my great folio volumes, and
say,'Boys, you must take this book, and read it
over twenty times;' you might very properly
answer:'Life is too short, for we have many
other books to read.' But when I say this of the
Bible, there is no propriety in such a reply. For
the Bible is given to us to be our instructer and
counsellor as long as we live. Be patient and per240TO THE SCRIPTURES.
se-iering, and consider that this is a study which
you are never to leave off, as long as you live.
Although I have advised you to a course of scriptural study, which may seem to require a great deal
of time, you are not to suppose that the work is to
be accomplished in a year, or even ten years, and
then laid aside, as you lay aside your other studies.
No; you will never see the day, in this world, in
which you can say that you have now done with
the Bible.
Hilary. And did those good men, whom you
have spoken about, study the Bible in this way, as
long as they lived?
Uncle. Yes; and some of them even on their
death-beds. Let me read you an account of the
Venerable Bede, which is contained in this little
volume.*
Ernest. Who was the person of whom you are
about to read?
Uncle. His name was Beda, or Bede, and he
was an eminent servant of Christ, who lived in
England more than a thousand years ago. He was
called Venerable Bede, from the great dignity and
holiness of his character. He translated the Bible
into the Anglo-Saxon tongue, which was then the
language of our forefathers.

241AN INTRODUCTION
One of his pupils gives the following narrative
of his last hours: " Many nights he passed without
sleep, yet rejoicing and giving thanks, unless when
a little slumber intervened. When he awoke, he
resumed his accustomed devotions, and, with expanded hands, never ceased returning thanks to
God. In such solemn joy, we passed fifty days,
but during these days, besides the daily lectures
which he gave, he endeavoured to compose two
works, one of which was a translation of St. John's
gospel into English. It had been observed of him,
that he never knew what it was to do nothing; and
after his breathing became still shorter, he dictated
cheerfully, and sometimes said,' Make haste, I
know not how long I shall hold out; my Malker
may take me away very soon.' On one occasion,
a pupil said to him,' Most dear master, there is
yet one chapter wanting; do you think it trouiblesome to be asked any more questions?' He answered,' It is no trouble; take your pen, and write
fast.' He continued to converse cheerfully, and
while his friends wept as he told them they would
see him no more, they rejoiced to hear him say,' It is now time for me to return to Him who made
me. The time of my dissolution draws near. I
desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ. Yes,
my soul desires to see Christ, my king, in his
beauty.' The pupil, before mentioned, said to

hiim,' Dear master, one sentence is still wanting.'
He replied,' Write quickly!' The young man
soon added,' It is finished!' He answered,'Thou
hast well said-all is finished! Hold my heaa in
thy hands; I shall delight to sit at the opposite
side of the room, on the holy spot at which I have
been accustomed to pray, and where, whilst sitting,
I can call upon my Father.' Being placed on the
floor of his little room, he sang,' Glory be to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;'
and expired as he uttered the last words." So
that this excellent man may be said to have died
while engaged in the study of the Holy Scriptures.
I shall now leave you for the evening; and tomorrow we will close our conversations with a few
additional rules.AN INTRODUCTION

THE last day of the visit to Oakdale had now
come, and when Ernest and Hilary entered the old
gentleman's study in the evening there was a sadness in their countenances. Their aged friend had
been very kind to them, and had taught them many
useful things; so that they were grieved at the
thought of leaving him. He perceived this, and
began his conversation with them in the following
words.
Uncle. My dear nephews, you are to leave my
house to-morrow, and perhaps we may never meet
again in this world. You see I am an old man,
and it would not be very strange if I should be
called out of this world before you ever revisit this
part of the country. I therefore try to give you
the: best instructions which I can think of; and I
hope they may be of use to you when I am dead
and gone.

Ernest. It makes us sorry, dear uncle, to hear
you talk so. But I am sure both Hilary and I
will endeavour to remember all your kind instructions.
Uncle. Let me then proceed with the rules.
Direction XXIV.
CHERISH ARDENT LOVE FOR THE SCRIPTURES.
I am persuaded that if I should write you any
book of advice, you would feel great regard for it,
out of love for me. But the Scriptures are given
you by your heavenly Father; how much more
should you honour and love them! Do you renmember what David says about this?
Ernest. " O how I love thy law! It is my meditation all the day."*
Hilary. He also says, "I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold."t
Uncle. Very well repeated. He further says,
"How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea,
sweeter than honey to my mouth."; This is the
feeling of every pious soul: and the fuirther we go
in the knowledge of the Scriptures, the more shall
we love them. Never allow yourselves to fall into
the habit of reading them as a task, but open the

warmth of affection, and rebuke your own hearts
when you find yourselves destitute of it.
I have read of a certain Mr. Harris, a tradesmlan
of London, whose love for the Scripture was suclh,
that when his eyesight became dim, he caused the
book of Psalms, and almost all the New Testament,
to be written with white ink on black paper, in letters an inch long; that he might still read the best
of books in his old age.
ifilatry. I have heard of persons who copied the
Bible with their own hands.
Uncle. Yes, the emperor Theodosius is said to
have done so with the New Testament. The reformer, Zuinglius, transcribed the Epistles of Paul,
and committed them to memory. In the early period of the Reformation, when Bibles were very
scarce, and when it was dangerous to possess them,
there were many instances of this strong attachment. The poor persecuted Christians used to
meet, for the reading of the Scriptures, in garrets
and lofts, or on board vessels. In the reign of the
popish king James II., when many good people
feared the re-establishment of the Romish power,
there was a pious man who copied out the whole
Bible in short hand, for his own use, lest the Scriptures should be suppressed.

CHARGE YOUR MEMORY WITH ALL THAT YOU
READ.
I suppose you need scarcely be told the reason
for this direction.
Hilary. If we do not remember what we read,
we might as well not read at all; it can do us no
good.
Uncle. Very true; and in order to remember,
we must charge our memory, as if we told memory to keep it safe. Do you always read in this
way?
Ernest.  Sometimes, I confess, what I read
seems to slip out of my mind.
Uncle. This is, indeed, too commonly the case.
WVith some people, all that they read slips out of
their mind. When they have perused a certain
portion, they shut the book, and never think of it
again for that day. Ask them in the evening what
they were reading about in the morning, and they
cannot tell. This is sufficiently plain without any
further explanation.
Ernest. I suppose you do not mean that we
should try to get every verse' by heart,' so as to
be able to repeat it without book.
Uncle. Certainly not; but here is another rule,
relating to this very point.

hand?"
Hilary. It looks like a pocket handkerchief, sir.
Ernest. It looks more like a map.
Hilary. But who ever saw a map on a piece of
red cotton cloth?
Ernest. Who ever saw a handkerchief with
mountains, and lakes, and rivers on it?  Yes, and
here I see the latitude and longitude.
Uncle. You are both right. It is a handkerchief
with a map painted on it. The map represents the
Holy Land. The names are in Hebrew. It is so
printed (or rather lithographed) for the convenience
of Jews travelling to Palestine. The map is a very
correct one; I obtained it from Trieste, where it
was made.:
Ernest. Would not that map help one to understand the Bible?
Uncle. It would help one who could read
Hebrew: but we have better maps of Palestine. There, over the sofa, hangs an excellent
map published by the American Suhnday-school
Union.
Hilary. Why do you think so much of the Bible, uncle? Almost all your books and pictures
have something to do with tle Bible.
Uncle. A very proper question. I have founa

COMMIT TO MEMORY SOME PORTION OF SCRIP
TURE EVERY DAY.
There is great advantage in this practice. If
you have much of the Bible in your memory, you
will be able to think of these precious words when
you cannot have your book before you. This will
be very profitable, for it may serve to direct and
comfort you when you are travelling, or sick, or
during the hours of night. It will also help you to
understand those passages which you read.
Hilary. How much ought we to get each day?
Uncle. You may begin with a single verse.
After a few weeks, you will find it so much easier,
that you will find no more difficulty in learning ten
or twelve verses, than you had at first in learning
one. The memory is greatly strengthened by
daily practice; and this is another advantage which
your minds will receive from what I am recommending. By degrees you will have many chapters, and even whole books of Scripture treasured
up in your memory.
Ernest. Are there any persons who know whole
books by memory?
Uncle. There have been many such, as I shall
show you by several examples.  The Reverend
Doctor Marryat began this practice in his early
248TO THIIE SCRIPTURES.
youth, and pursued it so far, that he is said to have
committed to memory the books of Job, Psalms,
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, all the lesser Prophets, and all the Epistles.
Hilary. I should think he would forget what he
had learned.
Uncle. In order to prevent this, he used to repeat the whole, by memory, once every year.
Here is another instance. Theodore Beza, a celebrated reformer, lived to such an age that he could
not recollect things which lie had heard a few
mninutes before. Yet at this very time, it is said
that he was able to repeat the Epistles of Paul,
which he had committed to memory when he was
young.
Ernest. This really astonishes me; I did not
know that such a thing was possible.
Uncle. Let it encourage you to make the attempt.
Viscount Carteret, who was lord-lieutenant of Ireland, in 1724, could repeat from memory the whole
of the New T'estament. The same thing is said
of Pierpont Edwards, son of President Edwards.
But this is not all. The late Rev. Thomas Threlkeld, of Lancashire, in England, used to be called
a living concordance. If any three words were
mentioned, (unless they were such as occur in
many passages,) he could immediately, without
hesitation, assign the chapter and verse where they
249AN INTRODUCTION
might be found; or, if the chapter and verse were
mentioned, he could repeat the words. I have
heard the same thing related of the Rev. John
Brown, of Haddington..Ernest. Were these men of great genius and
learning?
Uncle. Most of them were so. But the same
thing has been true of many unlearned and humble
persons. One of the most remarkable instances of
this was an old man of Stirling, in Scotland, who
went by the name of Blind Alick. He had been
blind from his childhood. He was sent to a common school to keep him out of mischief, and here
he began to commit to memory what lie heard the
other scholars read. In other ways and places,
he continued to seek the knowledge of the Scriptures; and such was the success of this blind beggar, that he came at last to know the whole of the
Bible, both Old and New Testaments, by heart.
His case excited the interest of many persons,
and among others, of the late celebrated Professor
Dugald Stewart. Alick was often examined, and
the result was always satisfactory. You might
repeat any passage of the Scripture, and he would
tell you chapter and verse; or you might tell him
the chapter and verse, and he would repeat to you
the passage, word for word. A gentleman, to
puzzle him, read a verse of the Bible, with a slight
250TO THE SCRIPTURES.
alteration. Alick hesitated a moment, and then
told him where it was to be found, but said it had
not been correctly given; he then repeated it as it
stood in the book.'Mie gentleman then asked him
for the ninetieth verse of the seventh chapter of
Numbers. Alick was again puzzled for a moment,
but quickly replied, "You are fooling me, sirs!
there is no such verse-that chapter has only
eighty-nine verses."
E1rnest. How long ago did this happen?
Uncle. Blind Alick was still living in 1833, and
I have never heard of his death. In relating to
you these incidents, I do not suppose that either
you or I could ever make such wonderful acquisitions. But at the same time, we should be encouraged to improve the talent which we actually possess. All of us might commit more of the Scriptures
to memory than we do. And, as I have already
said, even those parts which we do not commit to
memory should be read with such care, that we
may be able afterwards to recall them to our
minds.
Direction XXVII.
EXAMINE YOURSELF ON WHAT YOU HAVE READ.
When you have read any chapter or chapters,
and are about to close the book, it would be well
to pause and ask yourself such questions as these:
251252~          AN INTRODUCTION
What have I nrow been reading about? What persons have been mentioned? What doctrines have
I learned from this passage? What precepts are
here given, or what duty enforced? What example
is here set before me?  What is there in these
verses which it may be important for me to recollect during the day?
Such questions will enable you to discover whether you have been attentive and faithful. If you
find that you have passed over any thing negligently, you may return to the book, and make up
the deficiency. In every case, this self-examination will fix in your memory what you have been
reading. When you again take up the Bible, at
your next stated hour for scriptural study, it will
be proper to ask yourself similar questions about
the passage last read. Thus you will always be
sure to keep up the connexion of the parts.
Ernest. Might not two friends examine one
another in this way?
Uncle. Yes; and where two read together, the
exercise would be truly profitable. But even when
pursued in the solitary manner which I have represented, it leads to great good. I find it a good
method, when I have finished any book of Scripture, to recall to mind, as far as possible, all its
contents. Also at night, I have often been profited by going over in my mind, as I have lain inTO THE SCRIPTURES.
bed, the Scripture passages which I had read during the day. This brings me to another important
point.
Direction XXVIII.
MAKE WHAT YOU READ THE SUBJECT OF MEDITATION.
Here that sweet text of David may again be
applied: "0 O how I love thy law! It is my meditation all the day."" No doubt this holy man
turned the words of revelation in his thoughts, by
day and by night. So should we do likewise.
Thus God said to the Israelites: " These words,
which I command thee this day, shall be in thy
heart."t There is no better proof of our loving
the word of God, than our having it constantly in
our thoughts; and there is no happier method of
keeping every thing evil out of our minds.
Dr. Doddridge, and other excellent writers, have
recommended it as a useful practice, to select some
text every morning, to be our special subject of
meditation during the day. If we cannot do more,
we can repeat to ourselves these sacred words, and
thus exclude the vain imaginations which often vex
us. This plan has been adopted by many of the
best men I have ever known. It is but a few days

since I was reading the life of a very pious German
bookseller, -named Henry Julius Elers, who was
an intimate friend and helper of the celebrated
Francke.*  The following statement is made concerning him. "Elers' preparation for every day
consisted of a serious meditation on some important
Scripture text, which he chose after his morning
prayer. He received great benefit from this practice,
and earnestly recommended it to others. He used
to say,' Such a text, deeply impressed on the heart,
employs me all the day. I use it as a staff for my
support. It secures me from distraction of mind
during my business; and if I am called upon to instruct any one, I am never at a loss for a text.' He
used to write down these daily texts in his memorandum book, and the last which he ever inserted
in it was,' Let your loins be girt about, and your
lamps burning,' &amp;c."t
Hilary. I think this is an excellent way. We
might write down a text every day in a nice little
book, and this would be worth preserving. And
then we might commit these same texts to memory.
Uncle. Excellent, indeed! I hope you will both

put it in practice; as well as the other hints I have
been giving you in our repeated conversations.
Ernest. Dear uncle, we have never heard so
much conversation on these subjects before. What
can be the reason that we scarcely ever hear people
talking about the Bible?
Uncle. It must arise from a want of interest in
this blessed book, for " out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaketh." But I have a special
rule for this:
Direction XXIX.
FREQUENTLY CONVERSE ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE
3EEN READING.
Ernest. We often do so about other books
which we read; I frequently hear ladies and gentlemen talk an hour at a time about the last novel.
Uncle. That is because they love what they
read. We should speak of the delightful truths of
God's word. It will be natural to do so, if we
have them much in our minds. But too often we
read the Scriptures in a formal way, like a task,
and seem glad to forget them when the book is
closed. Observe that there is a special command
in Scripture to do this very thing. " I'hese words,
which I command thee this day, shall be in thy
heart. And thou shall teach them diligently unto
thy children, and shall talk of them when thou sit255AN INTRODUCTION
test in thy house, and when thou walkest by the
way, and when thou liest down, and when thou
risest up."*
Hilary. But I should scarcely know how to
begin to talli about the Bible.
Uncle. Just as you would about any other serious book in which you are interested. Not that
you are to make set speeches, or speak beyond
your knowledge. This would be vain and affected.
But you may ask one another questions, or converse about Scripture characters; and as your
knowledge increases, you will find a multitude of
points relating to Scripture, upon which you may
talk with your friends, to your great profit.
Direction XXX.
TURN WHAT YOU READ INTO PRAYER.
By observing this rule, you will find the Scriptures a perpetual help to your devotions. You will
thus be taught, both how to pray, and what to pray
for as you ought.
Ernest. Some passages in the Bible seem to me
to be prayers already.
Uncle. That is very true; and in all such cases,
the words may be profitably used, without alteration; provided that you repeat them with the spirit
Deut. vi. 6, 7.
256TO THE SCRIPTURES.
of prayer. Thus most passages in the Psalms of
David are prayer; in which I include, not merely
petition, but adoration, thanlksgiving, and confession
Thus, when David says, "Teach me to do thy
will, for thoti art my God!"` the words are a petition, and you should try to feel as David did, and
earnestly offer the same prayer. Again, when he
says, " I acknowledge my transgressions, and my
sin is ever before me;"t you should endeavour to
make this confession with real repentance of heart..Ernest. But how can this be done in those other
parts of Scripture which are not in the form of
prayer?
Uncle. It-is to such passages that the direction
more particularly applies.  These you must turn
into prayer. For instance, if you read of a truly
pious man, you may lift up your heart silently to
God, in supplication for grace to enable you to follow the example. When you read a commandment, you may pray thus: "Lord, have mercy
upon me, and incline my heart to keep this law."
When you read a promise, you may pray that it
may be fulfilled in yourself; thus, when God says,
" My grace is sufficient for tllee,": you should
pray, "O Lord, let thy grace ever be sufficient for
mne!"  This rule agrees with one given by the
* Ps. cxliii. 10.  t Ps. li. 3.  $ 2 Cor. xii. 9.

out that I have more entertainment from this book
than from any thing else.
Ernest. Entertainment! Why, uncle, I never
thought of getting entertainment from the Bible. I
thought it was the most serious book in the world.
Uncle. So it is, but also entertaining. There is
such a thing as serious entertainment. It is the best
sort. One does not become weary of it so soon. I
love to read about the people of ancient times-their
greatness, their adventures, and their wonderful
deeds. I have other reasons for liking this holy
book, which I mean to give you at another time.
But, as you are boys, and not old men, I mentioned
the entertainment it affords.
Ernest. But, uncle Austin, I do not understand
you. When I want to be entertained, I like to
read in histories about battles, and generals, and
such things.  I like to read about the adventures of Captain Cook, and Baron Trenck; or
about Alexander the Great, and Hannibal, and
Peter of Russia. And I read in the Bible to learn
what is good.
Uncle. True, the Bible teaches us concerning
God, and our duty; but God has been so condescending as to make it at the same time the most
interesting book in the world. If you like to read
of adventures, this book is full of them; and what
is more, they are all true. There is not a word
24AN INTRODUCTION
Rev. Thomas Hartwell Horne, in his celebrated
Introduction to the Study of Scripture: he says,
"The words of the passage selected for our private
reading, after its import has been ascertained, may
beneficially be summed up, or comprised in very
brief prayers or ejaculations."
Hilary. What is the meaning of ejaculations?
Uncle. It is derived from a Latin word which
means to throw a dart. Ejaculations are short
prayers, offered during other employments, and, as
it were, dartedforth towards heaven. This direction applies most to your private reading for devotional purposes.
And now I have come to the very last of my
rules. And I beg you, my beloved nephews, to
bear in your minds what I am now about to say to
you.
Direction XXXI.
IN ALL YOUR READING, REMEMBER THAT IT IS
FOR THE SALVATION OF YOUR SOUL.
This, my dear boys, is the reason why I have been
so earnest in exhorting you to the study of the Bible.
All your other studies and attainments extend their
influence only to this life; here is a book which
makes wise unto salvation. Many of the most
learned men in the world have had no spiritual
knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ; and therefoie
258TO THE SCRIPTURES.
their souls have perished. Dreadful thought! For
of what advantage can all human learning be to any
mar, if at last he goes away into everlasting fire!
Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, Wf7hat
shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul?* I am, therefore,
unspeakably anxious about you, lest you should
neglect this great salvation.
Young persons are too apt to forget the importance of these things. You feel strong and cheerful
now, and expect a long life of many pleasures.
But consider, that in a single day, yes, a single
moment, you may be brought to death.   The
greater part of the human race never reach the age
of manhood. And even if your lives should be
spared, how many things may happen to lead you
astray, and ruin your immortal soul. I perceive
that these things now affect you; I am glad that
they do so. But if you allow these youthful impressions to wear away, you will probably become
more hardened and impenitent, the older you grow.
Hear the word of God, saying to you, " Remember'sow thy Creator, in the days of thy youth."t
Many persons are now in perdition, who were instructed in religion, and who felt just as you now

259
t Eccl. xii. 1.AN INTRODUCTION
do, when they were young; but they resisted the
Holy Spirit, and died in their sins. I pray that
this may never be the case with you.
Whenever you open the Scriptures, let this
thought be in your minds; and pray thlat God
would bless all that you read, to the salvation of
your souls. Do not think, however, that the mere
knowledge of what is in the Bible will secure this
blessing. Mliany have been diligent students of the
Scriptures, who have never felt its saving effects.
A man may know the whole Bible by memory, and
yet be destitute of true religion. Hence it is of the
utmost importance that you should read with the
right spirit, and especially that you should have the
blessing of God upon what you read.
We are now about to separate. Before many
days, I must depart from this world; but I hope,
when we all stand before our Judge, we shall meet
with joy, and hear from his lips those gracious
words: " Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world."*
That this may be our blessed lot, let us now
pray to God.
Here the boys, who were affected even to tears

and affectionate prayer for them.
After this he requested them to read over the
directions he had given them; whicllh were as follows:

from beginning to end which is not true. Ernestlikes to read of great captains and wars. I am
afraid he has something of the soldier in him.
Now the Bible has the most remarkable accounts
of this kind. There never was a greater commander than Moses.
Ernest. Moses! Uncle, are you in earnest?
Uncle. To be sure I am in earnest. Moses was, great general. Just think of what he did. He
led out more than a million of people through a sea,
and through a desert, and through the land of enemies, to the border of Canaan. And he was forty
years their leader. What other general ever did
this? And he wrote the account of it himself, and
here we have it all in the Bible.
Ernest. Cwesar also wrote about his own wars.
Uncle. Yes; I am glad you take notice of this.
Listen again. Joshua was a great captain. Jephthah
was a remarkable commander. Samson was a
hero, greater than Hercules. His history is won-,lerful. If we had never heard of it before, and

David was a noble general; he was brave and
generous; and his life is as pleasant to read as a
novel. And then Ezra and Nehemiah were two
fearless, independent men, who loved their country,
and delivered their city from being a ruin.

2526            AN INTRODUCTION
Hilary. I never thought of this before. But,
uncl, I am not like Ernest; I do not care half so
much about fighting, and armies, as he does. When
I read in Caesar about his wars, I am wearied out.
I am fond of adventures. I like the Arabian Nights,
and Gulliver's Travels, and Robinson Crusoe; but
mother takes them away from me, because they
are untrue.
Uncle. Very right. Some children would read
nothing else, if they were not checked. But take
the Bible, and study it well, and you will read
abundance of adventures and wonders too. But
take notice of this--they are all true. God himself assures us that they are all true.
lilary. Perhaps I have skipped them when I
have read in the Bible.
Uncle. No. I understand how it is. I also
used to consider it a dull and tedious book; but
the more I read in it, the more interesting it grows.
You can hardly open it without finding some wonderful narrative. The history of our blessed Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ is exceedingly wonderful
and affecting too. His birth at Bethlehem-his
miracles--his feeding thousands-his stilling the
tednpest-his raising the girl, and the widow's son,
and Lazarus-all are most delightful histories.
And then what did you ever read so wonderful as
his trial, his crucifixion, his resurrection, his ascenTO THE SCRIPTURES.
sion, his appearing to Stephen, and to Saul, and
to John?
Hilary. Are there such wonderful things in the
first part of the Bible?
Uncle. Surely there are. Have you never read
of Daniel in the lion's den-of Elijah and Enoch,
who were carried to heaven without ever dying--
of the army of Gideon--of the sun and moon standing still-of the manna--of the pillar of cloud-of
the flood-of the tower of Babel? Then of all the
histories I ever read, I never saw any one so interesting and affecting as that of Joseph. It is hard
to read it without weeping.
Hilary. I wonder then that people do not read
the Bible more.
Uncle. So do I. It is strange to see how ignorant many in this Christian land are about this
sacred book. Some who pass for educated men
and women are as ignorant as the rest. They
cannot tell how many books are in the Bible,
though they pretend to read in it every day. They
cannot tell who wrote it, or when it was written,
or how many languages it was written in. They
do not know where the places are that are mentioned in Scripture. And while they are so ignorant, they cannot take any interest in the book.

Ernest. Uncle, I wish you would tell us some
of these things, for I am one of these ignorant
people. I know the Bible is a box of precious
jewels; but I cannot open it.
IUncle. I must try to give you a key. And it
will be a great pleasure to me to show you and
Hilary how you may enjoy this treasure.
Hilary. O do so, dear uncle; for I begin to see
that I have never thought enough of this book.
Uncle. You must not expect me to tell you all I
have to say in a single day, or even a single week.
We will converse about this matter every day, and
a little at a time. Then you will not be weary.
There is one great reason why we should prize
the Bible above all other books. I suppose you
can guess what I mean.
Ernest. It is God's book.
Uncle. That is the very thing I meant. It is
God's own book. It is the only book which was
written by inspiration.
Hilary. What is inspiration?
Uncle. I mean that the good men who wrote
the Scriptures did not themselves find out the things
which they wrote. They did not make up the
Scriptures by their own wisdom. They wrote
down what God told them. God put the things
into their minds, and kept them from making mis
takes. That is, God inspired them. This teach
28TO THE SCRIPTURES.
ing is called inspiration.  "Holy men of God
spake as they were moved (inspired) of the Holy
Ghost." 2 Pet. i. 21.
Ernest. Then we are sure every word in the
Scriptures is true.
Uncle. Yes; every word; just as true as if God
were to speak it to us from heaven.
Ililary. Is this the reason why the Bible is sometimes called the Word of God?
Uncle. It is so. It is the message of God to
men.
Hilary. But some of the things in the Bible are
spoken by wicked people, like Judas Iscariot, and
even by Satan.
Uncle. Very true. God gives us the account
of what is thus said by the wicked. And God's
account of what they said is true, even if the words
of the wicked men or the devil are not true. If
you were to hear, that on a certain day God would
speak out of heaven, and tell you what his will is;
would you not be very serious? Would you not
be anxious to hear what might be said?  Would
you not believe every word?
Ernrest and Ililary. O, yes!
Uncle. If God, instead of speaking out of heaven,
were to write down his holy law with his own
hand, would you not think it very precious?
Would you not read it again and again?
3*
29AN INTRODUCTION
Both. Yes.
Uncle. But God did write the commandments
in this very way, and he gave them to Moses;
and we have a copy of them, made by Moses, in
the twentieth chapter of Exodus.
Hilary. O! I never considered that. It is so
indeed.
Uncle. But suppose, instead of writing with his
own hand, God should instruct a holy man, and
inspire him to write down his own will on paper,
And suppose this paper should be put into your
hands. What should you think of it?
Ernest. I think I should read it till I knew all
that was in it.
Uncle. This is just what God has actually done.
He instructed the prophets and apostles by his
Holy Spirit. Hie inspired them to tell us his truth
and his will. He kept them from all mistakes.
And they wrote down the words of God. And the
book containing what they wrote is put into our
hands. And this book is the Bible.
Hilary. Then the Bible is a great deal better
than all other books.
Uncle. Indeed it is. It gives us an account of
things which no mortal could ever have found out,
unless God had inspired him. And it teaches us
about the Son of God, and what he said and did
when he was upon earth.
30TO THE,. 1RIPTURES.
Hilary. What an honour it was to hear Christ
talk!
Ernest. Uncle, I often think I should have loved
to see Christ, and to hear him teaching.
Uncle. Suppose you knew a man who had heard
Jesus preach; would you not desire him to tell you
what our Saviour said?
Ernest. Yes; I think I would travel a great
way to see such a man.
Uncle. But suppose this man should save you
the trouble of travelling to see him, and should
write you a letter. And suppose he should put
down in this letter a great many things that Christ
said.
Hilary. Why, uncle Austin, such a letter would
be worth a thousand dollars.
Uncle. Boys, take notice--there were a number
of men who heard Christ preach.
Ernest. 0, yes-the apostles; but they are
dead.
Uncle. The apostles heard the blessed Saviour,
and learned the truth from his own lips. They are
dead, I know. But some of them did exactly what
I imagined. They have written to us. And they
have put down in their writing a great many things
that Christ said.
Ililary. I understand you, uncle. You mean
the gospels.
3132           AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. Matthew and John were apostles; they
wrote down what the blessed Saviour said, and
what he did, and here we have it all in the New
Testament. Mark and Luke were pious men,
who were always with the apostles, and who were
inspired to write the same. Read what Luke says
about his knowledge of Christ. Luke i. 2-4.
James, and Peter, and Jude were apostles who
also wrote. And Paul was inspired to write more
than all the rest. So you see the Bible is a great
and lovely book.

times-The book of greatest wisdom-Folly of heathens and

THE winter of which I am writing was very
severe. On the morning following the conversation just related, the ground was covered with a
deep snow, so that the boys were forced to remain
in the house. This gave their uncle a good opportunity to teach them many useful things. lWhen
they arose from breakfast, he conducted the two
brothers into his study, and said, " Well, my young
friends, you see there is no out-door amusement
for you to-day. You must make yourselves contented with the company of an old man, in the
hlouse. Anld let me say to you, we ought to be
thankful that we have a roof over our heads.
Many poor creatures, on this cold day, have no
dwelling-place, and scarcely any clothing. The
snow, which keeps us in the house, is useful to the
fields of grain. The farmers tell us, that in winters when no snow falls, the grain is often injured
The snow and the rain are both wisely and mercifully sent, in their season, by the Creator."
3334            AN INTRODUCTIO0
Ernest. I have heard it said that it never rains
in Egypt.
lUncle. That is true, to a great extent. Neither
rain nor snow ever falls in that country, unless on
some very rare occasion. As to snow, they do
not know what it is. The great river Nile, by
overflowing its banks, waters the earth, and makes
rain unnecessary. Look at the map. This is one
of the most wonderful countries in the world.
When Greece was a barbarous region, and when
there was no such city as Rome, thousands of years
before America or even Great Britain was discovered by civilized men, Egypt was a great kingdom. You have heard of the pyramids. No oneTO THE SCRIPTURES.            35
*-nds of years ago. The first we read about Egypt
v in the Scriptures.
Hilary. Why, is the Bible so old as that!AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. The books of Moses contain the earliest
history in the world; and the Bible is the oldest
book in the world. This is one thing which renders it so interesting. No other book can tell us
any thing about the creation of the world. But the
Bible gives us God's own account of the way in
which all things were first made. It tells us how
the whole human family descended from one pair.
It relates to us the destruction of the world by a
flood of water. It informs us how the sons of
Noah and their descendants settled the various
parts of the earth.
Ernest. I thought some of the Greek and Latin
books were very ancient.
Uncle. So they are, but not to be compared to
the books of Moses. Homer is the oldest Greek
poet, but no one pretends that he lived earlier thanl
the year nine hundred and fifty before Christ, and
that is only about the time of king Asa. Herodotus
is the oldest Greek historian, and he lived much
later still, about four hundred and fifty years before
Christ, that is about the time of Nehemiah.
Hilary. Should we not know any thing about
these old times, if we had no Bible?
Uncle. We should have no certain knowledge.
No one could tell the age of the human race, without the Bible. We should have nothing but the
ridiculous fables of the heathen, which boys read
36TO THE SCRIPTURES.
in Greek and Latin books, and which are too ridiculous to be mentioned. But, my dear boys, this
history is but a small part of what this blessed book
contains. It is written by the inspiration of the
all-wise God. All that is in it is true. But, more
than this, all that is in it is most wise. It is the
book of wisdom. All the wise men on the earth
could not produce such a book.
Hila?y. Our teacher says that Socrates was a
very wise man.
Uncle. He was wise for a heathen; but any
Sunday-school child in America, who has been
well taught, knows more about God than Socrates
did. And the Bible makes the difference. Solomon was a wise king, and he says, " He that walketh with the wise shall be wise." That is, if you
want to get wisdom, you must keep company with
those who have it. Now if you knew that the
very wisest man in the world was going to open a
school, would you not like to go to him to be his
scholars?
Ernest. Yes, because I should know that he
would never make any mistakes, or teach me any
thing wrong.
Hilary. Yes, and if he was so wise, he would
teach us the very best things, and would not teach
us useless things.
Uncle. Then you ought, for this very reason.

to learn from the Bible. When you read the Bible,
you are reading the wisdom of the wisest men.
Yes, you are reading the wisdom of the all-wise
God. It is just as if you conversed with the wisest
of all teachers. This book will never lead you
into mistakes; it will never teach you any thing
wrong. It will teach you the very best things, in
the very best way. It will never teach you any
thing trifling, vain, or useless.
Ernest. But is there not a great deal of wisdom
in other books?
Uncle. I do not despise other books. I read
many of them, and they help me to understand the
Scriptures. But they do not tell me how my soul
is to be saved. And besides, all the true knowledge
which is in the world about God and about religion,
comes from God. It was revealed by him. And
if we had no Bible, we should have hardly any of
it. Much of the wisdom of the heathens was
learned from the Jews, who had the Scriptures.
Ernest. Do you think, if we had no Bible, we
should be heathen'
Uncle. Certainly; either heathen or infidels.
We should be either idolaters or atheists. This
is just the fact where the Bible has never been
known. The people are "without God."  Those
fine writers, whose works you read at school,
such as Homer and Virgil, were heathen. The
38TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Greeks had thirty thousand gods. The Romans
were as bad.
Hilary. That is very strange! Why, had they
no more sense than this? Any little child knows
better now.
Uncle. Yes, any Christian child. But, Hilary,
you yourself would not know any better, if you
had not received it from the Scriptures. I have
been in countries where the people know nothing
about the true God; they worshipped hundreds of
horrid images. This was because they had no
Bible.
Ernest. But surely, my dear uncle, you think
that the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and the Greeks
had some wisdom.
Uncle. Yes, my son; you are right. These
ancient nations had learned men among them. The
Chaldeans used to live in their wide-spread
plains, where they could see the heavenly bodies
with ease; and so they became astronomers. But
take notice, they worshipped these very things.
They adored the sun, the moon, and the stars, and
denied the one true God. And the Greeks worshipped dead men whom they called heroes, and,false gods whom they described as abominably
wicked. And the Egyptians worshipped hawks,
serpents, cats, crocodiles, monkeys; yes, and even
the leeks and onions in their gardens.
39AN INTRODUCTION
Ernest. O, horrible!
Hilary. They were no better than fools.
Uncle. Such fools we should be, if God had not
in infinite mercy given us his inspired truth. T'he
wise heathen were fools in these great matters.
So the apostle Paul says of them, "Professing
themselves to be wise, they became fools, and
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an
image made like to corruptible man, and to birds,
and four-footed beasts, and creeping things." Rom.
i. 22, 23.
Ernest. I heard a Mr. Bald say that nobody
needs the Bible now.
Uncle. Why not  
Ernest. He said that there were wise men who
could give us as much light as the Bible. He said
that he knew people whom he called philosophers,
and that they could tell us every thing we need
know about our duty, and the way to be happy.
Uncle. This was foolish and wicked talk. If
this Mr. Bald had been born in China, he would
be a heathen. Why is he not a heathen?
Hilary. Because he lives in a Christian land.
Uncle. What gives more light to this Christian
land-more than there is in China?
Hilary. It is the Bible.
Uncle. Then does not Mr. Bald get much of
his light and knowledge from the Bible?
40TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Ernest. Yes; for if there had been no Bible,
he would have been no better than the Chinese.
It is the Bible which makes his philosophers know
the little they do know.
Uncle. A man once took a lantern, and put a
lamp into it, and lighted it, and set it on a post in
the middle of a field. Then he called his wife and
children, and said to them, " W4hat a wonderful
light!  Look, you can see all the trees and houses
for a mile around!" His wife smiled, and said,
"Yes, but the sun is shining with all his glory,
for it is noonday."
Ernest. The man was silly.
Uncle. Yes; he was almost an idiot. He thought
his lantern made the day. But infidel philosophers,
like Mr. Bald, are quite as silly. They make
speeches, and write books, and say, " What a wonderful philosophy we have! What a light!" and
all the while it is the Bible which makes the light,
and gives them the little knowledge they possess.
Ernest. Mr. Bald does not do his duty, even if
he does know what it is. For I heard him curse
and swear.
Uncle. This is the reason why most infidels
hate the Bible; they hate the pure law of God
which it contains. They do not wish to do their
duty. The Bible tells us what we owe to God
4*
41AN INTRODUCTION
Our duty is what God requires of us. It is hard
to find this out without revelation.
Ernest. Sometimes I do not know whether
what I am doing is right or wrong.
Uncle. If God were to speak in a voice of thunder from heaven, and say, " This is thle way, walk
ye in it," you would at once know what your duty
is. Now God has done as much as this: for in
the Scriptures he has given us a rule to direct us
how to please him. The Bible tells us plainly
what we must do, and what we must not do. This
is what no heathen philosopher, and no proud infidel, could tell us.
Ernest. I suppose the heathen did not know
what becomes of people when tney die.
Uncle. They could only guess. They had a
hundred different notions about the world to come.
Some thought the soul died with the body. Some
thought the soul passed from one body to another,
through a great number of animals. Some thought
there was a place under the earth where the good
were happy, and where the wicked were tormented.
Many of them wished for immortality, but could
not be sure of it. It is this sacred volume which
explains the great secret. You can nowhere else
find it explained. Here you learn how to overcome the fear of death. Here you see death con
quered. Here you have an account given of heavenTO THE SCRIPTURES.
an(l hell, of judgment and eternity. Is not this then
the most important book in the world?
Ernest. Yes, indeed: I see it to be so. And
I think there is one thing more you might have
said.
Uncle. What is that?
Ernest. The Scriptures tell us how to get to
heaven.
Uncle. You say well. THE WAY TO BE SAVED
is the great thing in which every human being is
concerned. Here you learn the way. Christ is
the way, the truth, and the life. The Holy Scriptures explain to us how Jesus came as a Saviour.
Life and immortality are brought to light by the
gospel. Only the Scriptures show us how we may
find pardon for our sins. This is the glory of the
whole book.
Hilary. But does the Old Testament tell about
Christ?
Uncle. Yes, my dear boy. The Old Testament
is full of instructions about Christ. These are not
so clear as those in the New Testament, but the
New Testament shows us the meaning of the Old.
All the sacrifices were signs of the sacrifice of
Christ. The prophets prophesied of Christ. And,"Jesus Christ is the sum and substance of the
Scriptures."
43AN INTRODUCTION
After these remarks, uncle Austin arose, and
told the boys that he wished to spend an hour or
two in reading. He therefore gave them permission to go into the parlour, and amuse themselves
with such exercises as they could take within
doors.
Ernest and Hilary played until they were fatigued,
and then sat down to talk. It was very natural for
them to speak of what their uncle had said.
Iilary. I do not wonder that they call him the
Bible man, for uncle seems to think of nothing
else.
Ernest. But this does not keep him from doing
a great deal of good. There are many poor families around Oakdale whom he visits every week.
Whnen the neighbours are sick, he supplies them
with food and medicine.
Hilary. He ought to have been a minister.
Ernest. People can do a great deal of good
without being ministers. Some persons would not
listen to what uncle Austin says, if they knew him
to be a minister. But now, when they know that
he is a rich old gentleman, they attend to what he
teaches them. He has three Sunday-schools in
this neighbourhood.
Hilary. Surely he does not teach them himself!
Ernest. No, not exactly. He set them up, and
persuaded some of the pious young people to be44TO THE SCRIPTURES.               45
come teachers. Then he gave them little lil:raries
to begin with, and every Lord's-day he visits some
one of them.
Hilary. Now I am sure that the Bible does not
make ally one dull or cross. Uncle Austin is the
very kindest old gentlemen I ever saw. Ernest, I
think we must read a little in the Bible every day.
E?rnest. Wait a little; if you think so now, you
will think so much more after you have been here
a few days. But I hear uncle's little bell ringing.
John is going to get his horse. We must run and
help to get him ready for riding out.AN INTRODUCTION

ANOTHER day came, and it was a very agreeable
day for the boys, for they had a house full of their
young cousins, who were invited to dine with them.
They enjoyed many sports and many conversations
among themselves, and their uncle came into their
gay circle, now and then, with a smiling countenance, making them useful presents, and giving
them good advice. But though the day was so
pleasant, yet Ernest and Hilary agreed that they
should be glad for the next day to come, that they
might hear something more in the study.
The next morning, as usual, they were called
into the study. A large and beautiful book lay
upon the table in the middle of the room. Uncle
Austin said to them, " Boys, open that book.
Ernest. It is a beautiful Bible! It is the largest
I ever saw.
46TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Hilary. The print is so large, that one could
almost read it across the room.
Uncle. I brought it with me from England. It
was printed at Oxford. I find it very pleasant for
my old eyes. Now look at it, and tell me into
what parts it is divided.
Ernest. O, I know that very well. There are
two parts--the Old Testament and the New Testament.
Uncle. Yes; these are the two great divisions
of the Scriptures. Both these together make up
the Bible.
Hilary. But we speak of the Bible and the Testament. Is the Testament a part of the Bible?
Uncle. It is a vulgar error. Ignorant people call
the Old Testament the Bible; and they call the
New Testament the Testament.
Ernest. -They ought to say the Bible for the
whole; the Old Testament for the first part, and
the New Testament for the other part. Hereafter
I shall try to remember.
Uncle. Take notice, there are two Testaments,
arld these two Testaments make the Bible. Instead
of saying the Testament, say the New Testament.
Ernest. But what does Bible mean?
Uncle. Bible is a word derived from the Greek.
Biblia in Greek means the Books. Biblia in Latin
means the same. These words are in the plural
47PREFACE.
THE great end of all religious teaching
would be attained, if men could be brought
to read the Bible aright. No books, therefore, are unimportant, which point to the
Holy Scriptures. Such is the present attempt,
which is expressly dedicated to the YOUNG.
It is intended for excitement as well as instruction; not only to communicate information and explain difficulties, but to offer inducements for the study of the Bible.
When a copy of our English Bible is placed
in the hand of an inquiring, but uninstructed
young person, there naturally arise a number
of interesting questions. Is this the work of
one, or of many hands? Is it an original
work, or a version? At what times and in
what tongue was it written? Into what languages has it been translated.? What is the
history of our common version? How am I
to interpret the division into books, chapters,

number.  The English word Bible means the
Book. We call the Scriptures the Book, because
they are the best of books.
Ernest. Are there not other names?
Uncle. Yes; the Bible is called the Scriptures,
or writings: the Holy Scriptures, or holy writings,
because it was written by inspiration of God's Holy
Spirit. In the Scriptures themselves, we do not
find the name Bible. But the common names there
given are the Scriptures, the Law, (the Word of
God.) Turn to Psalm cxix.
Ernest. Here it is; it has a hundred and seventysix verses!
Uncle. Yes; and every verse has something in
honour of the Scriptures. The psalmist had rot
half so much of the Bible as we have, but he loved
what he had. Just see how many names he gives
the law of God in this one psalm. I will read
them. The Law of the Lord-God's Testimonies-Precepts--Statutes--Commandments-Judgments-God's Word, (ver. 9. 11. 16. 25. 41-43.
58. 65. 101. 114. 133. 140. 158. 160, 161. 170;)
God's Words- the Law of God's mouth.
Ernest. But some Bibles have another part between the Old and the New Testaments.
Uncle. That is what is called the ypocrypha
It is not inspired. It is no part of God's revelation
Some of it is good, and some of it is bad; but it is
48TO THE SCRIPTURES.
not Scripture. Let me ask you a question: Is this
the language in which the Bible was written at
first?
Ernest. No, sir, I suppose not.
Uncle. Ernest, you surely know in what language the New Testament was written.
Ernest. Yes, sir, in the Greek language; for I
have to read the Greek Testament with my teacher.
Uncle. Very well. Then you have only to
learn that the rest of the Bible was written in Hebrew. These two languages, Hebrew and Greek,
are the two which God chose to give us his revelation in.
Hilary. Why did God select these languages?
Uncle. Hebrew was the language of the patriarchs, and of the Israelites, who were the people of God, and the only people on earth who ha(d
a revelation.  Greek was the language most extensively used in the world at the time of our Saviour.
But I shall say more of these things at another time.
Hilary. Was the Old Testament all written by
the same person?
Uncle. O, no; by no means: by more than
twenty different inspired men. People are apt to
fall into a great mistake about this. When they
see all in one volume, they think it is all one composition. But the truth is, the Bible is made up
of a large number of separate books.
&amp;
49AN INTRODUCTION
Hilary. Then I suppose they were not written
all at once?
Uncle. Not at all. They were written at different times. From the time at which the first
book of the Old Testament was written till the
time the last book was written, is more than a
thousand years; and from the first book in the
Bible till the last, there is more than nineteen hundred years.
Hilary. Is it possible! Then the book of
Genesis is almost two thousand years older than
the book of Revelation!
Uncle. Exactly so. You see that you might
take out each of these separate parts, and make a
little volume of it by itself. It would be a little
library of itself. There you would have some
books by Moses, some by Solomon, some by Ezra,
and so on. Now look at this Bible, and tell me
how many books it contains.
Hiilary. I will count them. There are just
sixty-six, beginning with Genesis and ending with
Revelation.
Ern-est. Yes; there are thirty-nine in the Old
Testament, and twenty-seven in the New Testament.
Uncle. Now remember what you learned just
now. The first division we make is into the two
Testaments. This is very simple; you cannot
50TO THE SCRIPTURES.
forget it. But let us take the Old Testament, and
see if we cannot make some convenient division
of it.
Ernest. Yes, into thirty-nine separate books.
Uncle. Very true; but we can make a division
more easy to be remembered.    Some of these
thirty-nine books relate histories: let us call these
historical. Some of them are poems, like the
Psalms, or books of instruction, like Ecclesiastes:
let us call these doctrinal or poetical. The remainder are predictions of things to come: let lis
call these prophetical.
Ernest. See if I understand you. The Old
Testament is divided into three parts:
I. The Historical Books.
II. The Doctrinal or Poetical Books.
III. Tlhe Prophetical Books.
Hilary. Will you inform me which are in each
of these divisions?
Uncle. The historical books are seventeen.
namely, 1. Genesis. 2. Exodus. 3. Leviticus.
i. Numbers.    5. Deuteronomy.     6. Joshua.
7. Judges. 8. Ruth. 9. The first book of Samuel.
10. The second book of Samuel. 11. The first
book of Kings.  12. The second book of Kings.
13. The first book of Chronicles. 14. The second
b,ok of Chronicles. 15. Ezra. 16. Nehemiah.
17. Esther.
51AN INTRODUCTION
The doctrinal or poetical books are five:
namely, 1. Job. 2. Psalms. 3. Proverbs. 4. Ecclesiastes. 5. The Song of Solomon.
The prophetical books are equal in number to
the historical, seventeen: namely, 1. Isaiah. 2. Jeremiah. 3. Lamentations. 4. Ezekiel. 5. Daniel.
6. Hosea. 7. Joel. 8. Amos. 9. Obadiah. 10. Jonah.  11. Micah.   12. Nahum.  13. Habakkuk.
14. Zephaniah.  15. Haggai.    16. Zechariah.
17. Malachi.
Ernest. Can we divide them any further?
Uncle. It is not very necessary. But you may
as well learn now, as at any other time, that the
first five historical books were written by Moses.
They are sometimes called the books of Moses.
The Jews called them the Law. They are also
called the Pentateuch, a Greek word, meaning
"five books," or " five volumes."
The prophetical books are also divided into the
greater and the lesser. The greater prophets are
the first four,-Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and
Daniel. The lesser or minor prophets are all the
rest.
Ernest. Were these books in separate volumes?
Uncle. The Jews always had the Pentateuch in
one book, which they called the Book of the Law.
But I shall show you that the ancient books were
not like our's. They were rolls of skin, and looked
52TO THE SCRIPTURES.              53
more like a map upon rollers, than any thing
else.
Hilary. Did you not say that all the Old Testament was written in Hebrew?
Uncle. I did. But there is a little exception to
be made. There is a language called Clhaldee,
which was spoken in Chaldea, where the Israelites
were carried away captive. A very small part of
the Bible is in this language. But the Chaldee
parts are only a few pages in all.*
Hilary. I wish to see what the Hebrew looks
like.
I The following parts are in Chaldee:-Daniel ii. 4- vii
Etra iv. 8-vi. 18; vii. 12-26. Jer. x. 11.
5*AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. Very well; let me write down the first
verse in the Bible in Hebrew for you.: Y) rlN1 nmi O'DW nN D'9 R N1: ntVN.
There you have it. But you can see it better in a
Hebrew Bible. Take this Hebrew Bible, and examine it, with the points.
Hilary. Uncle, the title-page seems to be at
the end.
Uncle. What you call the end is the beginning.
The Hebrews always began at the right hand of
the page when they wrote, and not, as we do, at
the left hand. So that the first page is where the
last would be in an English book.
Ernest. Whereabouts is the Hebrew language
spoken?
Uncle. Pure Hebrew is not spoken anywhere
on earth at this time. It is read by the Jews, and
by many learned Christians.
Ernest. But it was spoken in old times?
Uncle. Yes; it was spoken by the Hebrews,
and especially by the Israelites. Many good men
believe that Adam and Eve spake Hebrew, and
that it was Hebrew which God taught them.
Ernest. Then it is the oldest of all languages.
Uncle. It is. We do not know of any older
language. Many languages are derived from it.
It was spoken by all the people of Palestine; by

the Phenicians, north of Palestine; by the Canaanites; and, it is said, by the Carthaginians, who
were originally Phenicians. But, besides this, I
have no doubt it was once the language of the great
nations all around Palestine. During the seventy
years of captivity, the Hebrews lost much of their
own language, and borrowed much from the Chal.
dee, which was very nearly like Hebrew. But
the difference was such, that the Bible was ex
plained in Chaldee for the use of the Jews.
Hilary. Do the Jews understand Hebrew?
Uncle. At the present day, only a part of the
Jews understand Hebrew perfectly. There are
learned men among them who are great Hebrew
scholars; but many of them read the words without knowing very well what they mean. Have
you ever been at the Jewish synagogue?
Hilary. Yes, sir, we have both been to the
synagogue in New York. We heard them read
and sing, for several hours, in a very strange language.
Uncle. That was Hebrew. Every Jew is taught
in his childhood to pronounce the language. They
honour the Old Testament, and read some part of
it in the synagogues every Sabbath. They have
done this for two thousand years. They have the
Pentateuch divided into fifty-four sections, and they
read one of these every Saturday.
56TO THE SCRIPTURES.              57
Ernest. Do they read nothing but the Law?
Uncle. Yes; they read in the prophets, also.
About a hundred and sixty years before Christ,
Xntiochus forbade them to read the law. They
therefore took fifty-four sections of the prophets,
and read them. When they were again allowed
to read the law, they continued to read the prophets also.
iilary. When I go again to the synagogue, I
will pay more attention to what they do.
Uncle. That will be right. But now we must
think of some other business for the morning. I
am afraid you think all this very dry. But you
should remember that it is very useful. And after
a few more conversations, I shall have something
much more entertaining to teach you.'rhe boys thanked their good uncle, and left his
study, to go and prepare for a visit they were about
to make to the neighbouring village.and verses; the numerous marginal notes;
and the peculiarities of typography? How
may it be studied to the best advantage?These are inquiries which even children of
inquisitive minds are prompt to make; and
which even intelligent teachers are sometimes
at a loss to satisfy. It is such questions that
the following work professes to answer.
There are numerous works on these sublects addressed to the learned; but they are
beyond the reach of common readers. There
are also many treatises which direct to the
proper study of the sacred text. But it is
believed, that there is not in our language
any book which presents at one view exactly
the field which is here exhibited. In justification of this remark, the reader is requested
to examine the contents of the chapters from
the sixth to the eleventh, inclusively.
The form of the work may seem to demand
some explanation. It is by no means a fictitious composition, or a mere book of amusement. Yet, as some of the matters treated,
however important, are in themselves somewhat dry, the author has spared no pains to
render it attractive and even entertaining

The New Testament-Why written in Greek-Period betweei

reading the Bible in the original-How the Moslems read the

THE next conversation was about the second
great division of the Bible, or, the New Testament.
The boys were seated in the study before a good
fire, when their uncle began thus:
Uncle. Yesterday I explained to you several
things about the Old Testament. To-day I mean
to talk about the New Testament.
Ernest. What is the meaning of Testament?
Uncle. It means covenant. This second part
of the Bible is called the New Covenant by the
early Christian writers, just as the former part was
called the Old Covenant. You will find the words
used by Paul, in 2 Cor. iii. 6-18. Whether in
this place the apostle means the books, or only the
precepts and truths of the books, is not agreed.
Ernest. Why were the Scriptures called Covenants, or Testaments?
Uncle. Because they contain the revelation of
God's dealings with mankind, which are often
58TO THE SCRIPTURES.
called covenants. Especially the New Testament
contains the covenant of our salvation. The word
testament often means a last will, or the writing
by which a man leaves any thing to his heirs.
This book contains an account of the Christian
inheritance. The New Testament was written in
the Greek language.
Hilary. Why was it not written in Hebrew?
Uncle. For two reasons. First, because at the
time of our Saviour the Hebrew language was very
little spoken. Secondly, because the revelation
of God was now to be given, not to the Hebrews
alone, but to all nations.
Hilary. Did not Christ and the apostles speak
Hebrew?
Uncle. They no doubt knew the Hebrew; but
the colnmon language of Palestine, at that time,
was a dialect of Hebrew; that is a sort of Hebrew
much altered. It has sometimes been called SyroChlaldaic, because it was between Syriac and Chaldee. But the New Testament was not written in
this dialect, because it was understood in only a
small part of the earth.
Hilary. But why was the Greek language
chosen?
Uncle. Because it x*as read and spoken all over
the Roman empire. You must know that at that
time the Romans were the masters of all the civil59AN INTRODUCTION
ized world. They had conquered a large part of
Europe, Asia, and Africa. Palestine was under
their power.
Ernest. But was not Latin the language of the
Romans? Why was not the New Testament written in Latin?
Uncle. Latin was the Roman language, and it
was spoken in Italy; but Greek was more commonly used in all other parts of the Roman empire.
Every educated person learned Greek, even at
Rome. Juvenal tells us that ladies spoke Greek.
Cicero says the Greek was read in almost all nations. If any other language had been used, these
writings could not have been understood except in
one narrow- region.
Ernest. Does the New Testament begin just at
the time that the Old Testament ends?
Uncle. No; there is a period between the two
of more than four hundred years. Some very important events happened during this period. You
must know something of this in order to understand the Scriptures. It was during this period
that Asia was invaded by Alexander the Great;
that Judea was invaded by Antiochus, and that
Palestine was subdued by the Romans.
Ernest. There are twventy-seven books in the
New Testament. Now can we divide these, as
we did those of the Old?
60TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Uncle. Yes; and we may use the very same
division. Some of these books relate the history
of Christ and his apostles: let us call these historical. Some of them are letters containing Cllristian doctrine: let us call these doctrinal. The
only book left is the last in the Bible, which is a
book of predictions: let us call this prophetical.
Hilary. I will repeat. The New Testament is
divided into three parts:
I. Th1e Historical Books.
II. The Doctrinal Books.
III. The Prophetical Book.
Uncle. Now open your Bible. The historical
books are five; namely, the Gospels, and the Acts
of the Apostles.
The doctrinal books are twenty-one; namely,
1. The Epistle to the Romans. 2. The first Epistle to the Corinthians. 3. The second Epistle to
the Corinthians. 4. The Epistle to the Galatians.
5. The Epistle to the Ephesians. 6. The Epistle
to the Philippians. 7. The Epistle to the Colossians. 8. The first Epistle to the Thessalonians.
9. The second Epistle to the Thessalonians. 10. The
first Epistle to Timothy. 11. The second Epistle
to Timothy.  12. The Epistle to Titus.  13. The
Epistle to PhAlemon. 14. The Epistle to the Hebrews. 15. The Epistle of James. 16. The first
Epistle of Peter. 17. The second Epistle of Peter.
6
616'            AN INTRODUCTION
18. The first Epistle of John. 19. The second
Epistle of John. 20. The third Epistle of John.
21. The Epistle of Jude.
The prolhetical book is the Revelation of John.
Ernest. How many different persons were employed in writing these twenty-seven books?
Uncle. Eight persons.
Hilary. Were they all apostles?
Uncle. All except lIark and Luke, and these
were constant companions of the apostles. Mark
attended on Peter, and Luke on Paul.
Hilcry. Who wrote the most?
Uncle. The apostle Paul wrote more than any.
Next to him, the apostle John. Next, Luke. Then
Matthew, Mark, Peter, James, and Jude.
Ernest. Are the books placed in our Bibles in
the order in which they were written?
Uncle. No; you would greatly mistake if you
took up this notion. It is a common error. The
epistles are arranged after the histories. But some
of the epistles were written first. First come the
epistles of Paul, and then those of the other apostles. And the epistles of Paul are arranged according to their length; first that to the Romans, which
is his longest; and last, that to Philemon, which
is his shortest. The Epistle to the Hebrews is
not, indeed, taken into this arrangement, because it
has not the apostle Paul's name.TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Ernest. This is new to me. Are the other
epistles arranged in the same way?
Uncle. Very much in the same way; for James
is rather longer than the First of Peter; and the
epistles of John are arranged agreeably to their
length.
Hilary. Did our Saviour write any thing himself?
Uncle. We have no knowledge of his having
written any thing.
Hilary. I suppose that the epistles were written
at different times.
Uncle. Yes; and at different places. Learned
men differ as to the exact time when each book
was written, and we cannot be certain. I will show
you a list drawn up according to Dr. Lardner. You
will find another calculation in the Union Bible
Dictionary, under the word Epistles.
Ernest. Then there are forty-four years between
the first and the last book of the New Testament.
Uncle. Yes; if Dr. Lardner is right in his calculation. And you see that it was some time after
our Saviour's ascension into heaven that the first
of these books was written. Our Saviour ascended
in the year 33, and the Epistle to the Thessalonians
was written.in the year 52.
Hiezary. I wish to learn Greek much more than
I ever did before.
63TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Uncle. It is a fine language, and it is pat ticularly
useful, because the New Testament is written in it.
We call the Hebrew and the Greek the original
languages of Scripture, because the Bible was
originally written in them.
Ernest. Is not a translation into English just as
good as the Greek?
Uncle. We ought to be very thankful to God
that we have so good a translation; yet no translation can be quite equal to the original. There is
always something in the translation which is not
in the original; and there is always something in
the original which is not in the translation. And
therefore it is a good thing to know the original
languages.
Hilary. Did you not say that all the Jewish
children are taught to read in the Hebrew Bible?
Uncle. Yes; all learn to read the words, and,
in some countries, all learn to understand what
they read. A Jew would be ashamed not to know
the Hebrew letters. And among the Mohammedans, every boy is taught to read the Koran. The
Koran is the sacred book of all who follow Mohammed. It was written by him in the Arabic
language. And though many of the Mohammedans
live in countries where the Arabic language is not
spoken, yet they all learn to read the Koran in the
original.
6*
6'5AN INTRODUCTION;
Ernest. Why might we not learn to read Greek
in the same manner?
Unzcle. It is not likely that everybcdy can be
persuaded to learn it; nor is it tile duty of every
one. But many thousands might do so, who now
neglect it. People can learn French and Italian,
anid so they might learn Greek enough to under
stand the New Testament.
Ernest. I think it must be very delightful tG
know that you are reading the very words which
the inspired men wrote.
Uncle. Yes; it is so, indeed. And I hope you
will both be diligent in learning to do so. Then I
hope you will begin the Hebrew also. For there
is nothing which you ever learn at school half as
important as the Holy Scriptures.
Hilary. But before we know Hebrew and Greek,
what must we do?
Uncle. You will find enough to do, and that
which is very profitable and delightful. You have
this blessed English Bible, the very best translation
whicll was ever made, which has, with God's blessing, made so many thousands wise unto salvation.
Study this. Learn all about it. Read it every day
Commit portions of it to memory. Believe it.
Pray over it. Practise it. And you will then say,
as the psalmist said, 0 how I love thy law! it is
my meditation all the day. I love thy command66TO THE SCRIPTURES.
ments above gold, yea, above fine gold. The law
of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of
gold and silver.
Ernest. There is a question I should like to ask
about the names of some of the books. Why are
four of the historical books called Gospels?
Uncle. The word gospel is derived from two
Saxon words, god-good, and spel-word or news;
it therefore means good news. The Greek word
(Euaggelion) which means good news, is used to
express the glad tidings of M&amp;ssiah's coming. Matt.
xi. 5. Rom. i. 1, 2. The early Christians gave
this same name to the small books which contained
the history of Christ. These books are those of
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which are called
the gospels according to these writers; that is, the
history of Christ's blessed coming, as recorded by
these writers. From the same Greek word is derived the Latin for gospel, Evangelium; and from
this these writers are called the Evangelists.
Ernest. In the table which you showed us, (see
page 64,) all the epistles, except those of Paul, are
called catholic epistles. I do not know what this
means.
Uncle. It is a very ancient name, and I am not
sure that we know why it was first given. Catholic
means universal; thus the catholic church means
the universal church of Christ, and not the
67The dialogue offered an occasion for constant
change of subject, and for the suggestion of
many questions, which, in any other method
of composition, would have been an interruption to the discourse.
The subject is by no means exhausted.
Among the important topics which could not
be fillly treated within our narrow limits, are
such as the following: An analysis of each
book of Scripture; a key to Scripture difficulties, and especially to the prophetical writings; a catalogue of such books as are useful
aids to the Bible student; and a history of
the distribution of the Scriptures by Bible
Societies. These may be treated in a subse
quent volume.
It is the earnest desire and prayer of the
author, that these pages may be made the
means of promoting the interests of true religion, by inducing some, at least, to read the
best of books with increased profit and delight.

so called because they were not for indivi(luals,
but for the universal body of believers. Others
think they were so called, from their being universally received as Scripture.
Hilary. What is the meaning of apocalypse?
Uncle. It is only the Greek for Revelation.
And take care not to call this last book Revelationsr,

ON the next day, when Ernest and Hilary went
into their uncle's study, they were surprised to see
himn unrolling a great skin, which looked like a long
lnarrow map.
Uncle. This is not a map, as you might be ready
to suppose, but a book.
Hilary. A book!    Is it possible?  Why it has
no leaves and no cover. It looks more like a large
roll of sheepskin.
Uncle. So it is; nothing more nor less than a
laige roll of sheepskin; but still it is a book. Have
you never heard a book called a volume?
Hilary. 0, yes; often.
Uncle. Volume means something rolled up. In
old times books were rolled in this way, and were
called volumes or rolls: but I am going to tell you
a great deal more about this.  And if you will only
be attentive, I think you will be entertained.
69AN INTRODUCTION
Ernest. We will try to be attentive. But before
you go on any further, I should like you to tell me
who invented books and writing. Do you think
Adam could write?
Uncle. That is not revealed to us. Some persons think that Moses was the inventor of writing;
this is the common opinion. But I have always
thought it much more likely that the art of writing
was known long before Moses. I have already
told you, however, that the Pentateuch, as Moses'
works are called, is the oldest book in existence.
Hilary. Were all the ancient books written on
skins like this?
Uncle. Many of them were, but a great variety
of articles have been used to write upon; and I am
about to give you an account of these. It will help
you to understand many parts of the Bible. These
articles were of three sorts: 1. Vegetable substances; 2. Idnimal substances; 3. Mineral substances. I am unable, indeed, to inform you which
was the very earliest writing material, but I can
tell you of several which were certainly used by the
ancients.
FIRST. The leaves of trees. In the East Indies
the natives at this day write on leaves. In Tanjore and other countries, the palmyra leaf is used;
and they make the letters with a sharp piece of
metal like a bodkin. The people of Ceylon use
70TO THE SCRIPTURES.             71
thlle palm leaf, which is of immense size. They
cut out slips between one and two feet in length,
and when they have smoothed them, they write on
them with a steel pencil. They make holes in
these, and string them together; and thus they have
books. Pliny tells us that this was one of the most
ancient ways of writing.
SECONDLY. The bark of trees an(l plants. The
Greeks called this BIBLOS, whence the word BIBLIA,
whence our word BIBLE. Sometimes they did nothing to the bark but make it smooth. The philyra, a sort of linden tree, was muchA used for this
purpose, and even the bark of some oaks. The72            AN INTRODUCTION
Latin word Liber means the inner bark of a tree,
and also a book. But the ancients learned to prepare this into a sort of paper; by separating the
thin layers of bark, laying one on another with
some gum or paste, and then pressing them close.
This sort of paper was used in France, seven hundred years ago. The great fault of it was that it
blotted. The sacred books of the Burmans are
sometimes made of thin strips or slices of bamboo,
plaited together nicely, so as to make a smooth
leaf of the required size. In the island of Sumatra, south of Burmah, under the equator, the natives
use the bark of trees for writing.
THIRDLY. Wood itself has been employed for
books. Pliny tells us that table-books of wood were
in use before the days of Homer. Before the Chinese had invented their fine paper, they used thin
pieces of wood or bamboo, on which they marked
with an iron tool. And there are at Oxford some
specimens of ancient Arabic writing on boards abou'
two feet long and six inches wide. In Ezekie
xxxvii. 15, the Lord directs the prophet to wrTO THE SCRIPTURES.
on two sticks. These were no doubt such tablets
of wood. And the writing-table on which Zechariah wrote the name of John the Baptist, was a
tablet of wood. Luke i. 63. The ancient people
of Britain used to cut the letters on sticks having
three or four sides, and these sticks were fixed in
a frame. The Danes did the same, and the word
BOOK is derived from the old northern word Boc,
"beech," because they used beechen boards to,
write on. In the Apocrypha there is a remarkable
proof of the same thing. In second Esdras, chapter fourteenth, verse 24, we read of five men being
" ready to write swiftly" on " many box-trees," or
box-tables. And in verse 44, it is said, "' In forty
days, they wrote two hundred and four books." The
Romans had books of this sort, made of very thin
slips of board. And Dr. Shaw tells us, that in
Barbary, at the north of Africa, the children at
school learn to write on a smooth thin board,
daubed over with whiting, which may be easily
rubbed off. Thus they learn to read and write at
the same time.
Ernest. That is like what I have seen in a Lancasterian school.  The little boys had shallow
boxes or trays with sand in them, and they made
the letters in the san(d with a stick, and then rubbedi
them out again.
Uncle. These wooden tablets were sometimes
7
75~AN INTRODUCTION
covered with a coat of wax, and as many as five
or six were occasionally joined together like a
book. These were very useful when they did not
wish to preserve their writing.
Hilary. Then they answered the same purpose
as our states.
Uncle. Exactly. But they likewise wrote long
works on them. One of Plato's celebrated books,
called the Republic, was so written. They could
write very rapidly on these waxen tablets. Instead
of wood, they sometimes used ivory. The Romans
constantly carried such tablets with them, or very
rich men were followed by a slave called Tabellarius, who carried the writing materials. The
Tabellarius often carried letters written on these
waxed boards. I have seen a French song, written more than four hundred years ago, about 1376,
which runs thus:
Some with the antiquated style
On waxen tablets promptly write,
Others with finer pen the while,
Form letters lovelier to the sight.
Some French records of that age are still preserved on such tables. I will explain presently
how they marked on them.
Ernest. But had these ancient people no such
thing as paper?
74TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Uncle. They had. Let me therefore say,
FOURTHLY, Paper was used for writing. The
Egyptians were the first to use paper.~ It was
made of the celebrated papyrus, or a sort of flag or
bulrush which used to grow along the Nile, though
at present it is found chiefly in Syria, on the Euphrates, and in India.t The stem of the papyrus
is composed of long fibres or strings. It is naked
and slender, except at the top, where there is a
bunch or plume of leaves, not unlike hairs. It
rises sometimes to the height of twenty feet. Pliny
gives us a very particular account of the manner in
which the ancients made paper from this reed; and
Bruce, a modern traveller, has explained many
points concerning which we were before ignorant.
Ernest. Is our word paper from this name
papyrus?
Uncle. It is.  This is the first manufactured
paper of which we have any account. It was
made. from the inner bark of the stem, by dividing
it into thin slices or skins, as large as possible.
The middle skins or films were the most valuable.
T'hey laid these slender slips or slices flat on a

75AN INTRODUCTION
table, edge to edge; over these they laid a layer
crossing the former layer at right angles. They
put as many layers as they thought needful, and
moistened the whole with water. Then they
pressed it with great weights. The gummy juice
of the papyrus caused the slips to stick together into a firm sheet. When the juice was not
sufficiently adhesive, they used wheaten paste
After the sheets had been under press, they beat i,
with mallets, which smoothed and flattened it
This was the famous Egyptian paper.
Hilary. Was it used anywhere but in Egypt?
Uncle. Yes; it was exported into various coun
tries, especially into Italy. About the time of oui
Saviour's birth, it was one of the chief articles of
Egyptian and Roman commerce.
Ernest. How long ago did it go out of use?
Uncle. I cannot inform you with certainty.
think we may say about the middle of the seventh
century, when the Saracens subdued Egypt, and
thus broke up the paper trade.
Ernest. Are any books of this sort left?
Uncle. Nearly eighteen hundred writings on
papyrus have been found in the ruins of Herculaneum. And Bruce, the great traveller, brought
from Thebes, in Egypt, a fine specimen. I will
read to you what he says: "The boards," or
covers, "are of papyrus root, covered first witl
76TO aTHE SCRIPTURES.
the coarse pieces of the paper, and then with leather, in the same manner as it would be done now.
It is a book one would call a small folio, rather
than by any other name. The letters are strong,
deep, black, and apparently written with a reed, as
is practised by the Egyptians and Abyssinials still.
It is written on both sides."
Hilary. Then the papyrus books were not
rolls?
Uncle. This book of Bruce's was not. But
more commonly they were rolled. I have myself
examined a roll, taken out of the case of a mummy,
several thousand years old. It was exhibited in
Philadelphia in 1833. Most of the mummies have
such rolls.
Ernest. But are you not to tell us something
about writing on skins?
Uncle. I will do so. FIFTHLY. Tlhe skins of
animals were used for writing materials. Herodotus, the earliest Greek historian, who lived about
four hundred and fifty years before Christ, tells us
that the Phenicians wrote on sheep-skins. This
was one of the earliest inventions in the way of
writing. Skins are strong and lasting. In the
Pentateuch we find it said of a certain trial: " And
the priest shall write these curses in a book, and
he shall blot them out with water." Num. v. 23
Now this writing must have been on something
77AN INTRODUCT'ION
stronger than paper, which would go to pieces if
dipped in water. I think it must have been some
sort of skin or leather. We know that the Hebrews were able to dress skins in sopne ways, because they were much used in the tabernacle; and
they could probably dress them so as to take ink
or paint.
Ernest. Is not parchment made of skins?
Uncle. It is. But in very ancient times this
beautiful article was unknown. The skins which
they used were rougher and coarser, like the roll
which lies on the table.
Hilary. What is parchment?
Uncle. Parchment is commonly made of the
skins of sheep or goats. The sort which is called
vellum is very fine and delicate, and is made of
the skins of the very youngest calves.
Hilary. When was parchment invented?
Uncle. The common opinion is, that it was invented by Eumenes, king of Pergamus, about two
hundred years before Christ. Pergamus was a
great city of Asia Minor, now called Bergamo. It
was famous for a library of 200,000 volumes.
Ptolemy, king of Egypt, prevented this king from
having any papyrus, and' he therefore adopted this
sort of skin. It was called pergamena because it
was made at Pergamus; and parchment is derived from pergamena. Asses' skin was also used,
78TO THE SCRIPTURES.
likewise ivory, and even fish skins. And perhaps
Iyou will be amused to hear that old Cleanthes, a
Greek philosopher, who was too poor to buy paper,
used to write his master Zeno's lectures on shells
and bef bones. Gibbon says that the Koran of
Mohammed was taken down by his disciples not
only on palm leaves, but the shoulder bones of
mutton. But you need not reckon the shells or
the bones.
Ernest. Did not the ancients sometimes engrave
letters on plates of metal?
/Uncle. They did. The SIXTH material I shall
mention is lead. Read Job xix. 24. Montfaucon,
a very learned man, bought at Rome, in 1669, a
book with leaden leaves. In Greek and Latin writers you will often find, that poems and even laws
were engraven on very thin pieces of lead.
SEVENTH. Brass or copper was also used. Dr.
Buchanan found among the Jews of India several
tables of brass, containing deeds for the land which
they owned. The old Roman laws were sometimes thus written. In 1444, seven or eight brass
tablets with old Italian writings were dug up in
Italy.
EIGHTH. More precious metals. I have read
that the ancient records of France were on silver
tablets. In 1636, the Dutch received a letter in Arabic, from an East Indian prince, on tablets of gold.AN INTRODUCTION
Ernest. But I should think that stone would
have been used much earlier. The law of God
was on tables of stone.
Uncle. Yes, you are right. In all ancient countries we find monuments of stone, with writings
upon them. Sometimes they cut the letters very
deep, and filled them up with lime or cement. At
Rome there is a book with the leaves of thin marble. Job says, " O0 that my words were now written! O that they were printed (or graven) in a
book! That they were graven with an iron pen,
and lead, in the rock forever!" Job xix. 24.
When God called Moses up into Sinai, he said,
"I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and
commandments which I have written." Ex. xxiv.
12. These were "written with the finger of
God," (Ex. xxxi. 18,) and are the same which
Moses cast out of his hands and broke. Ex. xxxii. 19.
I'he Lord afterwards said to him " Hew thee two
tables of stone like unto the first." Ex. xxxiv. 1. On
these he again inscribed the law. The people also
received a command: " It shall be on the day when
ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the
Lord thy God giveth thee, that thou sh\alt set thee
up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
and thou shalt write upon them all the words of
this law." Deut. xxvii. 1-8.
80TO THE SCRIPTURES.
NINTH. Bricks.  These are found among the
ruins of Babylon.
TENTH. Linen, cotton, and silk. Linen books
have been found in the caves of Egypt. Livy mentions the like. There is a silk book preserved in
the Harleian library in England. And in Rome
there is a manuscript of the prophets on silk.
Ernest. Let me see if I can repeat the different
things you have mentioned.
Uncle. Begin with those made of trees orplants.
Ernest. Writing materials made of trees or plants
were five: (1.) Leaves; (2.) Bark; (3.) Wood;
(4.) Linen or cotton; (5.) Papyrus.
Uncle. Let Hilary mention those procured from
animals.
Hilary. Writing materials procured from animals were two: (1.) Skins, or parchment, or vellum; (2.) Silk.
Uncle. And then those which are from the mineral world are: (1.) Metallic plates, of gold, silver,
brass, copper, or lead; and, (2.) Stone.  And
now we may stop, as we have discovered something about the articles on which the ancients
wrote. Next we shall try to find out something
about their pens, their ink, and the fashion of their
books.

IF the reader is not weary of this subject, he may
find in this chapter an account of the conversation
which uncle Austin had with his nephews, about
the sorts of books which were used in old times.
And this is by no means a useless kind of knowledge, because it throws light on many parts of the
Holy Scriptures.
When the boys went, as usual, into the study,
they found that their good uncle was ready for
them. He was sitting near a small table, on which
he had spread a number of drawings, and several
curiosities which he had picked up in his travels.
Uncle. Which of you can tell what this is, which
I hold in my hand?
Hilary. It looks something like the reeds which
I have seen in tobacco-pipes.
Uncle. It is something of that sort, indeed. It
is a reed for writing. The Arabs and Turks constantly write with a reed of this sort. The an82TO THE SCRIPTURES.
cients used a reed when they wrote upon skins,
cotton, linen, or paper.
Ernest. Had they no quills to make pens of?
Uncle. Quills have long been used in Europe,
but when they were first introduced I cannot tell.
Those of geese, swans, peacocks, crows, and pelicans have been employed. The first mention I
can find of a pen, is about A. D. 636. They were
not known, however, in very ancient times, nor by
any of the scriptural writers. Where you find the
word pen in the English Bible, it means either a
rod of some kind, or a sharp instrument of metal.
Even after pens were introduced, reeds were used
for writing very large or ornamental letters. Here
is a Persian manuscript, see how broad and free the
long flourished letters are.
IIilary. Can it be possible that this was written!
It is as regular as printing.
Uncle. No printing (except lithography) can at
all imitate the elegance of oriental manuscripts.
And some of the Jews' rolls in their synagogues
are still more regular and beautiful. Here is a
little drawing I made from a picture which was
found in Herculaneum.   These pictures are at
least seventeen hundred years old.
Ernest. Then they will show us exactly the
sort of articles which were common among the old
Romans.
8384            AN INTRODUCTION.
Uncle. Exactly so. This is an inkstand, with
a reed lying on it, ready for use.
Hilary. rhe picture is precisely like the reed
yon have in your hand.
Uncle. The ink which was used with these
reeds was very different from ours. Pliny describes
various sorts. The most common was made of
lampblack, soot, or charcoal, with water and sometimes a little gum; so that it was much more like
shoe-blacking than ink.  Printing inkt gives you
some idea of it. They frequently used a hairpeancil to make the letters witli, as the Chinese do now.
The liquor of the sepia or black fish was used by
the later Romans. The Hebrews, like other easterm nations, used many colours besides black for
their writing. But the Greek word for illk in the
New Testament signifies black, and so does the
Hebrew word in Jer. xxxvi. 18. By referring to
the UNION BIBLE DICTIONARY, art. Book, you will
find another picture from Herculaneum. It represents an inkhorn or standish, in which there are
two partitions.TO THE SCRIPTURES.
Ernest. And you will see also the reed, already
cut and sharpened.
Uncle. When they made inscriptions on stone
or metal, it was done with a chisel or graver,
called in the Bible a pen of iron. Sometimes
these were sharpened with a diamond at the end,
like the instrument which glaziers employ to cut
glass. Job xix. 24. Jeremiah says: "The sin of
Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the
point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of
their heart." Jer. xvii. 1. Pliny mentions these
diamond points as having been long in use.
Hilary. How did they write on the waxed
tablets?
Uncle. With a hard instrument called a stylus
or style. This was broad at the top and pointed at
the bottom. When they wished to rub out, they
just turned the other end and made the wax smooth
again.
Hilary. Of what were the styles made?
Uncle. Sometimes of iron or steel; sometimes
of wood, brass, ivory, silver, or even gold. They
were used as daggers. Cesar drew his style and
wounded Cassius. The emperor Claudius was so
much in dread of being assassinated, that he would
not let the scribes or public writers bring their
styles into his presence. Cassianus, a Christian
schloolmaster, was, about the year 365, murdered
8
85AN INTRODUCTION
by his pupils with their styles, by order of the
emperor Julian. And now I think we have talked
enough about pens and ink.
Ernest. I am not weary, but I shall be glad to
come to books.
Uncle. I have already told you that when you
read in Scripture of books, you must not think of
such volumes as we now have, made of hundreds
of leaves of paper, stitched and pasted, and bound
and gilt. Most of the ancient books were rolls.
The skins, parchments, linen, cotton, silk, and
even papyrus, were thus rolled.
Hilary. Were these rolls very large?
Uncle. Of various sizes, as are our books. Usually
the roll was long, but narrow. When a very large
book was needed, many skins were joined together.
I have showed you a Jewish roll. I suppose the
books of the Old Testament were on rolls of the
same sort. When there was no room on one side
for more, they used to write on the other. This
explains a text in Ezekiel, (ii. 9:) "And when I
looked, behold a hand was sent unto me, and, lo, a
roll of a book was therein; and he spread it (unrolled it) before me; and it was written within
and without."
Hilary. Did the Greeks and Romans use such
rolls?
Uncle. They did. In Herculaneum many such

nave been found, and pictures of many more,
which give you a better idea of ancient books
than a talk of a whole day. By referring to an
engraving under the article before mentioned, you
will see how a book was held in reading. You
will also see that the writing was sometimes
across the roll; just as if you took a newspaper and
held it by the sides. Thus the book is in colamnF
or pages, theugh there is bult one leaf. In Jeremiah, (ch. xxxvi.) we read that Baruch, the prophet's
friend, took down his words with ink in a booX
that is, a roll. In ver. 20 it is called a roll. Jehudi
read it aloud to the kinlg; and when " he had read
two or three leaves," that is, such columns as you
see in the cut, " the king cut it with a penknife, and
cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until the
roll was consulned in the fire that was on the
hearth." ver. 23. By another engraving under
the same article, you will see another form of
holding the books to read them. This roll is
narrower than the other, and far narrower than
the Jewish rolls.
Ernest. Did our Saviour read in the synagogue
out of such books as this?
Uncle. Rather out of such a roll as I showed
you yesterday. When he came to the synagogue
at Nazareth, " there was delivered to him the book
of the prophet Esaias."  This was the roll which

Hilary. I always imagined that the writing on
these rolls was from one end to the other of the
long roll.
Uncle. Some were certainly so. We have another figure from Herculaneum, which represents a
nymph singing out of a book. You will see copied,
under the same article in the DICTIONARY, the
roll and the hands. You will see it was read
down the roll. You can also see that it is poetry,
and is divided into stanzas of six lines each.
Ernest. The Jewish roll which you showed us
yesterday is different from these in one respect. It
has rollers of wood like those on maps.
Uncle. Rollers are used in all the synagogue
rolls, and the ends of these are often highly ornamented with silver or gold. The ancients had the
same contrivance.  The rod or cylinder was of
ebony, cedar, cypress, box, bone, or ivory. The
ornamental caps at the projecting ends of the rollers were called the horns.
88TO THE SCRIPTURES.            s9
Ernest. I cannot understand what is meant by
the seals of books. How can a book be sealed?
Uncle. This is soon explained. Suppose I talke
that Hebrew roll, and wind a cord or band round
it, and put a little sealing-wax over the knot. The
book is then sealed. And I may seal it six or seven
times if I choose. Let me show you this in a little
drawing. Now you see that such a book could not
be opened without breaking the seal.
Hilary. And were letters sealed in the same
way?
Uncle. They often were; of course the rolls
were then smaller.  Take the Bible, and turn to
Isa. xxix. 11.
Hilary. " And the vision of all is become unto
you as the words of a book that is sealed, which
men dellver to one that is learned, saying,' Read
this, I pray thee;' and he saith,' I cannot, for it is
sealed.' "
Uncle. Read Dan. xii. 4.
Hilary. "But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the
words, and seal the book."
8*90            AN INTRODUCTION
Uncle. Read Rev. v. 1, and vi. 1.
Hilary. " And I saw in the right hand of him
that sat on the throne a book, written within
and on the back side, sealed with seven seals."
" And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the
seals."
Uncle. The roll was full, inside and outside,
and was fastened with seals which no one could
open.
Ernest. But were all the ancient books in this
form?
Uncle. No.. I have already told you that some
of them, but more rarely, resembled ours. Here is
another drawing from Herculaneum.TO THE SCRIPTURES.              91
Ernest. I suppose they did not put rolls up on
shelves as we do.
Uncle. No. They had various cases to keep
them in. Some of these were more like pails or
casks than book-cases. See here; this cut represents an ancient Roman scriniurm, or book-case.'rhe little labels at the top of the volumes contain
the titles.
Ernest. Do you suppose the epistles of Paul
and the other apostles were written on rolU?
Uncle. I have no doubt they were on rolls of
papyrus or parchment. The ancients had scribesAN INTRODUCTION
who wrote their letters. The person sending the letter, dictated, that is, told the secretary what to write.
The Romans called such a scribe an amanuensis.
Ernest. Did not Paul write his epistles with his
own hand?
Uncle. Not commonly. When he did so, he
mentions it as remarkable. Thus he says to the
Galatians: " Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand." Gal. vi. 11.
Hilary. How did they know then that such letters were not forged?
Uncle. Paul always added his name, or some
salutation in his own writing. "The salutation
of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
in every epistle." 2 Thess. iii. 17. "The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand." 1 Cor.
xvi. 21. And when he wrote a letter to the Romans, his secretary Tertius adds a kind salutation:
" I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in
the Lord." Rom. xvi. 22. In the Old Testament,
we find that Queen Jezebel " wrote letters in Ahab's
name, and sealed them with his seal." 1 Kings
xxi. 8. At the present day the letters of the orientals are oftener tied than sealed; and their books
are not commonly rolled, but made like ours. But
when a letter is sent to a great man, it is bound
in various costly envelopes, and sealed witl great
care.

All this I hope will give you a better idea of the
books of Scripture than you had before. You perceive that when any one had the whole Bible, he
had it often in a great number of little rolls. And
many had only a few of these. Let us bless God
that we have the whole, in a portable volume.AN INTRODUCTION

EVERY day that Ernest and Hilary spent with
their affectionate uncle, they learned something
new concerning the Holy Scriptures. They were
so much gratified with his conversations, that they
no longer needed to be called, but went every morning into his study without an invitation. And he
was equally pleased to receive them, for he had no
greater pleasure than to communicate useful knowledge to his young relations.
When he saw them coming in the next day, hc
began as follows:
I have already told you, my dear nephews, that
the books of the Bible were not all written at the
same time. The Old Testament books are sup.posed to have been collected and arranged by Ezra
And after that time, they were preserved by the
Jews with the greatest care.  They took all possi

ble measures to keep them from being altered in a
single letter. It was a long time before the New
TestamenD books were collected in the same way.
For many years they were circulating through different parts of the world, as separate volumes; and
there were comparatively few persons who possessed the whole Scriptures. At length the whole
were gathered, and acknowledged by all the church
as the genuine Scriptures.
Hilary. As they did not know how to print, I
suppose every one had to copy off the whole book
for himself.
Uncle. Some persons did so. But copying was
a regular trade in those days, just as printing is
now. And there were men who spent their whole
lives in copying, and who could write with a beauty
and regularity which are unknown at the present
day.
Ililary. How long did this continue to be the
case?
Uncle. Until the invention of printing in the
fifteenth century. Multitudes of monks in monaste'ies used to spend their lives in transcribing manuscripts. In the abbey of Marmoutier, the most
anicient that now remains in France, the monks
lived in separate cells. No art or business was
permitted among them except that of writing.
Fifty-eight volumes were copied in Glastonbury
95AN INTRODUCTION
in England, during the government of one abbot,
about A. D. 1300. This was the chief employment
of the Carthusian monks.
Ernest. How long it must have taken to write
off the whole Bible!
lTiJcle. It was tedious indeed; and this made books
exceedingly dear. Besides this, many of these ancient manuscripts were highly adorned. Some were
written in letters of purple, silver, or gold. Some
were ornamented with pictures around the principal capital letters, which were called illuminations.
I have seen many thus embellished. There is in
the Vienna library a copy of Genesis and of Luke,
about fourteen hundred years old. It is on purple
vellum, in letters of gold and silver.
Ernest. Were there Bibles in all the ancient
churches?
Uncle. There were; at least until the Romish
church forbade the reading of the Scriptures. Bibles
were placed in convenient places, within the church
walls, that the common people might come and
read when they chose.
Ernest. This was very well when books were
so expensive.
Uncle. The cost of books was greater than you
would suppose. A single anecdote will show this.
In the fourth century a monk named Hilarion went
in a ship from Lybia to Sicily. When he arrivedTO THE SCRIPTURES.
at his port, he offered to pay for his passage and
that of his companion, with a copy of the gospels
which he had written in his youth. The captain,
seeing they had nothing else, allowed them to go
free.
Sometimes the elegance of the cover or binding
made them more costly. Ina, king of the West
Saxons, gave to the church at Glastonbury, for the
" coverings of the books of the gospels," twenty
pounds and sixty pieces of gold. In 1430, an
English abbot paid for the binding of a single book
three pounds; and you must remember, that a
pound at that time would buy four cows or three
horses; so that he laid out the value of nine horses
on the cover of his book! It is just as if I should
give four or five hundred dollars for binding a
volume. In the reign of Henry II. the sheriffs of
London paid, by the king's order, twenty-two shillings for gold to gild the gospel used in the king's
chapel.
Hilary. I feel glad that we live when books are
cheaper.
Uncle. Yes, my son, we should be truly thankful that we are so favoured. In 609, Alfred, king
of Northumberland, gave eight hundred acres of
land for the History of the World. And the same
man who paid three pounds for covering his book,
paid five pounds for the copying of it. In the
