xvllTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST..Mazeppa.-BYRoN.
"'BRING forth the horse!"-the horse was brought;
In truth, he was a noble steed,
A Tartar of the Ukraine breed,
Who looked as though the speed of thought
Were in his limbs; but he was wild,
Wild as the wild deer, and untaught,
With spur and bridle undefiled-'Twas but a day he had been caught;
And snorting, with erected mane,
And struggling fiercely, but in vain,
In the full foam of wrath and dread
To me the desert-born was led:
They bound me on, that menial throng,
Upon his back with many a thong;
They loosed him with a sudden lashAway!-Away!-and on we dash!Torrents less rapid and less rash.
Away!- away!-My breath was goneI saw not where he hurried on:'Twas scarcely yet the break of day,
And on he foamed-away!--away!The last of human sounds which rose,
As I was darted from my foes,
Was the wild shout of savage laughter,
Which on the wind came roaring after
A moment from that rabble rout:
With sudden wrath I wrenched my head,
And snapped the cord, which to the mane
Had bound my neck in lieu of rein,
And writhing half my form about,
Howled back my curse; but'midst the tread,
The thunder of my courser's speed,
Perchance they did not hear nor heed.
Away, away, my steed and I,
Upon the pinions of the wind,
All human dwellings left behind;
We sped like meteors through the sky,
When with its crackling sound the night
Is checkered with the northern light:
Town-village--none w-ere on our track,
But a wild plain of far extent,
And bounded by a forest black;
The sky was dull, and dim, and gray,
And a low breeze crept moaning byI could have answered with a sighBut fast we fled, away, awayAnd I could neither sigh nor rray;
And my cold sweat-drops fell like rain'(pon the courser's bristling mane;
108MAZEPPA.
But, snorting still with rage and fear,
He flew upon his far career;
At times I almost thought, indeed,
He must have slackened in his speed;
But no-my bound and slender frame
Was nothing to his angry might,
And merely like a spur became:
Each motion which I made to free
Ily swoln limbs from their agony
Increased his fury and affright:
I tried my voice-'twas faint and low,
But yet he swerved as from a blow;
And, starting to each accent, sprang
As from a sudden trumpet's clang.
We near'd the wild wood-'twas so wide
I saw no bounds on either side;'Twas studded with old sturdy trees,
That bent not to the roughest breeze
Which howls down from Siberia's waste,
And strips the forest in its hasteBut these were few, and far between,
Set thick with shrubs more young and green.'Twas a wild waste of underwood,
And here an(d there a chestnut stood,
The strong oak, and the hardy pine;
But far apart-and well it were,
Or else a different lot were mineThe boughs gave way, and did not tear
My limbs; and I found strength to bear
My wounds, already scarr'd with coldMy bonds forbade to loose my hold.
We rustled through the leaves like wind,
Left shrubs, and trees, and wolves behind;:By night I heard them on the track,
Their troop came hard upon our back,
With their long gallop, which can tire
The hound's deep hate, and hunter's fire:
Where'er we flew they followed on,
Nor left us with the morning sun.
Oh! how I wished for spear or sword,
At least to die amidst the horde,
And perlish-if it must be soAt bay, destroying many a foe.
When first my courser's race begun,
I wished the goal already won.
But now I doubted strength and speed.
Vain doubt! his swift and savage breed
Had nerved him like the mountain-roe.
The wood was passed;'twas more than noon,
But chill the air, although in June;
The earth gave way, the skies rolled round,
I seemed to sink upon the ground;
109THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
But err'd, for I was fastly bound.
My heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,
And throbbed awhile, then beat no more:
The skies spun like a mighty wheel;
I saw the trees like drunkards reel,
And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,
Which saw no farther; he who dies
Can die no more than then I died,
O'ertortured by that ghastly ride.
My thoughts came back; where was I? Cold,
And numb, and giddy: pulse by pulse
Life reassumed its lingering hold,
And throb by throb: till grown a pang
Which for a moment would convulse,
My blood reflowed, though thick and chill;
My ear with uncouth noises rang,
My heart began once more to thrill;
My sight returned, though dim; alas I
And thickened, as it were, with glass.
Methought the dash of waves was nigh;
There was a gleam too of the sky,
Studded with stars; it is no dream  
The wild horse swims the wilder stream i
With glossy skin, and dripping mane,
And reeling limbs, and reeking flank,
The wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain
Up the repelling bank.
We gain the top: a boundless plain
Spreads through the shadow of the night,
And onward, onward, onward, seems,
Like precipices in our dreams,
To stretch beyond the sight.
Onward we went-but slack and slow;
His savage-force at length o'erspent,
The drooping courser, faint and low,
All feebly foaming went.
A sickly infant had had power
To guide him forward in that hour;
But useless all to me.
His new-born tameness naught availedMy limbs were bound; my force had failed,
Perchance, had they been free.
With feeble effort still I tried
To rend the bonds so starkly tiedBut still it was in vain;
My limbs were only wrung the more,
And soon the idle strife gave o'er,
Which but prolonged their pain.
Up rose the sun; the mists were curled
Back from the solitary world
110MAZEPPA.
Which lay around-behind-before;
What booted it to traverse o'er
Plain, forest, river? Man nor brute,
Nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,
Lay in the wild luxuriant soil;
No sign of travel-none of toil;
The very air was mute;
And not an insect's shrill small horn,
Nor matin bird's new voice was borne
From herb nor thicket.; Many a werst,
Panting as if his heart would burst,
The weary brute still staggered on;
And still we were--or seemed-alone!
At length, while reeling on our way,
Methought I heard a courser neigh,
Fromn out yon tuft of blackening firs.
Is it the wind those branches stirs?
No, no! from out the forest prance
A trampling troop; I see them come!
In one vast squadron they advance!
I strove to cry-my lips were dumb.
The steeds rush on in plunging pride;
But where are they the reins to guide?
A thousand horse-and none to ride!
With flowing tail, and flying mnane,
Wide nostrils-never stretched by pain,
Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,
And feet that iron never shod,
And flanks unscarred by spur or rod,
A thousand horse, the wild, the free,
Like waves that follow o'er the sea,
Came thickly thundering on,
As if our faint approach to meet;
The sight renerved my courser's feet,
A moment staggering, feebly fleet,
A moment, with a faint low neigh,
He answered, and then fell;
With gasps and glazing eyes he lay,
And reeking limbs immovable,
His first and last career is done!
On came the troop-they saw him stoop,
They saw me strangely bound along
His back with many a bloody thong:
They stop-they start-they snuff the air,
Gallop a moment here and there,
Approach, retire, wheel round and round;
Then plunging back with sudden bound,
Headed by one black mighty steed,
Who seemed the patriarch of his breed,
They snort-they foam-neigh-swerve aside,
And backward to the forest fly,
By instinct, from a human eye.
They left me there to my despair,
111THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Linked to the dead and stiffening wretch,
Whose lifeless limbs beneath me stretch,
Relieved from that unwonted weight,
From whence I could not extricate
Nor him nor me-and there we lay
The dying on the (lead!
The sun was sinking-still I lay
Chained to the chill and sti-ffening steed,
I thought to mingle there our clay;
And my dim eyes of death hath need,
No hope arose of being freed:
I cast my last looks up the sky,
And there between me and the sun
I saw the expecting raven fly,
Who scarce would wait till both should die,
Ere his repast begun;
He flew, and perched, then flew once more,
And each time nearer than before;
I saw his wing through twilight flit,
And once so near me he alit
I could have smote, but lacked the strength;
But the slight motion of my hand,
And feeble scratching of the sand,
The exerted throat's faint struggling noise,
Which scarcely could be called a voice,
Together scared him off at length.
I know no more-my latest dream
Is something of a lovely star
Which fixed my dull eyes from afar,
And went and came with wandering beam,
And of the cold, dull, swimming, dense
Sensation of recurring sense,
And then subsiding back to death,
And then again a little breath,
A little thrill, a short suspense,
An icy sickness curdling o'er
My heart, and sparks that crossed my brainA gasp, a throb, a start of pain,
A sigh, and nothing more.
The Guardian Angel.-LAMARlINE.
WHEN, in my childhood's morning, I rested'neath the shade
Of the citron or the almond tree, with fruits and blossoms weighed,
While the loose curls from my forehead were lifted by the breeze,
Which like a spirit haunteth each living thing it sees;
112SEVENTH PLAGUE OF EGYPT.
Then in those golden hours, a whisper soft and light
Stole on my senses, thrilling each pulse to wild delight;'Twas not the perfumed zephyr, the dreamy pipe's low. swell,
The tones of cherished kindred, or the distant village bell;
Oh, no, my Guardian Angel, that music in the air
Was but thy viewless pinions, that hovered round me there i
When deeper founts of feeling witlhin my bosom sprung,
And love, with soft enchantment, its varied cadence rung;
When twilight after twilight still found me lingering near
Yon green and wavy sycamore, to meet with one most dear,
Whose least caress could liberate the full springs of my breast,
Whose kiss at every parting gave strange but sweet unrest;
Ah! then the self-same whisper upon my spirit fell:
Say, could it be his footsteps, which woke the mystic spell  
Oh, no, my Guardian Angel, who watchest over me,
My heart returned that echo of sympathy from thee!
And when, in bliss maternal, I clustered round my hearth
Those blessings God had lent me, to make my heaven on earth;
When at my vine-clad portal I watched their buoyant glee,
As my children, wild with frolick, shook the ripe figs from the tree;
E'en then, though half-defined, that voice with sweetness fraught
Poured out its notes familiar upon my raptlred thought:
What moved me then? ah! was it the bird's song unrepressed?
Or the breathings of the baby that slumbered on my breast?
Oh, no, my Guardian Angel, I felt that thou wert near,
To echo back the gladness of my heart-music clear!
And now old age hath planted its snow-crown on my head,
And, sheltered from the. bleak winds that through the forest spread,
I feed the blazing embers that warm my shrinking frame,
And guard the lambs and children, who scarce can lisp my name:
Yet in this withered bosom, as in the days of youth,
The self-same voice consoles me with words of love and truth:'Tis not the joys of childhood that haunt me in my sleep,
Or the lost tones of the dear one whom even now I weep;
Oh, no, my Guardian Angel, my tried and faithful friend,
It is thy heart that tw'ineth with mine till life shall end!
Seventh Plague of Egypt.-ANo       NYMous.'TwAS morn-the rising splendor roll'd
On marble towers and roofs of gold;
Hall, court, and gallery below,
Were crowded withl a living flow;
Egyptian, Arab, Nubian there,
The bearers of the bow and spear;
113THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIS'T.
The hoary priest, tile Chaldee sage,
The slave, the gemm'd and glittering pageHelm, turban and tiara, shone
A dazzling ring round Pharaoh's throne.
There came a man-the human tide
Shrank backward from his stately stride:
HIis cheek with storm and time was tanned;
A shepherd's staff was in his hand;
A shudder of instinctive fear
Told the dark king what step was near;
On through the host the stranger came,
It parted round his form like flame.
He stoop'd not at the footstool stone,
He clasp'd not sandal, kissed not throne;
Erect he stood amid the ring,
His only words-" Be just, 0 king 1"
On Pharaoh's cheek the blood flush'd high,
A fire was in his sullen eye;
Yet on the Chief of Israel
No arrow of his thlousands fell:
All mute and moveless as the grave
Stood chill'd the satrap and the slave.
"Tl'hou'rt come," at length the monarch spoke
Haughty and high the words outbroke:
" Is Israel weary of its lair,
The forehead peel'd, the shoulder bare?
Take back the answer to your band;
Go, reap the wind; go, plough the sand;
Go, vilest of the living vile,
To build the never-ending pile,
Till, darkest of the nameless dead,
The vulture on their flesh is fed.
What better asks the howling slave
Than the base life our bounty gave?"
Shouted in pride the turban'd peers,
Upclashed to heaven the golden spears.
" King i thou and thine are doom'd!--Behold I"
The prophet spoke-the thunder roll'd!
Along the pathway of the sun
Sail'd vapory mountains, wild and dun.
" Yet there is time," the prophet saidHe raised his staff-the storm was stay'd:
"King! be the word of freedom given:
What art thou, man, to war with Heaven?"
There came no word. -The thunder broke.
Like a huge city's final smoke,
Thick, lurid, stifling, mix'd with flame,
Through court and hlall the vapors came.
Loose as the stubble in the field,
Wide flew thle men of spear and shield;
114SEVENTH PLAGUE OF EGYPT.
Scattered like foam along the wave,
Flew the proud pageant, prince and slave:
Or, in the chains of terror bound,
Lay, corpse-like, on the smouldering ground.
" Speak, king!-the wrath is but begunStill dumb?-then, Heaven, thy will be done I"
Echoed from earth a hollow roar,
Like ocean on the'midnight shore;
A sheet of lightning o'er them wheeled,
The solid ground beneath them reeled;
In dust sank roof and battlement;
Like webs the giant walls were rent;
Red, broad, before his startled gaze,
The monarch saw his Egypt blaze.
Still swelled the plague-the flame grew pale;
Burst from the clouds the charge of hail;
With arrowy keenness, iron weight;
Down poured the ministers of fate;
Till man and cattle, crushed, congealed,
Covered with death the boundless field.
Still swelled the plague-uprose the blast,
The avenger, fit to be the last;
On ocean, river, forest, vale,
Thundered at once the mighty gale.
Before the whirlwind flew the tree,
Beneath the whirlwind roared the sca;
A thousand ships were on the waveWhere are they?-ask that foaming grave
Down go the hope, the pride of years,
Down go the myriad mariners;
The riches of Earth's richest zone,
Gone! like a flash of lightning, gone I
And, lo! that first fierce triumph o'er,
Swells Ocean on the shrinking shore;
Still onward, onward, dark and wide,
Engulfs the land the furious tide.
Then bowed thy spirit, stubborn king,
Thou serpent, reft of fang and sting;
Humbled before the prophet's knee,
He groaned, " Be injured Israel free."
To heaven the sage upraised his wand;
Back rolled the deluge from the land;
Back to its caverns sank the gale;
Fled from the noon the vapors pale;
Broad burned again the joyous sun:
The hour of wrath and death was done.
115THE PRACCTICAL ELOCUTIONIST
The Minstrel Girl.-wHITTIER.
HEPR lover died. Away from her
The ocean-girls his requiem sang,
And smoothed his dreamless sepulchre
Where the tall coral branches sprang.
And it was told her how he strove
With death; but not from selfish fear:
It was the memory of her love
Which made existence doubly dear.
They told her how his fevered sleep
Revealed the phantom of his brainHe thought his love had come to keep
Her vigils at his couch of pain;
And he would speak in his soft tone,
And stretch his arms to clasp the air,
And then awaken with'a moan,
And weep that there was nothing there!
And when he bowed himself at last
Beneath the spoiler's cold eclipse,
Even as the weary spirit passed,
Iher name was on his marble lips.
She heard the tale; she did not weep;
It was too strangely sad for tears;
And so she kept it for the deep
Rememberings of after years.
She poured one lone and plaintive wail
For the loved dead-it was her lastLike harp-tones dying, on the gale
Her minstrelsy of spirit passed:
And she became an altered one,
Forgetful of her olden shrine,
As if her darkened soul had done
With all beneath the fair sunshine.
National Self-Respect.-BEMAN.
FAR be it from me to cherish, in any shape, a spirit of national
prejudice, or to excite in others a disgusting national vanity.
But when I reflect upon the part which this country is proba-.
bly to act in the renovation of the world, I rejoice that I am a
citizen of this great republic. This western continent has, at
different periods, been the subject of every species of transatlantic abuse. In former days, some of the naturalists of Europe
told us, that everything here was constructed upon a small
116THE WAR OF 1812.
scale. The frowns of nature were represented as investing the
whole hemisphere we inhabit. It has been asserted, that the
eternal storms, which are said to beat upon the brows of our
mountains, and to roll the tide of desolation at their bases-the
hurricanes which sweep our vales, and the volcanic fires which
issue from a thousand flaming craters-the thunder-bolts which
perpetually descend from heaven, and the earthquakes, whose
trepidations are felt to the very centre of our globe, have superinduced a degeneracy through all the productions of nature.
Men have been frightened into intellectual dwarfs, and the
beasts of the forest have not attained more than half their
ordinary growth! While some of the lines and touches of this
picture have been blotted out by the reversing hand of time,
others have been added, which have, in some respects, carried
the conceit still farther. In later days, and in some instances
even down to the present period, it has been published and
republished from the enlightened presses of the Old World, that
so strong is the tendency to deterioration on this continent, that the
descendants of European ancestors are far inferior to the original
stock from which thev sprang.  But inferior in what?  In
national spirit and patriotic achievement? Let the revolutionary conflict-the opening scenes at Boston, and the catastrophe
at Yorktown-furnish the reply. Let Bennington and Saratoga
support their respective claims. Inferior in enterprise? Let
the sail that whitens every ocean, and the commercial spirit that
braves every element, and visits every bustling mart, refute the
unfounded aspersion. Inferior in deeds of zeal and valor for the
church? Let our missionaries in the bosom of our own forest,
in the distant regions of the East, and on the islands of the great
Pacific, answer the question. Inferior in science, and letters,
and the arts? It is true our nation is young; but we may
challenge the world to furnish a national maturity which, in
these respects, will compare with ours.

necessary; and that, if they have any force, it is calculated to
produce unqualified submission to every species of insult and
injury. I do not feel myself bound to answer arguments of the
above description; and if I should touch on them, it will be
only incidentally, and not for the purpose of serious refutation.
The first argument of the gentleman which I shall notice, is the
unprepared state of the country.  Whatever weight this argument might have, in a question of immediate war, it surely has
little in that of preparation for it. If our country is unprepared,
let us remedy the evil as soon as possible. Let the gentleman
submit his plan; and if a reasonable one, I doubt not it will be
supported by the house. But, sir, let us admit the fact and
the whole force of the argument; I ask whose is the fault?
Who has been a member for many years past, and has seen the
defenseless state of his country even near home, under his own
eyes, without a single endeavor to remedy so serious an evil?
Let him not say, "I have acted in a minority." It is no less
the duty of the minority than a majority to endeavor to serve
our country. For that purpose we are sent here, and not for
that of opposition. Wle are next told of the expenses of the
war, and that the people will not pay taxes. Why not? Is it a
want of capacity?  What! with one million tons of shipping; a
trade of nearly one hundred million dollars; manufactures of one
hundred and fifty million dollars; and agriculture of thrice that
amount, shall we be told the country wants the capacity to raise
and support ten thousand or fifteen thousand additional regulars?
No; it has the ability-that is admitted; but will it not have
the disposition?  Is not the course a just and necessary one?
Shall we then utter this libel on the nation? Where will proof
be found of a fact so disgraceful? It is said, in the history of
the country twelve or fifteen years ago.  The case is not
parallel.  The ability of the country has greatly increased
since. The object of that tax was unpopular. But on this, as
well as my memory and almost infant observation at that time
serve me, the objection was not to the tax, or its amount, but
the mode of collection. The eye of the nation was frightened
by the number of officers; its love of liberty shocked with the
multiplicity of regulations.  We, in the vile spirit of imitation,
copied from the most oppressive part of European laws on that

duty to pay. But it may be, and I believe was said, that the
nation will not pay taxes, because the rights violated are not
worth defending; or that the defense will cost more than the
profit.
Sir, I here enter my solemn protest against this low and
"calculating avarice" entering this hall of legislation.  It is
only fit for shops and counting-houses, and ought not to disgrace the seat of sovereignty by its squalid and vile appearance. Whenever it touches sovereign power, the nation is
ruined. It is too short-sighted to defend itself. It is an unpromising spirit, always ready to yield a part to save the
balance.  It is too timid to have in itself the laws of selfpreservation. It is never safe but under the shield of honor.
Sir, I only know of one principle to make a nation great, to
produce in this country not the form but real spirit of union,
and that is, to protect every citizen in the lawful pursuit of his
business. He will then feel that he is backed by the government-that its arm is his arms, and will rejoice in its increased
strength and prosperity. Protection and patriotism are reciprocal. This is the road that all great nations have trod. Sir, I
am not versed in this calculating policy, and will not, therefore, pretend to estimate in dollars and cents the value of
national independence or national affection.  I cannot dare to
measure in shillings and pence the misery, the stripes, and the
slavery of our impressed seamen; nor even to value our shipping, commercial, and agricultural losses under the orders in
council and the British system of blockade.  I hope I have not
condemned any prudent estimate of the means of a country,
before it enters on a war.  This is wisdom, the other folly.
Death of Marmion.-scoTT.
WITH that, straight up the hill there rode
Two horsemen drenched with gore,
And in their arms, a helpless load,
A wollnded knight they bore.
His hand still strained.he broken brand;
His arms were smeared with blood and sand;
Dragged froni among the horses' feet,
With dinted shield, and helmet beat,
The falcon-crest and plumage gone,
Can that be haughty Marmion?....
L- 9THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
When, doffed his casque, he felt free air,
Around'gan Marmion wildly stare:
"Where's Harry Blount? Fitz-Eustace where
Linger ye here, ye hearts of hare!
Redeem my pennon-charge again!
Cry-' Marmion to the rescue!'-Vain!
Last of my race, on battle-plain
That shout shall ne'er be heard again!Yet my last thought is England's-fly I
Must I bid twice?-hence, varlets! fly I
Leave Marmion here alone-to die."
They parted, and alone he lay;
Clara drew her from the sight away,
Till pain rung forth a lowly moan,
And half he murmured--" Is there none,
Of all my halls have nurst,
Page, squire or groom, one cup to bring,
Of blessed water from the spring,
To slake my dying thirst?"
O, woman! in our hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,
And variable as the shade
By the light quivering aspen made;
When pain and anguish wring the brow,
A ministering angel thou!Scarce were the piteous accents said,
When, with the Baron's casque, the maid
To the nigh streamlet ran:
Forgot were hatred, wrongs, and fearsThe plaintive voice alone she hears,
Sees but the dying man.
She stooped her by the runnel's side,
But in abhorrence backward drew;
For, oozing from the mountain's side,
Where raged the war, a dark-red tide
Was curdling in the streamlet blue.
Where shall she turn?-behold her mark
A little fountain cell,
Where water, clear as diamond-spark,
In a stone basin fell.
Above, some half-worn letters say,
DRINK, WEARY PILGRIM, DRINK, AND PRAY
FOa THE KIND SOUL OF SYBIL GRAY,
WHO BUILT THIS CROSS AND WELL.
She filled the helm, and back she hied,
And with surprise and joy espied
A monk supporting Marmion's headA pious man, whom duty brought
To dubious verlge of battle fought,
To shrive the dying, bless the dead.
With fruitless labor, Clara bound,
And strove to stanch the gushing wound'
1:20QUEEN MAB.
The Monk, with unavailing cares,
Exhausted all the Church's prayers.
Ever, he said, that, close and near,
A lady's voice was in his ear,
And that the priest he could not hear;
For that she ever sung,
"In the lost battle, borne down by the flying,
Where mingles war's rattle with groans of the dying 1"
So the notes rung;--
"Avoid thee, Fiend!-with cruel hand,
Shake not the dying sinner's sand!O look, my son, upon yon sign
Of the Redeemer's grace divine;
O think on faith and bliss!By many a death-bed I have been,
And many a sinner's parting seen,
But never aught like this."
The war, that for a space did fail,
Now trebly thundering swelled the gale,
And-STANLEY I was the cry;A light on Marmion's visage spread,
And fired his glazing eye:
With dying hand, above his head,
He shook the fragment of his blade,
And shouted " Victory!Charge, Chester, charge I On, Stanley, on I"
Were the last words of Marmion.
Queen Mab.-SHAKSPEARE.
O, THEN, I see, queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife; and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep:
Her wagon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams:
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash of film:
Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid:
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
Made by the joiner squirrel, or old grub,
Time out of mind the fairies' coach-makers.
And in this state she gallops night by night

121THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love:
On courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees:
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream;
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit:
And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
Tickling a parson's nose as'a lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear; at which he st.arts, and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again.
Character of Byron.-MACAULAY.
NEVER had any writer so vast a command of the whole eloquence of scorn, misanthropy, and despair. That Marah was
never dry.  No art could sweeten, no draughts could exhaust,
its perennial waters of bitterness. Never was there such variety
in monotony as that of Byron. From maniac laughter to piercing lamentation, there was not a single note of human anguish
of which he was not master.   Year after year, and month after
month, he continued to repeat that to be wretched is the destiny of all; that to be eminently wretched is the destiny of the
eminent; that all the desires by which we are cursed lead alike
to misery;-if they are not gratified, to the misery of disappointment; if they are gratified, to the misery of satiety. His principal heroes are men who have arrived by different roads at the
same goal of despair, who are sick of life, who are at war with
society, who are supported in their anguish only by an unconquerable pride, resembling that of Prometheus on the rock, or
of Satan in the burning marl; who can master their agonies by
the force of their will, and who, to the last, defy the whole
power of earth and heaven. He always described himself as a
man of the same kind with his favorite creations, as a man
whose heart had been withered, whose capacity for happiness
was gone, and could not be restored; but whose invincible spirit
dared the worst that could befall him here or hereafter.
122CHARACTER OF BYRON.                    123
How much of this morbid feeling sprung from an original discase of mind, how much from real misfortune, how much from
the nervousness of dissipation, how much of it was fanciful, how
much of it was merely affected, it is impossible for us, and
would probably have been impossible for the most intimate
friends of Lord Byron, to decide. Whlether there ever existed,
or can ever exist, a person answering to the description which
he gave of himself, may be doubted: but that he was not such
a person is beyond all doubt. It is ridiculous to imagine that a
man whose mind was really imbued with scorn of his fellowcreatures, would have published three or four books every year
in order to tell them so; or that a man, who could say with
truth that he neither sought sympathy nor needed it, would
have admitted all Europe to hear his farewell to his wife, and
his blessings on his child. In the second canto of Childe Harold, he tells us that he is insensible to fame and obloquy:
"Ill may such contest now the spirit move,
Which heeds nor keen reproof nor partial praise."
Yet we know, on the best evidence, that a day or two before he
published these lines, he was greatly, indeed childishly, elated
by the compliments paid to his maiden speech in the House of
Lords.
We are far, however, from thinking that his sadness was altogether feigned. He was naturally a man of great sensibility; he
had been ill-educated; his feelings had been early exposed to
sharp trials; he had been crossed in his boyish love; he had
been mortified by the failure of his first literary efforts; he
was straitened in pecuniary circumstances; he was unfortunate in his domestic relations; the public treated him with
cruel injustice; his health and spirits suffered from his dissipated habits of life; he was, on the whole, an unhappy man.
He early discovered that, by parading his unhappiness before
the multitude, he excited an unrivalled interest. The world
gave him every encouragement to talk about his mental sufferings. The effect which his first confessions produced, induced
him to affect much that he did not feel; and the affectation
probably reacted on his feelings. How far the character in
which he exhibited himself was genuine, and how far theatrical,
would probably have puzzled himself to say.
There can be no doubt that this remarkable man owed the
vast influence which he exercised over his contemporaries, at
least as much to his gloomy egotism as ta the real power of hisTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
poetry. We never could very clearly understand how it is that
egotism, so unpopular in conversation, should be so popular in
writing; or how it is that men who affect in their compositions
qualities and feelings which they have not, impose so much
more easily on their contemporaries than on posterity. The
interest which the loves of Petrarch excited in his own time,
and the pitying fondness with which half Europe looked upon
Rousseau, are well known. To readers of our time, the love of
Petrarch seems to have been love of that kind which breaks no
hearts; and the sufferings of Rousseau to have deserved laughter rather than pity-to have been partly counterfeited, and
partly the consequences of his own perverseness and vanity.
What our grandchildren may think of the character of Lord
Byron, as exhibited in his poetry, we will not pretend to guess.
It is certain, that the interest which he excited during his life is
without a parallel in literary history. The feeling with which
young readers of poetry regarded him, can be conceived only by
those who have experienced it. To people who are unacquainted with the real calamity, " nothing is so dainty sweet as
lov*ly melancholy."  This faint image of sorrow has in all ages
been considered by young gentlemen as an agreeable excitement. Old gentlemen and middle-aged gentlemen have so
many real causes of sadness, that they are rarely inclined "to
be as sad as night only for wantonness." Indeed they want the
power i almost as much as the inclination. We know very few
persons engaged in active life, who, even if they were to procure
stools to be melancholy upon, and were to sit down with all the
premeditation of Master Stephen, would be able to enjoy much
of what somebody calls the " ecstasy of woe."
Among that large class of young persons whose reading is
almost entirely confined to works of imagination, the popularity
of Lord Byron was unbounded. They bought pictures of him,
they treasured up the smallest relics of him; they learned his
poems by heart, and did their best to write like him, and to look
like him. Many of them practised at the glass, in the hope of
catching the curl of the upper lip, and the scowl of the brow,
which appear in some of his portraits. A few discarded their
neckcloths in imitation of their great leader. For some years,
the Minerva press sent forth no novel without a mysterious, unhappy, Lara-like peer. The number of hopeful undergraduates
and medical students who became things of dark imaginings, on
whom the freshness of the heart ceased to fall like dew, whose
passions had consumed themselves to dust, and to whom the
124THE DYING GLADIATOR.
relief of tears was denied, passes all calculation. This was not
the worst. There was created in the minds of many of these
enthusiasts, a pernicious and absurd association between intellectual power and moral depravity.  From the poetry of Lord
Byron they drew a system of ethics, compounded of misanthropy and voluptuousness.
This affectation has passed away; and a few more years will
destroy whatever yet remains of that magical potency which
once belonged to the name of Byron. To us he is still a man,
young, noble, and unhappy. To our children he will be merely
a writer; and their impartial judgment will appoint his place
among writers, without regard to his rank or to his private history. That his poetry will undergo a severe sifting; that much
of what has been admired by his contemporaries will be rejected
as worthless, we have little doubt. But welhave as little doubt,
that, after the closest scrutiny, there will still remain much that
can only perish with the English language.
The Dying Gladiator._BYRoN.
I SEr before me the Gladiator lie:
He leans upon his hand-his manly brow
Consents to death, but conquers agony,
An/d his drooped head sinks gradually lowAnd through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,
Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now
The arena swims around him-he is gone,
Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.
He heard it, but he heeded not-his eyes'Were with his heart, and that was far away;
He reck'd not of the life he lost nor prize,
But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,
There were his young barbarians all at play,
There was their Dacian mother-he, their sire,
Butchered to make a Roman holidayAll this rushed with his blood-Shall he expire
And unavenged --Arije! ye Goths, and glut your ire t

Mont Blanc from     the Col de Balme.-G. B. CHEEVER.
THE Col de Balme is about seven thousand feet high, and
lying as it does across the vale of Chamouny at the end toward:Martigny and the valley of the Rhone, through which runs the
grand route of the Simplon from Switzerland to Italy, you have
from it one of the most perfect of all views both of Mont Blanc
and the vale of Chamouny, with all the other mountain ridges
on every side.  You have, as it were, an observatory erected
for you, seven thousand feet high, to look at a mountain of
sixteen thousand feet.....
Till we arrived within a quarter of an hour of the summit,
the atmosphere was clear, and Mont Blanc rose to the view
with a sublimity wlhch it seemed at every step could scarcely
be rivalled, and which yet at every step was increasing. The
path is a winding ascent, practicable only for mules or on foot.
A northeast wind, in this last quarter of an hour, was driving
the immensity of mist from the other side of the mountain over
the summit, enveloping all creation in a thick frosty fog, so that
when we got to the solitary house, we were surrounded by an
ocean of cold gray cloud, that left neither mountain nor the sun
itself distinguishable. And such, thought we, is the end of all
our morning's starvation, perils, and labors; not to see an inch
before us; all this mighty prospect, for which alone one might
worthily cross the Atlantic, hidden from us, and quite shut
out! We could have wept, perhaps, if we had not been too
cold and too hungry. Our host burned up the remainder of
his year's supply of wood to get us a fire, and then most hospitably provided us with a breakfast of roast potatoes, whereby
all immediate danger of famishing was deferred to a considerable
distance. But our bitter disappointment in the fog was hard to
be borne, and we sat brooding and mourning over the gloomy
prospect for the day, and wondering what we had best do with
ourselves, when suddenly, on turning toward the window, Mont
Blank was flashing in the sunshine.
Such an instantaneous and extraordinary revelation of splendor we never dreamed of.  The clouds had vanished, we could
not tell where, and the whole illimitable vast of glory in this,
the heart of Switzerland's Alpine grande:irs, was disclosed;
the snowy Monarch of Mountains, the huge glaciers, the jagged
granite peaks, needles, and rough enormous crags and ridges
congregated and shooting up in every direction, with the long,
beautiful vale of Chamouny visible from end to end, far beneath
126MONT BLANC FROM THE COL DE BALME.
as still and shining as a picture! Just over the longitudinal
ridge of mountains on one side was -the moon in an infinite
depth of ether; it seemed as if we could touch it; and on the
other the sun was exulting as a bridegroom coming out of his
chamber. The clouds still sweeping past us, now concealing,
now partially veiling, and now revealing the view, added to its
power by such sudden alternations.
Far down the vale floated in mid air beneath us a few fleeces
of cloud, below and beyond which lay the valley with its villages, meadows, and winding paths, and the river running
through it like a silver thread. Shortly the mists congregated
away beyond this scene, rolling masses upon masses, penetrated
and turned into fleecy silver by the sunlight, the whole body of
them gradually retreating over the southwestern end and barrier of the valley.  In our position we now s-aw the different
gorges in the chain of Mont Blanc lengthwise, Charmontiere,
Du Bois, and the Glacier du Bosson protruding its whole enorme
from the valley. The Grand Mulet, with the vast snow-depths
and crevasses of Mont Blanc were revealed to us. That sublime
summit was now for the first time seen in its solitary superiority,
at first appearing round and smooth, white and glittering with
perpetual snow; but as the sun in his higher path cast shadows
from summit to summit, and revealed ledges and chasms, we
could see the smoothness broken. Mont Blanc is on the right
of the valley, looking up from the Col de Balme; the left range
being much lower, though the summit of the Buet is nearly ten
thousand feet in height. Now on the Col de Balme we are
midway in these sublime views, on an elevation of seven thousand feet, without an intervening barrier of any kind to interrupt
our sight.
On the Col itself we are between two loftier heights, both of
which I ascended, one of them being a ridge so sharp and steep,
that though I got up without much danger, yet on turning to
look about me and come down, it was absolutely frightful. A
step either side would have sent me sheer down a thousand
feet; and the crags by which I had mounted appeared so
loosely perched, as if I could shake and tumble them from
their places by my hand. The view in every direction seemed
infinitely extended, chain behind chain, ridge after ridge, in
almost endless succession.
But the hour of most intense splendor in this day of glory
was the rising of the clouds in Chamouny, as we could discern
them like st,ripes of amber floating in an azure sea. They
rested upon and floated over the successive glacier gorges of

the mountain range on either hand, like so many:islands of
the blest, anchored in mid-heaven below us; or lile so many
radiant files of the white-robed heavenly host floating transversely across the valley. Th1is extended through its whole
length, and it was a most singular phenomenon; for through
these ridges of cloud we could look as through a telescope
down into the vale and.along to its farther end; but the intensity of the light flashing from the snows of the mountains
and reflected in these fleecy radiances, almost as so many
secondary suns, hung in the clear atmosphere, was well-nigh
blinding.
The scene seemed to me a fit symbol of celestial glories;
and I thought if a vision of such intense splendor could be
arrayed by the divine power out of mere earth, air, and water,
and made to assume such beauty indescribable at a breath of
the wind, a movement of the sun, a slight change in the elements, what mind could even dimly and distantly form to itself
a conception of the splendors of the world of heavenly glory!
The Hurricane.-   AUDUBON.
VARIovs portions of our country have at different periods
suffered severely from the influence of violent storms of wind,
some of which have been known to traverse nearly the whole
extent of the United States, and to leave such deep impressions
in their wake as will not easily be forgotten. Having witnessed
one of these awful phenomena, in all its grandeur, I will attempt
to describe it. The recollection of that astonishing revol0ution
of the ethereal element even now brings with it so disagreeable
a sensation, that I feel as if about to be affected by a sudden
stoppage of the circulation of my blood.'I had left the village of Shawaney, situated on the banks of
the Ohio, on my return from Henderson, which is also situated
on the banks of the same beautiful stream. The weather- was
pleasant, and I thought not warmer than usual at that season.
My horse was jogging quietly along, and my thoughts were,
for once at least in the course of my life, entirely engaged in
commercial speculations. I had forded Highland Creek, and
was on the eve of entering X tract of bottom land or valley
that lay between it an'. Canoe Creek, when on a sudden I re128THE HURRICANE.
marked a great difference in the aspect of the heavens. A hazy
thickness had overspread the country, and I for some time expected an earthquake, but my horse exhibited no propensity to
stop and prepare for such an occurrence. I had nearly arrived
at the verge of the valley, when I thought fit to stop near a
brook, and dismounted to quench the thirst which had come
upon me.
I was leaning on my knees, with my lips about to touch the
water, when, from my proximity to the earth, I heard a distant
murmuring sound of an extraordinary nature. I drank, however, and as I rose on my feet, looked toward the southwest,
where I observed a yellowish, oval spot, the appearance of
which was quite new to me. Little time was left to me for
consideration, as the next moment a smart breeze began to agitate the taller trees. It increased to an unexpected height, and
already the smaller branches and twigs were seen falling in a
slanting direction towards the ground.  Two minutes had
scarcely elapsed, when the whole forest before me was in fearful motion. Here and there, where one tree pressed against
another, a creaking noise was produced, similar to that occasioned by the violent gusts which sometimes sweep over the
country.  Turning instinctively towards the direction from
which the wind blew, I saw, to my great astonishment, that the
noblest trees of the forest bent their lofty heads for a while, and
unable to stand against the blast, were falling into pieces.
First, the branches were broken off with a crackling noise; then
went the upper part of the massy trunks; and in many places
whole trees of gigantic size were falling entire to the ground.
So rapid was the progress of the storm, that before I could
think of taking measures to insure my safety, the hurricane was
passing opposite the place where I stood. Never can I forget
the scene which at that moment presented itself. The tops of
the trees were seen moving in the strangest manner, in the central current of the tempest, which carried along with it a mingled mass of twigs and foliage, that completely obscured the
view. Some of the largest trees were seen bending and writhing under the gale; others suddenly snapped across; and many,
after a momentary resistance, fell uprooted to the earth. The
mass of branches, twigs, foliage, and dust that moved through
the air, was whirled onwards like a. cloud of feathers, and on
passing, disclosed a wide space filled with fallen trees, naked
stumps, and heaps of shapeless ruins, which marked the path
of the tempest. This space was about a fourth of a mile in
breadth, and to my imagination resembled the dried-up bed of
6*
129THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
the Mississippi, with its thousands of planters and sawyers,
strewed in the sand, and inclined in various degrees. The horrible noise resembled that of the great cataracts of Niagara, and
as it howled along in the track of the desolating tempest, produced a feeling in my mind which it is impossible to describe.
The principal force of the hurricane was now over, although
millions of twigs and small branches, that had been brought
from a great distance, were seen following the blast, as if drawn
onwards by sdme mysterious power. They even floated in the
air for some hours after, as if supported by the thick mass of
dust that rose high above the ground. The sky had nbw a
greenish lurid hue, and an extremely disagreeable sulphureous
odor was diffused in the atmosphere. I waited in amazement,
having sustained no material injury, until nature at length resumed her wonted aspect. For some moments, I felt undetermined whether I should return to Morgantown, or attempt to
force my way through the wrecks of the tempest. My business,
however, being of an urgent nature, I ventured into the path
of the storm, and after encountering innumerable difficulties,
succeeded in crossing it. I was obliged to lead my horse by
the bridle to enable him to leap over the fallen trees, whilst I
scrambled over or under them in the best way I could, at times
so hemmed in by the broken tops and tangled branches, as al-.
most to become desperate. On arriving at my house, I gave
an account of what I had seen, when, to my surprise, I was told
that there had been very little wind in the neighborhood, although in the streets and gardens many branches and twigs
had fallen in a manner which excited great surprise.
Many wondrous accounts of the devastating effect of this
hurricane were circulated in the country, after its occurrence.
Some log-houses, we were told, had been overturned, and their
inmates destroyed. One person informed me that a wire-sifter
had been conveyed by the gust to a distance of many miles.
Another had found a cow lodged in the fork of a large halfbroken tree. But, as I am disposed to relate only what I have
myself seen, I will not lead you into the region of romance, but
shall content myself by saying that much damage was done by
this awful visitation. The valley is yet a desolate place, overgrown with briars and bushes, thickly entangled amidst the tops
and trunks of the fallen trees, and is the resort of ravenous animals, to which they betake themselves when pursued by man,
or after they have committed their depredations on the farms
of the surrounding district. I have crossed the path of the

witnessed its fury, and, again, four hundred miles farther off, in
the State of Ohio. Lastly, I observed traces of its ravages on
the summits of the mountains connected with the Great Pine
Forest of Pennsylvania, three hundred miles beyond the place
last mentioned. In all these different parts, it appeared to me
not to have exceeded a quarter of a mile in breadth.
Araby's Daughter.-MooRE.
FAREwELL-farewell to thee, Araby's daughter!
(Thus warbled a Peri beneath the dark sea:)
No pearl ever lay, under Oman's green water,
More pure in its shell than thy spirit in thee.
Oh! fair as the sea-flower close to thee growing,
How light was thy heart till love's witchery came,
Like the wind of the south o'er a summer lute blowing,
And hushed all its music and withered its frame!
But long, upon Araby's green sunny highlands,
Shall maids and their lovers remember the doom
Of her, who lies sleeping among the Pearl Islands,
With naught but the sea-star to light up her tomb.
And still, when the merry date-season is burning,
And calls to the palm-groves the young and the old,
The happiest there, from their pastime returning,
At sunset, will weep when thy story is told.
The young village maid, when with flowers she dresses
Her dark flowing hair for some festival day,
Will think of thy fate till, neglecting her tresses,
She mournfully turns from the mirror away.
Nor shall Iran, beloved of her hero! forget theeThough tyrants watch over her tears as they start,
Close, close by the side of that hero she'll set thee,
Embalmed in the innermost shrine of her heart.
Farewell-be it ours to embellish thy pillow
With everything beauteous that grows in the deep;
Each flower of the rock and each gem of the billow
Shall sweeten thy bed and illumine thy sleep.
Around thee shall glisten the loveliest amber
That ever the sorrowing sea-bird has wept;
With many a shell, in whose hollow-wreathed chamber
We, Peris of Ocean, by moonlight have slept.
131THE PRA:CTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
We'll dive where the gardens of coral lie darkling,
And plant all the rosiest stems at thy head;
We'll seek where the sands of the Caspian are sparkling,
And gather their gold to strew over thy bed.
Farewell-farewell-until pity's sweet fountain
Is lost in the hearts of the fair and the brave,
They'll weep for the chieftain who died on that mountain,
They'll weep for the maiden who sleeps in this wave.
A Picture.-SHELLEY.
How beautiful this night! the balmiest sigh
Which vernal zephyrs breathe in evening's ear,
Were discord to the speaking quietude
That wraps this moveless scene. Heaven's ebon vault,
Studded with stars unutterably bright,
Through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls,
Seems like a canopy which love has spread
Above the sleeping world. Yon gentle hills,
Robed in a garment of untrodden snow;
Yon darksome rocks, whence icicles depend,
So stainless, that their white and glittering spires
Tinge not the moon's pure beam; yon castled steep,
Whose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn tower
So idly, that rapt fancy deemeth it
A metaphor of peace; all form a scene
Where musing solitude might love to lift
Her soul above this sphere of earthliness;
Where silence undisturbed might watch alone,
So cold, so bright, so still! The orb of day,
In southern climes, o'er ocean's waveless field
Sinks sweetly smiling: not the faintest breath
Steals o'er the unruffled deep; the clouds of eve
Reflect unmoved the lingering beam of day;
And vesper's image on the western main
Is beautifully still. To-morrow comes:
Cloud upon cloud, in dark and deepening mass,
Roll o'er the blackened waters; the deep roar
Of distant thunder mutters awfully;
Tempest unfolds its pinions o'er the gloom
That shrouds the boiling surge; the pitiless fiend,
With all his winds and lightnings, tracks his prey;
The torn deep yawns--the vessel finds a grave
Beneath its jagged gulf.
Ah! whence yon glare
That fires the arch of heaven?-that dark red smoke
Blotting the silver moon? The stars are quenchedTHE WHIP-POOR-WILL.
In darkness, and the pure and spangling snow
Gleams faintly through the gloom that gathers round!
Hark to that roar, whose swift and deafening peals
In countless echoes through the mountains ring,
Startling pale midnight on her starry throne i
Now swells the intermingling din; the jar,
Frequent and frightful, of the bursting bomb;
The falling beam, the shriek, the groan, the shout,
The ceaseless clangor, and the rush of men
Inebriate with rage!-Loud and more loud
The discord grows; till pale death shuts the scene,
And o'er the conqueror and the conquered draws
His cold and bloody shroud. Of all the men
Whom day's departing beam saw blooming there,
In proud and vigorous health-of all the hearts
That beat with anxious life at sunset thereHow few survive, how few are beating now!
All is deep silence, like the fearful calm
That slumbers in the storm's portentous pause;
Save when the frantic wail of widowed love
Comes shuddering on the blast, or the faint moan
With which some soul bursts from the frame of clay
Wrapt round its struggling powers.
The gray morn
Dawns on the mournful scene; the sulphurous smoke
Before the icy wind slow rolls away,
And the bright beams of frosty morning dance
Along the spangling snow. There tracks of blood,
Even to the forest's depth, and scattered arms,
And lifeless warriors, whose hard lineaments
Death's self could change not, mark the dreadful path
Of the outsallying victors: far behind
Black ashes note where their proud city stood.
Within yon forest is a gloomy glenEach tree which guards its darkness from the day
Waves o'er a warrior's tomb.
The Whip-poor-will.-G; P. MORRIs.
WHY dost thou come at set of sun
Those pensive words to say  
Why whip-poor-will?-what has he done!
And who is Will I pray?
Why come from yon leaf-shaded hill,
A suppliant at my door?
Why ask of me to whip-poor-will  
And is Will really poor  
133THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
If poverty's his crime, let mirth
From out his heart be driven;
That is the deadliest sin on earth,
And never is forgiven.
Art Will himself? It must be so,
I learn it from thy moan;
For none can feel another's woe
As deeply as his own.
Yet wherefore strain thy tiny throat
While other birds repose  
What means thy melancholy note?
The mystery disclose.
Still " Whip-poor-will, "-Art thou a sprite
From unknown regions sent,
To wander in the gloom of night

Is thine a conscience sore beset

No money in thy purse  
If this be thy hard fate indeed,
Ah well may'st thou repine!
The sympathy I give I need,
The poet's doom is thine.
Art thou a lover, Will?-hast prov'd
The fairest can deceive?
Thine is the lot of all who've lov'd,Since Adam wedded Eve.
Hast trusted in a friend, and seen
No friend was he in need?
A common error-men still lean
Upon as frail a reed.
Hast thou in seeking wealth and fame
A crown of brambles won?
O'er all the earth,'tis just the same
With etery mother's son.
Hast found the world a Babel wide
Where man to Mammon stoops;
Where flourish arrogance and pride,
VWhile modest merit droops?
What none of these? Then whence thy painl'o guess it who's the skill a
Pray have the kindness to explain
Why I should whip-poor-will!
134THE PILGRIMS.
Dost merely ask thy just desert?
What not another word?
Back to the woods again, unhurt,
I would not harm thee, bird!
But treat thee kindly-for my nerves,
Like thine, have penance done;
Treat every'man as he deserves,
Who shall'scape whipping?-NONE I
Farewell, poor Will-not valueless
This lesson by thee given;
Keep thine own counsel, and confess
Thyself alone to Heaven!
The Pilgrims.-MRs. SIGOURNEY.
How slow yon tiny vessel ploughs the main I
Amid the heavy billows now she seems
A toiling atom-then from wave to wave
Leaps madly, by the tempest lashed-or reels,
Half wrecked, through gulfs profound.
Moons wax and wane,
But still that lonely traveller treads the deep.
I see an ice-bound coast, toward which she steers
With such a tardy movement, that it seems
Stern winter's hand hath turned her keel to stone,
And sealed his victory on her slippery shrouds.
They land!--they land!-not like the Genoesc,
With glittering sword and gaudy train, and eye
Kindling with golden fancies. Forth they come
From their long prison-hardy forms, that brave
The world's unkindness--men of hoary hair,
And virgins of firm heart, and matrons grave,
Who hush the wailing infant with a glance.
Bleak Nature's desolation wraps them round,
Eternal forests, and unyielding earth,
And savage men, who through the thickets peer
With vengeful arrow. What could lure their steps
To this drear desert? Ask of him who left
His father's home to roam through Haran's wilds,
Distrusting not the Guide who called him forth,
Nor doubting, though a stranger, that his seed
Should be as Ocean's sands.
But yon lone bark
Hath spread her parting sail.
They crowd the strand,
Those few, lone pilgrims. Can ye scan the woe
135THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
That wrings their bosoms, as the last frail linK
Binding to man, and habitable earth,
Is severed? Can ye tell what pangs were there,
What keen regrets, what sickness of the heart,
What yearnings o'er their forfeit land of birth,
Their distant, dear ones?
Long, with straining eye,
They watchthe lessening speck. Heard ye no shriek
Of anguish, when that bitter loneliness
Sank down into their bosoms? No! they turn
Back to their dreary, famished huts, and pray IPray-and the ills that haunt this transient life
Fade into air. Up in each girded breast
There sprang a rooted and mysterious strength,
A loftiness-to face a world in arms--
To strip the pomp from sceptres-and to lay
Upon the sacred altar the warm blood
Of slain affections, when they rise between
The soul and God.
And can ye deem it strange
That from their planting such a branch should bloom
As nations envy? Would a germ, embalmed
With prayer's pure tear-drops, strike no deeper root
Than that which mad ambition's hand doth strew
Upon the winds, to reap the winds again?
Hid by its veil of waters from the hand
Of greedy Europe, their bold vine spread forth
In giant strength.
Its early clusters, crushed'n Englands wine-press, gave the tyrant host
A draught of deadly wine.-O, ye who boast
In your free veins the blood of sires like these,
Lose not their lineaments! Should Mammon cling
Too close around your heart, or wealth beget
That bloated luxury whieh eats the core
From manly virtue, or the tempting world
Make faint the Christian purpose in your soul,
Turn ye to Plymouth's beach-and on that rock
Kneel in their foot-prints, and renew the vow
They breathed to God.
The Settlement of Plymouth.-wWErSTER.
OUR fathers came hither to a land from    which they wer3
never to return. Hither they had brought, and here they were
to fix their hopes, their attachments, and their objects. Some
natural tears they shed, as they left the pleasant abodes
136THE SETTLEMENT OF PLYMOUTH.
of their fathers, and some emotions they suppressed when the
white cliffs of their native country, now seen for the last time,
grew dim to their sight. They were acting however upon a
resolution not to be changed. With whatever stifled regrets,
with whatever occasional hesitation, with whatever appalling
apprehensions, which must sometimes arise with force to shake
the firmest purpose, they had yet committed themselves to
heaven and the elements; and a thousand leagues of water
soon interposed to separate them for ever from the region which
gave them birth. A new existence awaited them here; and
when they saw these shores, rough, cold, barbarous, and barren as then they were, they beheld their country. That mixed
and strong feeling, which we call love of country, and which is
in general never extinguished in the heart of man, grasped and
embraced its proper object here. Whatever constitutes country,
except the earth and the sun, all the moral causes of affection
and attachment which operate upon the heart, they had brought
with them to their new abode. Here were now their families
and friends, their homes, and their property. Before they
reached the shore, they had established the elements of a social
system, and at a much earlier period had settled their forms of
religious worship. At the moment of their landing, therefore,
they possessed institutions of government, and institutions of
religion; and friends and families, and social and religious institutions, established by consent, founded on choice and preference, how nearly do these fill up our whole idea of country!
The morning that beamed on the first night of their repose saw
the Pilgrims already established in their country. There were
political institutions, and civil liberty, and religious worship.
Poetry has fancied nothing in the wanderings of heroes so distinct and characteristic. Here was man indeed unprotected,
and unprovided for, on the shore of a rude and fearful wilderness; but it was politic, intelligent, and educated man. Every
thing was civilized but the physical world. Institutions containing in substance all that ages had done for human government were established in a forest. Cultivated mind was to act
on uncultivated nature; and, more than all, a government and
a country were to commence with the very first foundations laid
under the divine light of the Christian religion. Happy auspices of a happy futurity! Who would wish that his country's
existence had otherwise begun? Who would desire the power
of going back to the ages of fable?  Who would wish for an
origin obscured in the darkness of antiquity? Who would wish

The Pilgrims of the MayfJower.-EDWARD EVEREr.
METHINKS I see it now, that one solitary, adventurous vessel,
the Mayflower of a forlorn hope, freighted with the prospects
of a future state, and bound across the unknown sea. I behold
it pursuing, with a thousand misgivings, the uncertain, the
tedious voyage. Suns rise and set, and weeks and months pass,
and winter surprises them on the deep, but brings them not the
sight of the wished-for shore. I see them now scantily supplied with provisions, crowded almost to suffocation in their
ill-stored prison, delayed by calms, pursuing a circuitous route.
and now driven in fury before the raging tempest, on the high
and giddy waves. The awful voice of the storm howls through
the rigging.  The laboring masts seem straining from  their
base; the dismal sound of the pumps is heard; the ship leaps,
as it were, madly from billow to billow; the ocean breaks, and
settles with engulfing floods over the floating deck, and beats
with deadening weight against the staggered vessel.  I see
them, escaped from these perils, pursuing their all but desperate
undertaking, and landed at last, after a five months' passage,
on the iceGlad rocks of Plymouth; weak and weary from the
voyage, poorly armed, scantily provisioned, depending on the
charity of their shipmaster for a draught of beer on board,
drinking nothing but water on shore, without shelter, without
means, surrounded by hostile tribes. Shut now the volume of
history, and tell me, on any principle of human probability,
what shall be the fate of this handful of adventurers. Tell me,
man of military science, in how many months were they all
swept off by the thirty savage tribes, enumerated within the
early limits of New England?  Tell me, politician, how lono
did this shadow of a colony, on which your conventions and
treaties had not smiled, languish on the distant coast? Student
of history, compare for me the baffled projects, the deserted
settlements, the abandoned adventures of other times, and find

the parallel of this! Was it the winter's storm, beating upon
the houseless heads of women and children; was it hard labor
and spare meals; was it disease; was it the tomahawk; was it
the deep malady of a blighted hope, a ruined enterprise, and a
broken heart, aching in its last moments at the recollection of
the loved and left, beyond the sea; was it some, or all of these
united, that hurried this forsaken company to their melancholy
fate? And is it possible that neither of these causes, that not
all combined, were able to blast this bud of hope? Is it possible that from a beginning so feeble, so frail, so worthy-not
so much of admiration as of pity-there has gone forth a progress so steady, a growth so wonderful, a reality so important,
a promise, yet to be fulfilled, so glorious?
Duties of American Citizens.-LEVI WOODBURY.
IT behooves us to look our perils and difficulties, such as they
are, in the face. Then, with the exercise of candor, calmness,
and fortitude, being able to comprehend fully their character
and extent, let us profit by the teachings of almost every page
in our annals, that any defects, under our existing system, have
resulted more from the manner of administering it, than from its
substance or form.
We less need new laws, new institutions, or new powers, than
we need, on all occasions, at all times, and in all places, the requisite intelligence concerning the true spirit of our present
ones; the high moral courage, under every hazard, and against
every offender, to execute with fidelity the authority already
possessed; and the manly independence to abandon all supineness, irresolution, vacillation, and time-serving pusillanimity,
and enforce our present mild system with that uniformity and
steady vigor throughout, which alone can supply the place of
the greater severity of less free institutions.
To arm and encourage us in renewed efforts to accomplish
everything on this subject which is desirable, our history constantly points her finger to a most efficient resource, and indeed
to the only elixir, to secure a long life to any popular government, in increased attention to useful education and sound
morals, with the wise description of equal measures and just
139THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
practices they inculcate on every leaf of recorded time. Before
their alliance, the spirit of misrule will always, in time, stand
rebuked, and those who worship at the shrine of unhallowed
ambition, must quail.
Storms, in the political atmosphere, may occasionally happen
by the encroachments of usurpers, the corruption or intrigues
of demagogues, or in the expiring agonies of faction, or by the
sudden fury of popular frenzy; but, with the restraints and
salutary influences of the allies before described, these storms
will purify as healthfully as they often do in the physical world,
and cause the tree of liberty, instead of falling, to strike its roots
deeper. In this struggle, the enlightened and moral possess
also a power, auxiliary and strong, in the spirit of the age,
which is not only with them, but onward, in everything to
ameliorate or improve.
When the struggle assumes the form of a contest with power,
in all its subtlety, or with undermining and corrupting wealth,
as it sometimes may, rather than with turbulence, sedition, or
open aggression by the needy and desperate, it will be indispensable to employ still greater diligence; to cherish earnestness
of purpose, resoluteness in conduct; to apply hard and constant
blows to real abuses, rather than milk-and-water remedies, and
encourage not only bold, free, and original thinking, but determined action.
In such a cause, our fathers were men whose hearts were not
accustomed to fail them, through fear, however formidable the
obstacles.  We are not, it is trusted, such degenerate descendants, as to prove recreant, and fail to defend, with gallantry and
firmness as unflinching, all which we have either derived from
them, or since added to the rich inheritance.
At such a crisis; therefore, and in such a cause, yielding to
neither consternation nor despair, may we not all profit by the
vehement exhortations of Cicero to Atticus: "If you are asleep,
awake; if you are standing, move; if you are moving, run; if
you are running, fly?"
All these considerations warn us-the grave-stones of almost
every former republic warn us-that a high standard of moral
rectitude, as well as of intelligence, is quite as indispensable to
communities, in their public doings, as to individuals, if they
would escape from either degeneracy or disgrace.
140THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.
The Dream      of Eugene Aram.-T. HooD.*'TwAs in the prime of summer time,
An evening calm and cool,
And four-and-twenty happy boys
Came bounding out of school:
There were some that ran and some that leapt,
Like troutlets in a pool.
Away they sped with gamesome minds,
And souls untouched by sin;
To a level mead they came, and there
They drave the wickets in:
Pleasantly shone the setting sun
Over the town of Lynn.
Like sportive deer they coursed about,
And shouted as they ran,
Turning to mirth all things of earth,
As only boyhood can;
But the usher sat remote from all,
A melancholy man!
His hat was off, his vest was apart,
To catch heaven's blessed breeze;
For a burning thought was in his brow,
And his bosom ill at ease;
So he leaned his head on his hands, and read
The book'between his knees!
Leaf after leaf he turned it o'er,
Nor ever glanced aside;
For the peace of his soul he read that book
In the golden eventide:
Much study had made him very lean,
And pale, and leaden-eyed.
At last he shut the ponderous tome;
With a fast and fervent grasp
He strain'd the dusky covers close,
And fix'd the brazen hasp:
"O God, could I so close my mind,
And clasp it with a clasp!"
Then leaping on his feet upright,
Some moody turns he tookT* he late Admiral Burney went to school at an establishment where
the unhappy Eugene Aram was usher, subsequent to his crime. The
admiral stated, that Aram was generally liked by the boys; and that
he used to discourse to them about murder, in somewhat of the spirit
which is attributed to him in this poem.

Now up the mead, then down the mead,
And past a shady nookAnd, lo! he saw a little boy
That pored upon a book I
"My gentle lad, what is't you readRomance or fairy fable?
Or is it some historic page,
Of kings and crowns unstable?"
The young boy gave an upward glance"It is' The Deathl of Abel.'"
The usher took six hasty strides,
As smit with sudden painSix hasty strides beyond the place,
Then slowly back again;
And down he sat beside the lad,
And talked with him of Cain.
He told how murderers walked the earth,
Beneath the curse of CainWith crimson clouds before their eyes,
And flames about their brain:
For blood has left upon their souls
Its everlasting stain!
"And well," quoth he, "I know, for truth,
Their pangs must be extremeWoe, woe, unutterable woeWho spill life's sacred stream!
For why? Methought, last night, I wrought
A murder in a dream!

I led him to a lonely field,''he moon shone clear and cold:
Now here, said I, this man shall die,
And I will have his gold!

And one with a heavy stone,
One hurried gash with a hasty knifeAnd then the deed was done:
There was nothing lying at my foot,
But lifeless flesh and bone!

That could not do me ill;
And yet I feared him all the more,
For lying there so still:
There was a manhood in his look,
That murder could not kill I

"And, lo t'ne universal air
Seemed lit with ghastly flameTen thousand thousand dreadful eyes,
Were looking down in blame:
I took the dead man by the hand,
And called upon his name!
"O God, it made me qtiake to see
Such sense within the slain!
But when I touched the lifeless clay,
The blood gushed out amain!
For every clot, a burning spot,
Was scorching in my brain!
"And now from forth the frowning sky,
From the heaven's topmost height,
I heard a voice-the awful voice
Of the blood-avenging sprite:-'Thou guilty man! take up thy dead
And hide it from my sight!'

And cast it in a streamA sluggish water, black as ink,
The depth was so extreme.
My gentle boy, remember this

And vanished in the pool;
Anon I cleansed my bloody hands
And washed my forehead cool,
And sat among the urchins young,
That evening in the school!

And mine so black and grim I
I could not share in childish prayer,

Siege of Torquilstone.-scoTT.
THE noise within the castle, occasioned by the defensive preparations, which had been considerable for some time, now
increased into tenfold bustle and clamor. The heavy yet hasty
step of the men-at-arms traversed the battlements, or resounded
on the narrow and winding passages and stairs which led to the
various bartisans and points of defense. The voices of the
knights were heard, animating their followers or directing means
of defense, while their commands were often drowned in the
clashing of armor, or the clamorous shouts of those whom they
addressed. Tremendous as these sounds were, and yet more
terrible from the awful event which they presaged, there was
a sublimity mixed with them which Rebecca's high-toned mind
could feel even in that moment of terror. Her eye kindled,
although the blood fled from her cheeks; and there was a
strong mixture of fear, and of a thrilling sense of the sublime
as she repeated, half whispering to herself, half speaking to her
companion, the sacred text-"' The quiver rattleth-the glittering spear and the shield-the noise of the captains and the
shouting!"
But Ivanhoe was like the war-horse of that sublime passage,
glowing with impatience at his inactivity, and with his ardent
desire to mingle in the affray, of which these sounds were the
introduction.  " If I could but drag myself," he said, " to yonder window, that I might see how this brave game is like to go
-If I had but bow to shoot a shaft, or battle-axe to strike were
it but a single blow for our deliverance! It is in vain-it is in
vain-I am alike nerveless and weaponless!"

"Fret not thyself noble knight," answered Rebecca, "the
sounds have ceased of a sudden-it may be they join not
battle!"
"Thou knowest naught of it," said Wilfred, impatiently;
"this dead pause only shows that the men are at their posts
on the walls, and expecting an instant attack; what we have
heard was but the distant muttering of the storm-it will burst
anon in all its fury. Could I but reach yonder window!"
" Thou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt, noble knight,"
replied his attendant. Observing his extreme solicitude, she
firmly added, " I myself will stand at the lattice, and describe
to you as I can what passes without."
" You must not-you shall not!" exclaimed Ivanhoe; " each
lattice, each aperture, will be soon a mark for the archers; some
random shaft""It shall be welcome!" murmured Rebecca, as with firm
pace she ascended two or three steps which led to the window
of which they spoke.
" Rebecca, dear Rebecca 1!" exclaimed Ivanhoe, "this is no
maiden's pastime-do not expose thyself to wounds and death,
and render me forever miserable for having given occasion; at
least, cover thyself with yonder ancient buckler, and show as
little of your person at the lattice as may be."
Following with wonderful promptitude the directions of Ivanhoe, and availing herself of the protection of the large ancient
shield, which she placed against the lower part of the window,
Rebecca, with tolerable security to herself, could witness part
of what was passing without the castle, and report to Ivanhoe
the preparations which the assailants were making for the storm.
Indeed the situation which she thus obtained was peculiarly
favorable for this purpose, because, being placed on an angle of
the main building, Rebecca could not only see what passed beyond the precincts of the castle, but also commanded a view of
the outwork likely to be the first object of the meditated assault.
It was an exterior fortification of no great height or strength,
intended to protect the postern-gate, through which Cedric had
been recently dismissed by Front-de-Bceuf. The castle-moat
divided this species of barbican from the rest of the fortress, so
that, in case of its being taken, it was easy to cut off the communication with the main building by withdrawing the temporary bridge. In the outwork was a sallyport corresponding to
the postern of the castle, and the whole was surrounded by a
strong palisade. Rebecca could observe, from the number of
men placed for the defense of this post, that the besieged enterSIEGE OF TORQUILSTONE.
tained apprehensions for its safety; and from the musterinlg of
the assailants in a direction nearly opposite to the outwork, it
seemed no less plain that it had been selected as a vulnerable
point of attack.
These appearances she hastily communicated to Ivanhoe, and
added, "The skirts of the wood seem   lined with archers,
although only a few are advanced from its dark shadow."
"Under what banner?" asked Ivanhoe.
"Under no ensign of war which I can observe," answered
Rebecca.
" A singular novelty," muttered the knight, "to advance to
storm such a castle without pennon or banner displayed!Seest thou who they be that act as leaders?"
"A knight, clad in sable armor, is the most conspicuous,"
said the Jewess: "he alone is armed from head to heel, and
seems to assume the direction of all around him."
"What device does he bear on his shield?" replied Ivanhoe.
"Something resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted
blue on the black shield."
"A fetterlock and shacklebolt azure," said Ivanhoe: "I
know not who may bear the device, but well I ween it might
now be mine own. Canst thou not see the motto?"
" Scarce the device itself at this distance," replied Rebecca:
"but when the sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as I
tell you."
" Seem there no other leaders?" exclaimed the anxious inquirer.
" None of mark and distinction that I can behold from this
station," said Rebecca; "but, doubtless, the other side of the
castle is also assailed. They appear even now preparing to
advance-God of Zion protect us! What a dreadful sight!
Those who advance first bear huge shields, and defenses made
of.plank; the othlers follow, bending their bows as they come
on. They raise their bows! God of Moses forgive the creatures thou hast made!"
Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal
for assault, whi:.h was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and
at once answered by a flourish of the Norman trumpets from
the battlements, which, mingled with the deep and hollow
clang of the nakers (a species of kettle-drum), retorted in notes
of defiance the challenge of the enemy. The shouts of both
parties augmentel the fearful din, the assailants crying, 1" Saint
George for merrx England!" and the Normans answering them
147THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
with cries of " En avant de Bracy!-Beau-seant! Beau-seft!
-Front-de-Bcxuf a la rescousse!"
It was not, however, by clamor that the contest was to be
decided, and the desperate efforts of the assailants were met by
an equally vigorous defense on the part of the besieged. The
archers, trained by their woodland pastimes to the most effective use of the long-bow, shot, to use the appropriate phrase of
the time, so 1" wholly together," that no point at which a defender could show the least part of his person, escaped their
cloth-yard shafts. By this heavy discharge, which continued
as thick and sharp as hail, while, notwithstanding, every arrow
had its individual aim, and flew by scores together against each
embrasure and opening in the parapets, as well as at every window where a defender either occasionally had post, or might be
suspected to be stationed--by this sustained discharge two or
three of the garrison were slain, and several others wounded.
But, confident in their armor of proof, and in the cover which
their situation afforded, the followers of Front-de-Boeuf, and his
allies, showed an obstinacy in defense proportioned to the fury
of the attack, and replied with the discharge of their large
cross-bows, as well as with their long-bows, slings, and other
missile weapons, to the close and continued shower of arrows;
and, as the assailants were necessarily but indifferently protected, did considerably more damage than they received at
their hand. The whizzing of shafts and of missiles on both
sides was only interrupted by the shouts which arose when
either side inflicted or sustained some notable loss.
"And I must lie here like a bedridden monk," exclaimed
Ivanhoe, "while the game that gives me freedom or death is
played out by the hand of others! Look from the window once
again, kind maiden, but beware that you are not marked by the
archers beneath. Look out once more, and tell me if they yet
advance to the storm."
With patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she
had employed in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at
the lattice, sheltering herself, however, so as not to be visible
from beneath.
"What dost thou see, Rebecca?" again demanded the'wounded knight.
" Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle
mine eyes, and to hide the bowmen who shoot them."
"That cannot endure," said Ivanhoe; "if they press not
right on to carry the castle by pure force of arms, the archery
148SIEGE OF TORQUILSTONE.
may avail but little against stone walls and bulwarks. Look
for the Knight of the Fetterlock, fair Rebecca, and see how he
bears himself; for as the leader is, so will his followers be."
"I see him not," said.Rebecca.
"Foul craven!" exclaimed Ivanhoe; " does he blench from
the helm when the wind blows highest?"
"He blenches not! he blenches not 1" said Rebecca, "I see
him now; he leads a body of men close under the outer barrier'
of the barbican. They pull down the piles and palisades; they
hew down the barriers with axes. His high black plume floats
abroad over the throng, likkea raven over the field of the slain.
They have made a breach in the barriers-they rush in-they
are thrust back! Front-de-Boeuf heads the defenders; I see
his gigantic form above the press. They throng again to the
breach, and the pass is disputed hand to hand, and man to man.
God of Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce tides-the conflict
of two oceans moved by adverse winds!"
She turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to
endure a sight so terrible.
"Look forth again, Rebecca," said Ivanhoe, mistaking the
cause of her retiring; "the archery must in some degree have
ceased, since they are now fighting hand to hand. Look again,
there is now less danger."
Rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed,
"Holy prophets of the law! Front-de-Bceuf and the Black
Knight fight hand to hand on the breach, amid the roar of
their followers, who watch the progress of the strife-Heaven
strike with the cause of the oppressed and of the captive!" She
then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, " He is down--he is
down!"
"Who is down?" cried Ivanhoe; "for our dear Lady's sake,
tell me which has fallen?"
"The Black Knight," answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again shouted with joyful eagerness-" But no-but
no!-the name of the Lord of Hosts be blessed!-he is on foot
again, and fights as if there were twenty men's strength in his
single arm. His sword is broken--he snatches an axe from a
yeoman-he presses Front-de-Bceuf with blow on blow. The
giant stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the woodman-he falls-he falls!"
"Front-de-Boeuf?" exclaimed Ivanhoe.
"Front-de-Bceuf!" answered the Jewess; "his men rush to
the rescue, headed by the haughty Templar-their united force
1490THE PREACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
compels the champion to pause-they drag Front-de-Bceeuf
within the walls."
" The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?" said
Ivanhoe.
"They have-they have!" exclaimed Rebecca--" and they
press the besieged hard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some swarm like bees, and endeavor to ascend upon the
shoulders of each other-down go stones, beams, and trunks of
trees upon their heads, and as fast as they bear the wounded
to the rear, fresh men supply their places in the assault. Great
God! hast thou given men thine own image, that it should be
thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!"
"Think not of that," said Ivanhoe; " this is no time for such
thoughts. Who yield?--who push their way?"
"The ladders are thrown down," replied Rebecca, shuddering; "the soldiers lie grovelling under them like crushed reptiles-the besieged have the better."
"Saint George strike for us!" exclaimed the knight; "do
the false yeomen give way?"
" No!" exclaimed Rebecca, "they bear themselves right yeomanly-the Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge
axe-the thundering blows which he deals, you may hear them
above all the din and shouts of the battle-stones and beams
are hailed down on the bold champion-he regards them no
more than if they were thistle-down or feathers!"
"By Saint John of Acre," said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his couch, "methought there was but one man in
England that might do such a deed!"
" The postern gate shakes," continued Rebecca; it crashesit is splintered by his blows-they rush in-the outwork is
won. Oh, God!-they hurl the defenders from the battlements
-they throw them into the moat. O men, if ye be indeed men,
spare them that can resist no longer!"
"The bridge-the bridge which communicates with the castle-have they won that pass?" exclaimed Ivanhoe.
"No," replied Rebecca, "the Templar has destroyed the
plank on which they crossed-few of the defenders escaped
with him into the castle-the shrieks and cries which you hear
tell the fate of the others. Alas! I see it is still more difficult
to look upon victory than upon battle."
"What do they now, maiden?" said Ivanhoe; "look forth
yet again-this is no time to faint at bloodshed."
"It is over for the time," answered Rebecca; "our friends
150strengthen themselves within the outwork which they have
mastered, and it affords them so good a shelter from the foeman's shot, that the garrison only bestow a few bolts on it from
interval to interval, as if rather to disquiet than effectually to
injure them."
"Our friends," said Wilfred, "will surely not abandon an
enterprise so gloriously begun and so happily attained. O no!
I will put my faith in the good knight whose axe hath rent
heart-of-oak and bars of iron.  Singular," he again muttered to
himself, "if there be two who can do a deed of such derrinydo!-a fetterlock and a shacklebolt on a field-sable-what may
that mean?--seest thou. naught else, Rebecca, by which the
Black Knight may be distinguished?"
"Nothing," said the Jewess; " all about him is black as the
wing of the night raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him
farther--but having once seen him put forth his strength in
battle, methinks I could know him again among a thousand
warriors. He rushes to the fray as if he were summoned to a
banquet.  There is more than mere strength, there seems as if
the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every
blow which he deals upon his enemies. God assoilzie him of
the sin of bloodshed!--it is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold
how the arm and heart of one man can triumph over hundreds."
The Arsenal.-LoNGFELLOW.
THIS is the Arsenal. From floor to ceiling,
Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms;
But from their silent pipes no anthem pealing
Startles the villages with strange alarms.
Ah! what a sound will rise, how wild and dreary,
When the death-angel touches those swift keys I
What loud lament and dismal Miserere
Will mingle with their awful symphonies!
I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus,
The cries of agony, the endless groan,
Which, through the ages that have gone before us,
In long reverberations reach our own.
On helm and harness rings the Saxon hammer,
Through Cimbric forest roars the Norseman's song,
THE ARSENAL.
151THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
And loud, amid the universal clamor,
O'er distant deserts sounds the Tartar gong.
I hear the Florentine, who from his palace
Wheels out his battle-bell with dreadful din,
And Aztec priests upon their teocallis
Beat the wild war-drums rade of serpent's skin
The tumult of each sacked and burning village;
The shout that every prayer for mercy drowns;
The soldier's revels in the midst of pillage;
The wail of famine in beleaguered towns;
The bursting shell, the gateway wrenched asunder,
The rattling musketry, the clashing blade;
And ever and anon, in tones of thunder,
The diapason of the cannonade.
Is it, 0 man, with such discordant noises,
With such accursed instruments as these,
Thou drownest Nature's sweet and kindly voices,
And jarrest the celestial harmonies?
Were half the power, that fills the world with terror,
Were half the wealth, bestowed on camps and courts,
Given to redeem the human mind from error,
There were no need of arsenals nor forts:
The warrior's name would be a name abhorred
And every nation, that should lift again
Its hand against a brother, on its forehead
Would wear forevermore the curse of Cain!
Down the dark future, through long generations,
The echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease;
And like a bell, with solemn, sweet vibrations,
I hear once more the voice of Christ say, " Peace!"
Peace! and no longer from its brazen portals
The blast of War's great organ shakes the skies I
But beautiful as songs of the immortals,
The holy melodies of love arise.
Compromise Bill of 1833.-H. CLAY.
STATESMEN should regulate their conduct, and adapt their
measures to the exigencies of the times in which they live.
They cannot, indeed, transcend the limits of the constitutional
rule: but with resDect to those systems of Dolicv which fall
152COMPROMISE BILL OF 1833
within its scope, they should arrange them  according to the
interests, the wants, and the prejudices of the people. Two
great dangers threaten the public safety. The true patriot will
not stop to inquire how they have been brought about, but will
fly to the deliverance of his country.  The difference between
the friends and the foes of the compromise, under consideration,
is, that they would, in the enforcing act, send forth alone a
flaming sword. We would send out that also, but along with
it the olive branch, as a messenger of peace. They cry out,
the law! the law! the law!  Power! power! power!   We,
too, reverence the law, and bow to the supremnacy of its obligation; but we are in favor of the law executed in mildness, and
a power tempered with mercy.    They, as we think, would
hazard a civil commotion, beginning in South Carolina, and extending, God only knows where. While we would vindicate
the Federal Government, we are for peace, if possible, union,
and liberty. We want no war; above all, no civil war, no
family strife. We want no sacked cities, no desolated fields,
no smoking ruins, no streams of American blood shed by
American arms!
I have been accused of ambition in presenting this measure.
Ambition! inordinate ambition!  If I had thought of myself
only, I should have never brought it forward. I know well
the perils to which I expose myself; the risk of alienating
faithful and valued friends, with but little prospect of making
new ones, if any new ones could compensate for the loss of
those whom we have long tried and loved; and the honest misconceptions both of friends and foes.  Ambition!  If I had
listened to its soft and seducing whispers; if I had yielded
myself to the dictates of a cold, calculating, and prudential
policy, I would have stood still and unmoved. I might even
have silently gazed on the raging storm, enjoyed its loudest
thunders, and left those who are charged with the care of the
vessel of State, to conduct it as they could. I have been heretofore often unjustly accused of ambition.  Low, grovelling
souls, who are utterly incapable of elevating themselves to the
higher and nobler duties of pure patriotism-beings who, for
ever keeping their own selfish aims in view, decide all public
measures by their presumed influence on their aggrandizement-judge me by the venal rule which they prescribe to
themselves. I have given to the winds those false accusations,
as I consign that which now impeaches my motives.  I have
no desire for office, not even the highest. The most exalted is
but a prison, in which the. incarcerated incumbent daily re7*

ceives his cold, heartless visitants, marks his weary hours,
and is cut off from the practical enjoyment of all the blessings
of genuine freedom.  I am no candidate for any office in the
gift of the people of these States, united or separated; I never
wish, never expect to be. Pass this bill, tranquillize the country, restore confidence and affection in the Union, and I am
willing to go home to Ashland, and renounce public service for
ever. I should there find, in its groves, under its shades, on
its lawns, amidst my flocks and herds, in the bosom of my
family, sincerity and truth, attachment, and fidelity, and gratitude, which I have not always found in the walks of public
life. Yes, I have ambition; but it is the ambition of being the
humble instrument, in the hands of Providence, to reconcile a
divided people; once more to revive concord and harmony in a
distracted land-the pleasing ambition of contemplating the
glorious spectacle of a free, united, prosperous, and fraternal
people!
Adams and Jeff'erson.-E. EVERETT.
THE jubilee of America is turned into mourning. Its joy is
mingled with sadness; its silver trumpet breathes a mingled
strain. Henceforward and for ever, while America exists among
the nations of the earth, the first emotion on the Fourth of
July, shall be of joy and triumph in the great event which
immortalizes the day; the second shall be one of chastised and
tender recollection of the venerable men who departed on the
morning of the jubilee.  This mingled emotion of triumph and
sadness has sealed the moral beauty and sublimity of our great
anniversary.  In the simple commemoration of a victorious
political achievement, there seems not enough to occupy all our
purest and best feelings. The fourth of July was before a day
of unshaded triumph, exultation, and national pride; but the
angel of death has mingled in the all-glorious pageant, to teach
us we are men. Had our venerated fathers left us on any other
day, the day of the united departure of two such men would
henceforward have been remembered but as a day of mourning.
But now, while their decease has gently chastened the exultations of the triumphant festival, the banner of independence
will wave cheerfully over the spot where they repose,  The
154ADAMS AND JEFFERSON.
-whole nation feels, as with one heart, that since it must sooner
or later have been bereaved of its revered fathers, it could not
have wished that any other had been the day of their decease.
Our anniversary festival was before triumphant; it is now
triumphant and sacred.  It before called out the young.and
ardent, to join in the public rejoicings; it now also speaks, in a
touching voice, to the retired, to the grey-headed, to the mild
and peaceful spirits, to the whole family of sober freemen.
With some appeal of joy, of admiration, of tenderness, it henceforth addresses every American heart.  It is henceforward,
what the dying Adams pronounced it, a great and a good day.
It is full of greatness and full of goodness.  It is absolute and
complete. The death of the men who declared our independence-their death on the day of the jubilee-was all that was
wanting to the fourth of July. To die on that day, and to die
together, was all that was wanting to Jefferson and Adams.
Think not, fellow citizens, that in the mere formal discharge
of my duty this day, I would overrate the melancholy interest
of the great occasion. Heaven knows, I do anything but intentionally overrate it. I labor only for words to do justice to
your feelings and to mine. I can say nothing which does not
sound as cold, as tame, and as inadequate to myself as to you.
The theme is too great and too surprising, the men are too
great and good, to be spoken of in this cursory manner. There
is too much in the contemplation of their united characters,
their services, the day and coincidence of their death, to be
properly described, or to be fully felt, at once. I dare not come
here and dismiss, in a few summary paragraphs, the characters
of men who have filled such a space in the history of their age.
It would be a disrespectful familiarity with men of their lofty
spirits, their rich endowments, their deep counsels, and wise
measures, their long and honorable lives, to endeavor thus to
weigh and estimate them. I leave that arduous task to the
genius of kindred elevation, by whom to-morrow it will be discharged. I feel the mournful contrast in the fortunes of the
first and best of men, that after a life in the highest walks of
usefulness; after conferring benefits, not merely on a neighborhood, a city, or even a St:te, but on a whole continent, and a
posterity of kindred men; q fter having stood in the first estimation for talents, services, and influence among millions of fellow
citizens, a day should come which closes all up; pronounces a
brief blessing on their memory; gives an hour to the actions of
a crowded life; describes in a sentence what it took years to
bring to pass, and what is destined, for years and ages, to con155THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
tinue and operate on posterity; forces into a few words the
riches of busy days of action and weary nights of meditation;
passes forgetfully over many traits of character, many counsels
and measures, which it cost perhaps years of discipline and
effo.rt to mature; utters a funeral prayer; chants a mournful
anthem; and then dismisses all into the dark eohambers of death
and forgetfulness.
But no, fellow citizens, we dismiss them not to the chambers
of forgetfulness and death. What we admired, and prized, and
venerated in them can never die, nor, dying, be forgotten. I
had almost said that they are now beginning to live; to live
that life of unimpaired influence, of unclouded fame, of unmingled happiness, for which their talents and services were
destined. They were of the select few, the least portion of
whose life dwells in their physical existence; whose hearts have
watched, while their senses have slept; whose souls have grown
up into a higher being; whose pleasure is to be useful; whose
wealth is an unblemished reputation; who respire the breath of
honorable fame; who have deliberately and consciously put
what is called life to hazard, that they may live in the hearts of
those who come after. Such men do not, cannot die. To be
cold, and motionless, and breathless; to feel not and speak
not; this is not the end of existence to the men who have
breathed their spirits into the institutions of their country, who
have stamped their characters on the pillars of the age, who
have poured their hearts' blood into the channels of the, public
prosperity. Tell me, ye who tread the sods of yon sacred
height, is Warren dead? Can you not still see him, not pale
and prostrate, the blood of his gallant heart pouring out of his
ghastly wound, but moving resplendent over the field of honor,
with the rose of heaven upon his cheek, and the fire of liberty
in his eye? Tell me, ye who make your pious pilgrimage to
the shades of Vernon, is Washington indeed shut up in that
cold and narrow house? That which made these men, and men
like these, cannot die.  The hand that traced the charter of
independence is indeed motionless, the eloquent lips that sustained it are hushed; but the lofty spirits that conceived, resolved, matured, maintained it, and which alone, to such men,
make it life to live," these cannot expire:
"These shall resist the empire of decay,
When time is o'er, and worlds have passed away:
Cold in the dust the perished heart may lie,
But that which warmed it once can never die."
156PARTIES AND PARTY MEN
Parties and Party Men.-WILLIAM GASTON.
THREATS of resistance, secession, separation, have become
common as household words, in the wicked and silly violence of
public declaimers. The public ear is familiarized, and the public mind will soon be accustomed, to the detestable suggestions
of DISUNION! Calculations and conjectures, What may the
East do without the South, and what may the South do without
the East?-sneers, nmenaces, reproaches, and recriminations, all
tend to the same fatal end! What can the East do without the
South? What can the South do without the East?
If it must be so, let parties and party men continue to quarrel with little or no regard to the public good. They may
mystify themselves and others with disputations on political
economy, proving the most opposite doctrines to their own
satisfaction, and perhaps to the conviction of no one else on
earth. They may deserve reprobation for their selfishness, their
violence, their errors, or their wickedness. They may do our
country much harm. They may retard its growth, destroy its
harmony, impair its character, render its institutions unstable,
pervert the public mind, and deprave the public morals. These
are, indeed, evils, and sore evils; but the principle of life remains, and will yet struggle, with assured success, over these
temporary maladies.
Still we are great, glorious, united, and free; still we have a
name that is revered abroad, and loved at home-a name which
is a tower of strength to us against foreign wrong, and a bond
of internal union and harmony-a name which no enemy pronounces but with respect, and which no citizen hears but with
a throb of exultation. Still we have that blessed Constitution,
which, with all its pretended defects, and all its alleged violations, has conferred more benefit on man than ever yet flowed
from any other human institution--which has established justice, insured domestic tranquillity, provided for the common
defense, promoted the general welfare, and which, under God,
if we be true to ourselves, will insure the blessings of liberty
to us and our posterity.
Surely, such a country, and such a Constitution, have claims
upon you, my friends, which cannot be disregarded. I entreat
and adjure you, then, by all that is near and dear to you on
earth, by all the obligations of patriotism, by the memory of
your fathers who fell in the great and glorious struggle, for the
sake of your sons, whom you would not have to blush for your

The Prairie on Fire.-CooPER.
THE sleep of the fugitives lasted for several hours. The
trapper was the first to shake off its influence, as he had been
the last to court its refreshment. Rising, just as the gray light
of day began to brighten that portion of the studded vault
which rested on the eastern margin of the plain, he summoned
his companions from their warm lairs, and pointed out the
necessity of their being once more on the alert....
"See, Middleton!" exclaimed Inez, in a sudden burst of
youthful pleasure, that caused her for a moment to forget her
situation. "How lovely is that sky; surely it contains a promise of happier times!"
"It is glorious!" returned her husband.  "Glorious and
heavenly is that streak of vivid red, and here is a still brighter
crimson--rarely have I seen a richer rising of the sun."
"Rising of the sun 1" slowly repeated the old man, lifting
his tall person from its seat, with a deliberate and abstracted
air, while he kept his eye riveted on the changing, and certainly
beautiful tints that were garnishing the vault of heaven.
"Rising of the sun! I like not such risings of the sun. Ah's
me! the imps have circumvented us with a vengeance. The
prairie is on fire!"
" God in heaven protect us,!" cried Middleton, catching Inez
to his bosom under the instant impression of the imminence of
their danger.  "There is no time to lose, old man; each instant
is a day; let us fly."
"Whither?" demanded the trapper, motioning him with
calmness and dignity, to arrest his steps.  "In this wilderness
of grass and reeds, you are like a vessel in the broad lakes
without a compass. A single step on the wrong course might
prove the destruction of us all.  It is seldom danger is so
pressing that there is not time enough for reason to do its work,
young officer; therefore, let us await its biddings."
158THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE
"For my own part," said Paul Hover, looking about him
with no unequivocal expressioR of concern, "I acknowledge,
that should this dry bed of weeds get fairly in a flame, a bee
would have to make a flight higher than common to prevent his
wings from scorching. Therefore, old trapper, I agree with the
captain, and say mount and run."
"Ye are wrong--ye are wrong-man is not a beast to follow
the gift of instinct, and to snuff up his knowledge by a taint in
the air, or a rumbling in the sound; but he must see and reason,
and then conclude. So follow me a little to the left, where
there is a rise in the ground, whenae we may make our reconnoiterings."
The old man waved his hand with authority, and led the way
without further parlance to the spot he had indicated, followed
by the whole of his alarmed companions. An eye less practised than that of the trapper might have failed in discovering
the gentle elevation to which he alluded, and which looked on
the surface of the meadow like a growth a little taller than common. When they reached the place, however, the stinted grass
itself announced the absence of that moisture which had fed
the rank weeds of most of the plain, and furnished a clue to
the evidence by which he had judged of the formation of the
ground hidden beneath. Here a few minutes were lost in breaking down the tops of the surrounding herbage, which, notwithstanding the advantage of their position, rose even above the
heads of Middleton and Paul, and in obtaining a look-out that
might command a view of the surrounding sea of fire....
The examination which his companions so instantly and so
intently made, rather served to assure them of their desperate
situation than to appease their fears.  Huge columns of smoke
were rolling up from the plain, and thickening in gloomy masses
around the horizon.  The red glow which gleamed upon their
enormous folds, now lighting their volumes with the glare of
the conflagration, now flashed to another point, as the flame
beneath glided ahead, leaving all behind enveloped in awful
darkness, and proclaiming louder than words the character of
the imminent and rapidly approaching danger.
"This is terrible!" exclaimed Middleton, folding, the trembling Inez to his heart. "At such a time as this, and in such
a manner 1"
"The gates of heaven are open to all who truly believe,"
murmured the pious devotee in his bosom.
"This resignation is maddening! But we are men, and will
make a struggle for our lives! How now, my brave and spirited
159TdE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
friend, shall we yet mount and lp ush across the flames, or shall
we stand here and see those we-most love perish in this frightful manner without an effort?"
" I am for a swarming time, and a flight before the hive is
too hot to hold us," said the bee-hunter, to whom it will be at
once seen that the half-distracted Middleton addressed himself.
" Come, old trapper, you must acknowledge this is but a slow
way of getting out of danger. If we tarry here much longer,
it will be in the fashion that the bees lie around the straw
after the hive has been smoked for its honey. You may hear
the fire begin to roar already, and I know by experience, that
when the flame once gets fairly into the prairie grass, it is no
sloth that can outrun it."
"Think you," returned the old man, pointing scornfully at
the mazes of the dry and matted grass which environed them,
"that mortal feet can outstrip the speed of fire on such a path?"
"What say you, friend doctor," cried the bewildered Paul,
turning to the naturalist, with that sort of helplessness with
which the strong are often apt to seek the aid of the weak,
when human power is baffled by the hand of a mightier being,
"what say you; have you no advice to give away, in a case of
life and death?"
The naturalist stood, tablets in hand, looking at the awful
spectacle with as much composure as though the conflagration
had been lighted in order to solve the difficulties of some scientific problemn. Aroused by the question of his companion, he
turned to his equally calm though differently occupied associate,
the trapper, demanding, with the most provoking insensibility
to the urgent nature of their situation--" Venerable hunter, you
have often witnessed similar prismatic experiments"He was rudely interrupted by Paul, who struck the tablets
from his hands with a violence that betrayed the utter intellectual confusion which had overset the equanimity of his mind.
Before time was allowed for remonstrance, the old man, who
had continued during the whole scene like one much at a loss
how to proceed, though also like one who was rather perplexed
than alarmed, suddenly assumed a decided air, as if he no longer
doubted on the course it was most advisable to pursue.
"It is time to be doing," he said, interrupting the controversy that was about to ensue between the naturalist and the
bee-hunter; "it is time to leave off books and moanings, and
to be doing."
"You have come to your recollections too late, miserable old

mile of us, and the wind is bringing them down in this quarter
with dreadful rapidity."
"Anan! the flames! I care but little for the flames. If I
only knew how to circumvent the cunning of the Tetons, as I
know how to cheat the fire of its prey, there would be nothing
needed but thanks to the Lord for our deliverance. Do you
call this a fire? If you had seen what I have witnessed in
the eastern hills, when mighty mountains were like the furnace
of a smith, you would have known what it was to fear the
flames, and to be thankful that you were spared! Come, lads,
come;'tis time to be doing now, and to cease talking; for yonder curling flame is truly coming on like a trotting moose. Put
hands upon this short and withered grass where we stand, and
lay bare the'arth."
"Would you think to deprive the fire of its victims in this
childish manner?" exclaimed Middleton.
A faint but solemn smile passed over the features of the old
man as he answered-" Your gran'ther would have said, that
when the enemy was nigh, a soldier could do no better than to
obey."
The captain felt the reproof, and instantly began to imitate
the industry of Paul, who was tearing the decayed herbage
from the ground in a sort of desperate compliance with the
trapper's direction. Even Ellen lent her hands to the labor,
nor was it long before Inez was seen similarly employed, though
none amongst them knew why or wherefore.   When life is
thought to be the reward of labor, men are wont to be industrious. A very few moments. sufficed to lay bare a spot of some
twenty feet in diameter. Into one edge of this little area the
trapper brought the females, directing Middleton and Paul to
cover their light and inflammable dresses with the blankets of
the party. So soon as this precaution was observed, the old
man approached the opposite margin of the grass, which still
environed them in a tall and dangerous circle, and selecting a
handful of the driest of the herbage, he placed it over the pan
of his rifle. The light combustible kindled at the flash. Then
he placed the little flame into a bed of the standing fog, and
withdrawing from the spot to the centre of the ring, he patiently awaited the result.
The subtle element seized with avidity upon its new fuel, and
in a moment forked flames were gliding among the grass, as
the tongues of ruminating animals are seen rolling among their
food, apparently in quest of its sweetest portions.
"Now," said the old man, holding up a finger and laughing
161THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
in his peculiarly silent manner, "you shall see fire fight fire!
Ah's me! many is the time I have burnt a smootly path from
wanton laziness to pick my way across a tangled bottom."
"But is this not fatal?" cried the amazed Middleton; "are
you not bringing the enemy nigher to us instead of avoiding it?"
"Do you scorch so easily?-your gran'ther had a tougher
skin. But we shall live to see; we shall all live to see."
The experience of the trapper was in the right. As the fire
gained strength and heat it began to spread on three sides,
dying of itself on the fourth for want of aliment. As it increased, and the sullen roaring announced its power, it cleared
everything before it, leaving the black and smoking soil far
more naked than if the scythe had swept the place. The situation of the fugitives would have still been hazardous, had not
the area enlarged as the flame encircled them.  But by advancing to the spot where the trapper had kindled the grass,
they avoided the heat, and in a very few moments the flames
began to recede in every quarter, leaving them enveloped in a
cloud of smoke, but perfectly safe from the torrent of fire that
was still furiously rolling onward.
The spectators regarded the simple expedient of the trapper
with that species of wonder with which the courtiers of Ferdinand are said to have viewed the manner in which Columbus
made his egg to stand on its end, though with feelings that
were filled with gratitude instead of envy.
"Most wonderful!" said Middleton, when he saw the complete success of the means by which they had been rescued
friom a danger that he had conceived to be unavoidable. " The
thought was a gift from heaven, and the hand that executed
it should be immortal."
s" Old trapper," cried Paul, thrusting his fingers through his
shaggy locks, " I have lined many a loaded bee into his hole,
and know something of the nature of the woods, but this is
robbing a hornet of his sting without touching the insect!"
"It will do, it will do," returned the old man, who after the
first moment of his success seemed to think no more of the exploit.... "Let the flames do their work for a short half hour,
and then we will mount. That time is needed to cool the meadow,
for these unshod beasts are tender on the hoof as a barefooted
girl."
The veteran, on whose experience tlley all so implicitly relied
for protection, employed himself in reconnoitering objects in the
distance, through the openings wlich the air occasionally made
in the immense bodies of smoke, that by this time lay in enormous piles on every part of the plain.

It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,

mechanical rules above the promptings of NATURED and the

that Elocution should be viewed as an,Esthetic, rather

INTRODUCTION.THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
The Boarding House.-DIcKENs.
MRS. TIBBS was, beyond all dispute, the most tidy, fidgety,
thrifty little personage that ever inhaled the smoke of London;
and the house of Mrs. Tibbs was decidedly the neatest in all
Great Coram-street. The area and the area steps, and the
street-door and the street-door steps, and the brass handle, and
the door-plate, and the knocker, and the fan-light, were all as
clean and bright as indefatigable whitewashing, and heart-stoning, and scrubbing and rubbing could make them. The wonder
was, that the brass door-plate, with the interesting inscription
"MRS. TIBBS," had never caught fire from constant friction, so
perseveringly was it polished. There were meat-safe-looking
blinds in the parlor windows, blue and gold curtains in the
drawing-room, and spring-roller blinds, as Mrs. Tibbs was wont
in the pride of her heart to boast, "all the way up." The belllamp in the passage looked as clear as a soap-bubble; you
could see yourself in all the tables, and French-polish yourself
on any one of the chairs. The balusters were bees'-waxed,
and the very stair-wires made your eyes wink, they were so
glittering.
Mrs. Tibbs was somewhat short of stature, and Mr. Tibbs
was by no means a large man. He had, moreover, very short
legs, but, by way of indemnification, his face was peculiarly long.
He was to his wife what the 0 is in 90--he was of some importance with her- he was nothing without her. Mrs. Tibbs was
always talking. Mr. Tibbs rarely spoke; but if it were at any
time possible to put in a word, just when he should have said
nothing at all, he did it. Mrs. Tibbs detested long stories, and
Mr. Tibbs had one, the conclusion of which had never been
heard by his most intimate friends. It always began, "I recollect when I was in the volunteer corps, in eighteen hundred and
six"-but as he spoke very slowly and softly, and his better
half very quickly and loudly, he rarely got beyond the introduQtory sentence. He was a melancholy specimen of the storyteller. He was the wandering Jew of Joe Millerism.
Mr. Tibbs enjoyed a small independence from the pensionlist-about 431. 15s. 10d. a year. His father, mother, and five
interesting scions from the same stock drew a like sum from the
revenue of a grateful country, though for what particular service was never distinctly known. But as this said independence was not quite sufficient to furnish two people with all the
luxuries of this life, it had occurred to the busy little spouse of
168THE BOARDING HOUSE.
Tibbs, that the best thing she could do with a legacy of 7001.
would be to take and furnish a tolerable house, somewhere in
that partially-explored tract of country which lies between the
British Museum, and a remote village called Somers Town, for
the reception of boarders. Great Coram-street was the spot
pitched upon. The house had been furnished accordingly; two
female servants and a boy engaged, and an advertisement inserted in the morning papers, informing the public that "Six
individuals would meet with all the comforts of a cheerful
musical home in a select private family, residing within ten minutes' walk of everywhere."  Answers out of number were
received, with all sorts of initials; all the letters of the alphabet
seemed to be seized with a sudden wish to go out boarding and
lodging; voluminous was the correspondence between Mrs.
Tibbs and the applicants, and most profound was the secrecy
which was to be observed. "E." didn't like this, and "I."
couldn't think of putting up with that; "I. O. U." didn't think
the terms would suit him; and " G. R." had never slept in a
French bed. The result, however, was, that three gentlemen
became inmates of Mrs. Tibbs's house, on terms which were
" agreeable to all parties." In went the advertisement again,
and a lady with her two daughters proposed to increase-not
their families, but Mrs. Tibbs's.
" Charming woman, that Mrs. Maplesone!" said Mrs. Tibbs,
as she and her spouse were sitting by the fire after breakfast;
the gentlemen having gone out on their several avocations.
" Charming woman, indeed 1" repeated little Mrs. Tibbs, more
by way of soliloquy than anything else, for she never thought
of consulting her husband. " And the two daughters are
delightful. We must have some fish to-day; they'll join us at
dinner for the first time."
Mr. Tibbs placed the poker at right angles with the fireshovel, and essayed to speak, but recollected he had nothing to
say.
"The young ladies;" continued Mrs. T., "have kindly volunteered to bring their own piano."
Tibbs thought of the volunteer story, but did not venture it.
A bright thought struck him--
" It's very likely," said he.
"Pray don't lean your head against the paper," interrupted
Mrs. Tibbs-" and don't put your feet on the steel fender;
that's worse."
Tibbs took his head from the paper, and his feet from the
fender, and proceeded. "It's very likely one of the young

ladies may set bhtr cap at young Mr. Simpson, and you know a
marriage"
"A what!" shrieked Mrs. Tibbs. Tibbs modestly repeated
his former suggestion.
" I beg you wont mention such a thing," said Mrs. T.'" A
marriage, indeed!-to rob me of my boarders--no, not for the
world."
Tibbs thought in his own mind that the event was by no
means unlikely, but as he never argued with his wife, he put a
stop to the dialogue, by observing it was "time to go to business."  He always went out at ten o'clock in the morning, and
returned at five in the afternoon, with an exceedingly dirty face,
and smelling very mouldy. Nobody knew what he was, or
where he went to; but Mrs. Tibbs used to say, with an air of
great importance, that he was engaged in the City.
The Miss Maplesones and their accomplished parent arrived
in the course of the afternoon in a hackney-coach, and accompanied by a most astonishing number of packages. Trunks,
bonnet-boxes, muff-boxes, and parasols, guitar-cases, and parcels of all imaginable shapes, done up in brown paper, and
fastened with pins, filled the passage. Then, there was such a
running up and down with the luggage, such scampering for
warm water for the ladies to wash in, and such a bustle, and
confusion, and heating of servants and curling-irons, as had
never been known in Great Coram-street before. Little Mrs.
Tibbs was quite in her element, bustling about, talking incessantly, and distributing towels and soap, and all the et cceteras,
like a head-nurse in a hospital. The house was not restored to
its usual state of quiet repose until the ladies were safely shut
up in their respective bed-rooms, engaged in the important occupation of dressing for dinner.
"Are these gals andsome?" inquired Mr. Simpson of M1.
Septimus Hicks, another of the boarders, as they were amusing
themselves in the drawing-room before dinner, by lolling on the
sofas, and contemplating their pumps.
"Don't know," replied Mr. Septimus Hicks, who was a tallish, white-faced young man, with spectacles, and a black ribbon
round his neck instead of a neckerchief-a most interesting person; a poetical walker of the hospitals, and a "very talented
young man."   He was fond of "lugging" into conversation all
sorts of quotations from Don Juan, without fettering himself
by the propriety of their application, in which particular he was
remarkably independent. The other, Mr. Simpson, was one of
those young men, who are in society what walking gentlemen

are upon the stage, only infinitely worse skilled in his vocation
than the most indifferent artist. He was as empty headed as
the great bell of St. Paul's; always dressed according to the
caricatures published in the monthly fashions, and spelt Character with a K.
" I saw a devilish number of parcels in the passage when I
came home," simpered Simpson.
"Materials for the toilet, no doubt," rejoined the Don Juan
reader.
-" Much linen, lace, and several pair
Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete;
With other articles of ladies fair,
To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat."
"Is that from Milton?" inquired Mr. Simpson.
"No-from Byron," returned Mr. Hicks, with a look of profound contempt. He was quite sure of his author, because he
had never read any other. " Hush!" said the sapient hospital
walker, "Here come the gals," and they both commenced talking in a very loud key.
" Mrs. Maplesone and the Miss Maplesones, Mr. Hicks.
Mr. Hicks-Mrs. Maplesone and the Miss tlaplesones," said
Mrs. Tibbs with a very red face, for she had been superintending the cooking operations below stairs, and looked like a wax
doll on a sunny day. " Mr. Simpson, I beg your pardon-Mr.
Simpson-Mrs. Maplesone and the Miss Maplesones"-and vice
versa. The gentlemen immediately began to slide about with
much politeness, and to look as if they wished their arms had
been legs, so little did they know what to do with them. The
ladies smiled, curtsied, and glided into chairs, and dived for
dropping pocket-handkerchiefs: the gentlemen leant against two
of the curtain-pegs; Mrs. Tibbs went through an admirable bit of
serious pantomime with a servant who had come up to ask some
question about fish-sauce, and then the two young ladies looked
at each other; and every body else appeared to discover something very attractive in the pattern of the fender.
"Julia, my love," said Mrs. Maplesone to her youngest
daughter, in a tone just loud enough for the remainder of the
company to hear--" Julia."
"Yes, Ma."
" Don't stoop." This was said for the purpose of directing
general attention to Miss Julia's figure, which was undeniable.
Every body looked at her accordingly, and there was anothex
pause.
1712THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
"We had the most uncivil hackney-coachman to-day, you
can imagine," said Mrs. Maplesone to Mrs. Tibbs, in a confidential tone.
" Dear me!" replied the hostess, with an air of great commiseration. She couldn't say more, for the servant again appeared
at the door, and commenced telegraphing most earnestly to her
"M Iisses."
"I think hackney-coachmen generally are uncivil," said Mr.
Hicks in his most insinuating tone.
"Positively I think they are," replied Mrs. Maplesone, as if
the idea had never struck her before.
"And cabmen, too," said Mr. Simpson. This remark was a
failure, for no one intimated by word or sign the slightest knowledge of the manners and customs of cabmen.
"Robinson, what do you want?" said Mrs. Tibbs to the
servant who, by way of making her presence known to her mistress, had been giving sundry hems and sniffs outside the door
during the preceding five minutes.
"Please, ma'am, master wants his clean things," replied tlhe
servant, completely taken off her guard. There -was no resisting this: the two young men turined their faces to the window,
and "went off" like a couple of bottles of ginger beer; the
ladies put their handkerchiefs to their mouths, and little lMrs.
Tibbs bustled out of the room to give Tibbs his clean linenand the servant warning.
Mr. Calton, the remaining boarder, shortly afterwards made
his appearance, and proved a surprising promoter of the conversation. Mr. Calton was a superannuated beau-an old boy.
He used'to say of himself that although his features were not
regularly handsome, they were striking. They certainly were:
it was impossible to look at his face without being forcibly reminded of a chubby street-door knocker, half-iron, half-monkey;
and the comparison might be extended to his whole character
and conversation. He had stood still while everything else had
been moving. He never originated a conversation, or started a
new idea; but if any commonplace topic were broached, or, to
pursue the comparison, if any body lifted him up, he would
hammer away with surprising rapidity. He had the tic-doloureux occasionally, and then he might be said to be muffled,
because he did not make quite as much noise as at other times,
when he would go on prosing, rat-tat-tat the same thing over
and over again. He had never been married; but he was still
on the look-out for a wife with money. He had a life interest
worth about 3001 a year-he was exceedingly vain, and inordi1.72THE BOARDING HOUSE.
nately selfish. He had acquired the reputation of being the
very pink of politeness, and he walked round the park, and up
Regent-stre.et every day.
This respectable personage had made up his mind to render
himself exceedingly agreeable to Mrs. Maplesone--indeed, the
desire of being as amiable as possible extended itself to the
whole party; Mrs. Tibbs having considered it an admirable little
bit of management to represent to the gentlemen that she had
some reason to believe the ladies were fortunes, and to hint to
the ladies, that all the gentlemen were " eligible." A little flirtation, she thought, might keep her house full, without leading
to any other result.
Mrs. Maplesone was an enterprising widow of about fifty:
shrewd, scheming, and good-looking. She was amiably anxious
on behalf of her daughters; in proof whereof she used to remark, that she would have no objection to marry again, if it
would benefit her dear girls-she could have no other motive.
The " dear girls" themselves were not at all insensible to the
merits of "a good establishment."  One of them was twentyfive, the other three years younger. They had been at different
watering-places for four seasons; they had gambled at libraries, read books in balconies, sold at fancy fairs, danced at
assemblies, talked sentiment-in short, they had done all that
industrious girls could do-and all to no purpose.
"What a magnificent dresser Mr. Simpson is?" whispered
Matilda Maplesone to her sister Julia.
" Splendid!" returned the youngest. The magnificent individual alluded to wore a sort of maroon-colored dress-coat, with
a velvet collar and cuffs of the same tint-very like that which
usually invests the form of the distinguished unknown who condescends to play the "swell" in the pantomime at "Richardson's Show."
" What whiskers!" said Miss Julia.
" Charming 1" responded her sister; "and what hair 1"  His
hair was like a wig, and distinguished by that insinuating wave
which graces the shining locks of those chef-d'ceuvres of peruquerian art surmounting the waxen images in Bartellot's window,
in Regent-street; his whiskers, meeting beneath his chin, seemed
strings wherewith to tie it on, ere science had rendered them
unnecessary by her patent invisible springs.
"Dinner's on the table, ma'am, if you please," said the boy,
who now appeared for the first time, in a revived black coat of
his master's,
"Oh! Mr. Calton, will you lead Mrs. Maplesone?-Thank
173THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
you."  Mr. Simpson offered his arm to Miss Julia; Mr. Septimus Hicks escorted the lovely Matilda; and the procession
proceeded to the dining-room. Mr. Tibbs was introduced, and
Mr. Tibbs bobbed up and down to the three ladies like a figure
in a Dutch clock with a powerful spring in the middle of his
body, and then dived rapidly into his seat at the bottom of the
table, delighted to screen himself behind the soup-tureen, which
he could just see over, and that was all. The boarders were
seated, a lady and gentleman alternately, like the layers of
bread and meat in a plate of sandwiches; and then Mrs. Tibbs
directed James to take off the covers. Salmon, lobster-sauce,
giblet-soup, and the usual accompaniments were dis-covered:
potatoes like petrifactions, and bits of toasted bread, the shape
and size of blank dice.
" Soup for Mrs. Maplesone, my dear," said the bustling Mrs.
Tibbs. She always called her husband " my dear" before company. Tibbs, who had been eating his bread, and calculating
how long it would be before he should get any fish, helped the
soup in a hurry, made a small island on the table-cloth, and put
his glass upon it, to hide it from his wife.
"Miss Julia, shall I assist you to some fish?"
"If you please-very little--oh! plenty, thank you," (a bit
about the size of a walnut put- upon the plate.)
" Julia is a very little eater," said Mrs. Maplesone to Mr. Calton.
The knocker gave a single rap. He was busy eating fish
with his eyes: so he only ejaculated, "Ah!"
"My dear," said Mrs. Tibbs to her spouse, after every one
else had been helped, "What do you take?"  The inquiry was
accompanied with a look intimating that he musn't say fish, because there was not much left. Tibbs thought the frown referred to the island on the table-cloth; he therefore coolly replied,
"Why-I'll take a little-fish, I think."
" Did you say fish, my dear?" (another frown.)
"Yes, dear," replied the villain, with an expression of acute
hunger depicted in his countenance. The tears almost started
to Mrs. Tibbs' eyes, as she helped her " wretch of a husband,"
as she inwardly called him, to the last eatable bit of salmon on
the dish.
"James take this to your master, and take away your master's knife." This was deliberate revenge, as Tibbs never could
eat fish without one. He was, however, constrained to chase
small particles of salmon round and round his plate with a piece
of bread and a fork, occasionally securing a bit; the number of
successful attempts being about one in seventeen.
174THE BOARDING HOUSE.
175
"Take away, James," said Mrs. Tibbs, just as Tibbs had
swallowed the fourth mouthful-and away went the plates like
lightning.
"I'll take a bit of bread, James," said the poor " master of
the house," more hungry than ever.
"Never mind your master now, James," said Mrs. Tibbs,
"see about the meat." This was conveyed in the tone in
which ladies usually give admonitions to servants in company,
that is to say, a low one; but which, like a stage whisper,
from its peculiar emphasis, is most distinctly heard by every
body present.
A pause ensued before the table was replenished-a sort of
parenthesis in which Mr. Simpson, Mr. Calton and Mr. Hicks
produced respectively a bottle of sauterne, bucellas, and sherry,
and took wine with every body-except Tibbs: no one ever
thought of him.
Between the fish and an intimated sirloin there was a prolonged interval.
Here was an opportunity for Mr. Hicks. He could not resist
the singularly appropriate quotation"But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
Goats' flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton,
And when a holiday upon them smiles,
A. joint upon their barbarous spits they put on."
"Very ungentlemanly behavior," thought little Mrs. Tibbs,
"to talk in that way."
"Ah," said Mr. Calton, filling his glass, " Tom Moore is my
poet."
"And mine," said Mrs. Maplesone.
"And mine," said Miss Julia.
"And mine," added Mr. Simpson.
"Look at his compositions," resumed the knocker.
"To be sure," said Simpson, with confidence.
"Look at Don Juan," replied Mr. Septimus Hicks.
" Julia's letter," suggested Miss Matilda.
"Can anything be grander than the Fire Worshippers?"
inquired Miss Julia.
"To be sure,"' said Simpson.
"Or Paradise and the Peri," said the old beau.
"Yes; or Paradise and the Peer," repeated Mr. Simpson,
who thought he was getting through it capitally.
"It's all very well," replied Mr. Septimus Ilicks, who, as we
have before hinted, never had read anything but Don Juan.THE PiACTICA L ELOCUTIONIST.
"Where will you find anythling finer than the description of the
siege, at the commencement of the seventh canto?"
" Talking of a siege," said Tibbs, with a mouthful of bread"when I was in the volunteer corps, in eighteen hundred and
six, our commanding officer was Sir Charles Rampart; and one
day, when we were exercising on the ground on which the London University now stands, he says, says he, Tibbs (calling me
from the ranks), Tibbs""Tell your master, James," interrupted Mrs. Tibbs, in an
awfully distinct tone, "tell your master if he wont carve those
fowls, to send them to me." The discomfited volunteer instantly
set to work, and carved the fowls almost as expeditiously as his
wife operated on the haunch of mutton. Whether he ever
finished the story is not exactly known, but if he did nobody
heard it.
As the ice was now broken, and the new inmates more at
home, every member of the company felt more at ease. Tibbs
himself most certainly did, because he went to sleep immediately after dinner. Mr. Hicks and the ladies discoursed most
eloquently about poetry, and the theatres, and Lord Chesterfield's Letters; and Mr. Calton followed up what every body
said, with continuous double knocks. Mrs. Tibbs highly approved of every observation that fell from Mrs. Maplesone; and
as Mr. Simpson sat with a smile upon his face and said "Yes,"
or " Certainly," at intervals of about four minutes each, he received full credit for understanding what was going forward.
The gentlemen rejoined the ladies in the drawing-room very
shortly after they had left the dining-parlor. Mrs. Maplesone
and Mr. Calton played cribbage, and the "young people"
amused themselves with music and conversation. The Miss
Maplesones sang the most fascinating duets, and accompanied
themselves on guitars, ornamented with bits of ethereal blue
ribbon. Mr. Simpson put on a pink waistcoat, and said he was
in raptures; and Mr. Hicks felt in the seventh heaven of poetry,
or the seventh canto of Don Juan-it was the same thing to
him. Mrs. Tibbs was quite charmed with the new comers, and
Mr. Tibbs spent the evening in his usual way-he went to sleep,
and woke up, and went to sleep again, and woke at suppertime.
1 76THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF GENIUS.
The Lights and Shadows of Genius.-ORIGINAL.
YOUTH.
CONNECTED as genius is with every great and valuable
acquirement in man, it need not be a matter of surprise
that its possessors should be ranked as the demi-gods of
their age, or that, when pagan darkness overspread the earth,
divine honors should have been awarded to the proud depositories of this faculty! These beacon-lights of the world, elevated above their fellow men, and sublimated by the ethereal
qualities of which they are composed, realize- the creation of
the poet, who, when describing one of the purely imaginative
class, says"He glances from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,
And, as inmagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, his mighty pow'r
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothings
A local habitation and a name!"
Here are the inherent qualities of genius, sketched by a
master hand!    Minds thus endowed appropriate the whole
world and its productions to their particular use; and, entering
into the vast temple of " Nature's God," they penetrate its
recesses, and are initiated into secrets, and develope beauties increation, impervious to inferior minds.  They clothe in the
fervid colors of imagination every scene they witness, every
circumstance by which they are surrounded; and create for
themselves an existence more glorious, more elevated, and more
exquisite, than is allotted to the plain matter-of-fact individual,
who wears out his allotted meed of days in uniform monotony,
uncheered by the illuminations of this splendid but dangerous
gift! Shakspeare has said"Spirits are not finely touch'd,
But to fine issues."
But are the ISSUES of these finely-touched spirits always fine?
Is there not too frequently an accompanying moral shade, over
which humanity weeps, and at which the stern moralist points
the sarcastic finger of scorn?
Let us glance at the Youth of Genius.   It was long the
feeling of antiquity, that the future character of genius
was presaged by its early developments; and the biogra8*

thought, and the whole secret of elocutionary art is comprehended at a glance.
Now this very palpable, practical and easy method, for
acquiring an accomplished and expressive mode of delivery, seems not to require the aid of rules or instructors
to effect, and yet our every-day experience teaches us
that many educated and intelligent persons fail in giving
proper expression to language, when called upon to read or
speak.
Practical experience, I think, has enabled me satisfactorily to solve this apparent anomaly.  The analysis of language, with especial reference to its elocutionary
expression, is seldom thought of. Hence the faulty elocution we so frequently witness, where we might reasonably
look for earnest and impressive delivery; add to this the
defects and mannerisms, natural and acquired, and we
have the key to most of the causes which operate in producing the imperfect and false styles of elocution much
in vogue among us.
We require to be brought back to the great teacher,
NATURE; and we stand in need of capable instructors to
aid us in correcting our defects. There are also certain
essential rules of the art necessary to be known, and there
is labor and practice to be undergone, before we can arrive
at any perfection in the art. It is impossible, in any written system of elocutionary instruction, to convey fully to the
mind of the pupil all the points necessary for his attention.
Even the most elaborate systems of instruction in this art
2TIHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
phy of most men of genius attests the fact.    Intellectual
superiority and precocity of talent are discoverable in the
precincts of the nursery, and ripen and mature in the playground. And yet, with all the bright imaginings of the youthful genius, its hopeful prospects of the future, the rapturous
feelings conveyed to parents' hearts, oh, how closely are the
germs of future woe allied to this period of existence! How
darkly are the shadows of the after life cast over the perspective
vista that opens in mystic dimness before its path! Even then,
when the freshness of the young heart lives almost wholly in
the ideal, when the unchecked aspirations of the youthful mind
revel in visions of pure and holy light, how closely allied is this
dreamy existence to the dull, cold realities which are preparing
by the world to crush the young neophyte's air-built castles
and dispel all his fancied joys! There is something inexpressibly
beautiful in the early developments of the youth of genius.
The reverence for holy influences, which almost invariably
marks the budding child of genius, (it seems instinctive at this
period;) then its lonely musings; its shrinling from the boisterous crowd of young cotemporaries; the contemplative cast
of mind; the early indication of a refined taste; its quickness;
of perception, apparently intuitive; the rapidity with which
difficulties are surmounted; the outstripping of boyish competitors; the proud consciousness of superiority; the supremacy
of mind over matter--how delightful to witness all this! how
triumphant is the joy conveyed to parents and friends! And
yet this picture, breathing as it does with light and purity, is
too often clouded by the darkest shades.
The melancholy temperament engendered by this precocity,
the inaptitude for regular study, and the consequent undisciplined mind thereby produced, are often causes of poignant
sorrow, created by sons--
"Who, doomed a father's hopes to cross,
Oft pen a stanza when they should engross."
Yes, the disobedience of the youth of genius is perhaps among
the most painful shades of its character! Devoted parents have
traced the future course of their child-a bright career of this
world's honor and wealth terminate their hopes; when unexpectedly all these desires are crushed by the erratic and selfwilled propensities of the erring child. The visions of glory
anticipated by the young aspirant are not realized by the
cautious parents; they consider them  but as "idle fancies,"
"unreal mockeries," and thus early are the gloomy shades of
178THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF GENIUS.
disappointment encircled around both parents and children,
which even the future triumphs of genius cannot wholly dispel.
But if, as is too frequently the melancholy case with those of
high poetic tempernment, the parent has to witness the prostration of the bodily powers of the child by indiscretion or the
insidious workings of disease, produced by the overtasking
of the mental powers, until at length the "golden cord is
loosened," and the victim prematurely sinks to an early grave!
THESE, THESE are indeed shadows that surround the youth of
genius, which parents alone can realize, and which paternal
affection can alone portray.
The Lights and Shadows of Genius.-ORIGINAL.
MANHOOD.
IT is in the MANHOOD of Genius, when, by that prerogative
which is its birthright, genius assumes the intellectual nobility
patents cannot confer! It would require a pencil dipped in the
hues of heaven faithfully to portray the LIGHTS reflected by
genius at this stage of its existence!  All knowledge that has
ennobled man, and which has brought him nearer to the Divine
image, has sprung from the CREATIVE POWER of genius in its
ripened manhood. The sciences, mechanics; and the arts have
been perfected by this wondrous faculty, and MAN, gifted by
this emanation of Divinity, has indeed realized the poet's picture"In action like an angel-in apprehension like a god!
The beauty of the world-the paragon of animals!"
Can we imagine a state of feeling more sublimated than that
of the possessor of genius, when its creative power has solved
some hitherto impenetrable phenomenon of Nature, or has perfected some mighty undertaking that ranks the inventor among
the illustrious benefactors of the human race?
Poets and artists, who are the purely imaginative children
of genius, have their triumphs, conferring a mental delight,
surpassing the famed ovations of the Roman conquerors. Those
who are cold and unimaginative smile at the enthusiasm of
genius. But to *the reflective mind it is a subject of pleasing
179THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
analysis, in tracing the biography of genius, that this enthusiasm is frequently its chief support through difficulty, toil, and
neglect. It is this quick sensibility, almost approaching to delirium, that was supposed by Livy to produce the faculty of
enabling the possessor to even " lift the veil of Nature," and
of so cultivating the intellectual powers as to connect man with
the common Master of the universe. It is this peculiar trait in
the character of genius that was denominated the "ideal
presence of things," and has led to the mightiest creations of'
the human mind!
It is this marked characteristic of genius (that enthusiasm
which no difficulties can subdue) that has enabled the renowned
warrior, the profound philosopher, the adept in science, the
wonder-working machinist, the inspired poet, and the supereminent artist to build up their imperishable reputations, and to
become the wonder and envy of their age. And what an intellectual nobility is thus stamped upon the child of true
genius! to which the world involuntarily yields a submissive
homage.
It has been well said, that there are days in the life of genius
that repay its sufferings. As the organ of a nation, nay of the
WORLD-for " no pent-up Utica confines its bounds"--it has the
power of creating and directing the tastes of its fellow men;
receiving, as its' reward, the spontaneous tribute of respect, of
admiration, and of love.
I have thus rapidly sketched the lights beaming around the
path of genius, which are almost without an accompanying
shadow; and, when taken in connection with the veneration that
consecrates even the commonest objects associated with its
memory, may well lead us to exclaim, that this emanation of
Divinity is indeed an enviable gift, elevating, as it does, the
possessor to a pedestal in the Pantheon of this world's gods.
But alas! this picture, so radiant in light, so brilliant in coloring, has its SsIADOWS.
We have already endeavored to depict the possessor of
genius; and although I may be met with the objection that I
have confined myself too exclusively to a delineation of the
poetical character of genius, yet, to such objectors I would
say--Peruse attentively the lives of philosophers, men of science, and great mechanicians, and you will find that, in a comparative degree, occasionally modified by constitutional temperament or by contingent circumstances, the portrait will suit
the "whole tribe."  The possessors of this faculty are imaginative in the highest sense the term is capable of bearing; they
1SOPUBLIC FAITH THE BASIS OF NATIONAL HONOR. 181
revel in the visions of their own creative fancy with unrestrained
indulgence, forming for themselves an existence of their own.
They cannot, during the delirium of enthusiasm, descend to
mix with those grosser materials that compose this every-day
world. They shrink, with fastidious delicacy, from the common
transactions of life; and contract a morbid sensibility of feeling,
an excited irritability of temperament, so at variance with the
equable character necessary for enabling us to maintain our just
position in society, that we need scarcely wonder at the scorn
which the mere matter-of-fact men of the world usually award
to the possessors of genius.
But should this be so?  Should these dark shades overspread
the fair face of genius? Should that faculty which, by common consent, is deemed a particle of the Divine essence-should
it be perverted by the erratic conduct of its possessors, and the
gift become abortive from the inconsistency of. the recipients?
Is it the necessary concomitant of genius to be subjected to the
infirmities it has been my melancholy task to depict? The
answer is, emphatically, NO!!  I would say of genius, in its
extended sense, what a gifted poet has said of poetry:
"It is a glorious gift,
And should be thankfully and nobly used:
Let it look up to Heaven."
This should be the fervent aspiration of genius, and its consciousness of its true position.
"Leave not our course to our unguided will;
Left to ourselves, all crime is possible;
And those who seemed the most removed from guilt,
Have sunk the deepest"
Public Faith the Basis of National Honor,-F. AMEs.
To expatiate on the value of public faith may pass with some
men for declamation; to such men I have nothing to say.  To
others I will urge-can any circumstance mark upon a people
more turpitude and debasement?   Can anything tend more to
make men think themselves mean, or degrade to a lower point
their estimation of virtue and their standard of action?THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
It would not merely demoralize mankind; it tends to break
all the ligaments of society, to dissolve that mysterious charm
which attracts individuals to the nation, and to inspire in its
stead a repulsive sense of shame and disgust.
What is patriotism?  Is it a narrow affection for the spot
where a man was born? Are the very clods where we tread
entitled to this ardent preference because they are greener?
No, sir; this is not the character of the virtue, and it soars
higher for its object. It is an extended self-love, mingling with
all the enjoyments of life, and twisting itself with the minutest
filaments of the heart.  It is thus we obey the laws of society,
because they are the laws of virtue. In their authority we see,
not the array of force and terror, but the venerable image of
our country's honor.  Every good citizen makes that honor his
own, and cherishes it not only as precious, but as sacred. He
is willing to risk his life in its defense, and is conscious that he
gains protection while he gives it. For what rights of a citizen
will be deemed inviolable when a State renounces the principles
that constitute their security?  Or, if his life should not be invaded, what would its enjoyments be in a country odious in the
eyes of strangers and dishonored in his own?  Could he look
with affection and veneration to such a country as his parent?
The sense of having one would die within him; he would blush
for his patriotism, if he retained any, and justly; for it would
be a vice. He would be a banished man in his native land.
Human Progress.-CHAPIN.
LET US clearly understand what is meant by Human Progress.
It must be distinctly separated from the doctrine of Htuman Perfectibility. That men in this world will ever be, in all respects,
perfect, is one doctrine-and that men will pass from lower degrees of excellence up to higherl, and maintain their advantage,
is another doctrine. This last is the doctrine of Human Progress. That our age holds an amount of refinement and civilization that preceding ages did not have, seems evident. We may
not see minutely how this operation of human progress goes on
-we may not be able to trace the transfusion of the good and
the true through every particle and member, But we see the
grand result.
182HUMAN PROGRESS.
So the great ocean comes on imperceptibly. Men build their
huts at the foot of some huge mountain, and till the green fields
that spread out before them-thinking nothing so permanent.
But, by and by, other men come that way, and the green fields
are all gone. The summer fruit has long since been gathered.
Where the husbandman found his wealth, the fisher draws his
support-where the sickles whispered to the bending corn, the
ships of war go sheeting by-and the old mountain has become
a grey and wave-beaten crag, a landmark to the distant mariner, and a turret where the sea-bird screams.
But this was accomplished imperceptibly. One generation may
not have witnessed the advancement of the waters-another
may have passed away without noting it; but slowly they kept
advancing. And by and by, all men saw it-saw the grand
result, though they did not mark each successive operation. So
with human progress. One age may scarcely observe it, and
another may die without faith in it; but we must take some distant period that is not too closely blended with our time, and
compare that with the present, and in the grand result we shall
discover that there has been human progress.
Still, some may say,' Yes, there has been progress, but not
over the whole world-there have been salient points, but also
retreating angles, and when you speak of human progress you
must appeal to the world at large-say, has that advanced?"
I answer, that in the world, somewhere, there has been a constant tendency to advancement. Even the dark times have been
seasons of fruition-the middle ages nourished and prepared
glorious elements of human reformation. If one nation has lost
the thread of human advancement, another has taken it upand so the work has gone forward; if not in the race, as a
whole, at any one time, yet in the race somewhere.
But the race is fundamentally the same, and what may be
predicated of a portion of mankind as belonging essentially to
humanity, may be predicated of the whole; and so in the advancement of a portion of the race, the whole becomes hopeful.
The capacity of the race for progress has been demonstrated.
Is that capacity never to be gratified? Though the period
never has beeli that all the race were at the same time on the
same level, who shall say that the time never will come? that!
it never can come? Who shall say, so long as the capacity
exists, how quick the transfusion of what is excellent in one
portion may be made through the whole?
A victory over the formal Asiatic, grim and bloody as it is,
may be one agent of such transfusion. A triumph of machinery
183THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
may help to accomplish it. The steam-car may carry truth and
light over drifted deserts and frozen mountains. The march of
opinion, aided by circumstances, may penetrate to lands that
never knew the commerce of Phcenicia, or the wisdom of
Athens-where Alexander never ventured with his hosts, and
where Caesar turned back his eagles.
This is the main point-not universal progress, but human
progress-not progress everywhere, but progress somewhere.
Grant but that, and all humanity becomes hopeful-grant but
the capacity, and the doctrine is practicable-let the law be in
operation only at one point, still it is a law, and as such is to be
heeded and acted upon. Old notions may die, but new notions
shall spring up. Let the principle be at work, and no one can
limit the result.
It may take a longer sweep of ages than have yet passed
over mankind, to bring all nations to the same point of advancement; some nations, now here and now there, may always be
in advance of others, yet if the others advance also, the great
law will be in operation. And no people shall have lived or
died in vain. Into the deepest sepulchres of the Old and the
Past a new life shall be kindled, showing that they have not
waited so long for nothing. Dim Meroe will shout freedom
from beyond the fountains of the Nile, and the stony lips of the
Sphinx shall preach the Gospel!
Extension of the Republic.-EDvARD EVERETT.
IN the grand and steady progress of our country, the career
of duty and usefulness will be run by all its children, under a
constantly increasing excitement.  The voice which, in the
morning of life, shall awaken the patriotic sympathy of the land,
will be echoed back by a community, incalculably swelled in all
its proportions, before that voice shall be hushed in death. The
writer, by whom the noble features of our scenery shall be
sketched with a glowing pencil, the traits of our romantic early
history gathered up with filial zeal, and the peculiarities of our
character seized with delicate,perception, cannot mount so entirely and rapidly to success, but that ten years will add new
millions to the numbers of his readers. The American statesman, the orator, whose voice is already heard in its supremacy
from Florida to Maine, whose intellectual empire already ex184EXTENSION OF THE REPUBLIC.
tends beyond the limits of Alexander's, has yet new states and
new nations starting into being, the willing tributaries to his
sway.
The wilderness, which one year is impassable, is traversed
the next by the caravans of the industrious emigrants, who go
to follow the setting sun, with the language, the institutions,
and the arts of civilized life. It is not the irruption of wild
barbarians, sent to visit the wrath of God on a degenerate empire; it is not the inroad of disciplined banditti, marshalled by
the intrigues of ministers and kings. It is the human family,
led out to possess its broad patrimony. The states and nations,
which are springing up in the valley of the Missouri, are bound
to us by the dearest ties of a common language, a common
government, and a comlmon descent.
Who can forget that this extension of our territorial limits is
the extension of the empire of all we hold dear; of our laws,
of our character, of the memory of our ancestors, of the great
achievements in our history? Whithersoever the sons of these
States shall wander, to southern or western climes, they will
send back their hearts to the rocky shores, the battle-fields, and
the intrepid councils of the Atlantic coast. These are placed
beyond the reach of vicissitude. They have become already
matter of history, of poetry, of eloquence:
The love, where death has set his seal,
Nor age can chill, nor rival steal,
Nor falsehood disavow."
We are summoned to new energy and zeal by the high nature
of the experiment we are appointed in Providence to make, and
the grandeur of the theatre on which it is to be performed.
When the Old World afforded no longer any hope, it pleased
Heaven to open this last refuge of humanity. The attempt has
begun, and is going on, far from foreign corruption, on the
broadest scale, and under the most benignant prospects; and it
certainly rests with us to solve the great problem in human
society, to settle, and that for ever, that momentous question-whether mankind can be trusted with a purely popular
system? One might almost think, without extravagance, that
the departed wise and good of all places and times are looking
down from their happy seats to witness what shall now be done
by us; that they who lavished their treasures and their blood
of old, who labored and suffered, who spake and wrote, who
fought and perished, in the one great cause of freedom and
truth, are now hanging, from their orbs on high, over the last

solemn experiment of humanity. As I have wandered over the
spots, once the scene of their labors, and mused among the
prostrate columns of their senate-houses and forums, I have
seemed almost to hear a voice from the tombs of departed ages;
from the sepulchres of the nations which died before the sight.
They exhort us, they adjure us to be faithful to our trust. They
implore us, by the long trials of struggling humanity, by the
blessed memory of the departed; by the dear faith, which has
been plighted, by pure hands, to the holy cause of truth and
man; by the awful secrets of the prison-houses where the sons
of freedom have been immured; by the noble heads which
have been brought to the block; by the wrecks of time, by the
eloquent ruins of nations, they conjure us not to quench the
light which is rising on the world. Greece cries to us, by the
convulsed lips of her poisoned, dying Demosthenes; and Rome
pleads with us, in the mute persuasion of her mangled Tully.

fail to meet all the exigencies that occur in a course of
elocutionary practice; yet most of the essential rules may
be condensed into a brief practical form, capable of affording important aids to any intelligent student. These I have
endeavored to collect into a narrow compass, digested in a
natural order, and trust that they will prove valuable hints
for the direction of the inexperienced and unpractised
student.
ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE,
WTVTH REFERENCE TO ELOCUTIONARY EXPRESSION.
Passing over the grammatical construction of language,
which is more immediately the province of Rhetoric, I
would direct the attention of the pupil to the consideration
that there is " a language of emotions and passions, as
well as a language of ideas," and that this language is
uniformly taught by JN'ature. It is the essential part of
Elocution to imitate this language of nature, in our delivery.  Words and sentences must be analyzed in our
practice, with direct reference to this expression; tones,
looks and gestures must be used in accordance with the
emotions, passions and sentiments we are called upon to
convey. A daily practice of varied selections from standard authors, upon these principles, would alone make a
respectable speaker, for the perceptive faculties would
gradually become quickened, the taste would imperceptixxviTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
But, prithee, tell us something of thyselfReveal the secrets of thy prison-house:Since in the world of spirits thou hast slumbered,
What hast thou seen-what strange adventures numbered?
Since first thy form was in this box extended,
We have, above-ground, seen some strange mutations;
The Roman empire has begun and endedNew worlds have risen-we have lost old nationsAnd countless kings have into dust been humbled,
While not a fragment of thy flesh has crumbled.
Didst thou not hear the pother o'er thy head,
When the great Persian conqueror, Cambyses,
Marched armies o'er thy tomb, with thundering tread,
O'erthrew Osiris, Orus, Apis, IsisAnd shook the pyramids with fear and wonder,
When the gigantic Memnon fell asunder?
If the tomb's secrets may not be confessed,

And tears adown that dusty cheek have rolled:Have children climbed those knees, and kissed that face?

Imperishable type of evanescence!
Posthumous man-who quitt'st thy narrow bed,

Beauty.-RALPE W. EMERSON.
THE presence of a higher, namely, of the spiritual element, is
essential to its perfection. The high and divine beauty which
can be loved without effeminacy, is that which is found in combination with the human will, and never separate. Beauty is
the mark God sets upon virtue. Every natural action is graceful. Every heroic act is also decent, and causes the place and
188the bystanders to shine. We are taught by great actions that
the universe is the property of every individual in it. Every
rational creature has all nature for his dowry and estate. It
is his, if he will. He may divest himself of it; he may creep
into a corner, and abdicate his kingdom, as most men do; but
he is entitled to the world by his constitution. In proportion
to the energy of his thought and will, he takes up the world
into himself. "All those things for which men plough, build,
or sail, obey virtue;" said an ancient historian. " The winds and
waves," said Gibbon, "are always on the side of the ablest
navigators." So are the sun and moon and all the stars of
heaven. When a noble act is done-perchance in a scene
of great natural beauty; when Leonidas and his three hundred martyrs consume one day in dying, and the sun and
moon come each and look at them once in the steep-defile of
Thermopylae; when Arnold Winkelried, in the high Alps,
under the shadow of the avalanche, gathers in his side a
sheaf of Austrian spears to break the line for his comrades;
are not these heroes entitled to add the beauty of the scene
to the beauty of the deed? When the bark of Columbus
nears the shore of America;-before it, the beach lined with
savages, fleeing out of all their huts of cane; the sea behind;
and the purple mountains of the Indian Archipelago around,
can we separate the man from the living picture?  Does not
the New World clothe his form with her palm-groves and savannahs as fit drapery? Ever does natural beauty steal in like
air, and envelope great ac-i,ons. When Sir Harry Vane was
dragged up the Tower-hill, sitting on a sled, to suffer death, as
the champion of the English laws, one of the multitude cried
out to him, " You never sate on so glorious a seat." Charles II.,
to intimidate the citizens of London, caused the patriot Lord
Russel to be drawn in an open coach, through the principal
streets of the city on his way to the scaffold. " But," to use
the simple narrative of his biographer, " the multitude imagined
they saw liberty and virtue sitting by his side." In private
places, among sordid objects, an act of truth or heroism seems
at once to draw to itself the sky as its temple, the sun as its
candle. Nature stretcheth out her arms to embrace man, only
let his thoughts be of equal greatness. Willingly does she follow his steps with the rose and the violet, and bend her lines of
grandeur and grace to the decoration of her darling child. Only
let his thoughts be of equal scope, and the frame will suit the
picture. A virtuous man is in unison with her works, and
makes the central figure of the visible sphere.
BEAUTY.
189riTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST
Science ahtd Literature of America.-JuDGE STORY.
To us, Americans, nothing indeed can or ought to be indifferent, that respects the cause of science and literature. We have
taken a stand among the nations of the earth, and have successfully asserted our claim to political equality. We possess
an enviable elevation, so far as concerns the structure of our
government, our political policy, and the moral energy of our
institutions. If we are not without rivals in these respects, we
are scarcely behind any, even in the general estimate of foreign
nations themselves.  But our claims are far more extensive.
We assert an equality of voice and vote in the republic of
letters, and assume for ourselves the right to decide on the
merits of others, as well as to vindicate our own. These are
lofty pretensions, which are never conceded without proofs, and
are severely scrutinized, and slowly admitted by the grave
judges in the tribunal of letters. We have not placed ourselves
as humble aspirants, seeking our way to higher rewards under
the guardianship of experienced guides.  We ask admission
into the temple of fame, as joint heirs of the inheritance, capable
in the manhood of our strength of maintaining our title. We
contend for prizes with nations whose intellectual glory has received the homage of centuries. France, Italy, Germany, England, can point to the past for monuments of their genius and
skill, and to the present with the undismayed confidence of
veterans. It is not for us to retire from the ground which we
have chosen to occupy, nor to shut our eyes against the difficulties of maintaining it. It is not by a few vain boasts, or
vainer self-complacency, or rash daring, that we are to win our
way to the first literary distinction.  We must do as others
have done before us. We must serve in the hard school of
discipline; we must invigorate our powers by the studies of
other times. We must guide our footsteps by those stars which
have shone, and still continue to shine, with inextinguishable
light in the firmament of learning. Nor have we any reason
for despondency. There is that in American character which
has never yet been found unequal to its purpose. There is that
in American enterprise, which shrinks not, and faints not, and
fails not in its labors. We may say with honest pride"Man is the nobler growth our realms supply,
And souls are ripened in our northern sky."
100ARISTOCRACY.
We may not then shrink from a rigorous examination of our
own deficiencies in science and literature. If we have but a
just sense of our wants, we have gained half the victory. If
we but face our difficulties, they will fly before us. Let us not
discredit our just honors by exaggerating little attainments.
There are those in other countries who can keenly search out,
and boldly expose every false pretension. There are those in
our own country who would scorn a reputation ill founded in
fact, and ill sustained by examples. We have solid claims upon
the affection and respect of mankind. Let us not jeopard them
by a false shame, or an ostentatious pride. The growth of two
hundred years is healthy, lofty, expansive.  The roots have
shot deep and far; the branches are strong and broad. I trust
that many, many centuries to come will witness the increase
and vigor of the stock. Never, never may any of our posterity
have just occasion to speak of our country in the expressiveness of Indian rhetoric--" It is an aged hemlock; it is dead at
the top."
Aristocracy.-MRts. IRKIAND.
THE great ones of the earth might learn many a lesson from
the little. What has a certain dignity on a comparatively large
scale, is so simply laughable when it is seen in miniature, (and,
unlike most other things, perhaps, its real features are better
distinguished in the small,) that it must be wholesome to observe
how what we love appears in those whom we do not admire.
The monkey and the magpie are imitators; and when the one
makes a thousand superfluous bows and grimaces, and the other
hoards what can be of no possible use to him, we may, even in
those, see a far-off reflex of certain things prevalent among ourselves. Next in order come little children; and the boy will put
a napkin about his neck for a cravat, and the girl supply her
ideal of a veil by pinning a pocket-handkerchief to her bonnet,
while we laugh at the self-deception, and fancy that we value
only realities. But what affords us most amusement, is the
awkward attempt of the rustic to c.-py the airs and graces
which have caught his fancy as he saw them exhibited in town;
or, still more naturally, those which have been displayed on
191THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
purpose to dazzle him, during the stay of some " mould of fashion" in the country. How exquisitely funny are his efforts and
their failure! How the true hugs himself in full belief that the
gulf between himself and the pseudo is impassable!  Little
dreams he that his own ill-directed longings after the distingue
in air or in position seem to some more fortunate individual as
far from being accomplished as those of the rustic to himself,
while both, perhaps, owe more to the tailor and milliner than to
any more dignified source.
The country imitates the town most sadly; and it is really
melancholy, to one who loves his kind, to see how obstinately
people will throw away real comforts and advantages in the
vain chase of what does not belong to solitude and freedom.
The restraints necessary to city life are there compensated by
many advantages resulting firom  close contact with others;
while in the country those restraints are simply odious, curtailing the real advantages of the position, yet entirely incapable
of substituting those which belong to, the city.
Real refinement is as possible in the one case as in the other.
Would it were more heartily sought in both!
In the palmy days of alchemy, when the nature and powers
of occult and intangible agents were deemed worthy the study
of princes, the art of sealing hermetically was an essential one;
hence many a precious elixir would necessarily become unmanageable and useless if allowed to wander in the common air.
This art seems now to be among the lost, in spite of the anxious
efforts of cunning projectors; and at the present time a subtle
essence, more volatile than the elixir of life-more valuable than
the philosopher's stone-an invisible and imponderable but most
real agent, long bottled up for the enjoyment of a privileged
few, has burst its bounds and become part of our daily atmosphere. Some mighty sages still contiive to retain within their
own keeping important portions of this tre asure; but there are
regions of the earth where it is open to all, and, in the opinion
of the exclusive, sadly desecrated by having become an object of
pursuit to the vulgar. Where it is still under a degree of control,
the seal of Hermes is variously represented.  In Russia, the supreme will of the autocrat regulates the distribution of the "airy
good:" in other parts of the Continent, ancient prescription has
still the power to keep it within its due reservoirs. In France,
its uses and advantages have been publicly denied and repudiated; yet it is said that practically everybody stands openmouthed where it is known to be floating in the air, hoping to
inhale as much as possible without the odium of seeming to
192grasp at what has been decided to be worthless.  In England
we are told that the precious fluid is still kept with great solicitude in a dingy receptacle called Almack's, watched ever by certain priestesses, who are self-consecrated to an attendance more
onerous than that required for maintaining the Vestal fire, and
who yet receive neither respect nor gratitude for their pains.
Indeed, the fine spirit has become so much diffused in England
that it reminds us of the riddle of Mother GooseA house-full, a hole-full,
But can't catch a bowl-full.
If such efforts in England amuse us, what shall we say of the
agonized pursuit everywhere observable in our own country?
We have denounced the fascinating gas as poisonous-we have
staked our very existence upon excluding it from the land, yet
it is the breath of our nostrils-the soul of our being-the one
thing needful-for which we are willing to expend mind, body,
and estate. We exclaim against its operations in other lands,
but it is the purchaser decrying to others the treasure he would
appropriate to himself. We take much credit to ourselves for
having renounced what all the rest of the world were pursuing,
but our practice is like that of the toper who had forsworn
drink, yet afterward perceiving the contents of a brother sinner's
bottle to be spilt, could not forbear falling on his knees to drink
the liquor from the frozen hoof-prints in the road; or that other
votary of indulgence, who, having once had the courage to pass
a tavern, afterward turned back that he might "treat resolution." We have satisfied our consciences by theory; we feel
no compunction in making our practice just like that of the rest
of the world.
This is true of the country generally; but it is nowhere so
strikingly evident as in these remote regions which the noise of
the great world reaches but at the rebound-as it were in faint
echoes; and these very echoes changed from their original, as
Paddy asserts of those of the Lake of Killarney. It would seem
that our elixir vitce-a strange anomaly-becomes stronger by
dilution. Its power of fascination, at least, increases as it recedes from the fountain head. The Russian noble may refuse
to let his daughter smile upon a suitor whose breast is not covered with orders; the German dignitary may insist on sixteen
quarterings; the well-born Englishman may sigh to be admitted
into a coterie not half as respectable or as elegant as the one

to which he belongs-all this is consistent enough; but we
must laugh when we see the managers of a city ball admit the
daughters of wholesale merchants, while they exclude the families of merchants who sell at retail; and still more when we
come to the "new country," and observe that Mrs. Penniman,
who takes in sewing, utterly refuses to associate with her neighbor Mrs. Clapp, because she goes out sewing by the day; and
that our friend MAr. Diggins, being raised a step in the world by
the last election, signs all his letters of friendship, " D. Diggins,
Sheriff."
Seven Ages of Man.-SHASPEARE.
ALL the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits, and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
And then, the whining school-boy, with his satchel,
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school: And then, the lover;
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow: Then, a soldier;
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous ill honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth: And then, the justice;
In fair round belly, with good capon lined,
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances,
And so he plays his part: The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon;
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble,-pipes
And whistles in his sound: Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
194THE THEATRE.
The Thleatre.-cHANN1NG.
IN its present state, the theatre deserves no encouragement.
In saying this, I do not say that the amusement is radically,
essentially evil. I can conceive of a theatre which would be
the noblest of all amusements and would take a high rank
among the means of refining the taste and elevating the character of a people. The deep woes, the mighty and terrible
passions, and the sublime emotions of genuine tragedy, are
fitted to thrill us with human sympathies, with profound interest
in our nature, with a consciousness of what man can do and
dare and suffer, with an awed feeling of the fearful mysteries
of life. The soul of the spectator is stirred from its depths;
and the lethargy in which so -many live is roused, at least for
a time, to some intenseness of thought and sensibility. The
drama answers a high purpose, when it places us in the presence of the most solemn and striking events of human history,
and lays bare to us the human heart in its most powerful,
appalling, glorious workings. But how little does the theatre
accomplish its end! How often is it disgraced by monstrous
distortions of human nature, and still more disgraced by profaneness, coarseness, indelicacy, and low wit, such as no woman,
worthy of the name, can hear without a blush, and no man can
take pleasure in without self-degradation.  That the theatre
should be suffered to exist in its present degradation is a reproach to the community. Were it to fall, a better drama
might spring up in its place. In the mean time, is there not an
amusement, having an affinity with the drama, which might be
usefully introduced among us?  I mean Recitation. A wo-rk
of genius, recited by a man of fine taste, enthusiasm, and
powers of elocution, is a very pure and high gratification.
Were this art cultivated and encouraged, great numbers, now
insensible to the most beautiful compositions, might be waked
up to their excellence and power. It is not easy to conceive of
a more effectual way of spreading a refined taste through a
community. The drama undoubtedly appeals more strongly to
the passions than recitation; but the latter brings out the meaning of the author more. Shakspeare,.worthily recited, would
be better understood than on the stage. Then, in recitation, we
escape the weariness of listening to poor pelformers, who, after
all, fill up most of the time at the theatre. Recitation, sufficiently varied, so as to include pieces of chaste wit, as well as
of pathos, beauty, and sublimity, is adapted to our present in195THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
tellectual progress, as much as the drama falls below it. Should
this exhibition be introduced among us successfully, the result
would be, that the power of recitation would be extensively
called forth, and this would %'tp added to our social and domestic
pleasures.
American Patriotisrm.-WEBSTER.
WHO is there among us, that, should he find himself on any
spot of the earth where human beings exist, and where the
existence of other nations is known, would not be proud to say,
I am an American?   I am a countryman of Washington? I
am a citizen of that republic which, although it has suddenly
sprung up, yet there are none on the globe who have ears to
hear, and have not heard of it-who have eyes to see, and have
not read of it-who know anything, and yet do not know of its
existence and its glory? And, gentlemen, let me now reverse
the picture. Let me ask, who there is among us, if he were to
be found to-morrow in one of the civilized countries of Europe,
and were there to learn that this goodly form of government
had been overthrown-that the United States were no longer
united-that a death-blow had been struck upon their bond of
union--that they themselves had destroyed their chief good
and their chief honor-who is there whose heart would not sink
within him? Who is there who would not cover his face for
very shame?
At this very moment, gentlemen, our country is a general
refuge for the distressed and the persecuted of other nations.
Whoever is in affliction from political occurrences in his own
country, looks here for shelter.  Whether he be republican,
flying from the oppression of thrones-or whether he be monarch or monarchist, flying from thrones that crumble and fall
under or around him--he feels equal assurance that, if he get
foothold on our soil, his person is safe, and his rights will be
respected.
And who will venture to say that in any government, now
existing in the world, there is greater security for persons or
property than in that of the United States? We have tried
these popular institutions in times of great excitement and commotion; and they have stood substantially firm and steady,
while the fountains of the great political deep have been else196TRIAL OF WARREN HASTINGS.
where broken up; while thrones, resting on ages of prescription, have tottered and fallen; and while, in other countries, the
earthquake of unrestrained popular commotion has swallowed
up all law, and all liberty, and all right together. Our government has been tried in peace, and it has been tried in war; and
has proved itself fit for both. It has been assailed from without, and it has successfully resisted the shock; it has been disturbed within, and it has effectually quieted the disturbance.
It can stand trial-it can' stand assault-it can stand adversity-it can stand everything but the marring of its own
beauty, and the weakening of its own strength. It can stand
everything but the effects of our own rashness and our own
folly. It can stand everything but disorganization, disunion,
and nullification.
Trial of Warren Hastings.-     MAcAuLAY.
THE preparations for the trial had proceeded rapidly;
and on the 13th of February, 1788, the sittings of the court
commenced. There have been spectacles more dazzling to the
eye, more gorgeous with jewelry and cloth of gold, more
attractive to grown-up children, than that which was then
exhibited at Westminster; but, perhaps, there never was a
spectacle so well calculated to strike a highly cultivated, a
a reflecting, an imaginative mind. All the various kinds of interest which belong to the near and to the distant, to the present and to the past, were collected on one spot and in one
hour. All the talents and all the accomplishments which are
developed by liberty and civilization were now displayed, with
every advantage that could be derived both from co-operation
and from contrast. Every step in the proceedings carried the
mind either backward, through many troubled centuries, to the
days when the foundations of the constitution were laid; or far
away, over boundless seas and deserts, to dusky nations living
under strange stars, worshipping strange gods, and writing
strange characters from right to left. The High Court of Parliament was to sit, according to forms handed down from the
days of the Plantagenets, on an Englishman accused of exercising tyranny over the lord of the holy city of Benares, and
the ladies of the princely house of Oude.

bly be cultivated, the vocal organs would assume a capable
and efficient power of modulation and expression, and all
this would be achieved without the aid of elaborated artificial rules, which too frequently level down the minds of
pupils to one Procrustean bed, irrespective of difference of
temperament, habits, or feeling.
I am speaking of the effects this practice may produce
on matured and educated persons; with the young a more
systematic course of instruction must of course be adopted.
In this analytical process the intellectual faculties of the
pupil must never lie dormant.   The meaning and expression of language must be grappled with hooks of steel,
and everyv aid that education can afford must be brought to
bear on our labors; we must understand to feel, and expression will surely follow; and then to acquire a finish
and perfectness of delivery, long, continuous and laborious
practice will be necessary.
The following auxiliary, but subordinate Rules, should
be committed to memory, to assist the pupil in the mere
artistical departments of the study.

The place was worthy of such a trial. It was the great hall
of William Rufus; the hall which had resounded with acclamations at the inauguration of thirty kings; the hall which had
witnessed the just sentence of Bacon and the just absolution of
Somers; the hall where the eloquence of Strafford had for a
moment awed and melted a victorious party inflamed with just
resentment; the hall where Charles had confronted the High
Court of Justice with the placid courage which has half redeemed his fame. Neither military nor civil pomp was wanting.
The avenues were lined with grenadiers. The streets were kept
clear by cavalry. The peers, robed in gold and ermine, were
marshalled by the heralds under Garter King-at-Arms. The
judges, in their vestments of state, attended to give advice on
points of law.  Near a hundred and seventy Lords, threefourths of the Upper House, as the Upper House then was,
walked in solemn order from their usual place of assembling to
the tribunal. The junior baron present led the way-Lord
Heathfield, recently ennobled for his memorable defense of
Gibraltar against the fleets and armies of France and Spatn.
The long procession was closed by the Duke of Norfolk, Earl
Marshal of the realm, by the great dignitaries, and by the
brothers and sons of the king. Last of all came the Prince of
Wales, conspicuous by his fine person and noble bearing. The
gray old walls were hung with scarlet.  The long galleries
were crowded by such an audience as has rarely excited the
fears or the emulation of an orator. There were gathered together, from all parts of a great, free, enlightened, and prosperous realm, grace and female loveliness, wit and learning, the
representatives of every science and of every art.  There were
seated around the queen the fair-haired young daughters of the
house of Brunswick.  There the ambassadors of great kings
and commonwealths gazed with admiration on a spectacle which
no other country in the world could present. There Siddons,
in the prime of her mnajestic beauty, looked with emotion on a
scene surpassing all the imitations of the stage. There the
historian of the Roman Empire thought of the days when
Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily against Verres; and when,
before a senate which had still some show of freedom, Tacitus
thundered against the oppressor of Africa. There were seen,
side by side, the greatest painter and the greatest scholar of the
age. The spectacle had allured Reynolds from that easel which
has preserved to us the thoughtful foreheads of so many writers
and statesmen, and the sweet smiles of so many noble matrons.
It had induced Parr to suspend his labors in that dark and'

profound mine from which he had extracted a vast treasure of
erudition-a treasure too often buried in the earth, too often
paraded with injudicious and inelegant ostentation; but still
precious, massive, and splendid. There appeared the voluptuous charms of her to whom the heir of the throne had in
secret plighted his faith. There, too, was she, the beautiful
mother of a beautiful race, the Saint Cecilia, whose delicate
features, lighted up by love and music, art has rescued from
the common decay.   There were the members of that brilliant
society which quoted, criticised, and exchanged repartees, under
the rich peacock hangings of Mrs. Montague. And there the
ladies, whose lips, more persuasive than those of Fox himself,
had carried the Westminster election against palace and treasury,
shone round Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.
The Sergeants made proclamation. Hastings advanced to the
bar, and bent his knee. The culprit was indeed not unworthy
of that great presence.
The charges, and the answers of Hastings, were first read.
This ceremony occupied two whole days, and was rendered less
tedious than it would otherwise have been, by the silver voice
and just emphasis of Cowper, the clerk of the court, a near
relation of the amiable poet.  On the third day Burke rose.
Four sittings of the court were occupied by his opening speech,
which was intended to be a general introduction to all the
charges. With an exuberance of thought and a splendor of
diction which more than satisfied the highly raised expectation
of the audience, he described the character and institutions of
the natives of India; recounted the circumstances in which the
Asiatic empire of Britain had originated; and set forth the constitution of the Company and of the English Presidencies.
Having thus attempted to communicate to his hearers an idea
of Eastern society, as vivid as that which existed in his own
mind, he proceeded to arraign the administration of Hastings,
as systematically conducted in defiance of morality and public
law. The energy and pathos of the great orator 2xtorted expressions of unwonted admiration even from the st( in and hostile Chancellor; and, for a moment, seemed to pierce even the
resolute heart of the defendant. The ladies in the galleries,
unaccustomed to such displays of eloquence, excited by the
solemnity of the occasion, and perhaps not unwilling to display
their taste and sensibility, were in a state of uncontrollable emotioI'.  Handkerchiefs were pulled out; smelling-bottles were
handed round; hysterical sobs and screams were heard; and
Mrs. Sheridan was carried out in a fit. At length the orator

concluded.   Raising his voice till the old arches of Irish oak
resounded- -" Therefore," said he, " hath it with all confidence
been ordered by the Commons of Great Britain, that I impeach
Warren Hastings of high crimes and misdemeanors.     I impeach
him in the name of the Commons House of Parliament, whose
trust he: has betrayed.    I impeach him in the name of the
English nation, whose ancient honor he has sullied. I impeach
him  in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has
trodden under foot, and whose country he has turned into a
desert.  Lastly, in the name of human nature itself, in the name
of both sexes, in the name of every age, in the name of every
rank, I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all."
God's first Temples.-BaRANT.
THE groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned
To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave,
And spread the roof above them-ere he framed
The lofty vault, to gather and roll back
The sound of anthems-in the darkling wood,
Amidst the cool and silence, he knelt down
And offered to the Mightiest, solemn thanks
And supplication. For his simple heart
Might not resist the sacred influences,
That, from the stilly twilight of the place,
And from the gray old trunks, that, high in heaven,
Mingled their mossy boughs, and from the sound
Of the invisible breath that swayed at once
All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed
His spirit with the thought of boundless power
And inaccessible majesty. Ah, why
Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect
God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore
Only among the crowd, and under roofs
Thit our frail hands have raised! Let me, at least,
Here, in the shadow of this aged wood,
Offer one hymn-thrice happy, if it find
Acceptance in his ear.
Father, thy hand
HIath reared these venerable columns; thou
Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down
Upon the naked earth, and, forthwith, rose
All these fair ranks of trees. They, in thy sun,
Budded, and shook their green leaves in thy breeze,
And shot tcwards heaven. The century-living crow,
200GOD'S FIRST TEMlPLES.
Whose birth was in their fps, grew old and died
Among their branches, till at last they stood,
As now they stand, massy, and tall, and dlark,
Fit shrine for humble worshipper to hold
Communion with his Mlaker. Here are seen
No traces of man's pomp or pride; no silks
Rustle, no jewels shine, nor envious eyes
Encounter; no fantastic carvings show
lThe boast of our vain race to change the form
Of thy fair works. But thou art here-thou fill'st
The solitude. Thou art in the soft winds
That run along the summits of these trees
In music; thou art in the cooler breath,
That, fromn the inmost darkness of the place,
Comes, scarcely felt; the barky trunks, the ground,
The fresh, moist ground, are all instinct with thee.
Here is continual worship; nature, here,
In the tranquillity that thou dost love,
Enjoys thy presence. Noiselessly, around,
From perch to perch, the solitary bird
Passes; and yon clear spring, that,'midst its herbs,
Wells softly for-th, and visits the strong roots
Of half the mighty forests, tells no tale
Of all the good it does. Thou hast not left
Thyself without a witness, in these shades,
Of thy perfections. Grandeur, strength, and grace,
Are here to speak of thee. This mighty oakBy whose immovable stem I stand, and seem
Almost annihilated-not a prince,
In all the proud old world beyond the deep,
E'er wore his crown as loftily as he
Wears the green coronal of leaves with which
Thy hand has graced him. Nestled at his root
Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare
Of the broad sun. That delicate forest flower,
With scented breath, and look so like a smile,
Seems, as it issues fronm the shapeless mould,
An emanation of the indwelling Life,
A visible token of the upholding Love,
That are the soul of this wide universe.
My heart is awed within me, when I thinil
Of the great miracle that still goes on,
In silence, round me-the perpetual work
Of thy creation, finished, yet renewed
Forever. Written on thy works, I read
The lesson of thy own eternity.
Lo! all grow old and die: but see, again,
How, on the faltering footsteps of decay,
Youth presses-ever gay and beautiful youth
In all its beautiful forms. These lofty trees
Wave not less proudly that their ancestors
Moulder beneath them. 0 there is not lost
One of earth's charms: up:- her bosom yet,
9*
201THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
After the flight of untold centuries,
The freshness of her far beginning lies,
And yet shall lie. Life mocks the idle hate
Of his arch enemy Death-yea, seats himself
Upon the sepulchre, and blooms and smiles,
And of the- triumphs of his ghastly foe
Makes his own nourishment. For he came forth
From thine own bosom, and shall have no end.
There have been holy men, who hid themselves
Deep in the woody wilderness, and gave
Their lives to thought and prayer, till they outlived
The generation born with them, nor seemed
Less aged than the hoary trees and rocks
Around them; and there have been holy men,
Who deemed it were not well to pass life thus.
But let me often to these solitudes
Retire, and, in thy presence, reassure
My feeble virtue. Here its enemies,
The passions, at thy plainer footsteps shrink,
And tremblex and are still. 0 God! when thou
Dost scare the world with tempest, set on fire
The heavens with falling thunderbolts, or fill,
With all the waters of the firmament,
The swift, dark whirlwind, that uproots the woods,
And drowns. the villages; when, at thy call,
Uprises the great Deep, and throws himself
Upon the continent, and overwhelms
Its cities; who forgets not, at the sight
Of these tremendous tokens of thy power,
His pride, and lays his strifes and follies by?
Oh, from these sterner aspects of thy face,
Spare me and mine; nor let us need the wrath
Of the mad, unchained elements to teach
Who rules them. Be it ours to meditate,
In these calm shades, thy milder majesty,
And, to the beautiful order of thy works,
Learn to conform the order of our lives.
Vision of Belshazzar.-BYRoN.
THE King was on his throne,
The Satraps thronged the hall I
A thousand bright lamps shone
O'er that high festival.
A thousand cups of gold;
In Judah deemed divineJehovah's vessels hold
The godless Heathen's wine.
202THE ST'UDENT.
In that same hour and hall,
The fingers of a hand
Came forth against the wall,
And wrote as if on sand;
The fingers of a man;A solitary hand
Along the letters ran,
And traced them like a wand.
The monarch saw, and shook,
And bade no more rejoice;
All bloodless waxed his look,
And tremlulous his voice.
"Let the men of lore appear,
The wisest of the earth,
And expound the words of fear,
Which mar our royal mirth."
Chaldea's seers are good,
But here they have no skill;
And the unknown letters stood
Untold and awful still.
And Babel's men of age
Are wise and deep in lore;
But now they were not sage,
They saw-but knew no more.
A captive in the land,
A stranger and a youth,
He heard the king's command,
He saw that writing's truth.
The lamps around were bright,
The prophecy in view;
He read it on that nightThe morrow proved it true.
"Belshazzar's grave is made,
His kingdom passed away,
He, in the balance weighed,
Is light and worthless clay,
The shroud, his robe of state,
His canopy the stone:
The Mede is at his gate!
The Persian on his throne!"

203THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
These volumes, others wrote in wearinessAs I have read them; and this cheek and brow,
Whose ialeness, burned in with heats of thought,
Would make an angel smile, to see how ill
Clay, thrust firom Paradise, consorts with mindIf angels could, like men, smile bitterly!
"Yet must my brow be paler! I have vowed
To clip it with the crown which cannot fade,
When it is faded. Not in- vain ye cry,
Oh! glorious voices, that survive the tongues
From whence was drawn your separate sovereignty
For I would reign beside you! I would melt
The golden treasures of my health and life
Into that name i My lips are vowed apart
From cheerful words--mine ears from pleasant sotlo!
Mine eyes from sights God made so beautifulMy feet from wanderings under shady trees--
Mv hands from clasping of dear-loving friendsMy very heart from feelings which move soft!

And dreams of night!-and when the house is durr.i
In sleep-which is the pause'twixt life and lifeI live and waken thus; and pluck away
Slumber's sleek poppies from my pained lidsGoading my mind, with thongs wrought by herself,
To toil and struggle along this mountain-pathWhich hath no mountain-airs-until she sweat,
Like Adam's brow-and gasp, and rend away,
In agony, her galrment of the flesh!"
And so, his midnight lamp was lit anewAnd burned till morning. But his lamp of life
Till morning burlned not! He was found embraced,
Close, cold and stiff, by death's compelling sleep;
His breast and brow supported on a page
Charkctered over with a praise of fameOf its divineness and beatitudeWords which had often caused that heart to throb,
That cheek to burn; though silent lay they, nowWithout a single beating in the pulse,
And all the fever gone!
I saw a bay
Spring, verdant, from a newly-fashioned grave
The grass upon the grave was verdanterThat being watered by the eyes of One
Who bore not to look up toward the tree!
Others looked on it-soine with passing glance
Because the light wind stirred in its leaves;
And some, with sudden lighting of the soul,
In admiration's ecstasy!-ay! some

PRESIDENT WAYLAND.
OUR object will not have been accomplished till the tomahawk shall be buried for ever, and the tree of peace spread its
broad branches from the Atlantic to the Pacific; until a thousand smiling villages shall be reflected from the waves of the
Missouri, and the distant valleys of the West echo with the song
of the reaper; till the wilderness and the solitary place shall
have been glad for us, and the desert has rejoiced and blossomed as, the rose.
Our labors are not to cease, until the last slave-ship shall have
visited the coast of Africa, and, the nations of Europe and
America having long since redressed her aggravated wrongs,
Ethiopia, from  the Mediterranean to the Cape, shall have
stretched forth her hand unto God.
How changed will then be the face of Asia! Bramins, and
sooders, and castes, and shasters, will have passed away, like
the mist which rolls up the mountain's side before the rising
glories of a summer's morning, while the land on which it
rested, shining forth in all its loveliness, shall, from its numberless habitations, send forth the high praises of God and the
Lamb. The Hindoo mother will gaze upon her infant with the

wounded bosom of his widowed parent the oil of peace and

In a word, point us to the loveliest village that smiles upon a
Scottish or New England landscape, and compare it with the
filthiness and brutality of a Caffrarian kraal, and we tell you,
that our object is to render that Caffrarian kraal as happy and
as gladsome as that Scottish or New England village. Point
us to the spot on the face of the earth, where liberty is best
understood and most perfectly enjoyed, where intellect shoots
forth in its richest luxuriance, and where all the kindlier feelings
of the heart are constantly seen in their most graceful exercise;
point us to the loveliest and happiest neighborhood in the worldl
on which we dwell, and we tell you, that our object is to render
this whole earth, with all its nations, and kindreds, and tongues,
and people, as happy, nay happier than that neighborhood.
We do believe, that God so loved the world, that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life. Our object is to convey to
those who are perishing the news of this salvation.  It is to furnish every family upon the face of the whole earth with the
word of God written in its own language, and to send to every
neighborhood a preacher of the cross of Christ.'Our object
will not be accomplished until every idol temple shall have been
utterly abolished, and a temple of Jehovah erected in its room;
until this earth, instead of being a theatre, on which immortal
beings are preparing by crime for eternal condemnation, shall
become one universal temple, in which the children of men are
learning the anthems of the blessed above, and becoming meet
to join the general assembly and church of the first-born, whose
names are written in heaven: Our design will not bo completed
until
"One song employs all nations, and all cry,'Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain for us;'
The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks
Shout to each other; and the mountain tops
From distant mountains catch the flying joy;
Till, nation after nation taught the strain,
Earth rolls the rapturous hosanna round."
The object of the missionary enterprise embraces every child
of Adam. It is vast as the race to whom its operations are of
necessity limited. It would confer upon every individual on
earth all that intellectual or moral cultivation can bestow. It
would rescue the world from the indignation and wrath, tribula206A YOUTHFUL POET CONTEMPLATING NATURE.                 207
tion and anguish, reserved for every son of man that doeth evil,
and give it a title to glory, honor, and immortality. You see,
then, that our object is, not only to affect every individual of
the species, but to affect him in the momentous extremes of
infinite happiness and infinite woe.  And now we ask, what object ever undertaken by man, can compare with this same desire
of evangelizing the world? Patriotism itself fades away before
it, and acknowledges the supremacy of an enterprise, which
seizes, with so strong a grasp, upon both the temporal and eternal destinies of the whole family of man.
And now, my hearers, deliberately consider the nature of the
missionary enterprise. Reflect upon the dignity of its object;
the high moral and intellectual powers which are to be called
forth in its execution; the simplicity, benevolence, and efficacy
of the means by which all this is to be achieved; and we ask
you, Does not every other enterprise to which man ever put
forth his strength, dwindle into insignificance before that of
preaching Christ crucified to a lost and perishing world?

And ocean's liquid mass, beneath him lay
In gladness and deep joy. The clouds were touched,

District of New York.therefore, occupy much space in this work to the illustration of its principles, farther than to show their practical
application in the acquirement of elocutionary expression.
Articulation is justly considered one of the most indispensable requisites in delivery. A public speaker possessed of only a moderate voice, will not fail to impress an
audience, if he has acquired a correct and distinct articulation.
The chief points to be attended to in the study of this
branch of elocution, are the giving to every letter its due
proportion of sound, and to render a distinct syllabication
of words.
Practice on the prolonged sounds of vowels, vocal consonants and liquids, will be found extremely beneficial to
the elocutionary student. He will acquire ease, force and
precision, and the organs of the voice will also be developed in the course of practice, talking especial care to use
an energetic expulsion of the breath directly from the
chest.*
Pronunciation belongs to this department of Elocution.
Standard authorities must be taken as the recognized guides
in this branch of the art.  Where a choice is left to the
student, I conceive that the public speaker should always
adopt that pronunciation which sounds the most euphonious
on the ear.
* On the maragement of the voice, Dr. Rush, " On the Philosophy of
the Vocal Organs," and Mr. Murdock's " Orthophony; or Vocal Culture
in Elocution," may be consulted as standard authorities.
INTRODUCTION.
XXVlllTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Such inteircourse was his, and in this sort
Was his existence oftentimes possessed.
Oh then how beautiful, how bright appeared
The written promise! Early had he learned
To reverence the volume that displays
The mystery, the life which cannot die;
But in the mountains did he frel his faith.
All things, responsive to the writing, there
Breathed immortality, revolving life,
And greatness still revolving; infinite;
There littleness was not; the least of things
Seemed infinite; and then his spirit shaped
Her prospects, nor did he believe-he saw.
What wonder if his being thus became
Sublime and comprehensive i Low desires,
Low thoughts had there no place; yet was his heart
Lowly; for he was meek in gratitude,
Oft as he called those ecstasies to mind,
And whence they flowed; and from them he acquired
Wisdom, which works through patience; thence he learned,
In oft-recurring hours of sober thought,
To look on nature with an humble heart,
Self-questioned where it did not understand,
And with a superstitious eye of love.
The Passions.-COLLINs.
WHEN Music, heavenly maid, was young,
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Thronged around her magic cell;
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possessed beyond the Muse's painting.
By turns, they felt the glowing mind
Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined:
Till once,'tis said, when all were fired,
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,
From the supporting myltles round
They snatched her instruments of sound;
And, as they oft had heard apart,
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,
Each-for Madness ruled the hourWould prove his own expressive power.
First, Fear, his hand, its skill to try,
Amid thle chords bewildered laid;
And back recoiled, he knew not why,
Even at the sound himself had made.
208THE PASSIONS.
Next, Anger rushed, his eyes on fire,
In lightnings owned his secret stings:
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept, with hurried hands, the strings.
With woful measures, wan DespairLow sullen sounds!-his grief beguiled;
A solemn, strange, and mingled air;'Twas sad, by fits-by starts,'twas wild.
But thou, 0 Hope! with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure!
Still it whispered promised pleasure,
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail.
Still would her touch the strain prolong;
And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,
She called on Echo still through all her song.
And, where her sweetest theme she chose,
A soft responsive voice was heard at every close;
And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair
And longer had she sung-but with a frown,
Revenge impatient rose.
He tthrew his blood-stained sword in thunder down;
And, with a withering look,
The war-denouncing trumpet took,
And blew a blast, so loud and dread,
Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe;
And, ever and anon, he beat
The doubling drum with furious heat.
And though, sometimes, each dreary pause between,
Dejected Pity, at his side,
Her soul-subduing voice applied,
Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien;
While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.
Thy numbers, Jealousy, to naught were fixed;
Sad proof of thy distressful state!
Of differing themes the veering song was mixed:
And, now, it courted Love; now, raving called on Hate.
With eyes upraised, as one inspired,.Pale Melancholy sat retired;
And, from her wild sequestered seat,
In notes by distance made more sweet,
Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul:
And, dashing soft, from rocks around,
Bubbling runnels joined the sound.
Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole;
Or o'er some haunted streams, with fond delayRound a holy calm diffusing,
Love of peace and lonely musingIn hollow murmurs died away.
209TEIE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
But, oh, how altered was its sprightlier tone!
When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,
Her bow across her shoulders flung,
Her buskins gemmed with morning dew,
Blew an inspiring air, that dale and thicket rung;
The hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known!
The oak-crowned sisters, and their chaste-eyed queen,
Satyrs, and sylvan boys, were seen,
Peeping from forth their alleys green;
Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear;
And Sport leaped up, and seized his beechen spear.
Last, came Joy's ecstatic trial.
He, with viny crown advancing,
First to the lively pipe his hand addressed;
But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol,
Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best.
They would have thought, who heard the strain,
They saw, in Tempe's vale, her native maids,
Amid the festal-sounding shades,
To some unwearied minstrel dancing;
While, as his flying fingers kissed the strings,
Love framed with iMirth a gay fantastic roundLoose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound;
And he, amid his frolic play,
As if he would the charming air repay,
Shook thousand odors from his dewy wings.
Alaric    the  Visigoth.-EDWARD EVERETT.
Alaric stormed and spoiled the city of Rome, and was afterwards buried in the channel of the
river Busentius, the water of which had been diverted from its course that the body might
be interred.
WHEN I am dead, no pageant train
Shall waste their sorrows at my bier,
Nor worthless pomp of homage vain
Stain: itwith hypocritic tear;
For I will die as I did live,
Nor take the boon I cannot give.
Ye shall not raise a marble bust
Upon the spot where I repose;
Ye shall not fawn before my dust,
In hollow circumstance of woes;
Nor sculptured clay, with lying breath,
Insult the clay that moulds beneath.
210ALARIC THE VISIGOTIH.
Ye shall. not pile, with servile toil,
Your monuments upon my breast,
Nor yet within the common soil
Lay down the wreck of power to rest;
Where man can boast that he has trod
On him that was " the scourge of God."
But ye the mountain stream shall turn,
And lay its secret channel bare,
And hollow, for your sovereign's urn,
A resting-place for ever there:
Then bid its everlasting springs
Flow back upon the king of kings;
And never be the secret said,
Until the deep give up his dead.
My gold and silver ye shall fling
Back to the clods, that gave them birth;
The captured crowns of many a king,
The ransom of a conquered earth:
For, e'en though dead, will I control
The trophies of the capitol.
But when, beneath the mountain tide,
Ye've laid your monarch down to rot,
Ye shall not rear upon its side
Pillar or mound to mark the spot;
For long enough the world has shook
Beneath the terrors of my look;
And, now that I have run my race,
The astonished realms shall rest a space.
My course was like a river deep,
And from the northern hills I burst,
Across the world, in wrath to sweep,
And where I went the spot was cursed,
Nor blade of grass again was seen
Where Alaric and his hosts had been.
See how their haughty barriers fail
Beneath the terror of the Goth,
Their iron-breasted legions quail
Before my ruthless sabaoth,
And low the queen of empires kneels,
And grovels at my chariot-wheels.
Not for myself did I ascend
In judgment my triumphal car;'Twas God alone on high did send
The avenging Scythian to the war,
To shake abroad, with iron hand,
The appointed scourge of his command.
211THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
With iron hand that scourge I reared
O'er guilty king and guilty realm;
Destruction was the ship I steered,
And vengeance sat upon the helm,
When, launched in fury on the flood,
I ploughed my way through seas of blood,
And, in the stream their hearts had spilt,
Washed out the long arrears of guilt.
Across the everlasting Alp
I poured the torrent of my powers,
And feeble Caesars shrieked for help,
In vain, within their seven-hilled towers.
I quenched in blood the brightest gem
That glittered in their diadem,
And struck a darker, deeper die
In the purple of their majesty,
And bade my northern banners shine
Upon the conquered Palatine.
My course is run, my errand done;
I go to Him from whom I came;
But never yet shall set the sun
Of glory that adorns my name;
And Roman hearts shall long be sick,'When men shall think of Alaric.
My course is run, my errand done;
But darker ministers of fate,
Impatient, round the eternal throne,
And in the caves of vengeance, wait;
And soon mankind shall blench away
Before the name of Attila.

Pour out this pride of opinion on the altar of patriotism. Let
it it be an expiatory libation for the weal of America. Do not,
for God's sake, do not suffer that pride to plunge us all into the
abyss of ruin. Indeed, indeed, it will be but of little, very little
avail, whether one opinion or the other be right or wrong; it
will heal no wounds; it will pay no debts; it will rebuild no
ravaged towns. Do not rely on:that popular will, which has
brought us frail beings into political existence. That opinion is

harmony, the existence of our nation to the wild wind. Trust
not your treasure to the waves. Throw not your compass and

not away this only anchor of our safety. I have seen its progress. I know the difficulties through which it was obtained.

and I declare to you, that if you lose this charter, never! no,
never will you get another!  We are now, perhaps, arrived
at the parting point. Here, even here, we stand on the brink
of fate. Pause-pause--for Heaven's sake, pause!!
The Future Destiny of America.-G. S. HIILLARD.
WE may betray the trust reposed in us-we may most miserably defeat the fond hopes entertained of us. We may become
the scorn of tyrants and the jest of slaves. From our fate,
oppression may assume a bolder front of insolence, and its victims sink into a darker despair.
In that event, how unspeakable will be our disgrace-with
what weight of mountains will the infamy lie upon our souls!
The gulf of our ruin will be: as deep, as the elevation we might
have attained is high. How wilt thou fall from heaven, O
Lucifer, son of the morning! Our beloved country with ashes
for beauty, the golden cord of our union broken, its scattered
fragments presenting every form of misrule, from the wildest
213TH'IE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
anarchy to the most ruthless despotism, our "soil drenched
with fraternal blood," the life of man stripped of its grace and
dignity, the prizes of honor gone, and virtue divorced from half
its encouragements and supports--these are gloomy pictures,
which I would not invite your imaginations to dwell upon, but
only to glance at, for the sake of the warning lessons we may
draw from them.
Remember that we can have none of those consolations which
sustain the patriot who mourns over the undeserved misfortunes
of his country. Our Rome cannot fall, and we be innocent.
No conqueror will chain us to the car of his triumph--no countless swarm of Huns and Goths will bury the memorials and
trophies of civilized life beneath a living tide of barbarism.
Our own sejfishness, our own neglect, our own passions, and our
own vices will furnish the elements of our destruction. With
our own hands we shall tear down the stately edifice of our
glory. We shall die by self-inflicted wounds.
But we will not talk of themes like these. We will not think
of failure, dishonor, and despair. We will elevate our minds to
the contemplation of our high duties, and the great trust committed to us. We will resolve to lay the foundations of our
prosperity on that rock of private virtue, which cannot be
shaken until the laws of the moral world are reversed. From
our own breasts shall flow the salient springs of national increase. Then our success, our happiness, our glory is inevitable.
We may calmly smile at all the croakings of all the ravens,
whether of native or foreign breed.
The whole will not grow weak by the increase of its parts.
Our growth will be like that of the mountain oak, which strikes
its roots more deeply into the soil, and clings to it with a closer
grasp, as its lofty head is exalted and its broad arms stretched
out. The loud burst of joy and gratitude which this, the anniversary of our independence, is breaking from the full hearts
of a mighty people, will never cease to be heard. No chasms
of sullen silence will interrupt its course-no discordant notes
of sectional madness mar the general harmony. Year after
year will increase it, by tributes from now unpeopled solitudes.
The farthest West shall hearl it and rejoice-the Oregon shall
swell it with the voice of its waters-the Rocky Mountains
shall fling back the glad sound from their snowy crests.
214LAZY PEOPLE.
Lazy People.--MRs. KIRLAND.
You may see him, if you are an early riser, setting off, at
peep of dawn, on a fishing expedition. He winds through the
dreary woods, yawning portentously, and stretching as if he
were emulous of the height of the hickory trees. Dextrously
swaying his long rod, he follows the little stream till it is lost in
the bosom of the woodland lake; if unsuccessful from the bank,
he seeks the frail skiff, which is the common property of laborious idlers like himself, and, pushing off shore, sits dreaming
under the sun's wilting beams, until he has secured a supply
for the day. Home again-an irregular meal at any time of
day-and he goes to bed with the ague; but he murmurs not,
for fishing is not work...
Then come the whortleberries; not the little, stunted, seedy
things that grow on dry uplands and sandy commons; but the
produce of towering bushes in the plashy meadow; generous,
pulpy berries, covered with a fine bloom; the "blae-berry" of
Scotland; a delicious fruit, though of humble reputation, and,
it must be confessed, somewhat enhanced in value by the
scarcity of the more refined productions of the garden. We
scorn thee not, oh! bloom-covered neighbor! but gladly buy
whole bushels of thy prolific family from the lounging Indian, or
the still lazier white nlian. We must not condemn the gatherers
of whortleberries, but it is a melancholy truth that they do not
get rich.....
Baiting for wild bees beguiles the busy summer of work into
many a wearisome tramp, mahy a night-watch, and many a lost
day. This is a most fascinating chase, and sometimes excites
the very spirit of gambling. The stake seems so small in comparison with the possible prize-and gamblers and honey-seekers
think all possible things probable-that some, who are scarcely
ever tempted friom regular business by any other disguise of
idleness, cannot withstand a bee-hunt. A man whose arms and
axe are all-sufficient to insure a comfortable livelihood for himself and his family, is chopping, perhaps, in a thick wood, where
the voices of the locust, the cricket, the grasshopper, and the
wild bee, with their kindred, are the only sounds that reach his
ear from sunrise till sunset. He feels lonely and listless; and
as noon draws on, he ceases from his hot toil, and, seating himself on the tree which has just fallen beneath his axe, he takes
out his lunch of bread and butter, and, musing as he eats, thinks
how hard his life is, and how much better it must be to have
215THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
bread and butter without working for it. His eye wanders
through the thick forest, and follows, with a feeling of envy, the
winged inhabitants of the trees and flowers, till at length he
notes among the singing throng some half dozen of bees.
The lunch is soon dispatched; a honey tree must be near;
and the chopper spends the remainder of the daylight in endeavoring to discover it. But the cunning insects scent the human robber, and will not approach their home until nightfall.
So our weary wight plods homeward laying plans for their
destruction.
The next morning's sun, as he peeps above the horizon, finds
the bee-hunter burning honey-comb and old honey near the
scene of yesterday's inkling. Stealthily does he watch his line
of bait, and cautiously does he wait until the first glutton that
finds himself sated with the luscious feast sets off in a "beeline"--"like arrow darting from the bow"-blind betrayer of
his home, like the human inebriate. This is enough. The
spoiler asks no more; and the first moonlight night sees the
rich hoard transferred to his cottage; where it sometimes serves,
almost unaided, as food for the whole family, until the last drop
is consumed, One hundred and fifty pounds of honey are
sometimes found in a single tree, and it must be owned the
temptation is great; but the luxury is generally dearly purchased, if the whole cost and consequences be counted. To be
content with what supplies the wants of the body for the present moment, is, after all, the characteristic rather of the brute
than of the man; and a family accustomed to this view of life
will grow more and more idle and thriftless, until poverty and
filth and even beggary lose all their terrors.  It is almost
proverbial among farmers that bee-hunters are always behindhand.
Quarrel of Brutus and Cassius.-S      HAKSPEARE.
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS.
C(as. That you have wronged me, doth appear in this:
You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella,
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein, my letters, praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
216QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS.
Bru. You wronged yourself, to write in such a case.
Cas. In such a time as this, it is not meet
That every nice offense should bear his comment.
Bru. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemned to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold,
To undeservers.
Cas. I an itching palm?
You know, that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
Bru. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
CGas. Chastisement!
Bru. Remember March, the ides of March remember I
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touched his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
rhat struck the foremost man of all this world,
But for supporting robbers; shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?
And sell tlhe mighty space of our large honors,
For so much trash, as may be grasped thus?I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
Cas. Brutus, bay not me,
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions.
Bru. Go to; you're not, Cassius.
Gas. I am.
Bru. I say you are not.
Gas. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Have mird upon your health, tempt me no further.
Bru. Away, slight man!
Cas. Is't possible?
Bru. Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash choler  
Shall I be frighted, when a madman stares?
Cas. 0 ye gods! ye gods! Must I endure all this?
Bru. All this? ay, more: Fret till your proud heart break;
Go, show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humor? By the gods,
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.

217INTRODUCTION.
INFLECTION.' Inflection is simply a bending or sliding of the voice
upwards or downwards.    There are two inflections; the
one called the Upward, or Rising Inflection; the other, the
Downward, or Falling Inflection."
Unimportant as this branch of the art may at first appear,
it is nevertheless essentially necessary to be thoroughly understood, connected as it is with the use of pauses, and
being also one of the means whereby we convey to the
hearer a distinct perception of the construction and meaning of language.
Inflection, in its positive sense, shows by the rising inflection, that the sense or meaning of the sentence is suspended; and by the falling inflection, that the sense is
completed, as
Age,' that lessens the enjoyment of life,' increases our desire
of living.'
In a series of particulars, the rising inflection is used
until the final clause of the series-when the falling indicates the close.
When a series begins a sentence, but does not end it,
this rule is broken; the last clause of the series then takes
the suspending pause, with a greater degree of inflection,
as for example:
Finally,' brethren,' whatsoever things are true,' whatsoever

And it shall please me well: For mine own part
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
Cas. You wrong me every way; you wronong me, Brutus;
I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
Did I say, better?
Brun. If you did, I care not.
Cas. W hen Cesar lived he durst not thus have moved me.
Bru. Peace, peace; you durst not so have tempted him.
Cas. I durst not?
B2'zt. No.
Cas. What? durst not tempt him?
Bru. For your life you durst not.
Cas. Do not presume too much upon my love,
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
Bru. You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats:
For I am armled so strong in honesty,
That they pass by me, as the idle wind,
TVhich I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied, me;
For I can:raise no money by vile means:
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash,
By any indirection. I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied sne: Was that done like Cassius?
Should I lhave answered Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
Dash hiin to pieces!
Cas. I denied you not.
Bru. You did.
Cas. I did not: he was but a fool,
That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart
A friend shlould bear his friend's infirmities,
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
Brst. I do not, till you practise them on me.
('as. You love nme not.
Bru. I do lnot like your faults.
Cas. A fiiendly eye could never see such faults.
Bru. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus.
Cas. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
Revenge yolurselves alone on Cassius i
For Cassius is aweary of the world:
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother:
Checked like a bondman; all his faults observed,
Set in a note-book, learned, and conned by rote,
To cast unto my teeth. 0, I could weep
My sp:rit from mine eyes!-There is my dagger,
218DAMON AND PYTHIAS.
And bere my naked breast; within, a heart
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
Strike, as thou didst at Cesar; for, I know,
When thou didst hate him worse, thou lov'dst him better
Than ever thou lov'dst Cassius.
Bru. Sheath your dagger:
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
0 Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger, as the flint bears fire;
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
And stright is cold again.
Cas. Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
When grief, and blood ill-tempered, vexeth him?
Brit. When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.
Gas. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
Bru. And my heart too.
Gas. 0 Brutus!Bru. What's the matter?
Cas. Have you not love enough to bear with me,
When that rash humlor, which my mother gave me,
Makes me forgetful?
Brz. Yes, Cassius; and, henceforth,
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you.
Damon and PytAias.-WILLAMP PETER.
"H ERE, guards!" pale with fears Dionysius cries,
"Here, guards, yon intruder arrest!'Tis Damon-but hah! speak, what means this disguise?
And the dagger, which gleams in thy vest?"
"'Twas to free," says the youth, " this dear land from its chains I"
"' Free the land! wretched fool, thou shall die for thy pains."
"I am ready to die-I ask not to liveYet three days of respite, perhaps, thou may'st give,
For to-morrow, nmy sister will wed,
And'twould damp all her jov, were her brother not there;
Then let me, I pray, to her nuptials repair,
Whilst a friend remains here in my stead."
With a sneer on his brow, and a curse in his breast,
"Thou shalt have," cries the tyrant, " shalt have thy request
To thy sister's repair, on her nuptials attend,
9t19220            T1-UTE PiIAC'iCAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Enjoy thy three days, but--mark well what I sayReturn on the third; if, beyond that fixed day,
There be but one hour's, but one moment's delay,
That delay shall be death to thy friend!"
Then to Pythias he went; and he told him his case:
That true fiiend answered not, but, with instant embrace
Consenting, rushed forth to be bound in his room;
And now, as if winged with new life from above,
To his sister he flew, did his errand of love,
And, ere a third morning had brightened the grove,
Was returnling with joy to his doom.
But the heavens interpose,
Stern the tempest arose,
And, when the poor pilgrim arrived at the shore,
Swollen to torrents, the rills
Rushed in foam from the hills,
And crash went the bridge in the whirlpool's wild roar.
Wildly gazing, despairing, half phrensied he stood;
Dark, dark were the skies, and dark was the flood,
And still darker Ihis loin heart's emotion;
And he shouted for aid, but no aid was at hand,
No boat ventured forth from the surf-ridden strand,
And the waves sprang, like woods, o'er the lessening land,
And the stream was becoming an ocean.
Now with knees low to earth and with hands to the skies,
"Still the storm, God of might, God of mercy 1" he cries" Oh hush with thy breath this loud sea;
The hours hurry by; the sun glows on high;
And should he go down, and I reach not yon town,
MVy friend-he must perish for me!"
Yet the wrath of the torrent still went on increasing,
And waves upon waves still dissolved without ceasing,
And hour after hour hurried on;
Then, by anguish impelled, hope and fear alike o'er,
He, reckless, rushed into the water's deep roar;
Rose, sunk, struggled on, till, at length, the wished shoreThanks to Heaven's outstretched hand-it is won!But new perils await him: scarce'scaped from the flood,
And intent on redeeming each moment's delay,
As onward he sped, lo! from out a dark wood,
A band of fierce robbers encompassed his way.
"What would ye?" he cried, " save my life I have naught;
Nay, that is the king's"-Then swift, having caught
A club from the nearest, and swinging it round
With might more than man's, he laid three on the ground,
Whilst the rest hurried off in dismay.
But the noon's scorching flame
Soon shoots through his frame,
And he turns, faint and way-worn, to hleaven with a sighDAMON' AND PYTHIAS.
" From the flood and the foe
Thou'st redeemed me, and oh!
Thus, by thirst overcome, must I effortless lie,
And leave him, the beloved of my bosom, to die I"
Scarce uttered the word,
When startled he heard
Purling sounds, sweet as silver's, fall fresh on his ear,
And low a small rill
Trickled down frorn the hill!
He heard and he saw, and, with joy drawing near,
Laved his limbs, slaked his thirst, and renewed his career.
And now the sun's beams through the deep boughs are glowing,
And rock, tree, and mountain their shadows are throwing,
Huge and grim, o'er the meadow's bright blooinm;
And two travellers are seen coming forth on their way,
And, just as they pass, he hears one of them say"'Tis the hour that was fixed for his doom."
Still, anguish gives strength to his wavering flight;
On he speeds; and lo now! in eve's reddening light
The domes of far Syracuse blend;
There Philostratus meets him, (a servant grown gray
In his house,) crying: " Back! not a moment's delay;
No cares will avail for thy friend.
"No; nothing can save his dear head from the tomb;
So think of preserving thine own.
Myself,:I beheld him led forth to his doom;
Ere this, his brave spirit has flown.
With confident soul he stood, hour after hour,
Thy return never doubting to see;
No sneers of the tyrant that faith could o'erpower,
Or shake his assurance in thee!"
"And is it too late? anu cannot I save
His dear life? then, at least, let me share in his grave I
Yes, death shall unite us! no tyrant shall say,
That friend to his friend proved untrue; he may slay,
May torture, may mock at all mercy and ruth,
But ne'er shall he doubt of our friendship and truth."'Tis sunset; and Damon arrives at the gate,
Sees the scaffold, and multitudes gazing below;
Already the victim is bared for his fate,
Already the deathsman stands armed for the blow;
When hark! a wild voice, which is echoed around,
"Stay!-'tis I-it is Damon, for whom he was bound 1"
And now they sink into each other's embrace,
And are weeping for joy and despair.
Not a soul, amongst thousands, but melts at their case;
Which swift to the monarch they bear;
221THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Even he, tdo, is moved-feels for once as he oughtAnd commands, that they both to his throne shall be brought.
Then-alternately gazing on each gallant youth
With looks of awe, wonder, and shame"Ye have conquered," he cries. " Yes, I see now that truth,
That friendship, is not a mere name.
Go: you're free; but, whilst life's dearest blessings you prove,
Let one prayer of your monarch be heard,
That-his past sins forgot-in this union of love
And of virtue-you make him the third."
Adventure.-TUPPEr.
How gladly would I wander through some strange and savage land,
The lasso at Iny saddle-bow, the rifle in my hand,
A leash of gallant mastiffs bounding by my side,
And for a friend to love, the noble horse on which I ride!
Alone, alone-yet not alone, for God is with me there,
The tender hand of Providence shall guide me everywhere,
While happy thoughts and holy hopes, as spirits calm and mild,
Shall fan with their sweet wings the hermit-hunter of the wild!
Without a guide-yet guided well-young, buoyant, fresh, and free,
Without a road-yet all the land a highway unto meWithout a care, without a fear, without a grief or pain,
Exultingly I thread the woods, or gallop o'er the plain I
Or, brushing through the copse, from his leafy home I start
The stately elk, or tusky boar, the bison or the hart,
And then-with eager spur, to scour away, away!
Nor stop-until my dogs have brought the glorious brute to bay.
Or, if the gang of hungry wolves come yelling on my track,
I make my ready rifle speak, and scare the cowards back;
Or, if the lurking leopard's eyes among the branches shine,
A touch upon the trigger-and his spotted skin is mine I
And then the hunter's savory fare at tranquil eventideThe dappled deer I shot to-day upon the green hillside;
My feasted hounds are slumbering round beside the water-course,
And plenty of sweet prairie-grass for thee, my nloble horse.
Hist! hist! I heard some prowler snarling in the wood;
I seized my knife and trusty gun, and face to face we stood I
The Grizzly Bear came rushing on-and, as he rushed, he fell!

T'he Freedom     of the Press.-JUDGE STORY.
ONE of the most striking characteristics of our age, and that
indeed which has worked deepest in all the changes of its fortunes and pursuits, is the general diffusion of knowledge. This
is emphatically the age of reading.   In other times, this was
the privilege of the few; in ours, it is the possession of the
many. Learning once constituted the accomplishment of those
in the higher orders of society, who had no relish for active
employment, and of those whose monastic lives and religious
profession sought to escape from the weariness of their common
duties. Its progress may be said to have been gradually downwarlds from the higher to the middle classes of society. It
scarcely reached at all, in its joys or its sorrows, in its instructions or its fantasies, the home of the peasant and artisan.  It
now radiates in all directions, and exerts its central force more
in the middle than in any other class of society. The means
of education were formerly within the reach of few. It required
wealth to accumulate knowledge. The possession of a library
was no ordinary achievementq The learned leisure of a fellowship in some university seemed almost indispensable for any
successful studies; and the patronage of princes and courtiers
was the narrow avenue of public favor. I speak of a period at
little more than the distance of two centuries; not of particular
instances, but of the general cast and complexion of life.
The principal cause of this change is to be found in the freedom of the press, or rather in co-operating with the cheapness
223THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
of the press. It has been aided, also, by the system of free
schools wherever it has been established; by that liberal commerce which connects, by golden chains, the interests of mankind; by that spirit of inquiry which Protestantism awakened
throughout Christian Europe; and, above all, by those necessities which have compelled even absolute monarchs to appeal to
the patriotism and common sentiments of their subjects. Little
more than a century has elapsed since the press, in England,
was under the control of a licenser; and within our own days
only has it ceased to be a contempt, punishable by imprisonment, to print the debates of Parliament. We all know how it
still is on the continent of Europe. It either speaks in timid
undertones, or echoes back the prescribed formularies of the
government.  The moment publicity is given to the affairs of
state, they excite everywhere an irresistible interest. If discussion be permitted, it will soon be necessary to enlist talents to
defend, as well as talents to devise, measures. The daily press
first instructed men in their wants, and soon found that the
eagerness of curiosity outstripped the power of gratifying it.
No man can now doubt the fact that, wherever the press is free,
it will emancipate the people; wherever knowledge circulates
unrestrained, it is no longer safe to oppress; wherever public
opinion is enlightened, it nourishes an independent, masculine,
and healthful spirit. If Faustus were now living, he might exclaim, with all the enthusiasm  of Archimedes, and with a far
nearer approach to the truth, Give me where I may place a
free press, and I will shake the world.
Highland    Snow-Storm.-PROFESOR WILSON.
THESE huts belonged to brothers; and each had an only
child, a son and a daughter, born on the same day, and now
blooming on the verge of youth. *A year ago, and they were
but mere children; but what wondrous growth of frame and
spirit does nature at that season of life often present before our
eyes! So that we almost see the very change going on between
morn and morn, and feel that these objects of our affection are
daily brought closer to ourselves, by partaking daily more and
more in all our most sacred thoughts, in our cares and in our
duties, and in knowledge of the sorrows as well as the joys of
224HIGHLAND SNOW-STORM.
our common lot. Thus had these cousins grown up before their
parents' eyes; Flora Macdonald-a name hallowed of yorethe fairest, and Ranald Cameron, the boldest of all the living
flowers' in Glenco and Glencreran. It was now their seventeenth birthday, and never had a winter sun smiled more
serenely over a hush of snow. Flora, it had been agreed on,
was to pass that day in Glencreran, and Ranald to meet her
among the mountains, that he might bring her down the many
precipitous passes to his parent's hut. It was the middle of
February, and the snow had lain for weeks with all its drifts
unchanged, so. calm had been the weather, and so continued the
frost. At the same hour, known by horologe on the cliff
touched by the finger of dawn, the happy creatures left each
their own glen, and mile after mile of the smooth surface glided
away past their feet, almost as the quiet water glides by the
little boat that in favoring breezes walks merrily along the sea.
And soon they met at the trysting-place-a bank of birch-trees
beneath a cliff that takes its name from the Eagles.
On their meeting, seemed not to them the whole of nature
suddenly inspired with joy and beauty?  Insects unheard by
them before, hummed and glittered in the air; from tree-roots,
where the snow was thin, little flowers, or herbs flower-like, now
for the first time were seen looking out as if alive; the trees
themselves seemed budding as if it were already spring; and
rare as in that rocky region are the birds of song, a faint trill
for a moment touched their ears, and the flutter of a wing, telling them that somewhere near there was preparation for a nest.
Deep down beneath the snow they listened to the tinkle of rills
unreached by the frost; and merry, tlhought they, was the
music of these contented prisoners. Not summer's self, in its
deepest green, so beautiful had ever been to them before, as
now the mild white of winter; and as their eyes were lifted
up to heaven, when had they ever seen before a sky of such
perfect blue, a sun so gentle in its brightness, or altogether
a week-day in any season so like a Sabbath in its stillness, so
like a holyday in its joy! Lovers were they-although as yet
they scarcely knew it; for from love only could have come such
bliss as now was theirs, a bliss that while it beautified was felt
to come from the skies.
Flora sang to Ranald many of her old songs to those wild
Gaelic airs that sound like the sighing of winds among fractured
cliffs, or the branches of storm-tossed trees when the subsiding
tempest is about to let them rest. Monotonous music! but irresistible over the heart it has once awakened and enthralled, so

sincere seems to be the mournfulness it breathes-a mournfulness brooding on the same note that is at once its natural
expression and its sweetest aliment--of which the singer never
wearieth in her dream, while her heart all the time is haunted
by all that is most piteous, by the faces of the dead in their
paleness returning to the shades of life, only that once more
they may pour from their fixed eyes those strange showers of
unaccountable tears!
How merry were they between those mournful airs! Howv
Flora trembled to see her lover's burning brow and flashing
eyes, as he told her tales of great battles fought in foreign lands,
far across the sea; tales which he had drunk in with greedy
ears from the old heroes scattered all over Lochaber and Badenoch, on the brink of the grave still garrulous of blood!
"The sun sat high in his meridian tower,"
but time had not been with the youthful lovers, and the blesse(d
beings believed that'twas but a little hour since beneath the
Eagle Cliff they had met in the prime of the morn!
The boy starts to his feet, and his keen eye looks along the
ready rifle; for his sires had all been famous deer-stalkers, and
the passion of the chase was hereditary in his blood. Lo! a
deer from Dalness, hound-driven or sullenly astray, slowly bearing his antlers up the glen, then stopping for a moment to snuff
the air, and then away-away! The rifle-shot rings dully from
the scarce echoing snow-cliffs, and the animal leaps aloft, struck
by a certain but not sudden death-wound. Oh! for Fingal now
to pull him down like a wolf! But laboring and lumbering
heavily along, the snow spotted as he bounds with blood, the
huge animal at last disappears round some rocks at the head of
the glen. "Follow me, Flora!" the boy-hunter cries; and
flinging down their plaids, they turn their bright faces to the
mountain, and away up the long glen after the stricken deer.
Fleet was the mountain-girl, and Ranald, as he ever and anon
looked back to wave her on, with pride admired her lightsome
motion as she bounded along the snow. Redder and redder
grew that snow-and more heavily trampled as they winded
round the rocks. Yonder is the deer staggering up the mountain, not half a mile off; now standing at bay, as if before his
swimming eyes came Fingal, the terror of the forest, whose howl
was known to all the echoes, and quailed the herd while their
antlers were yet afar off. "Rest, Flora! rest! while I fly to
him with my rifle, and shoot him through the heart!"
226HIGHLAND SNOW-STORM.
Up--up-up the interminable glen, that kept winding and
winding round many a jutting promontory, and many a castellated cliff, the red-deer kept dragging his gore-oozing bulk,
sometimes almost within, and then, for some hundreds of yards,
just beyond rifle-shot; while the boy, maddened by the chase,
pressed forwards, now all alone, nor any more looking behind,for Flora, who had entirely disappeared; and thus he was hurried on for miles by the whirlwind of passion, till at last he
struck the noble quarry, and down sank the antlers in the snow,
while the air was spurned by the convulsive beatings of feet.
Then leaped Ranald upon the red-deer like a beast of prey, and
lifted up a look of triumph to the mountain-tops.
Where is Flora?  Her lover has forgotten her-and he is
alone, nor knows it-he and the red-deer--an enormous animal
-fast stiffening in the frost of death.
Some large flakes of snow are in the air, and they seem to
waver and whirl, though an hour ago there was not a breath.
Faster they fall and faster-the flakes are almost as large as
leaves-and overhead, whence so suddenly has come that huge
yellow cloud?  "Flora, where are you? where are you, Flora?" and from the huge hide the boy leaps up, and sees that
no Flora is at hand. But yonder is a moving speck far off upon
the snow!'Tis she-'tis she; and again Ranald turns his
eyes upon the quarry, and the heart of the hunter burns
within him like a new-stirred fire. Shrill as the eagle's cry
disturbed in his eyrie, he sends a shout down the glen; and
Flora, with cheeks pale and bright by fits, is at last at his side.
Panting and speechless she stands, and then dizzily sinks orn his
breast. Her hair is ruffled by the wind that revives her, and
her face all moistened by the snow-flakes, now not falling but
driven; for the day has undergone a dismal change, and all
over the skies are now lowering savage symptoms of a fastcoming night-storm.
Bare is poor Flora's head, and sadly drenched her hair, that
an hour or two ago glittered'in the sunshinle. Her shivering
frame misses now the warmth of the plaid, which almost no cold
can penetrate, and which had kept the vital current flowing
freely in many a bittelr blast. What would the miserable boy
give now for the coverings lying far away, which, in his foolish
passion, he flung down to chase that fatal deer! " Oh! Flora!
if you would not fear to stay here by yourself, under the protection of God--who surely will not forsake you--soon will I
go and come fiom the place where our plaids are lying; and

In a concluding series, the one preceding the last particular requires a greater degree of the rising inflection, to
designate that the next particular will finish the series.
NOTE.-All series should be read with an increased expression of the voice, and a more prominent inflection on every particular.
Clauses of sentences which form complete sense, should
end with a moderated falling inflection.
Negative sentences, and negative members of sentences,
take the rising inflection.  When a series of negative sentences concludes a paragraph, the last member of the series
takes the falling inflection.
A concession, or admission, takes the rising inflection.
NoTE.--The use of the rising inflection, in negative sentences,
is of great importance.
Negative sentiment falls comparatively powerless on the
hearer, unless given with a strong rising inflection.
When the negative is opposed to the affirmative, the
former takes the rising, the latter the falling.  Unequal
antitheses, or contrasts, are governed by the same principle.
In the latter the less important member takes the rising,
and the preponderating one the falling inflection.
INTRODUCTION.
XXXTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
hurricane-you wiapt up in them, and folded-O my dearest
sister -in my arms 1"  ".I will go with you down the glen, Ranald!" and she left his breast-but, weak as a day-old lamb,
tottered and sank down on the snow. The cold-intense as if
the air were ice-had chilled ler very heart, after the heat of
that long race; and it was manifest that here she must be for
the night--to live or die. And the night seemed already come,
so full was the lift of snow; while the glimmer every moment
became gloomier, as if the day were expiring long before its'
time. IHowling at a distance down the glen was heard a seaborn tempest from the Linnhe-Loch, where now they both knew
the tide was tumbling in, bringing with it sleet and snow-blasts
from afar; and from the opposite quarter of the sky, an inland
tempest was raging to meet it, while every lesser glen had its
own uproar, so that on all hands they were environed with
death.
"I will go--and, till I return, leave you with God."--" Go,
Ranald!" and he went and came-as if he had been endowed
with the raven's wings!
Miles away, and miles back had he flowna--and an hour had
not been with his going and coming--b-lt what a dreary wretchedness meanwhile had been hers! She feared that she was
dying-that the cold snow-storm was killing her-and that she
would never more see Ranald, to say to him farewell. Soon as
he was gone, all her courage had died. Alone, she feared
death, and wept to think how hard it was for one so young thus
miserably to die. He came, and her whole being- was changed.
Folded up in both the plaids, she felt resigned. "Oh! kiss me,
kiss me, Ranald; for your love, great as it is, is not as my love.
You must never forget me, Ranald-when your poor Flora is
dead."
Religion with these two young creatures was as clear as the
light of the Sabbath-day; and their belief in heaven just the
same as in earth. The will of God they thought of just as they
thought of their parents' will; and the same was their loving
obedience to its decrees. If she was to die-supported now by
the presence of her brother-Flora was utterly resigned; if she
were to live, her heart imaged to itself the very forms of her
grateful worship. But all at once she closed her eyes-ceased
breathing-and, as the tempest howled and rumbled in the gloom
that fell around them like blindness, Ranald almost sank down,
thinking that she was dead.
"Wretched sinner that I am-my wicked madness brought
her heire to die of cold!"  And he smote his breast, and tore
228HIGHLAND SNOW-STORM.
his hair, and feared to look up, lest the angry eye of God were
looking on him through the storm.
All at once, without speaking a word, Ranald lifted Flora in
his arms, and walked away up the glen-here almost narrowed
into a pass. Distraction gave him supernatural strength, and
her weight seemed that of a child. Some walls of what had
once been a house, he had suddenly remembered, were but a
short way off-whether or not they had any roof, he had forgotten; but the thought even of such shelter seemed a thought
of salvation. There it was-a snow-drift at the opening that
had once been a door--snow up the holes once windows--the
wood of the roof had been carried off for fuel, and the snowflakes were falling in, as if they would soon fill up the inside of
the ruin. The snow in front was all trampled as if by sheep;
and carrying in his burden under the low lintel, he saw the
place was filled with a flock that had foreknown the hurricane,
and that, all huddled together, looked on him as on the shepherd come to see how they were faring in the storm.
And a young shepherd he was, with a lamb apparently dying
in his arms. All color, all motion, all breath seemed to be
gone; and yet something convinced his heart that she was yet
alive. The ruined hut was roofless, but across an angle of the
walls some pine-branches had been flung as a sort of shelter for
the sheep or cattle that might repair thither in cruel weather--
some pine-branches left by the wood-cutters who had felled the
few trees that once stood at the very head of the glen. Into
that corner the snow-drift had not yet forced its way, and he
sat down there with Flora in the cherishing of his embrace,
hoping that the warmth of his distracted heart might be felt by
her who was as cold as a corpse. The chill air was somewhat
softened by the breath of the huddled flock, and the edge of the
cutting wind blunted by the stones. It was a place in which it
seemed possible that she might revive--miserable as it was with
mire-mixed snow, and almost. as cold as one supposes the
grave. And she did revive, and under the half-open lids the
dim blue appeared to be not yet life-deserted. It was yet but
the afternoon--night-like though it was-and he thought, as he
breathed upon her lips, that a faint red returned, and that they
felt the kisses he dropped on them to drive death away.
" Oh! father, go seek for Ranald, for I dreamed to-night he
was perishing in the snow!"-" Flora, fear not-God is with
us."-" Wild swans, they say, are come to Loch-Phoil-let us
go, Ranald, and see them-but no rifle-for why kill creatures
said to be so beautiful?"  Over them where they lay, bended
229THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
down the pine-branch roof, as if it would give way beneath the
increasing weight; but there it still hung, though the drift
came over their feet and up to their knees, and seemed stealirig upwards to be their shroud. " Oh! I am overcome with
drowsiness, and fain would be allowed to sleep. Who is disturbing me, and what noise is this in our house?"-" Fear not,
fear not, Flora--God is with us."-" Mother! am I lying in
your arms?  My father surely is not in the storm! Oh! I
have had a most dreadful dream!"-and with such mutterings
as these Flora relapsed again into that perilous sleep, which
soon becomes that of death.
Night itself came, but Flora and Ranald knew it not, and
both lay now motionless in one snow-shroud. Many passionsthough earth-born, heavenly all-pity, and grief, and love, and
hope, and at last despair, had prostrated the strength they had
so long supported; and the brave boy-who had been for some
time feeble as a very child after a fever-with a mind confused
and wandering, and in its perplexities sore afraid of some nameless ill, had submitted to lay down his head beside his Flora's,
and had soon become like her insensible to the night and all its
storms!
Bright was the peat-fire in the hut of Flora's parents in Glenco; and they were among the happiest of the humble happy,
blessing this the birthday of their blameless child. They thought
of her singing her sweet songs by the fireside of the hut in
Glencreran; and tender thoughts of her cousin Ranald were
with them in their prayers. No warning came to their ears in
the sugh or the howl; for Fear it is that creates its own ghosts,
and all its own ghost-like visitings, and they had seen their Flora
in the meekness of the morning, setting forth on her way over
the quiet mountains, like a fawn to play. Sometimes, too,
Love, who starts at shadows as if they were of the grave, is
strangely insensible to realities that might well inspire dismay.
So was it now with the dwellers in the hut at the head of Glenereran. Their Ranald had left them in the morning; night had
come, and he and Flora were not there; but the day had been
almost like a summer day, and in their infatuation they never
doubted that the happy creatures had changed their minds, and
that Flora had returned with him to Glenco. Ranald had
laughingly said, that haply he might surprise the people in that
glen by bringing back to them Flora on her birthday; and strange
though it afterwards seemed to her to be, that belief prevented
one single fear from touching his mother's heart, and she and
her husband that night lay down in untroubled sleep.
230HIGHLAND SNOW-STORM.
And what:culd have been done for them, had they been
told by some good or evil spirit that their children were in the
clutches of such a night? As well seek for a single bark in the
middle of the misty main! But the inland storm had been seen
brewing among the mountains round King's House, and hut had
communicated with hut, though far apart in regions where the
traveller sees no symptoms of human life. Down through the
long cliff-pass of Mealanumy, between Buchael-Etive and the
Black-Mount, towards the lone House of Dalness, that lives in
everlasting shadows, went a band of shepherds, trampling their
way across a hundred frozen streams. D alness joined its
strength-and then away over the drift-bridged chasms toiled
that Gathering, with their sheep-dogs scouring the loose snows
-in the van, Fingal, the Red Reaver, with his head aloft on the
look-out for deer, grimly eyeing the Correi where last he tasted
blood. All "plaided in their tartan array," these shepherds
laughed at the storm-and hark! you hear the bagpipe playthe music the Highlanders love both in war and in peace,
"They think then of the ourie cattle,
And silly sheep;"
and though they ken'twill be a moonless night-for the snowstorm will sweep her out of heaven-up the mountain and down
the glen they go, marking where flock and herd have betaken
themselves, and now, at night-fall, unafraid of that blind hollow, they descend into the depth where once stood the old
Grove of Pines. Following the dogs, who know their duties in
their instinct, the band, without seeing it, are now close to that
ruined hut. Why bark the sheep-dogs so--and why howls
Fingal, as if some spirit passed athwart the night? He scents
the dead body of the boy who so often had shouted him on in
the forest, when the antlers went by! Not dead-nor dead
she who is on his bosom. Yet life in both is frozen-and will
the iced blood in their veins ever be thawed? Almost pitchdark is the roofless ruin-and the frighltened sheep know not
what is the terrible Shape that is howling there. But a man
enters, and lifts up one of the bodies, giving it into the arms of
them at the doorway-and then lifts up the other; and, by theflash of a rifle, they see that it is Ranald Cameron and Flora
Macdonald, seemingly both frozen to death. Some of those
reeds that the shepherds burn in their huts are kindled, and in
that small light they are assured that such are the corpses. But
that noble dog knows that death is not there-and licks the face
231THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
of Ranald,. as if he would restore life to his eyes. Two of the
shepherds know well how to fold the dying in their p:aidshow gentliest to carry them along; for they had learnt it on the
field of victorious battle, when, without stumbling over the dead
and wounded, they bore away the shattered body, vet living,
of the youthful warrior, who had shown that of such a clan he
was worthy to be the chief.
To life were brought the dead; and there at midnight sat
they up like ghosts. Strange seemed they, for a while, to each
other's eyes; and at each other they looked as if they had forgotten how dearly once they loved. Then as if in holy fear
they gazed on each other's faces, thinking that they had awoke
together in heaven. "Flora!" said Ranald;-and that sweet
word, the first he had been able to speak, reminded him of all
that had passed, and he knew that the God in whom they had
put their trust had sent them dellverance. Flora, too, knew
her parents, who were on their knees; and she strove to rise up
and kneel down beside them; but she was powerless as a
brokea reed, and when she thought to join them in thanksgiving, her voice was gone. Still as death sat all the people in
the hut--and one or two who were fathers were not ashamed
to weep.
Who were they-the solitary pair--all alone by themselves,
save a small image of her on whose breast it lay-whom, seven
summers after, we came upon in our wanderings, before their
Shieling in Correi-Vollach at the foot of Ben Chrulas, who
sees his shadow in a hundred lochs? Who but Ranald and
Flora?
The Influence of Woman in Free Governments.
WEBSTER.
IT is by the promulgation of sound morals in the community,
and, more especially, by the training and instruction of the
young, that woman performs her part towards the preservation
of a free government.  It is generally admitted that public
liberty, the perpetuity of a free constitution, rests on the virtue
and intelligence of the community which enjoys it. How is
that virtue to be inspired, and how is that intelligence to be
232INFLUENCE OF WOMAN IN FREE GOVERNMENT. 233
communicated?   Bonaparte once asked Madame de Stael in
what manner he could most promote the happiness of France.
Her reply is full of political wisdom. She said: "Instruct the
mothers of the French people." Mothers are, indeed, the affectionate and effective teachers of the human race. The mother
begins her process of training with the infant in her arms. It
is she who directs, so to speak, its first mental and spiritual
pulsations. She conducts it along the impressible years of
childhood and youth, and hopes to deliver it to the rough contests and tumultupus scenes of life, armed by those good principles which her child has received from maternal care and
love.
If we draw within the circle of our contemplation the mothers
of a civilized nation, what do we see?  We behold so many
artificers working, not on frail and perishable matter, but on the
immortal mind, moulding and fashioning beings who are to exist
forever. We applaud the artist whose skill and genius present
the mimic man upon the canvass; we admire and celebrate the
sculptor who works out that same image in enduring marble;
but how insignificant are these achievements, though the highest
and the fairest in all the departments of art, in comparison with
the great vocation of human mothers! They work, not upon
the canvass that shall fail, or the marble that shall crumble into
dust, but upon mind, upon spirit, which is to last forever, and
which is to bear, for good or evil, throughout its duration, the
impress of a mother's plastic hand.
I have already expressed the opinion, which all allow to be
correct, that our security for the duration of the free ins.titutions which bless our country depends upon the habits of virtue
and the prevalence of knowledge and of education. Knowledge
does not comprise all which is contained in the larger term of
education. The feelings are to be disciplined; the passions are
to be restrained; true and worthy motives are to be inspired;
a profound religious feeling is to be instilled, and pure morality
inculcated, under all circumstances. All this is comprised in
education. Mothers who are faithful to this great duty will
tell their children that neither in political nor in any other concerns of life can man ever withdraw himself from the perpetual
obligations of conscience and of duty; that in every act,
whether public or private, he incurs a just responsibility; and
that in no condition is he warranted in trifling with important
lights and obligations. They will impress upon their children
the truth, that the exercise of the elective franchise is a social
duty, of as solemn a nature as man can be called to perform;THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
that a man may not innocently trifle with his vote; that every
free elector is a trustee, as well for others as himself; and that
every man and every measure he supports has an important
bearing on the interests of others as well as on his own. It is
in the inculcation of high and pure morals, such as these, that,
in a free republic, woman performs her sacred duty, and fulfils
her destiny.
Our Government a System of Checks.
GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.
OUR governlmlent is a system of salutary checks: one legislative branch is a check on the other. And should the violence
of party spirit bear both of them away, the President, an officer
high in honor, high in the public confidence, charged with
weighty concerns, responsible to his own reputation and to the
world, stands ready to arrest their too impetuous course. This
is our system. It makes no mad appeal to every mob in the
country. It appeals to the sober sense of men selected from
their fellow-citizens for their talents, for their virtue; of men
advanced in life, and of matured judgment. It appeals to their
understanding, to their integrity, to their honor, to their love of
fame, to their sense of shame. If all these checks should prove
insufficient, and alas! such is the condition of human nature,
that I fear they will not always be sufficient, the Constitution
has given us one more; it has given us an independent judiciary.
VWe have been told that the executive authority carries your
laws into execution. But let us not be the dupes of sound.
The executive magistrate commands, indeed, your fleets and
armies; and duties, imposts; excises, and other taxes are collected, and all expenditures are made by officers whom he has
appointed. So far, indeed, he executes your laws. But these,
his acts, apply not often to individual concerns. In those cases,
so important to the peace and happiness of society, the execution of your laws is confided to your judges; and therefore are
they rendered independent. Before, then, that you violate that
independence-pause. There are State sovereignties as well as
the sovereignty of the general government. There are cases,
too many cases, ill which the interest of one is not considered
234THE SHIPWRECK
as the interest of the other. Should these conflict, if the judiciary be gone, the question is no longer of law, but of force.
This is a state of things which no honest and wise man can
view without horror.
Suppose, in the omnipotence of your legislative authority,
you trench upon the rights of your fellow-citizens by passing
an unconstitutional law: if the judiciary department preserve
its vigor, it will stop you short; instead of a resort to arms,
there will be a happier appeal to argument. Suppose a case
still more impressive. The President is at the head of your
armies. Let one of his generals, flushed with victory, and proud
in command, presume to trample on the rights of your most
insignificent citizen: indignant of the wrong, he will demand
the protection of your tribunals, and, safe in the shadow    of
their wings, will laugh his oppressor to scorn.
The Shipwreck.-BYRON.
AT one o'clock the wind with sudden shift,
Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,
Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,
Started the stern-post, also shattered the
Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift
Herself from out her present jeopardy,
The rudder tore away:'twas time to sound
The pumps, and there were four feet water found.
As day advanced the weather seemed to abate,
And then the leak they reckoned to reduce,
And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
Kept two hand and one chain pump still in use.
The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
A gust-which all descriptive power transcendsLaid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.
Immediately the masts were cut away,
Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
The mainmast followed: but the ship still lay
Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.
Foremast and bowsprit were cut down. and they
Eased her at last, (although we nevez meant
To part with all till every hope was blighted,)
And then with violence the old ship righted.
235THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
But now there came a flash.of hope once more;
Day broke, and the wind lulled: the masts were gone,
The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.
They tried the pumps again, and though before
Their desperate efforts seemed all useless grown,
A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to baleThe stronger pumped, the weaker thrummed a sail
Again the weather threatened-again blew
A gale, and in the fore and after hold
Water appeared; yet, though the people knew
All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
Until the chains and leathers were worn through
Of all our pumps: a wreck complete she rolled
At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are
Like human beings during civil war.'Twas twilight, and the sunless day went down
Over the waste of waters; like a veil,
Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown
Of one whose fate is masked but to assail.
Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,
And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
And the dim desolate deep; twelve days had Fear
Been their familiar, and now Death was here.
At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose
That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,
For yet they strove, although of no great use;
There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
And, going down head foremost-sunk, in short.
Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewellThen shrieked the timid, and stood still the braveThen some leaped overboard with dreadful yell,
As eager to anticipate their grave;
And the sea yawned around her like a hell,
And down she sucked with her the whirling wave,
Like one who grapples with his enemy,
And strives to strangle him before he die.
And first one universal shriek there rushed,
Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash
Of echoing thunder; and then all was hushed,
Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
Of billows; but at intervals there gushed,
Accompanied with a convulsive splash,
A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
Of some strong swimmer in his agony.

O AIl divine! And ye, swift-winged Winds!
Ye River-fountains! and ye countless smiles
Of dimpling Ocean! Mother Earthl   And thou,
Far-piercing Eye of day! On you I call.
Witness what I, a god, from gods endure.
Behold, with what fierce pangs, years without end,
Amerced, have I to struggle here; such chains
Hath this new king of gods devised for me.
Present and fuiture, both, alas! I wail;
When shall these woes have end? But why inquire V
Since clear before me lies the Future, nor
Can aught of evil, unforeseen, betide.
Then bear what must be, nor wage war with stern
Necessity's unconquerable power.
But to complain, or not complain, alike
Is unavailable. For favors shown
To mortal man I bear this weight of woe.
Hid in a hollow cane the fount of fire
I privately conveyed, of every art
The instructress, and best, noblest gift to man.
For this, this one offense, I wear these chains.
Woe! woe!-But whence that sound! Whence yon sweet odor
Soft-stealing o'er the sense?-And who comes there,
Divine, or mortal, or of hero-race?
Comes he to this far rock, spectator of
My wretchedness, or for what other purpose?
Behold me then in chains, a wretched god,
Abhorred by Jove, and all who tread his courts,
For my fond love of man. Ah me! again
I hear. a sound, as if of birds. The air
Rustles with fluttering pinions; every object
Approaching me strikes terror on my soul.

Emphatic negation takes the falling inflection.
Questions which can be answered by Yes, or No, or
commencing with a verb, terminate with the rising inflection.
Emphasis breaks through this rule.
When a question commences with an interrogative adverb or pronoun, it ends with the falling inflection.
In a long series of questions, terminating a paragraph,
the last member may take the falling inflection.
Exclamations of joy and surprise take the rising; fear,
anger, scorn, grief, and awe, the falling inflection.
NOTE.-It will be necessary for the pupil to practise on the
slides from the rising to the falling inflection, so as to be able
to inflect with ease, andtin a full sonorous voice, divested of all
angularity or abruptness.
EMPHASIS.
By emphasis is meant that stronger, fuller sound of the
voice, by which in reading, or speaking, we distinguish the
accented syllable of words on which we design to throw
particular stress, in order to show how they affect the rest
of the sentence.
It is obvious that on the right management of Emphasis

In dreams his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch's signet ring--
Then pressed that monarch's throne-a king;
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden's garden bird.
An hour passed on-the Turk awoke;
That bright dream was his last;

HIe woke-to die'midst flame and smoke,
And shout, anld groan, and sabre stroke,
And death-shots falling thick and fast

And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,

Strike-for your altars and your fires,
Strike-for the green graves of your sires,
God-and your native land!"
They fought, like brave men, long and well,
They piled that ground with Moslem slain,
They conquered-but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.

His smile, when rang their proud hurrah,
And the red field was won;
They saw in death his eyelids close
Calmly, as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
Come to the bridal chamber, Death!
Come to the mother, when she feels,
For, the first time, her first-born's breath;Come when the blessed seals
Which close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke
Come in Consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake shock, the ocean storm -
Come when the heart beats high and warm,
With banquet-song, and dance, and wmneAnd thou art terrible: the tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear
Of agony, are thine.
But to the hero, when his sword
Has won the battle for the free,
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be.

That were not born die.
Washington.-ELIZA CooK.
LAND of the west! though passing brief
The record of thine age,
Thou hast a name that darkens all
On history's wide page!
Let all the blasts of fame ring out--
Thine shall be loudest far:
Let others boast their satellitesThou hast the planet star.
Thou hast a name whose characters
Of light shall ne'er depart;'Tis stamped upon the dullest brain,
And warms the coldest heart;
A war-cly fit for any land
Where freedom's to be won.
Land of the west! it stands aloneIt is thy Washington!
Rome had its Caesar, great and brave;
But stain was on his wreath:
He lived the heartless conqueror,
And died the tyrant's death.
France had its eagle; but his wings,
Though lofty they might soar,
Were spread in false ambition's flight,
And dipped in murder's gore.
Those hero-gods, whose mighty sway
Would fain have chained the wavesWho fleshed their blades with tiger zeal,
To make a world of slavesWho, though their kindred barred the path,
Still fiercely'v.,ded onOh, where shall be their " g'.ry" by

239THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
He fought, but not with love of strife,
He struck but to defend;
And ere he turned a people's foe,
He sought to be a friend.
He strove to keep his country's right,
By reason's gentle word,
And sighed when fell injustice threw
The challenge-sword to sword.
He stood the firm, the calm, the wise,
The patriot and sage;
He showed no deep, avenging hateNo burst of despot rage.
He stood for liberty and truth,
And dauntlessly led on,
Till shouts of victory gave forth,
The name of Washington.
No car of triumph bore him through
A city filled with grief;
No groaning captives at the wheels,
Proclaimed him victor chief;
He broke the gyves of slavery,
With strong and high disdain,
And cast no sceptre firom the links
When he had crushed the chain.
He saved his land, but did not lay
His soldier trappings down
To change tlhem for the regal vest,
And deon a kingly crown.
Fame was too earnest in her joyToo proud of such a sonTo let a robe and title mask
A noble Washington.
Primitive Habits of New          Amsterdam.-w. IvIv.
IN those happy days a well-regulated family always rose with
She dawn, dined at eleven, and went to bed at sun-down. Dinner was invariably a private meal, and the fat old burghers
showed incontestable symptoms of disapprobation and uneasiness at being surprised by a visit from a neighbor on such
occasions. But though our worthy ancestors were thus singularly averse to giving dinners, yet they kept up the social bands
of intimacy by occasional banquetings, called tea-parties.
240PRIMITIVE HAJ3ITS OF N,EW AMSTERDAM.       241
These fashionable parties were generally confined to the
higher classes, or noblesse; that is to say, such as kept their
own cows, and drove their own wagons. The company commonly assembled at three o'clock, and went away about six,
unless it was in winter time, when the fashionable hours were a
little earlier, that the ladies might get home before dark. The
tea-table was crowned with a huge earthen dish, well stored
with slices of fat pork, fried brown, cut up into morsels, and
swimming in gravy. The company being seated around the
genial board, and each furnished with a fork, evinced their dexterity in lanching at the fattest pieces in this mighty dish-in
much the same manner as sailors harpoon porpoises at sea, or
our Indians spear salmon in the lakes.  Sometimes the table
was graced withl immense apple-pies, or saucers full of preserved
peaches and pears; but it was always sure to boast an enormous dish of balls of sweetened doughl, fried in hog's fat, and
doughnuts, or olykoeks--a delicious kind of cake, at present
scarce known in this city, excepting in genuine Dutch families.
The tea was served out of a majestic delft tea-pot, ornamented
with paintings of fat little Dutch shepherds and shepherdesses
tending pigs-with boats sailing in the air, and houses-built in
the clouds, and sundry other ingenious Dutch fantasies. The
beaux distinguished themselves by their adroitness in replenishing this pot from a huge copper tea-kettle, which would have
made the pigmy macaronies of these degenerate days sweat
merely to look at it. To sweeten the beverage, a lump of sugar
was laid beside each cup-and the company alternately nibbled
and sipped with great decorum, until an improvement was
introduced by a shrewd and economic old lady, which was to
suspend a large lump directly over the tea-table by a string
from the ceiling, so that it could be swung from mouth to
mouth-an ingenious expedient which is still kept up by some
families in Albany; but which prevails without exception in
Communipaw, Bergen, Flatbush, and all our uncontaminated
Dutch villages.
At these primitive tea-parties the utmost propriety and dignity of deportment prevailed.  No flirting or coqueting--no
gambling of old ladies, nor hoyden chattering and romping of
young ones-no self-satisfied struttings of wealthy gentlemen,
with their brains in their pockets-nor amusing conceits and
monkey divertisements of smart young gentlemen with no
brains at all. On the contrary, the young ladies seated themselves demurely in their rush-bottomed chairs, and knit their
own woollen stockings; nor ever opened their lips, excepting to
11THE PRACTICAL ELOCIQTIONIST.
say yaw, Mynher, or yaw, yaw, Vrouw, to any question that
was asked them; behaving in all things like decent, welleducated damsels. As to the gentlemen, each of them tranquilly smoked his pipe, and seemed lost in contemplation of the
blue and white tiles with which the fire-places were decorated;
wherein sundry passages of Scripture were piously portrayedTobit and his dog figured to great advantage; Haman swung
conspicuously on his gibbet; and Jonah appeared most manfully bouncing out of the whale, like Harlequin through a barrel of fire.
The parties broke up without noise and without confusion.
They were carried home by their own carriages, that is to say,
by the vehicles Nature had provided them, excepting such of
the wealthy as could afford to keep a wagon. The gentlemen
gallantly attended their fair ones to their respective abodes, and
took leave of them with a hearty smack at the door; which, as
it was an established piece of etiquette, done in perfect simp:icity and honesty of heart, occasioned no scandal at that time,
nor should it at the present: if our great-grandfathers approved
of the custom, it would argue a great want of reverence in their
descendants to say a word against it.
1The Patriot's Hope for Ireland.-REv. HENRY G.ILES
IF a soil the most fertile has borne but a starving peasantry;
if noble rivers have flowed unburdened to the sea; if capacious
harbors have been ruffled by no freighted keels; if mines of
wealth have slumbered untouched in the sleeping earth, still I
do not despair for my country. The soil is there yet in its
beauty, and its children may yet live upon its fullness. The
rivers are yet majestic, and will not always be a solitude. The
broad and sheltered bay, that now mirrors but the mountains
and the heavens, may yet reflect the snowy drapery of many a
gallant ship; and the hills, on which now the ragged and dejected shepherd wanders, may yet yield up their treasures to
the light. Nature is not dead. Nature is not dead in the works
of creation or in the soul of man.  Nature is not dead; but
ever, in its generous beauty, covers and supports us. No foolish passions can dry up the kindly breast of earth, or consume
the fatness of the clouds, or shut out the glory of the skies,
242THE PATRIOT'S HOPE FOR IRELAND.
Nature yet survives-survives in her limitless bounty-survives
in her eternal youth; and the people, though impoverished, are
not destroyed. No wrongs have been able to crush them, no
wars to render them inhuman.  From every savage influence
they have come forth, not indeed uninjured, but yet not deeply
degraded nor ruthlessly depraved. From the worst experience
in the history of nations, they have saved elements of excellence
that may be shaped into the noblest civilization. From a long
and dreary night of bondage, they have escaped with the vivid
intellect, the cheerful temper, the affectionate spirit, the earnest,
the hopeful enthusiasm that springs, elastic, from every sorrow.
The hour now seems dark in Ireland, but the light is not
quenched; it is only for a season obscured. The cloud is thick
and broad; it rests heavily over the shivering millions; it is
most dreary; and it seems filled with threatenings. But the
moveless sun is shining tranquilly above it in the benignant and
the everlasting heavens.  The cloud may break in tempest;
but stillness and beauty will come when the hurricane has spent
its strength, and the storm has passed away. But no tempest
will, possibly, come at all. The cloud may dissolve in rain; it
may give freshness where it had only given gloom, and cool the
ardor of the beams which it had excluded. Heavy skies bring
lightning; lightning brings the shower; then comes the sunshine
on the grass, and all the fields are sparkling with glory and with
gems.   Let me so think of the moral atmosphere that now
hangs around and over Ireland. It is not to continue. God is
in his universe, and guides the nations in their way. We will
hold to our goodly trust; and, in the strength of that earnest
trust, we will firmly believe that he has rich blessings yet in
store for Ireland. Where often we can see nothing but evil,
our gracious Father is preparing good; and we will so believe
it now, for sad, afflicted, mourning Ireland. Oh, land of my
heart, of my fathers, and my birth! I will ever keep it in my
thoughts that God is looking down upon you with pity and with
grace, and that he will call you up more brightly from your
calamity.  The times, indeed, seem bad; but suffering will
leave its blessings. Plenty will come again; and humility, and
gratitude, and mercy, and penitent and softened hearts, will
come along with it. Peace will be established-confidence will
come with peace-capital will follow confidence-employment
will increase with capital-education will be desired-knowledge
will be diffused--and virtue will grow with knowledge. Yet,
even if these things should not soon be; if all that is now anticipated should long be "hope deferred," and many a heart
243'1iHE pi-RC:CT]iCAL ELOCU'TIONIST.
should sicken in waiting for relief, yet I will not despond; I will
not despond for Ireland; I will not despond for humanity; I
will entertain no doubt in the Agency which guides the world,
and no mistrust in the destiny whereunto the world moves.
We cannot, in this condition of trial, look for the extinction of
evil; but we may for its amelioration. We cannot hope for
perfection, but we may hope for progress. Confidence in progress is not presumption, but faith--faith in Providence and faith
in prophecy; faith in Providence, justified by history--for history is the record of Providence, in the development of ages;
faith in prophecy, justified by promise--for prophecy has ever
been a voice in the hearts of God's inspired ones, with the
promise of better times and better things. Sustained in the
power of this faith, whether I look before or whether I look
after, there is encouragement, there is good. In the retrospect,
I behold but blanlks on many a spot where tyrants had built
their thrones for eternity, when they dared in their pride and in
their guilt to say, "We are gods, and who shall destroy us?"
VThere superstition had muttered her midnight mysteries in the
darkness of heathendorn, I find but noisome ruins-the screech
of the owl and the cry of the raven. I trace the way of the
past over many a battle-field on which truth and liberty were
fought--on which truth and liberty were victors.  I behold
along that track the wrecks of a thousand errors and the prints
of a thousand crimes; and I see that the errors and the crimes
which left them have melted as a, dream, or vanished as a vision
of the night. I look onward-onward-onward, and I behold
nan--advancing man-triumphant man-the light of heaven on
his brow-the fire of freedom in his eye-the inspiration of
righteousness in his regenerated soul--his proud foot on the
grave of buried oppressions, and his exalted voice swelling
gloriously aloud into the lofty hallelujahs of enlightened and
of emancipated nations.
Glory.-PRESIDENT WAYLAND.
THE crumbling tombstone and the gorgeous mausoleum, the
sculptured marble and the venerable cathedral, all bear witnless
to the instinctive desire within us to be remembered by coming
generations. But how short-lived is the immortality which the
244works of our hands can confer! The noblest monuments of art
that the world has ever seen are covered with the soil of twenty
centuries. The works of the age of Pericles lie at the foot of
the Acropolis in indiscriminate ruin. The ploughshare turns up
the marble which the hand of Phidias had chiselled into beauty,
and the Mussulman has folded his flock beneath the falling
columns of the temple of Minerva. But even the works of our
hands too frequently survive the memory of those who have
created them. And were it otherwise, could we thus carry
down to distant ages the recollection of our existence, it were
surely childish to waste the energies of an immortal spirit in
the effort to make it known to other times, that a being whose
name was written with certain letters of the alphabet once lived,
and flourished, and died. Neither sculptured marble, nor stately
column, can reveal to other ages the lineaments of the spirit;
tand these alone can embalm our memory in the hearts of a
grateful posterity. As the stranger stands beneath the dome
of St. Paul's, or treads, with religious awe, the silent aisles of
Westminster Abbey, the sentiment which is breathed from every
object around him is, the utter emptiness of sublunary glory.....
The fine arts, obedient to private affection or public gratitude,
have here imbodied, in every form, the finest conceptions of
which their age was capable. Each one of these monuments
has been watered by the tears of the widow, the orphan, or the
patriot. But generations have passed away, and mourners and
mourned have sunk together into forgetfulness. The aged crone,
or the smooth-tongued beadle, as now he hurries you through
aisles and chapel, utters, with measured cadence and unmeaning
tone, for the thousandth time, the name and lineage of the
once honored dead; and then gladly dismisses you, to repeat
again his well-conned lesson to another group of idle passersby. Such, in its most august form, is all the immortality that
matter can confer..... It is by what we ourselves have done,
and not by what others have done for us, that we shall be
remembered by after ages. It is by thought that has aroused
my intellect from its slumbers, which has "given lustre to virtue, and dignity to truth," or by those examples which have
inflamed my soul with the love of goodness, and not by means
of sculptured marble, that I hold communion with Shakspeare
and Milton, with Johnson and Burke, with Howard and Wilberforce.
GLORY.
245IETH PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
The Age of Revolutions.-EDWARD EVERET.
THE present age may be justly described as the Age of Revolutions. The whole civilized world is agitated with political
convulsions, and seems to be panting and struggling in agony
after some unattained-perhaps unattainable good. From the
commencement of our revolution up to the present day, we
have witnessed, in Europe and America, an uninterrupted series
of important changes. The thrones of the Old World have been
shaken to their foundations. On our own continent, empires
that bore the name of colonies, have shaken or are shaking off
the shackles of dependence. And so far is this, the age of revolutions, which has already lasted more than half a century,
from having reached its termination, that the very last year has
been more fruitful in the most tremendous convulsions, than any
preceding one; and the present will probably be still more
agitated than the last. Every arrival from abroad brings us
intelligence of some new event of the highest moment; some
people rising in revolt against their sovereign; some new constitution proclaimed in one country; some reform, equivalent to
a new constitution, projected in another; France, in the midst
of a dangerous revolutionary crisis; Belgium, Poland, and Italy,
the scenes of actual hostilities; England, on the eve of commotion: the whole European commonwealth apparently plunging
again into the gulf of general war.
What is the object of all these -desperate struggles?  The
object of them is to obtain an extension of individual liberty.
Established institutions have lost their influence and authority.
Men have become weary of submitting to names and forms
which they once reverenced. It has been ascertained-to use
the language of Napoleon, that a throne is only four boards
covered with velvet-that a written constitution is but a sheet
of parchment. There is, in short, an effort making throughout
the world to reduce the action of Government within the narrowest possible limits, and to give the widest possible extent to
individual liberty.
Our own country, though happily exempt-and God grant
that it may long continue so-from the troubles of Europe, is
not exempt from the influence of the causes that produce them.
We too are inspired and agitated, and governed by the all-pervading, all-inspiring, all-agitating, all-governing spirit of the age.
What do I say? We were the first to feel and act upon its
influence. Our revolution was the first of the long series that
246BELSHAZZAR.
has since shaken every corner of Europe ani America. Our
fathers led the van in the long array of heroes, martyrs, and
confessors, who had fought and fallen under the banner of liberty.  The institutions they bequeathed to us, and under which
we are living in peace and happiness, were founded on the principles which lie at the bottom of the present agitation in Europe.
We have realized what our contemporaries are laboring to attain.
Our tranquillity is the fruit of an entire acquiescence in the spirit
of the age. We have reduced the action of Government within
narrower limits, and given a wider scope to individual liberty,
than any community that ever flourished before.
Belshazzar.-CROLY.
Hour of an Empire's overthrow I
The princes from the feast were gone;
The Idol flame was burning low;-'Twas midnight upon Babylon.
that night the feast was wild and high;
That night was Sion's gold profaned;
The seal was set to blasphemy;
The last deep cup of wrath was drained.'Mid jewelled roof and silken pall,
Belshazzar on his couch was flung;
A burst of thunder filled the hall--
He heard-but'twas no mortal tongue:
"King of the East! the trumpet calls,
That calls thee to a tyrant's grave:
A curse is on thy palace wallsA curse is on thy guardian wave:
"A surge is in Euphrates' bed,
That never filled its bed before;
A surge, that, ere the morn be red,
Shall load with death its haughty shore.
"Behold a tide of Persian steel!
A torrent of the Median car;
Like flame their gory banners wheel;
Rise, king, and arm thee for the war 1"
247phasis overdone and overcharged is repulsive to good taste
and sound judgment.
Elocutionists have described emphasis as being either
" absolute " or " relative" the first confined to the utterance of a single thought or feeling of decided expression;
the latter in connection, or opposition of two or more
ideas.
Exclamations and interjections usually require impassioned or absolute emphasis. " Every new incident in
narration," each particular object in description, and each
new subject in didactic passages, require to be marked with
distinctive emphatic stress sufficient to render them striking,r prominent.
Corresponding, and antithetical words should be emphatically marked in the delivery: when contrasted or compared,
the objects of greater importance should be given with a
stronger emphatic expression.
When great force is desired in the delivery of a particu-.
lar phrase, every word, and even the parts of compound
words, are given with emphatic expression.
A climax should be rendered, with the voice gradually
ascending in expression until the close.
An anti-climax decreases in energy as it proceeds, the
last member taking the falling inflection.
Repetition requires high rising inflection, acquiring fresh
intensity from the iteration.
Circumflex, or Wave, is a species of emphasis which
combines the rising and falling inflection on the same word.

XXXiiTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST,
Belshazzar gazed; the voice was pastThe lofty chamber filled with gloom;
But echoed on the sudden blast
The rushing of a mighty plume.
He listened; all again was still;
He heard no chariot's iron clang;
He heard the fountain's gushing rill,
The breeze that through the roses sang,
He slept; in sleep wild murmurs came;
A visioned splendor fired the sky;
He heard Belshazzar's taunted name;
He heard again the Prophet cry"Sleep, Sultan!'tis thy final sleep,
Or wake, or sleep, the guilty dies.
The wrongs of those who watch and weep,
Around thee and thy nation rise."
He started;'mid the battle's yell,
He saw the Persian rushing on:
He saw the flames around him swell;
Thou'rt ashes! King of Babylon.

Of these appointed days.
Still is it true, and over true,
That I delight to close
This book of life self-wise and new,
And let my thoughts repose

To them was life a simple art
Of duties to be done,
A game where each man took his part,
A race where all must run;
A battle whose great scheme and scope
They little cared to know,
Content, as men-at-arms, to cope
Each with his fronting foe.
Man now his virtue's diadem
Puts on, and proudly wearsGreat thoughts, great feelings, came to them,
Like instincts unawares:

Now let there be the merry sound
Of music and the dance,
Through thy corn-fields green, and sunny vines
Oh pleasant land of France!
And thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle,
Proud city of the waters,
Again let rapture light the eyes
Of all thy mourning daughters.
As thou wert constant in our ills,
Be joyous in our joy,.

Who wrought thy walls annoy.
Hurrah! lhurrah! a single field
Hath turned the chance of war,
Hurrah! hurrab: for Ivry,
And King Henry of Navarre I
Oh! how our hearts were beating,
When, at the dawn of day,
We saw the army of the League
Drawn out in long array;
With all its priest-led citizens,
And all its rebel peers,
And Appenzel's stout infantry,
And Egmont's Flemnish spears.
There rode the brood of false Lorraine,
The curses of our land!
And dark Mayenne was in the midst,
A truncheon in his hand;
And, as we looked on them, we thought
Of Seine's empurpled flood,
And good Coligni's hoary hair
All dabbled with his blood;
And we cried unto the living God,
Who rules the fate of war,
To fight for his own holy name,
And Henry of Navarre.
The king is come to marshal us,
In all his armor drest,
And he has bound a snow-white plume
Upon his gallant crest.
He looked upon his people,
And a tear was in his eye;
He looked upon the traitors,
And his glance was stern and high.
Right graciously he smiled on us,
As rolled from wing to wing,
Down all our line, in deafening shout
" God save our lord, the king."
"And if my standard-bearer fall,
As fall full well he mayFor never saw I promise yet

Now by the lips of those ye love,
Fair gentlemen of France,
Charge for the golden lilies now,
Upon them with the lance I
A thousand spurs are striking deep,
A thousand spears in rest,
A thousand knights are pressing close
Behind the snow-white crest;
And in they burst, and on they rushed,
While, like a guiding star,
Amidst the thickest carnage blazed
The helnet of Navarre.
Now, God be praised, the day is ours!
Mayenne hath turned his rein.
D'Aumale hath cried for quarterThe Flemish Count is slain.
Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds
Before a Biscay gale;
The field is heaped with bleeding steeds,
And flags, and cloven mail;
And then we thought on vengeance,
And all along our van,
"Remember St. Bartholem ew,"
Was passed from man to man;
But out spake gentle Henry,
" No Frenchman is my foe;
Down, down, with every foreigner;
But let your brethren go."
Oh! was there ever such a knight,
In friendship or in war,
As our sovereign lord, King Henry,

That Antwerp monks may sing a mass
For thy poor spearmen's souls!
Ho! gallant nobles of the League

Ho! burghers of St. Genevieve,
Keep watch and ward to-night!
For our God hath crushed thy tyrant,
Our God hath raised the slave,
And mocked the counsel of the wise
And the valor of the brave.
Then glory to his holy name
From whom all glories are;
And glory to our sovereign lord,

Robin Hood.-SCOTT.
"THE yeomen and commons," said De Bracy, "must not be
dismissed discontented, for lack of their share in the sports."
"The day," said Waldemar, "is not yet very far spent-let
the archers shoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be
adjudged. This will be an abundant fulfilment of the prince's
promises, so far as this herd of Saxon serfs is concerned."
" I thank thee, Waldemar," said the prince; "thou remindest
me, too, that I have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who
yesterday insulted our person."
The sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who
had already begun to leave the field; and proclamation was
made that Prince John, suddenly called by high and peremptory
public duties, held himself obliged to discontinue the entertainments of to-morrow's festival. Nevertheless, that, unwilling so
many good yeomen should depart without a trial of skill, he
was pleased to appoint them, before leaving the ground, presently to execute the competition of archery intended for the
morrow. To the best archer a prize was to be awarded, being
a bugle-horn, mounted with silver, and a silken baldric richly
ornamented with a medallion of Saint Hubert, the patron of
silvan sport.
More than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as
competitors, several of whom were rangers and under-keepers
in the royal forests of Needwood and Charnwood. When,
however, the archers understood with whom they were to be
252matched, upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the
contest, unwilling to encounter the dishonor of almost certain
defeat. For in those days the skill of each celebrated marksman was as well known for many miles round him, as the qualities of a horse trained at Newmarket are familiar to those who
frequent that well-known meeting.
The diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still
amounted to eight. Prince John stepped from his royal seat to
view more nearly the persons of these chosen yeomen, several
of whom wore the royal livery. Having satisfied his curiosity,
by this investigation, he looked for the object of his resentment,
whom he observed standing on the same spot, and with the
same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the
preceding day.
" Fellow," said Prince John,', I guessed by thy insolent babble thou wert no true lover of the long-bow, and I see thou
darest not adventure thy skill among such merry-men as stand
yonder."
"Under favor, sir," replied the yeoman, "I have another
reason for refraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture
and disgrace."
" And what is thy other reason?" said Prince John, who, for
some cause, which perhaps he could not himself have explained,
felt a painful curiosity respecting this individual.
"Because," replied the woodsman, " I know not if these yeomen and I are used to shoot at the same marks; and because,
moreover, I know not how your grace might relish the winning
*of a third prize by one who has unwittingly fallen under your
displeasure."
Prince John colored as he put the question, "What is thy
name, yeoman?"
"Locksley," answered the yeoman.
"Then, Locksley," said Prince John, "thou shalt shoot in
thy turn, when these yeomen have displayed their skill. If
thou carriest the prize, I will add to it twenty nobles; but
if thou losest it, thou shalt be stript of thy Lincoln green, and
scourged out of the lists with bowstrings, for a wordy and insolent braggart."
"And how if I refuse to shoot on such a wager?" said the
yeoman? "Your grace's power, supported as it is by so many
men-at-arms, may indeed easily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to bend or draw my bow."
"If thou refusest my fair proffer," said the prince, " the provost of the lists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and

arrows, and expel thee from the presence as a faint-hearted
craven."
"This is no fair chance you put on me, proud prince," said
the yeoman, " to compel me to peril myself against the best
archers of Leicester and Staffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me. Nevertheless, I will obey
your pleasure."
A target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue
which led to the lists. The contending archers took their station in turn at the bottom of the southern access; the distance
between that station and the mark allowing full distance for
what was called a shot at rovers. The archers having previously determined by lot their order of precedence, were to
shoot each three shafts in succession. The sports were regulated by an officer of inferior rank, termed the Provost of the
Games; for the high rank of the marshals of the lists would
have been held degraded had they condescended to superintend
the sports of the yeomanry.
One by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their
shafts yeomanlike and bravely. Of twenty-four arrows shot in
succession, ten were fixed in the target, and the others ranged
so near it, that, considering the distance of the mark, it was
accounted good archery.  Of the ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot by Hubert, a forester
in the service of Malvoisin, who was accordingly pronounced
victorious.
"Now, Locksley," said Prince John to the bold yeoman,
with a bitter smile, " wilt thou try conclusions with Hubert, or
wilt thou yield up bow, baldric, and quiver, to the provost of
the sports?"
" Sith it be no better," said Locksley, " I am content to try
my fortune, on condition that when I have shot two shafts at
yonder mark of Hubert's, he shall be bound to shoot one at that
which I shall propose."
" That is but fair," answered Prince John, "and it shall not
be refused thee. If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I
will fill the bugle with silver pennies for thee."
"A man can do but his best," answered Hubert; "b: t my
grandsire drew a good long-bow at Hastings, and I trusV not to
dishonor his memory."
The former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the
same size placed in its room. Hubert, who, as victor in the
first trial of skill, had the right to shoot first, took his aim with
great deliberation, long measuring the distance with his eye,
254while he held in his hand his bended bow, with the arrow placed
on the string. At length he made a step forward, and raising
the bow at the full stretch of his left arm, till the centre or
grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he drew his bowstring to his ear. The arrow whistled through the air, and
lighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in
the centre.
"You have not allowed for the wind, Hubert," said his antagonist, bending his bow, "or that had been a better shot."
So saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause
upon his aim, Locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot
his arrow as carelessly in appearance as if he had not even
looked at the mark. He was speaking almost at the instant
that the shaft left the bowstring, yet it alighted in the target
two inches nearer to the white spot which marked the centre
than that of Hubert.
Hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the caution
which he had received from his adversary, he made the necessary allowance for a very light air of wind which had just arisen,
and shot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the target.
"A Hubert! a Hubert!" shouted the populace, more interested in a known person than in a stranger. "In the clout!in the clout!-a Hubert for ever!"
"Thou canst not mend that shot, Locksley," said the prince,
with an insulting smile.
" I will notch his shaft for him, however," replied Locksley.
And letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than
before, it lighted right upon that of his competitor, which it
split to shivers.
The people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful dexterity, that they could not even give vent to their
surprise in their usual clamor. " This must be the devil, and no
man of flesh and blood," whispered the yeomen to each other;
"such archery was never seen since a bow was first bent in
Britain."
"And now," said Locksley, " I will crave your grace's permission to plant such a mark as is used in the North Country,
and welcome every brave yeoman who shall try a shot at it to
win a smile from the bonny lass he loves best."
He then turned to leave the lists. "Let your guards attend
me," he said, " if you please-I go but to cut a rod from the
next willow bush."
Prince John made a signal that some attendants should folROBIN HOOD.
255THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
low him in case of his escape; but the cry of "Shame! shame!"
which burst from the multitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.
Locksley returned almost instantly with a willow-wand about
six feet in length, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a
man's thumb. He began to peel this with great composure,
observing, at the same time, that to ask a good woodsman to
shoot at a target so broad as had hitherto been used was to put
shame upon his skill. "For his own part," he said, " and in
the land where he was bred, men would as soon take for their
mark King Arthur's round-table, which held sixty knights
around it. A child of seven years old," he said, "might hit
yonder target with a headless shaft; but," added he, walking
deliberately to the other end of the lists, and sticking the willow-wand upright in the ground, "he that hits that rod at
five-score yards, I call him an archer fit to bear both bow and
quiver before a king, an it were the stout King Richard
himself."
"My grandsire," said Hubert, "drew a good bow at the
battle of Hastings, and never shot at such a mark in his lifeand neither will I. If this yeoman can cleave that rod, I give
him the bucklers-or rather, I yield to the devil that is in his
jerkin, and not to any human skill; a man can but do Ihis best,
and I will not shoot where I am sure to miss. I might as well
shoot at the edge of our parson's whittle, or at a wheat straw,
or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I can
hardly see."
"Cowardly dog!" said Prince John. "Sirrah Locksley, do
thou shoot; but if thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art
the first man ever did so. Howe'er it be, thou shalt not crow
over us with a mere show of superior skill."
" I will do my best, as Hubert says," answered Locksley;
"no man can do more."
So saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion
looked with attention to his weapon, and changed the string,
which he thought was no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former shots. He then took his aim with
some deliberation, and the multitude awaited the event in
breathless silence. The archer vindicated their opinion of his
skill; his arrow split the willow-rod against which it was aimed.
A jubilee of acclamations followed; and even Prince John, in
admiration of Locksley's skill, lost for an instant his dislike to
his person. "These twenty nobles," he said, " which, with the
bugle, thou hast fairly won, are thine own; we will make them
256OLIVER TWIST.
fifty, if thou wilt take livery and service with us as a yeoman
of our body-guard, and be near to our person; for never did so
strong a hand bend a bow, or so true an eye direct a shaft."
"Pardon me, noble prince," said Locksley; "but I have
vowed, that if ever I take service it should be with your royal
brother King Richard. These twenty nobles I leave to Hubert,
who has this day drawn as brave a bow as his grandsire did at
Hastings. Had his modesty not refused the trial, he would
have hit the wand as well as I."
Hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the
bounty of the stranger; and Locksley, anxious to escape farther
observation, mixed with the crowd, and was seen no more.
Oliver Twist.-DICKENs.
IN-a handsome room-though its furniture had rather the
air of old-fashioned comfort than of modern elegance-there
sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles,
dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his station some half way
between the sideboard and the breakfast-table, and with his
body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and
his right hand thrust into his waistcoat, while his left hung
down by his side grasping a waiter, looked like one who labored
under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.
Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years, but the
high-backed oaken chair in which she sat was not more upright
than she. Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision in a
quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the
old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat in a stately
manner with her hands folded on the table before her, and her
eyes, of which age had dimmed but little of their brightness,
attentively fixed upon her young companion.
The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time
of womanhood; at that age when, if ever angels be for God's
good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be without
impiety supposed to abide in such as hers.

MODULATION.
Modulation is the giving to each tone of the voice its
appropriate character and expression.
This all-important branch of elocution cannot be taught
by arbitrary rules.
The modulation of the voice in the expression of emotion
or passion, must be prompted by nature, to become intelligible and effective in the delivery. Anger, fear, joy,
grief, love, or any other passion, naturally suggest appropriate tones, and the necessary varied modulation of the
voice will follow when we feel these passions or emotions.
The use of modulation is not confined to the more vehement
passions; some kind of feeling or expression accompanies all
language, and this feeling has its proper expression.

XXxiliTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
She was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite
a mould, so mild and gentle, so pure and beautiful, that earth
seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions. The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye
and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her
age or of the world, and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humor, the thousand lights that played about
the face and left no shadow there; above all, the smile-the
cheerful, happy smile-were entwined with the best sympathies
and affections of our nature.
She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table, and
chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her,
playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her
forehead, and threw into one beaming look such a gush of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have
smiled to look upon her.
The elder lady smiled; but her heart was full, and she
brushed away a tear as she did so.
"And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?"
asked the old lady after a pause.
"An hour and twelve minutes, ma'am," replied Mr. Giles,
referring to a silver watch which he drew forth by a black
ribbon.
"He is always slow," remarked the old lady.
"Brittles always was a slow boy, ma'am," replied the attendanlt. And seeing, by-the-by, that Brittles had been a slow boy
for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability
of his ever being a fast one.
" He gets worse instead of better, I think," said the elder lady.
"It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any
other boys," said the young lady, smiling.
MIr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to
the garden gate, out of which there jumped a fat gentleman,
who ran straight up to the door, and getting quickly into the
house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and.
nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together.
"I never heard of such a thing!" exclaimed the fat gentleman. " My dear Mrs. Maylie-bless my soul-in the silence of
night too-I never heard of such a thing!"
With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman
shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired
how they found themselves.
"You ought to be dead--positively dead with the fiight,"
258OLIVER TWIST.
said the fat gentleman. Why didn't you send? Bless me, my
man should have come in a minute, or I myself and my assistant would have been delighted, or anybody: I'm sure, under
circumstances; dear, dear-so unexpected-in the silence of
night too!"
The doctor seemed especially. troubled by the fact of the
robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the nighttime, as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the
house-breaking way to transact business at noon, and to make
an appointment by the twopenny post a day or two previous.
"And you, Miss Rose," said the doctor, turning to the young
lady, "I"" Oh! very much so, indeed," said Rose, interrupting him;
"but there is a poor creature up stairs whom aunt wishes you
to see."
"Ah! to be sure," replied the doctor, "so there is.  That
was your handiwork, Giles, I understand."
Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to
rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honor.
"Honor, eh?" said the doctor; " well, I don't know, perhaps
it's as honorable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your
man at twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you've
fought a duel, Giles."
Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an
unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully,
that it was not for the like of him to judge about that, but he
rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party.
" Gad, that's true! " said the doctor. "Where is he? Show
me the way. I'll look in again as I come down, Mrs. Maylie.
That's the little'window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn't
have believed it."  Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles
up stairs; and while he is going up stairs the reader may be
informed that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighborhood,
known through a circuit of ten miles round as "the doctor,'
had grown fat more from good humor than from good living,
and was as kind. and hearty, and withal as. eccentric an old
bachelor as will be found in five times that space by any explorer alive.
The doctor was absent much longer than either he or the
ladies had anticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the
gig, and a bed-room bell was rung very often, and the servants
ran up and down stairs perpetually, from which tokens it was
justly concluded that something important was going on above.
At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after
259THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
his patient, looked very mysterious, and closed the door calefully.
"This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie," said the
doctor, standing with his back to the door as if to keep it shut.
"He is not in danger, I hope?" said the old lady.
"Why, that would not be an extraordinary thing, under the
circumstances," replied the doctor, " though I don't think he
is. Have you seen this thief?"
"No," rejoined the old lady.
"Nor heard anything about him?"
it No."
"I beg your pardon, ma'am," interposed Mr. Giles; "but I
was going to tell you about him when Dr. Losberne came in."
The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not at first been able to
bring his mind to the avowal that he had only shot a boy.
Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that
he could not for the life of him help postponing the explanation
for a few delicious minutes, during which he had flourished in
the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage.
"Rose wished to see the man," said Mrs. Maylie, "but I
wouldn't hear of it."
"Humph!" rejoined the doctor.   "There's nothing very
alarming in his appearance.  Have you any objection to see
him in my presence?"
"If it be necessary," replied the old lady, " certainly not."
"Then I think it is necessary," said the doctor; "at all
events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it.  He is perfectly quiet and
comfortable now. Allow me-Miss Rose, will you permit me?
not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honor."
With many more loquacious assurances that they would be
agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor
drew the young lady's arm through one of his, and offering his
disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them with much ceremony
and stateliness up stairs.
" Now," said the doctor in a whisper, as he softly turned the.
handle of a bed-room door, "let us hear what you think of
him. He has not been shaved very recently, but he doesn't
look at all ferocious notwithstanding. Stop, though: let me
see that he is in visiting order first."
Stepping before them, he looked into the room, and motioning them to advance, closed the door when they had entered,
and gently drew back the curtains of the bed. Upon it, in
lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to
260OLIVER TWIST.
behold, there lay a mere child, worn with pain and exhaustion,
and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound a-nd
splintered up, was crossed upon his breast, and his head reclined upon the other, which was half hidden by his long hair
as it streamed over the pillow.
The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked
on for a minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the
patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating
herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver's hair from
his face, and as she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his
forehead.
The boy stirred and smiled in his sleep, as though these
marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant
dream of a love and affection he had never known; as a strain
of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or
the odor of a flower, or even the mention of a familiar word,
will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that
never were, in this life, which vanish like a breath, and which
some brief memory of a happier existence long gone by, would
seem to have awakened, for no power of the human mind can
ever recall them.
"What can this mean?" exclaimed the elder lady. "This
poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers."
" Vice," sighed the surgeon, replacing the curtain, "takes up
her abode in many temples, and who can say that a fair outside
shall not enshrine her?"
"But at so early an age," urged Rose.
"My dear young lady," rejoined the surgeon, mournfully
shaking his head, " crime, like death, is not confined to the old
and withered alon'. The youngest and fairest are too often its
chosen victims.'
"But, can you-oh, sir! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts
of society?" said Rose, anxiously.
The surgeon shook his head in a manner which intimated that
he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might
disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.
" But even if he has been wicked," pursued Rose, "think
how young he is; think that he may never have known a
mother's love, or even the comfort of a home, and that ill-usage
and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd
with the men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt,
for mercy's sake think of this before you let them drag this
sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of
261THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
all his chances of amendment. Oh, as you love me, and know
that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and
affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been
equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity
upon him before it is too late!"
"My dear love!" said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, " do you think I would harm a hair of
his head?"
" Oh, no i" replied Rose, eagerly, " not you, aunt, not you!"
No," said the old lady, with a trembling lip, "my days are
drawing to their close, and may mercy be shown to me as I
show it to others. What can I do to save him, sir?"
" Let me think, ma'am," said the doctor, "let me think."
Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets and took
several turns up and down the room, often stopping and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully. After various
exclamations of "I've got it now," and "No, I haven't," and
as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length
made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:
"I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to
bully Giles and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. He
is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can
make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being
such a good shot besides. You don't object to that?"
"Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,"
replied Mrs. Maylie.
"There is no other," said the doctor. "No other, take my
word for it."
"Then aunt invests you with full power," said Rose, smiling
through her'tears; " but pray don't be harder upon the poor
fellows than is indispensably necessary."
"You seem to think," retorted the doctor, "that everybody
is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day except yourself. I only
hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you
may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the
very first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion;
and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself on
the spot of such a favorable opportunity for doing so, as the
present."
" You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself," returned
Rose, blushing.
"Well," said the doctor, laughing heartily, "that is no very
difficult matter. But to return to this boy: the great point of
our agreement is yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so,

I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable fellow down stairs that he mustn't be moved or spoken

out danger. Now, I make this stipulation-that I shall examine him in your presence, and that if, from what he says, we
judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason,
that he is a real and thorough bad one, (which is more than
possible,) he shall be left to his fate, without any further interference, on my part at all events."
"Oh, no, aunt!" entreated Rose.
"Oh, yes, aunt!" said the doctor. "Is it a bargain?"
"He cannot be hardened in vice," said Rose; "it is impossible."
"Very good," retorted the doctor; "then so much the more
reason for acceding to my proposition."
Finally the treaty was entered into, and the parties th.ereto
sat down to wait with some impatience until Oliver should wake.
The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a
longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect, for hour
after hour passed on, and still-Oliver slumbered heavily. It
was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought
them the intelligence that he had at length roused sufficiently
to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from
loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to
disclose something, that he deemed it better, to give him the opportunity than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next
morning, which he should otherwise have done.
The conference was a long one, for Oliver told them all his
simple history, and was often compelled to stop by pain and
want of strength. It was a solemn thing to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary
catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought
upon him. Oh! if, when we oppress and grind our fellowcreatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences
of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds are rising
slowly, it is true, but not less surely, to heaven, to pour their
after-vengeance on our heads-if we heard but one instant in
imagination the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which no
power can stifle and no pride shut out, where would be the
injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong,
that each day's life brings with it?
Oliver's pillow was smoothed by woman's hands that night,
and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept. He felt
calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur.

American and European Interests.-WEBsTER.
THE striking attitude, too, in which we stand to the world
around us-a topic to which, I fear, I advert too often,'and
dwell on too long-cannot be altogether omitted here. Neither
individuals nor nations can perform their part well, until they
understand and feel its importance, and comprehend and justly'
appreciate all the duties belonging to it. It is not to inflate
national vanity, nor to swell a light and empty feeling of selfimportance; but it is that we may judge justly of our situation,
and of our own duties, that I earnestly urge this consideration
of our position, and our character, among the nations of the
earth. It cannot be denied, but by those who would dispute
against the sun, that with America, and in America, a new era
commences in human affairs. This era is distinguished by free
representative governments, by entire religious liberty, by improved systems of national intercourse, by a newly awakened
and an unconquerable spirit of free inquiry, and by, a diffusion
of knowledge through the community, such as has been before
altogether unknown and unheard of. America, America, our
country, fellow-citizens, our own dear and native land, is insep.
arably connected, fast bound up, in fortune, and by fate, with
these great interests. If they fall, we fall with them; if they
stand, it will be because we have upholden them. Let us contemplate, then, this connection, which binds the prosperity of
others to our own; and let us manfully discharge all the duties
which it imposes. If we cherish the virtues and the principles
of our fathers, Heaven will assist us to carry on the work of human liberty and human happiness. Auspicious omens cheer us.
Great examples are before us. Our own firmament now shines
brightly upon our path. Washington is in the clear upper sky.
Other stars have now joined the American constellation; they
circle round their centre, and the heavens beam with new light.
Beneath this illumination, let us walk the course of life, and at
its close devoutly commend our beloved country, the commo:a
parent of us all, to the Divine bLnignity.

Death of the Flowers.-BR-YANT.
THE melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,
Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere.
Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead:
They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread.
The robin and the wren axe flown, and from the shrub the jay,
And from the wood-top calls the crow, through all the gloomy day.
Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprung and stood
In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?
Alas! they all are in their graves, the gentle race of flowers
Are lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and good of ours.
The rain is falling where they lie; but the cold November rain
Calls not, from out the gloomy earth, the lovely ones again.
The wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago,
And the wild-rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow;
But on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood,
And the yellow sun-flower by the brook in autumn beauty stood,
Till fell tile frost from the clear, cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,
And the brightness of their smile was gone from upland, glade and glen.
And now, when comes the calm, mild day, as still such days will come,
To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home,
When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,
And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,
The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,
And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.
And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,
The fair, meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side;
In the cold moist earth we laid her when the forest cast the leaf,
And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief;
Yet not unmeet it was, that one, like that young friend of ours
So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.
The Power of Legal Eloquence.-oRIGINAL.
ON the successful application of Legal Eloquence very frequently depends the fortunes, the character and the life of
clients. Let us take a scene from every-day life, where the influence of Legal Eloquence may be witnessed in all the majesty
of its power. You have been spectators in the solemn court
of justice, where the pallid prisoner at the bar awaited in feverish anxiety the fiat of LIFE, or DEATH, from the lips of hiq

fellow man! You have listened to the accumulative mass of
evidence, that left no doubt of the guilt of the accused. And
you have felt that no hope of escape remained for the hapless
culprit! The natural sympathies of the heart yearned in commiseration, at the apparent certain doom of the criminal. You
cast a hurried glance at the men, on whose decision the wretched
victim of the law is to be acquitted or condemned, Alas!
there is no hope from them. You read it intuitively in the
firm and compressed lips; in the rigidity of those stern muscles, that they intend conscientiously to fulfil their solemn oath,
which compels an unwilling verdict against the prisoner! But
see! the counsellor for the accused rises for the DEFENSE. The
silence of the grave is not more profound than the stillness
which now reigns in that crowded hall!
The able advocate has been carefully studying the whole
scene, with his wary eye and the tact of an experienced artist.
Its light and shade, its groupings, its prominent points, and its
minor accessories, ALL, ALL are noted by him.  The chief
object of his scrutiny, however, has been that JURY Box! Not
a face there has escaped his analyzation; not a heart there
into which he has not been studying how to make a successful
lodgment, by the aid of that eloquence which heretofore has
proved a MASTER KEY in his all-skilful hand! How subdued and
deprecating are the tones in which he commences his exordium;
and how deep is the look of sterner determination on the faces
of those twelve judges appointed by the law! He notes this
with his practised eye, and at once assumes a firmness of tone
and a sternness of demeanor in unison with their own. He
boldly combats the evidence, point by point, with all the skill
of experienced legal acumen; slurring over all that bears conclusively on his client, and arraying, in broad relief, the doubtful
and extenuating points. You have followed the able counsellor,
with earnest interest, until doubt after doubt has been dispelled.  AGAIN, yOU cast your eyes to THAT JURY Box,

INDECISION is stamped upon their countenances.  The able
advocate now commences his peroration. His voice swells with
entreaty, or becomes tremulous with feeling. He appeals in
tones which strike on every heart, for that mercy which is the
attribute of Divinity. He pleads for a life which, taken, cannot
be recalled!  He invokes those TWELVE JUDGES as MEN, as

one moment, consign the prisoner; if they have a DOUBT, to give

are bathed in tears; sobs resound through the crowded hall;

to his dictation!
A   Tale of Terror.-PAU Louis COURIER.
I WAS once travelling in Calabria; a land of wicked people,
who, I believe, hate every one, and particularly the French;
the reason why, would take long to tell you, suffice it to say
that they mortally hate us, and that one gets on very badly
when one falls into their hands. I had for a companion a
young man with a face-my faith, like the gentleman that we saw
at Kincy; you remember? and better still perhaps-I don't say
so to interest you, but because it is a fact. In these mountains
the roads are precipices; our horses got on with much difficulty; my companion went first; a path which appeared to
him shorter and more practicable led us astray. It was my
fault. Ought I to have trusted to a head only twenty years old?
Whilst daylight lasted we tried to find our way through the
wood, but the more we tried, the more bewildered we became,
and it was pitch dark when we arrived at a very black-looking
house. We entered, not without fear, but what could we do?
We found a whole family of colliers at table; they immediately
invited us to join them; my young man did not wait to be
pressed: there we were eating and drinking; he at least, for I
was examining the place and the appearance of our hosts. Our
hlosts had quite the look of colliers, but the house you would
have taken for an arsenal; there was nothing but guns, pistols,
swords, knives and cutlasses. Everything displeased me, and I
saw very well that I displeased them. My companion, on the
contrary, was quite one of the family, he laughed and talked
with them, and with an imprudence that I ought to have foreseen, (but to what purpose, if it was decreed,) he told at once
where we came from, where we were going, and that we were
Frenchmen. Just imagine! amongst our most mortal enemies,
alone, out of our road, so far froin all human succor! and then,
267The mind must be disciplined to a keen perception of the
sense, the force and the beauty of language, and the whole
soul must be attuned, as it were, tc the embodiment of every
shade that occurs in the delineation of passion or emotion.
The speaker or reader who does not acquire this varied
and expressive modulation of the voice, will fail to produce
due impression upon his auditors, however correct may be
his articulation, inflection and emphatic stresses.
Monotony is a fault always held unpardonable in a
speaker, for it invariably excites impatience and disgust.
Practice on examples embracing varieties of expression,
will enable the speaker to attain correct modulation, and if
this exercise is conducted under the supervision and instruction of an able teacher, the attainment of the qualification becomes more rapid and satisfactory. A good model
in this branch of elocutionary study seems almost indispensable.
With modulation, changes of tone and changes in delivery are connected. In the commencement of a new
sentence generally, and frequently in the same sentence,
a marked variety of tone is essential.  " Opposition,
variety, modification of the sense, interruption of the
thought, whether in one sentence or in separate sentences, produce a change of key."
Passionate composition requires more frequent changes
of the key, than argument.
The great fundamental rule for all modulation, is to
throw ourselves with perfect sincerity into the character of

XXXivTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
to omit nothing that might ruin us, he played the rich man,
promised to give the next morning, as a remuneration to these
people, and to our guides, whatever they wished. Then he
spoke of his portmanteau, begging them to take care of it, and
to put it at the head of his bed; he did not wish, he said, for
any other pillow. Oh, youth, youth, you are to be pitied!
Cousin, one would have thought we carried the crown diamonds.
What caused him so much solicitude about this portmanteau
was his mistress's letters. Supper over, they left us. Our hosts
slept below, we in the upper room, where we had supped. A
loft raised some seven or eight feet, which was reached by a
ladder, was the resting-place that awaited us; a sort of nest,
into which we were to introduce ourselves by creeping under
joists loaded with provisions for the year. My companion
climbed up alone, and already nearly asleep, laid himself down
with his head upon the precious portmanteau. Having determined to sit up, I made a good fire, and seated myself by the
side of it. The night, which had been undisturbed, was nearly
over, and I began to reassure myself; when, about the time that
I thought the break of day could not be very far off, I heard
our host and his wife talking and disputing below; and putting
my ear to the chimney which communicated with the one in the
lower room, I perfectly distinguished these words spoken by the
husband: "Well, let us see, must they both be killed?"  To
which the wife replied, " Yes;" and I heard no more. How
shall I go on? I stood scarcely breathing, my body cold as
marble; to have seen me, you could hardly have known if I
were alive or dead. Good Heavens! when I think of it now!
-We two almost without weapons, against twelve or fifteen
who had so many! and my companion dead with sleep and
fatigue! To call him, or make a noise, I dared not; to escape
alone was impossible; the window was not high, but below
were two large dogs howling like wolves. In what an agony I
was, imagine if you can. At the end of a long quarter of an
hour, I heard some one on the stairs, and, through the crack of
the door, I saw the father, his lamp in one hand, and in the
other one of his large knives. He came up, his wife after him,
I was behind the door; he opened it, but before he came in he
put down the lamp, which his wife took. He then entered,
barefoot, and from outside the woman said to him, in a low
voice, shading the light of the lamp with her hand, " Softly, go
softly."  When he got to the ladder, he mounted it, his knife
between his teeth, and getting up as high as the bed-the poor
young man lying with his throat bare-with one hand he took
268THE CHARIOT RACE.
his knife, and with the other-Oh! cousin-he seized a ham,
which hung from the ceiling, cut a slice from it, and retired as
he had come. The door was closed again, the lamp disappeared, and I was left alone with my reflections.
As soon as day appeared, all the family making a great noise
came to awaken us as we had requested. They brought us
something to eat, and gave us a very clean, and a very good
breakfast, I assure you. Two capons formed part of it, of which
we must, said our hostess, take away one and eat the other.
When I saw them, I understood the meaning of those terrible
words, "Must they both be killed?" and I think, cousin, you
have enough penetration to guess now what they signified.
Oblige me, cousin, do not tell this story. In the first place,
as you see, I do not play a good part in it; next, you would
spoil it. Stay, I do not flatter you, but your face would destroy
the effect of my tale. Without boasting, I have just the countenance to relate a fearful story. But as for you, if you wish
to tell a story, choose a subject that suits your face-Psyche,
for example.

THEY took their stand, where the appointed judges
Had cast their lots and ranged the rival cars.
Rang out the brazen trump! Away they bound.
Cheer the hot steeds and shake the slackened reins;
As with a body, the large space is filled
With the huge clangor of the rattling cars:
High whirl aloft the dust-clouds; blent together
Each presses each-and the lash rings-and loud
Snort the wild steeds, and from their fiery breath,
Along their manes, and down the circling wheels,
Scatter the flaking foam. Orestes still,

The left rein curbed--that on the dexter hand
Flung loose. So on erect the chariots rolled!

Broke from the bit-and, as the seventh time now

Europe and America.-WEBsTER.
IN many respects, sir, the European and the American nations are alike.  They are alike Christian states, civilized states,
and commercial states. They have access to the same common
fountains of intelligence; they all draw from those sources
which belong to the whole civilized world. In knowledge and
letters-in the arts of peace and war-they differ in degrees,
but they bear, nevertheless, a general resemblance. On the
other hand, in matters of government and social institution, the
nations on this continent are founded upon principles which
never did prevail, in considerable extent, either at any other
time, or in any other place.  There has never been presented
to the mind of man a more interesting subject of contemplation
271THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
than the establishment of so many nations in America, partaking
in the civilization and in the arts of the Old World, but having
left behind them those cumbrous institutions which had their
origin in a dark and military age. Whatsoever European experience has developed favorable to the freedom and the happiness
of man; whatsoever European genius has invented for his improvement or gratification; whatsoever of refinement or polish
the culture of European society presents for his adoption and
enjoyment-all this is offered to man in America, with the additional advantages of the full power of erecting forms of government on free and simple principles, without overturning institutions suited to times long passed, but too strongly supported,
either by interests or prejudices, to be shaken without convulsions. This unprecedented state of things presents the happiest
of all occasions for an attempt to establish national intercourse
upon improved principles; upon principles tending to peace and
the mutual prosperity of nations. In this respect America, the
whole of America, has a new career before her. If we look
back on the history of Europe, we see how great a portion of
the last two centuries her states have been at war for interests
connected mainly with her feudal monarchies; wars for particular dyhasties; wars to support or defeat particular successions;
wars to enlarge or curtail the dominions of particular crowns;
wars to support or to dissolve family alliances; wars, in fine, to
enforce or to resist religious intolerance. What long and bloody
chapters do these not fill, in the history of European politics!
Who does not see, and who does not rejoice to see, that America has a glorious chance of escaping, at least, these causes of
contention? Who does not see, and who does not rejoice to
see, that, on this continent, under other forms of government,
we have before us the noble hope of being able, by the mere
influence of civil liberty and religious toleration, to dry up these
outpouring fountains of blood, and to extinguish these consuming
fires of war. The general opinion of the age favors such hopes
and such prospects. There is a growing disposition to treat the
intercourse of nations more like the useful intercourse of friends;
philosophy-just views of national advantage, good sense, and
the dictates of a common religion, and an increasing conviction
that war is not the interest of the human race-all concur to
increase the interest created by this new accession to the list of
nations.
272MARK ANTONY'S ORATION.
Brutus's Oration.-SH   AKESPEARE.
ROMANS, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my cause;
and be silent, that you may hear: believe me for mine honor;
and have respect to mine honor, that you may believe: censure
me in your wisdom; and awake your senses, that you may the
better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend
of Ceesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Cwesarwas no less
than his. If then that friend demand, why Brutus rose against
Caesar, this is my answer-Not that I loved Caesar less, but that
I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen?
As Cwesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I
rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him: but, as he was
ambitious, I slew him. There is tears, for his love; joy, for his
fortune; honor, for Ihis valor; and death, for his ambition. Who
is here so base, that would be a bondman?  If any, speak; for
him have I offended. Who is here so rude, that would not be
a Roman?    If any, speak; for him have I offended. -Who is
here so vile, that will not love his country? If any, speak; for
him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Ceesar,
than you should do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not extenuated, wherein he was
worthy; nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who, though
he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as which of you shall not?
With this, I depart; That, as I slew my best lover for the good
of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall
please my country to need my death.
Mark Antony's Oration.-SH     AKrSEAUE.
FRIENDS, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears:
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil, that men do, lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you, Caesar was ambitious:
12*
273THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIS'T.
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Caesar answered it.
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest,
(For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men;)
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says, he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Cwesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Cresar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see, that on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition 8
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause;
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him I
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason!-Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent;
That day he overcame the Nervii--
Look! in this place, ran Cassius' dagger through:
See, what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stabbed;
And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it;
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
Judge, 0 you gods, how dearly Ca3sar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all:
For when the noble Coesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitor's arms,
Quite vanquished him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
Which all the while ran blood, great Cesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen I
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.

0, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep you, when you but behold
Our CEesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marred, as you see, by traitors.
They, that have done this deed, are honorable;
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do't; they are wise and honorable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no oratorl, as Brutus is:
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend; and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him.
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
I tell you that, which you yourselves do know:
Show you sweet Ceesar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me: But were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
In every wound of CEesar, that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
The Literature of the Age of Elizabeth.-HAzLITT.
THE literature of this age then, I would say, was strongly
influenced, (among other causes,) first by the spirit of Christianity, and secondly by the spirit of Protestantism.
The effects of the Reformation on politics and philosophy
may be seen in the writings and history of the next and of the
following ages. They are still at work, and will continue to be
so.  The effects on the poetry of the time were chiefly confined
to the moulding of,the character, and giving a powerful impulse to the intellect of the country. The immediate use or
application that was made of religion to subjects of imagination
and fiction was not (from an "bvious ground of separation) so
direct or frequent, as that which was made of the classical and
romantic literature.
For, much about the same time, the rich and fascinating
stores of the Greek and Roman mythology, and those of the
romantic poetry of Spain and Italy, were eagerly explored by
the curious, and thrown open in translations to the admiring
gaze of the vulgar. This last circumstance could hardly have
afforded so much advantage to the poets of that day, who wereTHE PRACTIOAL ELOCUTIONIST.
themselves, in fact, the translators, as it shows the general curiosity and increasing interest in such subjects as a prevailing
feature of the times. There were translations of Tasso by Fairfaix, and of Ariosto by Harrington, of Homer and Hesiod by
Chapman, and of Virgil long before, and Ovid soon after; there
was Sir Thomas North's translation of Plutarch, of which Shakspeare has made such admirable use in his Coriolanus and Julius
Caesar; and Ben Jonson's tragedies of Cataline and Sejanus
may themselves be considered as almost literal translations into
verse of Tacitus, Sallust, and Cicero's Orations in his consulship. Petrarch, Dante, the satirist Aretine, Machiavel, Castiglion, and others, were familiar to our writers, and they make occasional mention of some few French authors, as Ronsard and Du
Bartas; for the French literature had not at this stage arrived
at its Augustan period, and it was the imitation of their literature a century afterwards, when it had arrived at its greatest
height, (itself copied from the Greek and Latin,) that enfeebled
and impoverished our own. But of the time that we are considering it might be said, without much extravagance, that every
breath that blew, that every wave that rolled to our shores,
brought with it some new accession to our knowledge, which
was engrafted on the national genius.
What also gave an unusual impetus to tlle mind of men at
this period was the discovery of the New World, and the reading of voyages and travels. Green islands and golden sands
seemed to arise, as by enchantment, out of the bosom of the
watery waste, and invite the cupidity, or wing the imagination
of the dreaming speculator. Fairy-land was realized in new
and unknown worlds. " Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales, thrice happy isles," were found floating, "like those
Hesperian gardens famed of old," beyond Atlantic seas, as dropt
from the zenith. The people, the soil, the clime, everything
gave unlimited scope to the curiosity of the traveller and reader.
Other manners might be said to enlarge the bounds of knowledge, and new mines of wealth were tumbled at our feet. It is
from a voyage to the Straits of Magellan that Shakspeare has
taken the hint of Prospero's Enchanted Island, and of the savage Caliban with his god Setebos. Spenser seems to have
had the same feeling in his mind in the production of his Faery
Queen.
Fancy's air-drawn pictures are after history's waking dream
276THE LITERATURE OF THE AGE OF ELIZABETH. 277
showed like clouds over mountains; and from the romance of
real life to the idlest fiction the transition seemed easy. Shakspeare, as well as others of his time, availed himself of the old
chronicles, and of the traditions or fabulous inventions contained
in them in such ample measure, and which had not yet been appropriated to the purposes of poetry or the drama. The stage
was a new thing; and those who had to supply its demands laid
their hands upon whatever came within their reach; they were
not particular as to the means, so that they gained the end.
Lear is founded upon an old ballad; Othello on an Italian novel;
Hamlet on a Danish, and Macbeth on a Scotch tradition; one
of which is to be found in Saxo-Grammaticus, and the last in
Hollinshed. The ghost-scenes and the witches in each are
authenticated in the old Gothic history. There was also this
connecting link between the poetry of this age and the supernatural traditions of a former one, that the belief in them was
still extant, and in full force and visible operations among the
vulgar (to say no more) in the time of our authors. The appalling and wild chimeras of superstition and ignorance, "those
bodiless creations that ecstasy is very cunning in," were interwoven with existing manners and opinions, and all their effects
on the passions of terror or pity might be gathered from common and actual observation-might be discerned in the workings
of the face, the expressions of the tongue, the writhings of a
troubled conscience. "Your face, my Thane, is as a book
where men may read strange matters." Midnight and secret
murders too, from the imperfect state of the police, were more
common; and the ferocious and brutal manners that would
stamp the brow of the hardened ruffian or hired assassin, more
incorrigible and undisguised; the portraits of Tyrrel and Forrest were, no doubt, done from the life. We find that the ravages of the plague, the destructive rage of fire, the poisoned
chalice, lean famine, the serpent's mortal sting, and the fury of
wild beasts were the common topics of their poetry, as they
were common occurrences in more remote periods of history.
They were the strong ingredients thrown into the cauldron of
tragedy, to make it "thick and slab."  Man's life was (as it
appears to me) more full of traps and pitfalls; of hair-breadth
accidents by flood and field; more waylaid by sudden and startling evils; it trod on the brink of hope and fear; stumbled upon
fate unawares; while the imagination, close behind it, caught at,
and clung to, the shape of danger, or "snatched a wild and
fearful joy" from its escape. The accidents of nature were less
provided against; the excesses of the passions and of lawlessINTRODUCTION.                   xxxv
the language; be earnest, forcible and expressive, and we
shall persuade or convince at will. Imitative modulation
is a great power in the hands of a skillful speaker or reader.
Not only may we convey to our hearers, in reading especially, our own feelings of the beauty and force of language,
by a corresponding tone and modulation, but even particular words acquire a double force of expression by the use of
imitative modulation, presenting to the mind of the hearer
a succession of pictures descriptive of the sense, simply by
tones. In poetical reading and recitation, the use of imitative modulation is peculiarly striking. We embody, as it
were, the descriptions created by the author vividly ancl
palpably to the hearer.
GESTURE.
Gesticulation should not be left only to the impulse of
the speaker, at the moment of delivery. Feeling will.oubtless suggest appropriate action, when that feeling is
regulated by a cultivated and refined taste. Yet good
models may be consulted with advantage, and a few general principles may be applied, for the acquirement of easy
rnd graceful action.
Theatrical and overstrained action should be avoided.

power were less regulated, and produced more strange and desperate catastrophes. The tales of Boccaccio are founded on the
great pestilence of Florence, Fletcher, the poet, died of the
plague, and Marlow was stabbed in a tavern quarrel. The
strict authority of parents, the inequality of ranks, or the hereditary feuds between different families, made more unhappy
loves or matches.
"' The course of true love never did run even."
Again, the heroic and martial spirit which breathes in our
elder writers was yet in considerable activity in the reign of
Elizabeth. "The age of chivalry was not then quite gone, nor
the glory of Europe extinguished forever." Jousts and tournaments were still common with the nobility in England and in
foreign countries; Sir Philip Sidney was particularly distinguished for his proficiency in these exercises, (and indeed fell a
martyr to his ambition as a soldier,) and the gentle Surrey was
still more famous, on the same account, just before him.  It is
true, the general use of fire-arms gradually superseded the necessity of skill in the sword, or bravery in the person; and as a
symptom of the rapid degeneracy in this respect, we find Sir
John Suckling soon after boasting of himself as one"Who prized black eyes, and a lucky hit
At bowls, above all the trophies of wit."
It was comparatively an age of peace,
"Like strength reposing on his own right arm;"
but the sound of civil combat might still be heard in the distance, the spear glittered to the eye of memory, or the clashing of armor struck on the imagination of the ardent and the
young.
A  Romance about Milton.-s i WILLIAM JONES.
I SET out in the morning, in company with a friend, to visit a
place where Milton spent some part of his life, and where, in all
probability, he composed several of his earliest productions. It
is a small village, situated on a pleasant hill, about three miles
278A ROMANCE ABOUT MILTON.
from Oxford, and called Forest-Hill, because it formerly lay
contiguous to a forest, which has since been cut down.    The
poet chose this place of retirement after his first marriage, and
he describes the beauty of his retreat in that fine passage of his
L'Allegro.
" Sometimes walking not unseen,
By hedge-row elms, or hillocks green.
While the ploughman, near at hand,
Whistles o'er the furrowed land,
And the milkmaid singeth blithe,
And the mower whets his scythe;
And every shepherd tells his tale,
Under the hawthorn in the dale.
Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures,
While the landscape round it measures.
Russet lawns, and fallows gray,
Where the nibbling flocks do stray;
Mountains, on whose barren breast
The lab'ring clouds do often rest;
Meadows trim, with daisies pied,
Shallow brooks and rivers wide;
Towers and battlements it sees,
Bosom'd high in tufted trees.
*      *      *      *
Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes,
From betwixt two aged oaks," &amp;c.
It was neither the proper season of the year, nor time of the
day, to hear all the rural sounds and see all the objects mentioned in this description; but by a pleasing concurrence of
circumstances, we were saluted, on our approach to the village,
with the music of the mower and his scythe; we saw the ploughman intent upon his labor, and the milkmaid returning from her
country employment.
As we ascended the hill, the variety of beautiful objects, the
agreeable stillness and natural simplicity of the whole scene,
gave us the highest pleasure. We at length reached the spot
whence Milton undoubtedly took most of his images; it is on the
top of the hill, from which there is a most extensive prospect on
all sides; the distant mountains that seemed to support the
clouds, the villages and turrets, partly shaded by trees of the
finest verdure, and partly raised above the groves that surrounded them, the dark plains and meadows, of a grayish color,
where the sheep were feeding at large; in short, the view of the
streams and rivers, convinced us that there was not a single useless or idle word in the above-mentioned description, but that it
279THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
was a most exact and lively representation of nature. Thus will
this fine passage, which has always been admired for its elegance,
receive an additional beauty from its exactness. After we had
walked, with a kind of poetical enthusiasm, over this enchanted
ground, we returned to the village.
The poet's house was close to the church; the greatest part
of it has been pulled down, and what remains, belongs to an adjacent farm. I am informed that several papers in Mvlilton's own
hand were found by the gentleman who was last in possession
of the estate. The tradition of his having lived there is current
among the villagers; one of them showed us a ruinous wall that
made part of his chamber; and I was much pleased with another, who had forgotten the name of Milton, but recollected
him by the title of the poet.
It must not be omitted, that the groves near this village are
famous for nightingales, which are so elegantly described in the
Penseroso. Most of the cottage-windows are overgrown with
sweetbriers, vines, and honeysuckles; and that Milton's habitation had the same rustic ornament, we may conclude from his
description of the lark bidding him good-morrow:
"Through the sweetbrier, or the vine,
Or the twisted eglantine,"
for it is evident that he meant a sort of honeysuckle by the eglantinle, though that word is commonly used for the sweetbrier,
which he could not mention twice in the same couplet. If I
ever pass a month or six weeks at Oxford, in the summer, I shall
be inclined to hire and repair this venerable mansion, and to
make a'festival for a circle of friends, in honor of Milton, the
most perfect scholar, as well as the sublimest poet, that our
country ever produced.
Thanatopsis.-B RYANT.
To him who, in the love of Nature, holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language. For his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty; and she glides
Into his darker musiigs with a mild

And gentle sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make tlhee to shudder, and grow sick at heartGo forth unto the open sky, and list
To Nature's teachings, while from all around--
Earth and her waters, and the depths of airComes a still voice-Yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding sun shall see no more
In all his course. Nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;
And lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix forever with the elements,
To be a brother to the insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.
Yet not to thy etetnal resting-place
Shalt thou retire alone; nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world-with kings,
The powerful of the earth-the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills,
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun; the vales,
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods; rivers that move
In majesty; and the complaining brooks,
That make the meadow green; and poured round all,
Old Ocean's gray and melancholy wasteAre but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
Of morning, and the Barcan desert pierce;
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save his own dashings; yet-the dead are there;
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep-the dead reign there alone.
So shalt, thou rest; and what if thou fall
Unnoticed by the living, and no friend
281THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Take note of thy departure B All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one, as before, will chase
His favorite phantom! yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come,
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron, and maid,
The bowed with age, the infant, in the smiles
And beauty of its innocent age cut offShall, one by one, be gathered to thy side,
By those, who, in their turn, shall follow them.
So live, that, when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon; but, sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
The   Tragedy     of the Pyrenees.-R. MONoKTON MILNES
THE marriage blessing on their brows,
Across the Channel seas
And lands of gay Garonne, they reach
The pleasant Pyrenees--
He, into boyhood born again,
A son of joy and lifeAnd she a happy English girl,
A happier English wife.
They loiter not where Argeles,
The chestnut-crested plain
Unfolds its robe of green and gold
In pasture, grape, and grain;
But on and up, where Nature's heart
Beats strong amid the hills,
They pause, contented with the wealth
l'hat either bosoms fills.
There is a lake, a small round lake,
High on the mountain's breast,
The child of rains and melted snows,
The torrent's summer rest282THE TRAGEDY OF THE PYRENEES.
A mirror where the veteran rocks
May glass their peaks and scars,
A nether sky where breezes break
The sunlight into stars.
Oh! gaily shone that little lake,
And Nature, sternly fair,
Put on a sparkling countenance
To greet that merry pair;
How light from stone to stone they leaped,
How trippingly they ran;
To scale the rock and gain the marge
Was all a moment's span!
"See, dearest, this primeval boat,
So quaint and rough, I deem
Just such an one did Charon ply
Across the Stygian stream:

And you a Spirit boldI was a famous rower once
In college days of old.

So blithe and sweet a strain,
That the long-silent cliffs were glad
To peal it back again.

And.rose in careless pride,
And swayed in cadence to the song,
The boat from side to side;
Then, clasping hand in loving hand,
They danced a childish round,
And felt as safe in that mid-lake
As on the firmest ground.
One poise too much 1--He headlong fellShe, stretching out to save
A feeble arm, was borne adown

Of music-mingled laughterThe struggling splash and deathly shriek
Were there the instant after.
Her weaker head above the flood,
That quick engulfed the strong,
Like some enchanted water-flower,
Waved pitifully long283THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Long seemed the low and lonely wail
Athwart the tide to fade;
Alas I that there were some to hear,
But never one to aid.
Yet not, alas I if Heaven revered
The freshly-spoken vow,
And willed that what was then made one
Should not be sundered nowIf she was spared, by that sharp stroke,
Love's most unnatural doom,
The future lorn and unconsoled,
The unavoided tomb!
But weep, ye very rocks! for those,
Who, on their native shore,
Await the letters of dear news,
That shall arrive no more;
One letter from a stranger hand
Few words are all the need;
And then the funeral of the heart,
The course of useless speed!
The presence of the cold dead wood,
The single mark and sign
Of her so loved and beautiful,
That handiwork divine!
The weary search for his fine form
That in the depth would linger,
And late success-Oh! leave the riag
Upon that faithful finger.
And if in life there lie the seed
Of real enduring beingIf love and truth be not decreed
To perish unforeseeingThis youth, the seal of death has stampt,
Now time can wither never,
This hope, that sorrow might have dampt,
Is fresh and strong for ever.
The Murder and the Murderer's Doom.-wEBSTER.
AN aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his own
house, and in his own bed, is made the victim of a butcherly
murder, for mere pay. Truly, here is a new lesson for painters
and poets.  Whoever shall hereafter draw the portrait of murder, if he will show it as it has been exhibited in an example,
284THE MURDER AND THE MURDERER'S DOOM.               285
where such example was last to have been looked for, in the
very bosom of our New England society, let him not give it the
grim visage of Moloch, the brow knitted by revenge, the face
black with settled hate, and the bloodshot eye emitting livid
fires of malice. Let him draw, rather, a decorous, smooth-faced,
bloodless demon; a picture in repose, rather than in action; not
so much an example of human nature, in its depravity, and inits paroxysms of crime, as an infernal nature, a fiend, in the ordinary display and development of his character.
The deed was executed with a degree of self-possession and
steadiness, equal to the wickedness with which it was planned.
The circumstances, now clearly in evidence, spread out the
whole scene before us. Deep sleep had fallen on the destined
victim, and on all beneath his roof. A healthful old man, to
whom sleep was sweet, the first sound slumbers of the night
held him in their soft but strong embrace. The assassin enters,
through the window already prepared, into an unoccupied
apartment. With noiseless foot he paces the lonely hall, half
lighted by the moon; he winds up the ascent of the stairs, and
reaches the door of the chamber. Of this, he moves the lock,
by soft and continued pressure, till it turns on its hinges without
noise; and he enters, and beholds his victim before him. The
room was uncommonly open to the admission of light. The
face of the innocent sleeper was turned from the murderer, and
the beams of the moon, resting on the gray locks of his aged
temple, showed him where to strike. ~ The fatal blow is given!
and the victim passes, without a struggle or a motion, from the
repose of sleep to the repose of death! It is the assassin's purpose to make sure work; and he yet plies the dagger, though
it was obvious that life had been destroyed by the blow of the
bludgeon. He even raises the aged arm, that he may not fail
in his aim at the heart, and replaces it again over the wounds
of the poniard! To finish the picture, he explores the wrist for
the pulse! He feels for it, and ascertains that it beats no
longer! It is accomplished. The deed is done. He retreats,
retraces his steps to the window, passes out through it as he
came in, and escapes. He has done the murder-no eye has
seen him, no ear has heard him. The secret is his own, and it
is safe!
Ahb! gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret
can be safe nowhere. The whole creation of God has neither
nook nor corner, where the guilty can bestow it, and say it is safe.
Not to speak of that eye which glances through all disguises,
and beholds everything, as in the splendor of noon-suchTHE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even by men.
True it is, generally speaking, that "murder will out."  True
it is, that Providence hath so ordained, and doth so govern
things, that those who break the great law of heaven, by shedding man's blood, seldom succeed in avoiding discovery. Especially in a case exciting so much attention as this, discovery
must come, and will come sooner or later. A thousand eyes
turn at once to explore every man, everything, every circumstance connected with the time and place; a thousand ears
catch every whisper; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell
on the scene, shedding all their light, and ready to kindle the
slightest circumstance into a blaze of discovery. Meantime, the
guilty soul cannot keep its own secret. It is false to itself; or
rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to
itself. It labors under its guilty possession, and knows not
what to do with it. The human heart was not made for the
residence of such an inhabitant. It finds itself preyed on by a
torment, which it dares not acknowledge to God nor man. A
vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance, either from heaven or earth. The secret which the murderer possesses soon comes to possess him, and like the evil
spirits of which we read, it overcomes him, and leads him whithersoever it will. He feels it beating at his heart, rising to his
throat, and demanding disclosure. He thinks the whole world
sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and almost hears its
workings in the very silence of his thoughts. It has become
his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence. When suspicions, from without,
begin to embarrass him, and the net of circumstance to entangle
him, the fatal secret struggles with still greater violence to burst
forth. It must be confessed, it will be confessed, there is no
refuge from confession but suicide, and suicide is confession.
Avalanches of the Jungfrau.-G. B. CHEEVER.
ORDINARILY, in a sunny day at noon, the avalanches are falling
on the Jungfrau about every ten minutes, with the roar of thunder, but they are much more seldom visible, and sometimes the
traveller crosses the Wengern Alp without witnessing them at
all. But we were so very highly favored as to see two of the
286AVALANCHES OF THE JUNGFRAU.
grandest avalanches possible in the course of about an hour,
between twelve o'clock and two. One cannot command any
language to convey an adequate idea of their magnificence. You
are standing far below, gazing up to where the great disc of the
glittering Alp cuts the heavens, and drinking in the influence
of the silent scene around. Suddenly an enormous mass of
snow and ice, in itself a mountain, seems to move; it breaks
from the toppling outmost mountain ridge of snow, where it is
hundreds of feet in depth, and in its first fall of perhaps two
thousand feet, is broken into millions of fragments. As you
first see the flash of distant artillery by night, then hear the
roar, so here you may see the white flashing mass majestically
bowing, then hear the astounding din. A cloud of dusty, misty,
dry snow rises into the air from the concussion, forming a white
volume of fleecy smoke, or misty light, from the bosom of which
thunders forth the icy torrent in its second prodigious fall over
the rocky battlements. The eye follows it delighted as it ploughs
through the path which preceding avalanches have worn, till it
comes to the brink of a vast ridge of bare rock, perhaps more
than two thousand feet perpendicular. Then pours the whole
cataract over the gulf with a still louder roar of echoing thunder,
to which nothing but the noise of Niagara in its sublimity is
comparable. Nevertheless, you may think of the tramp of an
army of elephants, of the roar of multitudinous cavalry marching to battle, of the whirlwind tread of ten thousand bisons
sweeping across the prairie, of the tempest surf of ocean beating and shaking the continent, of the sound of torrent floods or of
a numerous host, or of the voice of the Trumpet on Sinai, exceeding loud, and waxing louder and louder, so that all the people
in the camp trembled, or of the rolling orbs of that fierce chariot
described by Milton,
"Under whose burning wheels
The steadfast empyrean shook throughout."
It is with such a mighty shaking tramp that the avalanche down
thunders. Another fall of still greater depth ensues, over a
second similar castellated ridge or reef in the face of the mountain, with an awful majestic slowness, and a tremendous crash,
in its concussion, awakening again the reverberating peals of
thunder. Then the torrent roars on to another smaller fall, till
at length it reaches a mighty groove of snow and ice, like the
slide down the Pilatus, of which Playfair has given so powerfully
graphic a description. Here its progress is slower, and last of
28'the hips. Avoid all angularity of action. Stand firm,
with the chest expanded and the head erect, and even in
the strongest efforts of passionate declamation you will
avoid ungraceful and overstrained action.

INTRODUCTION.THE PRACTICAL, ELOCUTIONIST.
all you listen to the roar of the falling fragments as they drop
out of sight with a dead weight into the bottom of the gulf, to
rest there for ever. Now figure to yourself a cataract like that
of Niagara, (for I should judge the volume of one of these avalanches to be probably every way superior in bulk to the whole
of the Horse-shoe fall,) poured in foaming grandeur, not merely
over one great precipice of two hundred feet, but over the successive ridgy precipices of two or three thousand, in the face of
a mountain eleven thousand feet high, and tumbling, crashing,
thundering down, with a continuous din of far greater sublimity
than the sound of the grandest cataract. Placed on the slope
of the Wengern Alp, right opposite the whole visible side of the
Jungfrau, we have enjoyed two of these mighty spectacles, at
about half an hour's interval between them. The first was the
most sublime, the second the most beautiful. The roar of the
falling mass begins to be heard the moment it is loosened from
the mountain; it pours on with the sound of a vast body of
rushing water; then comes the first great concussion, a booming
crash of thunders, breaking on the still air in mid-heaven; your
breath is suspended as you listen and look; the mighty glittering
mass shoots headlong over the main precipice, and the fall is so
great that it produces to the eye that impression of dread majestic slowness, of which I have spoken, though it is doubtless
more rapid than Niagara. But if you should see the cataract
of Niagara itself coming down five thousand feet above, you in
the air, there would be the same impression. The image remains in the mind, and can never fade from it; it is as if you
had seen an alabaster cataract from heaven.

ABOU Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace.
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel, writing in a book of gold;
Exceediing peace had made Ben Adhem bold:
And to the presence in the room he said,
"What writest thou?" The vision raised its head,
And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, " The names of those who love the Lord."
"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerily still; and said, " I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men."
The angel wrote and vanished. The next night
It came again, with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,
And, lo I Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.

Excellence the Reward of       Labor.-wIRT.
THE education, gentlemen, moral and intellectual, of every
individual, must be, chiefly, his own work.  Rely upon it, that
the ancients were right-Quisque sutce fortunce faber-both in
morals and intellect, we give their final shape to our own characters, and thus become, emplhatically, the architects of our own
fortunes.  How else could it happen, that youngg men, who have
had precisely the same opportunities, should be continually presenting us with such different results, and rushing to such
opposite destinies? Difference of talent will not solve it, because
that difference is very often in favor of tl-e disappointed candidate.  You shall see issuing from the walls of the same college
-nay, sometimes firom the bosom of the same family-two young
men, of whom the one shall be admitted to be a genius of high
order, the other, scarcely above the point of mediocrity; yet you
shall see the genius sinking and perishing in poverty, obscurity
and wretchedness; while on the other hand, you shall observe
the mediocre plodding his slow but sure way up the hill of life,
gaining steadfalst footing at every step, and mounting, at length,
to eminence and distinction, an ornament to his family, a blessing
to his country.  Now, whose work is this?    Manifestly their
own. They are the architects of their respective fortunes. The
best seminary of learning that can open its portals to you, can
do no more than to afford you the opportunity of instruction;
but it must depend, at last, on yourselves, whether you will be
instructed or not, or to what point you will push your instruction.  And of this be assured-I speak, from    observation, a
certain truth-there is no excellence without great labor.  It is

the condor of South America, pitches from the summit of Chimborazo, above the clouds, and sustains itself, at pleasure, in that

exertion-this vigorous power of profound and searching investigation-this careering and wide-spreading comprehension of
mind-and those long reaches of thought, that
" Pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
Where fathom line could never touch the ground,

Christianity the True Source of Reform.-CHAPMn.
THE great element of Reform is not born of human wisdom;
it does not draw its life from human organizations.  I find it
only in CHRITIANITY. "Thy kingdom come!" There is a sublime and pregnant burden in this prayer. It is the aspiration
of every soul that goes forth in the spirit of Reform. For
what is the significance of- this prayer? It is a petition that all
holy influences would penetrate and subdue and dwell in the
heart of man, until he shall think, and speak, and do good,
from the very necessity of his being. So would the institutions
of error and wrong crumble and pass away. So would sin die

with the Divine Will, this earth would become like Heaven.
It is too late for the Reformers to sneer at Christianity-it is
foolishness for them to reject it. In it are enshrined our faith
in human progress-our confidence in Reform. It is indissolhibly connected with all that is hopeful, spiritual, capable in man.
That men have mis muderstood it and perverted it, is true. But

come out of it--have been based upon it. Is it not so? Come,
ye remembered ones, who sleep the sleep of the just, who took
your conduct from the line of Christian philosophy-come from
your tombs, and answer!
Come Howard, from the gloom of the prison and the taint of
the lazar-house, and show us what Philanthropy can do when
imbued with the spirit of Jesus. Come Eliot, from the thick
forest where the red-man listens to the Woord of Life-come
Penn, from thy sweet counsel and weaponless victory; and
show us what Christian zeal and Christian love can accomplish
with the rudest barbarians or the fiercest hearts. Come Riakes,
from thy labors with the ignorant and the poor, and show us
with what an eye this faith regards the lowest and least of our
race, and how diligently it labors, not for the body, not for the
rank, but for the plastic soul that is to course the ages of immortality.
And ye, who are a great number-ye nameless ones-who
have done good in your narrower spheres, content to forego renown on earth, and seeking your reward in the record on
high, come and tell us how kindly a spirit, how lofty a purpose,
or how strong a courage, the religion ye professed can breathe
into the poor, the humble, and the weak.
Go forth, then, Spirit of Christianity, to thy great work of
REFORM! The Past bears witness to thee in the blood of thy
martyrs, and the ashes of thy saints and heroes. The Present
is hopeful because of thee. The Future shall acknowledge thy
omnipotence.
The Destruction of the Philistines.-M    ILTo N.
OCCASIONS drew me early to this city;
And, as the gates I entered with sunrise,
The morning trumpets festival proclaimed
Through each high street; little I had despatched,
When all abroad was rumored that this day
Samson should be brought forth, to show the people
Proof of his mighty strength in feats and games
I sorrowed at his captive state, but minded
Not to be absent at that spectacle.
The building was a spacious theatre
Half round, on two main pillars vaulted high,
293294            TIIE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
With seats wllere all the lords, and each degree
Of sort, might sit in order to behold;
The other side was open, where the throng
On banks and scaffolds under sky might stand;
I among these aloof obscurely stood.
The feast and noon grew high, and sacrifice
Had filled their hearts with mirth, high cheer, and wine,
When to their sports they turned. Immediately
Was Samson as a public servant brought,
In their state livery clad; before him pipes,
And timbrels, on each side went armed guards,
Both horse and foot, before him and behind
Archers, and slingers, cataphracts and spears.
At sight of him the people with a shout
Rifted the air, clamoring their god with praise,
Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.
Ie, patient, but undaunted, where they led him,
Came to the place; and what was set before him,
Which without help of eye might be assayed,
To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still performed
All with incredible, stupendous force;
None daring to appear antagonist.
At length for intermission's sake they led him
Between the pillars; he his guide requested
(For so from such as nearer stood we heard)
As over-tired to let him lean a while
With both his arms on those two massy pillars
That to the arched roof gave main support.
He, unsuspicious, led him; which when Samson
Felt in his arms, with head awhile inclined,
And eyes fast fixed, he stood, as one who prayed,
Or some great matter in his mind revolved;
At last with head erect thus cried aloud,
"Hitherto, lords, what your commands imposed
I have performed, as reason was, obeying,
Not without wonder or delight beheld;
Now of my own accord such other trial
I mean to show you of my strength, yet greater,
As, with amaze shall strike all who behold."
This uttered, straining all his nerves, he bowed,
As, with the force of winds and waters pent,
When mountains tremble: those two massy pillars
With horrible convulsion to and fro
He tugged, he shook, till down they came and drew
The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder
Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,
Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,
Their choice nobility and flower, not only
Of this, but each Philistian city round,
Met from all parts to solemnize this feast.
Samson, with these immixed, inevitably
Pulled down the same destruction on himself;
The vulgar only'scaped, who stood without.THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.
The Day of Judgment.-JERE1Y TAYLOR.
EVEN you and I, and all the world, kings and priests, nobles
and learned, the crafty and the easy, the wise and the foolish,
the rich and the poor, the prevailing tyrant and the oppressed
party, shall all appear to receive their symbol; and this is so
far from abating anything of its terror and our dear concernment, that it much increases it. For although concerning precepts and discourses we are apt to neglect in particular what is
recommended in general, and in incidences of mortality and sad
events, the singularity of the chance heightens the apprehension
of the evil; yet it is so by accident, and only in regard of our imperfection; it being an effect of self-love, or some little creeping
envy, which adheres too often to the unfortunate and miserable;
or being apprehended to be in a rare case, and a singular unworthiness in him who is afflicted otherwise than is common to
the sons of men, companions of his sin, and brethren of his
nature, and partners of his usual accidents; yet in final and
extreme events, the multitude of sufferers does not lessen, but
increase the sufferings; and when the first day of judgment happened, that, I mean, of the universal deluge of waters upon the
old world, the calamity swelled like the flood, and every man
saw his friend perish, and the neighbors of his dwelling, and the
relatives of his house, and the sharers of his joys, and yesterday's bride, and the new-born heir, the priest of the family, and
the honor of the kindred, all dying or dead, drenched in water
and the divine vengeance; and then they had no place to flee
unto, no man cared for their souls; they had none to go unto
for counsel, no sanctuary high enough to keep them from the
vengeance that rained down from heaven; and so it shall be at
the day of judgment, when that world and this, and all that
shall be born hereafter, shall pass through the same Red Sea,
and be all baptized with the same fire, and be involved in the
same cloud, in which shall be thunderings and terrors infinite.
Every man's fear shall be increased by his neighbor's shrieks,
and the amazement that all the world shall be in, shall unite as
the sparks of a raging furnace into a globe of fire, and roll upon
its own principle, and increase by direct appearances and intolerable reflections. And that shriek must needs be terrible,
when millions of men and women, at the samle instant, shall
fearfully cry out, and the noise shall mingle with the trumpet
of the archangel, with the thunders of the dying and groaning heavens, and the crack of the dissolving world, when the
295THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
whole fabric of nature shall shake into dissolution and eternal
ashes!
Consider what an infinite multitude of angels, and men, and
woimen, shall then appear!  It is a huge assembly when the
men of one kingdom, the men of one age in a single province,
are gathered together into heaps and confusion of disorder;
but then, all kingdoms of all ages, all the armies that ever mustered, all that world that Augustus Ccesar taxed, all those hundreds of millions that were slain in all the Roman wars, from
Numa's time till Italy was broken into principalities and small
exarchates; all these, and all that can come into numbers, and
that did descend from the loins of Adam, shah at once be represented; to which account, if we add the armies of heaven, the
nine orders of blessed spirits, and the infinite numbers in every
order, we may suppose the numbers fit to express the majesty
of that God, and the terror of that Judge, who is the Lord and
Father of all that unimaginable multitude! * * The majesty
of the Judge, and the terrors of the judgment, shall be spoken
aloud by the immediate forerunning accidents, which shall be so
great violences to the old constitutions of nature, that it shall
break her very bones, and disorder her till she be destroyed.
Saint Jerome relates out of the Jews' books, that their doctors
used to account fifteen days of prodigy immediately before
Christ's coming, and to every day assign a wonder, any one of
which, if we should chance to see in the days of our flesh, it
would affright us into the like thoughts which the old world
had, when they saw the countries round about them  covered
with water and the divine vengeance; or as those poor people
near Adria and the Mediterranean Sea, when their houses and
cities were- entering into graves, and the bowels of the earth
rent with convulsions and horrid tremblings. The sea, they
say, shall rise fifteen cubits above the highest mountains, and
thence descend into hollowness and.~ prodigious drought; and
when they are reduced again to their usual proportions, then all
the beasts and creeping things, the monsters and the usual
inhabitants of the sea, shall be gathered together, and make
fearful noises to distract mankind: the birds shall mourn and
change their song into threnes and sad accents; rivers of fire
shall rise from east to west, and the stars shall be rent into
threads of light, and scatter like the beards of comets; then
shall be fearful earthquakes, and the rocks shall rend in pieces,
the trees shall distil blood, and the mountains and fairest structures shall return into their primitive dust; the wild beasts shall
leave their dens, and shall come into the companies of men, so

that you shall hardly tell how to call them, herds of men or
congregations of beasts; then shall the graves open and give up
their dead, and those which are alive in nature and dead in fear
shall be forced from the rocks whither they went to hide them,
and from caverns of the earth where they would fain have been
concealed; because their retirements are dismantled, and their
rocks are broken into wider ruptures, and admit a strange light
into their secret bowels; and the men being forced abroad into
the theatre of mighty horrors, shall run up aid down distracted,
and at their wit's end; and then some shall die, and some shall
be changed; and by this time the elect shall be gathered togeth'er from the four quarters of the world, and Christ shall
come along with them to judgment.
Bernardo Del Carpio.-IH         EMANs.
THE warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his heart of fire,
And sued the haughty king to free his long-imprisoned sire;
" I bring thee here my fortress keys, I bring my captive train,
I pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord!-oh! break my father's chain I"'Rise, rise! even now thy father comes, a ransomed man this day;
Mount thy good horse, and thou and I will meet him on his way."
Then lightly rose that loyal son, an-d bounded on his steed,
And urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy speed.
And lo! from far, as on they preesed, there came a glittering band,
With one that'midst them stately rode, as a leader in the land;
" Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very truth, is he,
The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so long to see."
His dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his cheek's blood came
and went;
He reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and there, dismounting, bent;
A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he tookWhat was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook.
That hand was cold-a frozen thing-it dropped from his like leadHe looked up to the face above-the face was of the dead!
A plume waved o'er the noble brow-the brow was fixed and white;He met at last his father's eyes-but in them was no sight!
Up from the ground he sprung, and gazed, but who could paint that gaze I
They hushed their very hearts, that saw its horror and amazo;

For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the blood.

Story of Le.Fevre.-ST     ERNE.
IT was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the ashes out of
his third pipe that Co(rporal Trim  returned from the inn, and
gave him the following account.
I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring
back your honor any kind of intelligence concerning the poorl
sick lieutenant.  Is he in the army, then? said my uncle Toby.
He is, said the corporal.  And in what regiment? said my uncle
Toby. I'll tell your honor, replied the corporal, everything
straightforwards as I learned it.  Then, Trim, I'll fill another
298STORI OF LE FEVRE.
pipe, said my uncle Toby, and not interrupt thee till thou hast
done; so sit down at thy ease, Trim, in the window seat, and
begin thy story again. The coriporal made his old bow, which
generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak it-Your honor
is good. And having done that, he sat down, as he was ordered;
and begun the story to my uncle Toby over again in pretty near
the same words.
I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring
back any intelligence to your honor about the lieutenant and his
sqn; for when I asked where his servant was, from whom I
made myself sure of knowing everything which was proper to
be asked-That's a right distinction, Trim, said my uncle TobyI was answered, an' please your honor, that he had no servant
with him; that he had come to the inn with hired horses, which,
apon finding himself unable to proceed, (to join, I suppose, the
regiment,) he had dismissed the morning after he came. If I
get better, my dear, said he, as he gave his purse to his son to
pay the man, we canll hire horses from hence. But, alas! the
poor gentleman will never get fiom hence, said the landlady to
me; for I heard the death-watch all night long; and when he
dies, the youth, his son, will certainly die with him; for he is
broken-hearted alieady.
I was hearing this account, continued the corporal, when the
youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toast the landlord
spoke of. But I will do it for my father myself, said the youth.
Pray, let me save you the trouble, young gentleman, said I,
taking up a fork for the purpose, and offering him my chair to
sit down upon by the fire whilst I did it. I believe, sir, said he,
very modestly, I can please him best myself. I am sure, said
I, his honor will not like the toast the worse for being toasted
by an old soldier. The youth took hold of my hand, and instantly burst into tears. Poor youth! said nay uncle Toby; he
has been bred up from an infant in the army, and the name of
a soldier, Trim, sounded in his ears like the name of a friend; I
wish I had him here.
I never, in the longest march, said the corporal, had so great
mind to my dinner, as I had to cry with him for company.
What could be the matter vith me, an' please your honor?
Nothing in the world, Trim, said my uncle Toby, blowing his
aose; but that thou art a good-natured fellow.
WMhen I gave him the toast, continued the corporal, I thought
it was proper to tell him I was Captain Shandy's servant, an(d
that your honor, though a stranoger, was extremely concerned
for his father; and that, if there was anything in your house
299THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
or cellar-And thb:u might'st have added my purse too, said my
uncle Toby-he was heartily welcome to it. He made a very
low bow, which was meant to your honor; but no answer, for
his heart was full; so he went up stairs with the toast. I warrant you, my dear, said I, as I opened the kitchen door, your
father will be well again. Mr. Yorick's curate was smoking a
pipe by the kitchen fire, but said not a word, good or bad, to
comfort the youth. I thought it wrong, added the corporal.
I: think so too, said my uncle Toby.
When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast, he
felt himself a little revived, and sent down into the kitchen to
let me know that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I
would step up stairs. I believe, said the landlord, he is going
to say his prayers, for there was a book laid upon the chair by
his bedside, and as I shut the door, I saw his son take up a
cushion.
I thought, said the curate, that you gentlemen of the army,
Mr. Trim, never said your prayers at all. I heard the poor
gentleman say his prayers last night, said the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed it.
Are you sure of it? replied the curate. A soldier, an' please
3your reverence, said I, prays as often of his own accord as a parson; and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life,
and for his honor too, he has the most reason to pray to God of
any one in the whole world.'Twas well said of thee, Trim, said
my uncle Toby. But when a soldier, said I, an' please your
reverence, has been standing for twelve hours together in the
trenches up to his knees in cold water, or engaged, said I, for
months together in long and dangerous marches; harassed, perhaps, in his rear to-day; harassing others to-morrow; detached
here; countermanded there; resting this night out upon his
arms; beat up in his shirt the next; benumbed in his joints;
perhaps without straw in his tent to kneel on; he must say his
prayers how and when he can. I believe, said I-for I was
piqued, quoth the corporal, for the reputation of the army-I
believe, an' please your reverence, said I, that when a soldier
gets time to pray, he prays as heartily as a parson, though not
with all his fuss and hypocrisy. Thou shouldst not have said
that, Trim, said my uncle Toby; for God only knows who is a
hlypocrite and who is not. At the great and general review of
us all, corporal, at the day of judgment, and not till then, it will
be seen who have done their duties in this world and who have
not; and we shall be advanced, Trim, accordingly. I hope we
shall, said Trim. It is in the Scripture, said my uncle Toby,
300STORY OF LE FEVRE.
and I will show it thee to-morrow. In the mean time, we may
depend upon it, Trim, for our comfort, said my uncle Toby, that
God Almighty is so good and just a governor of the world, that
if we have but done our duties in it, it will never be inquired
into whether we have done them in a red coat or a black one.
I hope not, said the corporal. But go on, Trim, said my uncle
Toby, with thy story.
When I went up, continued the corporal, into the lieutenant's
room, which I did not do till the expiration of the ten minutes,
he was lying in his bed with his head raised upon his hand, with
his elbow upon the pillow, and a clean white cambric handkerchief beside it. The youth was just stooping down to take up
the cushion, upon which I supposed he had been kneeling; the
book was laid upon the bed; and as he rose, in taking up the
cushion with one hand, he reached out his other to take it away
at the same time. Let it remain there, my dear, said the
lieutenant.
He did not offer to speak to me till I had walked up close to
his bedside. If you are Captain Shandy's servant, said he, you
must present my thanks to your master, with my little boy's
thanks along with them, for his courtesy to me. If he was of
Levens's, said the lieutenant. I told him your honor was. Then,
said he, I served three campaigns with him in Flanders, and remember him; but'tis most likely, as I had not the honor of any
acquaintance with him, that he knows nothing of me. You will
tell him, however, that the person his good-nature has laid under obligations to him is one Le Fevre, a lieutenant in Angus's.
But he knows me not, said he, a second time, musing. Possibly
he may my story, added he. Pray, tell the captain, I was the
ensign at Breda whose wife was most unfortunately killed with
a musket-shot as she lay in my arms in my tent. I remember
the story, an't please your honor, said I, very well. Do you so?
said he, wiping his eyes with his handkerchief, then well may I.
In saying this, he drew a little ring out of his bosom, which
seemed tied with a black ribbon about his neck, and kissed it
twice. Here, Billy, said he. The boy flew across the room to
the bedside, and falling down upon his knee, took the ring in
his hand; and kissed it too; then kissed his father, and sat down
upon the bed and wept.
I wish, said my uncle Toby, with a deep sigh-I wish, Trim,
I was asleep. Your honor, replied the corporal, is too much
concerned. Shall I pour your honor out a glass of sack to your
pipe? Do, Trim, said my uncle Toby.
I remember, said my uncle Toby, sighing again, the story of
301THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
the ensign and his wife, with a circumstance his modesty omritted; and particularly well that he, as well as she, upon some
account or other, I forget what, was universally pitied by the
whole regiment; but finish the story thou art upon. "l'is finished already, said the corporal, for I could stay no longer; so
wished his honor a good night. Young Le Fevre rose from off
the bed, and saw me to the bottom of the stairs; and as we
went down together, told me they had come from Ireland, and
were on their route to join their regiment in Flanders. But,
alas! said the corporal, the lieutenant's last day's march is over.
Then what is to become of his poor boy? cried my uncle Toby.
It was to my uncle Toby's eternal honor--though I tell it only
for the sake of those, who, when cooped in betwixt a natural
and a positive law, know not for their souls which way in the
world to turn themselves-that, notwithstanding my uncle Toby
was warmly engaged at that time in carrying on the siege of
Dendermond, parallel with the allies, who pressed theirs on so
vigorously that they scarce allowed him time to get his dinnerthat nevertheless he gave up Dendermond, though he had already made a lodgment upon the counterscarp--and bent his
whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn; and
except that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up, by
which he might be said to have turned the siege of Dendermond
into a blockade, he left Dendermond to itself, to be relieved or
not by the French king as the French king thought good, and
only considered how he himself should relieve the poor lieutenant and his son. That kind Being, who is a firiend to the
friendless, shall recompense thee for this.
Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle Toby to the
corporal, as he was putting him to bed; and I will tell thee in
what, Trim. In the first place, when thou mad'st an offer of
my services to Le Fevre-as sickness and travelling are both
expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor lieutenant, with
a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay-that thou
didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had he
stood in need, thou knowest, Trim, he had been as welcome to
it as myself. Your honor knows, said the corporal, I had no
orders. True, quoth my uncle Toby, thou didst very right, Trim,
as a soldier, but certainly very wrong as a man.
In the second place, for which indeed thou hast the same
excuse, continued my uncle Toby, when thou offeredst him whatever was in my house, thou shouldst have offered him my house
too. A sick brother officer should have the best quarters, Trim;
and if we had him with us, we could tend and look to him,
302STORY OF LE FEVRE.
Thou art an excellent nurse thyself, Trim; and what with thy
care of him, and the old woman's, and his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once, and set him upon
his legs. In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle Toby,
smiling, he might march. He will never march, an' please your
honor, in this world, said the corporal. He will march, said my
uncle Toby, rising up from the side of the bed with one shoe off.
An' please your honor, said the corporal, he will never march
but to his grave. He shall march, cried my uncle Toby, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without advancing an
inch--he shall march to his regiment. He cannot stand it, said
the corporal. He shall be supported, said my uncle Toby.
He'll drop at last, said the corporal; and what will become of
his boy? He shall not drop, said my uncle Toby, firmly.
A-well-o'-day, do what we can for him, said Trim, maintaining
his point, the poor soul will die. He shall not die, by G-,
cried my uncle Toby. The Accusing Spirit, which flew up to
heaven's chancery with the oath, blushed as he gave it in; and
the Recording Angel, as he wrote it down, dropped a tear upon
the word, and blotted it out for ever.
My uncle Toby went to his bureau; put his purse into his
breeches pocket; and having ordered the corporal to go early
in the morning for a physician, he went to bed, and fell asleep.
The sun looked bright the morning after, to every eye in the
village but Le Fevre's and his afflicted son's. The hand of death
pressed heavy upon his eyelids, and hardly could the wheel at
the cistern turn round its circle, when my uncle Toby, who had
rose up an hour before his wonted time, entered the lieutenant's
room, and without preface or apology sat himself down upon
the chair by the bedside; and independently of all modes and
customs, opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and
brother officer would have done it, and asked him how he didhow he had rested in the night-what was his complaint-where
was his pain-and what he could do to help him. And without giving him time to answer any one of the inquiries, went on
and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting
with the corporal the night before for him. You shall go home
directly, Le Fevre, said my uncle Toby, to my house, and we'll
send for a doctor to see what's the matter; and we'll have an.
apothecary, and the corporal shall be your nurse, and I'll be
your servant, Le Fevre.
There was a frankness in my uncle Toby--not the effect of
familiarity, but the cause of it-which let you at once into his
soul, and showed you the goodness of his nature; to this there
303THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
was something in his looks, and voice, and manner superadded,
which eternally beckoned to the unfortunate to come and take
shelter under him; so that before my uncle Toby had half finished the kind offers he was making to the father, had the son
insensibly pressed up close to his knees, and had taken hold of
the breast of his coat, and was pulling it towards him. The
blood and spirits of Le Fevre, which were waxing cold and slow
within him, and were retreating to their last citadel, the heart,
rallied back; the film forsook his eyes for a moment; he looked
up wishfully in my uncle Toby's face, then cast a look upon his
boy; and that ligament, fine as it was, was never broken. Nature instantly ebbed again; the film returned to its place; the
pulse fluttered-stopped-went on-throbbed--stopped again
-moved-stopped. Shall I go on?    No.
Our Treatment of the Indians.-H. CLAY.

of retaliation, enormities on the Indians. I will advance in support of this position, as applicable to all law, the principle, that
whatever has been the custom, from the commencement of a
subject, whatever has been the uniform usage coeval and
co-existent with the subject to which it relates, becomes its fixed
law. Such was the foundation of all common law; and such,
I believe, was the principal foundation of all public, or international law. If then, it can be shown that from the first settlement of the colonies on this part of the American continent,
to the present time, we have constantly abstained from retaliating upon the Indians the excesses practised by them towards
us; we are morally bound by this invariable usage, and cannot
lawfully change it without the most cogent reasons. So far as
my knowledge extends, from the first settlement at Plymouth
or at Jamestown, it has not been our practice to destroy Indian
captives, combatants or non-combatants. I know of but one deviation from the code which regulates the warfare between civilized communities; and that is the destruction of Indian towns;
which is supposed to be authorized upon the ground that we
cannot bring the war to a termination without destroying the
means which nourish it. With this single exception, the other
principles of the laws of civilized nations are extended to
304OUR TREATMENT OF THE INDIANS.
them, and are thus made law with regard to them. When did
this humane custom, by which, in consideration of their ignorance, and our enlightened condition, the rigors of war were
mitigated, begin?  At a time when we were weak, and they
were comparatively strong, when they were the lords of the
soil, and we were seeking, from the vices, from the corruptions,
from the religious intolerance, and from the oppressions of Europe, to gain an asylum among them. And when is it proposed
to change this custom, to substitute for it the bloody maxims
of barbarous ages, and to interpolate the Indian public law with
revolting cruelties? At a time when we are powerful and they
are weak: at a time when, to use a figure drawn from their own
sublime eloquence, the poor children of the forest have been
driven by the great wave which has flowed in from the Atlantic
Ocean almost to the base of the Rocky Mountains, and, overwhelming them in its terrible progress, has left no other remains
of hundreds of tribes now extinct, than those which indicate the
remote existence of their former companion, the Mammoth of
the New World! Yes, it is at this auspicious period of our
country, when we hold a proud and lofty station among the first
nations of the world, that we are called upon to sanction a departure from the established laws and usages which have regulated our Indian hostilities; and does the honorable gentleman
from Massachusetts expect, in this august body, this enlightened
assembly of Christians and Americans, by glowing appeals to
our passions, to make us forget our principles, our religion, our
clemency, and our humanity? Why is it that we have not
practised, toward the Indian tribes, the right of retaliation, now
for the first time asserted in regard to them? Because it is a
principle, proclaimed by reason, and enforced by every respectable writer on the law of nations, that retaliation is only justifiable as calculated to produce effect in the war. Vengeance is
a new motive for resorting to it. If retaliation will produce no
effect on the enemy, we are bound to abstain from it by every
consideration of humanity and justice. Will it, then, produce
effect on the Indian tribes? No; they care not about the execution of those of their warriors who are taken captive. These
are considered as disgraced by the very circumstance of their captivity; and it is often mercy to the unhappy captive, to deprive
him of his existence. The poet evinced a profound knowledge
of the Indian character, when he put into the mouth of the son
of a distinguished chief, about to be led to the stake and tortured by his victorious enemy, the words,
305THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
"Begin, ye tormentors! your threats are in vain:
The son of Alknomak will never complain."
Retaliation of Indian excesses, not producing then any effect
in preventing their repetition, is condemned both by reason and
the principles upon which alone, in any case, it can be justified.
On this branch of the subject, much more might be said, but,
as he should possibly again allude to it, he would pass from it,
for the present, to another topic.
NTapoleon Bonaparte.-PHILLIrs.
HE is fallen! We may now pause before that splendid prodigy, which towered amongst us like some ancient ruin, whose
frown terrified the glance its magnificence attracted. Grand,
gloomy, and peculiar, he sat upon the throne a sceptred hermit, wrapt in the solitude of his own originality. A mind,
bold, independent, and decisive-a will, despotic in its dictates
-an energy that distanced expedition, and a conscience pliable
to every touch of interest, marked the outline of this extraordinary character-the most extraordinary, perhaps, that in the
annals of this world ever rose, or reigned, or fell. Flung into
life in the midst of a revolution that quickened every energy of
a people who acknowledge no superior, he commenced his
course, a stranger by birth, and a scholar by charity! With no
friend but his sword, and no fortune but his talents, he rushed
in the list where rank, and wealth, and genius had arrayed
themselves, and competition fled from him as from the glance
of destiny. He knew no motive but interest-he acknowledged
no criterion but success-he worshipped no God but ambition,
and with an eastern devotion he knelt at the shrine of his idolatry. Subsidiary to this, there was no creed that he did not pro.
fess, there was no opinion that he did not promulgate; in the
hope of a dynasty, he upheld the crescent; for the sake of a
divorce, he bowed before the cross; the orphan of St. Louis, he
became the adopted child of the republic; and with a parricidal
ingratitude, on the ruins both of the throne and tribune he
reared the throne of his despotism. A professed Catholic, he

imprisoned the Pope; a pretended patriot, he impoverished the
country; and, in the name of Brutus, he grasped without remorse, and wore without shame, the diadem of the Cresars!
Through this pantomime of policy, fortune played the clown to
his caprices. At his touch, crowns crumbled, beggars reigned,
systems vanished, the wildest theories took the color of his
whim, and all that was venerable, and all that was novel,
changed places with the rapidity of a drama. Even apparent
defeat assumed the appearance of victory--his flight froIn Egypt
confirmed his destiny-ruin itself only elevated him to empire.
But if his fortune was great, his genius was transcendent; decision flashed upon hlis councils; and it was the same to decide
and to perform. To inferior intellects his combinations appeared
perfectly impossible, his plans perfectly impracticable; but in
his hands, simplicity marked their development, and success
vindicated their adoption. His person partook the character of
his mind-if the one never yielded in the cabinet, the other
never bent in the field. Nature had no obstacle that he did not
surmount-space no opposition that he did not spurn; and
whether amid Alpine rocks, Arabian sands, or Polar snows, he
seemed proof against peril, and empowered with ubiquity! The
whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity of his designs, and the miracle of their execution. Scepticism bowed to
the prodigies of his performance; romance assumed the air of
history; nor was there aught too incredible for belief, or too
fanciful for expectation, when the world saw a subaltern of Corsica waving his imperial flag over her most ancient capitals. All
the visions of antiquity became commonplaces in his contemplation; kings were his people-nations were his outposts; and he
disposed of courts, and crowns, and camps, and churches, and
cabinets, as if they were titular dignitaries of the chess-board!
Amid all these changes, he stood immutable as adamant.
It mattered little whether in the field or in the drawing-roomwith the mob or the levee-wearing the jacobin bonnet or the
iron crown-banishing a Braganza, or espousing a Hapsburgdicttting peace on a raft to the Czar of Russia, or contemplating
defeat at the gallows of Leipsig-he was still the same military
despot!
In this wonderful combination, his affectations of literature
must not be omitted. The gaoler of the press, he affected the
patronage of letters-the proscriber of books, he encouraged
philosophy-the persecutor of authors and the murderer of
printers, he yet pretended to the protection of learning! the
assassin of Palm, the silencer of De Stael, and the denouncer of:307PRE F ACE.
THE   very favorable reception my " SHAKSPEARIAN

induced me to meet another want in our stock of Educational Literature, the deficiency of which has, I believe)
been as generally experienced by teachers, as was the necessity for a revised text of Shakspeare, for the use of
schools.
My chief design in this work is, to furnish a collection
of examples for elocutionary practice, suited for advanced

ed men as such.    It is not in literary production oinly, or
chiefly, that educated mind finds fit expression, and fulfils its
mission in honor and beneficence.  In the great theatre of the
world's affairs, there is a worthy and a sufficient sphere. Society
needs the well-trained, enlarged and cultivated intellect of the
scholar, in its midst; needs it, and welcomes it, and gives it a
place, or, by its own capacity, it will take a place of honor,
influence, and power. The youthful scholar has no occasion to
deplore the fate that is soon to tear him from his studies, and
cast him into thle swelling tide of life and action. None of his
disciplinary and enriching culture will be lost, or useless, even
there.  Every hour of study, every truth he has reached,
and the toilsome process by which he reached it; the heightened grace or vigor of thought or speech he has acquired-all
shall tell fully, nobly, if he will give heed to the conditions.
And one condition, the prime one, is, that he be a true man,
and recognize the obligation of a man, and go forth with
heart, and will, and every gift and acquirement dedicated, lovingly and resolutely, to the true and the right. These are the
terms; and apart from these there is no success, no influence to
be had, which an ingenuous mind can desire, or which a sound
and far-seeing mind would dare to seek.
Indeed, it is not an easy thing, nay, it is not a possible thing,
to obtain a substantial success, and an abiding influence, except
on these terms. A factitious popularity, a transient no-toriety,
or, in the case of shining talents, the doom of a damning farme,
may fall to bad men. But an honored name, enduring influence, a sun brightening on through its circuit, more and more,
even to its serene setting-this boon of a true success goes
never to intellectual qualities alone. It gravitates slowly but
surely to weight of character, to intellectual ability root'ed in
principle.

WHAT is glory? What is fame?
The echo of a long-lost name;
A breath, an idle hour's brief talk
The shadow of an arrant naught;
A flower that blossoms for a day,
Dying next morrow:
A stream that hurries on its way,
Singing of sorrow;The last drop of a bootless shower,
Shed on a sere and leafless bower;
A rose, stuck in a dead man's breastThis is the world's fame at the best!
What is fame? and what is glory  
A dream-a jester's lying story,
To tickle fools withal, or be
A theme for second infancy;
A joke scrawled on an epitaph;
A grin at death's own ghastly laugh;
A visioning that tempts the eye,
But mocks the touch-non-entity;
A rainbow, substanceless as bright,
Flitting for ever
O'er hill-top to more distant height,
Nearing us never;
A bubble, blown by fond conceit,
In very sooth itself to cheat;
The witch-fire of a frenzied brain
A fortune that to lose were gain;
A word of praise, perchance of blame;
The wreck of a time-bandied nameAy, this is glory!-this is fame!
308THE MISERERE AT ROME.
The Miserere at Rome.-J. T. HEADLEY.
THE night on which our Saviour is supposed to have died is
selected for this service. The Sistine Chapel is dimly lighted,
to correspond with the gloom of the scene shadowed forth.....The ceremonies commenced with the chanting of the Lamentations. Thirteen'candles, in the form of an erect triangle, were
lighted up in the beginning, representing the different moral
lights of the ancient church of Israel. One after another was
extinguished as the chant proceeded, until the last and brightest
one at the top, representing C6hrist, was put out. As they one
by one slowly disappeared in the deepening gloom, a blacker
night seemed gathering over the hopes and fate of man, and the
lamentation grew wilder and deeper. But as the Prophet of
prophets, the Light, the Hope of the world disappeared, the
lament suddenly ceased. Not a sound was heard amid the
deepening gloom.  The catastrophe was too awful, and the
shock too great to admit of speech. He who had been pouring
his sorrowful notes over the departure of the good and great
seemed struck suddenly dumb at this greatest woe. Stunned
and stupefied, he could not contemplate the mighty disaster. I
never felt a heavier pressure on my heart than at this moment.
The chapel was packed in every inch of it, even out of the door
far back into the ample hall, and yet not a sound was heard. I
could hear the breathing of the mighty multitude, and amid it
the suppressed half-drawn sigh. Like the chanter, each man
seemed to say, " Christ is gone, we are orphans-all orphans!"
The silence at length became too painful. I thought I should
shriek out in agony, when suddenly a low wail, so desolate and
yet so sweet, so despairing and yet so tender, like the last strain
of a broken heart, stole slowly out from the distant darkness
and swelled over the throng, that the tears rushed unbidden to
my eyes, and I could have wept like a child in sympathy. It
then died away as if the grief were too great for the strain.
Fainter and fainter, like the dying tone of a lute, it sunk away
as if the last sigh of sorrow was ended, when suddenly there
burst through the arches a cry so piercing and shrill that it
seemed not the voice of song, but the language of a wounded
and dying heart in its last agonizing throb.  The multitude
swayed to it like the forest to the blast. Again it ceased, and
broken sobs of exhausted grief alone were heard. In a moment
the whole choir joined their lament and seemed to weep with
the weeper. After a few notes they paused again, and that
sweet, melancholy voice mourned on alone. Its note is still in

my ear.   I wanted to see the singer.     It seemed as if such
sounds could come from nothing but a broken heart.     Oh! how
unlike the joyful, the triumphant anthem that swept through the
same chapel on the morning that symbolized the resurrection.
A  Fragment.-FRANcEs KEMBLE BUTLER.
WALKING by moonlight on the golden margin
That binds the silver sea, I fell to thinking
Of all the wild imaginings that man
Hath peopled heaven, and earth, and ocean with;
Making fair nature's solitary haunts
Alive with beings, beautiful and fearful.
And as the chain of thought grew, link by link,
It seemed as though the midnight heavens waxed brighter,
The stars gazed fixedly with their golden eyes,
And a strange light played o'er each sleeping billow,
That laid its head upon the sandy beach.
Anon there calne along the rocky shore
A far-off sound of sweetest minstrelsy.
From no one point of heaven or earth it came:
But under, over, and about it breathed;
Filling my soul with thrilling, fearfull pleasure.
It swelled, as though borne on the floating wings
Of the midsumlner breeze; it died away
Towards heaven, as though it sank into the clouds,
That one by one melted like flakes of snow
In the moonbeams. Then came a rushing sound,
Like countless wings of bees, or butterflies;
And suddenly, as far as eye might view,
The coast was peopled with a world of elves,
Who in fantastic ringlets danced around,
With antic gestures, and wild beckoning motion,
Aimed at the moon. White was their snowy vesture,
And shining as the Alps, when that the sun
Gems their pale robes with diamonds. On their heads
Were wreaths of crimson and of yellow foxglove.
They were all fair, and light as dreams. Anon
The dance broke off; and sailing through the air,
Some one way, and some other, they did each
Alight upon some waving branch or flower
That garlanded the rocks upon the shore.
One chiefly did I mark; one tiny sprite,
Who crept into an orange flower-bell,
And there lay nestling, whilst his eager lips
Drank from its virgin chalice the night dew,
That glistened, like a pearl, in its white bosom.
310ACTS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.
Acts of the American Revolution.-JARED SPARKS.
THE acts of the Revolution derive dignity and interest from the
character of the actors, and the nature and magnitude of the
events. It has been remarked, that in all great political revolutions, men have arisen possessed of extraordinary endowments,
adequate to the exigency of the time. It is true enough, that
such revolutions, or any remarkable and continued exertions of
human power, must be brought to pass by corresponding qufalities in the agents; but whether the occasion makes the men, or
men the occasion, may not always be ascertained with exactness. In either case, however, no period has been adorned with
examples more illustrious, or more perfectly adapted to the
high destiny awaiting them, than that of the American Revolution.
Statesmen were at hand, who, if not skilled in the art of governing empires, were thoroughly imbued with the principles of
just government, intimately acquainted with the history of
former ages, and, above all, with the condition, sentiments, feelings of their countrymen. If there were no Richelieus nor
Mazarines, no Cecils nor Chathams, in America, there were
men, who, like Themistocles, knew how to raise a small state to
glory and greatness.
The eloquence and the internal counsels of the Old Congress
were never recorded; we know them only in their results; but
that assembly, with no other power than that conferred by the
suffrage of the people, with no other influence than that of their
public virtue and talents, and without precedent to guide their
deliberations, unsupported even by the arm of law or of ancient
usages-that assembly levied troops, imposed taxes, and for
years not only retained the confidence and upheld the civil existence of a distracted country, but carried through a perilous
war under its most aggravating burdens of sacrifice and suffering.
Can we imagine a situation, in which were required higher
moral courage, more intelligence and talent, a deeper insight
into human nature and the principles of social and political organizations, or, indeed, any of those qualities which constitute
greatness of character in a statesman? See, likewise, that work
of wonder, the Confederation, a union of independent states,
constructed in the very heart of a desolating war, but with a
beauty and strength, imperfect as it was, of which the ancient
leagues of the Amphictyons, the Achaeans, the Lycians, and the
modern confederacies of Germany, Holland, Switzerland, afford
neither exemplar nor parallel.
311THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
In their foreign affairs these same statesmen showed no less
sagacity and skill, taking their stand boldly in the rank of nations, maintaining it there, competing with the tacti;s of practised diplomacy, and extorting from the powers of the Old
World not only the homage of respect but the proffers of
friendship.
The military events of the Revolution, which necessarily occupy so much of its history, are not less honorable to the actors,
nor less fruitful in the evidences they afford of large design and
ability of character. But these we need not recount. They live
in the memory of all; we have heard them from the lips of
those who saw and suffered; they are inscribed on imperishable
monuments; the very hills and plains around us tell of achievements which can never die; and the day will come, when the
traveller, who has gazed and pondered at Marathon and Waterloo, will linger on the mount where Prescott fought and Warren
fell, and say--Here is the field where man has struggled in his
most daring conflict; here is the field where liberty poured out
her noblest blood, and won her brightest and most enduring
laurels.
Happy was it for America, happy for the world, that a great
name, a guardian genius, presided over her destinies in war,
combining more than the virtues of the Roman Fabius and the
Theban Epaminondas, and compared with whom, the conquerors of the world, the Alexanders and Caesars, are but pageants
crimsoned with blood and decked with the trophies of slaughter,
objects equally of the wonder and the execration of mankind.
The hero of America was the conqueror only of his country's
foes, and the hearts of his countrymen. To the one he was a
terror, and in the other he gained an ascendency, supreme, unrivalled, the tribute of admiring gratitude, the reward of a nation's love.
The American armies, compared with the embattled legions
of the Old World, were small in numbers, but the soul of a
whole people centred in the bosom of these more than Spartan
bands, and vibrated quickly and keenly with every incident that
befell them, whether in their feats of valor, or the acuteness of
their sufferings. The country itself was one wide battle-field, in
which not merely the life-blood, but the dearest interests, the
sustaining hopes, of every individual, were at stake. It was
not a war of pride and ambition between monarchs, in which an
island or a province might be the award of success; it was a
contest for personal liberty and civil rights, coming down in its
principles to the very sanctuary of home and the fireside, and
312MARCHI OF BERNARDO DEL CARPIO.
determining for every man the measure of responsibility he
should hold over his own condition, possessions, and happiness.
The spectacle was grand and new, and may well be cited as the
most glowing page in the annals of progressive man.
The instructive lesson of history, teaching by example, can
no where be studied with more profit, or with a better promise,
than in this revolutionary period of America; and especially by
us, who sit under the tree our fathers have planted, enjoy its
shade, and are nourished by its fruits. But little is our merit,
or gain, that we applaud their deeds, unless we emulate their
virtues. Love of country was in them an absorbing principle,
an undivided feeling; not of a fragment, a section, but of the
whole country. Union was the arch on which they raised the
strong tower of a nation's independence. Let the arm be palsied that would loosen one stone in the basis of this fair structure, or mar its beauty; the tongue mute, that would dishonor
their names, by calculating the value of that which they deemed
without price.
They have left us an example already inscribed in the world's
memory; an example portentous to the aims of tyranny in every land; an example that will console in all ages the drooping
aspirations of oppressed humanity. They have left us a written charter as a legacy, and as a guide to our course. But
every day convinces us that a written charter may become powerless. Ignorance may misinterpret it; ambition may assail and
faction destroy its vital parts; and aspiring knavery may at last
sing its requiem on the tomb of departed liberty. It is the
spirit which lives; in this are our safety and our hope-the
spirit of our fathers; and while this dwells deeply in our
remembrance, and its flame is cherished, ever burning, ever
pure, on the altar of our hearts; while it incites us to think
as they have thought, and do as they have done, the honor and
the praise will be ours, to have preserved unimpaired the rich
inheritance, which they so nobly achieved.

The Progress of         Scientific  Art.-vEBSTER.
MR. PRESIDENT, one of the most striking characteristics of this
age is the extraordinary progress which it has witnessed in popular knowledge.   A new and powerful impulse has been acting
in the social system of late, producing this effect in a most remarkable degree.
In morals, in politics, in art, in literature, there is a vast
accession to the number of readers, and to the number of proficients.  The present state of popular knowledge is not the result
314EXTRACT FROM FAUSTUS.
of a slow and uniform progress, proceeding through a lapse of
years, with the same regular degree of motion.  It is evidently
the result of some new causes, brought into powerful action, and
producing their consequences rapidly and strikingly. What, sir,
are these causes?
This is not an occasion, sir, for discussing such a question at
length; allow me to say, however, that the improved state of
popular knowledge is but the necessary result of the improved
condition of the great mass of the people. Knowledge is not
one of our merely physical wants. Life may be sustained without it. But, in order to live, men must be fed, and clothed, and
sheltered; and in a state of things in which one's whole labor
can do no more than procure clothes, food, and shelter, he can
have no time nor means for mental improvement. Knowledge,
therefore, is not attained, and cannot be attained, till there is
some degree of respite from daily manual toil, and never-ending
drudgery.  But whenever a less degree of labor will produce
the absolute necessaries of life, then there come leisure and
means, both to teach and to learn.
But if this great and wonderful extension of popular knowledge be the result of an improved condition, it may, in the next
place, well be asked, what are the causes which have thus suddenly produced that great improvement? Ilow is it that the
means of food, clothing, and shelter, are now so much more
cheaply and abundantly procured, than formerly?  Sir, t-he main
cause I take to be the progress of scientific art, or a new extent
of the application of science to art. This it is, which has so
much distinguished the last half century in Europe and in America; and its effects are everywhere visible, and especially among
us. Man has found new allies and auxiliaries, in the powers of
nature, and in the inventions of mechanism.

This hour of beauty and benignity;
Look yonder, with delighted heart and eye,
On those low cottages that shine so bright,
(Each with its garden plot of smiling green,)
Robed in the glory of the setting sun!
But he is parting-fading-day is overYonder he hastens to diffuse new life.
Oh, for a wing to raise me up from earth,
Nearer, and yet more near, to the bright orb,
That unrestrained I still might follow him!
Then should I see, in one unvarying glow
Of deathless evening, the reposing world
Beneath me-the hills kindling-the sweet vales,
Beyond the hills, asleep in the soft beams;
The silver streamlet, at the silent touch
Of heavenly light, transfigured into gold,
Flowing in brightness inexpressible!
Nothing to stop or stay my godllike motion!
The rugged hill, with its wild cliffs, in vain
Would rise to hide the sun; in vain would strive
To check my glorious course; the sea already,
With its illumined bays, that burn beneath
The lord of day, before the astonished eyes
Opens its bosom--and he seems at last
Just sinking-no-a power unfelt beforeAn impulse indescribable succeeds!
Onward, entranced, I haste to drink the beams
Of the unfading light-before me dayAnd night left still behind-and overhead
Wide heaven-and under me the spreading sea!
A glorious vision, while the setting sun
is lingering! Oh, to the spirit's flight,
HIow faint and feeble are material wings!
Yet such our nature is, that when the lark,
High over -us, unseen in the blue sky
Thrills his heart-piercing song, we feel ourselves
Press up from earth, as'twere in rivalry;
And when above the savage hill of pines,
The eagle sweeps with outspread wings-and when
The crane pursues, high off, his homeward path,
Flying o'er watery moors and wide lakes lonely!
In my breast,
Alas! two souls have taken their abode,
And each is struggling there for mastery!
One to the world, and the world's sensual pleasures,
Clings closely, with scarce separable organs;
The other struggles to redeem itself,
And rise from the entanglements of earthStill feels its true home is not here-still longs
And strives-and would with violence regain

Where should the Scholar Live?-LONGFELLOw.
WHERE should the scholar live?  In solitlide or in society?
In the green stillness of the country, where he can hear the
heart of nature beat, or in the dark, gray city, where he can
hear and feel the throbbing heart of man? I will make answer
for him, and say, in the dark, gray city. Oh, they do greatly
err, who think, that the stars are all the poetry which cities have;
and therefore, that the poet's only dwelling should be in sylvan
solitudes, under the green roof of trees. Beautiful, no doubt,
are all the forms of nature, when transfigured by the miraculous
power of poetry; hamlets and harvest fields, and nut-brown
waters, flowing ever under the forest, vast and shadowy, with
all the sights and sounds of rural life. But after all, what are
these but the decorations and painted scenery in the great theatre of human life? What are they but the coarse materials of
the poet's song?  Glorious, indeed, is the world of God around
us, but more glorious the world of God within us. There lies
the land of song; there lies the poet's native land. The river
of life, that flows through streets tumultuous, bearing along so
many gallant hearts, so many wrecks of humanity; the many
homes and households, each a little woild in itself, revolving
round its fireside, as a central sun; all forms of human joy and
suffering, brought into that narrow compass; and to be in this
and be a part of this; acting, thinking, rejoicing, sorrowing, with
his fellow-men; such, such should be the poet's life.  If he would
describe the world, he should live in the world. The mind of
the scholar, also, if you would have it large and liberal, should
come in contact with other minds.  It is better that his armor
should be somewhat bruised even by rude encounters, than hang

a voice from heaven; of those sublime efforts of poetical genius
which still freshen, as they pass from age to age, in undying
vigor; of those finished histories which still enlighten and instruct governments in their duty and their destiny; of those
matchless orations which roused nations to arms, and chained
senates to the chariot-wheels of all-conquering eloquence. These
all may now be read in our vernacular tongue. Ay, as one remembers the face of a dead friend by gathering up the broken
fragments of his image-as one listens to the tale of a dream
twice told-as one catches the roar of the ocean in the ripple of a
rivulet-as one sees the blaze of noon in the first glimmer of
twilight....
There is not a single nation from the North to the South of
Europe, from the bleak shores of the Baltic to the bright plains
of immortal Italy, whose literature is not embedded in the very
elements of classical learning. The literature of England is, in
an emphatic sense, the production of her scholars; of men who
have cultivated letters in her universities, and colleges, and
grammar-schools; of men who thought any life too short, chiefly
because it left some relic of antiquity unmastered, and any other
fame humble, because it faded in the presence of Roman and
Grecian genius. He who studies English literature without the
lights of classical learning loses half the charms of its sentiments
and style, of its force and feelings, of its delicate touches, of its
delightful allusions, of its illustrative associations. Who, that
reads the poetry of Gray, does not feel that it is the refinement
of classical taste which gives such inexpressible vividness and
transparency to his diction? Who, that reads the concentrated
sense and melodious versification of Dryden and Pope, does not
perceive in them the disciples of the old school, whose genius
was inflamed by the heroic verse, the terse satire, and the playful wit of antiquity? Who, that meditates over the strains of
lVlilton, does not feel that he drank deep at
" Siloa's brook, that flow'd
Fast by the oracle of God"--
that the fires of his magnificent mind were lighted by coals from
ancient altars?
It is no exaggeration to declare that he who proposes to
abolish classical studies proposes to render, in a great measure,
inert and unedifying the mass of English literature for three centuries; to rob us of the glory of the past, and much of the
instruction of future ages; to blind us to excellencies which few
may hope to equal an! none,o surpass; to annihilate associa39THE PRACTIC kL ELOCUTIONIST.
for ever rusting on the wall. Nor will his themes be few or
trivial, because apparently shut in between the walls of houses,
and having merely the decorations of street scenery. A ruined
character is as picturesque as a ruined castle. There are dark
abysses and yawning gulfs in the human heart, which can be
rendered passable only by bridging them over with iron nerves
and sinews, as Challey bridged the Savine in Switzerland, and
Telford the sea between Anglesea and England, with chain
bridges. These are the great themes of human thought; not
green grass, and flowers, and moonshine. Besides, the mere external forms of nature we make our own and carry with us into
the city, by the power of memory.
A Legend of the Rhine.-VICTOR HUGO.
IN my childhood there was an old wood-cut suspended near
my bed, hung up there by an old German nurse, which represented an ancient, mouldering, isolated ruin, amidst fogs and
mountains. The sky was charged with black and threatening
clouds, and every evening, after offering up my prayers, and
previous to closing my eyes, I used to gaze till the last moment
upon the wood-cut. In the night I saw it in my dreams, and
connected it with terrible ideas. The tower seemed immense.
Water poured, and lightning fell from the clouds, while the
wind from the mountains seemed to groan heavily. One day I
inquired of the nurse the name of the tower; to which she answered, making the sign of the cross, "The Mailsethurm "
Then she related to me, how, in older times at Mayence, there
was once a wicked archbishop named Hatto, also abbot of
Fulda; "a covetous priest," said she, " opening the hand to
bestow benedictions rather than benefactions." In a year of
scarcity he bought up all the corn, in order to sell it dear to
the people.  Then came famine, and the peasants along the
Rhine were all dying of hunger, so that they crowded round
the burgh of Mayence, crying aloud for bread, which the archbishop haughtily denied. The story now becomes dreadful.
The starving people, refusing to disperse, thronged the archbishop's palace; when, lo! the enraged Hatto surrounded them
with his archer guard, who, seizing the men, women, and chil318A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.
dren, shut them up in a barn, and set fire to it; a scene, said
the old lady, " that would have melted rocks of stone." Hatto,
however, only laughed, and on hearing the wretched beings
scream in the flames, remarked, "'Tis but the'squeaking of
rats!"  The barn was now in ashes, and Mayence unpeopled
and deserted; when suddenly a multitude of rats swarmed
forth from the barn, like worms from the sores of Ahasuerus;
making their way through the fissures of the walls, defying the
foot that spurned them, multiplying at every moment, inundating the streets, citadel, and palace, cellars and chambers; in
fact, a divine plague and visitation! Hatto fled from Mayence,
pursued by the rats into the field, and took refuge in Bingen,
which was surrounded by lofty walls. It was there the archbishop had built a tower in the middle of the Rhine, to which
he proceeded in a boat, round which his archers beat the water.
But, lo! the rats also took to the river, crossed the Rhine,
clambered up the towers, gnawed the doors, windows, roofs,
ceilings, and floors, and finding their way to the lower ditch, in
which the cruel bishop was hid, devoured him alive!
The malediction of heaven and indignation of man have laid
the finger of scorn upon that fatal tower, now called the Maiisethurm.  It stands deserted and decaying in the middle of the
river, and a reddish vapor is sometimes seen at night issuing from
the walls, like the smoke of a furnace; according to the superstition of the spot, the soul of Hatto returning to haunt its scene
of condemnation.
Did you ever remark, that history is often immoral, while
tales and fictions are moral, virtuous, and decent? In history,
the law of the strongest is always good; tyrants are victorious,
and headsmen prosper; the monstrous fatten; the Syllas become
honest burghers, and Louis XI. and Cromwell die quietly in
their bed. Fictions always command a view of the infernal regions; no delinquency but what has its chastisement; no crime
but it ensures its penalty; no sinner but eventually becomes
penitent, or meets with his fitting doom. This arises from history moving in infinite space, and fiction being restricted to the
finite. The author of a fiction does not assume the right of laying down the facts without exposing the consequences; for he
works in the dark; is sure of nothing' must teach, advise,
expound; and would not dare invent incidents without an immediate conclusion. GoD, who creates history, divulges only
what seemeth to Him good! The consequences of historical
events often lie at too wide a distance from their origin to be
readily retraceable.
319THE PRACTICAL ELOC -TIONIST.
Maiusethurm is an appropriate name. One finds there all that
it promises. But there are minds which consider themselves
matter of fact, and are simply barren; which would fain extinguish all the poetry of life, and say to the imagination as the
gardener did to the nightingale, "Will you never be quiet, stupid beast?"
Such people as these pretend that the name of Mausethurm
comes from MJiuse or Mauth, signifying toll; and pretend that,
in the tenth century, before the river was widened, the Rhine
was only navigable on the left side, and that the town of Bingen
exacted, by means of this tower, a toll from all the craft upon
the river. They back this assertion by the fact of there being
two such towers close to Strasbourg, devoted to such a purpose;
and, in like manner, called "Mdusethurme."  For such grave
reasoners, utterly inaccessible to legendary lore, the town must
remain a toll-bar, and Hatto a custom-house officer!
For all well-thinking old women, myself among the rest,
Miusethurm derives its name from miduse, which is derived from
nmus, which means a rat; and for us, the pretended toll and
custom-house officer are mere vulgar fictions.
After all, the two' opinions may be reconciled; for about the
sixteenth or seventeenth century, after Luther and Erasmus, the
municipal authorities may have utilized the tower of Hatto, and
installed some tollage in the haunted tower. Why not? Rome
established her custom-house in the temple of Antoninus; and
the outrage she offered to history Bingen may have offered to
tradition! By this rule, JMauth would be right, and Mifuse
wrong. However it may be, ever since my old nurse related to
me the story of Hatto, it has remained one of the familiar visions of my mind. Every man has his favorite phantoms, just
as all have their hobbies. Night is the realm of dreams. Sometimes a gleam, at others a flame, brightens our souls. The
self-same dream imay bring " airs from heaven," and " blasts from
hell!" Imagination throws up her Bengal lights, coloring all
things with their fantastic hue.
I must observe that the Mause tower always appeared to me
a tale of especial horror; and that when my fancy urged me
towards the Rhine, my first thought was neither the Cathedral
of Cologne, the dome of Mayence, nor the Pfalz, but the Mause
tower! Imagine therefore the feelings of a poor credulous poet,
as well as impassioned antiquary, when, twilight having succeeded the parting day, the hills became less defined, the trees
black, with a few stars twinkling thereon, the Rhine murmuring
unseen, and the road fore-shortened as night approached, losing
320A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.
itself, as it were, in mist a few steps before me. I walked slowly
on, tny eyes peering into the obscurity. I kne-r I was approaching the Miusethurm, that mysterious ruin till now an hallucination, which was about to become a reality.
A Chinese proverb says: "Strain the bow, and the arrow
swerves!"  Such is the case with the mind. By degrees the
vapor called reverie mounted into my brain. The rustle of the
foliage was hushed. The faint ring of the distant forge clinked
in my ear from afar off; and, lost in the vague current of my
ideas, I forgot both rats and niice, the toll and the archbishop,
and listened, as I walked along, to the remote clang of the anvil, which, among the varying voices of evening, of all others
wakes in my mind the wildest range of ideas.
On suddenly turning, I halted, when lo! at my feet lay the
Rhine, crushing through the bushes, hoarse and impetuous; to
the right and lefl were mountains, or rather dense masses of
darkness, their summits vanishing in the clouds, which here and
there were transpierced by them-the horizon forming a vast
curtain of shade.
In the middle of the river, in the distance, rose from the still
and dead waters a high black tower of hideous form; from the
summit of which proceeded, by fits and starts, a reddened nebulosity. This gleam, resembling the reverberation of some redhot pipe or furnace, threw out its glare upon the hills, settirlg
forth on the right bank an isolated ruin-the lengthening shadow
of which was reflected in the water, even to my feet. Imagine,
if possible, this sinister landscape, defined by such singular
effects of light and shade. Not a voice or cry of bird intruded
upon the chill and mournful silence, save the monotonous ripple
of the Rhine.
The Mliusethurm was before me! I had conceived it to be
more imposing. All was there that I could require-the solemn
night, the trembling reeds, the roar of the Rhine, as though hydras were hissing under its waters; the fitful moaning of the
wind, the red glare from the tower, the soul of Hatto! And
yet I was disappointed! No matter! I clung to the work of
my fancy; and a work of fancy it was fated to remain.
I felt inclined, in spite of the lateness of the hour, and without waiting for daylight, to visit the edifice.  The apparition
was before my eyes, the night dark, the pale phantom of the
archbishop visible in the water. Surely this was the very moment to visit this formidable tower.
But how was I to proceed? where to find a boat? At such
an hour. and in such a place, to swim across the Rhine was too
14*
321THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
great an effort for the sake of a spectre. Besides, had I been a
first-rate swimmer, and rash enough for the attempt, within a
few yards of the spot is the well-known whirlpool of Bingerloch, which formerly swallowed up vessels with as much ease
as a shark a herring, and to which the best of swimmers
would prove a mere gudgeon. I was consequently somewhat
perplexed!
On my road towards the ruin, I recalled to mind that the
vibrations of the silver bell, and the ghosts of the donjon of Velmich, do not prevent excellent vines from flourishing near the
walls, and that it was to be presumed the river, even here, must
contain fish. I might therlefore probably find the hut of some
salmon-fisher at hand. As the vine-dressers defy Falkenstein
and its Miause, the fishermen may well confront the Hatto and
his rats!
I was not mistaken. Nevertheless I proceeded some distance
without success, reached the nearest point to the ruin, and, on
passing it, found myself at the confluence of the Nahe. Already
I had begun to despair of my purpose, when, on approaching
the willows on the bank, I perceived one of those spider-like
nets I have already mentioned. A few paces off a boat was
moored, in which lay a man enveloped in a blanket. I woke
him up, and pointed to the tower, but he did not understand
me. I then showed him a Saxon dollar, a sign which he understood in a moment; and some minutes afterwards we were
gliding along like two spectres, in the direction of the Mitusethurm.
As we approached the tower from the middle of the river, it
appeared to diminish in consequence of the breadth of the
Rhine. This effect was of short duration. As I got into the
boat above the tower, the current soon carried us thither; my
eyes being fixed on the red glare still issuing from the summit
of the tower, which I now saw increase in size at every stroke
of the oar, so as to become really imposing.
On a sudden I felt the boat bend beneath me, and the shock
jerked my cane from out of my hands. I looked towards my
companion; who, steering coolly on by the sinister guidance of
the glowing MAusethurm, said aloud, " Bingerloch i" We were
passing the whirlpool!
The boat swerved, the man rose, and seizing a pole with one
hand, and a rope with the other, plunged the first into the
water, and leaning on it with all his weight, ran along the
plank on the side; I felt the boat grate harshly against the
rocks beneath!
322A LEGEI-D OF THE RHINE.
This difficult manceuvre was executed with marvellous dexterity, and withi)ut uttering a word. Suddenly withdrawing his
pole firom the water, he held it up horizontally, and threw out
at rope into the water. The boat immediately stopped. We
were arrived.
There stood the lonely and formidable Mausethurm, with its
base deeply furrowed, as if the rats of the legend had gnawed
through the very stones.
The glare had now become a fierce and bFlliant flame, throwing forth its rays far and wide, and bursting from the crevices
and fissures of the tower, as if through the holes of a gigantic
magic-lantern. I seemed to hear within a harsh and continuous
noise as if from grinding. I now landed, and bade the boatman
wait for me, and approached the ruin.
I had at last then attained the object of my wishes.  This
was the rat-swarming tower of Hatto, close to me, before my
very eyes. I was literally on the threshold, able to touch, feel,
pluck the grass from the very stones of the nightmare of my
youth! Yes, an embodied nightmare, real and genuine, was
before me! What extraordinary sensations must arise from so
strange a contact!
The front before which I was standing had a glazed loophole, and four windows of unequal sizes; two on the second,
and two on the third story. At about the height of a man's
head, under the lower windows, was a low wide door, open,
and communicating with the ground by means of a heavy ladder with only three steps. From this door issued more light
than from the windows. As I proceeded towards it with caution, over the sharp and pointed rocks, something round and
black passed rapidly by me, almost between my feet, and I
could have fancied it to be an enormous rat flying towards the
reeds. I still heard the hoarse grinding within, and, in a few
more strides, found myself before the door.
This door, which the architect of the wicked bishop had constructed high above the soil, to render the access more difficult
to the rats, had formed the entrance to the lower rc m of the
tower, when it had upper and lower rooms. But now bothi
floors and ceilings have fallen in, and the tower of Mausethurm
has four high walls, rubbish for floor, and the sky for roof. I
looked however into the space from  which I had heard the
grinding, and seen so strange a light; and there observed two
men in an angle, their backs turned towards me; the one
bending, the other leaning upon a kind of rod, which by a slight
exercise of the imagination might have been converted into an
323THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
instrument of torture. Their arms and feet were naked, covered with rags, with a leather apron to the knees, and a hooded
jacket on their back. One was old and gray, the other young,
with light hair, reddened by the reflection from a vast furnace
in the opposite angle of the building. The hood of the old man
inclined to the right, like a Guelph; that of the young man to
the left, like a Ghibeline. But they were neither the one nor
the other, nor even devils, but simply two smiths.
Their furnace, inwvhich was a red-hot bar of iron, filled the  
building with the glare and reddened smoke, constituting the
soul of Hatto transformed by the powers of hell into fiery vapor.
The grinding proceeded from a file. Near the door was an anvil with two huge hammers, the sound of which an hour before
had prompted my poetical effusion.
And thus the Mausethurm has progressed into a forge! Why
then might it not as well have been a custom-house? Decidedly, my dear friend, f~auth was the true version!
Nothing can be more dilapidated than the tower, both within
and without. The walls, from which once were suspended
episcopal hangings, and afterwards, according to the legend,
gnawed by the rats with the name of Hatto, are now naked,
worn by the rain, covered by the moisture without with a green
coating, and by the furnace within with a black.
The two smiths proved to be worthy people. Having ascended the ladder, they showed me into the building; and near a
chimney pointed out a narrow door leading into a turret without windows, and almost inaccessible, in which the archbishop
is said to have sought refuge. They also lent me a lantern to
visit every part of the diminutive island; which is a long and
narrow tongue of land, with a belt of reeds and rushes, and the
Euphorbia o ficinalis.  At every step in this island, the feet
knock against hillocks, or sink into galleries; for moles have
succeeded to the rats.
The Rhine has left uncovered the eastern point of the island,
which seems to stem like a prow the current. On lowering
with my lantern, I found the tower to be built on red marble,
which has the appearance of being veined with blood.'The
Mause tower is square.  The turret, of which the smiths
showed me the interior, presents a picturesque feature, looking
towards Bingen. The pentagonal form of this lofty turret is
evidently of the eleventh century, and the rats seem to have
particularly wreaked their vengeance upon its base. The apertures in the tower have so completely lost their form, that it
would be impossible to infer a date. The stone-facings are so
324THE LAST EVENING BEFORE ETERNITY.
time-worn as to resemble hideous leprosy.   The stones which
once constituted battlements might pass for the teeth of the
walrus or mastodon cemented into the walls.
After gathering a sprig of Euphorbia, I quitted the Mausethurm.   The boatman was fast asleep.    As we rowed away
from the island, and the two smiths returned to the anvil, I
heard the heated iron hiss aloud, as it was plunged into the
water. Half an hour afterwards I reached Bingen, and after
supper, though I was much fatigued, and all the people were
in bed, by means of a dollar I managed to ascend to a dilapidated old castle, called the Klopp.   I was rewarded with a
scene worthy of closing such a day, having seen so much, and
indulged in so many fancies.  It was dead of night.  Beneatl
me lay a mass of black houses, like a vast lake of darkness,
there being but seven lights visible in the town.  By a strange
chance, these seven lights, like seven stars, exactly represented

Unwritten Music.-N. P. WILLIS.
MEPHISTOPHELES could hardly have founld a more striking
amusement for Faust than the passage of three hundred miles
in the canal from Lake Erie to the Hudson. As I walked up
and down the deck of the packet-boat, I thought to myself, that
if it were not for thoughts of things that come more home to
one's "business and bosom," (particularly "bosom,") I could
be content to retake my berth at Schenectady, and return to
Buffalo for amusement. The Erie canal-boat is a long and very
pretty drawing-room afloat. It has a library, sofas, a tolerable
cook, curtains or Venetian blinds, a civil captain, and no smell
of steam or perceptible motion. It is drawn generally by three
horses at a fair trot, and gets you through about a hundred
miles a day, as softly as if you were witched over the ground
by Puck and Mustard-seed. The company (say fifty people) is
such as pleases Heaven; thougl I must say (with my eye all
along the shore, collecting the va.ious dear friends I have made
and left on that long canal) there are few highways on which
you will meet so many lovely and loving fellow-passengers. On
this occasion my star was bankrupt--Job Smith being my only
civilized companion-and I was left to the unsatisfactory society
of my own thoughts and the scer ery.
326UNWAIr~EN MUSIC.
Discontented as I may seem to have been, I remember,
through eight or ten years of stirring and thickly-sown manhood,
every moment of that lonely evening. I remember the progression of the sunset, from the lengthening shadows and the
first gold upon the clouds, to the deepening twilight of the newsprung star hung over the wilderness. I remember what I am
going to describe-a twilight anthem in the forest-as you remember an air of Rossini's, or a transition in the half-fiendish,
half-heavenly creations of Meyerbeer. I thought time dragged
heavenly then, but I wish I had as light a heart and could feel
as vix idly now!
The Erie Canal is cut a hundred or two miles through the
heart of the primeval wilderness of America, and the boat was
gliding on silently and swiftly, and never sailed a lost cloud
through the abyss of space on a course more apparently new
and untrodden. The luxuriant soil had sent up a rank grass
that covered the horse-path like velvet; the Erie water was clear
as a brook in the winding canal; the old shafts of the gigantic
forest spurred into the sky by thousands, and the yet unscared
eagle swung off from the dead branch of the pine, and skimmed
the tree-tops for another perch, as if he had grown to believe
that gliding spectre a harmless phenomenon of nature. The
horses drew steadily and unheard at the end of the long line;
the steersman stood motionless at the tiller, and I lay on a heap
of baggage in the prow, attentive to the slightest breathing of
nature.
The gold of the sunset had glided up the dark pine-tops and
disappeared, like a ring taken slowly from an Ethiop's finger;
the whip-poor-will had chanted the first stave of his lament;
the bat was abroad, and the screech-owl, like all bad singers,
commenced without waiting to be importuned, though we were
listening for the nightingale. The air, as I said before, had been
all day breathless; but as the first chill of evening displaced the
warm atmosphere of the departed sun, a slight breeze crisped
the mirrored bosom of the canal, and then commenced the night
anthem of the forest, audible, I would fain believe, in its soothing changes, by the dead tribes whose bones whiten amid the
perishing leaves. First, whisperingly yet articulately, the suspended and wavering foliage of the birch was touched by the
many-fingered wind, and, like a faint prelude, the silver-lined
leaves rustled in the low branches; and, with a moment's pause,
when you could hear the moving of the vulture's claws upon the
bark, as he turned to get his breast to the wind, the incleasing
breeze swept into the pine-tops, and drew forth from their fringe327THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.

Ancient and Modern Eloquence.-JoiN Q ADAMS,
WITH the dissolution of Roman liberty, and the decline of
Roman taste, the reputation and the excellency of the oratorical
art fell alike into decay. Under the despotism of the Caesars,
the end of eloquence was perverted from persuasion to panegyric, and all her faculties were soon palsied by the touch of
corruption, or enervated by the impotence of servitude. Then
succeeded the midnight of the monkish ages, when with the
other liberal arts she slumbered in the profound darkness of tlle
cloister.
At the revival of letters in modern Europe, eloquence, together with her sister muses, awoke, and shook the poppies
from her brow. But their torpors still tingled in her veins.
In the interval her voice was gone; her favorite languages were
extinct; her organs were no longer attuned to harmony, and her
hearers could no longer understand her speech. The discordant jargon of feudal anarchy had banished the musical dialects,
in which she had always delighted. The theatres of her former
triumphs were either deserted, or they were filled with the babblers of sophistry and chicane. She shrunk intuitively from the
forum, for the last object she remembered to have seen there
was the head of her darling Cicero, planted upon the rostrum.
She ascended the tribunals of justice; there she found her child,
Persuasion, manacled and pinioned by the letter of the law;
there she beheld an image of herself, stammering in barbarous
Latin, and staggering under the lumber of a thousand volumes.
Her heart fainted within her. She lost all confidence in herself. Together with her irresistible powers, she lost proportionably the. consideration of the world, until, instead of comprising the whole system of public education, she found herself
excluded from the circle of science, and declared an outlaw
from the realms of learning. She was not however doomed
to eternal silence. With the progress of freedom and of liberal science, in various parts of modern Europe, she obtained
access to mingle in the deliberations of their parliaments.

of the magnolia, and the rich cups of the tulip-trees, stirred and
answered with their different voices like many-toned harps; and
when the wind was fully abroad, and every moving thing on the
breast of the earth was roused from its daylight repose, the irregular and capricious blast, like a player on an organ of a
thousand stops, lulled and strengthened by turns, and from the
hiss in the rank grass, low as the whisper of fairies, to the tlunder of the impinging and groaning branches of the larch and the
fir, the anthem went ceaselessly through its changes, and the
harmony (though the owl. broke in with his scream, and though
the overblown monarch of the wood came crashing to the earth)
was still perfect and without a jar. It is strange that there is
no sound of nature out of tune. The roar of the waterfall comes
into this anthem of the forest like an accompaniment of bassoons,
and the occasional bark of the wolf, or the scream of a nightbird, or even the deep-throated croak of the frog, is no more
discordant than the outburst of an octave flute above the even
melody of an orchestra; and it is surprising how the large raindrops, pattering on the leaves, and the small voice of the
nightingale (singing, like nothing but himself, sweetest in the
darkness) seems an intensitive and a low burden to the general
anthem of the earth-as it were, a single voice among instruments.
I had what Wordsworth calls a "couchant ear" in my youth,
and my story will wait, dear reader, while- I tell you of another
harmony that I learned to love in the wilderness.
There will come sometimes in the spring--say in May, or
whenever the snow-drops and sulphur butterflies are tempted
out by the first timorous sunshine-there will come, I say, in
that yearning and youth-renewing season, a warm shower at
noon. - Our tent shall be pitched on the skirts of a forest of
young pines, and the evergreen foliage, if foliage it may be called,
shall be a daily refreshment to our eye while watching, with the
west wind upon our cheeks, the unclothed branches of the elm.
The rain descends softly and warm; but with the sunset the
clouds break away, and it grows suddenly cold enough to freeze.
The next morning you shall come out with me to a hillside looking upon the south, and lie down with your ear to the earth.
The pine tassels hold in every four of their fine fingers a drop
328THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE.
of rain frozen like a pearl in a long ear-ring, sustained in their
loose grasp by the rigidity of the cold. The sun grows warm
at ten, and the slight green fingers begin to relax and yield, and
by eleven they are all drooping their icy pearls upon the dead
leaves with a murmur through the forest like the swarming of
the bees of Hybla. There is not much variety in its music, but
it is a pleasant monotone for thought, and if you have a restless
fever in your bosom, (as I had, when I learned to love it, for
the travel which has corrupted the heart and the ear that it
soothed, and satisfied then,) you may lie down with a crooked
root under your head in the skirts of the forest, and thank
Heaven for an anodyne to care. And it is better than the voice
of. your friend, or the song of your lady-love, for it exacts no
gratitude, and will not desert you ere the echo dies upon the
wind.
Oh, how many of these harmonies there are--how many that
we hear, and how many that are "too constant to be heard!"
I could go back to my youth, now, with this thread of recollection, and unsepulture a hoard of simple and long-buried joys
that would bring the blush upon my cheek to think how my
senses are dulled since such things could give me pleasure! Is
there no " well of Kanathos" for renewing the youth of the soul?
no St. Hilary's cradle? no elixir to cast the slough of heartsickening and heart-tarnishing custom? Find me an alchemy
for that, with your alembic and crucible, and you may resolve
to dross again your philosopher's stone!
The Brothers Cheer:yble.-DIcoENs.
THE Square in which the counting-house of the brothers
Cheeryble was situated, although it might not wholly realize the
very sanguine expectations which a stranger would be disposed
to form on hearing the fervent encomiums bestowed upon it by
Tim Linkinwater, was, nevertheless, a sufficiently desirable nook
in the heart of a busy town like London, and one which occupied a high place in the affectionate remembrances of several
grave persons. domiciled in the neighborhood, whose recollections, however, dated from a much more recent period, and
329THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
whose attachment to the spot was far less absorbing than were
the recollections and attachment of the enthusiastic Tim.
And let not those whose eyes have been accustomed to the
aristocratic gravity of Grosvenor Square and Hanover Square,
the dowager barrenness and frigidity of Fitzroy Square, or the
gravel walks and garden seats of the Squares of Russell and
Euston, suppose that the affections of Tim Linkinwater, or the
inferior lovers of this particular locality, had been awakened and
kept alive by any refreshing associations with leaves however
dingy, or grass, however bare and thin. The City Square has
no inclosure, save the lamp-post in the middle, and no grass but
the weeds which spring up round its base. It is a quiet, littlefrequented, retired spot, favorable to melancholy and contemplation, and appointments of long-waiting; and up and down its
every side the Appointed saunters idly by the hour together,
wakening the echoes with the monotonous sound of his footsteps
on the smooth-worn stones, and counting first the windows and
then the very bricks of the tall silent houses that hem him round
about. In winter-time the snow will linger there, long after it
has melted from the busy streets and highways. "The summer's
sun holds it in some respect, and while he darts his cheerful
rays sparingly into the square, he keeps his fiery heat and glare
for noisier and less-imposing precincts. It is so quiet that you
can almost hear the ticking of your own watch when you stop
to cool in its refreshing atmosphere. There is a distant humof coaches, not of insects-but no other sound disturbs the stillness of the square. The ticket-porter leans idly against the post
at the corner, comfortably warm, but not hot, although the day
is broiling. His white apron flaps languidly in the air, his head
gradually droops upon his breast, he takes very long winks with
both eyes at once; even he is unable to withstand the soporific
influence of the place, and is gradually falling asleep. But now
he starts into full wakefulness, recoils a step or two, and gazes
out before him with eager wildness in his eye. Is it a job, or a
boy at marbles? Does he see a ghost, or hear an organ? No;
sight more unwonted still--there is a butterfly in the square-a
real, live butterfly! astray from flowers and sweets, and fluttering among the iron heads of the dusty area railings!
But if there were not many matters immediately without the
doors of Cheeryble Brothers, to engage the attention or distract
the thoughts of the young clerk, there were not a few within
to interest and amuse him. There was scarcely an object in the
place, animate or inanimate, which did not partake in some degree of the scrupulous method and punctuality of Mr. Timothy
330THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE.
Linkinwater. Punctual as the counting-house dial, which he
maintained to be the best time-keeper in London next after
the clock of some old, hidden, unknown church hard by, (for
Tim held the fabled goodness of that at the Horse Guards to be
a pleasant fiction, invented by jealous West-enders,) the oldc
clerk performed the minutest actions of the day, and arranged
the minutest articles in the little room, in a precise and regular
order, which could not have been exceeded if it had actually
been a real glass case fitted with the choicest curiosities. Paper,
pens, ink, ruler, sealing-wax, wafers, pounce-box, string-box,
fire-box, Tim's hat, Tim's scrupulously-folded gloves, Tim's
other coat-looking precisely like a back view of himself, as it
hung against the wall-all had their accustomed inches of space.
Except the clock, there was not such an accurate and unimpeachable instrument in existence as the little thermometer
which hung behind the door. There was not a bird of such
methodical and business-like habits in all the world as the blindc
blackbird, who dreamed and dozed away his days in a large
snug cage, and had lost his voice from old age years before Tim
first bought him. There was not such an eventful story in the
whole range of anecdote as Tim could tell concerning the acquisition of that very bird: how, compassionating his starved and
suffering condition, he had purchased him, with the view of humanely terminating his wretched life; how he determined to
wait three days and see whether the bird revived; how, before
half the time was out, the bird did revive; and how he went on
reviving and picking up his appetite and good looks until he
gradually became what-" what you see him now, sir"-Tim
would say, glancing proudly at the cage. And with that, Tim
would utter a melodious chirrup, and cry "Dick;" and Dick,
who, for any sign of life he had previously given, might have
been a wooden or stuffed representation of a blackbird indifferently executed, would come to the side of the cage in three
small jumps, and thrusting his bill between the bars, turn his
sightless head towards his old master-and at that moment it
would be very difficult to determine which of the two was the
happier, the bird, or Tim Linkinwater.
Nor was this all. Everything gave back, besides, some reflection of the kindly spirit of the brothers. The warehousemen
and porters were such sturdy jolly fellows that it was a treat to
see them. Among the shipping-announcements and steampacket lists which decorated the'counting-house wall, were designs for alms-houses, statements of charities, and plans for new
hospitals. A  blunderbuss and two swords hung above the

chimney-piece for the terror of evil-doers, but the blunderbuss
was rusty and shattered, and the swords were broken and edgeless. Elsewhere, their open display in such a condition would
have raised a smile, but there it seemed as though even violent.
and offensive weapons partook of the reigning influence, and became emblems of mercy and forbearance.
Such thoughts as these occurred to Nicholas very strongly
on the morning when he first took possession of the vacant
stool, and looked about him more freely and at ease than he had
before enjoyed an opportunity of doing. Perhaps they encouraged and stimulated him to exertion, for during the next two
weeks all his spare hours, late at night and early in the morning, were incessantly devoted to acquiring the mysteries of bookkeeping and some other forms of mercantile account. To these
he applied himself with such steadiness and perseverance that,
although he brought no greater amount of previous knowledge to
the subject than certain dim recollections of two or three very
long sums entered into a ciphering-book at school, and relieved
for parental inspection by the effigy of a fat swan tastefully flourished by the writing-master's own hand, he found himself, at
the end of a fortnight,'in a condition to report his proficiency to
Mr. Linkinwater, and to claim his promise that he, Nicholas
Nickleby, should now be allowed to assist him in his graver
labors.
It was a sight to behold'Tim Linkinwater slowly bringing out
a massive ledger and day-book, and, after turning them over and
over, and affectionately dusting their backls and sides, open the
leaves here and there, and cast his eyes half-mournfully, halfproudly, upon the fair and unblotted entries.
" Four-and-forty year, next May!" said Tim. "Many new
ledgers since then. Four-and-forty year!"
Tim closed the book again.
"Come, come," said Nicholas, "I am   all impatience to
begin."
Tim Linkinwater shook his head with an air of mild reproof.
Mr. Nickleby was not sufficiently impressed with the deep and
awful nature of his undertaking. Sauppose there should be any
mistake-any scratching outYoung men are adventurous. It is extraordinary what they
will rush upon sometimes. Without even taking the precaution
of sitting himself down upon his stool, but standing leisurely at
the desk, and with a smile tipon his face--actually a smile;
(there was no mistake about it; Mr. Linkinwater often mentioned it afterwards;) Nicholas dipped his pen into the ink332THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE.
stand before him, and plunged into the books of Cheeryble
Brothers!
Tim Linkinwater turned pale, and tilting up his stool on the
two legs nearest Nicholas, looked over his shoulder in breathless
anxiety. Brother Charles and brother Ned entered the counting-house together; but Tim Linkinwater, without looking
round, impatientlv waved his hand as a caution that profound
silence must be observed, and followed the nib of the inexperienced pen with strained and eager eyes.
The brothers looked on with smiling faces, but Tim Linkinwater smiled not, nor moved for some minutes. At length he
drew a long, slow breath, and still maintaining his position on
the tilted stool, glanced at brother Charles, secretly pointed
with the feather of his pen towards Nicholas, and nodded
his head in a grave and resolute manner, plainly signifying
"He'll do."
Brother Charles nodded again, and exchanged a laughing
look with brother Ned; but just then Nicholas stopped to refer
to some other page, and Tim Linkinwater, unable to contain his
satisfaction any longer, descended from his stool and caught
him rapturously by the hand.
" He has done it," said Tim, looking round at his employers
and shaking his head triumphantly. " His capital B's and D's
are exactly like mine; he dots all his small i's and crosses every t
as he writes it. There an't such a young man as this in all
London," said Tim, clapping Nicholas on the back, "not one.
Don't tell me. The city can't produce his equal. I challenge
the city to do it!
With this casting down of his gauntlet, Tim Linkinwater
struck the desk such a blow with his clenched fist, that the old
blackbird tumbled off his perch with the start it gave him, and
actually'uttered a feeble croak in the extremity of his astonishment.
" Well said, Tim-well said, Tim Linkinwater!" cried Brother Charles, scarcely less pleased than Tim himself, and clapping his hands gently as he spoke. " I knew our young friend
would take great pains, and I was quite certain he would succeed, in no time. Didn't I say so, brother Ned?"
"You did, my dear brother-certainly, my dear brother, you
said so, and you were quite right," replied Ned. " Quite right,
Tim Linkinwater is excited, but he is justly excited, properly
excited. Tim is a fine fellow. Tim Linkinwater, sir-you're
a fine fellow."
"Here's a pleasant thing to think of," said Tim, wholly re333THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
gardless of this address to himself, and raising his spectacles
from the ledger to the brothers. " Here's a pleasant thing.
Do you suppose I haveni't often thought what would become of
these books when I was gone? Do you suppose I haven't often
thought that things might go on irregular and untidy, here,
after I was taken away? But now," said Tim, extending his
forefinger towards Nicholas, "now, when I've shown him a little more, I'm satisfied. The business will go on when I'm dead
as well as it did when I was alive-just the same; and I shall
have the satisfaction of knowing that there never were such
booksm-never were such books! No, nor never will be such
books-as. the books of Cheeryble Brothers."
Having thus expressed his sentiments, Mr. Linkinwater gave
vent to a short laugh, indicative of defiance to the cities of London and Westminster, and turning again to his desk quietly carried seventy-six from the last column he had added up, and
went on with his work.
"Tim Linkinwater, sir," said brother Charles; "give me
your hand, sir. This is your birthday. How dare you talk
about anything else till you have been wished many happy returns of the day, Tim Linkinwater! God bless you, Tim! God
bless you!
" My dear brother," said the other, seizing Tim's disengaged
fist, " Tim Linkinwater looks ten years younger than he did on
his last birthday."
"Brother Ned, my dear boy," returned the old fellow, "I
believe Tim Linkinwater was born a hundred-and-fifty years
old, and is gradually coming down to five-and-twenty; for he's
younger every birthday than he was the year before."
"So he is, brother Charles, so he is," replied brother Ned.
"There's not a doubt about it."
"Remember, Tim," said brother Charles, "that we dine at
half-past five to-day instead of two o'clockl; we always depart
from our usual custom on this anniversary, as you very well
know, Tim Linkinwater. Mr. Nickleby, my dear sir, you will
make one. Tim   Linkinwater, give me your snuff-box as a
remembrance to brother Charles and myself of an attached and
faithful rascal, and take that in exchange as a feeble mark of
our respect and esteem; and don't open it until you go to bed,
and never say another word upon the subject, or I'll kill the
blackbird. A dog! He should have had a golden cage half-adozen years ago, if it would have made him or his master a bit
the happier. Now, brother Ned, my dear fellow, I'm ready.
At half-past five, remember, Mr Nickleby. Tim Linkinwater,
334THE BROTHERS, IEERYBLE.
sir, take care of Mr. Nickleby at half-past five. Now, brother
Ned."
Chattering away thus, according to custom, to prevent the
possibility of any thanks or acknowledgment being expressed on
the other side, the twins trotted off arm in arm, having endowed
Tim Linkinwater with a costly gold snuff-box, inclosing a banknote worth more than its value ten times told.
At a quarter past five o'clock, punctual to the minute, arrived,
according to annual usage, Tim Linkinwater's sister; and a
great to-do there was between Tim Linkinwater's sister and the
old housekeeper respecting Tim Linkinwater's sister's cap, whiclh
had been dispatched, per boy, from the house of the family
where Tim Linkinwater's sister boarded, and had not yet come
to hand, notwithstanding that it had been packed up in a bandbox, and the bandbox in a handkerchief, and the handkerchief
tied on to the boy's arm; and notwithstanding, too, that the
place of its consignment had been duly set forth at full length
on the back of an old letter, and the boy enjoined, under pain
of divers horrible penalties, the full extent of which the eye of
man could not foresee, to deliver the same with all possible
speed, and not to loiter by the way. Tim Linkinwater's sister
lamented; the housekeeper condoled, and both kept thrusting
their heads out of the second floor window to see if the boy was
"coming"--which would have been highly satisfactory, and,
upon the whole, tantamount to his being come, as the distance
to the corner was not quite five yards-when all of a sudden,
and when he was least expected, the messenger, carrying the
bandbox with elaborate caution, appeared in an exactly opposite
direction, puffing and panting for breath, and flushed with recent
exercise, as well he might be; for he had taken the air, in the
first instance, behind a hackney-coach that went to Camberwell,
and had followed two Punches afterwards, and had seen the
Stilts home to their own door. The cap was all safe, however---
that was one comfort-and it was no use scolding him-that
was another; so the boy went upon his way rejoicing, and Tim
Linkinwater's sister presented herself to the company below
stairs just five minutes after the half-hour had struck by Tim
Linkinwater's own infallible clock.
The company consisted of the brothers Cheeryble, Tim Linkinwater, a ruddy-faced white-headed friend of Tim's, (who was
a superannuated bank clerk,) and Nicholas, who was presented
to Tim Linkinwater's sister with much gravity and solemnity.
The party being now complete, brother Ned rang for dinner,
and, dinrer being shortly afterwards announced, led Tim Link335THE PRACTICAL ELOCU VIONIST.
inwater's sister into the next room, where it was set forth with
great preparation. Then brother Ned took the head of the
table and brother Charles the foot; and Tim Linkinwater's sister sat on the left-hand of brothier Ned, and Tim Linkinwater
himself on his right; and an ancient butler of apoplectic appearance, and with very short legs, took up his position at the back
of brother Ned's arm-chair, and waiving his right arm preparatory to taking off the covers with a flourish, stood bolt upright
and motionless.
"For these and all other blessings, brother Charles," said
Ned.
"Lord, make us truly thankful, brother Ned," said Charles.
Whereupon the apoplectic butler whisked off the top of the
soup tureen, and shot all at once into a state of violent activity.
There was abundance of conversation, and little fear of its
ever flagging, for the good-humor of the glorious old twins drew
every body out, and Tim Linkinwater's sister went off into a
long and circumstantial account of Tim Linkinwater's infancy,
immediately after the very first glass of champagne-taking care
to premise that she was very much Tim's junior, and had only
become acquainted with the facts from their being preserved
and handed down in the family. This history concluded, brother -Ned related how that, exactly thirty-five years ago, Tim
Linkinwater was suspected to have received a love-letter, and
how that vague information had been brought to the countinghouse of his having been seen walking down Cheapside with an
uncommonly handsome spinster; at whicli there was a roar of
laughter; and Tim Linkinwater being charged with blushing,
and called upon to explain, denied that the accusation was true;
and further, that there would have been any harm in it if it had
been; which last position occasioned the superannuated bank
clerk to laugh tremendously and to declare that it was the very
best thing he had ever heard in his life, and that Tim Linkinwater might say a great many things before he said anything
which would beat that.
There was one little ceremony peculiar to the day, both the
matter and manner of which made a very strong impression
upon Nicholas. The cloth having been removed and the decanters sent round for the first time, a profound silence succeeded,
and in the cheerful faces of the brothers there appeared an expression, not of absolute melancholy, but of quiet thoughtfulness
very unusual at a festive table. As Nicholas, struck by this
sudden alteration, was wondering what it could portend, the
brothers rose together, and the one at the top of the table lean336THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE.
ing forward towards the other, and speaking in a low voice as if
he were addressing him individually, said"Brother Charles, my dear fellow, there is another association connected with this day which must never be forgotten, and
never can be forgotten, by you and me. This day, which
brought into the world a most faithful and exemplary fellow,
took from it the kindest and very best of parents-the very best
of parents to us both. I wish that she could have seen us in
our prosperity, and shared it, and had the happiness of knowing
how dearly we loved her in it, as we did when we were two
poor boys-but that was not to be. My dear brother- The
Memory of our Mother."
"Good God!" thought Nicholas, "and there are scores of
people of their own station, knowing all this, and twenty thousand times more, who wouldn't ask these men to dinner because
they eat with their knives and never went to school!"
But there was no time to moralize, for the joviality again betame very brisk, and the decanter of port being nearly out, brother Ned pulled the bell, which was instantly answered by the
apoplectic butler.
"David," said brother Ned.
" Sir," replied the butler.
"A magnum of the double-diamond, David, to drink the
health of Mr. Linkinwater."
Instantly, by a feat of dexterity which was the admiration of
all the company, and had been annually for some years past,
the apoplectic butler bringing his left hand from behind the
small of his back, produced the bottle with the corkscrew
already inserted; uncorked it at a jerk, and placed the magnum and the cork before his master with the dignity of conscious
cleverness.
"Ha!" said brother Ned, first examining the cork and afterwards filling his glass, while the old butler looked complacently
and amiably on, as if it were all his own property but the company were quite welcome to make free with it, " this looks well,
David."
"It ought to, sir," replied David. "You'd be troubled to
find such a glass of wine as is our double-diamond, and that Mr.
Linkinwater knows very well. That was laid down when Mr.
Linkinwater first come, that wine was, gentlemen."
" Nay, David, nay," interposed brother Charles.
"I wrote the entry in the cellar-book myself, sir, if you
please," said David, in the tone of a man, quite confident in the
strength of his facts. "Mr. Linkinwater had only been here

Poetry.-CHANMNG.
WE believe that poetry, far from injuring society, is one of
the great instru;ments of its refinement and exaltation.  It lifts
the mind above ordinary life, gives it a respite from depressing
cares, and awakens the consciousness of its affinity with what
is pure and noble.  In its legitimate and highest efforts, it has
the same tendency and aim with Christianity; that is, to spiritualize our nature.  True, poetry has been made the instrument
of vice, the pander of bad passions; but when genius thus
stoops, it dims its fires and parts with much of its power; and,
even when poetry is enslaved to licentiousness or misanthropy,
she cannot wholly forget her true vocation.  Strains of pure
feeling, touches of tenderness, images of innocent happiness,
sympathies with suffering virtue, bursts of scorn or indignation
at the hollowness of the world, passages true to our moral nature, often escape in an immoral work, and show us how hard
it is for a gifted spirit to divorce itself wholly from what is
good. Poetry has a natural alliance with our best affections.
It delights in the beauty and sublimity of the outward creation
and of the soul. It indeed portrays, with terrible energy, the
excesses of the passions; but they are passions which show a
mighty nature, which are full of power, which command awe,
and excite a deep, though shuddering sympathy.    Its great
tendency and purpose is to carry the mind beyond and above
the beaten, dusty, weary walks of ordinary life; to lift it into a
purer element; and to breathe into it more profound and generous emotion. It reveals to us the loveliness of nature, brings
back the freshness of early feeling, revives the relish of simple
pleasures, keeps unquenched the enthusiasm which warmed the
spring-time of our being, refines youthful love, strengthens our
interest in human nature by vivid delineations of its tenderest
and loftiest feelings, spreads our sympathies over all classes of
society, knits us by new ties with universal being, and, through
the brightness of its prophetic visions, helps faith to lay hold on
the future life.

twenty year, sir, when that pipe of double-diamond was laid
down."
"David is quite right-quite right, brother Charles," said
Ned: " are all the people here, David?"
"Outside the door, sir," replied the butler.
"Show'em in, David; show'em in."
At this bidding, the old butler placed before his master a
small tray of clean glasses, and opening the door admitted the
jolly porters and warehousemen whom Nicholas had seen below.
There were four in all, and as they came in, bowing and grinning, and blushing, the housekeeper and cook and housemaid
brought up the rear.
"Seven," said brother Ned, filling a corresponding number
of glasses with the double-diamond, " and David, eight-There.
Now, you're all of you to drink the health of your best friend,
Mr. Timothy Linkinwater, and wish him health and long life,
and many happy returns of this day, both for his own sake and
that of your old masters, who consider him an inestimable treasure. Tim Linkinwater, sir, your health. Devil take you, Tim
Linkinwater, sir, God bless you."
With this singular contradiction of terms, brother Ned gave
Tim Linkinwater a slap on the back which made him look for
the moment almost as apoplectic as the butler; and tossed off
the contents of his glass in a twinkling.
The toast was scarcely drunk with all honor to Tim Linkinwater, when the sturdiest and jolliest subordinate, elbowed himself a little in advance of his fellows, and exhibiting.a very hot
and flushed countenance, pulled a single lock of grey hair in the
middle of his forehead as a respectful salute to the company,
and delivered himself as follows-rubbing the palms of his
hands very hard on a blue cotton handkerchief as he did so:
"We're allowed to take a liberty once a year, gen'lemen, and
if you please we'll take it now; there being no time like the
present, and no two birds in the hand worth one in the bush, as
is well known--leastways in a contrairy sense, which the meaning is the same. (A pause-the butler unconvinced.) What
we mean to say is, that there never was (looking at the butler)such-(looking at the cook) noble-excellent-(looking everywhere and seeing nobody) free, generous, spirited masters as
them as has treated us so handsome this day. And here's
thanking'em for all their goodness as so constancy a diffusing of
itself everywhere, and wishing they may live long and die
happy!"
When th-: foregoing speech was over, and it might have been

much more elegant and much less to the purpose, the whole
body of subordinates under command of the apoplectic butler
gave three soft cheers; which,, to that gentleman's great indignation were not very regular, inasmuch as the women persisted
in giving an immense number of little shrill hurrahs among
themselves, in utter disregard of the time. This done, they
withdrew; shortly afterwards, Tim Linkinwater's sister withdrew; and in reasonable time after that, the sitting was broken
up for tea and coffee and a round game of cards.
At half past ten-late hours for the square-there appeared
a little tray of sandwiches and a bowl of bishop, which bishop
coming on the top of the double diamond and other excitements, had such an effect upon Tim Linkinwater, that he drew
Nicholas aside, and gave him to understand confidentially that
it was quite true about the uncommonly handsome spinster, and
that she was to the full as good-looking as she had been described-more so, indeed--but that she was in too much of a
hurry to change her condition, and consequently, while Tim was
courting her and thinking of changing his-got married to somebody else. "After all, I dare say it was my fault," said Tim.
"I'll show you a print I have got up stairs, one of these days.

paying the man a shilling over and above his fare in order that
he might take the utmost care of the lady, all but choked him
with a glass of spirits of uncommon strength, and then nearly
knocked all the breath out of his body in his energetic endeavors to knock it in again.
At length the coach rumbled off, and Tim Linkinwater's sister being now fairly on her way home, Nicholas and Tim Linkinwater's friend took their leaves together, and left old Tim and

dimmed, of that glorious confederacy which constitutes our political sun; still less do I wish to see it blotted out, and its
light obliterated forover. Has not the State of South Carolina
been one of the members of this Union in " days that tried
men's souls?"  Have not her ancestors fought alongside our
ancestors? Have we not, conjointly, won together many a glorious battle?  If we had to go into a civil war with such a
State, how would it terminate? Whenever it should have terminated, what would be her condition? If she should ever return to the Unionl, what would be the condition of her feelings
and affections? what the state of the heart of her people? She
has been with us before, when her ancestors mingled in the
throng of battle, and as I hope our posterity will mingle with
hers, for ages and centuries to come, in the united defense of
liberty, and for the honor and glory of the Union. I do not
wish to see her degraded or defaced as a member of this confederacy.
In conclusion, allow me to entreat and implore each individual member of this body to bring into the consideration of this
measure, which I have had the honor of proposing, the same
love of country, which, if I know myself, has actuated me, and
the same desire of restoring harmony to the Union, which has
prompted this effort. If we can forget for a moment-bus that
would be asking too much of human nature-if we could suppress, for one moment, party.feelings and party causes--and,
as I stand here before my God, I declare I have looked beyond
these considerations, and regarded only the vast interests of
this united people-I should hope, that under such feelings,
and with such dispositions, we may advantageously proceed to
the consideration of this bill, and heal, before they are yet
bleeding, the wounds of our distracted country.
340AN IRISH VILLAGE AND SCHOOL-HOUSE.
Picture of an Irish Village and School-house.
WILLIAM CARLETON.
THE village of Findramore was situated at the foot of a long
green hill, the outline of which formed a low arch, as it rose to
the eye against the horizon. This hill was studded with clumps
of beeches, and sometimes enclosed as a meadow.  In the
month of July, when the grass on it was long, many an hour
have I spent in solitary enjoyment, watching the wavy motion
produced upon its pliant surface by the sunny winds, or the
flight of the cloud shadows, like gigantic phantoms, as they
swept rapidly over it, whilst the murmur of the rocking trees,
and the glancing of their bright leaves in the sun, produced a
heartfelt pleasure, the very memory of which rises in my imagination like some fading recollection of a brighter world.
At the foot of this hill ran a clear deep-banked river, bounded on one side by a slip of rich level meadow, and on the other
by a kind of common for the village geese, whose white feathers
during the summer season lay scattered over its green surface.
It was also the play-ground for the boys of the village school;
for there ran that part of the river which, with very correct
judgment, the urchins had selected as their bathing-place. A
little slope or watering-ground in the bank brought them to the
edge of the stream, where the bottom fell away into the fearful depths of the whirlpool under the hanging oak on the other
bank. Well do I remember the first time I ventured to swim
across it, and even yet-do I see in imagination the two bunches
of water-flagons on which the inexperienced swimmers trusted
themselves in the water.
About two hundred yards above this, the boreen which led
from the village to the main road crossed the river by one of
those old narrow bridges whose arches rise like round ditches
across the road-an almost impassable barrier to horse and car.
On passing the bridge in a northern direction, you. found a
range of low thatched houses on each side of the road; and if
one o'clock, the hour of dinner, drew near, you might observe
columns of blue smoke curling up from a row of chimneys,
some made of wicker creels plastered over with a rich coat of
mud, some of old narrow bottomless tubs, and others, with a
greater appearance of taste, ornamented with thick circular
ropes of straw sewed together like bee's skeps with the peel of
a brier; and many having nothing but the open vent above.
But the smoke by no means escaped by its legitimate aperture,
341TH-E PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
for you might observe little clouds of it bursting out of the doors
and windows; the panes of the latter being mostly stopped
at other times with old hats and rags, were now left entirely
open for the purpose of giving it a free escape.
Before the doors, on right and left, was a series of dunghills,
each with its concomitant sink of green rotten water; and if it
happened that a stout-looking woman with watery eyes, and a
yellow cap hung loosely upon her matted locks, came, with a
chubby urchin on one arm and a pot of dirty water in her
hand, its unceremonious ejection in the aforesaid sink would be
apt to send you up the village with your finger and thumb (for
what purpose you would yourself perfectly understand) closely,
but not knowingly, applied to your nostrils. But independently
of this, you would be apt to have other reasons for giving your
horse, whose heels are by this time surrounded by a dozen barking curs, and the same number of shouting urchins, a pretty
sharp touch of the spurs, as well as for complaining bitterly of
the odor of the atmosphere. It is no landscape without figures;
and you might notice-if you are, as I suppose you to be, a
man of observation-in every sink as you pass along a " slip of
a pig" stretched in the middle of the mud, the very beau ideal
of luxury, giving occasionally a long luxuriant grunt, highly expressive of his enjoyment; or perhaps an old farrower, lying in
indolent repose, with half a dozen young ones jostling each other
for their draught, and punching her belly with their little
snouts, reckless of the fumes they are creating; whilst the loud
crow of the cock, as he confidently flaps his wings on his own
dunghill, gives the warning note for the hour of dinner.
As you advance, you will also perceive several faces thrust
out of the doors, and rather than miss a sight of you, a grotesque visage peeping by a short cut through the paneless windows, or a tattered female flying to snatch up her urchin that
has been tumbling itself heels up in the dust of the road, lest
" the gintleman's horse might ride over it;" and if you happen
to look behind, you may observe a shaggy-headed youth in
tattered frize, with one hand thrust indolently in his breast,
standing at the door in conversation with the inmates, a broad
grin of sarcastic ridicule on his face, in the act of breaking a
joke or two upon yourself or your horse; or perhaps your jaw
may be saluted with a lump of clay, just hard enough not to
fall asunder as it flies, c,ast by some ragged gorsoon from behind
a hedge, who squats b imself in a ridge of corn to avoid detection.
Seated upon a hob at the door you may observe a toil-worn
342AN IRISH VILLAGE AND SCHOOL-HOUSE.
man without coat or waistcoat, his red muscular, sun-burnt shoulder peering through the remnant of a shirt, mending his shoes
with a piece of twisted flax, called a lingel, or perhaps sewing
two footless stockings, or martyeens, to his coat, as a substitute
for sleeves.
In the gardens, which are usually fringed with nettles, you
will see a solitary laborer, working with that carelessness and
apathy that characterize an Irishman when he labors for himself,
leaning upon his spade to look after you, and glad of any excuse to be'dle.
The houses, however, are not all such as I have describedfar- from it. You see here and there, between the more humble
cabins, a stout comfortable-looking farm-house with ornamental
thatching and well-glazed windows; adjoining to which is a
hay-yard with five or six large stacks of corn, well-trimmed and
roped, and a fine yellow weather-beaten old hayrick, half-cutnot taking into account twelve or thirteen circular strata of
stones that mark out the foundations on which others had been
raised. Neither is the rich smell of oaten or wheaten bread,
which the good-wife is baking on the griddle, unpleasant to
your nostrils; nor would the bubbling of a large pot, in which
you might see, should you chance to enter, a prodigious square
of fat, yellow, and almost transparent bacon tumbling about,
be an unpleasant object; truly, as it hangs over a large fire,
with well-swept hearthstone, it is in good keeping with the
white settle and chairs, and the dresser with noggins, wooden
trenchers, and pewter dishes, perfectly clean, and as well polished as a French courtier.
As you leave the village, you have, to the left, a view of the
hill which I have already described, and to the right a level expanse of fertile country, bounded by a good view of respectable
mountains peering decently into the sky; and in a line that
forms an acute angle from the point of the road where you ride
is a delightful valley, in the bottom of which shines a pretty
lake; and a little beyond, on the slope of a green hill, rises a
splendid house, surrounded by a park well-wooded and stocked
with deer. You have now topped the little hill above the village, and a straight line of level road, a mile long, goes forward
to a country town which lies immediately behind that white
church with its spire cutting into the sky before you. You descend on the other side, and having advanced a few perches,
look to the left, where you see a long thatched chapel, only
distinguished from a dwelling-house by its want of chimneys,
and a small stone cross that stands on the top of the eastern
343THE' PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
gable; behind it is a grave-yard, and beside it a snug publichouse, well white-washed; then, to the right, you observe a
door apparently in the side of a clay bank, which rises considerably above the pavement of the road. What! you ask yourself, can this be a human habitation! But ere you have time to
answer the question, a confused buzz of voices from within
reaches your ear, and the appearance of a little gorsoon with a
red close-cropped head and Milesian face, having in his hand a
short white stick, or the thigh-bone of a horse, which you at once
recognize as the " pass" of a village school, gives you the full
information. He has an ink-horn, covered with leather, dangling
at the button-hole (for he has long since played away the buttons) of his frize jacket-his mouth is circumscribed with a
streak of. ink-his pen is stuck knowingly behind his ear-his
shins are dotted over with fire-blisters, black, red, and blue-on
each heel a kibe--his "leather crackers"-videlicet, breechesshrunk up upon him, and only reaching as far down as the caps
of his knees. Having spied you, he places his hand over his
brows, to throw back the dazzling light of the sun, and peers at
you from under it, till he breaks out into a laugh, exclaiming, half to himself, half to you"You a gintleman!--no, nor one of your breed never was,
you procthorin' thief you!"
You are now immediately opposite the door of the seminary,
when half a dozen of those seated next it notice you.
" Oh, sir, here's a gintleman on a horse!--masther, sir, here's
a gintleman on a horse, wid boots and spurs on him, that's looking in at us."
"Silence!" exclaims the master; "back from the door--
boys rehearse-every one of you rehearse, I say, you Bceotians,
till the gintleman goes past!"
"I want to go out, if you plase, sir."
"No, you don't, Phelim."
"I do, indeed, sir."
"What! is it afther conth,radictin' me you'd be? Don't you
see the'porter's' out, and you can't go."
"Well,'tis Mat Meehan has it, sir; and he's out this halfhour, sir; I can't stay in, sir."
-" You want to be idling your time looking at the gintleman,
Phelim."
"No, indeed, sir."
" Phelim, I know you of ould-go to your sate. I tell you,
Phelim, you were born for the encouragement of the hemp
manufacture, and you'll die promoting it."
344ACCOMPLISI-IMENTS OF HUDIBRAS.
In the mean time the master puts his head out of the door,
his body stooped to a "half-bend"--a phrase, and the exact
curve which it forms, I leave for the present to your own sagacity-and surveys you until you pass.        That is an Irish
hedge-school, and the personage who follows you with his eye
a hedge-schoolmaster.
Accomplishments of Hudibras.-BuTLE-P.
A WIGHT he was, whose very sight would
Entitle him, mirror of knighthood;
That never bowed his stubborn knee
To anything but chivalry;
Nor put up blow, but that which laid
Right-worshipful on shoulder-blade:
Chief of domestic knights and errant,
Either for chartel or for warrant:
Great on the bench, great on the saddle,
That could as well bind o'er,; as swaddle:
Mighty he was at both of these,
And styled of war as well as peace.
(So some rats, of amphibious nature,
Are either for the land or water.)
But here our authors make a doubt,
Whether he were more wise or stout;
Some hold the one, and some the other:
But howsoe'er they make a pother,
The difference was so small, his brain
Outweighed his rage but half a grain;
Which made some take him for a tool
That knaves do work with, called a fool.
For't has been held by many, that
As Montaigne, playing with his cat,
Complains she thought him but an ass,
Much more she would Sir Hudibras.
(For that's the name our valiant knight
To all his challenges did write.)
But they're mistaken very much;'Tis plain enough he was no such:
We grant, although he had much wit,
He was very shy of uising it;
As being loath to wear it out,
And therefore bore it not about;
Unless on holidays, or so,
As men their best apparel do;
Beside,'tis known he could speak Greek
As naturally as pigs squeak;
15*
345THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST
That Latin was no more difficile,
Than to a blackbird'tis to whistle;
Being rich in both, he never scanted
His bounty unto such as wanted;
But much of either would afford
To many, that had not one word.
He was in logic a great critic,
Profoundly skilled in analytic;
He could distinguish, and divide
A hair'twixt south and southwest side;
On either which he would dispute
Confute, change hands, and still confute;
He'd unidertake to prove by force
Of argument a man's no horse;
He'd prove a buzzard is no fowl,
And that a lord may be an owl,
A calf an alderman, a goose a justice,
And rooks committee-men and trustees.
He'd run in debt by disputation,
And pay with ratiocination:
All this by syllogism, true
In mood and figure, he would do.
For rhetoric, he could not ope
His mouth, but out there flew a trope;
And when he happened to break off
I' th' middle of his speech, or cough,
H' had hard words, ready to show why,
And tell what rules he did it by:
Else, when with greatest art he spoke,
You'd think he talked like other folk;
For all a rhetorician's rules
Teach nothing but to name his tools.
But, when he pleased to show't, his speech
In loftiness of sound was rich;
A Babylonish dialect,
Which learned pedants much affect:
It was a party-colored dress
Of patched and piebald languages;'Twas English cut on Greek and Latin,
Like fustian heretofore on satin.
It had an old promiscuous tone,
As if he had talked three parts in one;
Which made some think, when he did gabble
Th' had heard three laborers of Babel;
Or Cerberus himself pronounce
A leash of languages at once.
This he as volubly would vent
As if his stock would ne'er be spent;
And truly, to support that charge,
He had supplies as vast and large:
For he could coin or counterfeit
New words, with little or no wit;
Words so debasei and hard, no stone

Tribute to the Universal Genius of Shakspeare.
FRANCIS JEFFREY.
MANY persons are very sensible of the effect of fine poetry
upon their feelings, who do not well know how to refer these
feelings to their causes; and it is always a delightful thing to
be made to see clearly the sources, from which our delight has
proceeded, and to trace the mingled stream that has flowed
upon our hearts to the remoter fountains from which it has been
gathered; and when this is done with warmth as well as precision, and embodied in an eloquent description of the beauty
which is explained, it forms one of the most attractive, and not
the least instructive, of literary exercises. In all'works of merit,
however, and especially in all works of original genius, there are
a thousand retiring and less obtrusive graces, which escape hasty
and superficial observers, and only give out their beauties to
fond and patient contemplation; a thousand slight and harmonizing touches, the merit and the effect -of which are equally imperceptible to vulgar eyes; and a thousand indications of the continual
presence of that poetical spirit which can only be recognized by
those who are in some measure under its influence, and have
prepared themselves to receive it, by worshipping meekly at the
shrines which it inhabits.
In the exposition of these there is room enough' for originality,
and more room than Mr. Hazlitt has yet filled. In many points,
however, he has acquitted himself excellently; particularly in
the development of the principal characters with which Shakspeare has peopled the fancies of all English readers-but principally, we think, in the delicate sensibility with which he has
traced, and the natural eloquence with which he has pointed
out, that familiarity with beautiful forms and images-that eternal recurrence to what is sweet or majestic in the simple aspect
of nature-that indestructible love of flowers and odors, and
347THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
We are aware that it is objected to poetry, that it gives wrong
views and excites false expectat;ions of life, peoples the mind
with shadows and illusions, and builds up imagination on the
ruins of wisdom. That there is a wisdom against which poetry
wars, the wisdom of the senses, which makes physical comfort
and gratification the supreme good, and wealth the chief interest of life, we do not deny; nor do we deem it the least service which poetry renders to mankind, that it redeems them
from the thraldom of this earthborn prudence. But, passing
over this topic, we would observe, that the complaint against
poetry, as abounding in illusion and deception, is, in the main,
groundless. In many poems there is more of truth than in
many histories and philosophic theories. The fictions of genius
are often the vehicles of the sublimest verities, and its flashes
often open new regions of thought, and throw new light on the
mysteries of our being. In poetry, when the letter is falsehood, the spirit is often profoundest wisdom.  And, if truth
thus dwells in the boldest fictions of the poet, much more may
it be expected in his delineations of life; for the present life,
which is the first stage of the immortal mind, abounds in the
materials of poetry, and it is the high office of the bard to detect this divine element among the grosser labors and pleasures
of our earthly being.  The present life is not wholly prosaic,
precise, tame, and finite. To the gifted eye it abounds in the
poetic.  The affections which spread beyond ourselves and
stretch far into futurity; the workings of mighty passions,
which seem to arm the soul with an almost superhuman energy;
the innocent and irrepressible joy of infancy; the bloom, and
buoyancy, and dazzling hopes of youth; the throbbings of the
heart, when it first wakes to love and dreams of a happiness
too vast for earth; woman, with her beauty, and grace, and
gentleness, and fullness of feeling, and depth of affection, and
blushes of purity, and the tones and looks which only a mother's heart can inspire; these are all poetical. It is not true that
the poet paints a life which does not exist. He only extracts
and concentrates, as it were, life's ethereal essence, arrests and
condenses its volatile fragrance, brings together its scattered
beauties, and prolongs its more refined but evanescent joys.
And in this he does well; for it is good to feel that life is not
wholly usurped by cares for subsistence and physical gratifications, but admits, in measures which may be indefinitely enlarged, sentiments: and delights worthy of a higher being.
This power of poetry to refine our views of life and happiness,
is more and more needed as society advances.  It is needed to
42THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
dews and clear waters, and soft airs and sounds, and bright
skies, and woodland solitudes, and moonlight bowers, which are
the material elements of poetry-and that fine sense of their undefinable relation to mental emotion, which is its essence and
vivifying soul--and which, in the midst of Shakspeare's most
busy and atrocious scenes, falls like gleams of sunshine on rocks
and. ruins-contrasting with all that is rugged and repulsive,
and reminding us of the existence of purer and brighter elements
-which he alone has poured out from the richness of his own'
mind without effort or restraint, and contrived to intermingle
with the play of all the passions, and the vulgar course of this
world's affairs, without deserting for an instant the proper business of the scene, or appearing to pause or digress from love of
ornament or need of repose; he alone, who, when the subject
requires it, is always keen, and worldly, and practical, and who
yet, without changing his hand, or stopping his course, scatters
around him as he goes all sounds and shapes of sweetness, and
conjures up landscapes of immortal fragrance and freshness, and
peoples them.with spirits of glorious aspect and attractive grace,
and is a thousand times more full of imagery and splendor than
those who, for the sake of such qualities, have shrunk back from
the delineation of character or passion, and declined the discussion of human duties and cares. More full of wisdom, and
ridicule, and sagacity, than all the moralists and satirists in existence, he is more wild, airy, and inventive, and more pathetic
and fantastic, than all the poets of all regions and ages of the
world; and has all those elements so happily mixed up in him,
and bears his high faculties so temperately, that the most severe'
reader cannot complain of him for want of strength or of reason,
nor the most sensitive for defect of ornament or ingenuity. Everything in him is in unmeasured abundance and unequalled
perfection; but everything so balanced and kept in subordination, as not to jostle or disturb or take the place of another.
The most exquisite poetical conceptions, images, and descriptions, are given with such brevity, and introduced with such
skill, as merely to adorn without loading the sense they accompany. Although his sails are purple, and perfumed, and his
prow of beaten gold, they waft him on his voyage, not less, but
more rapidly and directly, than if they had been composed of
baser materials. All his excellences, like those of Nature herself, are thrown out together; and instead of interfering with,
support and recommend each other. His flowers are not tied
up in garlands, nor his fruits crushed into baskets, but spring
livino from the soil, in all the dew and freshness of youth;

while the graceful foliage in which they lurk, and the ample
branches, the rough and vigorous stem, and the wide-spreading
roots on which they depend, are present along with them, and

The Pioneer.-B     RAINARD.
FAR away from the hillside, the lake, and the hamlet,
The rock and the brook, and yon meadow so gay;
From the footpath, that winds by the side of the streamlet,
From his hut and the grave of his friend far away;
He is gone where the footsteps of man never ventured,
Where the glooms of the wild tangled forest are centered,
Where no beam of the sun or the sweet moon has entered,
No bloodhound has roused up the deer with his bay.
He has left the green valley, for paths where the bison
Roams through the prairies, or leaps o'er the flood;
Where the snake in the swamp sucks the deadliest poison,
And the cat of the mountains keeps watch for his food.
But the leaf shall be greener, the sky shall be purer,
The eye shall be clearer, the rifle be surer,
And stronger the arm of the fearless endurer,
That trusts naught but Heaven, in his way through the wood.
Light be the heart of the poor lonely wanderer,
Firm be his step through each wearisome mile,
Far from the cruel man, far from the plunderer,
Far from the track of the mean and the vile;
And when death, with the last of its terrors, assails him,
And all but the last throb of memory fails him,
He'll think of the friend, far away, that bewails him,
And light up the cold touch of death with a smile.
And there shall the dew shed its sweetness and lustre,
There for his pall shall the oak leaves be spread;
The sweetbriar shall bloom, and the wild grape shall cluster,
And o er him the leaves of the ivy be shed.
There shall they mix with the fern and the heather,
There shall the young eagle shed its first feather,
The wolf with his wild cubs shall lie there together,
And moan o'er the spot where the hunter is laid.

Character of Franklin.-BANcRoFT.
WITH placid tranquillity, Benjamin Franklin looked quietly
and deeply into the secrets of nature. His clear understanding
was never perverted by passion, or corrupted by the pride of
theory. The son of a rigid Calvinist, the grandson of a tolerant
Quaker, he had from boyhood been familiar, not only with theological subtilties, but with a catholic respect for freedom of
mind. Skeptical of tradition as the basis of faith, he respected
reason rather than authority; and, after a momentary lapse into
fatalism, escaping from the mazes of fixed decrees and free will,
he gained, with increasing years, an increasing trust in the overruling providence of God. Adhering to none "of all the religions" in the colonies, he yet devoutly, though without form,
adhered to religion. But though famous as a disputant, and
having a natural aptitude for metaphysics, he obeyed the ten-.
dency of his age, and sought by observation to win an insight
into the mysteries of being. Loving truth, without prejudice.
and without bias, he discerned intuitively the identity of the
laws of nature with those of which humanity is conscious; so
that his mind was like a mirror, in which the universe, as it reflected itself, revealed her laws. He was free from mysticism,
even to a fault. His morality, repudiating ascetic severities,
and the system which enjoins them, was indulgent to appetites
of which he abhorred the sway; but his affections were of a
calmn intensity; in all his career, the love of man gained the
mastery over personal interest. He had not the imagination
which inspires the bard or kindles the orator; but an exquisite
propriety, parsimonious of ornament, gave ease of expression
and graceful simplicity even to his most careless writings. In
life, also, his tastes were delicate. Indifferent to the pleasures
of the table, he relished the delights of music and harmony, of
which he enlarged the instruments. His blandness of temper,
his modesty, the benignity of his manners, made him the favorite of intelligent society; and, with healthy cheerfulness, he
derived pleasure from books, from philosophy, from conversation-now calmly administering consolation to the sorrower,
now indulging in the expression of light-hearted gayety.  In his
intercourse, the universality of his perceptions bore, perhaps,
the character of humor; but, while he clearly discerned the
contrast between the grandeur of the universe and the feebleness of man, a serene benevolence saved him from contempt of
his race, or disgust at its toils. To superficial observers, he
350SONG OF THE BELL.
might have seemed as an alien from speculative truth, limiting
himself to the world of the senses; and yet, in study, and
among men, his mind always sought, with unaffected simplicity,
to discover and apply the general principles by which nature
and affairs are controlled-now deducing from the theory of
caloric improvements in fireplaces and lanterns, and now advancing human freedom by firm inductions from the inalienable
rights of man. Never professing enthusiasm, never making a
parade of sentiment, his practical wisdom was sometimes mistaken for the -offspring of selfish prudence; yet his hope was
steadfast, like that hope which rests on the Rock of Ages, and
his conduct was as unerring as though the light that led him
was a light from heaven. He never anticipated action by theoiies of self-sacrificing virtue; and yet, in the moments of intense
activity, he, from the highest abodes of ideal truth, brought
down and applied to the affairs of life the sublimest principles
of goodness, as noiselessly and unostentatiously as became the
man who, with a kite and hempen string, drew the lightning
from the skies. He separated himself so little from his age,
that he has been called the representative of materialism; and
yet, when he thought on religion, his mind passed beyond reliance on sects to faith in God; when he wrote on politics, he
founded the freedom of his country on principles that know no
change; when he turned an observing eye on nature, he passed
always from the effect to the cause, from individual appearances to universal laws; when he reflected on history, his philosophic mind found gladness and repose in the clear anticipation
of the progress of humanity.

Stands the mould of well-burnt clay.

Sweat must freely flow,
If to your master praise be given:

To the work we now prepare
A serious thought is surely due;
And cheerfully the toil we'll share,
If cheerful words be mingled too.
Then let us still with care observe
What from our strength, yet weakness spring3
For he respect can ne'er deserve
Who hands alone to labor brings.'Tis only this which honors man;
His mind with heavenly fire was warmed,
That he with deepest thought might scan
The work which his own hand has formed.
With splinters of the driest pine
Now feed the fire below;
Then the rising flame shall shine,
And the melting ore shall flow.
Boils the brass within,
Quickly add the tin;
That the thick metallic mass
Rightly to the mould may pass.
What with the aid of fire's dread power
We in the dark, deep pit now hide,
Shall, on some lofty, sacred tower,
Tell of our skrill and form our pride.
And it shall last to days remote,
Shall thrill the ear of many a race;
Shall sound with sorrow's mournful note,
And call to pure devotion's grace.
Whatever to the sons of earth
Their changing destiny brings down,
To the deep, solemn clang gives birth,
That rings from out this metal crown.
See, the boiling surface, whitening,
Shows the whole is mixing well;
Add the salts, the metal brightening,
Ere flows out the liquid bell.
Clear from foam or scum
Must the mixture come,
That with a rich- metallic note
The sound aloft in air may float.
Now with joy and festive mirth
Salute that loved and lovely child,
Whose earliest moments on the earth
Are passed in sleep's dominion mild.
While on Time's lap he rests his head,
The fatal sisters spin their thread;
A mother's love, with softest'rays,
Gilds o'er the morning of his days.
But years with arrowy haste are fled.

After long wandering, home he turns,
Arrives a stranger and in doubt.
There, lovely in her beauty's youth,
A form of heavenly mould he meets,
Of modest air and simple truth;
The blushing maid he bashful greets.
A nameless feeling seizes strong
On his young heart. He walks alone;
To his moist eyes emotions throng;
His joy in ruder sports has flown.
He follows, blushing; where she goes;
And should her smile but welcome him,
The fairest flower, the dewy rose,
To deck her beauty seems too dim.
O tenderest passion! Sweetest hope I
The golden hours of earliest love!
Heaven's self to him appears to ope;
He feels a bliss this earth above.
O, that it could eternal last!
That youthful love were never past I
See how brown the liquid turns I
Now this rod I thrust within;
If it's glazed before it burns,
Then the casting may begin.
Quick, my lads, and steady,
If the mixture's ready!
When the strong and weaker blend,
Then we hope a happy end:
Whenever strength with softness joins,
When with the rough the mild combines,
Then all is union sweet and strong.
Consider, ye who join your hands,
If hearts are twined in mutual hands;
For passion's brief, repentance long.
How lovely in the maiden's hair
The bridal garland plays I
And merry bells invite us there,
Where mingle festive lays.
Alas I that all life's brightest hours
Are ended with its earliest May I
That from those sacred nuptial bowers
The dear deceit should pass away I
Though passion may fly,
Yet love will endure;
The flower must die,
The fruit to insure.
The man must without,
Into struggling life;
With toiling and strife,
353THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
He must plan and contrive;
Must be prudent to thrive;
With boldness must dare,
Good fortune to share.'Tis by means such as these, that abundance is poured
In a full, endless stream, to increase all his hoard,
While his house to a palace spreads out.
Within doors governs
The modest, careful wife,
The children's kind mother;
And wise is tne rule
Of her housellold school.
She teaches the girls,
And she warns the boys;
She directs all the bands
Of diligent hands,
And increases their gain
By her orderly reign.
And she fills with her treasures her sweet-scented chests
From the toil of her spinning-wheel scarcely she rests;
And she gathers in order, so cleanly and bright,
The softest of wool, and the linen snow-white:
The useful and pleasant she mingles ever,
And is slothful never.
The father, cheerful from the door,
His wide-extended homestead eyes;
Tells all his smiling fortunes o'er;
The fuiture columns in his trees,
His barn's well-furnished stock he sees,
His granaries e'en now o'erflowing,
VWhile yet the waving corn is growing.
He boasts with swelling pride,
"Firm as the mountain's side
Against the shock of fate
Is now my happy state."
Who can discern futurity?
Who can insure prosperity?
Quick misfortune's arrow flies.
Now we may begin to cast;
All is right and well prepared;
Yet ere the anxious moment's past,
A pious hope by all be shared.
Strike the stopper clear!
God preserve us here!
Sparkling, to the rounded mould
It rushes hot, like liquid gold.
How useful is the power of flame,
If human skill control and tame!
And much of all that man can boast,
Without this child of Heaven, were lost.
But frightful is her changing mien,
When, bursting from her bonds, she's'seen
354SONG OF THE BELL.
To quit the safe and quiet hearth,
And wander lawless o'er the earth.
Woe to those whom then she meets I
Against her fury who can stand?
Along the thickly peopled streets
She madly hurls her fearful brand.
Then the elements, with joy,
Man's best handiwork destroy.
From the clouds
Falls amain
The blessed rain:
From the clouds alike
Lightnings strike.
Ringing loud the fearful knell,
Sounds the bell.
Dark blood-red
Are all the skies;
But no dawning light is spread.
What wild cries
Fromn the streets arise!
Smoke dims the eyes.
Flickering mounts the fiery glow
Along the street's extended row,
Fast as fiercest winds can blow.
Bright, as with a furnace glare,
And scorching, is the heated air;
Beams are falling, children crying,
Windows breaking, mothers flying,
Creatures moaning, crushed and dyingAll is uproar, hurry, flight,
And light as day the dreadful night.
Along the eager living lane,
Though all in vain,
Speeds the bucket. The engine's power
Sends the artificial shower.
But see, the heavens still threatening lower I
The winds rush roaring to the flame.
Cinders on the store-house frame,
And its drier stores, fall thick;
While kindling, blazing, mounting quick,
As though it would, at one fell sweep,
All that on the earth is found
Scatter wide in,ruin round,
Swells the flame to heaven's blue deep,
With giant size.
Hope now dies.
Man must yield to Heaven's decrees.
Submissive, yet appalled, he sees
His fairest works in ashes sleep.
All burnt over
Is the place,
The storm' wild home. How changed its face!
355THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST
In the empty, ruined wall
Dwells dark horror;
While heaven's clouds in shadow fall
Deep within.
One look,
In memory sad,
Of all he had,
The unhappy sufferer tookThen found his heart might yet be glad.
However hard his lot to bear,
His choicest treasures still remain:
He calls for each with anxious pain,
And every loved one's with him there.
To the earth it's now committed.
With success the mould is filled.
To skill and care alone's permitted
A perfect work with toil to build.
Is the casting right?
Is the mould yet tight?
Ah! while now with hope we wait,
Mischance, perhaps, attends its fate.
To the dark lap of mother earth
We now confide what we have made;
As in earth too the seed is laid,
In hope the seasons will give birth
To fruits that soon may be displayed.
And yet more precious seed we sow
With sorrow in the world's wide field;
And hope, though in the grave laid low,
A flower of heavenly hue't will yield.
Slow and heavy
Hear it swell I'Tis the solemn
Passing bell!
Sad we follow, with these sounds of woe,
Those who on this last, long journey go.
Alas! the wife-it is the dear oneAh I it is the faithfill mother,
Whom the shadowy king of fear
Tears from all that life holds dear;
From' the husband-from the young,
l'he tender blossoms, that have sprung
From their mutual, faithful love,'Twas hers to nourish, guide, improve.
Ah! the chain which bound them all
Is for ever broken now;
She cannot hear their tender call,
Nor see them in affliction bow.
Her true affection guards no more;
Her watchful care w'ikes not again:
356SJNG OF THE BELL
O'er all the once loved orphan's store
The indifferent stranger now must reign.
Till the bell is safely cold,
May our heavy labor rest;
Free as the bird, by none controlled,
Each may do what pleases best.
With approaching night,
Twinkling stars are bright.
Vespers call the boys to play;
The master's toils end not with day.
Cheerful in the forest gloom,
The wanderer turns his weary steps
To his loved, though lowly home.
Bleating flocks draw near the fold;
And the herds,
Wide-horned, and smooth, slow-pacing come
Lowing from the hill,
The accustomed stall to fill.
Heavy rolls
Along the wagon,
Richly loaded.
On the sheaves,
With gayest leaves
They form the wreath;
And the youthful reapers dance
Upon the heath.
Street and market all are quiet,
And round each domestic light
Gathers now a circle fond,
While shuts the creaking city-gate.
Darkness hovers
O'er the earth.
Safety still each sleeper covers
As with light,
That the deeds of crime discovers;
For wakes the law's protecting night.

withstand the encroachments of heartless and artificial manners, which make civilization so tame and uninteresting. It is
needed to counteract the tendency of physical science, which,
being now sought, not as formerly, for intellectual gratification,
but for multiplying bodily comforts, requires a new development of imagination, taste, and poetry, to preserve men from
sinking into an earthly, material, Epicurean life.
The   Youthful ]Visionary.-scoTT
WVOE to the youth whom Fancy gains,
Winning from Reason's hand the reins,
Pity and woe! for such a mind
Is soft, contemplative, and kind;
And woe to those who train such youth,
And spare to press the rights of truth,
The mind to strengthen and anneal,
While on the stithy glows the steel!
O teach himhn, while your lessons last,
To judge the present by the past;
Remind him of each wish pursued,
How rich it glowed with promised good;
Remind him of each wish enjoyed,
How soon his hopes possession cloyed!
Tell him, we play unequal game,
Whene'er we shoot by Fancy's aim;
And ere he strip him for her race,
Show the conditions of the chace.
Two Sisters by the goal are set,
Cold Disappointment and Regret;
One disenchants the winner's eyes.
And strips of all its worth the prize,
While one augments its gaudy show,
More to enhance the loser's woe.
The victor sees his fairy gold
Transformed, when won, to drossy mold,
But still the vanquished mourns his loss,.And rues, as gold, that glittering dross.
More wouldst thou know-yon tower survey
Yon couch unpressed since parting day,
Yon untrimmed lamp, whose yellow gleam
Is mingling with the cold moonbeam,
And yon thin form!-the hectic red
On his pale cheek unequal spread;
The head reclined, the loosened hair,
The imbs relaxed, the mournful air.
43THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Master and workmen all agree,
Under sweet Freedom's holy care
And each, content in his degree,
Warns every scorner to beware.
Labor is the poor man's prideSuccess by toil alone is won.
Kings glory in possessions wideWe glory in onr work well done.
Gentle peace!
Sweet union!
Linger, linger,
Kindly over this our home!
Never may the day appear,
When the hordes of cruel war
Through this quiet vale shall rush;
When the sky,
With the evening's softened air,
Blushing red,
Shall reflect the frightful glare
Of burning towns in ruin dread.
Now break up the useless mould:
Its only purpose is fulfilled.
May our eyes, well pleased, behold
A work to prove us not unskilled.
Wield the hanmmer, wield,
Till the frame shall yield I
That the bell to light may rise,
The form in thousand fragments flies.
The master may destroy the mould
With careful hand, and judgment wise.
But, woe!-in streams of fire, if rolled,
The glowing metal seek the skies!
Loud bursting with the crash of thunder,
It throws aloft the broken ground;
Like a volcano rends asunder,
And spreads in burning ruin round.
When reckless power by force prevails,
The reign of peace and art is o'er;
And when a mob e'en wrong assails,
The public welfare is no more.
Alas I when in the peaceful state
Conspiracies are darkly forming;
The oppressed no longer patient wait;
With fury every breast is storming.
Then whirls the bell with frequent clang;
And uproar, with her howling voice,
Has changed the note, that peaceful rang,
To wild confusion's dreadful noise.
358SONG OF THE BELL.
Freedom and equal rights they callAnd peace gives way to sudden war;
The street is crowded, and the hallAnd crime is unrestrained by law:
E'en woman, to a fury turning,
But mocks at every dreadful deed;
Against the hated madly burning,
With horrid joy she sees them bleed.
Now naught is sacred; broken lies
Each holy law of honest worth;
The bad man rules, the good man flies,
And every vice walks boldly forth.
There's danger in the lion's wrath,
Destruction in the tiger's jaw;
But worse than death to cross the path
Of man, when passion is his law.
Woe, woe to those who strive to light
The torch of truth by passion's fire!
It guides not; it but glares through night
To kindle freedom's funeral pyre.
God has given us joy to-night!
See how, like the golden grain
From the husk, all smooth and bright,
The shining metal now is ta'en I
From top to well formed rim,
Not a spot is dim;
E'en the motto, neatly raised,
Shows a skill may well be praised.
Around, around,
Companions all, take your ground,
And name the bell with joy profound I
CoNCORDIA is the word we've found
Most meet to express the harmonious sound
That calls to those in friendship bound.
Be this henceforth the destined end
To which the finished work we send
Higll over every meaner thing,
In the blue canopy of heaven,
Near to the thunder let it swing,
A neighbor to the stars be given.
Let its clear voice above proclaim,
With brightest troops of distant suns,
The praise of our Creator's name,
While round each circling season runs,
To soleimn thoughts of heartfelt power
Let its deep note full oft invite,
And tell, with every passing hour,
Of hastening time's unceasing flight.
359THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST
Still let it mark the course of fate;
Its cold unsympathizing voice
Attend on every changing state
Of human passions, griefs, and joys.
And as the mighty sound it gives
Dies gently on the listening ear,
We feel how quickly all that lives
Must change, and fade, and disappear.
Now, lads, join your strength around!
Lift the bell to upper air!.And in the kingdom wide of sound
Once placed, we'll leave it there.
All together! heave!
Its birthplace see it leave!Joy to all within its bound!
Peace its first, its latest sound!
Our Domestic Resources.-H. CLAY.
Suca is the extent and variegations of our territory--such the
cheapness and generosity of the soil--such the.facility with
which sites for manufacturing buildings can be obtained, and
such the aid which those sites would receive from the extensive
application of steam-such the low prices of living in those
places where manufactories will eventually rise, and the consequent moderate terms on which labor could be afforded-such
the increasing economy with which tuition is brought to the
doors of our citizens-so sinuous and diversified their enterprise
-so high the inducement for the manufacturing species of emigration-and so little the necessity of affecting health, as in
England and the European continent, by crowding numbers
together-and withal, so free and equal our laws--that the
society cannot but believe, that the visions of the theorists, and,
what is more to be feared, the insinuations of the interested and
designing on the points of practicability, morals, and health, may
be made to fall before the more rational and patriotic spirit of
manufacture.  *   *  *   As to the owners of the establishments, it can never be feared, in a country like ours, where agriculture must for ages be so decisively predominant, and where
commerce and the mechanic interests would so equably keep
them in check, that they would ever become, by overweening
influence, obnoxious to our free institutions. But, perhaps the

contrary would result, from the strong necessity, which for centuries will exist, of, in some slight degree, counterpoising the
colossal weight of the agricultural influence, by counteractive
interests.

To divide and conquer, is the maxim     of our constitutional
enemy.   The encouragement of our domestic resources will
make us a united people.    This nation will become one great
family, giving and taking from each other. Let us, then,
treasure up the maxim   of wisdom, that concert is stronger than
numbers.
The Fallen Leaves.-MRs. NORTON.
WE stand among the fallen leaves,
Young children at our play,
And laugh to see the yellow things
Go rustling on their way:
Right merrily we hunt them down,
The autumn winds and we,
Nor pause to gaze where snow-drifts lie,
Or sunbeams gild the tree:
With dancing feet we leap along
Where withered boughs are strown;
Nor past nor future checks our song--
The present is our own.
We stand among the fallen leaves
In youth's enchanted springWhen hope (who wearies at the last)
First spreads her eagle wing.
We tread with steps of conscious strength
Beneath the leafless trees,
And the color kindles in our cheek
As blows the winter breeze;
While, gazing towards the cold gray sky
Clouded with snow and rain,
We wish the old year all past by,
And the young spring come again.
We stand among the fallen leaves
In manhood's haughty primeWhen first our pausing hearts begin
To love-" the olden- time;":

And, as we gaze, we sigh to think
How many a year hath passed
Since'neath those cold and faded trees
Our footsteps wandered last;
And old companions-now perchance
Estranged, forgot, or deadConme round us, as those autumn leaves
Are crushed beneath our tread.
We stand among the fallen leaves
In our own autumn dayAnd, tottering on with feeble steps,
Pursue our cheerless way.
We look not back-too long ago
Hath all we loved been lost;
Nor forward-for we may not live
To see our new hope crossed:
But on we go-the sun's faint beam

Fancy.-KEATs.
EvER let the fancy roam,
Pleasure never is at home;
At a touch sweet pleasure melteth,
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth;
Then let winged fancy wander
Through the thoughts still spread beyond her,
Open wide the mind's cage-door,
She'll dart forth, and cloudward soar.
O sweet Fancy! let her loose;
Summer's joys are spoilt by use,
And the enjoying of the spring
Fades as does its blossoming;
Autumn's red-lipped fruitage too,
Blushing through the mist and dew,
Cloys with tasting: what do then 8
Sit thee by the ingle, when
The sear fagot blazes bright,
Spirit of a winter's night;
When the soundless earth is muffled,
And the caked snow is shuffled
From the ploughboy's heavy shoon;
When the night doth meet the moon
In a dark conspiracy
To banish even from her sky.
362FANCY.
Sit thee there, and send abroad,
With a mind self-overawed,
Fancy, high-commissioned;-send her!
She has vassals to attend her;
She will bring, in spite of frost,
Beauties that the earth bath lost;
She will bring thee, altogether,
All delights of summer weather;
All the buds and bells of May,
From dewy sward or thorny spray;
All the heaped autumn's wealth,
With a still, mysterious stealth:
She will mix these pleasures up
Like three fit wines in a cup,
And thou shalt quaff it: thou shalt hear
Distant harvest-carols clear;
Rustle of the reaped corn;
Sweet birds antheming the morn:
And, in the same moment-hark I'Tis the early April lark,
Or the rooks, with busy caw,
Foraging for sticks and straw.
Thou shalt, at one glance, behold
The daisy and the marigold;
White-plumed lilies, and the first
Hedge-grown primrose that hath burst;
Shaded hyacinth, alway
Sapphire queen of the mid-May;
And every leaf and every flower
Pearled with the self-same shower.
Thou shalt see the field-mouse peep
Meager from its celled sleep;
And the snake all winter thin
Cast on sunny bank its skin;
Freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see
Hatching in the hawthorn tree,
When the hen-bird's wing doth rest
Quiet on her mossy nest;
Then the hurry and alarm
When the bee-hive casts its swarm;
Acorns ripe down-pattering,
While the autumn breezes sing.
Oh, sweet Fancy! let her loose;
Everything is spoilt by use:
At a touch sweet pleasure melteth
Like to bubbles when rain peltethEver let the Fancy roam,
Pleasure never is at home.

But hardier far, once more I see thee bend
Thy forehead, as if fearful to offend,
Like an unbidden guest. Though day by day,

The rising sun, and on the plains descend;
Yet art thou welcome, welcome as a friend

A  Rillfrom    the Town Pump.-HAWTHORNE.
NOON, by the north clock! Noon, by the east! High noon,
too, by these hot sunbeams, which fall, scarcely aslope, upon
my head, and almost make the water bubble and smoke, in the
trough under my nose. Truly, we public characters have a
tough time of it! And, among all the town officers, chosen at
March meeting, where is he that sustains, for a single year, the
burden of such manifold duties as are imposed, in perpetuity,
upon the Town Pump? The title of " town treasurer" is rightfully mine, as guardian of the best treasure that the town has.
The overseers of the poor ought to make me their chairman,
since I provide bountifully for the pauper, without expense
to him that pays taxes. I am at the head of the fire department, and one of the physicians to the board of health. As a
keeper of the peace, all water-drinkers will confess me equal to
the constable. I perform some of the duties of the town-clerk,
by promulgating public notic,s, when they are posted on my
front. To speak within bounds, I am the chief person of the
municipality, and exhibit, moreover, an admirable pattern to
my brother officers, by the cool, steady, upright, downright,
and impartial discharge of my business, and the constancy with
which I stand to my post. Summer or winter, nobody seeks
me in vain; for, all day long, I am seen at the busiest corner,
364A RILL FROM THE TOWN PUMP.
just above the market, stretching out my arms to rich and poor
alike; and at night I hold a lantern over my head, both to
show where I am, and keep people out of the gutters.
At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the parched populace, for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist.
Like a dramseller on the mall, at muster-day, I cry aloud to all
and sundry, in my plainest accents, and at the very tiptop of
my voice. Here it is, gentlemen! Here is the good liquor!
Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, walk up, walk up! Here is the
superior stuff! Here is the unadulterated ale of father Adam--
better than Cognac, Hollands, Jamaica, strong beer, or wine of
any price; here it is by the hogshead or the single glass, and
not a cent to pay! Walk up, gentlemen, walk up, and help
yourselves!
It were a pity, if all this outcry should draw no customers.
Here they come. A hot day, gentlemen! Quaff, and away
again, so as to keep yourselves in a nice cool sweat. You, my
friend, will need another cup-full, to wash the dust out of your
throat, if it be as thick there as it is on your cow-hide shoes. I
see that you have trudged half a score of miles to-day; and, like
a wise man, have passed by the taverns, and stopped at the running brooks and well-curbs. Otherwise, betwixt heat without
and fire within, you would have been burnt to a cinder, or
melted down to nothing at all, in the fashion of a jelly-fish. Drink,
and make room for that other fellow, who seeks my aid to quench
the fiery fever of last night's potations, which he drained from
no cup of mine. Welcome, most rubicund sir! You and I
have been great strangers, hitherto; nor, to confess the truth,
will my nose be anxious for a closer intimacy, till the fumes of
your breath be a little less potent. Mercy on you, man! the
water absolutely hisses down your red-hot gullet, and is converted quite to steam, in the miniature tophet, which you mistake for a stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the word of an
honest toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any kind of a
dram-shop, spend the price of your children's food, for a swig
half so delicious? ]Now, for the first time these ten years, you
know the flavor of cold water. Good-by; and, whenever you
are thirsty, remember that I keep a constant supply, at the old
stand. Who next? Oh, my little friend, you are let loose
from school, and come hither to scrub your blooming face, and
drown the memory of certain taps of the ferule, and other
school-boy troubles, in a draught from the Town Pump. Take
it, pure as the current of your young life. Take it, and may
your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst

than now! There, my dear child, put down the cup, and yie I
your place to this elderly gentleman, who treads so tenderly
over the paving-stones, that I suspect he is afraid of breaking
them. What! he limps by, without so much as thanking me,
as if my hospitable offers were meant only for people who have
no wine-cellars. Well, well, sir-no harm done, I hope! Go,
draw the cork, tip the decanter; but, when your great toe shall
set you a-roaring, it will be no affair of mine. If gentlemen
love the pleasant titillation of the gout, it is all one to the Town
Pump. This thirsty dog, with his red tongue lolling out, does
not scorn my hospitality, but stands on his hind legs, and laps
eagerly out of the trough. See how lightly he capers away
again! Jowler, did your worship ever have the gout?
Are you all satisfied! Then wipe your mouths, my good
friends; and, while my spout has a moment's leisure, I will delight the town with a few historical reminiscences. In far antiquity, beneath a darksome shadow of venerable boughs, a
spring bubbled out of the leaf-strown earth, in the very spot
where you now behold me, on the sunny pavement. The water
was as bright and clear, and deemed as precious, as liquid diamonds. The Indian sagamores drank of it, from time immemorial, till the fatal deluge of the fire-water burst upon the red
men, and swept their whole race away from the cold fountains.
Endicott, and his followers, came next, and often knelt down to
drink, dipping their long beards in the spring. The richest
goblet, then, was of birch bark. Governor Winthrop, after a
journey afoot from Boston, drank here, out of the hollow of his
hand. The elder Higginson here wet his palm, and laid it on
the brow of the first town-born child. For many years it was
the watering-place, and, as it were, the wash-bowl of the vicinity-whither all decent folks resorted, to purify their visages,
and gaze at them afterwards-at least the pretty maidens didin the mirror which it made. On Sabbath-days, whenever a
babe was to be baptized, the sexton filled his basin here, and
placed it on the communion-table of the humble meeting-house,
which partly covered the site of yonder stately brick one.
Thus, one generation after another was consecrated to Heaven
by its waters, and cast their waxing and waning shadows into
its glassy bosom, and vanished from the earth, as if mortal life
were but a flitting image in a fountain. Finally, the fountain
vanished also. Cellars were dug on all sides, and cart-loads of
gravel flung upon its source, whence oozed a turbid stream,
forming a mud-puddle at the corner of two streets. In the hot
months, when its refreshment was most needed, the dust flew
366A RILL FROM THE TOWN PUMP.
in clouds over the forgotten birthplace of the waters, now their
grave. But, in the course of time, a Town Pump was sunk
into the source of the ancient spring; and when the first decayed, another took its place-and then another, and still another
-till here stand I, gentlemen and ladies, to serve you with my
iron goblet. Drink, and be refreshed! The water is pure and
cold as that which slaked the thirst of the red sagamore, beneath the aged boughs, though now the gem of the wilderness
is treasured under these hot stones, where no shadow falls, but
from the brick buildings. And be it the moral of my story,
that, as this wasted and long-lost fountain is now known and
prized again, so shall the virtues of cold water, too little valued
since your fathers' days, be recognized by all.
Your pardon, good people! I must interrupt my stream of
eloquence, and spout forth a stream of water, to replenish the
trough for this teamster and his two yoke of oxen, who have
come from Topsfield, or somewhere along that way. No part
of my business is pleasanter than the watering of cattle. Look!
how rapidly they lower the water-mark on the sides of the
trough, till their capacious stomachs are moistened with a gallon or two apiece, and they can afford time to breathe it in,
with sighs of calm enjoyment. Now they roll their quiet eyes
around the brim of their monstrous drinking-vessels. An ox is
your true toper.
But I perceive, my dear auditors, that you are impatient for
the remainder of my discourse. Impute it, I beseech you, to no
defect of modesty, if I insist a little longer on so fruitful a topic
as my own multifarious merits. It is altogether for your good.
The better you think of me, the better men and women will you
find yourselves. I shall say nothing of my all-important aid on
washing days; though, on that account alone, I might call myself the household god of a hundred families. Far be it from

faces, which you would present, without my pains to keep you
clean. Nor will I remind you how often, when the midnight
bells make you tremble for your combustible town, you have
fled to the Town Pump, and found me always at my post, firm,
amid the confusion, and ready to drain my vital current in your
behalf. Neither is it worth while to lay much stress on my
claims to a medical diploma, as the physician, whose simple rule
of practice is preferable to all the nauseous lore which has found
men sick or left them so, since the days of Hippocrates. Let us
take a broader view of my beneficial influence on mankind.

The Blind Preacher.-WIRT.
IT wvas one Sunday, as I travelled through the county of
Orange, that my eye was caught by a cluster of horses tied
near a ruinous old, wooden house in the forest, not far from
the roadside.  Having frequently seen such objects before, in
travelling through these States, I had no difficulty in understanding that this was a place of religious worship.
Devotion alone should have stopped me, to join in the duties
of the congregation; but I naust confess, that cuiiosity to hear
the preacher of such a wilderness, was not the least of my motives.  On entering, I was struck with his preternatural appearance. He was a tall and very spare old man; his head, which
was covered with a white linen cap, his shrivelled hands, and
his vbice, were all shaking under the influence of a palsy; and
a few moments ascertained to me that he was perfectly blind.
The first emotions that touched my breast were those of
mingled pity and veneration. But how soon were all Tny feelings changed! The lips of Plato were never more worthy of a
prognostic swarm of bees, than were the lips of this holy man!
It was a day of the administration of the sacrament; and his
subject was, of course, the passion of our Saviour. I had heard
the subject handled a thousand times; I had thought it exhausted long ago. Little did I suppose that in the wild woods
of America, I was to meet with a man whose eloquence would
give to this topic a new and more sublime pathos than I hlad
ever before witnessed.
As he descended from the pulpit to distribute the mystic
symbols, there was a peculiar, a more than human solemnity in
his air and manner, which made my blood run cold, and my
whole frame shiver.
He then drew a picture of the sufferings of our Saviour; his

men concede to me-if not in my single self, yet as the representative of a class-of being the grand reformer of the age.
From my spout, and such spouts as mine, must flow the stream,
that shall cleanse our earth of the vast portion of its crime and
anguish, which has gushed from the fiery fountains of the still.
In this mighty enterprise, the cow shall be my great confederate. Milk and water! The TOWN PuMP and the Cow!
Such is the glorious copartnership, that shall tear down the distilleries and brew houses, uproot the vineyards, shatter the ciderpresses, ruin the tea and coffee trade, and finally monopolize
the whole business of quenching thirst. Blessed consummation!
Then, Poverty shall pass away from the land, finding no hovel
so wretched, where her squalid form may shelter itself. Then
Disease, for lack of other victims, shall gnaw its own heart, and
die. Then Sin, if she do not die, shall lose half her strength.
Until now, the phrensy of hereditary fever has raged in the human blood, transmitted from sire to son, and rekindled, in every
generation, by fresh draughts of liquid flame. When that
inward fire slhall be extinguished, the heat of passion cannot but
grow cool, and war-the drunkenness of nations-perhaps will
cease. At least, there will be no war of households. The husband and wife, drinking deep of peaceful joy-a calm bliss of
temperate affections-shall pass hand in hand through life, and
lie down, not reluctantly, at its protracted close. To them, the
past will be no turmoil of mad dreams, nor the future an eternity of such moments as follow the delirium of the drunkard.
Their dead faces shall express what their spirits were, and are
to be, by a lingering smile of memory and hope.
Ahem! Dry work, this speechifying; especially to an unpractised orator. I never conceived, till now, what toil the
temperance lecturers undergo for my sake. Hereafter, they
shall have the business to themselves. Do, some kind Christian, pump a stroke or two, just to whet my whistle. Thank
iyou, sir! My dear hearers, when the world shall have been
regenerated, by my instrumentality, you will collect your useless
vats and liquor casks into one great pile, and make a bonfire, in
honor of the Town Pump. And, when I shall have decayed,
like my predecessors, then, if you revere my memory, let a marble fountain, richly sculptured, take my place upon the spot.
Such monuments should be erected everywhere, and inscribed
with the names of the distinguished champions of my cause.
Now listen; for something very important is to come next.
There are two or three honest friends of mine-and true
friends, I know, they are-who, nevertheless, by their fiery pug368RIENZI'S ADDRESS TO THE ROMANS.
nacity in my behalf, do put me in fearful hazard of a broken
nose, or even a total overthrow upon the pavement, and the loss
of the treasure which I guard. I pray you, gentlemen, let this
fault be amended. Is it decent, think you, to get tipsy with
zeal for temperance, and take up the honorable cause of the
Town Pump, in the style of a toper, fighting for his brandy bottle? Or, can the excellent qualities of cold water be no otherwise exemplified, than by plunging, slapdash into hot water, and
wofully scalding yourselves and other people? Trust me, they
may. In the moral warfare, which you are to wage-and, indeed, in the whole conduct of your lives-you cannot choose a
better example than myself, who have never permitted the dust
and sultry atmosphere, the turbulence and manifold disquietudes
of the world around me, to reach that deep, calm well of purity,
which may be called my soul. And whenever I pour out that
soul, it is to cool earth's fever, or cleanse its stains.
One o'clock! Nay, then, if the dinner-bell begins to speak, I

did of old. Hold out your vessel, my dear! There it is, full

the pitcher, as you go; and forget not, in a glass of my own
liquor, to drink-" SuccEss TO THE TOWN PUMP!"

The Protective Policy.-H. CLAY.
WHo that has a heart, or the sympathies of a man, can say
or feel that our hatters, tailors, and shoemakers, should not be
protected against the rival productions of other countries?- Who
would say that the shoemaker, who makes the shoes of his
wife-his own wife, according to the proverb, being the last
woman in the parish that is supplied with hers--shall not be
protected? that the tailor, who furnishes him with a new coat,
or the hatter, that makes him a new hat, to go to church, to attend a wedding or christening, or to visit his neighbor, shall not
be adequately protected?
Then there is the essential article of iron-that is a great central interest. Whether it will require a higher degree of protection than it will derive from such a system as I have sketched, I have not sufficient information to decide; but this I am
prepared to say, that question will be with the representatives
373THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
of those states which are chiefly interested; and, if their iron is
not sufficiently protected, they must take the matter up and
make out their case to be an exception to the general arrangement. *    *   *
With me, from the first moment I conceived the idea of creating, at home, a protection for the production of whatever is
needed to supply the wants of man, down to this moment, it
has always been purely a question of expediency. I never could
comprehend the constitutional objection which to some gentlemen seems so extremely obvious. I could comprehend, to be
sure, what these gentlemen mean to argue, but I never had the
least belief in the constitutional objection which slept from 1788
(or, rather, which reverses the doctrine of 1780) till it suddenly
waked up in 1820. Then, for the first time since the existence
of the constitution, was the doctrine advanced that we could
not legitimately afford any protection to our own home industry
against foreign and adverse industry. I say, that with me it
always was a question of expediency only. If the nation does
not want protection, I certainly never would vote to force it
upon the nation; but viewing it as a question of expediency
wholly, I have not hesitated heretofore, on the broad and comprehensive ground of expediency, to give my assent to all suitable measures proposed with a view to that end.
I have persuaded myself that the system now brought forward will be met in a spirit of candor and of patriotism, and in
the hope that whatever may have been the differences in the
Senate in days past, we have now reached a period in which we
forget our prejudices, and agree to bury our transient animosities deep at the foot of the altar of our common country, and
come together as an assemblage of friends, and brothers, and
compatriots, met in common consultation to devise the best
mode of relieving the public distress. It is in this spirit that I
have brought forward my proposed plan; and I trust in God,
invoking as I humbly do the aid and blessing of his providence,
that the Senators, on all sides of the chamber, will lay aside all
party feelings, and more especially that habitual suspicion to
which we are all more or less prone, (and from which I profess
not to be exempted more than other men,) that impels us to reject, without examination, and to distrust whatever proceeds
from a quarter we have been in the habit of opposing. Let us
lay aside prejudice; let us look at the distresses of our country,
and these alone. I trust that in this spirit we shall examine
these resolutions, and decide upon them according to the dictates of our own consciences, and in a pure and patriotic regard
to the welfare of our country.
374MR. PICKWICK IN A DILEMMA,
Mr. Pickwick in a Dilemma.-DIcENxs.
MR. PICKWICK'S apartments in Goswell street, although on a
limited scale, were not only of a very neat and comfortable description, but peculiarly adapted for the residence of a man of
his genius and observation. His sitting-room was the first floor
front, his bed-room the second floor front; and thus, whether
lie were sitting at his desk in the parlor, or standing before the
dressing-glass in his dormitory, he had an equal opportunity of
contemplating human nature in all the numerous phases it exhibits, in that not more populous than popular thoroughfare. His
landlady, Mrs. Bardell-the relict and sole executrix of a deceased custom-house officer-was a comely woman of bustling
manners End agreeable appearance, with a natural genius for
cooking, improved by study and long practice into an exquisite
talent. There were no children, no servants, no fowls. The
only other inmates of the house were a large man and a small
boy; the first a lodger, the second a production of Mrs. Bardell's. The large man was always at home precisely at ten
o'clock at night, at which hour he regularly condensed himself
into the limits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlor; and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master
Bardell were exclusively confined to the neighboring pavements
and gutters. Cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the
house; and in it Mr. Pickwick's will was law.
To any one acquainted with these points of the domestic
economy of the establishment, and conversant with the admirable regulation of Mr. Pickwick's mind, his appearance and behavior on the morning previous to that which had been fixed
upon for the journey to Eatanswill, would have been most mysterious and unaccountable. He paced the room to and fro with
hurried steps, popped his head out of the window at intervals
of about three minutes each, constantly referred to his watch,
and exhibited many other manifestations of impatience, very unusual with him. It was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation, but what that something was, not
even Mrs. Bardell herself had been enabled to discover.
"Mrs. Bardell," said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable
female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the
apartment.
"Sir," said Mrs. Bardell.
"Your little boy is a very long time gone."
"Why, it's a good long way to the Borough, sir," remonstrated Mrs. Bardell.
375THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
"Ah," said Mr. Pickwick, "very true; so it is."
Mr. Pickwick relapsed into silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed
her dusting.
" Mrs. Bardell," said Mr. Pickwick, at the expiration of a few
minutes.
"Sir," said Mrs. Bardell again.
"Do you think it's a much greater expense to keep two people, than to keep one?"
"La, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, coloring up to the
very border of her cap, as she fancied she observed a species of
matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger; "La, Mr. Pickwick, what a question!"
"Well, but do you?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.
"That depends"-said Mrs. Bardell, approaching tl}e duster
very near to Mr. Pickwick's elbow, which was planted on the
table; "that depends a good deal upon the person, you know,
Mr. Pickwick; and whether it's a saving and careful person,
sir."
"That's very true," said Mr. Pickwick, "but the person I
have in my eye (here he looked very hard at Mrs. Bardell) I
think possesses these qualities; and has, moreover, a considerable knowledge of the world, and a great deal of sharpness, Mrs.
Bardell; which may be of material use to me."'" La, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell; the crimson rising to
her cap-border again.
"I do," said Mr. Pickwick, growing energetic, as was his
wont in speaking of a subject which interested him. "I do,
indeed; and to tell you the truth, Mrs. Bardell, I have made
up my mind."
"Dear me, sir," exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.
"You'll think it not very strange now," said the amiable Mr.
Pickwick, with a good-humored glance at his companion, "that
I never consulted you about this matter, and never mentioned
it, till I sent your little boy out this morning--eh?"
Mrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long
worshipped Mr. Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at
once, raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire. Mr. Pickwick was
going to propose-a deliberate plan, too-sent her little boy to
the Borough, to get him out of the way-how thoughtful-how
considerate!
c" Well," said Mr. Pickwick, " what do you think?"
-" Oh, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell. trembling with agitation, "you're very kind, sir."
376MR. PICKWISCK IN A DILEMMA.
"It'll save you a good deal of trouble, wont it?" said Mr.
Pickwick.
" Oh, I never thought anything of the trouble, sir," replied
Mrs. Bardell; "and, of course, I should take more trouble to
please you then than ever: but it is so kind of you, Mr. Pickwick, to have so much consideration for my loneliness."
"Ah, to be sure," said Mr. Pickwick; " I never thought of
that. When I am in town, you'll always have somebody to sit
with you. To be sure, so you will."
" I'm sure I ought to be a very happy woman," said Mrs.
Bardell.
"And your little boy"-said Mr. Pickwick.
"Bless his heart," interposed Mrs. Bardell, with a maternal sob.
"He, too, will have a companion," resumed Mr. Pickwick,
"a lively one, who'll teach him, I'll be bound, more tricks in a
week, than he would ever learn in a year." And Mr. Pickwick
smiled placidly.
" Oh you dear"-said Mrs. Bardell.
Mr. Pickwick started.
"Oh you kind, good, playful dear," said Mrs. Bardell; and
without more ado, she rose firom her chair, and flung her arms
round Mr. Pickwick's neck, with a cataract of tears, and a chorus of sobs.
" Bless my soul," cried the astonished Mr. Pickwick; "Mrs.
Bardell, my good woman-dear me, what a situation-pray
consider. Mrs. Bardell, don't-if any body should come""Oh, let them come," exclaimed Mrs. Bardell, frantically;
"I'll never leave you-dear, kind, good soul;" and, with these
words, Mrs. Bardell clung the tighter.
" Mercy upon me," said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently,
"I hear somebody coming up the stairs. Don't, don't, there's a
good creature, don't." But entreaty and remonstrance were
alike unavailing; for Mrs. Bardell had fainted in Mr. Pickwick's
arms; and before he could gain time to deposit her on a chair,
Master Bardell entered the room, ushering in Mr. Tupman, Mr.
Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass.
Mr. Pickwick was struck ntionless and speechless. He
stood with his lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the
countenances of his friends, without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation. They, in their turn, stared at him;
and Master Bardell, in his turn, stared at every body.
The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and
the perplexity of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they mightTHE BLIND PREACHER.
trial before Pilate; his ascent up Calvary; his crucifixion; and
his death. I knew the whole history; but never until then had
I heardc the circumstances so selected, so arranged, so colored!
It was all new; and I seemed to have heard it for the first
time in mv life. His enunciation was so deliberate that his
voice trembled on every syllable; and every heart in the assembly trembled in unison. His peculiar phrases had that force
o0 description, that the original scene appeared to be at that
moment acting before our eyes. We saw the very faces of the
Jews; the staring, frightful distortions of malice and rage. We
saw the buffet: my soul kindled with a flame of indignation;
and my hands were involuntarily and convulsively clinched.
But when he came to touch on the patience, the forgiving
meekness of our Saviour; when he drew, to the life, his blessed
eyes streaming in tears to heaven; his voice breathing to God
a soft and gentle prayer of pardon on his enemies, " Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do"-the voice of
the preacher, which had all along faltered, grew fainter and
fainter, until, his utterance being entirely obstructed by the
force of his feelings, he raised his handkerchief to his eyes, and
burst into a loud and irrepressible flood of grief. The effect is
inconceivable.  The whole house resounded with the mingled
groans, and sobs, and shrieks of the congregation.
It was some time before the tumult had subsided, so far as to
permit him to proceed. Indeed, judging by the usual, but fallacious standard of my own weakness, I began to be very uneasy for the situation of the preacher. For I could not'conceive how he would be able to let his audience down from the
height to which he had wound them, without impairing the solemnity and dignity of his subject, or perhaps shocking them
by the abruptness of the fall.  But--no; the descent was as
beautiful and sublime as the elevation had been rapid and enthusiastic.
The first sentence with which he broke the awful silence, was
a quotation from Rousseau: " Socrates died like a philosopher,
but Jesus Christ like a God!"
I despair of giving you any idea of the effect produced by
this short sentence, unless you could perfectly conceive the
whole manner of the man, as well as the peculiar crisis in the
discourse.  Never before did I completely understand what
Demosthenes meant by laying such stress on delivery. You
are to bring before you the venerable figure of the preacher;

have remained in exactly the same relative situations until the
suspended animation of the lady was restored, had it not been
for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit of
corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable
size, he at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain; but
by degrees the impression that his mother must have suffered
some personal damage pervaded his partially developed mind,
and considering Mr. Pickwick as the aggressor, he set up an appalling and semi-earthly kind of howling, and butting forward
with his head, commenced assailing that immortal gentleman
about the back and legs, with such blows and pinches as the
strength of his arm, and the violence of his excitement, allowed.
"Take this little villain away," said the agonized Mr. Pickwick; " he's mad."
"What is the matter?" said the three tongue-tied Pickwickians.
"I don't know," replied Mr. Pickwick, pettishly.  "Take
away the boy-(here Mr. Winkle carried the interesting boy,
screaming and struggling, to the farther end of the apartment.)
Now help me to lead this woman down stairs."
" Oh, I am better now," said Mrs. Bardell, faintly.
"Let me lead you down stairs," said the ever-gallant Mr.
Tupman.
"Thank you, sir-thank you," exclaimed Mrs. Bardell, hysterically. And down stairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.
"I cannot conceive" -said Mr. Pickwick, when his friend
returned-" I cannot conceive what has been the matter with
that woman. I had merely announced to her my intention of
keeping a man-servant, when she fell into the extraordinary
paroxysm in which you found her. Very extraordinary thing."
"Very," said his three friends.
"Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation," continued Mr. Pickwick.
"Very," was-the reply of his followers, as they coughed
slightly, and looked dubiously at each other.
This behavior was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarked.

"There is a man in the passage, now," said Mr. Tupman.
"It's the man that I spoke to you about," said Mr. Pickwick.
"I sent for him to the Borough this morning. Have the goodness to call him up, Snodgrass."
Mr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith presented himself.
378DRAMATIC DIALOGUES.
STUDENTS will find the practice of reading " Dramatic Dialogues" of
invaluable assistance in the acquirement of correct elocutionary expression.
The effort the mind involuntarily makes, in these exercises, to embody the various characters represented, induces a natural mode of delivery, no less essential to the public speaker, than it is to the private reader.
The vocal organs are also trained by this practice. Flexibility of
voice, variety of modulation, and rapid transition of tones, are all
developed and perfected by practising such examples.

Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
Bru. No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
But by reflection, by some other things.
Cas.'Tis just:
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors, as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
(Except immortal Caesar,) speaking of Brutus,
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.
Bru. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?
Cas. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;
And, since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous of me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths mly love
To every new protester; if you know
That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard
And after scandal them; or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
[Flourish and shout.
Bru. What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Choose Caesar for their king.
Cas. Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
Bru. I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well:
380THIE CONSPIRACY AGAINST C.ESAR.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye, and death i' the other,
And I will look on both indifferently:
For, let the gods so speed me, as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death.
Cas. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell, what you and other men
Think of this life: but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be, as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
We both have fed as well; and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he.
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me, Dar'st thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point? Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,
And bade him follow: so, indeed, he did.
The torrent roared: and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews; throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Ceesar cried, Help me, Cassius, or I sink.
I, as iEneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so, from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar: And this man
Is now become a god; and Cassius is
A wretched creature, and must bend his body,
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And, when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake:'tis true, this god did shake:
His coward lips did from their color fly;
And that same eye, whose bend doth awe the world,
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans
Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,
381THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Alas! it cried, Give me some drink, Titinius,
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world,
And bear the palm alone.
[Shout. Flourish.
Bru. Another general shout!
I do believe, that these applauses are
For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
Cas. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world,
Like a Colossus; and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some times are masters of their fates;
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we- are underlings.
Brutus, and Caesar: What should be in that Caesar?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure them,
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.  [Shout.
Now in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed:
Rorne, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,
That her wide walks encompassed but one man?
Now; is it Rome indeed, and room enough,
When there is in it but one only man.
O! you and I have heard our fathers say,
There was a Brutus once, that would have brooked
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,
As easily as a king.
Bru. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;I
What you would work me to, I have some aim;
How I have thought of this, and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Be any further moved. What you have said,
I will consider; what you have to say,
I will with patience hear: and find a time
382THE DEATH OF ION.
Both meet to hear, and answer, such high things,
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this;
Brutus had rather be a villager,
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.
Cas. I am glad, that my weak words
Have struck but this much show of fire from Brutus.
The Death of Ion.-TALFOUaD.
Trm Oracle at Delphi had announced that the vengeance which the
misrule of the race of Argos had brought on the people, in the form of a
pestilence, could only be disarmed by the extirpation of the guilty race,
and Ion, (son of Adrastus, late King of Argos,) on assuming the crown,
resolves to sacrifice himself to save his country. Ion is installed in his
royal dignity, attended by the High Priests, and Senators, &amp;c. The people
receive him with shouts.
ION -MEDON-AGENOR-CRYTHES-IRUS.
Ion. I thank you for your greetings-shout no more,
But in deep silence raise your hearts to heaven,
That it may strengthen one so young and frail
As I am for the business of this hour.
Must I sit here?
fMedon. My son! my son!
What ails thee? When thou shouldst reflect the joy
Of Argos, the strange paleness of the grave
Marbles thy face.
Ion. Am I indeed so pale!
It is a solem office I assume,
Which well may make me falter; yet sustained
By thee and by the gods I serve, I take it.
[Sits on the Throne.
Stand forth, Agenor.
Agenor. I await thy will.
Ion. To thee I look as to the wisest friend
Of this afflicted people; thou must leave
Awhile the quiet which thy life has earned
To rule our councils; fill the seats of justice
With good men, not so absolute in justice
383THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
As to forget what human frailty is;
And order my sad country.
Agenor. Pardon meIon. Nay, I will promise'tis my last request;
Grant me thy help till this distracted state
Rise tranquil from her griefs-'twill not be long,
If the great gods smile on us now. Remember,
Meanwhile, thou hast all power my word can give,
Whether I live or die.
Agenor. Die! Ere that hour,
May even the old man's epitaph be moss-grown!
Ion. Death is not jealous of the mild decay
That gently wins thee his; exulting youth
Provokes the ghastly monarch's sudden stride,
And makes his horrid fingers quick to clasp
His prey benumbed at noontide. Let me see
The captain of the guard.
Crythes. I kneel to crave
Humbly the favor which thy sire bestowed
On one who loved him well.
Ion. I cannot mark thee,
That wakest the memory of my father's weakness,
But I will not forget that thou hast shared
The light enjoyments of a noble spirit,
And learned the need of luxury. I grant
For thee and thy brave comrades ample share
Of such rich treasure as my stores contain,
To grace thy passage to some distant land,
Where, if an honest cause engage thy sword,
May glorious issues wait it. In our realm
We shall not need it longer.
Crythes. Dost intend
To banish the firm troops before whose valor
Barbarian millions shrink appalled, and leave
Our city naked to the first assault
Of reckless foes?
Ion. No, Crythes; in ourselves,
In our honest hearts and chainless hands
Will be our safeguard; while we do not use
Our power towards others, so that we should blush
To teach our children; while the simple love
Of justice and their country shall be born
With dawning reason; while their sinews grow
Hard'midst the gladness of heroic sports,
384THE DEATH OF ION.
We shall not need, to guard our walls in peace,
One selfish passion, or one venal sword.
I would not grieve thee; but thy valiant troopFor I esteem them valiant-must no more
With luxury which suits a desperate camp
Infect us. See that they embark, Agenor,
Ere night.?
Crythes. My lordIon. No more-my word hath passed.
Medon, there is no office I can add
To those thou hast grown old in; thou wilt guard
The shrine of Pheebus, and within thy homeThy too delightful home-befriend the stranger
As thou didst me; there sometimes waste a thought
On thy spoiled inmate.
Medon. Think of thee, my lord?
Long shall we triumph in thy glorious reign.
Ion. Prithee no more. Argives! I have a boon
To crave of you. Whene'er I shall rejoin
In death the father from whose heart in life
Stern fate divided me, think gently of him!
Think that beneath his panoply of pride
Were fair affections crushed by bitter wrongs
Which fretted him to madness; what he did,
Alas! ye know; could you know what he suffered,
Ye would not curse his name. Yet never more
Let the great interests of the state depend
Upon the thousand chances that may sway
A piece of human frailty; swear to me
That ye will seek hereafter in yourselves
The means of sovereignty; our country's space,
So happy in its smallness, so compact,
Needs not the magic of a single name
Which wider regions may require to draw
Their interest into one; but, circled thus,
Like a blest family, by simple laws
May tenderly be governed--all degrees,
Not placed in dextrous balance, not combined
By bonds of parchment, or by iron clasps,
But blended into one-a single form
Of nymph-like loveliness, which finest cords
Of sympathy pervading, shall endow
With vital beauty; tint with roseate bloom
In times of happy peace, and bid to flash
17
385THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
With one brave impulse, if ambitious bands
Of foreign power should threaten. Swear to me
That ye will do this!.Medon. Wherefore ask this now?
Thou shalt live long; the paleness of thy face,
Which late seemed death-like, is grown radiant now,
And thine eyes kindle with the prophecy
Of glorious years.
Ion. The gods approve me then!
Yet I will use the function of a king,
And claim obedience. Swear, that if I die
And leave no issue, ye will seek the power
To govern in the free-born people's choice,
And in the prudence of the wise..Medon and others. We swear it!
Ion. Hear and record the oath, immortal powers
Now give me leave a moment to approach
That altar unattended.
[He. goes to the altar.
Gracious gods!
In whose mild service my glad youth was spent,
Look on me now; and if there is a power,
As at this solemn time I feel there is,
Beyond ye, that hath breathed through all your shapes
The spirit of the beautiful that lives
In earth and heaven; to ye I offer up
This conscious being, full of life and love,
For my dear country's welfare. Let this blow
End all her sorrows!
[Stabs himself.
Enter IRUS.
Irus. I bring you glorious tidingsHa! no joy
Can enter here.
Ion. Yes-is it as I hope?
Irus. The pestilence abates.
Ion. [Springs to his feet.] Do ye not hear?
Why shout ye not? ye are strong-think not of me;
Hearken! the curse my ancestry had spread
O'er Argos is dispelled!
The offering is accepted--all is well!

886SCENE FROM THE HONEY-MOON.
Scene from   the Honey-moon.-ToBIN.
DUKE ARAINZA-COUNT MONTALBAN-ROLANDO.
Enter DUKE and MONTALBAN, followed by a servant, the Duis
speaking to servant.
This letter you will give my steward; this
To my old tenant, Lopez. Use dispatch, sir;
Your negligence may ruin an affair
Which I have much at heart.           [Exit servant.
Why how now, count!
You look but dull upon my wedding-day,
Nor show the least reflection of that joy
Which breaks from me, and should light up my friend.
Count. If I could set my features to my tongue,
I'd give your highness joy. Still, as a friend
Whose expectation lags behind his hopes,
I wish you happy,
Duke. You shall see me so.
Is not the lady I have chosen fair?
Count. Nay, she is beautiful.
Duke. Of a right age?
Count. In the fresh prime of youth, and bloom of womanhood.
Duke. A well-proportioned form and noble presence?
Count. True.
Duke. Then her wit? her wit is admirable!
Count. There is a passing shrillness in her voice.
)Duke. Has she not wit?
Count. A sharp-edged tongue, I own;
But uses it as bravoes do their swordsNot for defense, but mischief. Then, her gentleness,
You had almost forgot to speak of that.
Duke. Ay, there you touch me! yet, though she be prouder
Than the vexed ocean at its topmost swell,
And every breeze will chafe her to a storm,
I love her still the better. Some prefer
Smoothly o'er an unwrinkled sea to glide;
Others to ride the cloud-aspiring waves,
And hear, amid the rending tackle's roar,
The spirit of an equinoctial gale,
What though a patient and enduring loverLike a tame spaniel, that with crouching eye

the melancholy grandeur of their geniuses; you are to inmagine
that you hear his slow, solemn, well-accented enunciation, and
his voice of affecting, trembling melody; you are to remember
the pitch of passion and enthusiasm to which the congregation
were raised; and then the few moments of portentous, deathlike silence which reigned throughout the house; the preacher
removing his white handkerchief from his aged face, (even yet
wet from the recent torrent of his tears,) and slowly stretching
forth the palsied hand which holds it, begins the sentence,
"1Socrates died like a philosopher"-then, pausing, raising his
other hand, pressing them both, clasped together, with warmth
and energy, to his breast, lifting his 1" sightless balls" to heaven,
and pouring his whole soul into his tremulous voice-" but
Jesus Christ--like a God 1"  If he had been indeed and in truth
an angel of light, the effect could scarcely have been more divine.  Whatever I had been able to conceive of the sublimity
of Massillon, or the force of Bourdaloue, had fallen short of
the power which I felt from  the delivery of this simple sentence.
Immortality.-DANA.
Is this thy prison-house, thy grave, then, Love?
And doth death cancel tile great bond that holds
Commingling spirits? Arle thoughts that know no bounds,
But, self-inspired, rise upward, searching out
The Eternal Mind-the Father of all thoughtAre they become mere tenants of a tomb?Dwellers in darkness, who the illuminate realms
Of uncreated light have visited and lived?Lived in the dreadful splendor of that throne
Which One, with gentle hand the vail of flesh
Lifting, that hung'twixt man and it, revealed
In glory?-throne, before which, even novw,
Our souls, moved by prophetic power, bow down,
Rejoicing, yet at their own natures awed?Souls that Thee know by a mysterious sense.
Thou awful, unseen Presence-are they quenched,
Or burn they on, hid firom our mortal eyes
By that bright day which ends not; as the sun
His robe of light flings round the glittering stars?
And with our finames do perish all our loves?
Do those that took their root and put forth buds,
46THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Meets buffets and caresses-I have ta'en
With humble thanks her kindness and her scorn;
Yet when I am her husband, she shall feel
I was not born to be a woman's slave!
Can you be secret?
Count. You have found me so
In matters of some moment.
Duke. Listen, then:I have prepared a penance for her pride,
To which a cell and sackcloth, and the toils
Of a barefooted pilgrimage, were pastime.
As yet she knows me, as I truly am,
The Duke Aranza: in which character
I have fed high her proud and soaring fancy
With the description of my state and fortunes,
My princely mansions, my delicious gardens,
My carriages, my servants, and my pomp.
Now mark the contrast. In the very height
And fullest pride of her ambitious hopes,
I take her to a miserable hut,
All things are well digested for the purpose;
Where throwing off the title of a duke,
I will appear to her a low-born peasant.
There with coarse raiment, household drudgery,
Laborious exercise, and cooling viands,
I will so lower her distempered blood
And tame the devil in her, that, before
We have burnt out our happy honey-moon,
She, like a well-trained hawk, shall at my whistle
Quit her high flights, and perch upon my finger
To wait my bidding.
Count. Most excellent! a plot of rare invention!
Duke. When with a bold hand I have weeded out
The rank growth of her pride, she'll be a garden
Lovely in blossom, rich in fruit; till then,
An unpruned wilderness. But to your business,
How thrives your suit with her fair sister, count?
Count. The best advancement I can boast of in it
Is, that it goes not backward. She's a riddle,
Which he that solved the sphinx's would die guessing.
If I but mention love, she starts away,
And wards the subject off with so much skill,
That whether she be hurt or tickled most
Her looks leave doubtful. Yet I fondly think
388SCENE FROM THE HONEY-MOON.
She keeps me, as the plover from her nest
Fearful misleads the traveller, from the point
Where live her warmest wishes, that are breathed
For me in secret.
Duke. You've her father's voice?
Count. Yes; and we have concerted, that this evening,
Instead of friar Dominic, her confessor,
Who from his pious office is disabled
By sudden sickness, I should visit her;
And, as her mind's physician, feel the pulse
Of her affection.
Duke. May you quickly find
Her love to you the worst of her offenses,
For then her absolution would be certain.
Farewell! I see Rolando.
He is a common railer against women;
And on my wedding day I will hear none
Blaspheme the sex. Besides, as once he failed
In the same suit that I have thriven in,'Twill look like triumph.'Tis a grievous pity
He follows them with such a settled spleen,
For he has noble qualities.
Count. Most rare onesA happy wit and independent spirit.
Duke. And then he's brave too.
Count. Of as tried a courage
As ever walked up to the roaring th-roats
Of a deep-ranged artillery; and planted,'Midst fire and smoke, upon an enemy's wall,
The-standard of his country.
Duke. Farewell, count.
Count. Success attend your schemes!
Duke. Fortune crowns yours!                 [Extt.
COUNT and ROLANDO.
Count. Signior Rolando, you seem melancholy.
Rol. As an old cat in the mumps. I met three women,
I marvel much they suffer them to walk
Loose in the streets, whilst other untamed monsters
Are kept in cages-three loud-talking women!
They were discoursing of the newest fashions,
And their tongues went like-I have since been thinking
What most that active member of a woman
Of mortal things resembles.
389THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Count. Have you found it?
Rol. Umph! not exactly-something like a smoke-jack;
For it goes ever without winding up;
But that wears out in time-there fails the simile.
Next I bethought me of a water-mill;
But that stands still on Sundays. And, besides,
A mill, to give it motion, waits for grist;
Now, whether she has aught to say or no,
A woman's tongue will go for exercise.
In short, I came to this conclusion:
Most earthly things have their similitudes,
But woman's tongue is yet incomparable.
Was't not the duke that left you?
Count.'Twas.
Rol. He saw me,
And hurried off-a cur that has been caught
Privately stealing in a butcher's shop,
Ne'er sneaked away more scurvily. He knew
I should have rated him.
Count. Ay'twas most wise in him
To shun the bitter flowing of your gall.
You know he's on the brink of matrimony.
Rol. Why now, in reason what can he expect?
To marry such a woman!
A thing so closely packed with her own pride,
She has no room for any thought of him.
Why, she ne'er threw a word of kindness at him
But when she quarrelled with her monkey. Then,
As he with nightly minstrelsy doled out
A lying ballad to her peerless beauty,
Upon his whining lute, and at each turn
Sighed like a paviour, the kind lady, sir,
Would lift the casement up to laugh at him,
And vanish like a shooting star; whilst he,
Like an astronomer in an eclipse,
Stood gazing on the spot whence he departed:
Then, stealing home, went supperless to bed,
And fed all night upon her apparition.
Now, rather than espouse a thing like this,
I'd wed a bear that never learned to dance,
Though her first hug were mortal.
Count. Peace, Rolando!
You rail at women as priests cry down pleasure;
Who, for the penance which they do their tongues,
390SCENE FROM THE HONEY-MOON.
Give ample license to their appetites.
Come, come; however you may mask your nature,
I know the secret pulses of your heart
Beat towards them still. A woman-hater! pshaw!
A young and handsome fellow, and a brave oneRol. Go on.
Count. Had I a sister, mother, nay, my grandam,
I'd no more trust her with thee,
Than cream within the whiskers of a cat.
Rol. Right! I should beat her. You are very right.
I have a sneaking kindness for the sex;
And could I meet a reasonable woman,
Fair without vanity, rich without pride,
Discreet, though witty; learned, yet very humble,
That has no ear for flattery, no tongue
For scandal; one who never reads romances;
Who loves to listen better than to talk,
And rather than be gadding would sit quiet;
Hates cards and cordials, goes ill drest to church;
I'd marry certainly. You shall find two such,
And we'll both wed together.
Count. You are merry.
When shall we dine together?
Rol. Not to-day.
Count. Nay, I insist.
Rol. Where shall I meet you then?
Count. Here at the Mermaid.
Rol. I don't like the sign;
A mermaid is half woman.
Count. Pshaw, Rolando!
You strain this humor beyond sense or measure.
Rol. Well, on condition that we're very private,
And that we drink no toast that's feminine,
I'll waste some time with you.
Count. Agreed.
Rol. Go on, then.
I will but give directions to my page,
And follow you.

Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale; and, with
A rising.sigh, he wisheth you in heaven.
Hot. And you in hell, as often as he hears
Owen Glendower spoke of.
Glend. I cannot blame him: at my nativity,
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
Of burning cressets; and at my birth,
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Shaked like a coward.
Hot. Why so it would have done
At the same season, if your mother's cat had
But kittened, though yourself had ne'er been born.
Glend. I say, the earth did shake when I was born.
Hot. And I say, the earth was not of my mind,
If you suppose, as fearing you it shook.
Glend. The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
E9ot. 0, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
And not in fear of your nativity.
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
In strange eruptions: oft the teeming earth
Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
Which, for enlargement striving,
Shakes the old beldame earth, and topples down
Steeples, and moss-grown towers. At your birth,
Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
In passion shook.
Glend, Cousin, of many men.
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
To tell you once again-that at my birth,
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes;
The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
These signs have marked me extraordinary;
And all the courses of my life do show,
I am not in the roll of common men.

But will they come, when you do call for them?

The devil.
Hot. And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil,
By telling truth; tell truth, and shame the devil.

And I'll be sworn, I have power to shame him hence.
O, while you live, tell truth, and shame the devil.

WILFORD--SIR EDWARD MORTIMER.
Wilf. I would Sir Edward were come! the dread of a fearful encounter is, often, as terrible as the encounter itself. Yet
my encounters with him of late, are. no trifles. Some few hours
back, in this very room, he held a loaded pistol within an inch
of my brains. Well, that was passion; he threw it from him
on the instant, and-eh! he's coming-no. The old wainscot
cracks, and frightens me out of my wits; and, I verily believe,
the great folio dropt on my head, just now, from the shelf, on
purpose to increase my terrors.
Enter Sir EDWARD MORTIMER at the door of the library, which
he locks after him.  Wilford turns routnd on hearing him
shut it.
Wilf. What's that?'tis he himself! mercy on me! he has
locked the door! what is going to become of me!
Mort. Wilford! is no one in the picture gallery?

None within hearing, if I were to bawl
Ever so loud.
Mort. Lock yonder door.

Wilf. What, sir? lock-  [Mortimer waves with his hand..]
I shall, sir.         [Going to the door, and locking it.]
His face has little anger in it, neither:'Tis rather marked with sorrow and distress.
Mort. Wilford approach me. What am I to say
For aiming at your life; do you not scorn me,
Despise me for it?
Wilf. I! oh, sir!.Mort. You must;
For I am singled from the herd of men,
A vile, heart-broken wretch!
Wilf. Indeed, indeed, sir.
You deeply wrong yourself. Your equal's love,
The poor man's prayer, the orphan's tear of gratitude,
All follow you: and I! I owe you all!
I am most bound to bless vou.
Mort. Mark me, Wilford:
I know the value of the orphan's tear;
The poor man's prayer; respect from the respected;
I feel to merit these, and to obtain them,
Is to taste here, below, that thrilling cordial
Which the remunerating angel draws
From the eternal fountain of delight,
To pour on blessed souls, that enter heaven.
I feel this: I! how must my nature, then,
Revolt at him who seeks to stain his hand
In human blood? and yet it seems, this day
I sought your life-oh! I have suffered madness!
None know my tortures; pangs! but I can end them;
End them as far as appertains to thee.
I have resolved it. Hell-born struggles tear me!
But I have pondered on't, and I must trust thee.

Your life a burthen and your death a fear!
Wilf. For mercy's sake, forbear! you terrify me!
Mort. Hope this may fall upon thee; swear thou hopest it
By every attribute which heaven, earth, hell,
Can lend, to bind and strengthen conjuration,
If thou betray'st me.
Wilf. Well I-                           [Hesitating.]
Mfort. No retreating!
Wilf. (after a pause)
I swear, by all the ties that bind a man,
Divine or human, never to divulge!
-Mort. Remember you have sought this secret: yes,
Extorted it. I have not thrust it on you.'Tis big with danger to you; and to me,
While I prepare to speak, torment unutterable.
Know, Wilford, that, damnation!
Wilf. Dearest sir!
Collect yourself. This shakes you horribly.
You had this trembling, it is scarce a week,
At Madam Helen's..Mort. There it is. Her uncleWilf. Her uncle!
Mort. Him. She knows it not; none know it;
You are the first ordained to hear me say,
I am-   his murderer.
Wilf. O, heaven!
Mort. His assassin.
Wilf. What you that-mur-the murder-I am choked!
Mort. Honor, thou blood-stained god! at whose red altar
Sit war and homicide, 0, to what madness
Will insult drive thy votaries! by heaven!
In the world's range there does not breathe a man
Whose brutal nature I more strove to soothe,
With long forbearance, kindness, courtesy,
Than his who fell by me. But he disgraced me,
Stained me, oh, death and shame! the world looked on,
And saw this sinewy savage strike me down;
Rain blows upon me, drag me to and fro,
395THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
On the base earth, like carrion. Desperation,
In every fibre of my frame, cried vengeance!
I left the room, which he had quitted: chance,
Curse on the chance! while boiling with my wrongs,
Thrust me against him, darkling, in the street:
I stabbed him to the heart: and my oppressor
Rolled, lifeless, at my foot.
Wilf. Oh! mercy on me!
How could this deed be covered?
Mort. Would you think it?
E'en at the moment when I gave the blow,
Butchered a fellow-creature in the dark,
I had all good men's love. But my disgrace,
And my opponent's death, thus linked with it,
Demanded notice of the magistracy.
They summoned me, as friend would summon friend,
To acts of import, and communication.
We met: and'twas resolved, to stifle rumor,
To put me on my trial. No accuser,
No evidence appeared, to urge it on:'Twas meant to clear my fame. How clear it then?
How cover it? you say. Why, by a lie;
Guilt's offspring, and its guard. I taught this breast,
Which truth once made her throne, to forge a lie;
This tongue to utter it; rounded a tale,
Smooth as a seraph's song from Satan's mouth;
So well compacted, that the o'erthronged court
Disturbed cool justice in her judgment-seat,
By shouting "innocence!" ere I had finished.
The court enlarged me; and the giddy rabble
Bore me, in triumph, home. Ay! look upon me.
I know thy sight aches at me.
Wilf. Heaven forgive me!
I think I love you still: but I am young;
I know not what to say: it may be wrong;
Indeed I pity you.
Mort. I disdain all pity.
I ask no consolation. Idle boy!
Think'st thou that this compulsive confidence
Was given to move thy pity? love of fame,
For still I cling to it, has urged me thus,
To quash thy curious mischief in its birth.
Hurt honor, in an evil, cursed hour,
Drove me to murder; lying:'twould again.
396-SCENE FROM THE IRON CHEST
My honesty, sweet peace of mind, all, all
Are bartered for a name. I will maintain it.
Should slander whisper o'er my sepulchre,
And my soul's agency survive in death,
I could embody it with heaven's lightning,
And the hot shaft of my insulted spirit
Should strike the blaster of my memory
Dead, in the church-yard. Boy, I would not kill thee;
Thy rashness and discernment threatened danger;
To check them there was no way left but this,
Save one-your death: you shall not be my victim.
Wilf. My death! what, take my life? my life to prop
This empty honor.
iort. Empty? grovelling fool!
Wilf. I am your servant, sir; child of your bounty,
And know my obligation. I have been
Too curious haply;'tis the fault of youth.
I ne'er meant injury: if it would serve you,
I would lay down my life; I'd give it freely:
Could you, then, have the heart to-rob me of it?
You could not; should not.
Mort. How!
Wilf. You dare not.
_fMort. Dare not!
Wilf. Some hours ago you durst not. Passion moved you;
Reflection interposed, and held your arm.
But, should reflection prompt you to attempt it,
My innoceiice would give me strength to struggle,
And wrest the murderous weapon from your hand.
How would you look to find a peasant boy
Return the knife you levelled at his heart;
And ask you which in heaven would show the best,
A rich man's honor, or a poor man's honesty?
Mort.'Tis plain I dare not take your life. To spare it,
I have endangered mine. But dread my power;
You know not its extent. Be warned in time;
Trifle not with my feelings. Listen, sir!
Myriads of engines, which my secret working
Can rouse to action, now encircle you.
Your ruin hangs upon a.thread: provoke me,
And it shall fall upon you. Dare to make
The slightest movement to awa*ke my fears,
And the gaunt criminal, naked, and stake-tied,
Left on the heath to blister in the sun,

GREAT actions and strikinlg occurrences, having excited a temporary admiration, often pass away and are forgotten, because
they leave no lasting results, affecting the prosperity of communities.  Such is frequently the fortune of the most brilliant military achievements.   Of the ten thousand battles which have

But let me quit your service.

Scene from Old Heads and Young Hearts.
BORCICAULT.
LITTLETON COKE-LORD ROEBUCK--BOB.
Lit. Charles, my dear fellow.       [Shaking his hand.
Roe. The same as ever-I can almost believe myself at college again-and Bob, tooBob. Yes, my lord, promoted from gyp to lawyer's clerk.
Roe. It seems but a month ago since I roasted you for courting my bed-maker--do you remember?
Bob. Remember! your lordship tied me along a form before
the fire, went out, and forgot me.
Roe. You found that night's roasting a cure for love, eh?
Well, I'll remember you this time: there is a plaster for your
[Gives him a note,] sore memory-vanish!
Bob. Never mind, you may want me again if you like.
[Looks at money-exit.
Lit. Why, your long residence in Paris has transmuted you
from a model for young England, into the type of jeune France.
Some time since we parted at Alma Mater.
Roe. Three years; I started immediately for Paris, where my
brother was ambassador plenipotentiary; my father wished me
to graduate in diplomacy under his able sturveillance.
398SCENE FROM OLD HEADS AND YOUNG HEARTS. 399
Lit. And your respected sire, the Home Secretary?
Roe. I have not seen the Earl since my return.
Lit. How?
Roe. No! To be candid with you, I'm in a scrape, so I naturally hastened to you.
Lit. I have at your service a stock of advice, generously
subscribed by my friends when I revealed to them the bottom
of my purse-proceed.
Roe. The most ancient of maladies.
Lit. Oh, love?
Roe. To distraction.
Lit, How? vulgarly, with a woman-or fashionably, with
yourself?
Roe. Listen and judge. Ten days ago, as in obedience to my
father's mandate, I was on my route from Paris-my chariot
was arrested on the Dover Road, by a spill, illustrated with
oaths and screams.
Lit. Heroics-by Jove!
Roe. Post-boy whipping--horses kicking-old gentleman
cursing-young lady screaming and fainting alternately.
Lit. Lucky dog!
Roe. I disengaged the senseless fair, threw off her bonnet,
and unveiled a face-oh, Coke, such a face! she gasped for
breath.
Lit. You lent her some of yours?
Roe. I did-but she relapsed again.
Lit. Naturally-so you kept her alive by repeated application?
Roe. Till her father came up.
Lit. She recovered, then?
Roe. Immediately-he thanked me, tucked my angel under
his arm, they re-entered the righted vehicle, and drove on.
Lit. Is that all?
Roe. Forbid it, Venus-no--with incredible trouble I traced
them. The father--the dragon who guards this Hesperian
fruit, is an old East Indian colonel, as proud as Lucifer, and as
hot as his dominions-I hovered round the house for a week.
Lit. Successfully?
Roe. I saw her once for a second at the back garden gate.
Lit. To speak to her?
Roe. I hadn't time.
Lit. No?-Oh!
Roe. No. So I gave her a kissLit. Excellent economy! and her name?THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Roe. Is Rocket-her father, an eccentric old bully, turns his
house into a barrack-mounts guard at the hall-door-the poor
girl can't move without a sentry, and I believe her lady's maid
is an old one-eyed corporal of artillery.
Lit. Is she rich?
Roe. She is fair.
Lit. Possibly-a thing to be admired in a danseuse or a
friend's wife; but in the matrimonial stocks, done on our Western'change, the fairest hue we recognize is yellow.
Roe. Does virtue go for nothing?
Lit. Oh! no! character is indispensable to servant maids,
but virtue, as a word, is obsolete; we have, indeed, a French
one like it, vertu-yes, ladies of vertu might signify articles of
rarity.
Roe. Does the lexicon of fashion, then, abjure the sense?
Lit. Certainly not; virtue signifies the strength in a bottle
of salts.
Roe. And vice?
Lit. A-a fault in horses.
Roe. And religion?
Lit. A pew in a fashionable church!
Roe. So'twould appear that beauty is invested in bankstock; grace consolidated with the landed interests; while reputation fluctuates with the three and a half per cents.
Lit. Exactly; gold is the Medean bath of youth, possessing
also a magnetic attraction for every cardinal virtue, while all the
plagues of Egypt are shut up in one English word, and that is
poverty; the exhibition of which, like that of the Gorgon's head,
turns the hearts of your dearest friends to stone.
Roe. Can May Fair legislation so repeal the laws of nature?
by Jove! the West end at last will cut the sun because it rises
in the east, and live by-wax light!
Lit. You, perhaps, may never see the world as I do, Charles,
because I am poor; but a rich man's view of life is bounded by
his parasites-he feels but through his glove, and thinks all
things are soft.
Roe. Then I am lost, for my angel is penniless.
Lit. Right, angels are the only things who can be poor and
lovely; but to marry thus; before -you have given the worshipful company of mamma brokers a chance, is against all
rule.
Roe. Would you have me marry a thing whose mind is
bounded by her bonnet, a soul perfumed with foreign sentiment
-as guiltless of old English virtues as her tongue is of their

native names. No! I'll have a heart that beats with blooda cheek that's red with it-and be no slave of such a thing
of scent and paint-but strike one blow for love and human
nature.
Lit. Oh, you luxurious dog! [Shaking his hand.] Oh--h!
if I could only afford to marry a woman instead of a banker's
account-but what obstacles oppose your epicurean intentions
towards Miss Rocket?
Roe. I hear my father intends for me the double honor of a
seat in the House, and a wife-my cousin Alice, the wealthy
young widow of Lord George Hawthorn.
Lit. Lady Alice-who shook the very apathy of the opera
last week, by demanding to be balloted into the omnibus box!
Roe. Such a wife-why do they not give her a commission
n the Blues, at once?
Lit. She flashed into our fashionable system like a new
comet, whose eccentricity defied all known law, and quickly
drew after her a train that obliterated all the constellations of
St. James's, and the heavenly bodies of May Fair.
Roe. You know her, then?
Lit. A Polka acquaintanceship! I've been introduced to her
waist; we know each other in the house of our mutual friends
-but of what use can I be here?
Roe. The greatest. My father has arranged my nomination
for Closeborough, I shall be obliged to advocate his political
principles in the House, to which party old Rocket is a virulent
opponent.
Lit. What's to be done?
Roe. Oppose my father-and thus-oblige me by opposing
my election, and I will answer for your success.
Lit. Ha! ha! help me to your borough-why, you rascal,
would you make the Home Secretary purchase in a talented
member for the opposition?
Roe. Consent?
Lit. With all my heart; I see but one obstacle-the qualification!
Roe. The three hundred a-year--that's true-stay-Coke,
at Eton, you were considered a fellow of great pluck.
Lit. You flatter.
Roe. You look tenacious of life.
Lit. Ha!
Roe. I'll make you a present-of the widow.
Lit. Lady Alice?THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Roe. If she have not, ere this, volunteered to Morocco or
Mlacao.
Lit. Charles, to oblige you I accept the borough-for your
sake I'll encounter the widow and the five thousand a-year.
Trial Scene from Merchant of Venice.
SHASPEARE.
The DUKE, Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, SOLANIO, SALARINO, GRATIANO, and Attendants, discovered.
Duke. [Seated.] What, is Antonio here?
Ant. Ready, so please your grace.
Duke. I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
Uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.
Ant. I have heard
Your grace hath taken great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury; and am armed
To suffer with a quietness of spirit,
The very tyranny and rage of his.
Duke. Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
Sol. He's ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
Enter SHYLOKR.
Duke. Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
To the last hour of act; and then'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mercy, and remorse, more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty:
And, where thou now exact'st the penalty,
(Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,)
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
402TRIAL. SCENE FROM MERCHANT OF VENICE.      403
But, touched with human. gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back;
Enough to press a royal merchant down,
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms, and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never trained
To offices of tender.courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
Shy. I have possessed your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn,
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter, and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh, than to receive
Three thousand ducats:-I'll not answer that:
But say, it is my humor: is it answered?
What if my house be troubled with a rat,
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned; what, are you answered yet?
Some men there are, love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad, if they behold a cat;
Now for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be rendered,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
So can I give no reason, nor will I not,
More than a lodged hate, and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
Bass. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy, cruelty.
Shy. I am not bound to please thee with my answer.
Bass. Do all men kill the things they do not love?
Shy. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
Bass. Every offense is not a hate at first.
Shy. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
Ant. I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach,
And bid the main. flood bate its usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf,
Why he hath made. the ewe bleat for the lamb;THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops, and to make no noise,
When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well-do anything most hard,
As seek to soften that (than which what's harder?)
His Jewish heart; therefore I do beseech you,
Make no more offers, use no further means,
But, with all brief and plain conveniency,
Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.
Bass. For thy three thousand ducats here are six,
Shy. If every ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them, I would have my bond.
)Duke. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
Shy. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses, and your dogs, and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them; shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs;
Why sweat they under their burdens? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours, let their palates
Be seasoned with such viands? you will answer,
The slaves are ours:-So do I answer you:
The pound of flesh which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought, is mine, and I will have it:
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice:
I stand for judgment:-answer: shall I have it?
Duke. Upon my power, I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.
Sala. My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
New come from Padua.
Duke. Bring us the letters: call the messenger.
[Exit Salanio.
Bass. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man? courage yet
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
Ant. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death; the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me;

You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,
Than to live still, and write mine e.pitaph..Enter SoLANIO with NERISSA, dressed like a Lawyer's clerk, and
goes to the Duke.
Duke. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
Ner. From both, my lord: Bellario greets your grace.
[Presents a letter.-Shylock kneels on one knee, and
whets his knife on the floor.]
Bass. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
Shy. To cut the forfeit from that bankrupt there.
Gra. Can no prayers pierce thee?
Shy. [Gets up.] No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
Gra. Oh, be thou damned, inexorable dog,
And for thy life let justice be accused.
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith,
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
Governed a wolf, who, hanged for human slaughter,
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
And, whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
Are wolfish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.
Shy. [Holding up the bond, and tapping it with the knife.]
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
Repair. thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law..Duke. This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court:Where is he?
Ner. He attendeth here hard by,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
Duke. With all my heart, some three or four of you,
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
[Exeunt Gratiano and Solanio.
Meantime, the Court shall hear Bellario's letter.
[Reads.] " Your grace shall understand that, at the receipt
of your letter, I am very sick: but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor

chant: we turned o'er many books together; he is furnished
with my opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, (the
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend,) comes with him,
at my importunity, to fill up your grace's request in my stead.
I beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him
lack a reverent estimation; for I never knew so young a body
with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance,
whose trial shall better publish his commendation."
You hear the learned Bellario, what he writes,
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
Enter PORTIA, dressed like a Doctor of Laws, SOLANIO, and
GRATIANO.
Give me your hand: Came you from old Bellario?
Por. I did, my lord.
Duke. You are welcome: take your place. [Portia sits.
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?
Por. I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
Duke. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
[They standforth&amp;
Por. Is your name Shylock?
Shy. Shylock is my name.
Por. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule, that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
[To Ant.] You stand within his danger, do you not?
Ant. Ay, so he says.
Por. Do you confess the bond?
Ant. I do.
Por. Then must the Jew be merciful.
Shy. On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
Por. The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven,
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blessed;
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes;'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the fear and dread of kings;
But mercy is above the sceptered sway,
40GTRIAL SCENE FROM MERCHANT OF VENICE.
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,.
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
When mercy seasons justice: therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider thisThat, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy;
And that same.prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy: I have spoke thus much,
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which, if thou follow this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence'gainst the merchant there.
Shy. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
Por. Is he not able to discharge the money?
Bass. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, thrice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be,bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth: And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
Por. It must not be.'There is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established;'Twill be recorded for a precedent;
And many an error, by the same example,
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
SAy. [In ecstasy.] A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a
Daniel!
Oh, wise young judge, how do I honor thee!
Por. I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
Shy. Here'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is. [Gives it.
Por. Shylock, there's thrice thy money offered thee.
Shy. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven!
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not for Venice.
Por. Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful;
Take thrice tby money; bid me tear the bond.

40-0ces have been retained;'for such have become stereotyped,
as it were, in the affections of the young.
Care has been taken to furnish striking illustrations of
every variety of elocutionary expression.  The examples
intended for ORATORICAL exercise, and POETICAL recitation,
are unusually rich, new and varied; and especial attention
has been paid to selections exclusively adapted for READING
LESSONS.
I have taken infinite pains to make the whole of the
selections conducive to the development of sound patriotism,.and a healthy, manly tone of feeling and sentiment. I
have likewise endeavored to furnish to the youthful student
a species of intellectual vocabulary, for the suggestion of
ideas on topics -of leading and general interest.
To a work so strictly practical in its design, it has been
considered proper to append an equally practical system of
elocution. For this purpose I have embodied, as clearly
as it could be done in writing, the principles which govern
my mode of elocutionary instruction.
I have sought to divest this art of much of its artificial
character, substituting a close analytical dissection of the
sense and construction of language as the basis of the study,
instead of adhering to arbitrary and mechanical rules,
retaining only so many of the latter as are absolutely
essential.
By this process of instruction, the pupil is simply aided
in following out the promptings of nature, by the exercise
and consequent development of the perceptive faculties; and

glory as bright and as durable as the stars, how few that con.
tinue long to interest mankind! The victory of yesterday is
reversed by the defeat of to-day; the star of military glory,
rising like a meteor, like a meteor has fallen; disgrace and
disaster hang on the heels of conquest and renown; victor
and vanquished presently pass away to oblivion, and the world
holds on its course, with the loss only of so many lives and so
much treasure.
But if this is frequently, or generally, the fortune of military
achievements, it is not always so. There are enterprises, military as well as civil, that sometimes check the current of events;
give a new turn to human affairs, and transmit their consequences through ages. We see their importance in their results, and call them great, because great things follow. There
have been battles which have fixed the fate of nations. These
come down to us in history with a solid and permanent influence, not created by a display of glittering armor, the rush of
adverse battalions, the sinking and rising of pennons, the flight,
the pursuit, and the victory; but by their effect in advancing
or retarding human knowledge, in overthrowing or establishing
despotism, in extending or destroying human happiness. When
the traveller pauses on the plains of Marathon, what are the
emotions which strongly agitate his breast? what is that glorious recollection that thrills through his frame, and suffuses his
eyes?  Nlot, I imagine, that Grecian skill and Grecian valor
were here most signally displayed; but that Greece herself
was saved. It is because to this spot, and to the event which
has rendered it immortal, he refers all the succeeding glories of
the republic. It is because, if that day had gone otherwise,
Greece had perished. It is because he perceives that her philosophers and orators, her poets and painters, her sculptors and
architects, her government and free institutions point backward
to Marathon, and that their future existence seems to been suspended on the contingency, whether the Persian or Grecian
banner should wave victorious in the beams of that day's setting sun. And as his imagination kindles at the retrospect, he
is transported back to the interestinig moment; he counts the
fearful odds of the contending hosts; his interest for the result
overwhelms him; he trembles as if it was still uncertain., and
seems to doubt whether he may consider Socrates and Plato,
Demosthenes, Sophocles, and Phidias, as secure, yet, to himself
and to the world.

It doth appear, you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment. By my soul, I swear,
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me. I stay here on my bond.
Ant. Most heartily I do beseech tile court
To give the judgment.
Por. Why, then, thus it is.
You must prepare your bosom for his knife;Shy. Oh, noble judge! Oh, excellent'young man I
Por. For the intent and purpose of the'law
Hath full relation to the penalty,
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
Shy.'Tis very true. Oh, wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
Por. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
Shy. Ay, his breast;
So says the bond;--Doth it not, noble judge?
Nearest his heart; those are the very words.
Por. It is so. Are there balance here, to weigh
The flesh?
Shy. I have them ready.
Por. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
Shy. Is it so nominated in the bond?
Por. It is not so expressed; but what of that?'Twere good you do so much for charity.
Shy. I cannot find it:'tis not in the bond.
Por. Come, merchant, have you anything to say?
Ant. But little: I am armed, and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom; it is still her use,
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow,
An age of poverty: from which lingering penance
Of such a misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honorable wife;
Tell her the process of Antonio's end,
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her-be judge,
408TRIAL SCENE FROM MERCHANT OF VENICE.        4qI1
Whethler Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
Bass. Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteemed above thy life:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.
Gra. I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love;
I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some po*er to change this currish Jew.
Shy. These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter;
Would any of the stock of Barabbas
Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!  [Aside.
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
Por. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine;
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
Shy. Most rightful judge!
Por. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
Shy. Most learned judge! A sentence! come, prepare.
Por. Tarry a little: there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood:
The words expressly are, a pound of flesh;
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting of it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
Unto the State of Venice.
Gra. Oh, upright judge! Mark, Jew; a learned judge!
Shy. Is that the law?
Por. Thyself shalt see the act:
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
Gra. Oh, learned judge! Mark, Jew; a learned judge!
Shy. I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice,
And let the Christian go.
Bass. Here is the money.
Por. Soft:
The Jew shall have all justice! soft! no haste;
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
18THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Gra. Oh, Jew! an upright judge, a learned judgt
Por. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood; nor cut thou less, nor more,
But just a pound of flesh; if thou tak'st more
Or less than a just pound-be it but so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple! nay, if the scale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair,
Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.
Gra. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now,- infidel, I have thee on the hip.
Por. Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
Shy. Give me my principal, and let nfe go.
Bass. I have it ready for thee: here it is.
Por. He hath refused it in the open court;
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
Gra. A Daniel, still say I! a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
Shy. Shall I not barely have my principal?
Por. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
Shy. Why, then, the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.                 [Going
Por. Tarry, Jew;
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien,
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party'gainst the which he doth contrive,
Shall seize on half his goods: the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the State;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the Duke only, against all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou standest;
For it appears by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly, and directly too,
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurred
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
Gra. Beg that thou may'st have leave to hang thyself:
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the State,
410TRIAL SCENE FROM MERCHANT OF VENICE.        411
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Therefore, thou must be hanged at the State's charge.
Duke. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general State,
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
Por. Ay, for the State; not for Antonio.
Shy. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that:
You take my house, when you do take the prop
That doth sustain the house: you take my life,
When you do take the means whereby I live.
Por. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
Gra. A halter gratis; nothing else, for Heaven's sake.
Ant. So please my lord the Duke, and all the court,
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
I am content, so he will let me have
The other half in use--to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter:
Two things provided more-that, frw this favor,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possessed,
Unto his son Lorenzo, and his daughter.
Duke. He shall do this; or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here.
Por. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
Shy. I am content.
Por. Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
Shy. I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
I am not well; send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.
Duke. Get thee gone, but do it.
Gra. In christening thou shalt have two godfathers;
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.  [Exit Shy.
Duke. [To Por.] Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
Por. I humbly do desire your grace of pardon;
I must away this night toward Padua,
And it is meet I presently set forth.
Duke. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.

Enter CHARLES.
Chas. What noise is in this house! my head is broken
With several noises; and in every corner,
As if the earth were shaken with some strange colic,
There are stirs and motions. What planet rules this house?
Enter ANDREW.
Who's there?
And.'Tis I, sir, faithful Andrew.
Chas. Come near,
And lay thine ear down; hear'st no noise?
And. The cooks
Are chopping herbs and mince-meat to make pies,
And breaking marrow-bonesChas. Can they set them again?
And. Yes, yes, in broths and puddings, and they grow
stronger
For th' use of any man.
Chas. What squeaking's that?
Sure there is a massacre.
And. Of pigs and geese, sir,
And turkeys for the spit. The cooks are angry, sir,
And that makes up the medley.
Chas. Do they thus
At every dinner? I ne'er marked them yet,
Nor know who is a cook.
And. They're sometimes sober,
And then they beat as gently as a tabor.
Chas. What loads are these?
And. Meat, meat, sir, for the kitchen,
And stinking fowls the tenants have sent inThey'll ne'er be found out at a general eatingAnd there's fat venison, sir.
Chas. What's that?
And. Why, deer,
Those that men fatten for their private pleasures,
And let their tenants starve upon the commons.
Chas. I've read of deer, but yet I ne'er eat any.
And. There's a fishlnonger's boy with caviare, sir,
Anchovies and potargo, to make ye drink.
412SCENE FROM THE ELDER BROTHER.
C'has. Sure these are modern, very modern meats,
For I understand'em not.
And. No more does any man;
Till they be greased with oil, and rubbed with onions,
And then flung out of doors, they are rare salads.
Chas. And why is all this, prithee tell me, Andrew?
Are there any princes to dine here to-day?
By this abundance, sure there should be princes;
I've read of entertainment for the gods
At half this charge: will not six dishes serve'em?
I never had but one, and that a small one.
And. Your brother's married-this day, he's married,
Your younger brother, Eustace.
Chas. What of that?
And. And all the friends about are bidden hither!
There's not a dog that knows the house but comes too.
Chas. Married! to whom?
And. Why, to a dainty gentlewoman,
Young, sweet and modest.
Chas. Are there modest women?
How do they look?
And. Oh, you'd bless yourself to see them.
He parts with his books, he ne'er did so before yet.
Chas. What does my father for him?
And. Gives all his land,
And makes your brother heir.

And. Yes, you must study still, and he'll maintain you.
Chas. I am his eldest brother.
And. True, you were so;
But he. has leaped over your shoulders, sir.

He'll not inherit my understanding, too?
And. I think not; he'll scarce find tenants to let it
Out to.

And. The coach that brings the fairlady.
Now you may see her.
Chas. Sure this should be modest;
But I do not truly know what women make of it,

The story of the heavens looks very like her.

Wer. Why, thenBut we will talk of that anon. Remember,
I must be known here but as Werner. Come!
Come to my arms again!
Sure'tis no father's fondness dazzles me;
But had I seen that form amid ten thousand
Youth of the choicest, my heart would have chosen
This for my son!
Are you aware my father is no more.?
Ulric. Oh, heavens! I left him in a green old age..'Twas scarce three months since.
Wer. Have you not heard of Stralenheim 9
Ulric. I saved
His life but yesterday: he's here.
Wer. You saved
The serpent who will sting us all.!
Ulric. You speak
Riddles; what is this Stralenheim to us?
Wer. Everything. One who claims our father's lands:
Our distant kinsman, and our nearest foe.
Elric. I never heard his name till now-and what then I
His right must yield to ours.
Wer. Ay, if at Prague:
But here he is all powerful; and has spread
Snares for thy father.
Ulric. Doth he personally know you?
414SCENE FROM WERNER.
Wer. No; but he guesses shrewdly at my person,
As he betrayed last night: and I, perhaps,
But owe my temporary liberty
To his uncertainty.
Ulric. I think you wrong him,
(Excuse me for the phrase;) but Stralenheim
Is not what you prejudge him, or, if so,
He owes me something both for past and present;
I saved his life, he therefore trusts in me;
He hath been plundered too, since he came hither;
Is sick; a stranger; and as such not now
Able to trace the villain who hath robbed him:
I have pledged myself to do so; and the business
Which brought me here was chiefly that; but I
Have found, in searching for another's dross,
Iy own whole treasure-you, my parents!
Wer. [Agitatedly.] Who taught you thus to brand an unknown being
With the name of villain?
Ulric. My own feelings
Taught me to name a ruffian from his deeds.
Wer. Who taught you, long sought and ill-found boy, that
It would be safe for my own son to insult me?
Ulrric. I named a villain. What is there in common
With such a being and my father?
Wer. Everything!
That ruffian is thy father!
Ulric. [Starts, looks earnestly at Werner, and then says slowly]
And you avow it?
TWer. Ulric, before you dare despise your father,
Learn to divine and judge his actions. Young,
Rash, new to life, and reared in luxury's lap,
Is it for you to measure passion's force,
Or misery's temptation?  Wait-(not long,
It cometh like the night, and quickly)-Wait!Wait till, like me, your hopes are blighted-till
Sorrow and shame are handmaids of your cabin;
Famine and poverty your guests at table;
Despair your bed-fellow-then rise, but not
From sleep, and judge! Should that day e'er arrive-~
Should you see then the serpent who hath coiled
Himself around all that is dear and noble
Of you and yours, lie slumbering in your path,
With but his folds between your steps and happiness,

Inviting death by looking like it, while
His death alone can save you:--Thank your God!
If, then, like me, content with petty plunder,
You turn aside--I did so.                 [Drops into chair.

He's mean, deceitful, avaricious. You
Deem yourself safe, as young and brave; but learn
None are secure from desperation, few
From subtlety. He was within my powerI'm now in his:-are you not so?
Who tells you that he knows you not? Who says
He hath not lured you here to end you? or
To plunge you, with your parents, in a dungeon?  [Pauses.
Ulric. Proceed-proceed!
Wer. Me he hath ever known,
And hunted through each change of time-name-fortune--
And why not you? Are you more versed in men?
He wound snares round me; flung along my path
Reptiles, whom, in my youth, I would have spurned
Even from my presence; but, in spurning now,
Fill only with fresh venom. Will you be
More patient? Poverty-insult-chainsMy birthright seized-while my despairing
Wife-could you endure all this?

Made venial by the occasion, and temptations
Which nature cannot master or forbear.

Sir Rob. I tell you what, Humphrey Dobbins, there isn't a
syllable of sense in all you have been saying. But I suppose
you will maintain that there is?
Hum. Yes.
Sir Rob. Yes! Is that the way you talk to me, you old
boar? What's myv name?
Hum. Robert Bramble.
Sir Rob. A'nt I a baronet? Sir Robert Bramble of Blackbury
Hall, in the county of Kent?'Tis time you should know it,
for you have been my clumsy, two-fisted valet de chambre these
thirty years; can you deny that?
Hum. Umph!
Sir Rob. Umph! What the deuce do you mean by umph?
Open that rusty door of your mouth, and make your ugly voice
walk out of it. Why don't you answer my question?
Hum. Because, if I contradict you there, I should tell a lie,
and whenever I agree with you, you are sure to fall out.
Sir Rob. Humphrey Dobbins, I have been so long endeavoring to beat a few brains into your pate, that all your hair has
tumbled off it before I carry my point.
Hum. What then?   Our parson says my head is an emblem
of both our honors.
Sir Rob. Aye; because honors, like your head, are apt to
be empty.
Hum. No; but if a servant has grown bald under his master's nose, it looks as if there was honesty on one side, and regard for it on t'other.
Sir Rob. Why, to be sure, old Humphrey, you are as honest
as a-pshaw! the parson means to palaver us; but to return to
my position, I tell you I don't like your flat contradiction.
Hum. Yes, you do.
Sir Rob. I tell you I don't; I only love to hear men's arguments, I hate their flummery.
Hum. What do you call flummery?
Sir Rob. Flattery, blockhead! a dish too often served up,
by paltry poor men, to paltry rich ones.
Hum. I never serve it up to you.
18*PUBLIC VIRTUE.
Public Virtue.-H. CLAY.
I ROSE not to say one word which should wound the feelings
of President Tyler. The senator says that, if placed in like
circumstances, I would have been the last man to avoid putting
a direct veto upon the Bill, had it met my disapprobation; and
he does me the honor to attribute to me high qualities of stern
and unbending intrepidity. I hope, that in all that relates to
personal firmness, all that concerns a just appreciation of the
insignificance of human life-whatever may be attempted to
threaten or alarm a soul not easily swayed by opposition, or
awed or intimidated by menace-a stout heart and a steady
eye, that can survey, unmoved and undaunted, any mere personal perils that assail this poor, transient, perishing frame, I
may, without disparagement, compare with other men. But
there is a sort of courage, which, I frankly confess it, I do not
possess, a boldness to which I dare not aspire, a valor which I
cannot covet.  I cannot lay myself down in the way of the
welfare and happiness of my country.  That I cannot, I have
not the courage to do. I cannot interpose the power with
which I may be invested, a power conferred, not for my personal benefit, nor for my aggrandizement, but for my country's
good, to check her onward march to greatness and glory. I
have not courage enough. I am too cowardly for that. I would
not, I dare not, in the exercise of such a trust, lie down, and
place my body across the path that leads my country to prosperity and happiness.  This is a sort of courage widely different from that which a man may display in his private conduct
and personal relations. Personal or private courage is totally
distinct from that higher and nobler courage which prompts the
patriot to offer himself a voluntary sacrifice to his country's
good."
Apprehensions of the imputation of the want of firmness
sometimes impel us to perform rash and inconsiderate acts. It
is the greatest courage to be able to bear the imputation of the
want of courage. But pride, vanity, egotism, so unamiable and
offensive in private life, are vices which partake of the character of crimes, in the conduct of public affairs. The unfortunate
victim of these passions cannot see beyond the little, petty,
contemptible circle of his own personal interests.  All his
thoughts are withdrawn from his country, and concentrated on
his consistency, his firmness, himself.  The high, the exalted,
the sublime emotions of a patriotism, which, soaring toward
heaven, risesfar above all mean, low, or selfish things, and is ab3

Hum. I have held you a stout tug at argument this many a
year.
Sir Rob. And yet I could never teach you a syllogism.

I suspect he means to flatter him: now, I am rich, and hate
flattery. Ergo. When a poor man subscribes to my opinion, I

or I shall never get on.
Sir Rob. Well, get on. Be a poor man.
Hum. I am a poor man, and I argue with you, and convince
you you are wrong; then you call yourself a blockhead, and I
am of your opinion! Now, that's no flattery.
Sir Robert. Why, no; but when a man's of the same opinion
with me, he puts an end to the argument, and that puts an end
to conversation; so I hate him for that. But where's my
nephew, Frederick?
Hutm. Been out these two hours.
Sir Rob. An undutiful cub! Only arrived from Russia last
night, and though I told him to stay at home till I rose, he's
scampering over the fields like a Calmuc Tartar.

Sir Rob. He has a touch of our family. Don't you think
he's a little like me, Humphrey?
Hum. Bless you! not a bit: you are as ugly an old man as
ever I clapt my eyes on.
Sir Rob. Now that's impudent; but there's no flattery in it,
and it keeps up the independence of argument: his father, my
brother Job, is of as tame a spirit-Humphrey, you remember
my brother Job?
Hum. Yes: you drove him to Russia five and twenty years
ago.

Sir Rob. So has a duck-pond: he was a bit of still life-a
chip-weak water-gruel--a tame rabbit, boiled to rags, without
sauce or salt.  He received men's arguments with his mouth
open, like a poor-box gaping for halfpence, and good or bad he
swallowed them all without any resistance; we couldn't disagree, and so we parted.
Hum. And the poor, meek gentleman went to Russia for a
quiet life.
Sir Rob. A quiet life! why he married the moment he got
there, tacked himself to the shrew relict of a Russian merchant,
and continued a speculation with her in furs, flax, potashes,
tallow, linen, and leather; and what's the consequence? thirteen
months ago he broke.
Hum. Poor soul! his wife should have followed the business
for him.
Sir Rob. I fancy she did follow it, for she died just as it went
to the devil; and now this madcap, Frederick, is sent over to
me for protection. Poor Job! now he's in distress, I mustn't
neglect his son.               [Frederick is heard without.

Sir Rob. You had better be influenced by a rich old uncle;
unless you think the sun likely to leave you a fat legacy.
Fred. Sir, I hate fat legacies.
Sir Rob. Sir, that's mighty singular. They are pretty solil

Fred. Very melancholy tokens, uncle: they are posthumouas

I will obey you better in future; for they tell me you are a

Sir Rob. Now, who had the familiar impudence to tell you
that?
Fred. Old rusty, there.
Sir Rob. Why, Humphrey, you didn't?
Hum. Yes, but I did, though.
Fred. Yes, he did; and on that score I shall be anxious to
show you obedience; for'tis as meritorious to attempt sharing
a good man's heart, as it is paltry to have designs upon a rich
man's money. A noble nature aims its attentions full breast
high, uncle; a mean mind levels its dirty assiduities at the
pocket.

in my house, hunt my deer in high fevers, my fine fellow. Give

Sir Rob. Why, it was but last week, Gripe, the attorney,
received two cottages for him by law, worth sixty pounds.
Hum. And charged a hundred and ten for his trouble; so
seized the cottages for part of his bill, and threw Jonathan in
jail for the remainder.
Sir Rob. A harpy! I must relieve the poor fellow's distress.
Fred. And I must kick his attorney.
Hum. The curate's horse is dead.
Sir Rob. Pshaw! there's no distress in that.
Hum. Yes, there is, to a man that must go twenty miles
every Sunday, to preach three sermons, for thirty pounds a
year.
Sir Rob. Why wont Punmonk the vicar give him another
nag?
Hum. Because'tis cheaper to get another curate ready
mounted.
Sir Rob. What's the name of the black pad, I purchased
last Tuesday at Tunbridge?
Hum. Belzebub.
Sir Rob. Send Belzebub to the curate, and tell him to work
him as long as he lives.
Fred. And if you have a tumble-down-tit, send him to the
vicar, and give him a chance of breaking his neck.
Sir Rob. What else?
Hum. Somewhat out of the common. There's one lieutenant Worthington, a disabled officer, and a widower, come to
lodge at farmer Harrowby's, in the village; he's plaguy poor,
indeed, it seems; but more proud than poor, and more honest
than proud.
Fred. That sounds like a noble character.
Sir Rob. And so he sends to me for assistance.
Hum. He'd see you hanged first; Harrowby says, he'd
sooner die than ask any man for a shilling!-there's his daughter, and his dead wife's aunt, and an old corporal that has
served in the wars with him. He keeps them all upon halfpay.
Sir Rob. Starves them all, I'm afraid, Humphrey!
Fred. [Going.] Uncle, good morning.
421THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Sir Rob. Where are you running now?
Fred. To talk to lieutenant Worthington.
Sir Rob. And what may you be going to say,o him?
Fred. I can't tell till I encounter him, and then, uncle, when
I have an old gentleman by the hand, who is disabled in his
country's service, and struggling to support his motherless
child, a poor relation, and a faithful servant, in honorable indigence; impulse will supply me with words to express my sentiments.                                 [Hlurrying away.
Sir Rob. Stop, you rogue, I must be before you in this
business.
Fred. That depends upon who can run fastest; to start fair,
uncle, and here goes.                          [Runs off.
Sir Rob. Stop; why Frederick-a jackanapes-to take my
department out of my hands. I'll disinherit the dog for his
assurance.
Hum. No, you wont.
Sir Rob. Wont I?--but we'll argue that point as we gocome along Humphrey.

NORVAL and GLENALVON.
Glen. His port I love; he's in a proper mood
To chide the thunder, if at him it roared.   [Aside.
Has Norval seen the troops?
Norv. The setting sun
With yellow radiance lighted all the vale;
And as the warriors moved each polished helm,
Corselet, or spear, glanced back his gilded beams.
The hill they climbed; and halting at its top,
Of more than mortal size, towering, they seemed
A host angelic, clad in burning arms.
Glen. Thou talk'st it well; no leader of our host
In sounds more lofty speaks of glorious war.
Norv. If I should e'er acquire a leader's name,
My speech will be less ardent. Novelty
Now prompts my tongue, and youthful admiration
422SCENE FROM DOUGLASS.
Vents itself freely; since no part is mine
Of praise pertaining to the great in arms.
Glen. You wrong yourself, brave sir; your martial deeds
Have ranked you with the great. But mark me, Norval;
Lolrd Randolph's favor now exalts your youth
Above his veterans of famous service.
Let me, who know these soldiers, counsel you.
Give them all honor; seem not to command,
Else they will hardly brook your late-sprung power,
Which nor alliance props nor birth adorns..ATorv. Sir, I have been accustomed all my days
To hear and speak the plain and simple truth;
And though I have been told that there are men
Who borrow friendship's tongue to speak their scorn,
Yet in such language I am little skilled:
Therefore I thank Glenalvon for his counsel,
Although it sounded harshly. Why remind
Me of my birth obscure? Why slur my power
With such contemptuous terms?
Glen. I did not mean
To gall your pride, which now I see is great.
Norv. My pride!
Glen. Suppress it, as you wish to prosper.
Your pride's excessive. Yet, for Randolph's sake,
I will not leave you to its rash direction.
If thus you swell, and frown at high-born men,
Will high-born men endure a shepherd's scorn?
Norv. A shepherd's scorn?
Glen. Yes; if you presume
To bend on soldiers these disdainful eyes,
As if you took the measure of their minds,
And said in secret, You're no match for me,
What will become of you?
Norv. Hast thou no fears for thy presumptuous self?
Glen. Ha! dost thou threaten me?.Norv. Didst thou not hear?
Glen. Unwillingly I did; a nobler foe
Had not been questioned thus; but such as theeNVorv. Whom dost thou think me?
Glen. Norval.
ANorv. So I amAnd who is Norval in Glenalvon's eyes?
Glen. A peasant's son, a wandering beggar boy;
At best no more, even if he speaks the truth.
NYorv. False as thou art, dost thou suspect my truth?
423THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Glen. Thy truth! thou'rt all a lie; and false as hell
Is the vainglorious tale thou told'st to Randolph.
NVorv. If I were chained, unarmed, or bedrid old,
Perhaps I should revile; but as I am,
I have no tongue to rail. The humble Norval
Is of a race who strive not but with deeds.
Did I not fear to freeze thy shallow valor,
And make thee sink too soon beneath my sword,
I'd tell thee-what thou art. I know thee well.
Glen. Dost thou not know Glenalvon, born to command
Ten thousand slaves like thee?
Norv. Villain, no more!
Draw and defend thy life. I did design
To have defied thee in another cause;
But Heaven accelerates its vengeance on thee.
Now for my own and Lady Randolph's wrongs.
Lord Ran. [Enters.] Hold! I command you both! the man
Makes me his foe.                                [that stirs

That threat had vainly sounded, noble Randolph.
Glen. Hear him, my lord; he's wondrous condescending!
Mark the humility of shepherd Norval!
Norv. Now you may scoff in safety! [Sheathes his sword.
Lord Ran. Speak.not thus,
Taunting each other, but unfold to me
The cause of quarrel; then I judge betwixt you.
Norv. Nay, my good lord, though I revere you much,
My cause I plead not, nor demand your judgment.
I blush to speak: I will not, cannot speak
The opprobrious words that I from him have borne.
To the liege lord of my dear native land
I owe a subject's homage; but even him
And his high arbitration I'd reject.
Within my bosorm reigns another lord;
Honor, sole judge and umpire of itself.
If my free speech offend you, noble Randolph,
Revoke your favors, and let Norval go
Hence, as he came, alone, but not dishonored!
Lord Ran. Thus far I'll mediate with impartial voice;
The ancient foe of Caledonia's land
Now waves his banner o'er her frighted fields;
Suspend your purpose till your country's arms
Repel the bold invader; then decide
The private quarrel.

SCENE.-An anteroom in Evelyn's new house; at one corner, behind a large screen, Mr. SHARP, writing at a desk, books and
parchments before him.--Mr. CRIMSON, the portrait-painter;
Mr. CRAB, the publisher; Mr. TABOURET, the coachmaker; and
Mr. FRANTZ, the tailor.
Pat. [To Frantz, showing a drawing.] Yes, sir; this is the

Money makes the man, sir.

Enter EVELYN.
Eve. A levee, as usual. Good day. Ah, Tabouret, your
designs for the draperies; very well. And what do you want,
Mr. Crimson?
Crim. Sir, if you'd let me take your portrait, it would make
my fortune. Every one says you're the finest judge of paintings.
Eve. Of paintings! paintings! Are you sure I'm a judge
of paintings?
Crim. Oh, sir, didn't you buy the great Correggio for 40001.?
Eve. True-I see. So 40001. makes me an excellent judge
of paintings. I'll call on you, Mr. Crimson. Good day. Mr.
Grab-oh, you're the publisher who once refused me 51. for
my poem? you are right: is was sad doggerel.
Grab. Doggerel! Mr. Evelyn, it was sublime! But times
were bad then.
Eve. Very bad times with me.
Crab. But now, sir, if you give me the preference, I'll push
it, sir-I'll push it! I only publish for poets in high life, sir;
and a gentleman of your station ought to be pushed!-5001. for
the poem, sir!
Eve. 5001. when I don't want it, where 51. once would have
seemed a fortune.

Enter STOUT.
Eve. Stout, you look heated!
Stout. I hear you have just bought the great Groginhole
property.
Eve. It is true. Sharp says it's a bargain,
Stout. Well, my dear friend Hopkins, member for Groginhole,
can't live another month-but the interests of mankind forbid
regret for individuals! The patriot Popkins intends to start for
the borough the instant Hopkins is dead!-your interest will
secure his election!-now is your time! put yourself forward
in the march of enlightenment!--By all that is bigoted here
comes Glossmore!
Enter GLOSSMORE.
Gloss. So lucky to find you at home! Hopkins, of Groginhole,
is not long for this world. Popkins, the brewer, is already canvassing underhand (so very ungentlemanlylike!) Keep your
interest for young Lord Cipher, a valuable candidate. This is
an awful moment-the CONSTITUTION depends on his return!
Note for Cipher!
Stout. Popkins is your man!
-Eve. [Musingly.] Cipher and Popkins-Popkins and Cipher!
Enlightenment and Popkins--Cipher and the Constitution! I
AM puzzled! Stout, I am not known at Groginhole.
Stout. Your property's known there.
Eve. But purity of election-independence of votesStout. To be sure: Cipher bribes abominably. Frustrate his
schemes-preserve the liberties of the borough--turn every man
out of his house who votes against Enlightenment and Popkins!
Eve. Right!--down with those who take the liberty to admire any liberty except our liberty! That is liberty!
Gloss. Cipher has a stake in in the country-will have 50,
0001. a year--Cipher will never give a vote without considering
beforehand how people of 50,0001. a year will be affected by
the motion.
Eve. Right: for as without law there would be no property,
so to be the law for property is the only proper property of
law! That is law!
Stout. Popkins is all for economy-there's a sad waste of the
public money-they give the Speaker 5,0001. a year, when I've

Gloss. Enough, Mr. Stout. Mr. Evelyn has too much at
stake for a leveller.
Stout. And too much sense for a bigot.
Eve. Mr. Evelyn has no politics at all!-Did you ever play
at battledore?
Both. Battledore!
Eve. Battledore!-that is, a contest between two parties:
both parties knock about something with singular skill-something is kept up-high-low-here-there-everywhere-nowhere! How grave are the players! how anxious the bystanders? But when this something falls to the ground, only
fancy-it's nothing but cork and feather!  Go, and play by
yourselves--I'm no hand at it!
Stout. [Aside.] Sad ignorance!-Aristocrat!
Gloss. Heartless principles!--Parvenu!
~ Stout. Then you don't go against us?-I'll bring Popkins
to-morrow.
Gloss. Keep yourself free till I present Cipher to you.
Stout. I must go to inquire after Hopkins. The return of
Popkins will be an era in history.                   [Exit.
Gloss. I must be off to the club-the eyes of the country are
upon Groginhole. If Cipher fail, the constitution is gone! [Exit.
-Eve. [At table.] Sharp, come here, [Sharp advances,] let me
look at you! You are my agent, my lawyer, my man of business. I believe you honest; but what is honesty?-where
does it exist?-in what part of us?
Sharp. In the heart, I suppose.
Eve. Mr. Sharp, it exists in the pocket! Observe! I lay
this piece of yellow earth on the table-I contemplate you
both; the man there-the gold here! Now, there is many a
man in yonder streets, honest as you are, who moves, thinks,
feels, and reasons as well as we do; excellent in form-imperishable in soul; who, if his pockets were three days empty,
would sell thought, reason, body, and soul too, for that little
coin! Is that the fault of the man? -no! it is the fault of
mankind! God made man-Sir, behold what mankind have
made a god! When I was poor I hated the world; now I am
rich I despise it.  [Rises.]  Fools-knaves-hypocrites! By

God, and leaving at an immeasurable distance below all lesser,

The Dying       Alchymist.-N. P. WILLIS.
THE night wind with a desolate moan swept by;
And the old shutters of the turret swung
Screaming upon their hinges; and the moon,
As the torn edges of the clouds flew past,
Struggled aslant the stained and broken panes
So dimlny, that the watchful eye of death
Scarcely was conscious when it went and came.
The fire beneath his crucible was low;
Yet still it burned; and ever as his thoughts
Grew insupportable, he raised himself
Upon his wasted arm, and stirred the coals
With difficult energy, and when the rod
Fell fi-om his nerveless fingers, and his eye
Felt faint within its socket, he shrunk back
Upon his pallet, and with unclosed lips
Mu-ttered a curse on death I The silent room,
From its dim corners, mockingly gave back
His rattling breath; the humming in the fire
Had the distinctness of a knell; and when
Duly the antique horologe beat one,
He drewv a phial from beneath hlis head,
And drank. And instantly his lips compressed,
And, with a shudder in his skeleton frame,
He rose with supernatural strength, and sat
Upright, and communed with himself:I did not think to die
Till I had finished what I had to do;
I thought to pierce the eternal secret through
With this my mortal eye;

Graves. It is an atrocious world!-it will be set on fire c ie
day-and that's some comfort!
Eve. Every hour brings its gloomy lesson-the temper sours
-the affections wither-the heart hardens into stone! Zounds!
Sharp! what do you stand gaping there for?-have you no
bowels?--why don't you go and see to the bricklayer?
[Exit Sharp.
Eve. Graves, of all my new friends-and their name is
Legion-you are the only one I esteem; there is sympathy between us-we take the same views of life. I am cordially glad
to see you!
Graves. [Groaning.] Ah! why should you be glad to see a
man so miserable?
Eve. [Sighs.] Because I am miserable myself!
Graves. You! Pshaw! yoou have not been condemned to lose
a wife?
Eve. But, plague on it, man, I may be condemned to take one!
Sit down and listen. [They seat themselves.] I want a confidant!  Left fatherless when yet a boy, my poor mother
grudged herself food to give me education. Some one had told
her that learning was better than house and land-that's a lie,
Graves.
Graves. A scandalous lie, Evelyn!
Eve. On the strength of that lie I was put to school-sent
to college, a sizar. Do you know what a sizar is? In pride
he is a gentleman-in knowledge a scholar-and he crawls
about, amidst gentlemen and scholars, with the livery of a pauper on his back! I carried off the great prizes-I became distinguished-I looked to a high degree, leading to a fellowship;
that is, an independence for myself-a home for my mother.
One day a young lord insulted me-I retorted-he struck merefused apology-refused redress. I was a sizar! a Pariah!
a thing to be struck! Sir, I was at least a man, and I horsewhipped him in the hall before the eyes of the whole college!
A few days, and the lord's chastisement was forgotten. The
next day the sizar was expelled-the career of a life blasted.
That is the difference between rich and poor: it takes a whirlwind to move the one-a breath may uproot the other! I came
to London. As long as my mother lived I had one to toil for;
and I did toil-did hope-did struggle to be something yet.
She died, and then, somehow, my spirit broke-I resigned my
spirit to my fate-I ceased to care what became of me. At last
I submitted to be the poor relation-the hanger-on and gentleman-lackey of Sir John Vesey. But I had an object in that;
there was one in that house whom I had loved at the first sight!
428SCENE FROM MONEY.
Craves. And were you loved again?
Eve. I fancied it, and was deceived. Not an hcur before I
inherited this mighty wealth, I confessed my love, and was rejected because I was poor. Now, mark; you remember the
letter which Sharp gave me when the will was read?
Graves. Perfectly: what were the contents?
Eve. After hints, cautions, and admonitions--half in irony,
half in earnest, (Ah, poor Mordaunt had known the world!) it
proceeded-but I'll read it to you:
"Having selected you as my heir, because I think money a
trust to be placed where it seems likely to be best employed, I
now--not impose a condition, but ask a favor. If you have
formed no other and insuperable attachment, I could wish to
suggest your choice; my two nearest female relations are
my niece Georgina and my third cousin, Clara Douglas, the
daughter of a once dear friend. If you could see in either of
these one whom you could make your wife, such would be a marriage that, if I live long enough to return to England, I would
seek to bring about before I die."
My friend, this is not a legal condition; the fortune does not
rest on it; yet, need I say, that my gratitude considers it a
moral obligation? Several months have elapsed since thus
called upon-I ought now to decide: you hear the namesClara Douglas is the woman who rejected me!
Graves. But now she would accept you!
Eve. And do you think I am so base a slave to passion, that
I would owe to my gold what was denied to my affection?
Graves. But you must choose one in common gratitude; you
ought to do so-yes, there you are right.
Eve. Of the two, then, I would rather marry where I should
exact the least. A marriage, to which each can bring sober
esteem and calm regard, may not be happiness, but it may be
content. But to marry one whom vou could adore and whose
heart is closed to you-to yearn for the treasure, and only to
claim the casket-to worship the statue that you may never
warm to life-oh! such a marriage would be a hell the more
terrible because Paradise was in sight.
Graves. Georgina is pretty, but vain and frivolous. [Aside.]
But he has no right to be fastidious--he has never known
Maria!-[Aloud.] Yes, my dear friend, now I think on it, you
will be as wretched as myself! When.you are married we will
mingle our groans together!
Eve. You may misjudge Georgina; she may have a nobler

nature than appears on the surface. On the day, but before the
hour, in which the will was read, a letter, in a strange or disguised hand, "from an unknown Friend to Alfred Evelyn," and
enclosing what to a girl would have been a considerable sum,
was sent to a poor woman for whom I had implored charity,
and whose address I had given only to Georgina.
Graves. Why not assure yourself?
Eve. Because I have not dared. For sometimes, against my
reason, I have hoped that it might be Clara! [Taking a letter
from his bosom and looking at it.]  No, I can't recognize the
hand.  Graves, I detest that girl! [Rises.]
Graves. Who? Georgina?
Eve. No; but I've already, thank Heaven! taken some revenge upon her. Come nearer.     [Whispers.] I've bribed
Sharp to say that Mordaunt's letter to me contained a codicil
leaving Clara Douglas 20,0001.
Graves. And didn't it?
Eve. Not a farthing!  But I'm  glad of it-I've paid the
money-she's no more a dependant. No one can insult her
now-she owes it all to me, and does not guess it, man, does
not guess! owes it to me whom she rejected; me, the poor
scholar! Ha! ha! there's some spite in that, eh?
Graves. You're a fine fellow, Evelyn, and we understand each
other. Perhaps Clara may have seen the address, and dictated
this letter, after all!
Eve. Do you think so?--I'll go to the house this instant.
Graves. Eh?   Humph! Then I'll go with you. That

New   Netherlands and New          York.--ANOROFT.
SOMBRE forests shed a nmelancholy grandeur over the useless
magnificence of nature, and hid in their deep shades the rich
soil which the sun had never warmed. No axe had levelled
the giant progeny of the crowded groves, in which the fantastic
forms of withered limbs, that had been blasted and riven by
lightning, contrasted strangely with the verdant freshness of a
younger growth of branches.    The wanton grape-vine, seeming

by its own power to have sprung firom the earth, and to have
fastened its leafy coils on the top of the tallest forest tree,
swung in. the air with every breeze, like the loosened shrouds
of a ship. Trees might everywhere be seen breaking from
their root in the marshy soil, and threatening to fall with the
first rude gust; while the ground was strown with the ruins
of former forests, over which a profusion of wild flowers wasted
their freshness in mockery of the gloom. Reptiles sported in
the stagnant pools, or crawled unharmed over piles of mouldering trees. The spotted deer couched among the thickets; but
not to hide, for there was no pursuer; and there were none but
wild animals to crop the uncut herbage of the productive
prairies. Silence reigned, broken, it may have been, by the
flight of land-birds or the flapping of water-fowl, and rendered
more dismal by the howl of beasts of prey. The streams, not
yet limited to a channel, spread over sand-bars, tufted with
copses of willow, or waded through wastes of reeds; or slowly
but surely undermined the groups of sycamores that grew by
their side. The smaller brooks spread out into sedgy swamps,
that were overhung by clouds of mosquitoes; masses of decaying vegetation fed the exhalations with the seeds of pestilence,
and made the balmy air of the summer's evening as deadly as
it seemed grateful.  Vegetable life and death were mingled
hideously together. The horrors of corruption frowned on the
fruitless fertility of uncultivated nature.
And man, the occupant of the soil, was wild as the savage
scene, in harmony with the rude nature.by which he was surrounded; a vagrant over the continent, in constant warfare
with his fellow-man, the bark of the birch his canoe; strings of
shells his ornaments, his record, and his coin; the roots of the
forest among his resources for food; his knowledge in architecture surpassed, both in strength and durability, by the skill
of a beaver; bended saplings the beams of his house; the
branches and rind of trees its roof.; drifts of forest-leaves his
couch; mats of bulrushes his protection against the winter's
cold; his religion the adoration of nature; his morals the
promptings of undisciplined instinct; disputing with the wolves
and bears the lordship of the soil, and dividing with the

And how changed is the scene from that on which Hudson

of spring find their delight in orchards and trim gardens, variegated with choicest plants from every temperate zone; while
the brilliant flowers of the tropics bloom from the windows of
the green-house and the saloon. The yeoman, living like a
good neighbor near the fields he cultivates, glories in the fruitfulness of the valleys, and counts with honest exultation the
flocks and herds that bro'wse in safety on the hills. The thorn
has given way to the rosebush; the cultivated vine clambers
over rocks where the brood of serpents used to aestle; while
industry smiles at the changes she has wrought, mind inhales the
bland air which now has health on its wings.
And man is still in harmony with nature, which he has subdued, cultivated, and adorned. For him the rivers that flow to
remotest climes mingle their waters; for hp-im the lakes gain new
outlets to the ocean; for him the arch spans the flood, and
science spreads iron pathways to the recent wilderness; for
him the hills yield up the shining marble and the enduring
granite; for him the forests of the interior come down in immense rafts; for him the marts of the city gather the produce
of every clime, and libraries collect the works of genius of every
language and every age. The passions of society are chastened
into purity; manners are made benevolent by civilization; and
the virtue of the country is the guardian of its peace. Science
investigates the powers of every plant and mineral, to find
medicines for disease; schools of surgery rival the establishments of the Old World. An active daily press, vigilant from
party interests, free even to dissoluteness, watches the progress
of society, and communicates every fact that can interest humanity; the genius of letters begins to unfold his powers in the
warm sunshine of public favor. And while idle curiosity may
take its walk in shady avenues by the ocean side, commerce
pushes its wharves into the sea, blocks up the wide rivers with
its fleets, and, sending its ships, the pride of naval architecture,
to every clime, defies every wind, outrides every tempest, and
invades every zone.
American History.-VERPLANCK.
THE study of the history of most other nations fills the mind
with sentiments not unlike those which the American traveller
feels on entering the venerable and lofty cathedral of someAMERICAN HISTORY.
proud old city of Europe. Its solemn grandeur, its vastness, its
obscurity, strike awe to his heart. From the richly painted
windows, filled with sacred emblems and strange antique forms,
a dim religious.ight falls around. A thousand recollections of
romance and poetry, and legendary story, come thronging in
upon him. He is surrounded by the tombs of the mighty dead,
rich with the labors of ancient art, and emblazoned with the
pomp of heraldry.
What names does he read upon them? Those of princes and
nobles who are now remembered only for their vices; and of
sovereigns, at whose death no tears were shed, and whose memories lived not an hour in the affections of their people. There,
too, he sees other names, long familiar to him for their guilty or
ambiguous fame. There rest, the blood-stained soldier of fortune-the orator, who was ever the ready apologist of tyranny-great scholars, who were the pensioned flatterers of
power-and poets, who profaned the high gift of genius, to
pamper the vices of a corrupted court.
Our own history, on the contrary, like that poetical temple
of fame, reared by the imagination of Chaucer, and decorated
by the taste of Pope, is almost exclusively dedicated to the
memory of the truly great.  Or rather, like the Pantheon of
Rome, it stands in calm and severe beauty amid the ruins of
ancient magnificence and " the toys of modern state." Within,
no idle ornament encumbers its bold simplicity. The pure light
of heaven enters from above, and sheds an equal and serene
radiance around. As the eye wanders about its extent, it beholds the unadorned monuments of brave and good men who
have bled or toiled for their country, or it rests on votive tablets inscribed with the names of the best benefactors of mankind.
We have been repeatedly told, and sometimes, too, in a tone
of affected impartiality, that the highest praise which can fairly
be given to the American mind, is that of possessing an enlightened selfishness; that if the philosophy and talents of this
country, with all their effects, were forever swept into oblivion,
the loss would be felt only by ourselves; and that if to the aczuracy of this general charge, the labors of Franklin present an
illustrious, it is still but a solitary exception.
The answer may be given, confidently and triumphantly. Is
it nothing for the universal good of mankind to have carried into successful operation a system of self-government,
uniting personal liberty, freedom of opinion, and equality of
rights, with national power and digmity  such as had before ex55THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
isted only in the Utopian dreams of philosophers? Is it nothing,
in moral science, to have anticipated, in sober reality, numerous
plans of reform in civil and criminal jurisprudence, which are,
but now, received as plausible theories by the politicians and
economists of Europe? Is it nothing to have been able to call
forth on every emergeney, either in war or peace, a body of
talents always equal to the difficulty? Is it nothing to have,
in less than a half century, exceedingly improved the sciences of
political economy, of law, and of medicine, with all their auxiliary branches; to have enriched human knowledge by the accumulation of a great mass of useful facts and observations, and to
have augmented the power and the comforts of civilized man, by
miracles of mechanical invention?  Is it nothing to have given
the world examples of disinterested patriotism, of political wisdom, of public virtue; of learning, eloquence, and valor, never
exerted, save for some praiseworthy end? It' is sufficient to
have briefly suggested these considerations; every mind would
anticipate me in filling up the details.
No-Land of Liberty! thy children have no cause to blush
for thee. What though the arts have reared few monuments
among us, and scarce a trace of the Muse's footstep is found in
the paths of our forests, or along the banks of our rivers; yet
our soil has been consecrated by the blood of heroes, and by
great and holy deeds of peace. Its wide extent has become
one vast temple and hallowed asylum, sanctified by the prayers
and blessings of the persecuted of every sect, and the wretched
of all nations.
Land of Refuge!--Land of Benedictions! Those prayers
still arise, and they still are heard: " May peace be within thy
walls, and plenteousness within thy palaces!" " May there be
no decay, no leading into captivity, and no complaining in thy
streets!"  "May truth flourish out of the earth, and righteousness look down fiom Heaven!"
The American Forest Girl.-HEMANS.
WILDLY and mournfully the Indian drum
On the deep hush of moonlight forests broke;"Sing us a death-song, for thine hour is come,"--
So the red warriors to their captive spoke.
56THE AMERICAN FOREST GIRL.
Still, and amidst those dusky forms alone,
A youth, a fair-haired youth of England stood,
Like a king's son; though fronm his cheek had flown
The mantling crimson of the island blood,
And his pressed lips looked marble. Fiercely bright,
And high around him, blazed the fires of night,
Rocking beneath the cedars to and fro,
As the wind passed, and with a fitful glow
Lighting the victim's face. But who could tell
Of what within his secret heart befell,
Known but to Heaven that hour?-Perchance a thought
Of his far home, then so intensely wrought
That its full image, pictured to his eye
On the dark ground of mortal agony
Rose clear as day!-and he might see the band
Of his young sisters wandering hand in hand,
Where the laburnum drooped; or happily binding
The jasmine, up the door's low pillars winding;
Or, as day closed upon their gentle mirth,
Gathering with braided hair around the hearth
Where sat their mother;-and that mother's face
Its grave, sweet smile yet wearing in the place
Where so it ever smiled I Perchance the prayer
Learned at her knee caine back on his despair;
The blessings from her voice, the very tone
Of her " Good-night," might breathe from boyhood gone!
He started and looked up:-thick cypress boughs
Full of strange sound, waved o'er him, darkly red
In the broad, stormy firelight;--savage brows,
With tall plumes crested and wild hues o'erspread
Girt him like feverish phantoms; and pale stars
Looked through the branches as through dungeon bars,
Shedding no hope. He knew, he felt his doomOh! what a tale to shadow with his gloom
That happy hall in England! Idle fear!
Would the winds tell it? Who might dream or hear
The secret of the forest? To the stake
They bound him; and that proud young soldier strove
His father's spirit in his breast to wake,
Trusting to die in silence; He, the love
Of many hearts!-the fondly reared-the fair,
Gladdening all eyes to see! And fettered there
He stood beside his death-pyre, and the brand
Flamed up to,light it in the chieftain's hand.
He thought upon his God. Hush! hark!-a cry
Breaks on the stern and dread solemnityA step hath pierced the ring! Who dares intrude
On the dark hunters in their vengeful mood?
A girl-a young, slight girl-a fawn-like child
Of green savannas and the leafy wild,
Springing unmarked till then, as some lone flower,
Happy because the sunshine is its dower  
Yet one that knew how early tears are shed,
For hers had mourned a playmate brother dead.

She had sat gazing on the victim long,
Until the pity of her soul grew strong;
And, by its passion's deepening fervor swayed,
Even to the stake she rushed, and gently laid
His bright head on her bosom, and around
His form her slender arms to shield it wvound
Like close Liannes; then raised her glittering eye
An I clear-toned voice that said, " He shall not die I"
"l-e shall not die!"-the gloomy forest thrilled
To that sweet sound. A sudden wonder fell
On the fierce throng; and heart and hand were stilled,
Struck down, as by the whisper of a spell.
They gazed: their dark souls oowed before the maid,
She of the dancing step in wo-od and glade!
And, as her cheek flushed through its olive hue,
As her black tresses to the nlight-wvind flew,
Something o'ermastered them from that young mien;
Something of heaven, in silence felt and seen;
And seeming, to their child-like faith, to token
That the Great Spirit by her voice had spoken,
They loosed the bonds that held their captive's breath;
From his pale lips they took the cup of death:
They quenched the brand beneath the cypress tree;
"Away," they cried, "young stranger, thou art free!"
Liberty and Greatness.-LEGARE.
THE name of REPUBLIC is inscribed upon the most imperishable monuments of the species, and it is probable that it will continue to be associated, as it has been in all past ages, with whatever is heroic in character, and sublime in genius, and elegant
and. brilliant in the cultivation of arts and letters.  It would
not have been difficult to prove that the base hirelings who, in
this age of legitimacy anld downfall, have so industriously inculcated a contrary doctrine, have been compelled to falsify
history and abuse reason.  I might have " called up antiquity
from the old schools of Greece" to show that these apostles of
despotism  would have passed at Athens for barbarians and
slaves.  I might have asked triumphantly, what land had ever
been visited with the influences of liberty, that did not flourish
like the spring?  What people had ever w-orshipped at her
altars, without kindling with a loftier spirit and putting forth
mnore noble energies?  Where she had ever acted, that herLIBERTY AND GREATNESS.
deeds had not been heroic? Where she had ever spoken, that
her eloquence had not been triumphant and sublime? It might
hlave been demonstrated that a state of society in which nothing is obtained by patronage-nothing is yielded to the accidents of birth and fortune-where those who are already distinguished, must exert themselves lest they be speedily eclipsed
by their inferiors, and these inferiors are, by every motive,
stimulated to exert themselves that they may become distinguished-and where, the lists being open to the whole world,
without any partiality or exclusion, the champion who bears off
the prize must have tasked his powers to'the very uttermost, and
proved himself the first of a thousand competitors-is necessarily more favorable to a bold, vigorous and manly way of thinking and acting, than any other.  I should have asked with
Longinus--who but a Republican could have spoken the philippics of Demosthenes? and what has the patronage of despotism ever done to be compared with the spontaneous productions
of the Attic, the Roman, and the Tuscan muse?
With respect to ourselves, would it not be enough to say that
we live under a form of government and in a state of society to
which the world has never yet exhibited a parallel? Is it then
nothing to be free? How many nations, in the whole annals of
human kind, have proved themselves worthy of being so? Is
it nothing that we are Republicans? Were all men as enlightened, as brave, as proud as they ought to be, would they suffer
themselves to be insulted with any other title? Is it nothing,
that so many independent sovereignties should be held together
in such a confederacy as ours? What does history teach us of
the difficulty of instituting and maintaining such a polity,.and
of the glory that, of consequence, ought to be given to those
who enjoy its advantages in so much perfection and on so grand
a scale? For, can anything be more striking and sublime, than
the idea of an IMPERIAL REPUBLIC, spreading over an extent of
territory more immense than the empire of the Caesars, in the
accumulated conquests of a thousand years--without pruefects
or proconsuls or publicans-founded in the maxims of common
sense-employing within itself no arms, but those of reasonand known to its subjects only by the blessings it bestows or
perpetuates, yet capable of directing, against a foreign foe, all'
the energies of a military despotism--a Republic, in which men
are completely insignificant, and principles and laws exercise,
throughout its vast dominion, a peaceful and irresistible sway,
blending in one divine harmony such various habits and conflicting opinions, and mingling in our institutions the light of phi59THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.

achievement and extended domination, and deep-seated and
formidable power!
Character of Washington.-FIsHEzR AMs.
GREAT generals have arisen in all ages of the world, and
perhaps most in those of despotism and darkness. In times of
violence and convulsion, they rise, by the force of the whirlwind, high enough to ride in it, and direct the storm. Like
meteors, they glare on the black clouds with a splendor, which,
while it dazzles and terrifies, makes nothing visible but the darkness. The fame of heroes is indeed growing vulgar; they
multiply in every long war; they stand in history, and thicken
in their ranks, almost as undistinguished as their own soldiers.
But such a chief magistrate as Washington appears like
the pole-star in a clear sky, to direct the skillful statesman.
His Presidency will form an epoch, and be distinguished as the
age of Washington.   Like the milky way, it whitens along its
alloted portion of the hemisphere. The latest generations of
men will survey, through the telescope of history, the space
where so many virtues blend their rays, and delight to separate them into groups and distinct virtues. As the best illustration of them, the living monument, to which the first of
patriots would have chosen to consign his fame, it is my earnest
prayer to heaven, that our country may subsist, even to that
late day, in the plenitude of its liberty and happiness, and mingle its mild glory with Washington's.
Nature's Gentleman.-ELIzA COOK.
WHowa do we dub as gentleman?-the knave, the fool, the brute--
If they but own full tithe of gold, and wear a courtly suit!
The parchment scroll of titled line-the ribbon at the knee,
Can still suffice to ratify and grant suchl high degree:
But Nature, with a matchless hand, sends forthi Hri nobly born,
And laughs the paltry attributes of wealth and rank to scorn;
Shle moulds with care a spirit rare, half human, half divine,
And cries, exulting,; "Who can make a gentleman like mine?"
60NATU'RE'S GENTLEMAN.
She may not spend her common skill about the outward part,
But showers her beauty, grace, and light upon the brain and heart;
She may not choose ancestral fame his pathway to illumeThe sun that sheds the brightest day may rise from mist and gloom:
Should fortune pour her welcome store and useful gold abound,
He shares it with a bounteous hand, and scatters blessings round;
The treasure sent is rightly spent, and serves the end designed,
When held by Nature's gentleman-the good, the just, the kind.
He turns not from the clheerless home where sorrow's offspring dwell;
He'll greet the peasant in his hut-the culprit in his cell;
IHe stays to hear the widow's plaint of dee1 and mourning love;
He seeks to aid her lot below, and prompt her faith above:
The orphan child-the friendless one-the luckless, or the poor,
Will never meet his spurning frown, or leave his bolted door;
His kindred circles all mankind-his country all the globeAn honest name his jewelled star, and truth his ermine robe.
He wisely yields his passions up to reason's firm control;
His pleasures are of crimeless kind, and never taint the soul;
He may be thrown among tlle gay and reckless sons of life,
But will not love the revel scene, or heed the brawling strife.
He wounds no breast with jeer or jest, yet bears no honeyed tongue  
He's social with the grey-haired one, and merry with the young;
He gravely shares the council speech, or joins the rustic game,
And shines as Nature's gentleman in every place the same.
No haughty gesture marks his gait, no pompous tone his word,
No studied attitude is seen, no palling nonsense heard;
He'll suit his bearing to the hour-laugh, listen, learn, or teach;
With joyous freedom in his mirth, and candor in his speech:
He worships God with inward zeal, and serves- him in each deed;
He would not blame another's faith, nor have one martyr bleed:
Justice and Mercy form his code-he puts his trust in Heaven;
His prayer is, " lf the heart mean well, may all else be forgiven!"
Though few of such may gem the earth, yet such rare gems there are,
Each shining in his hallowed sphere, as virtue's polar star;
Though human hearts too oft are found all gross, corrupt, and dark,
Yet-yet some bosoms breathe and burn, lit by Promnethean spark:
There are some spirits nobly just, unwarped by pelf or pride,
Great in the calm, but greater still when dashed by adverse tide:
They hold the rank no king can give-no station can disgrace;
Nature puts forth HER gentlemen, and monarchs must give place.
Discovery and Conquest of America.-JAMEs MONTGOMERY
THEa\T first Columbus, with the mighty hand
Of grasping genius, weighed the sea and land;
61THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
The floods'er,lanced: where the tide of light,
Day after day, rolled down the gulf of night,
There seemed one waste of waters: long in vain
His spirit brooded o'er the Atlantic main;
When sudden, as creation burst from naught,
Sprang a new world through his stupendous thought,
Light, order, beauty!-While his mind explored
The unveiling mystery, his heart adored;
Where'er sublime imagination trod,
He heard the voice, he saw the face, of God.
The winds were prosperous, and the billows bore
The brave adventurer to the promised shore;
Far in the west, arrayed in purple light,
Dawned the new world on his enraptured sight:
Not Adam, loosened from the encumbering earth,
Waked by the breath of God to instant birth,
With sweeter, wilder wonder gazed around,
When life within, and light without, he found;
When, all creation rushing o'er his soul,
He seemed to live and breathe throughout the whole.
So felt Columbus, when divinely fair,
At the last look of resolute despair,
The Hesperian isles, from distance dimly blue,
With gradual beauty opened on his view.
In that proud moment his transported mind
The morning and the evening worlds combined,
And made the sea, that sundered them before,
A bond of peace, uniting shore to shore.
Vain, visionary hope! rapacious Spain
Followed her hero's triumph o'er the main,
Her hardy sons in fields of battle tried,
Where Moor and Christian desperately died.
A rabid race, fanatically bold,
And steeled to cruelty by lust of gold,
Traversed the waves, the unknown world explored,
The cross their standard, but their faith the sword;
Their steps were graves; o'er prostrate realms they trod;
They worshipped Mammon while they vowed to God.
Let nobler bards in loftier numbers tell
How Cortez conquered, Montezuma fell:
HIow fierce Pizarro's ruffian arm o'erthrew
The sun's resplendent empire in Peru;
How, like a prophet, old Las Casas stood,
And raised his voice against a sea of blood,
Whose chilling waves recoiled, while he foretold
His country's ruin by avenging gold.
That gold, for which unpitied Indians fell,
That gold, at once the snare and scourge of hell,
Thenceforth by righteous IIeaeln was doomed to shed
Unmingled cLuses on the spoiler's head;
For gold the Spaniard cast his soul awayHiLs gold and lie were every nation's prey.
62RETURN OF COLUMBUS.
Columbus at Barcelona, on          his return from       the
Discovery of America.-WAsHINGTON IRVING.
TiE letter of Columbus to the Spanish monarchs, announcing
his discovery, had produced -the greatest sensation at court.
The event it communicated was considered the most extraordinary'of their prosperous reign; and following so close upon
the conquest of Granada, was pronounced a signal mark of divine
favor for that triumph achieved in the cause of the true faith.
The sovereigns themselves were for a time dazzled and bewildered by this sudden and easy acquisition of a new empire,
of indefinite extent, and apparently boundless wealth; and their
first idea was to secure it beyond the reach of question or competition. Shortly after his arrival in Seville, Columbus received
a letter from them, expressing their, great delight, and requesting him to repair immediately to court, to concert plans for a
second and mor6 extensive expedition. As the summer was
already advancing, the time favorable for a voyage, they desired
him to make any arrangements at Seville, or elsewhere, that
might hasten the expedition, and to inform them by the return
of the courier what was necessary to be done on their part.
This letter was addressed to him by the title of " Don Christopher Columbus, our admiral of the Ocean sea, and viceroy and
governor of the islands discovered in the Indias;" at the same
time he was promised still further rewards.  Columbus lost no
time in complying with the commands of the sovereigns. He
sent a memorandum of the ships, men, and munitions that would
be requisite; and having made such dispositions at Seville as
circumstances permitted, set out on his journey for Barcelona,
taking with him the six Indians, and the various curiosities and
productions which he had brought from the New World.
The fame of his discovery had resounded throughout the nation, and as his route lay through several of the finest and most
populous provinces of Spain, his journey appeared like the progress of a sovereign. Wherever he passed, the surrounding
country poured forth its inhabitants, who lined the road and
thronged the villages. In the large towns, the streets, windows,
and balconies were filled with eager spectators, who rent the,
air with acclamations. His journey was continually impeded by
the multitude pressing to gain a sight of him, and of the Indians,
who were regarded with as much admiration as if they had
been natives of another planet. It was impossible to satisfy the
craving curiosity which assailed himself and his attendants, at
63THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
every stage, with innumerable questions; popular rumor as
usual had exaggerated the truth, and had filled the newvly found
country with all kinds of wonders.
It was about the middle of April that Columbus arrived at
Barcelona, where every preparation had been made to give him
a solemn and magnificent reception. The beauty and serenity
of the weather, in that genial season and favored climate, contributed to give splendor to this memorable ceremony. As he
drew near the place, many of the more youthful courtiers and
hidalgos of gallant bearing, together with a vast concourse of
the populace, came forth to meet and welcome him. His entrance into this noble city has been compared to one of those
triumphs which the Romans were accustomed to decree to conquerors. First were paraded the Indians, painted according to
their savage fashion, and decorated with tropical feathers. and
with their national ornaments of gold; after these were borne
various kinds of live parrots, together with stuffed birds and
animals of unknown species, and rare plants shlpposed to be of
precious qualities; while great care was taken to make a conspicuous display of Indian coronets, bracelets, and other decorations of gold, which might give an idea of the wealth of the
newly discovered regions. After these followed Columbus, on
horseback, surrounded by a brilliant cavalcade of Spanish chivalry. The streets were almost impassable from the countless
multitude; the windows and balconies were crowded with the
fair; the very roofs were covered with spectators. It seemed
as if the public eye could not be sated with gazing on these
trophies of an unknown world; or on the remarkable man
by whom it had been discovered. There was a sublimity in
this event that mingled a solemn feeling with the public joy.
It was looked upon as a vast and signal dispensation of Providence in reward for the piety of the monarchs; and the majestic and venerable appearance of the discoverer, so different
from the youth and buoyancy that are generally expected from
roving enterprise, seemed in harmony with the grandeur and
dignity of his achievement.
To receive him with suitable pomp and distinction, the sovereigns had ordered their throne to be placed in public, under a
rich canopy of brocade of gold, in a vast and splendid saloon.
Here the king and queen awaited his arrival, seated in state,
with the Prince Juan beside them; and attended by the dignitaries of their court, and the principal nobility of Castile, Valentia, Catalonia, and Aragon; all impatient to behold the man
who had conferred so incalculable a benefit upon the nation.
64RETURN OF COLUMBUS.
At length Columbus entered the hall, surrounded by a brilliant
crowd of cavaliers, among whom, says Las Casas, he was conspicuous for his stately and commanding person, which, with
his countenance rendered venerable by his gray hairs, gave him
the august appearance of a senator of Rome. A modest smile
lighted up his features, showing that he enjoyed the state and
glory in which he came; and certainly nothing could be more
deeply moving to a mind inflamed by noble ambition, and conscious of having greatly deserved, than these testimonials of
the admiration and gratitude of a nation, or rather of a world.
As Columbus approached, the sovereigns rose, as if receiving a
person of the highest rank. Bending his knees, he requested
to kiss their hands; but there was some hesitation on the part
of their majesties to permit this act of vassalage. Raising him
in the most gracious manner, they ordered him to seat himself
in their presence; a rare honor in this proud and punctilious
court.
At the request; of their majesties, Columbus now gave an account of the most striking events of his voyage, and a description of the islands which he had discovered. He displayed the
specimens he had brought of unknown birds and other animals;
of rare plants of medicinal and aromatic virtue; of native gold in
dust, in crude masses, or labored into barbaric ornaments; and
above all, the natives of these countries, who were objects of
intense and inexhaustible interest; since there is nothing to man
so curious as the varieties of his own species. All these he
pronounced mere harbingers of greater discoveries he had yet
to make, which would add realms of incalculable wealth to the
dominions of their majesties and whole nations of proselytes to
the true faith.
The words of Columbus were listened to with profound
emotion by the sovereigns. When he had finished, they sunk
on their knees, and, raising their clasped hands to heaven, their
eyes filled with tears of joy and gratitude, they poured forth
thanks and praises to God for so great a providence; all present followed their example, a deep and solemn enthusiasm pervaded that splendid assembly, and prevented all common acclamations of triumph. The anthem   of Te _Deum   laudamus,
chanted by the choir of the royal chapel, with the melodious
accompaniments of the instruments, rose up from the midst in a
full body of sacred harmony, bearing up as it were the feelings
and thoughts of the auditors to heaven, "so that," says the
venerable Las Casas, "it seemed as if in that hour they communicated with celestial delights."  Such was the solemn and
65THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
pious manner in which the brilliant court of Spain celebrated
this sublime event; off*ering up a grateful tribute of melody
and praise, and giving, glory to God for the discovery of another
world.
The   Voices of History.--R. MONaCTON MILNES.
THE poet in his vigil hears
Time flowing through the nightA mighty stream, absorbing tears,
And bearing down delight;
There, resting on his bank of thought
He listens, till his soul
The voices of the waves has caughtThe meaning of their roll.
First, wild and wildering as the strife
Of earthly winds and seas,
Resounds the long historic life
Of warring dynasties:
Uncertain right and certain wrong
In onward conflict driven,
The threats and tramplings of the strong
Beneath a brazen heaven.
The cavernous unsounded East
Outpours an evil tide,
Drowning the hymn of patriarch priest,
The chant of shepherd bride:
How can we catch the angel-word,
How mark the prophet-sound,
Mid thunders like Niagara's, heard
An hundred miles around a
From two small springs that rise and blend,
And leave their Latin home,
The waters East and West extendThe ocean-power of Rome;
Voices of victories ever-won,
Of pride that will not stay,
Billows that burst and perish on
The shores they wear away.
Till, in a race of fierce delight,
Tumultuous battle forth,
The snows amast on many a height,
The cataracts of the North;
66THE VOICES OF HISTORY.
What can we hear beside the roar,
What see beneath the foam,
What but the wrecks that strew the shore,
And cries of falling Rome?
Nor, when a purer faith had traced
Safe channels for the tide,
Did streams with Eden-lilies graced
In Eden-sweetness glide;
While the deluded gaze admires
The smooth and shining flow,
Vile interests and insane desires
Gurgle and rage below.
If history has no other sounds,
Why should we listen more?
Spirit! despise terrestrial bounds,
And seek a happier shore;
Yet pause! for on thine inner ear
A mystic music grows,
And mortal man shall never hear
That diapason's close.
Nature awakes! a rapturous tone,
Still different, still the sameEternal effluence from the throne
Of Him without a name;
A symphony of worlds begun,
Ere sin the glory mars,
The cymbals of the new-born sun,
The trumpets of the stars.'T!cen beauty all Ler subtlest chords
Dissolves and knits again,
And law composes jarring words
In one harmonious chain:
And loyalty's enchanting notes
Outswelling fade away,
While knowledge, from ten thousand throa*t
Proclaims a graver sway.
Well, if, by senses unbefooled,
Attentive souls may scan

The Present Age.--      CANNINO.
THE grand idea of humanity, of the importance of mall as
man, is spreading silently, but surely. Even the most abject
portions of society are visited by some dreams of a better condition for which they were designed. The grand doctrine, that
every human being should have the means of self-culture, of
progress in knowledge and virtue, of health, comfort, and happiness; of exercising the powers and affections of a man, this is
slowly taking its place as the highest social truth. That the
world was made for all, and not for a few; that society is to
care for all; that no human being shall perish but through his
own fault; that the great end of government is to spread a
shield over the rights of all-these propositions are growing
into axioms, and the spirit of them is coming forth in all the
departments of life....
The Present Age! In these brief words what a world of
thought is comprehended! what infinite movements! what joys
and sorrows! what hope and despair! what faith and doubt!
what silent grief and loud lament! what fierce conflicts and
subtle schemes of policy! what private and public revolutions!
68THE PRESENT AGE.
In the period through which many of us have passed, what
thrones have been shaken! what hearts have bled! what millions have been butchered by their fellow-creatures! what
hopes of philanthropy have been blighted! And at the same
time what magnificent enterprises have been achieved! what
new provinces won to science and art! what rights and liberties
secured to nations! It is a privilege to have lived in an age so
stirring, so pregnant, so eventful. It is an age never to be forgotten. Its voice of warning and encouragement is never to
die. Its impression on history is indelible. Amidst its events,
the American Revolution, the first distinct, solemn assertion of
the rights of men, and the French Revolution, that volcanic
force which shook the earth to its centre, -are never to pass from
men's minds. Over this age the night will indeed gather more
and more as time rolls away; but in that night two forms will
appear, Washington and Napoleon, the one a lurid meteor, the
other a benign, serene, and undecaying star. Another American
name will live in history, your Franklin; and the kite which
brought lightning from heaven will be seen sailing in the clouds
by remote posterity, when the city where he dwelt may be
known only by its ruins. There is, however, something greater
in the age than in its greatest men; it is the appearance of a
new power in the world, the appearance of the multitude of
men on that stage where as yet the few have acted their
parts alone. This influence is to endure to the end of time.
What more of the present is to survive? Perhaps much, of
which we now take no note. The glory of an age is often
hidden from itself.  Perhaps some word has been spoken
in our day which we have not deigned to hear, but which
is to grow  clearer and louder through all ages.  Perhaps
some silent thinker among us is at work in his closet whose
name is to fill the earth.  Perhaps there sleeps in his cradle some reformer who is to move the church and the
world, who is to open a new era in history, who is to fire
the human soul with new hope and new daring. What else
is to survive the age? That which the age has little thought
of, but which is living in us all; I mean the Soul, the Immortal Spirit. Of this all ages are the unfoldings, and it is
greater than all. We must not feel, in the contemplation of
the vast movements of our own and former times, as if we ourselves were nothing. I repeat it, we are greater than all. We
are to survive our age, to comprehend it, and to pronounce its
sentence. As yet, however, we are encompassed with darkness. The issues of our time, how obscure! The future, into

which it opens, who of us can foresee? To the' Father of all
Ages I commit this future with humble, yet courageous and
unfaltering hope.
Literature and Liberty.-EDwARD EVERETT.
LITERATURE is the voice of the age and the state. The character, energy, and resources of the country are reflected and
imaged forth in the conceptions of its great minds. They are
organs of the time; they speak not their own language, they
scarce think their own thoughts; but under an impulse like the
prophetic enthusiasm of old, they must feel and utter the sentiments which society inspires. They do not create, they obey
the spirit of the age; the serene and beautiful spirit descended
from the highest heaven of liberty, who laughs at our preconceptions, and, with the breath of his mouth, sweeps before him
the men and the nations that cross his path. By an unconscious instinct, the mind, in the action of its powers, adapts
itself to the number and complexion of the other minds with
which it is to enter into commuunion or conflict. As the voice
falls into the key which is suited to the space to be filled, the
mind, in the various exercises of its creative faculties, strives
with curious search for that master-note, which will awaken a
vibration from the surrounding community, and which, if it do
not find it, is itself too often struck dumb.
For this reason, from the moment in the destiny of nations,
that they descend from their culminating point, and begin to
decline, from that moment the voice of creative genius is hushed,
and at-best, the age of criticism, learning, and imitation succeeds. When Greece ceased to be independent, the forum and
the stage became mute. The patronage of Macedonian, Alexandrian, and Pergamean princes was lavished in vain. They
could not woo the healthy- Muses of Hellas, from  the cold
mountain-tops of Greece, to dwell in their gilded halls. Nay,
though the fall of greatness, the decay of beauty, the waste of
strength, and the wreck of power have ever been among the
favorite themes of the pensive muse, yet not a poet arose in
Greece to chant her own elegy; and it is after near three centuries, and. from Cicero and Sulpicius, that we catch the first

Discretionary Powers of Congress.-w. PINKNEY.
TIME, that withers the strength of man and "strews around
him, like autumnal leaves, the ruins of his proudest monuments,"
produces great vicissitudes in modes of thinking and feeling. It
brings along with it, in its progress, new circumstances-new
combinations and modifications of the old-generating new
views, motives, and caprices--new fanaticisms of endless variety
-in short, new every thing.  We ourselves are always changing-and what to-day we have but a small desire to attempt,
to-morrow becomes the object of our passionate aspirations.
There is such a thing as enthusiasm, moral, religious, or political, or a compound of all three; and it is wonderful what it
will attempt, and from what imperceptible beginnings it sometimes rises into a mighty agent. Rising from some obscure or
unknown source, it first shows itself a petty rivulet, which
scarcely murmurs over the pebbles that obstruct its way-then
it swells into a fierce torrent, bearing all before it-and then
again, like some mountain stream which occasional rains have
precipitated upon the valley, it sinks once more into a rivulet,
and finally leaves its channel dry.  Such a thing has happened.
I do not say that it is now happening. It would not become
me to say so. But if it should occur, woe to the unlucky territory that should be struggling to make its way into the Union
at the moment when the opposinlg inundation was at its height,
and at the same instant this wide Mediterranean of discretionary
powers, which it seems is ours, should open all its sluices, and,
with a consentaneous rush, mingle with the turbid waters of
the others.THE PRISONER OF CHILLON.
The Prisoner of        Chillon.-BYRON.
THEY chained us each to a column stone,
And we were three-yet, each alone:
We could not move a single pace,
We could not see each other's face,
But with that pale and livid light
That made us strangers in our sight;
And thus together-yet apart,
Fettered in hand, but pined in heart;'Twas still some solace, in the dearth
Of the pure elements of earth,
To hearken to each other's speech,
And each turn comforter to each
With some new hope, or legend old,
Or song heroically bold;'But even these at length grew cold.
Our voices took a dreary tone,
An echo of the dungeon-stone,
A grating sound-not full and free,
As they of yore were wont to be;
It might be fancy-but to me
They never sounded like our own.
I was the eldest of the three,
And to uphold and cheer the rest
I ought to do-and did my bestAnd each did well in his degree.
The youngest, whom my father loved,
Because our mother's brow was given
To him-with eyes as blue as heaven,
For him my soul was sorely moved;
And truly might it be distrest
To see such bird in such a nest;
The other was as pure of mind,
But formed to combat with his kind;
Strong in his frame, and of a mood
Which'gainst the world in war had stood
And perished in the foremost rank
With joy; but not in chains to pine:
His spirit withered with their clank,
I saw it silently declineAnd so perchance in sooth did mine;
But yet I forced it on to cheer
Those relics of a home so dear.
He was a hunter of the hills,
Had followed there the deer and wolf;
To him this dungeon was a gulf
And fettered feet the worst of ills.
I said my nearer brother pined,
I said his mighty heart declined:

He loathed and put away his food:
It was not that'twas coarse and rude,
For we were used to hunter's fare,
And for the like had little care:
The milk drawn from the mountain goat
Was changed for water from the moat;
Our bread was such as captives' tears
Have moistened many a thousand years,
Since man first pent his fellow-men
Like brutes within an iron den;
BBut what were these to us or him?
These wasted not his heart or limb;
My brother's soul was of that mould
Which in a palace had grown cold,
Had his free breathing been denied
The range of the steep mountain's side;
But vwhy delay the truth?-he died.
But he, the favorite and the flower,
Most cherished since his natal hour,
His mother's image in fair face,
The infant love of all his race,
His martyred father's dearest thought,
My latest care, for whom I sought
To hoard my life, that his might be
Less wretched now, and one day free;
He, too, who yet had held untired
A spirit natural or inspiredHe, too, was struck, and day by day
Was withered on the stalk away.
Oh (od! it is a fearful thing
To see the human soul take wing
In any shape, in any mood:
I've seen it rushing forth in blood;
I've seen it on the breaking ocean
Strive with a swoln convulsive motion;
I've seen the sick and ghastly bed

So softly worn, so sweetly weak,

Whose tints as gently sunk away

For I was sunk in silence-lost
In this last loss, of all the most;
And then the sighs he would suppress
Of fainting nature's feebleness,
More slowly drawn, grew less and less:
I listened, but I could not hearI called, for I was wild with fear;
I knew'twas hopeless, but my dread
Would not be thus admonished;
I called, and thought I heard a soundI burst my chain with one strong bound.
And rushed to him: I found him not,

THE country about the head-waters of the great Mohegan,
(as the Hudson is sometimes called,) though abounding in game
and fish, was never, in the recollection of the oldest Indians
living, nor in that of their fathers' fathers, the permanent residence of any one tribe.   From the black mountain tarns, where
the eastern fork takes its rise, to the silver strand of Lake Pleasant, through which the western branch makes its way after rising in Sacondaga Lake, the wilderness that intervenes, and all
the mountains round about the fountain-heads of the great river,
have, from time immemorial, been infested by a class of beings
with whom no good man would ever wish to come in contact.
The young men of the Mohawk have, indeed, often traversed
it, when, in years gone by, they went on the war-path after the
hostile tribes of the north; and the scattered and wandering
remnants of their people, with an occasional hunting-partv from
the degenerate bands that survive at St. Regis, will yet occa75THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
sionally be tempted over these haunted grounds in quest of the
game that still finds a reftge in that mountain reoion. The
evil shapes that were formerly so troublesome to the red hunter,
seem, in these later days, to have become less restless at his
presence; and, whether it be that the day of their power has
gone by, or that their vindictiveness has relented at witnessing
the fate which seems to be universally overtaking the people
whom they once delighted to persecute-certain it is, that the
few Indians who now find their way to this part of the country
are never molested, except by the white settlers who are slowly
extending their clearings among the wild hills of the north.
The "FLYING HEAD," which is supposed to have first driven
the original possessors of these hunting-grounds, whosoever
they were, from their homes, and which, as long as tradition
runneth back, in the old day before the whites came hither,
guarded them fiom the occupancy of every neighboring tribe,
has-not been seen for many years by any credible witness, though
there are those who insist that it has more than once appeared
to them, hovering, as their fathers used to describe it, over the
lake in which it first had its birth. The existence of this fearfiil monster, however, has never been disputed. Rude representations of it are still occasionally met with in the crude
designs of those degenerate aborigines who earn a scant subsistence by making birchen baskets and ornamented pouches for
such travellers as are curious in their manufacture of wampum
and porcupine quills; and the onigin and history of the Flying
Head survives, while even the name of the tribe whose crimes
first called it into existence, has passed away for ever.
It was a season of great severity with that.forgotten people
whose council-fires were lighted on the mountain promontory
that divides Sacondaga from the sister lake into which it discharges itself.
A long and severe winter, with but little snow, had killed
thle herbage at its roots, and the moose and deer had trooped
off to the more luxuriant pastures along the Mohawk, whither
the hunters of the hills dared not follow them. The fishing,
too, failed; and the famine became so devouring among the
mountains, that whole families, who had no hunters to provide
for them, perished outright.  The young men would no longer
throw the slender product of the chase into the common stock,
and the women and children had to maintain life as well as they
could upon the roots and berries the woods afforded them.
The sufferings of the tribe became at lenoth so galling, that
the young and enterprising began to talk of migrating from the

ancient seat of their people; and, as it was impossible, surrounded as they were by hostile tribes, merely to shift their
hunting-grounds for a season and return to them at some more
auspicious period, it was proposed that if they could effect a
secret march to the great lake off to the west of them, they
should launch their canoes upon Ontario, and all move away to
a new home beyond its broad waters. The wild rice, of which
some had been brought into their country by a runner from a
distant nation, would, they thought, support them in their perilous voyage along the shores of the great water, where it grows
in such profusion; and they believed that, once safely beyond
the lake, it would be easy enough to find a new home abounding in game upon those flowery plains which, as they had heard,
lay like one immense garden beyond the chain of inland seas.
The old men of the tribe were indignant at the bare suggestion of leaving the bright streams and sheltered valleys, amid
which their spring-time of life had passed so happily. They
doubted the existence of the garden regions of which their
children spoke; and they thought that if there were indeed
such a country, it was madness to attempt to reach it in the way
proposed. They said, too, that the famine was a scourge which
the Master of Life inflicted upon his people for their crimes;
that if its pains were endured with the constancy and firmness
that became warriors, the visitation would soon pass away;
but that those who fled from it would only war with their destiny, and that chastisement would follow them, in some shape,
wheresoever they might flee. Finally, they added that they
would rather perish by inches on their native hills-they would
rather die that moment, than leave them for ever, to revel in
plenty upon stranger plains.
" Be it so; they have spoken!" exclaimed a fierce and insolent youth, springing to his feet and casting a furious glance
around the council as the aged chief, who had thus addressed
it, resumed his seat. "Be the dotard's words their own, my
brothers; let them die for the crimes they have even now acknowledged. We know of none; our unsullied summers have
nothing to blush for. It is they that have drawn this curse
upon our people: it is for them that our vitals are consuming
with anguish, while our strength wastes away in the search of
sustenance we cannot find; or which, when found, we are compelled to share with those for whose misdeeds the Great Spirit
hath placed it far from us. They have spoken-let them die.

carcases, may then nerve the limbs of our young hunters, or keep
our children from perishing. Let them die, if we are to move
hence, for their presence will but bring a curse upon our path:
their worn-out frames will give way upon the march; and the
raven that hovers over their corses will guide our enemies to
the spot, and scent them like wolves upon our trail. Let them
die, my brothers; and, because they are still our tribesmen, let
us give them the death of warriors, and that before we leave
this ground."
And with these words the young barbarian, pealing forth a
ferocious whoop, buried his tomahawk in the head of the ol0(
man nearest to him. The infernal yell was echoed on every
side; a dozen flint hatchets were instantly raised by as many
remorseless arms, and the massacre was wrought before one of
those thus horribly sacrificed could interpose a plea of mercy.
But for mercy they would not have pleaded, had opportunity
been afforded them; for even in the moment that intervened
between the cruel sentence and its execution, they managed to
show that stern resignation to the decrees of fate which an
Indian warrior ever exhibits when death is near; and each of
the seven old men that perished thus barbarously, drew his
wolf-skin mantle around his shoulders and nodded his head, as
if inviting the death-blow that followed.
The parricidal deed was done! and it now became a question how to dispose of the remains of those whose lamp of life,
while twinkling in the socket, had been thus fearfully quenched
for ever. The act, though said to have been of not unfrequent
occurrence among certain Indian trlibes at similar exigencies, was
one utterly abhorrent to the nature of most of our aborigines; who,
from their earliest years, are taught the deepest veneration for
the aged. In the present instance, likewise, it had been so outrageous a perversion of their customary views of duty among
this simple people, that it was thought but proper to dispense
with their wonted mode of sepulture, and dispose of the victims of famine and fanaticism in some peculiar manner. They
wished in some way to sanctify the deed, by offering up the
bodies of the slaughtered to the Master of Life, and that without dishonoring the dead. It was, therefore, agreed to decapitate the bodies and burn them; and as the nobler part could
not, when thus dissevered, be buried with the usual forms, it
was determined to sink the heads together to the bottom of the
lake.
The soulless trunks were accordingly consumed, and the
ashes scattered to the winds. The heads were then deposited

sinl,gy,  separate canoes, which were pulled off in a kind of
procession from the shore. The young chief who had suggested the bloody scene of the sacrifice, rowed in advance, in order
to designate the spot where they were to disburden themselves
of their gory freight. Resting then upon his oars, he received
each head in succession from his companions, and proceeded to
tie them together by their scalp-locks, in order to sink the whole,
with a huge stone, to the bottom. But the vengeance of the
Master of Life overtook the wretch before his horrid office was
accomplished; for no sooner did he receive the last head into
his canoe than it began to sink, his feet became entangled in the
hideous chain he had been knotting together, and, before his
horror-stricken companions could come to his rescue, he was
dragged, shrieking, to the bottom. The others waited not to
see the water settle over him, but pulled with their whole
strength for the shore.
The morning dawned calmly upon that unhallowed water,
which seemed at first to show no traces of the deed it had witnessed the night before. But gradually, as the sun rose up
higher, a few gory bubbles appeared to float over one smooth
and turbid spot, which the breeze never crisped into a ripple.
The parricides sat on the bank watching it all the day; but
sluggish, as at first, that sullen blot upon the fresh blue surface
still remained. Another day passed over their heads, and the
thick stain-was yet there. On the third day the floating slime
took a greener hue, as if colored by the festering mass beneath;
but coarse fibres of darker dye marbled its surface; and on the
foutth day these began to tremble along the water like weeds
growing from the bottom, or the long tresses of a woman's scalp
floating in a pool when no wind disturbs it. The fifth morning
came, and the conscience-stricken watchers thought that the
spreading-scalp-for such now all agreed it was--had raised
itself from the water, and become rounded at the top, as if
there were a head beneath it. Some thougbt, too, that they
could discover a pair of hideous eyes glaring beneath the dripping locks. They looked on the sixth, and there indeed was a
monstrous HEAD floating upon the surface, as if anchored to the
spot, around which the water--notwithstanding a blast which
swvept the lake-was calm and motionless as ever.
Those bad Indians then wished to fly; but the doomed parricides had not now the courage to encounter the warlike bands
through which they must make their way in fleeing from their
native valley. They thought, too, that, as nothing about the
head, except the eyes, had motion, it could not harm them,
79THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
resting quietly, as it did, upon the bosom of the waters.
And, though it was dreadful to have that hideous gaze fixed
for ever upon their dwellings, yet they thought that if the Master of Life meant this as an expiation for their phrenzied deed,
they would strive to live on beneath those unearthly glances
without shrinking or complaint
But a strange alteration had taken place in the floating head
on the morning of the seventh day. A pair of broad wings,
ribbed, like those of a bat, and with claws appended to each
tendon, had grown out during the night; and, buoyed up by
these, it seemed to be now resting on the water. The water
itself appeared to ripple more briskly near it, as if joyous that it
was about to be relieved of its unnatural burden; but still, for
hours, the head maintained its first position. At last the wind
began to rise, and, driving through the trough of the waves beneath their expanded membrane, raised the wings from the
surface, and seemed for the first time to endow them with
vitality. They flapped harshly once or twice upon the billows,
and the head rose slowly and heavily from the lake.
An agony of fear seized upon the gazing parricides, but the
supernatural creation made no movement to injure them. It
only remained balancing itself over the lake, and casting a
shadow from its wings that wrapped the valley in gloom. But
dreadful was it beneath their withering shade to watch that terrible monster, hovering like a falcon for the stoop, and know
lot upon what victim it might descend. It was then that they
who had sown the gory seed from which it sprung to life, with
one impulse sought to escape its presence by flight. Herding
together like a troop of deer when the panther is prowling by,
they rushed in a body from the scene. But the flapping of the
demon pinions was soon heard behind them, and the winged
head was henceforth on their track wheresoever it led.
In vain did they cross one mountain barrier after another,
plunge into the rocky gorge, or thread the mazy swamp, to escape their fiendish watcher. The Flying Head would rise on
tireless wings over the loftiest summit, or dart in arrowy flight
through the narrowest passages without furling its pinions:
while their sullen threshing would be heard even in those vinewebbed thickets where the little ground-bird can scarcely make
its way. The very caverns of the earth were no protection to
the parricides from its presence; for scarcely would they think
they had found a refuge in some sparry cell, when, poised midway between the ceiling and the floor, they would behold the
Flying Head glaring upon them. Sleeping or waking, the mon80THE FLYING HEAD.
ster was ever near; they paused to rest, but the rushing of its
wings, as it swept around their resting-place in never-ending
circles, prevented them from finding forgetfulness in repose; or
if, in spite of those blighting pinions that ever fanned them,
fatigue did at moments plunge them in uneasy slumbers, the
glances of the Flying Head would pierce their very eyelids, and
steep their dreams in horror.
What was the ultimate fate of that band of parricides, no
one has ever known. Some say that the Master of Life kept
them always young, in order that their capability of suffering
might never wear out; and these insist that the Flying Head
is still pursuing them over the great prairies of the far-west.
Others aver that the glances of the Flying Head turned each
of them gradually into stone; and these say that their fo:rms,
though altered by the wearing of the rains in the lapse of long
years, may still be recognized in those upright rocks whicl
stand like human figures along the shores of some of the neighboring lakes; though most Indians have another way of accounting for these figures. Certain it is, however, that the
Flying Head always comes back to this part of the country
about the times of the equinox; and some say even that you
may always hear the flapping of its wings whenever such a
storm as that we have just weathered is brewing,
Liberty and Prerogative.-w     EBSTER.
THE contest for ages has been to rescue liberty from the
grasp of executive power. Whoever has engaged in her sacred
cause, from the days of the downfall of those great aristocracies
which had stood between the king and the people to the time
of our own independence, has struggled for the accomplishment
of that single object. On the long list of the champions of human freedom, there is not one name dimmed by the reproach of
advocating the extension of executive authority; on the contrary, the uniform and steady purpose. of all such champions
has been to limit and restrainf it. To this end the spirit of liberty, growing more and more enlightened, and more and more
vigorous from  age to.age, has been battering for centuries
against the solid butments of the feudal system. To this end,
all that could be gained from the imprudence, snatched from

the weakness, or wrung from  the necessities of crowned heads,
has been carefully gathered up, secured, and hoarded as the
rich treasures, the very jewels of liberty. To this end, popular
and representative right has kept up its warfare against prercgative with various success; sometimes writing the history of a
whole age in blood; sometimes witnessing the martyrdom of
Sidneys and Russells, often baffled and repulsed, but still gaining, oni the whole, and holding what it gained with a grasp
which nothing but the complete extinction of its own being
could compel it to relinquish. At length the great conquest
over executive power, in the leading westelrn states of Europe,
has been accomplished.   The feudal system, like other stupendous fabrics of past ages, is known only by the rubbish which it
has left behind it.  Crowned heads have been compelled to
submit to the restraints of law, and the PEOPLE, with that intelligence and that spirit which make their voice resistless, have
been able to say to prerogative, "Thus far shalt thou come,
and no farther." I need hardly say, sir, that, into the full enjoyment of all which Europe has reached only through such
slow and painful steps, we sprang at once, by the declaration of
independence and by the establishment of firee representative
governments; government borrowing more or less from       the
models of other free states, but strengthened, secured, improved in their symmetry, and deepened in their foundation by
those great men of our own country, whose names will be as
familiar to future times as if they -were written on the arch of
the sky.
Antiquity of Freedom.-BRYANTr.
I-ERE are old trees, tall oaks and gnarled pines,
That stream with gray-green mosses; here the ground
Was never touched by spades, and flowers spring up
Unsown, and die ungathered. It is sweet
To linger here, among the flitting birds
And leaping squirrels, wandering brooks, and winds
That shake the leaves, and scatter as they pass
A fragrance from the cedars thickly set
With pale blue berries. In these peaceful shades--
Peaceful, unpruned, immeasurably oldMy thoughts go up the long dim path of years,
Back to the earliest days of Liberty.
82ANTIQUITY OF FREEDOM.
O FREEDOM1! thou art not, as poets dream,
A fair young girl, with light and delicate limbs,
And wavy tresses gushing from the cap
With which the Roman master crowned his slave,
When he took off the gyves. A bearded man,
Armed to the teeth, art thou: one mailed hand
Grasps the broad shield, and one the sword; thy brow
Glorious in beauty though it be, is scarred
With tokens of old wars; thy massive limbs
Are strong and struggling. Power at thee has launched
His bolts, and with his lightnings smitten thee;
They could not quench the life thou hast from Heaven.
Merciless Power has dug thy dungeon deep,
And his swart armorers, by a thousand fires,
Have forged thy chain; yet, while he deems thee bound,
The links are shiveried, and the prison walls
Fall outward; terribly thou springest forth,
As springs the flame above a burning pile,
And shoutest to the nations, who return
Thy shoutings, while the pale oppressor flies.
Thy birthright was not given by human hands.
Thou wert twin-born with man. In pleasant fields,
While yet our race was few, thou sat'st with him,
To tend the quiet flock and watch the stars,
And teach the reed to utter simple airs.
Thou by his side, amid the tangled wood,
Didst war upon the panther and the wolf,
Thine only foes: and thou with him didst draw
The earliest furrows on the mou,ntain side,
Soft with the Deluge. Tyranny himself,
Thy enemy, although of reverend look,
Hoary with many years, and far obeyed,
Is later born than thou; and as he meets
The grave defiance of thine elder eye,
The usurper trembles in his fastnesses.
Thou shalt wax stronger with the lapse of years,
But he shall fade into a feebler age;
Feebler, yet subtler. He shall weave his snares,
And spring them on thy careless steps, and clap
His withered hands, and from their ambush call
His hordes to fall upon thee. He shall send
Quaint maskers, forms of fair and gallant mien,
To catch thy gaze, and, uttering graceful words,
To charmn thy ear; while his sly imps, by stealth,
Twine round thee threads of steel, light thread on thread,
That grow to fetters; or bind down thy arms
With chains concealed in chaplets. Oh! not yet
May'st thou uilbrace thy corslet, or lay by
Thy sword! nor yet, 0, Freedom! close thy lids
In slumber; for thine enemy never sleeps;
And thou must watch and combat, till the day

Of the new Earth and Heaven. But wouldst thou rest
A while from tumult and the firauds of men,
These old and friendly solitudes invite
Thy visit. They, while yet the forest trees
Were young upon the inviolated Earth,
And yet the moss-stains on the rock were new,
Beheld thy glorious childhood, and rejoiced.

Wrr-H blackest moss the flower-plots
Were thickly crusted, one and all,
The rusted nails fell from the knots
That held the peach to the garden-wall.
The broken sheds looked sad and strange,
Unlifted was the clinking latch,
Weeded and worn the ancient thatch,
Upon the lonely moated grange.
She only said, " My life is dreary,
He cometh not," she said;
She said, "I am aweary, aweary;

Her tears fell with the dews at even;
Her tears fell ere the dews were dried;
She could not look on the sweet heaven,
Either at morn or eventide.
After the flitting of the bats,
When thickest dark did trance the sky,
She drew her casement-curtain by,
And glanced atlhwart the glooming fiats.
She only said, " The night is dreary,
He cometh not," she said;
She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!"
Upon the mliddle of the night,
Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:
The cock sung out an hour ere light:
From the dark fen the oxen's low
Came to her: without hope of change,
In sleep she seemed to walk forlorn,
Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed morn
About the lonely moated grange.
She only said, " The day is dreary,
He cometh not," she said;
She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!"
84MARIANA.
About a stone-cast from the wall
A sluice with blackened waters slept,
And o'er it many, round and small,
The clustered marish-mosses crept.
Hard by a poplar shook alway,
All silver-green with gnarled bark,
For leagues no other tree did dark
The level waste, the rounding gray.
She only said, "My life is dreary,
He cometh not," she said;
She said, " I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!"
And ever when the moon was low,
And the shrill winds were up and away,
In the white curtain, to and fro,
She saw the gusty shadow sway.
But when the moon was very low,
And wild winds bound within their cell
The shadow of the poplar fell
Upon her bed, across her brow.
She oply said, "The night is dreary,
He cometh not," she said;
She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!"
All day within the dreamy house,
The doors upon their hinges creaked,
The blue fly sung i' the pane; the mouse
Behind the mrouldering wainscot shrieked,
Or from the crevice peered about.
Old faces glimmered through the doors,
Old footsteps trod the upper floors,
Old voices called her from without.
She only said, "My life is dreary,
He cometh not," she said;
She said, " I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!"
The sparrow's chirrup on the roof,
The slow clock ticking, and the sound
Which to the wooing wind aloof
The poplar made, did all confound
Her sense; but most she loathed the hour
When the thick-moted sunbeam lay
Athwart the chambers, and the day
Was sloping toward his western bower.
Then, said she, "I am very dreary,
He will not come," she said;
She wept, "I am aweary, aweary

Steals o'er the ocean,
And with departed day
Hushed seems its motion.
Slowly o'er yon blue coast
Onward she's treading,

Hath found a pillow,
And the pale moonbeams sleep
On the green billow.
Bound by her emerald zone

And round her marble crown
Night winds are sighing.

Importance of Preserving           the Ulnion.-WEBSTER.
I PROFESS, sir, in my careei- hitherto to have kept steadily in
view the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the
preservation of our federal union. It is to that union we owe
our safety at home, and our consideration and dignity abroad.
It is to that union that we are chiefly indebted for whatevei
86ON PRESERVING THE UNION.
makes us most proud of our country. That union we reached
only by the discipline of our virtues, in the severe school of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities of disordered finance,
prostrate commerce, and ruined credit. Under its benign influences, these great interests immediately awoke, as from the
dead, and sprang forth with newness of life. Every year of its
duration has teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its blessings; and although our territory has stretched out wider and
wider, and our population spread farther and farther, they have
not outrun its protection, or its benefits. It has been to us all
a copious fountain of national, social, and personal happiness.
I have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the union, to
see what might lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have
not coolly weighed the chances of preserving liberty, when the
bonds that unite us together shall be broken asunder. I have
not accustomed myself to hang over the' precipice of disunion
to see whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the depth of
the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe counsellor in
the affairs of this government, whose.thoughts should be mainly bent on considering, not how the union should be best preserved, but how tolerable might be the condition of the people
when it shall be broken up and destroyed.
While the union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects spread out before us, for us and- our children. Beyond
that I seek not to penetrate the veil.  God grant that, in my
day at least, that curtain may not rise. God grant that on my
vision never may be opened what lies behind. When my eyes
shall be turned to behold, for the last time, the sun in heaven,
may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious union; on states dissevered, discordant,
belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may
be, in fraternal blood! Let their last feeble and lingering
glance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the republic, now
known and honored throughout the earth, still full high advanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their original lustre,
not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a single star obscuredbearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory as-What
is all this worth? Nor those other words of delusion and folly
-liberty first, and union afterward-but everywhere, spread
all. over in characters of living light, blazing on all its ample
folds as they float over the sea and over the land, and in every
wind under the whole heavens, that other sentiment dear to
every true American heart-libvstty and union, now and for
ever, one and inseparable!

Xvi'THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Freedom    and PatriotisrM.-OvILLE DEWEY.
GOD has stamped upon our very humanity this impress of
freedom. It is the unchartered prerogative of human nature. A
soul ceases to be a soul, in proportion as it ceases to be free.
Strip it of this, and you strip it of one of its essential and characteristic attributes. It is this that draws the footsteps of the
wild Indian to his wide and boundless desert-paths, and makes
him prefer them to the gay saloons and soft carpets of sumptuous palaces. It is this that makes it so difficult to bring him
within the pale of artificial civilization. Our roving tribes are
perishing-a sad and solemn sacrifice upon the altar of their
wild freedom. They come among us, and look with childish
wonder upon the perfection of our arts, and the splendor of our
habitations: they submnit with ennui and weariness, for a few
days, to our burdensome forms and restraints; and then turn
their faces to their forest homes, and resolve to push those
homes onward till they sink in the Pacific waves, rather than
not be free.
It is thus that every people is attached to its country, just in
proportion as it is free. I have seen my countrymen, and have
been with them a fellow wanderer, in othei lands; and little did
I see or feel to warrant the apprehension, sometimes expressed,
that foreign travel would weaken our patriotic attachments,
One sigh for home-home, arose from all hearts. And why,
from palaces and courts-why, from galleries of the arts, where
the marble softens into life, and painting sheds an almost living
presence of beauty around it-why, from the mountain's awful
brow, and the lovely valleys and lakes touched with the sunset
hues of old romance-why, from those venerable and touching
ruins to which our very heart grows-why, from all these scenes,
were they looking beyond the swellings of the Atlantic wave, to
a dearer and holier spot of earth-their own, own country.
Doubtless, it was, in part, because it is their country?  But it
was also, as every one's experience will testify, because they
knew that there was no oppression, no pitful exaction of petty
tyranny; because that there, they knew, was no accredited and
irresistible religious domination; because that there, they knew,
they should not meet the odious soldier at every corner, nor
swarms of imploring beggars, the victims of misrule; that there,
no curse causeless did fall, and no blight, worse than plague and
pestilence, did descend amidst the pure dews of heaven; because, in fine, that there, they knew, was liberty-upon all the
88NEED OF A NATIONAL LITERATURE.
green hills, and amidst all the peaceful valleys-liberty, the wall
of fire around the humblest home; the crown of glory, studded
with her ever-blazing stars upon the proudest mansion!
My friends, upon our own homes that blessing rests, that
guardian care and glorious crown; and when we return to those
homes, and so long as we dwell in them-so long as no oppressor's foot invades their thresholds, let us bless them, and
hallow them as the homes of freedom! Let us make them,
too, the homes of a nobler freedom-of freedom from  vice,
from evil, from passion-from  every corrupting bondage of the
soul.
Need of a National Literature.-w        rrIPPLE.
IN order that America may take its due rank in the commonwealth of nations, a literature is needed which shall be the
exponent of its higher life. We live in times of turbulence and
change. There is a general dissatisfaction, *manifesting itself
often in rude contests and ruder speech, with the gulf which
separates principles from actions. Men are struggling to realize dim ideals of right and truth, and each failure adds to the,
desperate earnestness of their efforts.' Beneath all the shrewdness and selfishness of the American character, there is a
smouldering enthusiasm which flames out at the first touch of
fire-sometimes at the hot and hasty words of party, and sometimes at the bidding of great thoughts and unselfish principles.
The heart of the nation is easily stirred to its depths; but those
who rouse its fiery impulses into action are often men compounded of ignorance and wickedness, and wholly unfitted to guide
the passions which they are able to excite. There is no country
in the world which has nobler ideas imbodied in more worthless
shapes. All our factions, fanaticisms, reforms, parties, creeds,
ridiculous or dangerous though they often appear, are founded
on some aspiration or reality which deserves a better form and
expression. There is a mighty power in great speech. If the
sources of what we call our fooleries and faults were rightly addressed, they would echo more majestic and kindling truths.
We want a poetry which shall speak in clear, loud tones to the
people; a poetry which shall make us more in love with our native
land, by converting its ennobling scenery into the images of
soTHIIE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
lofty thoughts; which shall give visible form and life to the
abstract ideas of our written constitutions; which shall confer
upon virtue all the strength of principle and all the energy of
passion; which shall disentangle freedom from cant and senseless hyperbole, and render it a thing of such loveliness and
grandeur as to justify all self-sacrifice; which shall make us
love man by the new consecrations it sheds on his life and destiny; which shall force through the thin partitions of conventionalism  and expediency; vindicate the majesty of reason;
give new  pqwer to the voice of conscience, and new vitality to
human affection; soften and elevate passion; guide enthusiasm
in a right direction; and speak out in the high language of men
to a nation of men.
The Eagle.-PERCIVAL.
BinD of the broad and sweeping wing,
Thy home is high in beaven,
Where -wide the storms their banners fling,
And the tempest clouds are driven.
Thy throne is on the mountain top;
Thy fields, the boundless air;
And hoary peaks, that proudly prop
The skies, thy dwellings are.
Thou sittest like a thing of light,
Amid the noontide blaze:
The midway sun is clear and bright;
It cannot dim thy gaze.
Thy pinions, to the rushing blast,
O'er the bursting billow, spread,
Where the vessel plunges, hurry past,
Like an angel of the dead.
Thou art perched aloft on the beetling crag,
And the waves are white below,
And on, with a haste that cannot lag,
They rush in an endless flow.
Again thou hast plumed thy wing for flight
To lands beyond the sea,
And away, like a spirit wreathed in light,
Thou burriest, wild and free.
Thou hurriest over the myriad waves,
And thou leavest them all behind;
Thou sweepest that place of unknown graves,
Fleet as the tempest wind.
90THE EAGLE.
When the night storm gathers dim and dark,
With a shrill and boding scream,
Thou rushest by the foundering bark,
Quick as a passing dream.
Lord of the boundless realm of air,
In thy imperial name,
The hearts of the bold and ardent dare
The dangerous path of fame.
Beneath the shade of thy golden wings,
The Roman legions bore,
Fromt the river of Egypt's cloudy springs
Their pride, to the polar shore.
For thee they fought, for thee they fell,
And their oath was on thee laid,
To thee the clarions raised their swell,
And the dying warrior prayed.
Thou wert, through an age of death and fears,
The image of pride and power,
Till the gathered rage of a thousand years
Burst forth in one awful hour.
And then a deluge of wrath it came,
And the nations shook with dread;
And it swept the earth till its fields were flame,
And piled with the mingled dead.
Kings were rolled in the wasteful flood,
With the low and crouching slave;
And together lay, in a shroud of blood,
The coward and the brave.
And where was then thy fearless flight?
" O'er the dark, mysterious sea,
To the lands that caught the setting light,
The cradle of Liberty.
There, on the silent and lonely shore,
For ages, I watched alone,
Anid the world, in its darkness, asked no mnore
Where the glorious bird had flown.
But then came a bold and hardy few,
And they breasted the unknown wave;
I caught afar the wandering crew;
And I knew they were high and brave.
I wheeled around the welcome bark,
As it sought the desolate shore,
And up to heaven, like a joyous lark,
My quivering pinions bore.
And now that bold and hardy few
Are a nation wide and strong;
And danger and doubt I have led them through,.And they worship me in song;:1THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTION IST.
And over their bright and glancing arms,
On field, and lake, and sea,
With an eye that fires, and a spell that charms,
I guide them to victory."
The Leper.-N. P. WmLIs.
" ROOM for the leper! Room!" And, as he came,
The cry passed on-" Room for the leper! Room I"
Sunrise was slanting on the city gates
Rosy and beautiful, and from the hills
The early risen poor were coming in,
Duly and cheerfully to their toil, and up
Rose the sharp hammer's clink, and the far hum
Of moving wheels and multitudes astir,
And all that in a city murmur swellsUnheard but by the watcher's weary ear,
Aching with night's dull silence, or the sick
Hailing the welcome light and sounds that chase
The death-like images of the dark away.
"Room for the leper!" And aside they stoodMatron, and child, and pitiless manhood-all
Who met him on his way-and let him pass.
And onward through the open gate he came,
A leper with the ashes on his brow,
Sackcloth about his loins, and on his lip
A covering, stepping painfully and sloW,
And with a difficult utterance, like one
Whose heart is with an iron nerve put down,
Crying, " Unclean! Unclean!"'Twas now the first
Of the Judean autumn, and the leaves,
Whose shadows lay so still upon his path,
Had put their beauty forth beneath the eye
Of Judah's loftiest noble. He was young,
And eminently beautiful, and life
Mantled in eloquent fulness on his lip,
And sparkled in his glance; and in his mien
There was a gracious pride that every eye
Followed with benisons-and this was he I
With the soft airs of summer, there had come
A torpor on his frame, which not the speed
Of his best barb, nor music, nor the blast
Of the bold huntsman's horn, nor aught that stirs
The spirit to its bent, might drive away.
The blood beat not as wont within his veins;
Dimness crept o'er his eye; a drowsy sloth
92THE LEPER.
Fettered his limbs like palsy, and his mien,
With all its loftiness, seemed struck with eld.
Even his voice was changed-a languid moan
Taking the place of the clear silver kevy;
And brain and sense grew faint, as if the light
And very air were steeped in sluggishness.
He strove with it a while, as manhood will,
Ever too proud for weakness, till the rein
Slackened within his grasp, and in its poise
The arrowyjereed like an aspen shook.
Day after day, he lay as if in sleep.
His skin grew dry and bloodless, and white scales,
Circled with livid purple, covered him,
-And Helon was a leper!"
Day was breaking,
When at the altar of the temple stood
The holy priest of God. The incense lamp
Burned with a struggling light, and a low chant
Swelled through the hollow arches of the roof
Like an articulate wail, and there, alone,
Wasted to ghastly thinness, Helon knelt.
The echoes of the melancholy strain
Died in the distant aisles, and he rose up,
Struggling with weakness, and bowed down his head
Unto the sprinkled ashes, and put off
His costly raiment for the leper's garb;
And with the sackcloth round him, and his lip
Hid in a loathsome covering, stood still,
Waiting to hear his doom:
Depart! depart, 0 child
Of Israel, from the temple of thy God!
For he has smote thee with his chastening rod;
And to the desert-wild,
From all thou lov'st, away thy feet must flee,
That from thy plague His people may be free.
Depart! and come not near
The busy mart, the crowded city, more;
Nor set thy foot a human threshold o'er;
And stay thou not to hear
Yoices that call thee in tlhe way; and fly
From all who in the wilderness pass by.
Wet not thy burning lip
In streams that to a human dwelling glide;
Nor rest thee where the covert fountains hide,
Nor kneel thee down to dip
The water where the pilgrim bends to drink,
By desert well or river's grassy brink;
And pass thou not between
The weary traveller and the cooling breeze;
And lie not down to sleep beneath the trees
93THE 7RACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Where human tracks are seen;
Nor milk the goat that browseth on the plain,
Nor pluck the standing corn, or yellow grain.
And now depart! and when
Thy heart is heavy, and thine eyes are dimin
Lift up thy prayer beseechingly to Him
Who, from the tribes of men,
Selected thee to feel His chastening rod.
Depart! 0 leper! and forget not God!
And he went forth-alone! not one of all
The many whom he loved, nor she whose name
Was woven in the fibres of the heart
Breaking within him now, to come and speak
Comfort unto him. Yea-he went his way,
Sick, and heart-broken, and alone-to die!
For God had cursed the leper!
It was noon,
And Helon knelt beside a stagnant pool
In the lone wilderness, and bathed his brow,
Hot with the burning leprosy, and touched
The loathsome water to his fevered lips,
Praying that he might be so blest-to die!
Footsteps approached, and, with no strength to flee,
He drew the covering closer on his lip,
Crying, "Unclean! unclean!" and in the folds
Of the coarse sackcloth shrouding up his face,
He fell upon the earth till they should pass.
Nearer the Stranger cane, and bending o'er
The leper's prostrate form, pronounced his name"Helon!" The voice was like the master-tone
Of a rich instrument--most strangely sweet;
And the dull pulses of disease awoke,
And for a moment beat beneath the hot
And leprous scales with a restoring thrill.
" Helon! arise!" and he forgot his curse,
And rose and stood before Him.
Love and awe
Mingled in the regard of Helon's eye
As he beheld the Stranger. He was not
In costly lraiment clad, nor on his brow
The symbol of a princely lineage wore;
No followers at His back, nor in His hand
Buckler, or sword, or spear-yet in his mien,
Command sat throned serene, and if He smiled,
A kingly condescension graced His lips,
The lion would have crouched to in his lair.
His garb was simple, and His sandals worn;
His stature modelled with a perfect grace;
His countenance the impress of a God,
Touched with the opening innocence of a child;
94THE CRICKET ON THE HEARTHI
His eye was blue and calm, as is the sky
In the serenest noon; His hair unshorn
Fell to his shoulders; and His curling beard
The fulness of perfected manhood bore.
He looked on Helon earnestly awhile,
As if His heart were moved, and, stooping down,
He took a little water in His hand
And laid it on his brow, and said, "Be clean i"
And lo! the scales fell from him, and his blood
Coursed with delicious coolness through his veins,
And his dry palms grew moist, and on his brow
The dewy softness of an infant's stole.
His leprosy was cleansed, and he fell down
Prostrate at Jesus' feet and worshipped Him.
The Cricket on the Hearth.-       DcICENs.
TIiE Kettle began it! Don't tell me what Mrs. Peerybingle
said. I know better. Mrs. Peerybingle may leave it on record
to the end of time that she couldn't say which of them began
it; but I say the Kettle did. I ought to know, I hope! The
Kettle began it, full five minutes by the little waxy-faced Dutch
clock in the corner before the Cricket uttered a chirp.
As if the clock hadn't finished striking, and the convulsive little Haymaker at the top of it, jerking away right and left with
a scythe in front of a Moorish Palace, hadn't mowed down half
an acre of imaginary grass before the Cricket joined in at all!
Why, I am not naturally positive. Every one knows that.
I wouldn't set my own opinion against the opinion of Mrs.
Peerybingle, unless I were quite sure, on any account whatever.
Nothing should induce me. But this is a question of fact.
And the fact is, that the Kettle began it, at least five minutes
before the Cricket gave any sign of being in existence. Contradict me: and I'll say ten.
Let me narrate exactly how it happened. I should have
proceeded to do so in my very first word, but for this plain
consideration-if I am to tell a story I must begin at the beginning; and how is it possible to begin at the beginning without
beginning at the Kettle?
It appeared as if there were a sort of match, or trial of skill,
you must understand, between the Kettle and the Cricket.
And this is what led to it, and how it came about.
95THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
Mrs. Peerybingle going out into the raw twilight, and clicking
over the wet stones in a pair of pattens that worked innumerable
rough impressions of the first proposition in Euclid all about the
yard-Mrs. Peerybingle filled the Kettle at the water butt.
Presently returning, less the pattens: and a good deal less, for
they were tall and Mrs. Peerybingle was but short: sht, set the
Kettle on the fire. In doing which she lost her temper, or mislaid it for an instant; for the water-being uncomfortably cold,
and in that slippy, slushy sleety sort of state wherein it seems
to penetrate through every kind of substance, patten rings included-had laid hold of Mrs. Peerybingle's toes, and even
splashed her legs. *And when we rather plume ourselves (with
reason too) upon our legs, and keep ourselves particularly neat
in point of stockings, we find this, for the moment, hard to bear.
Besides, the  Kettle was aggravating and obstinate. It
wouldn't allow itself to be adjusted on the top bar; it wouldn't
hear of accommodating itself kindly to the knobs of coal; it
would lean forward with a drunken air, and dribble, a very idiot
of a Kettle, on the hearth. It was quarrelsome; and hissed and
spluttered morosely at the fire. To stun up all, the lid, resisting
Mrs. Peerybingle's fingers, first of all turned topsy-turvy, and
then, with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of a better cause,
dived sideways in-down to the very bottom of the Kettle. And
the hull of the Royal George has never made half the monstrous resistance to coming out of the water, which the lid of
that Kettle employed against Mrs. Peerybingle, before she got it
up again.
It looked sullen and pig-headed enough, even then; carrying
its handle with an air of defiance, and cocking its spout pertly
and mockingly at Mrs. Peerybingle, as if it said, " I wont boil.
Nothing shall induce me!"
But Mrs. Peerybingle, with restored good humor, dusted her
chubby little hands against each other, and sat down before
the Kettle: laughing. Meantime, the jolly blaze uprose and
fell, flashing and gleaming on the little Haymaker at the top of
the Dutch clock, until one might have thought he stood stock
still before the Moorish Palace, and nothing was in motion but
the flame.
He was on the move, however; and had his spasms, two to
the second, all right and regular. But his sufferings when the
clock was going to strike were frightful to behold; and when a
Cuckoo looked out of a trap-door in the Palace, and gave note
six times, it shook him, each time, like a spectral voice-or like
a something wiry, plucking at his legs.
96THE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH.                   97
It was not until a violent commotion and a whirring noise
among the weights and ropes below him had quite subsided,
that this terrified Haymaker became himself again. Nor was
he startled without reason; for these rattling, bony skeletons of
clocks are very disconcerting in their operations, and I wonder
very much how any set of men, but most of all how Dutchmen,
can have had a liking to invent them. For there is a popular
belief that Dutchmen love broad cases and much clothing for
their own lower selves; and they might know better than to
leave their clocks so very lank and unprotected, surely.
Now it was, you observe, that the Kettle began to spend the
evening. Now it was, that the Kettle, growing mellow and
musical, began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat, and
to indulge in short vocal snorts, which it checked in the bud,
as if it hadn't quite made up its mind yet, to be good company.
Now it was, that after two or three such vain attempts to stifle
its convivial sentiments, it threw off all moroseness, all reserve,
and burst into a stream of song so cosy and hilarious, as never
maudlin nightingale yet formed the least idea of.
So plain, too! Bless you, you might have understood it like
a book-better than some books you and I could name, perhaps.
With its warm breath gushing forth in a light cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a few feet, then hung about the
chimney-corner as its own domestic heaven, it trolled its song
with that strong energy of cheerfulness, that its iron body
hummed and stirred upon the fire; and the lid itself, the recently rebellious lid-such is the influence of a bright exampleperformed a sort of jig, and clattered like a deaf and dumb
young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother.
That this song of the Kettle's was a song of invitation and
welcome to somebody out of doors; to somebody at that moment coming on, towards the snug small home, and the crisp
fire, there is no doubt whatever. Mrs. Peerybingle knew it,
perfectly, as she sat musing, before the hearth. It's a dark
night, sang the Kettle, and the rotten leaves are lying by the
way; and above, all is mist and darkness, and below, all is mire
and clay; and there's only one relief in all the sad and murky
air; and I don't know that it is one, for it's nothing but a glare
of deep and angry crimson, where the sun and wind together
set a brand upon the clouds for being guilty of such weather;
and the widest open country is a long dull streak of black; and
there's hoar-frost on the finger-post, and thaw upon the track;
and the ice it isn't water, and the water isn't free; and you

couldn't say that anything is what it ought to be; but he's
coming, coming, coming!And here, if you like, the Cricket DID chime in! with a chirrup, chirrup, chirrup of such magnitude, by way of chorus;
with a voice so astoundingly disproportionate to its size as compared with the Kettle; (size! you couldn't see it!) that if it
had then and there burst itself like an overchariged gun; if it
had fallen a victim on the spot, and chirruped its little body
into fifty pieces; it would have seemed a natural and inevitable
consequence, for which it had expressly labored.
The Kettle had had the last of its solo performance. It persevered with undiminished ardor; but the Cricket took first
fiddle and kept it. Good Heaven, how it chirped! Its shrill,
sharp, piercing voi-ce resounded through the house, and seemed
to twinkle in the outer darkness like a star. There was an indescribable little trill and tremble in it, at its loudest, which
suggested its being carried off its legs, and made to leap again,
by its own intense enthusiasm. Yet they went very well together, the Cricket and the Kettle. The burden of the song
was still the same; and louder, louder, louder still, they sang
it in their emulation.
The fair little listener; for failr she was, and young-though
something of what is called the dumpling shape; but I don't
myself object to that-lighted a candle; glanced at the Haymaker on the top of the clock, who was getting in a pretty
average crop of minutes; and looked out of the window, where
she saw nothing, owing to the darkness, but her own face imaged in the glass. And my opinion is, (and so would yours
have been,) that she might have looked a long way, and seen
nothing half so agreeable. When she came back, and sat down
in her former seat, the Cricket and the Kettle were still keeping
it up with a perfect fury of competition. The Kettle's weak
side clearly being that he didn't know when he was beat.
There wvas all the excitement of a race about it. Chirp, chirp,
chirp!  Cricket a mile ahead.   Hum, hum, hum--m--m!
Kettle making play in the distance, like a great top. Chirp,
chirp, chirp! Cricket round the corner. Hum, hum, humm-m! Kettle sticking to him in his own way; no idea of
giving in.  Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cilicket fresher than ever.
Hum, hum, hum--m--   m! Kettle slow and steady. Chirp,
chirp, chirp! Cricket going' in to finish him. Hum, hum,
hum-m--m' lkettle not to be finished. Until at last, they
got so jumbled together, in the hurry-skurry, helter-skelter of

the match, that whether the Kettle chirped and the Cricket
hummed, or the Cricket chirped and the Kettle hummed, or
they both chirped and both hummed, it would have taken a
clearer head than yours or mine to decide with anything like
certainty.  But of this there is no doubt; that the Kettle and
the Cricket, at one and the same moment, and by some power
of amalgamation best known to themselves, sent each his fireside
song of comfort streaming into a ray of the candle that shone
out through the window, and a long way down the lane. And
this light, bursting on a certain person who, on the instant, approached towards it through the gloom, expressed the whole
thing to him, literally in a twinkling, and cried, " Welcome home,
old fellow! Welcome home, my boy!"
The Spirit of Poetry,-LONGFrELLoA.
THERE is a quiet spirit in these woods,
That dwvells wher'er the gentle south wind blows;
Where, underneath the wite-thorn, in the white-thor, i the glade,
The wild flowers bloom, or, kissing the soft air,
The leaves above their sunny paltns outspread.
With what a tender and impassioned voice
It fills the nice and delicate eai of thouglht,
When the fast-usherino star of morning comes
O'er-riding the gray hills -with golden scarf;
Or when the cowled and dusky-sandalled Eve,
In mourning weeds, fitom out the western gate,
Departs with silent pace! That spirit moves
In the green valley, where the silver brook,
From its full laver, pours the ilwhite cascade;
And, babbling low amid the tangled woods,
Slips down througlh moss-grown stones with endless laughter.
And frequent, on the everlasting hills,
Its feet go forth, when it doth wrap itself
In all the dark embroidery of the storm,
And shouts the stern, strong wind. And here, amid
The silent majesty of these deep woods,
Its presence shall uplift thy thoughts from earth,
As to the sunshine and the pure, bright air
Their tops the green trees lift. Hence gifted bards
Have ever loved the calm and quiet shades.
For them there was an eloquent voice in all
The sylvan pomp of woods, the golden sun,
The flowers, the leaves, the river on its way,
Blue skies, and silver clouds, and getitle windsThe swelling upland, where the sidelong sun

Aslant the wooded slope, at evening goesGroves, through whose broken roof the sky looks in,
iMountain, and shattered cliff, ald sunny vale,
The distant lake, fountains-and mighty trees,
In many a lazy.syllable, repeating
Their old poetic legends to the wind.
And this is the sweet spirit, that doth fill
The world; and, in these wayward days of youth,
My busy fancy oft embodies it,
As a bright image of the light and beauty
That dwell in nature-of the heavenly forms
We worship in our dreams, and the soft hues
That stain the wild bird's wing, and flush the clouds
When the sun sets. Within her eye
The heaven of April, with its changing light,
And when it wears the blue of May, is hung,
And on her lip the rich, red rose. Her hair
Is like the summer tresses of the trees,
When twilight makes them brown, and on her cheek
Blushes the richness of an autumn sky,
With ever-shifting beatity. Then her breath,
It is so like the gentle air of Spring,
As from the morning's dewy flowers, it comes
Full of their fragrance, that it is a joy
To have it round us-and her silver voice
Is the rich music of a summer bird,
Heard in the still nlight, with its passionate cadence.
The Murdoer.-R. H. DANA.
PAUL drew near the house and watched till the last light was
put out.--" The innocent and guilty both sleep, all but Paul!
Not even the grave will be a resting-place for me! They hunt
and drive me to the deed; and when'tis done, will snatch the
abhorred soul to fires and tortures.  Why should I rest more?
The bosom I slept sweetly on-blissful dreams stealing over me
-the bosom that to my delighted soul seemed all fond and
faithful-why,:what harbored in it?   Lust and deceit, and sly,
plotting thoughts, shoiwing love where they most loathed. They
stung me--ay, in my sleep, crept out upon me and stung me
-poisoned my very soul-hot, burning poisons! Peace, peace,
your promptings, Ye that put me to this deed-drive me not
mad! Am I not about it?"
He walked up cautiously to the door, and taking a key from
0 Dhis pocket unlocked it and went in. There was now a suspense
of all feeling in him. He entered the parlor. His wife's shawl
was hanging on the back of a chair; books in which he had
read to her were lying on the table, and her work-table near it
open. His eye passed over them, but there was no emotion.
He left the room and ascended the stairs with a slow, soft step,
stealing through his own house cautiously as a thief. He unlocked the door of his dressing-room, and passed on without
noticing any part of it. His hand shook as he partly opened
his wife's chamber-door.  He listened-all was still. He cast
his eye round, then entered and shut the door after him. He
walked up by the side of her bed without turning his. eyes toward it, and seated himself down upon it by her. Then it was
he dared to look on her, as she lay in all her beauty, wrapt in
a sleep so gentle he could not hear her breathing. She looked
as if an angel talked with her in her dreams. Her dark, glossy
hair had fallen over her bright, fair neck and bosom, and the
moonlight striking through it, pencilled it in beautiful thready
shadows on her.
Paul sat for a while with folded arms, looking down on her.
His eye moved not, and in his dark face was the unchanging
hardness of stone. His mind appeaned elsewhere. There was
no. longer feeling in him. He seemed waiting the order of some
stern power. The command at last came. He laid his hand
upon her heart and felt its regular beat; then drew the knife
from his bosom. Once more he laid his hand upon her heart;
then put the point there. He pressed his eyes close with one
hand, and the knife sunk to the handle. There was a convulsive start and a groan. He looked on her. A slight flutter
passed over her frame, and her filmy eyes opened on him once;
but he looked as senseless as the body that lay before him.
The moon shone fully on the corpse, and on him that sat by it;
and the silent night went on. By and by, up came the sun in
the hot flushed sky, and sent his rays over them. Paul moved
not, nor heeded the change. There was no noise nor motionthere were they two together, like two of the dead.
At last Esther's attendant, entering suddenly, saw the gloomy
figure of Paul before her. She ran out with a cry of terror,
and in a moment the room was filled with servants. The old
man came in trembling and weak; no tear was wrung from
him, nor a groan. He bowed his head as saying, It is done.
The alarm was given, and Frank, with the neighbors, went
up to the chamber. Though the room was nearly full, not a
sound was heard. The stillness seemed to spread from Paul
THIE MURDER.
101THE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
and the dead over them all. Frank and some others came near
him and stood before him; but he continued looking on his
wife, as he sat with his crossed hands resting on his thigh;
while the one which had done the murder still held the bloody
knife.
No one moved. At last they looked at each other, and one
of them took Paul by the wrist. He turned his slow, heavy
eye on them, as if asking who they were, and what they wanted. They instinctively shrunk back, letting go ther hold, and
his arm fell like a dead man's.
There was a movement near the door; and presently Abel
stood directly before Paul, his hands_ drawn between his knees,
his body distorted and writhing as with pain..... There was
a gleam and glitter, and something of a laugh and anguish, too,
in his crazed eye, as it flitted back and forth from Esther to
Paul. At last Paul glanced upon him. At the sight of Abel
he gave a shuddering start that shook the room. He looked
once more on his wife; his hair rose up, and his eyes became
wild. "Esther i" he gasped out, tossing up his arms as he
threw himself forward. He struck the bed and fell to the floor.
Abel looked and saw his face black with the rush of blood to
the head; then giving a leap at which he nearly touched the
ceiling, with a deafening shriek that rung through the house,
darted out of the chamber, and, at a spring, reached the outer
door.
They felt of Paul.-Life had left him.
Frank took the father from the room. Preparations were
hastily made; and about the close of the day Esther's body,
followed by a few neighbors and friends, was carried to the
grave. The grave-yard was not far from the foot of the stony
ridge. As they drew near it, the sun was just going down, and
the sky clear, and of a bright warm glow. Presently a figure
was seen running and darting in crossing movements along, the
top of the ridge, leaping from point to point more like a creature
of the air than of the earth, for it hardly seemed to touch on
any thing. It was mad Abel. So swift and shooting were his
motions, and so quickly did he leap and dance to and fro, that
it appeared to the dazzled eye as if there were hundreds holding
their hellish revels in the air; and now and then a wild laugh
reached the mourners, that seemed to come out from the still sky.
When it was night, the men who had made Paul's grave a little without the consecrated ground, came to the house, and
taking up the body moved off toward the place in which they
were to lay it.--No bell tolled for the departed; no one fol102lowed to mourn over him, as he was laid in the ground away
from man, or to hear the earth fall on his coffin-that sound
which makes us feel as if our living bodies, too, were crumbling
into dust.
It had been a chilly night; and while the frost was yet heavy
on the grass, some of the neighbors went to wonder and moralize over Paul's grave. There appeared something singular upon
it. They ventured timidly on, and found lying across it poor
Abel. He was apparently dead; and some of the boldest took
hold of him. He opened his eyes a little and uttered a faint,
weak cry. They dropped their hold; his limbs quivered and
stretched out rigid-then relaxed. His breath came once,
broken and quick--it was his last.
Niagara.-s. MARGARET FULLER.
WE have not been fortunate in weather, for there caninct be
too much, or too warm sunlight for this scene, and the skies
lhave been lowering with cold, unkind winds. My nerves, too
much braced up by such an atmosphere, do not well bear the
continual stress of sight and sound. For here there is no
escape from the weight of a perpetual creation; all other forms
and motions come and go, the tide rises and recedes, the wind,
at its mightiest, moves in gales and gusts; but here is really an
incessant, an indefatigable motion. Awake or asleep, there is
no escape, still this rushing round you and through you. It is
in this way I have most felt the grandeur-somewhat eternal,
if not infinite.
At times a secondary music rises; the cataract seems to seize
its own rhythm, and sing it over again, so that the ear and soul
are roused by a double vibration. This is some effect of the
wind, causing echoes to the thundering anthem. It is very sublime, giving the effect of a spiritual repetition through all the
spheres....
All great expression, which, on a superficial survey, seems so
easy as well as so simple, furnishes, after a while, to the faithful observer, its own standard by which to appreciate it. Daily
these proportions widened and towered more and more upon
my sight, and I got, at last, a proper foreground for these sublime distances. Before coming away, I think I really saw the
NIAGARA.
103TIIE PRACTICAL ELOCUTIONIST.
full wonder of the scene. After a while it so drew me into
itself as to inspire an undefined dread, such as I never knew before, such as may be felt when death is about to usher us into a
new existence. The perpetual trampling of the waters seized
my senses. I felt that no other sound, however near, could be
heard, and would start and look behind me for a foe. I realized the identity of that mood of nature in which these waters
were poured down with such absorbing force, with that in which
the Indian was shaped on the same soil. For continually upon
nmy mind came, unsought and unwelcome, images, such as never
haunted it before, of naked savages stealing behind me with
uplifted tomahawks; again and again this illusion recurred, and
even after I had thought it over, and tried to shake it off, I
could not help starting and looking behind me....
The rapids enchanted me far beyond what I expected; they
are so swift that they cease to seem so; you can think only of
their beauty. The fountain beyond the Moss Islands, I discovered for myself, and thought it for some time an accidental
beauty, which it would not do to leave, lest I might never see
it again. After I found it permanent, I returned many times to
watch the play of its crest. In the little waterfall beyond, Nature seems, as she often does, to have made a study for some
larger design. She delights in this-a sketch within a sketch,
a dream within a dream. Wherever we see it, the lines of the
great buttress in the fragment of stone, the hues of the waterfall, copied in the flowers that star its bordering mosses, we are
delighted; for all the lineaments become fluent, and we mould
the scene in congenial thought with its genius.....
As I rode up to the neighborhood of the falls, a solemn awe
imperceptibly stole over me, and the deep sound of the everhurrying rapids prepared my mind for the lofty emotions to be
experienced. When I reached the hotel, I felt a strange indifference about seeing the aspiration of my life's hopes. I
lounged about the rooms, read the stage bills upon the walls,
looked over the register, and, finding the name of an acquaintance, sent to see if he was still there. What this hesitation
arose from, I know not; perhaps it was a feeling of my unworthiness to enter this temple which nature has erected to its
God.
At last, slowly and thoughtfully I walked down to the bridge
leading to Goat Island, and when I stood upon this firail support, and saw a quarter of a mile of tumbling, rushing rapids,
and heard their everlasting roar, my emotions overpowered me,
a choking sensation rose to my throat, a thrill rushed through
104my veins, "my blood ran rippling to my finger's ends."  This
was the climax of the effect which the falls produced upon meneither the American nor the British fall moved me as did
these rapids. For the magnificence, the sublimity of the latter
I was prepared by descriptions and by paintings. When I arrived in sight of them I merely felt, "ah, yes, here is the fall,
just as I have seen it in picture." When I arrived at the terrapin bridge, I expected to be overwhelmed, to retire trembling
from this giddy eminence, and gaze with unlimited wonder and
awe upon the immense mass rolling on and on, but, somehow or
other, I thought only of comparing the effect on my mind with
what I had read and lieard. I looked for a short time, and then
with almost a feeling of disappointment, turned to go to the
other points of view to see if I was not mistaken in not feeling any surpassing emotion at this sight.  But from the foot
of Biddle's stairs, and the middle of the river, and from below the table rock, it was still "barren, barren all."  And,
provoked with my stupidity in feeling most moved in the wrong
place, I turned away to the hotel, determined to set off for
Buffalo that afternoon. But the stage did not go, and, after
nightfall, as there was a splendid moon, I went down to the
bridge, and leaned over the parapet, where the boiling rapids
came down in their might. It was grand, and it was also gorgeous; the yellow rays of the moon made the broken waves appear like auburn tresses twining around the black rocks. But they
did not inspire me as before. I felt a foreboding of a mightier
emotion to rise up and swallow all others, and I passed on to
the terrapin bridge.  Everything was changed, the misty apparition had taken off its many-colored crown which it had worn
by day, and a bow of silvery white spanned its summit. The
moonlight gave a poetical indefiniteness to the distant parts of
the waters, and while the rapids were glancing in her beams,
the river below the falls was black as night, save where the reflection of the sky gave it the appearance of a shield of blued
steel. No gaping tourists loitered, eyeing with their glasses, or
sketching on cards the hoary locks of the ancient river god.
All tended to harmonize with the natural grandeur of the
scene. I gazed long. I saw how helre mutability and unchangeableness were united. I surveyed the conspiring waters
rushing against the rocky ledge to overthrow it at one mad
plunge, till, like toppling ambition, o'erleaping themselves, they
fall on t'other side, expanding into foam ere they reach the
deep channel where they creep submissively away.
Then arose in my breast a genuine admiration, and an humble

Claims of Literature upon America.-A. H. EVERETT.
INDEPENDENCE and liberty, the great political objects of all
communities, have been secured to us by our glorious ancestors. In these respects, we are only required to preserve and
transmit unimpaired to our posterity the inheritance which our
fathers bequeathed to us. To the present and to the following
generations, is left the easier task of enriching, with arts and
letters, the proud fabric of our national glory. Our Sparta is
indeed a noble one. Let us then do our best for it.
Let me not, however, be understood to intimate that the pursuits of literature or the finer arts of life, have been, at any
period of our history, foreign to the people of this country.
The founders of the colonies, the Winthrops, the Smiths, the
Raleighs, the Penns, the Oglethorpes, were among the most
accomplished scholars and elegant writers, as well as the loftiest
and purest spirits of their time. Their successors have constantly sustained, in this respect, the high standard established
by the founders. Education and Religion-the two great cares
of intellectual and civilized men-were always with them the
foremost objects of attention. The principal statesmen of the
Revolution were persons of high literary cultivation; their public documents were declared, by Lord Chatham, to be equal to
the finest specimens of Greek and Roman wisdom. In every
generation, our country has contributed its full proportion of
eminent writers.
In this respect, then, our fathers did their part; our friends
of the present generation are doing theirs, and doing it well.
But thus far the relative position of England and the United
States has been such that our proportional contribution to the
common literature was naturally a small one. England, by her
great superiority in wealth and population, was of course the
head-quarters of science and learning. All this is rapidly

changing. You are lready touching the point when your
wealth and population will equal those of England. The superior rapidity of your p oDgress will, at no distant period, give you
the ascendency. It w 11 then belong to your position to take
the lead in arts and letters, as in policy, and to give the tone to
the literature of the language. Let it be your care and study
not to show yourselves unequal to this high calling-to vindicate the honor of the new world in this generous and friendly
competition with the old. You wili perhaps be told that literary
pursuits will disqualify you for the active business of life. Heed
not the idle assertion. Reject it as a mere imagination, inconsistent with principle, unsupported by experience. Point out
to those who make it, the illustrious characters who have reaped
in every age the highest honors of studious and active exertion.
Show them Demosthenes, forging by the light of the midnight
lamp those thunderbolts of eloquence, which
"Shook the arsenal and fulmined over GreeceTo Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne.
Ask then if Cicero would have been hailed with rapture as the
father of his country, if he had not been its pride and pattern
in philosophy and letters. Inquire whether C.esar, or Frederick, or Bonaparte, or Wellington, or Washington, fought the
worse because they knew how to write their own commentaries.
Remind them of Franklin, tearing at the same time the lightning
from heaven, and the sceptre from the hands of the oppressor.
Do they say to you that study will lead you to skepticism?
Recall to their memory the venerable names of Bacon, Milton,
Newton, and Locke. Would they persuade you that devotion
to learning will withdraw your steps from the paths of pleasure?
Tell them they are mistaken. Tell them that the only true
pleasures are those which result from the diligent exercise of
all the faculties of body, and mind, and heart, in pursuit of noble ends by noble means. Repeat -to them the ancient apologue
of the youthful Hercules, in the pride of strength and beauty,
giving up his generous soul to the worship of virtue. Tell
them your choice is also made. Tell them, with the. illustrious
Rloman orator, you would rather be in the wrong with Plato,
than in the right with Epicurus. Tell them that a mother in
Sparta would have rather seen her son brought home from battle a corpse upon his shield, than dishonored by its loss. Tell
them that your mother is America, your battle the warfare of
life, your shield the breastplate of Religion.
