HEALTH.
My dear ( ),

The moumful intelligence of your
illness has just roaclmd mo; and could you witness
the uneasiness which I endure upon your account,
you would readily unclerstzmd how warmly I sym-
pathize in your sufferings. That they will be but
temporary, I need scarcely say is my earnest wish ;
and that they will be so, I have every reason to
hope, from the nature of your nzalruly, and the
youthful strength of your constitution. My in-
quiries rolativo to your progress toward recovery
will be very frequent; perhaps even wearisome to
your attendants; but how can I be otherwise than
constantly anxious, while sensible of the sufferings
which you endure ? How rejoiced I shall be when
you find yourself well enough, and sufﬁciently
strong, to write a few lines to

Your over sincere and aﬂbcltionate friend.

A GENTLEMAN TO A LADY, COMPLAININGL OF HER
COOLNESS.

Dear ( ),

How often have I passed my late
conduct in review before me, endeavoring to dis-
cover by what word, or by what not, I could have
given you offence. Vain, however, has been the
attempt ; for the oiTence which I have given must
have been inadvertent, and could not have sprung
from any intention to have given you even a mo-
menfs uneasiness. But that, by some means, I
have had the misfortune to excite your displeas-

’ me, has been but too evident, as indicated in the

change of your behavior toward me--a chaiigﬁ
from the kindness of an attached friend, to the cool
indifference of a distant acquaintance. Of late,
when in your presence, I have been many time:
upon the point of asking upon what occasion, and
by what means, I have made myself disgraeiotmnin
yen: eyes. But as constantly have I needed the

Dear ( ),

How often do I think of those inno-
cent and happy days when much of our time was
passed together! Servitude has since separated
us ; but if I may judge of your heart by my own,
our feelings of affection toward each other‘ have
not undergone the slightest change. Our attach-
ment is the same, and we must both long for that
period when, freed from servitude, the useful toils
of our past life may meet their reward--a reward
to consist in our union, and a comfortable settle-
ment in some honest calling. You will be happy
to hear that my present situation is one of much
comfort: I have a kind and considerate master and
mistress, my wages are sufficient to enable me to
save half of them, which I very regularly place in
the savings‘ bank; my duties are not oppreaﬁve.
and a liberal board is provided for the servanm

They can not, however, prevent me from ecrib-

him to. The dangers which I have experienced
since we last parted have indeed been very numer-

membered only to be rehearsed at some future
time, before the Christmas hearth, when fortune
shall again restore me to the domestic circle.

FOR HIMSELF AND WIFE.

Sir,

I beg you will indulge me with your

forgiveness for the liberty which I take in thus

troubling you with a letter; but as my name is
probably familiar to you, from my having been a
tenant of one of your forms some years since, I
have persuaded myself that I am not without some
claim, at least, upon your notice. On relinquish-
ing the tenancy of your farm, my circumstances
were far from being prosperous, and they have
since been gradually, though rapidly, declining,
till I find myself, at present, with my wife and two
children, without the comfort of a settled abode,
and dependant entirely upon casual labor, or the
triﬂing aid. of a relative or friend who has little to
spare from the ntunerotls exigencies of his own
family. I have thought it probable that you may
have some small farm at present uotenanted, but
into which you might wish to place a tenant, or a
person to manage it, so that it might afford you a
proﬁtable return, instead of lying waste and unpro-
ductive. In such a capacity, I flatter myself from
the extensive experience which I have had in farm-
ing, I could make myself of real service and value,
while my wife, who from an early period of her

life has been chieﬂy employed in the duties of the

allowed to solicit employment from you, or your
interest with another, in obtaining such employ»

have taken in sending this letter; but my belief that
you will receive it without offence, has emboldened
me to write. You have condescended, upon many
occasions, to notice my family, in consequence of
which I have cherished a hope that you are not in-
different to their welfare. My eldest daughter
(Jane) has now arrived at that age in which she
may be of some service in society, and may thus,
by her industry, relieve her parents from the ex-
pense of her maintenance. She has received a

My dear Father (er Mmher),

Thuuglx I needed not a token to re-
call you to memory, and to makemne leave you
better than I aver ham done, yet the hzmdsome
present which you have just sent me, has occa-

56 mm GI-:NTLEMEN'S mam-noox

good plain education, though she can not boast of
accomplishments; and my wife informs me that
she is clever at her needle, apt at instruction in her
domestic duties, and always alert in the perform-
ance of them; to which I may add, from my own
observation, that she is steady in her conduct, and
cheerful and eccomrnodnting in her disposition.
Having said this, you will be prepared to hear that
my object in addressing you is, to request that if
you should hear of any situation suitable to her
humble sphere and very moderate pretensions, you
will condescend to interest yourself in her favor;
and again entreating your kind indulgence for the
liberty I have taken in writing this letter, I beg to
subscribe myself,

Sir,

My friend_(Mr. ), whose name
you have probably not forgotten-—eince he informs
me that he has consulted you upon several occa-
sions, and having received much beneﬁt from your
advice--has recommended me to write to you,

or Lnrmn-wnzrxxo. 61

with a statement of the symptoms under which I
suffer. I have been under the treatment of coun-
try practitioners for some time, but the obstinate
nature of my complaint has hitherto baﬂled all
their skill ; and I have now no hope of relief loft,
except by application to some physician whose pro-
fessional reputation is of the highest rank : I therefore
address myself to you, and without further pre-»
amble will proceed at once to state the symptoms
of my complaint. (Here the writer will enter into
the particulars to which he had referred.) After
what I have said, you will be well aware of the
bodily pain and the mental anxiety under which I
suffer, and will therefore, I trust, avail yourself of
the first ‘opportunity of favoring me with your pre-
scription, and the instructions requisite for my fu-
ture proceedings. Excuse me for sending you the
enclosed order upon the post-oﬂice for the sum of

Understanding that there is a vacancy

notice, with a view of obtaining that appointment.
In doing so, I would beg to state that I have been
employed, during the greater part of my life, either
on mtrsery—gruut1(ls or gentlemen’s gardens, and
have had mucl1 experience in the care and man-

For my character, as to ability and steadiness of
conduct, I can refer, with conﬁdence, to the follow-
ing geutleulen, in whose service I have lived, as
well as to the following nursery and scedsmen.
(Here mention the names and addresses of the
parties referred to.) The last gentleman with
whom I lived was Mr. ( ) ; I retained the
situation during (three) years, and have reason to
believe that he will speak favorably of me. I am

without incurnbrance), and my age is ( ).

tion, a letter would find me, addressed, (Here write

Sir,

My friend Mr. ( ), whom you
may remember as having had some dealings with
you, has expressed himself so well satisﬁed with
the purchases he has made at your repository (or
bazaar), that I am induced to rely upon your rec-
ommendation in the choice of a horse. I am in
want of a good strong hackney for ordinary riding,
and as I occasionally indulge myself in following
the hounds, he should also be equal to that duty:

although you must understand that Ido not re-
quire a professed hunter. The price must be ex-
tremely moderate, and I need scarcely add, that
you must warrant the animal to be free from vice.
If you have a horse of this description, you may

easy, not exceeding ( ); and I would call
upon you myself, were it not for some affairs which

Sir,

In obedience to the request contained
in your letter (of the 25th instant), I have de-
epatched one of my trustiest men with a ﬁne young
animal, late the property of ( ), who parted
with him on account of having ocoasibn to dimin-

at once struck with the excellence of his points,
and the beauty of his symmetry. He is ( )
high, is rising four years, and was warranted sound
and free from vice. The warrantry to that effect
I have in my possession, and I should be happy to
renew it on completing a sale. I have myself
ridden the animal, have tried his paces, and found
that his character, both for speed and endurance,
had not been overrated. His price would be (3 ),
and should you be pleased with him, and disposed
to make him your own, I would save you the
trouble of calling upon me, by riding over to your
house at any time to-marrow, or next day, accord-
ing to your convenience, which you could signify
by letter, to be conveyed by the man.

My dear ( ),

I can impose upon myself but few
tasks which are more coixgeniztl than that of con-
gmtttlatiug, avalued friend upon a change of life
which promiaes to ixzcrease her share of happiness.
I have just perused your kind letter, in which you
infarm me that you have lately entered into the
marriage state. ‘Be assured, my dear ( ), that
to this intelligence I give my warmest and most
sincere welcome. May that state to which you are
transferred be attended by each connubial blessing:
may you be happy in it, even as happy as you
dwenve, who are so instmtnental in making others
happy. On this subject, which is so interesting to
all who know you,I have more to say than the

A WIDOW, IN ANSWER TO PROPOSALS.

Dear Sir,

I take the first opportunity of ac-
knowledging the receipt of the ﬂattering letter with
which you have favored me. You are desirous to
know whether I am willing to enter again into the
marriage state, and in event of my being so, wheth-
er I should be averse to admitting you in the qual-
ity ofn suiter. I assure you, sir, I feel much ﬂat-
tered by the latter question ; and as to the former,
I can only say, that, from past experience of a wed-
ded life, Ihave no dislike to entering again into
that state. But our acquaintance is at present im-
perfect, and we are mutually strangers to the tastes
and tempers of each other. 1 need scarcely ob-
serve that an intimate knowledge upon these head!

I may hope that the subject of the present com-

Prior to the receipt of your letter,
which now lies befure me, I had suspected from

WltN3l)t:V{?1‘ we have latterly met in ccmipany, that
you wished our acquaintance should a9:su.me a

your letter, that I was not mistaken, and that you
wish our acquaintance to be carried to the extent
of permitting you formally to pay your addresses.
In the Silmi’: spirit of frankmrss with which you
have written upon this subject, I will freely admit,
that, {min what oppommities I have had of seeing
you, and of conversing with you, and from what I
have lmard of the repute you are held in by all who

feeling of aversion. As far, Lherefure, as my own
peruxission extemled, I should not object to receiv-

not take witlmut the appx'oba.:.ion and consent of
my parents, to whom I intend to communicate the
purport of your letter, and from whom, I doubt
not, you will shortly receive a conclusive answer.

INTRODUCTION.

IF letter-writing can be called an art, as it
sometimes is, it is an art reducible to at very
few rules, and those of the simplest nature.
The object which the writer should chieﬂy
have in View is, that of expressing his wants
or sentiments with a. perspicuity which can not
be mistaken, and in a style of language becom-
ing to the subject, and always to the point or
purport of the letter.

A redundancy, therefore, of ideas and lan-
guage, may be regarded as a blemieh, unless
the letters are written for display, or are meant
to meet the public eye through the medium of
the press.

\Vriters whose letters have been of the latter
class, have graced their effusions with “tropes

position to which I aspire---tlxat of your attached
and lawful wife. On that day our mutual protesta-
tions of affection and constancy were to lmve been
ratified before the altar; but those protestations, as
you will agree with me, have been made in sin-
cerity, and are too sterling to admit of any change
by a brief delay. From this observation, you will
be at once aware that a postponement of our nup-
tials is in contemplation. Such is the fact. Cer-
tain events lmve taken place, in consequence of
which. I regret to inform you that our union must
be postponed to a more distant day. I have con-
sulted with my relatives, and we have thought of

it has not been without 21 very close scrutiny into
his moral character, his temper, tastes, ideas, and

his partner in the wedded state. His disposition
is always cheerful. I know him to be a man of

hitherto found, that we seldom fail to coincide in
our opinions; which shows. at least, that we are
actuated by the same tastes. I have, therefore,
every reasonable prospect of enjoying happiness in

M y dear ( ),

In imagining what your thoughts and

only to call to recollection what my own have been
on a like occasion, when you, dear ( ), have
been absent from home. How has my remem-
brance of you been then interwoven in each minute
of my existence! and how have I counted each
lagging hour, till that had arrived which brought
me intelligence of your welfare! So justly do I
appreciate your attachment, that I feel convinced
this feeling must be mutual, and I picture to my-
self the smile of delight with which you will re-
ceive my present letter. 1 know you will experi-
ence 8. real satisfaction in hearing that I still enjoy
my health, and, in fact, was never better; and that
the hospitality and kindly attentions of ( ), so
far from diminishing, seem rather to increase.
They make it, indeed, their constant study to sur-
round me with comforts, and are perpetually de-
vising some fresh plans which they think may con-
dnce to my amusement. Be assured, therefore,
my dear( ), that, with the exception of mis~
Iing your cheering company and that of our chil-

do so, did not the pursuits of Mr. ( ) conﬁne

not at present of such a pressing nature as to force
me to decline your friendly lnvltatton; and Mr.

absenting myself from home for a short time, has
urged me to send you an affirmative answer: as he
thinks that, in addition to the enjoyment which I
can not fail to experience in the society of yourself
and your amiable family, I shall beneﬁt my health
by 21 change of air, as well as of scene. I am of
his opinion. and I think also that the early and
simple habits of the country, so widely different
from those of New York, will also contribute to
that effect. I therefore accept your kind invita-

temporary sojourn in your cheerful circle is likely
to be attended with such advantages to,

Dear Madam,

I have received from my frionr.l Mrs.

the behavior and accomplisliments of your former
pupils, the Misses ( ), that I lmvo come to

your charge. II€i\‘Il)§,?', however, a variety of en-

my power to call upon you at present, but I send
my children under good protection, with :1 conﬁ«
dent belief that you will give the strangers an on-
coumging reception. The olclr.-r of the two has
been to school before, but the yottriger has received
no irrsitrttction hot what I have been able to afford
her myself (or what she has received from :1 mm-
sery governess). I liove had an opportunity of
reading your prospectus, of which I approve, and
I think that your terms are for from being unrea-
sonable. But as I do not wish to incur needless
expenses, it is not my intention that my daughters
should avail themselves of all the accomplishments
which I ﬁnd enumerated in it. In addition to their
English education, I shall have no objection to
their looming French, as also the pizmoforte; and

treatment of my two daughters. I am sure that
you will afford them the requisite conveniences,
and all smelt comforts as they can reasonably ex~

end of which I had become accustomed to the
homely fare and the busy duties of a schoul, as
also to the company of my new associates, my
playmates and fellow-students, whose behavior, at

As you are now emancipated from my

may possibly be of some service to you whenever
you remember that they came from me. I know
that you are possossocl of good common sense,
and this must be your compass in your voyage
through life: and ever attentive to this guideylet
it serve to direct you in all your actions. The
knowledge gained from others, and your own ex-
perience, must teach you how to shun the hidden
rocks and quicksamls ; and many there are, which
lie deeply hidden beneath a most plausible and den
ceptive surface. Listen not to ﬂattery ; trust not to
bare professions; endeavor to penetrate another’s
motives, by tracing them to the source from which
they usually spring»-that of sellladvantage. Let it
be your endeavor, and constantly so, to enrich
yourself by every available means; but let those
means be strictly honest, for dishonorable lucre
sits heavily on the c.onscience, and, in a worldly
point of view, is ordinarily found to be very hard
to keep.

Be cautious in your companionship, for future
enemies usually arise from those with whom we
have been most intimate. You have hitherto been
temperate in your habits and enjoyments: be still
the same ; for your own past experience will point
oﬂtithe advantage of your being so ; and again ad-

My dear ( ),

It is impossible, with our limited
knowledge, to foresee the vicissitudes of this life.
We know not what a daymay bring forth, good or
evil; the latter, as some have reason to lament,
more frequently predominating; among which
number, you, my dear sir, have too much cause to
rank yourself. F mm what I have said, you are
preparea to hear that I am no stranger to your
misfortunes. They have indeed reached my ear.
and in doing so, have awakened in my bosom a

sympathy for your sufferings). Inﬂuenced by this
feeling, and bearing in remembrance our formet
intimacy, I beg to offer you my pecuniary assist-
ance, in the shape ofa loan, if you choose to call
it so, to be rohnhursed at your convenience, or sine
die ; in other words, not at all.

\Vith the enclosed ( ), accept my wishes
that by your exertions the wheel of fortune may
again revolve in your favor, and that I may short»
ly hear of your being reinstated in your former
prosperity,
