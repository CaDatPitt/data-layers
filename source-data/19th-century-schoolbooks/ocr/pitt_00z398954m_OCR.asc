lceep up an intercourse with the Deity, yetour inells»
nations are such, that we are more desirous of being“
conversant with those of our own species, to Wllumg
at all tsitnes, we we be able to unhosona ourselves.

Friendship is as oltl as the ﬁrst formation ofsoeietyg

and there is not one anegient writer now extant, who I

has not said sometlting in praise of it. Of this we
lmve a line example in the story of David and JOUQ.-3
than, as recorded in the second book of Samuel. In
the same sacred oracles we are told that love is -estrous
get’ tlmn death ; and even the great Redeemer of the
‘world haul a. beloved disciple.

But this cannot be suppeseé of‘ any reason-able erea:-=

The. reason of this common separation -between

edness. .The latter becomes predominant, and ‘thus

we are seduced and corrupted; our knowledge be-=’

comes of no avail, and our lives are rendered a scene
.ot'inconsistency between our principles and our con-
duct. The knowledge of our duty is given us on pure
pose that we may do it. ‘ Practice‘ is ‘all, and it signi~
ﬁes little what we know,  this is wanting.’ No in»
tellectual talents or accomplishments are of any ser-=
vice tothose who possess‘ them, unless they render
them better than other m_en. It is the subserviency
of wit and learning to -virtue that makes them indeed
ornaments and-blessings. Knowledge that is not at»
tended with correspondent practice, defeats its own in.
tentio-n. It becomes maimed, vain, and unprofitable.
We may shine, and make a great noise, but _we are

‘ still destitute of’ all real worth. One e;ood:(lis~position

in the soulis infinitely pref'erable.to the ﬁnest parts,
_or the most brilliant wit. One virtue in the heart is

more yaluable than a million of truths ﬂoating; in the

head, or any, even the most excellent arts and sciena»
ices with which the understanding can be stocked.

VVe are too apt to‘ be dazzled with the lustre of‘

» I knew a gentleman, who was so good a maizogee
otlais time, that he would not lose even that small.
portion of it, which the -calls of nature obliged himto
puss in the necessary house ; but g:°ai(luo.lly went
throiiglx all the Latin ytnets in those moments. He
bought, for example, a common edition of Horace, of
which he tore,_\oll'gra.duully a couple of gages, carriezi
them with him to that necessary ploee, read thens
first, and then sent them down as a sacrifice. to Clean
oino. This was so much time fairly gained ; and it
recomuoexzd his example. It is better than only (l0l!’lg"
what you ‘cannot lielpiatthose moments ; and it wilt

’ make any ‘boolgwhich you shallreatl in that maunei‘,

very present in your mind. . Books of science and‘ of
a grove sort, must be read witil continuity ; but there
are very many, antleven very useful ones, which may
heiifeoel with advantage by snatches ; and such are
all the good Latin poets, except‘Virg;il. in his Eueiil ;
such are most of the motlernpoets, in which you will;

‘the too many numerous persons to your own’.-=--===’

You may remem-her when-’ you consulted me on
the occasion, that E thought youth on both skies to be
no objection. indeed, from the mai~ria'g,ges« that have
i'7ai3‘e‘n under my oeservation, 1 am » rather ineiined to
think, that eariyones stand the best chance of”happi-
nees. Tiietemper anei habits of the young have not

‘yet become so etii'i'and- uneo1n~piyit':g, as when more

advaneeetin life; they form more eaeiiy to eae-heather’;
and hence manyoee.~asions‘oi' -ciiegiist are remover}.-‘em
And if youthhas lessee-f that prudence which is ne-

eeseary to xnanage a faniiiy, yet‘ the:parents andeelder .

friends of young married persons“ are geiieraily at
hand to oﬁer their advice, which ampiy snppiies that.
defect ; anal by early marriage, youth is sooner form»
ed to reguiar life; and possihiy some of tinoee acci-=
dents or connections, that might have injured the cone’
stitntion, or repn.tatio‘n o1‘botii, are -thereby happily prem

vented. Partieuiar circumstances of partieniar persons,

iniesy pos%=sibly?so:11etimes snake it prueient tweleiay enter;
ing into that state; but in general, when Nature has

rendered’ our bodies fit for it, ti1e‘ptTeSiiti1pti0i1 is in4Na«*
