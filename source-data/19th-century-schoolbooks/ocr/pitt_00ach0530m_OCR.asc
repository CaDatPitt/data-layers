THE widely extended approval and patronage bestowed upon the
Eclectic Educational Series for several years past, have given to them
- constantly increasing demand.
Their sale is NOT EQUALED by any other similar School
Books in the United States.
Such approval renders it the duty and PRIVILEGE of the Publishers to sustain and increase their usefulness by such improvements as are demanded by judicious educational progress. With
that view,
McGUFFEY'S ECLECTIC READERS
Have been entirely remodqled. Such lessons as discriminating
practical teachers had found the least interesting have been removed, and others, with large additions-especially of primary
matter-have been introduced into the series.
A careful attention to progression, by which the learner is led
forward, step by step, by an easy gradation - a pure moral and
religious sentiment inculcated in interesting and instructive lessons-a neat typography and handsome style of publication, render them the best class-books for reading in the English language;.and, at their very low prices, the cheapest.
J  To secure accuracy in those who order books, these volumes
(six in number), are entitled
MCGUFFEY'S NEW ECLECTIC READERS,
That they may not be confounded with the former editions, which
are still continued in publication.
Entered according to act of Congress, in the year Eighteen Hundred and

Stereotyped by C. F. O'Driscoll &amp; Co.which his decent mansion had formerly stood, his heart became more and more elated at every step he advanced. With
joy he proceeded, looking eagerly around; but he observed
few of the objects with which he had been formerly conversant. A magnificent edifice was erected on the site of the
house which he had inhabited'; the dwellings of his neighbors
had assumed a new form'; and he beheld not a single face
of which he had the least remembrance.
4. An aged beggar, who, with trembling limbs, stood at
the gate of an ancient portico, from which he had been thrust
by the insolent domestic who guarded it, struck his attention.
He stopped, therefore, to give him a small pittance out of the
amount of the bounty with which he had been supplied by
the emperor', and received, in return, the sad tidings, that
his wife had fallen a lingering sacrifice to penury and sorrow';
that his children were gone to seek their fortunes in distant
or unknown climes'; and that the grave contained his nearest
and most valued friends.
5. Overwhelmed with anguish, he hastened to the palace
of his sovereign, into whose presence his hoary locks and
mournful visage soon obtained admission'; and, casting himself at the feet of the emperor, "Great Prince"," he cried,
"send me back to that prison from which mistaken mercy has'delivered' me! I have survived my family and friends', and
even in the midst of this populous city, I find myself in a
dreary solitude. The cell of my dungeon protected me from
the gazers at my wretchedness'; and while secluded from
society, I was the less sensible of the loss of its enjoyments.
I am now tortured with the view of pleasure in which I can
not participate'; and die with thirst, though streams of delight surround' me."
XIX.  A HIGHLAND FEUD.
HIGHLANDS; the northern part of Scotland, so called because of
the mountainous character of that region.
1. A DEADLY feud subsisted, almost from time immemorial, between the families of Macpherson of Bendearg, and
Grant of Cairn', and was handed down unimpaired even to97
the close of the last century-. In the earlier times, the
warlike chiefs of these names found frequent opportunities
of testifying their mutual animosity"; and few inheritors of
the fatal quarrel left the world, without having moistened it
with the blood of some of their hereditary enemies. But,
in our own day, the progress of civilization, which had
reached even these wild countries, the heart of the North
Highlands, although it could not extinguish entirely the
transmitted spirit of revenge, at least kept it within safe
bounds'; and the feud of Macpherson and Grant threatened,
in the course of another generation, to die entirely away.
2. It was not, however, without some ebullitions of
ancient fierceness, that the flame, which had burned for
so many centuries, seemed about to expire. Once, at a
meeting of country gentlemen, on a question of privilege
arising, Bendearg took occasion- to throw out some taunts,
aimed at his hereditary foe, which the fiery Grant immediately received as a signal of defiance, and a challenge" was
the consequence.  The sheriff of the county, however,
having got intimation of the affair, put both parties under
arrest"; till at length, by the persuasion of their friends,nwot-friends by blood,-and the representations of the magistrate, they shook hands, and eachpledged"c himself to forget
the ancient feud of his family.
3. This occurrence, at the time, was the object of much
interest in the country-side'; the rather, that it seemed to
give the lie to the prophecies, of which every Highland
family has an ample stock in its traditionary chronicles, and
which expressly predicted, that the enmity of Cairn and
Bendearg should not be quenched but in blood. On the
seemingly cross-grained circumstance of their reconciliation,
some of the young men were seen to shake their heads, as
they reflected on the faith and tales of their ancestors'; but
the gray-headed seers shook theirs still vmore w,sely'-, and
answered with the motto of a noble house,--" I bide my
time."
4. There is a narrow pass between the mountains, in the
neighborhood of Bendearg, well known to the traveler who
adventures into these wilds, in quest of the savage sublimities of nature'. At a little distance, it has the appearance
9NEW SIXTH READER.
of an immense artificial bridge thrown over a tremendous
chasm, but, on nearer approach, is seen to be a wall of
nature's own masonry, formed of vast and rugged bodies of
solid rock, piled on each other as if in the giant sport of
the architect.  Its sides are, in some places, covered with
trees of a considerable size'; and the passenger, who has a
head steady enough to look down the precipice, may see the
aeries of birds of prey beneath his feet. The path-across is
so narrow, that it can not admit of two persons passing
alongside'; and, indeed, none but natives, accustomed to the
scene from infancy, would attempt the dangerous route at
all', though it saves a circuit of three miles. Yet it sometimes happens, that two travelers meet in the middle, owing
to the curve formed by the pass preventing a view from
either side', and, when this is the case, one is obliged to
lie down, while the other crawls over his body.
5. One day, shortly after the incident we have mentioned, a highlander was walking fearlessly along the pass;
sometimes bending over to watch the flight of wild birds that
built below-, and sometimes pushing a fragment from the
top, to see it dashed against the uneven sides, and bounding
from rock to rock, until the echo of its rebound diel in faint
and hollow murmurs at the bottom. When he had gained
the highest part of the arch, he observed another coming
leisurely up on the opposite' side, and being himself of the
patrician order, called out to him to halt and lie down. The
person, however, disregarded the comrmand', and the highlanders met, face to face, on the summit.
6. They were Grant and Macpherson"; the two hereditary
enemies, who would have gloried and rejoiced in mortal
strife with each other, on a hill-side. They turned deadly
pale at this fatal rencounter. " I was first at the top," said
Macpherson, "and called out first.  Lie down', that I may
pass over in peace'."  "When the Grant prostrates himself
before Macpherson," answered the other, "it must be with
the sword driven through his body."  "Turn back', then,"
said Macpherson, "and repass as you came."  "Go back
yourself', if you like it," repljed Grant; "I will not be the
first of my name to turn before the Macpherson."
7. This was their short conference&gt;, and the result ex99
actly as each had anticipated. They then threw their bonnets over the precipice', and advanced, with a slow and
cautious pace, closer to each other. They were both unarmed'; and, stretching their limbs like men preparing for
a desperate struggle, they planted their feet firmly on the
ground, compressed their lips, knit their dark brows, and,
fixing fierce and watchful eyes on each other, stood there,
prepared for the onset'.
8. They both grappled at the same moment'; but being of
equal strength, were unable for sometime to shift each other's
position, and remained standing fixed on a rock with suppressed breath, and muscles strained to the "top of their
bent," like statues carved out of the solid stone. I At length,
Macpherson, suddenly removing his right foot, so as to give
him a greater purchase, stooped his body, and bent his
enemy down with him by main strength, till they both
leaned over the precipice, looking downward into the terrible abyss. The contest was as yet doubtful', for Grant
had placed his foot firmly on an elevation at the brink,
and had equal command of his enemy'; but, at this moment, Macpherson sank slowly and firmly on his knee',
and while Grant suddenly started back, stooping to take the
supposed advantage, he whirled him over his head into the
gulf below. Macpherson himself fell backward, his body
hanging partly over the rock'; a fragment gave way beneath him, and he sank further, till, catching with a desperate effort at the solid stone above, he regained his footing.
9. There was a pause of death-like stillness, and the
bold heart of Macpherson felt sick and faint. At length, as
if compelled unwillingly by some mysterious feeling, he
looked down over the precipice. Grant had caught, with
a death-gripe, by the rugged point of a rock'; his enemy
was almost within his reach! his face was turned upward,
and there were in it horror and despair'; but he uttered no
word or cry. The next moment, he loosed his hold'; and the
next, his brains were dashed out before the eyes of his hereditary foe. The mangled body disappeared among the trees'.
and its last heavy and hollow sound arose from the bottom.
Macpherson returned home an altered man. He purchasedA
commission in the army, and fell in the wars of the Peninsul`XX.- THE HOUR OF PRAYER.
FROM MRS. HEIANS.
FELICIA HEMANS was born in Liverpool, England, in 1793, and educated in
Wales, that region of mountainous scenery. At the age of thirteen, her first
poems were published. At nineteen, she was married to Capt. Hemans, but
the union was unhappy, and they separated. She died at Dublin, at the
jhouse of her brother, in 183.5. Her poems are full of pathos, tenderness,
and beauty.
1. CHILD-, amid the flowers at play,
While the red light fades away';
Mother-, with thine earnest eye,
Ever following silently';
Father', by the breeze at eve
Call'd thy harvest work to leave';
Pray'! Ere yet the dark hours be,
Lift the heart, and bend the knee'.
2. Traveler", in the stranger's land,
Far from thine own household band';
Mourner", haunted by the tone
Of a voice from this world gone';
Captive-', in whose narrow cell
Sunshine hath not leave to dwell';
Sailor", on the darkening sea';
Lift the heart, and bend the knee.
3. Warrior', that from battle won,
Breathest now at set of sun';
Woman-', o'er the lowly slain,
Weeping on his burial plain';
Ye that triumph-', ye that sigh',
Kindred by one holy tie-';
Heaven's first star alike ye see',
Lift thie heart', and bend the knee'.
XXI.   PROSPECTS OF THE CHEROKEES.
In this lesson, the inflections belonging to interrogative sentences
may be noticed.
1. WHIITHER are the Cherokees to go'?  What are the
benefits' of the change?  What system' has been matured
for their security?  What laws-' for their government-?101
The~e questions are answered only by gilded promises in
general terms'; they are to become enlightened and civilized
husbandmen. They now live by the cultivation of the soil
and the mechanical arts. It is proposed to send them from
their cotton fields, their farms and their gardens, to a distant and unsubdued wilderness'; tonmake them tillers of the
earth'; to remove them from their looms, their workshops,
their printing-press, their schools and churches, near the
white settlements, to frowning forests', surrounded with
naked savages', that they may become enlightened and
civilized'!
2. We have pledged to them our protection'; and, instead of shielding them where they now are, within our
reach, under our own arm, we send these natives of a southern clime to northern regions, among fierce and warlike
barbarians. And what security do we propose to them?
A new guaranty! Who can look an Indian in the face, and
say' to him, "We and our fathers, for more than forty years,
have made to you the most solemn promises; we now violate
and trample upon them all'; but offer you in their steadanother' guaranty!"
3. Will they be in no danger of attack from the primitive inhabitants of the regions to which they emigrate'? How
can it be otherwise'? The official documents show us the
fact, that some of the few who have already gone, were involved in conflict with the native tribes, and compelled to a
second' removal.
4. How are they to subsist'?  Has not that country now
as great an Indian population as it can sustain-?  What has
become of the original' occupants? Have we not already
caused accession to their numbers, and been compressing
them more and more'? Is not the consequence inevitable,
that some must be stinted in the means of subsistence'?
Here too we have the, light of experience. By an official
communication from Governor Clark, the superintendent of
Indian affairs, we learn that the most powerful tribes, west of
the Mississippi, are, every year, so distressed by famine, thalt
many die for want of food. The scenes of their suffering are
hardly exceeded by the sieges of Jerusalem and Samaria.
There might be seen the miserable mother, in all the tortureswhich hunger could inflict, giving her last morsel for the
sustenance of her child, and then fainting, sinking, and
actually dying' of starvation!  And the orphan! no one
can spare it' food': it is put alive' into the grave of the
parent, which thus closes over the quick and the dead. And
this is not a solitary- instance only, "The living child is
often' buried with the dead mother."       /
5. I know, to what I expose' myself.  To feel any
solicitude for the fate of the Indians, may be ridiculed as
false philanthropy and morbid sensibility.  Others may
boldly say, "Their blood be upon us-,-" and sneer at scruples, as weakness unbecoming the stern character of a
politician.  If, in order to become a politician, it be necessary to divest the mind of the principles of good faith
and moral obligation, and harden the heart against every
touch of humanity, I confess that I am not-and by the
blessing of heaven, will never be-a politician.
6. We can not wholly silence the monitor within us.
It may not be heard amid the clashing of the arena'; in the
tempest and convulsions of political contentions'; but its
still small voice will speak to us, when we meditate alone at
even-tide'; in the silent watches of the night'; when we lie
down' and when we rise up', from a solitary pillow; and in
that dread hour, when,-" not what we have-done for ourselves', but what we have done for others'," will be our joy
and strength'; when, to have secured, even to a poor and
despised Indian', a spot of earth upon which to rest his
aching head; to have given him but a cup of cold water' in
charity', will be a greater treasure, than to have been the
conquerors of kingdoms, and lived in luxury upon the spoils.
REMARn.-It will be observed that the words "Indian" and
"water" in the last paragraph, receive the falling inflection as a
mark of emphasis. There is also, in the same paragraph, an example
of the inflections belonging to a series of members, and also.to antithesis, which subjects will be more particularly noticed hereafter.XXI[.  A POLITICAL PAUSE.
FROM THE SPEECHES OF FOX.
Fox was a celebrated English statesman. This is an extract from
a speech delivered during a truce in the war between England and
France.
In this lesson, the influence of a negative in determining the rising
inflection, is particularly noticeable.
1. " BUT we must pause'," says the honorable gentleman,
What'! must the bowels of Great Britain be torn out', her
best blood spilt', her treasures wasted', that you may make
an experiment'? Put yourselves',--O! that you would put
yourselves on the field of battle', and learn -to judge of the
sort of horrors you excite'. In former' wars, a man might,
at least, have some' feeling, some' interest, that served to
balance in his mind the impressions which a scene of carnage
and death must inflict'.
2. But if a man were present now at the field of slaughter,
and were to inquire for what they were fighting',--" Fighting'! "* would be the answer'; " they are not fighting'; they
are pausing'."  "Why is that man expiring'?  Why is that
other writhing with agony'?  What means this implacable
fury'?" The answer must be, "You are quite wrong, sir,
you deceive' yourself,--they are not fightinyg',-do not disturb' them,-they are merely pausing'! This man is not
expiring with agony',-that man is not dead',-he is only
pausing'! Bless you, sir, they are not angry-' with one
another; they have now no cause of quarrel; but their
country thinks that there should be a.pause'.  All that you
see is nothing like fighting',--there is no harm', nor cruelty',
nor bloodshed' in it; it is nothing more than a political
pause'!  It is, merely to try an experiment-to see whether
Bonaparte will not behave himself better' than heretofore;
and in the mean time, we have agreed to a pause', in pure
friendship!"
3. And is this the way that you are to show yourselves
the advocates of order'? You take up a system calculated
to uncivilize the world", to destroy order', to trample on
* Rule VIII.NEW SIXTH READER.
religion-, to stifle in the heart, not merely the generosity of
noble sentiment', but the affections of social nature; and in
the prosecution of this system, you spread terror and devastation all around' you.
REMARK.--The words "pause" and "pausing" may, perhaps, with
equal propriety, receive the falling circumflex.
XXIII. - SONG OF THE STARS.
FROM BRYANT.
WILLIAM CULLgN BRYANT was born in Cummington, Mass., in 1794, and
at an early age gave evidence of great precocity. His rank as a poet is
among the very first in our country. In 1825, he went to New York,
where he has since resided as editor of the New York Evening Post.
In the following lesson, the inflections characteristic of the imperative
mood and of exclamations are exemplified.
1. WHEN the radiant morn of creation broke,
And the world in the smile of God awoke,
And the empty realms of darkness and death
Were moved through their depths by his mighty breath',
And orbs of beauty, and spheres of flame,
From the void abyss, by myriads came,
In the joy of youth as they darted away',
Through the widening waste of space to play";
2. Their silver voices, in chorus rung;
And this was the song the bright ones sung'.
"Away', away'! through the wide, wide sky,
The fair blue fields that before us lie,
Each sun with the worlds that round us roll,
Each planet pois'd on her turning pole,
With her isles of green, and her clouds of white,
And her waters that lie, like fluid light.
3. "For the source of glory uncovers his face,
And the brightness o'erflows unbounded space',
And we drink, as we go, the luminous tides,
In our ruddy air and our blooming sides'.
Lo'! yonder the living splendors play';
Away', on our joyous path, away'!
4. "Look', look", through our glittering ranks afar,
In the infinite azure, star after star,
How they brighten and bloom as they swiftly pass'!105
How the verdure runs o'er each rolling mass'!
And the path of the gentle winds is seen,
Where the small waves dance, and the young woods lean'.
5. " And see'! where the brighter day-beams pour,
How the rainbows hang in the sunny shower';
And the morn and the eve with their pomp of hues,
Shift o'er the bright planets, and shed their dews';
And'twixt them both on the teeming ground,
With her shadowy cone, the night goes round'i
6. "Away'! away'! in our blossoming bowers,
In the soft air, wrapping these spheres of ours,
In the seas and fountains that shine with morn,
See', love is brooding, and life is born';
And breathing myriads are breaking from night,
To rejoice, like us, in motion and light'.
7. "Glide on', in your beauty, ye youthful spheres',
To weave the dance that measures the years.
Glide on', in glory and gladness sent
To the farthest wall of the firmament',
The boundless visible smile of Him,
To the vail of whose brow our lamps are dim."

THE FINAL JUDGMENT.
BEFORE that assembly every man's good' deeds will be
declared, and his most secret sins' disclosed. As no elevation of rank will then give a title to respect, no obscurity of
condition' shall exclude the just from public honor, or
screen the guilty from public shame'. Opulence will find
itself no longer powerful'; poverty will be no longer weak.'
Birth will no longer be distinguished'; meanness will no
longer pass unnoticed'.  The rich' and the poor will indeed
strangely mingle together; all the inequalities of the present
life shall disappear', and the conqueror' and his captive';
the monarch' and his subject'; the lord' and his vassal';
the statesman' and the peasant'; the philosopher' and the
unlettered hind"; shall find their distinctions to have been
mere illusions'.THIS book is presented to the public as the SIXTH in the remodeled
series of Eclectic Readers.
As it is designed for advanced pupils, most of the means adopted in
the other volumes for aiding the learner, such as Questions, Spelling,
&amp;c., are here dispensed with, and the student is left to his own
judgment.
The PRINCIPLES of ELOCUTION, in the introauctory article, are
explained and illustrated in a more extended, systematic, and complete
form, than in the preceding volumes.
The READING EXERCISES, as far as to page 204, are especially
adapted to illustrate the principles explained in the introductory
treatise. For example, the first five lessons are selected for their
especial adaptation to practice in Articulation, although it must be
borne in mind, that every word in every lesson is an exercise in
articulation.
The INFLECTIONS are illustrated, and a guide to their proper use
furnished, by an appropriate notation in most of the Reading Exercises as far as to the 73d, on page 204. Among them some are, also,
adapted to exemplify emphasis, some, the reading of poetry, and others,
are appropriate to practice in cultivating the voice, in its high, low, or
medium tones.
From the 74th Exercise onward, rhetorical notation is dispensed
with, the learner being left to his own judgment, except such aid as
the teacher may think proper occasionally to give, it being supposed
that, in the several volumes of this series, all, that could be proftably
contained in books, has been furnished.
7DRYDEN AND POPE.
Dryden knew more of man in his general nature', and
Pope in his local manners-. The notions of Dryden were
formed by comprehensive speculation', those of Pope by
minute attention'.  There is more dignity- in the knowledge
of Dryden', more certainty' in that of Pope'.  The style
of Dryden is capricious' and varied', that of Pope cautious'
and uniform-.  Dryden obeys' the motions of his own
mind; Pope constrains' his mind to his own rules of composition. Dryden's page is a natural field, rising into
inequalities', and diversified by the varied exuberance of
abundant vegetation'; Pope's is the velvet lawn&gt;, shaven by
the scythe, and leveled by the roller'-.  If the flights of
Dryden are higher', Pope continues longer- on the wing.
If, of Dryden's fire, the blaze is brighter-, of Pope's the
-heat is more regular- and constant'.  Dryden often surpasses' expectation, and Pope never falls below' it. Dryden
is read with frequent astonishment', and Pope with perpetual
delight-.

XXVI.- CHARACTER OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.
FROM PHILLIPS.
THIS is an extract from a speech delivered by Phillips, an Irish
lawyer of distinction, upon the character of Napoleon Bonaparte. It
is a good exercise on the inflections appropriate to antithesis and series.
BRAGANZA; reigning house of Portugal.
HlAPSBURG; reigning house of Austria.
DE STAEL; a celebrated French authoress, the daughter of Neckar.
KOTZEBUE; a distinguished German poet.
DAVID; a French painter of distinction.
1. HE is fallen"! We may now pause before that splendid
prodigy, which towered among us like some ancient ruin,
whose power terrified the glance its magnificence attracted.
Grand, gloomy", and peculiar', he sat upon the throne a
sceptered hermit, wrapt in the solitude of his own originality.
A mind', bold", independent", and decisive; a will', despotic
in its dictates'; an energy" that distanced expedition&gt;; and
a conscience', pliable to every touch of interest"', marked the109
outlines of this extraordinary character': the most extraordinary, perhaps, that in the annals of this world, ever rose',
or reigned', or fell'.
2. Flung into life, in the midst of a revolution that quickened every energy of a people who acknowledged no superior',
he commenced his course, a stranger by birth', and a scholar
by charity. With no friend but his sword, and no fortune
but his talents', he rushed into the list where rank, and wealth,
and genius' had arrayed' themselves, and competition fled
from him, as from the glance of destiny.
3. He knew no motive' but interest'; acknowledged no
criterion' but success'; he worshiped no God' but ambition',
and with an eastern devotion', he knelt at the shrine of his
idolatry'. Subsidiary to this, there was no creed' that he did
not profess', there was no opinion' that he did not promulgate': in the hope of a dynasty', he upheld the crescent; for
the sake of a divorce', he bowed before the cross'; the orphan
of St. Louis', he became the adopted child of the republic';
and with a parricidal ingratitude, on the ruins both of the
throne and the tribune', he reared the throne of his despotism.
A professed catholic', he imprisoned the Pope'; a pretended
patriot', he impoverished the country'; and in the name of
Brutus[, he grasped without remorse', and wore without
shame', the diadem of the Cesars.,
4. The whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity
of his designs', and the miracle of their execution. Skepticism bowed to the prodigies of his performance'; romance
assumed the air of history'; nor was there aught too incredible for belief', or too fanciful for expectation, when the
world saw a subaltern of Corsica' waving his imperial flag
over her most ancient capitals. All the visions of antiquity
became common-place in his contemplation': kings were his
people';&gt; nations were his out-posts'; and he disposed of
courts', and crowns&gt;, and camps', and churches', and cabinets', as if they were the titular dignitaries of the chessboard"'! Amid all these changes', he stood immutable as
adamant. It mattered little whether in the field', or in the
drawing-roorn'; with the mob', or the levee'; wearing the
jacobin bonnet', or the iron crown'; banishing a Braganza',
or espousing a Hapsburg'; dictating peace on a raft to theczar of Russia', or contemplating defeat at the gallows of
Leipsig'; he was still the'samne military despot'.
5. In this wonderful combination, his affectations of literature must not be omitted.  The jailer of the press', he
affected the patronage of letters'-; the proscriber of books', he
encouraged philosophy"; the persecutor of authors', and the
murderer of printers', he yet pretended to the protection of
learning'; the assassin of Palm', the silencer of De Stiiel',
and the denouncer of Kotzebue', he was the friend of David'-,
the benefactor of De Lille', and sent his academic prize to
the philosopher of England-.
6. Such a medley of contradictions', and, at the same
time, such an individual consistency-', were never united in
the same character'`.  A royalist'; a republican-' and an emperor'-; a Mohammedan'`; a catholic' and a patron of the
synagogue'-; a subaltern and a sovereign'-; a traitor-ffhd a
tyrant; a Christian and an infidel; he was, through all hiis
vicissitudes, the same stern, impatient, inflexible original';
the same mysterious, incomprehensible self'; the manl without
a model', and without a shadow'.
XXVII. - HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY.
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE was born at Stratford-on-Avon, in England, in
1564. He was the son of a wool-comber, and received some education at
a grammar school, though little is known with certainty of the incidents
of his life. He removed to London when about twenty-two years of age,
and rose to distinction through the success of his immortal dramas. He
died in 1616.
To be', or not' to be?  That is the question'-.
Whether't is nobler in the mind to suffer'
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune',
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And, by opposing', end'- them?  To die'-; to sleep';
Na mtore: and, by a sleep', to say we end
The heart-ache', and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to;'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die'; to sleep';
To sleep'! perchance to dr6am-Ay'-, there's the rub'-;For in that sleep of death what dreams may come',
When we have shuffled off this mortal coilP,
Must give us pause.  There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life';
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time-,
The oppressor's wrongs, the proud man's contumely',
The pangs of despised love-, the law's delay',
The insolence of office-, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes';
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin'?  Who would fardels bear,'To groan and sweat under a weary life',
But that the dread of something after' death,
That undiscover'd country' from whose bourne
No traveler returns', puzzles the will;
And makes us rather bear the ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all';
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sickli'd o'er with the pale cast of thought;
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
WTith this regard their currents turn awry',
And lose the name of action.
XXVIII. - ODE TO AN INFANT SON.
FROM THOMAS HOOD.
THOMAS HOOD was born in 1798. He is chiefly distinguished as a humorist a'nd' comic poet.  He was for a time the editor of the New Mo,thly
AlIagazine. " The Plea of the.Midsnmnmer.Fairies, "S'ong of the Shirt," and
" Whims and Oddities," are among his most popular prod-ctions. lie died
in 1845. He ranks first among English poets of his style.
The following lesson presents an example, in which the matter included
in the parenthesis, is disconnected with the main subject, and is, therefore,
subject to the general principles of inflection.
1.     THOU happy, happy elf'!
(But, stop', first let me kiss away that tear-,)
Thou tiny image of myself'!
(My love, he's poking peas into his ear',)
Thou merry, laughing sprite',
With spirits, feather light,
Untouch'd by sorrow, and unsoil'd by sin';
(My dear', the child is swallowing a pin'-!).2.    Thou little tricksy Puck'!
With antic toys so funnily bestuck,
Light as the singing bird that wings the air,(The door'! the door'! he'll tumble down the stair"!)
Thou darling of thy sire"!
(Why, Jane, he'11 set his pin-afore" afire!)
Thou imp of mirth and joy'!
In love's dear chain so bright a link,
Thou idol of thy parents';--(Hang' the boy I
There goes my ink'.)
3.    Thou cherub, but of earth';
Fit play-fellow for fairies, by moonlight pale,
In harmless sport and mirth',(That dog will bite' him, if he pulls his tailt!)
Thou human humming-bee", extracting honey
From every blossom in the world that blows,
Singing in youth's Elysium ever sunny",(Another tumble'!  That's his precious nose'!)
Thy father's pride and hope'!
(He'll break that mirror with that skipping-rope'!)
With pure heart newly stampt from nature's mint,(Where did he learn that squint'?)
4.    Thou young domestic dove'!
(He'll have that jug" off with another shove',)
Dear nursling of the hymeneal nest!
(Are these torn clothes his best?)
Little epitome of man!
(He'll climb upon the table', that's' his plan,)
Touch'd with the beauteous tints of dawning life',
(He's got a knife'!)
5.     Thou enviable being'!
No storms, no clouds, in thy blue sky foreseeing,
Play on', play on',
My elfin John'!
Toss' the light ball, bestride" the stick,(I knew" so many cakes would make him sick'!)
With fancies buoyant as the thistle-down,
Prompting the face grotesque, and antic brisk',
With many a lamb-like frisk!
(He's got the scissors, snipping at your gown'l!)
6.    Thou pretty opening rose'!
(Go to your mother', child', and wipe your nose'!)113
Balmy and breathing music like the south',
(He really brings my heart into my mouth'!)
Bold as the hawk', yet gentle as the dove';
(I'11 tell you what', my love',
I can not write, unless he's sent, above'.)
XXIX. - SPEECH OF WALPOLE IN REPROOF OF MR. PITT.
WILLIAM PITT, afterward EARL OF CHATHAM, and SIR ROBEIcT
WALPOLE, were distinguished English statesmen of the last century.
Pitt entered Parliament before he was twenty-one. At that time
Walpole was a leading politician, and as Pitt opposed his measures
with a force and eloquence seldonm equaled, he drew upon himself
the opposition of Walpole, as expressed in this extract, and which
Pitt answered in the succeeding extract with a vigor and eloquence
never surpassed.
In this and some succeeding lessons the emphatic words are
marked, in addition to the inflections.
1. I WAS unwilling to interrupt the course of this debate,
while it was carried on with calmness and decency, by men
who do not suffer the ardor of opposition to cloud their
reason, or transport them to such expressions as the dignity
of this assembly does not admit.
2. I have hitherto deferred answering the gentleman, who
declaimed against the bill with such fluency and rhetoric,
and such vehemence of gesture; who charged the advocates
for the expedients now proposed, with having no regard to
any interests but their own", and with making laws only to
consume paper', and threatened them with the deection of
their adherents, and the loss of their influence, upon this
new discovery of their folly and ignorance. Nor, do I now
answer him for any other purpose, than to remind him how
little the clamor of rage' and petulancy of invective, contribute
to the end for which this assembly is called together'; how
little the discovery of truth is promoted', and the security of
the nation established, by pompous diction and theatrical emotion.
3. Formidable sounds and fujrious declamation, confident
assertions' and lofty periods', may affect the young and inexperienced; and perhaps the gentleman may have contracted his
10NEW SIXTHI READER.
habits of oratory, by conversing more with those of his own
age, than with such as have more opportunities of acquiring
knowledge, and more successful methods of communicating
their sentiments. If the heat of temper would permit him to
attend to those, whose age and long acquaintance with business give them an indisputable right to deference and superiority, he would learn in time to reasons', rather than declaimnt;
and to prefer justness of argument and an accurate knowledge
of facts', to sounding epithets and splendid superlatives', which
may disturb the imagination for a moment, but leave no
lasting impression upon the mind. He would learn, that to
accuse' and prove' are very different"'; and that reproaches,
unsupported by evidence', affect only the character of him
that utters' them.
4. Excursions of fancy and flights of oratory', are indeed
pardonable in young" men, but in no other; and it would
surely contribute more, even to the purpose for which some
gentlemen appear to speak, (that of depreciating the conduct
of the administration'), to prove the inconveniences and injustice of this bill', than barely to assert' them, with whatever
magnificence of language", or appearance of zeal', honesty"' or
compassion".
XXX. - PITT'S REPLY TO SIR ROBERT WALPOLE.
See note at the head of the preceding Exercise.
(Observe in this, examples of antithesis and relative emphasis.)
1. TiE atrocious crime of being a young man, which the
honorable gentleman has, with such spirit and decency,
charged upon me, I shall neither attempt to palliate nor
deny'; but content myself with hoping, that I may be one
of those whose follies cease with their youth", and not of that
number, who are ignorant in spite of experience. Whether
youth' can he imputed to a man as a reproach', I will not
assume the province of determining'; but surely dge may
become justly  contemptible, if the opportunities which it
brings have passed away without improvement', and vice'
appears to prevail', when the passions' have subsided'.  The
wretch"', who, after having seen the consequences of a thousand errors, continues still to blunder', and whose age has
only added obstinacyy' to stupidify', is surely the object either
of abhorrence'. or contempt, and deserves not that his gray
hairs should secure him  from  insult.  Much more is he' to
be abhorred, who, as he has advanced'--in age', has receded'
-from virtue', and become more wicked'- with less temptation'; who prostitutes himself for money' which he can not
enjoy', and spends the remains of his life, in the ruin of his
country'.
2. But youth is not my only' crime; I am accused of acting a theatrical' part.  A  theatrical part may either imply
some peculiarity of gesture, or a dissimulation of my real sentiments', and an adoption of the opinions and language of
another' man. In the first sense, the charge is too trifliln
to be confuted'; and deserves only to be mentioned, that it
may be despised'. I' am  at liberty, like every other' man,
to use my own"' language; and though, perhaps, I may have
some ambition to please this gentleman, I shall not lay myself under any restraint, nor very solicitously copy his
diction or his mien', however matured by age', or modeled by
experience'.
3. But, if any man shall, by charging me with theatrical
behavior, imply, that I utter any sentiments but my own', I
shall treat him as a calumniator' and a villain'; nor shall
any protection' shelter him from the treatment he deserves.
I shall, on such an occasion, without scruple, trample' upon
all those forms with which wealth and dignity intrench
themselves, nor shall any thing but age' restrain my resentment'; ge, --which always brings one' privileg%, that of
being insolent and supercilious, without punishmentP.
4. But, with regard to those whom I have offended, I am
of opinion, that if I had' acted a borrowed part', I should
have avoided' their censure: the heat that ofended' them,
was the ardor of conviction', and that zeal' for the service
of my country' which neither hope' norfear shall influence me
to suppress-. I will not sit unconcerned' while my liberty is
invaded', nor look in silence' upon public robbery'.  I will
exert my endeavors, at whatever hazard, to repel the aggressor, and drag the thief to justice', whoever mayprotect him
in his villanies, and whoever may partake of his plunder.In the preparation of this work, free use has been made of the
writings of standard authors upon Elocution, such as Walker, McCulloch, Sheridan Knowles, Ewing, Pinnock, Scott, Bell, Graham, Mylins,
Wood, and many others.
In theaselection of articles for Reading Exercises, great care has
4een taken to present variety of style and subject, to attract by
interest of matter, to elevate by purity and delicacy of sentiment,
and especially to furnish the mind with valuable information, and to
influence the heart by sound moral and religious instruction.
Considerable liberty has been taken with the articles selected, in
order to adapt them to the especial purpose for which they are here
designed. Much change and remodeling have been necessary. The
lessons are therefore credited as taken "from" the author named.XXXI. - CHARACTER OF MR. PITT.
FROM ROBERTSON.
1. THE secretary stood alone. MIodern degeneracy had
not reached' him. Original and unaccommodating', the -features of his character had the hardihood of antiquity. His
august mind' overawed majesty itself. No state chicanery',
no narrow system of vicious politics', no idle contest for
ministerial victories', sank him to the vulgar level of the
great'; but overbearing', persuasive', and impracticable',
his object was England', his ambition was fame'.
2. Without dividing', he destroyed' party; without corru{pting', he made a venal age unanimous.  France sunk beneath' him.  With one' hand he smote the house of Bourbon, and wielded in the other-' the democracy of England.
The sight of his mind was infinite'; and his schemes were to
affect, not England&gt;', not the present' age only, but Europe"
and posterify. Wonderful were the means by which those
schemes were accomplished&gt;; always seasonable, always adequate,. the suggestion of an understanding animated by
ardor, and enlightened by prophecy.
3. The ordinary feelings which make life amiable and indolent were unknown' to him.  No domestic difficulties, no
domestic weakness' reached him; but aloof from the sordid
occurrences of life, and unsullied by its intercourse, he came
occasionally into our system, to counsel and decide.  A character so exalted', so strenuous', so various', so authoritative',
astonirshed"' a corrupt age, and the treasury trembled at the
name of Pitt, through all classes of venality.  Corruption
imagined, indeed, that she had found defects' in this statesman,
and talked much of the inconsistency of his glory&gt;, and much
of the ruin of his victories'; but the history of his country,
and the calamities of the enemy, answered and refuted" her.
4. Nor were his political his only' talents.  His eloquence
was an era' in the senate; peculiar, and spontaneous; familiarly expressing gigantic sentiments and instructive wisdom;
not like the torrent of Demosthenes, or the splendid conflagration of Tully; it resembled sometimes the thunder', and
sometimes the music' of the spheres.  He did not conduct
the understanding through the painful subtility of argumen117
tation, nor was he ever on the rack of exertion'; but rather
lightened- upon the subject, and reached the point by the
flashings of the mind, which, like those of the eye, were felt',
but could not be followed'.
5. Upon the whole, there was in this man something that
could create', subvert', or reform'; an  understanding, a
spirit&gt;, and an eloquence', to summon mankind to society, or
to break the bonds of slavery asunder, and to rule the wildness of free minds with unbounded authority; something that
could establish', or overwhelmr' empires, and strike a blow'
in the world that should resound through the universe'.
XXXII. - THE GOUTY MERCHANT AND THE STRANGER.
PUBLIC LEDGER; a noted newspaper in London.
King's Head; a tavern in London..
Newgate; a London prison.
1. IN Broadstreet building, (on a winter night),
Snug by his parlor-fire, a gouty wight
Sat all alone, with one hand rubbing
Ilis feet, rolled up in fleecy hose,
With t'other he'd beneath his nose
The Public Ledger', in whose columns grubbing,
He noted all the sales of hops'',
Ships', shops', and slops';
Gum', galls', and groceries'; ginger', gin',
Tar', tallow', turmeric', turpentine', and tin';
When lo'! a decent personage in black,
Enter'd and most politely said'2.    "Your footman, sir, has gone his nightly track
To the King's Head,
And left your door ajar', which I
Observ'd in passing by;
And thought it neighborly to give you notice'."
3.    " Ten thousand thanks'; how very few do get,
In time of danger,
Such kind attentions from a strangers!
Assuredly, that fellow's throat is
Doom'd to a final drop at Newgate':
He knowrs, too, (the unconscionable elf),
That there's no soul at home except myself`."NEW SIXTH READER.
4.    "Indeed," replied the stranger (looking grave),
" Then he's a double" knave;
He knows that rogues and thieves by scores
Nightly beset unguarded doors':
And see, how easily' might one
Of these domestic foes,
Even beneath your very nose,
Perform his knavish tricks';
Enter your room, as 1" have done,
Blow out your candles"--thus"-and thus"-,
Pocket your silver candlesticks"-,
And-walk off"--thus'""5. So said', so done'; he made no more remark,
Nor waited for replies,
But march'd off with his prize,
Leaving the gouty merchant in the dark.
XXXIII. - SPEECH BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION.
FROM PATRICK HENRY.
PATRICK HENRY was a distinguished American' statesman during
the Revolutionary war. He was a native of Virginia, held its highest
offices, and was a member of the convention which met to deliberate
upon uniting. with the other states in resistance to Great Britain.
Observe that the emphatic pause is freely used.
1. IT is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of
hope".  We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful trutli',
and listen to the song of that siren' till she transforms us
into beasts'.  Is this'--the part of wise men', engaged in a
great and arduous struggle for liberty'! Are we disposed to
be of the number of those', who, having eyes,-see not, and
having ears,-hear not the things which so nearly concern
*eir temporal salvation-?   For vmy"-part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost', I am willing to know the whole
truth; to know the worst', and to provide' for it.
2. I have but one lamp, by which my" feet are guided;
and that'--is-the lamp of experience. I know of no way
of judging of the future', but by the past'; and, judging by
the past', I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years', to justify
those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased tosolace themselves and the house'?  Is it that insidious smile'
with which our petition has been lately received'? Trust it
not: it will prove a snare' to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss'. Ask yourselves, how
this gracious reception of our petition, comports with those
warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our
land'. Are fleets'-and armies'--necessary to a work of
love and reconciliation'? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force'--must be called in to win:: back our love'?  Let us not deceive' ourselves.  These are
the implements of war' and subjugation'; the last arguments
to which kings resort,
3. I ask, gentlemen', what means this martial array, if
its purpose be not to force us into submission? Can gentlemen assign any other-possible-motive for it?  Has Great
Britain any enemy'--in this quarterof the world, to call for
all this accumulation of navies and armies'?  No', she
has none'. They are meant for us': they can,' be meant for
no other'.  They are sent over to bind' and rivet' upon us
those chains, which the British ministry have been so long
forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we
try argument?   We have been trying that, for the last
--ten-years. Have we any thing new' to offer upon the
subject?  Nothing'.  We have held the subject up in every
light in which it was capable'; but it has been all in vain.
4. Shall we resort to entreaty' and humble supplication'?
What terms' shall we find, which have not been already
exhausted'? Let us not, I beseech you, deceive ourselves
lqnger'.  We have done every' thing that could be done,
to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have
petitioned; we have remonstrated'; we have supplicated;
we have PROSTRATED" ourselves at the foot of the throw
and implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hai'
of the ministry and parliament. Our petitions" have been
slighted'; our remonstrances have produced additional violence
and insult'; our supplications', disregarded"; and we have
been spurned' with contempt' from the foot'of the throne.
5. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond
hope of peace and reconciliation.  There is no longer any
room,Y for hope. If we wish to be free; if we mean topreserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we
have been so long contending'; if we mean not basely to
abandonl' the noble struggle in which we have been so long
engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never" to
abandon, until the glorious object of our contest shall be
obtained"; we must.fight'! I repeat it', WE MUST FIGHT!!
An appeal to arms' and the God of Hosts, is all that is
left us.
6. They tell us, that we are weak7'; unable to  cope"
with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be,
stronger"'?  Will it be the next week", or the next year'?
Will it be, when we are totally disarmed, and when a British
guard shall be stationed in every house-?  Shall we gather
strength by irresolution and inaction'.? Shall we acquire the
means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs',
and hugging the delusive phantom of hope', until our enemies
shall have bound us hand and foot'!  We are not  weak,
if we make a proper use of those means', which the God of
nature hath placed in our power.
7. Three millions of people', armtd in the holy cause of
libert,y, and in such a country as that which we possess, are
invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.
Besides, we shall not fight our battles-alone'.  There is a
just God" who presides over the'destinies of nations;' and
who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The
battle, is not to the strong' alone; it is to the vigilant"
-the active--the brave'. Besides, we have no election. If
we were base enough to desire' it, it is now too late to
retire from the contest".  There is no- retreat but in sub-mission and slavery! Our chains are forged'.  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston-! The war is
iievitable-; and --let it come'!!  I repeat it, LET IT COME"!!'I. It is in vain to extenuate the matter". Gentlemen
may cry peace', peace'; but there is no' peace. The war is
actually begun". The next gale that sweeps from the north,
will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms"! Our
brethren" are already in the field!  Why stand we--here
idle? What is it that gentlemen wish"? What would they
have'?  Is life so dear', or peace so sweet", as to be purchased
at the price of chains' and slavery'?  Forbid it Alighty121
G6d! I know not what course others" may take; but as for
rme;, give me liberty', or GIVE ME DEATI-H.
REMARK. - In the above extract, may be found an illustration of
most of the principles of emphasis.
The most important emphatic words and pauses only are marked.
On this point there is always room for difference of opinion. Scarcely
any two persons would pronounce a sentence with precisely the same
emphasis. Observe, in the above lesson the all-controlling power of
emphasis in determining to the falling inflection. The words "see,"
tear," and "my," in the first paragraph, the word "that" in the
rcond, and "spurned" and "contempt" in the fourth paragraph, are
examples of this. Let the reader remember that a high degree of
emphasis is sometimes expressed by a whisper.
XXXIV - VANITY OF LIFE.
FROM HERDER'S HEBREW POETRY.
1. MAN, born of woman
Is of few days,
And full of trouble.
He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down';
He fleeth also as a shadow,
And continueth not.
2. Upon such dost thou open thine eye,
And bring me unto judgment with thee?
Among the impure is there one pure?
Not one'.
3. Are his days so determined'?
Hast thou numbered his months-,
And set fast his bounds for him,
Whlich he can never pass'?
Turn' then from him that he may rest'
And enjoy', as an hireling', his day".
4. The tree, hath hope', if it be cut down,
It becometh green' again,
And new shoots are put forth.
If even the root is old' in the earth,
And its stock die" in the ground,
From vapor of water it will bud,
And bring forth boughs as a young plant.
115. But man dieth, and his power is gone';
He is taken away, and where is he'.?
6. Till the waters waste from the sea,
Till the river faileth and is dry land,
Man lieth low, and riseth not again.
Till the heavens are old, he shall not awake,
Nor be aroused from his sleep.
7. Oh! that thou wouldst conceal me
In the realm of departed souls'I
Hide me in secret, till thy wrath be past';
Appoint me then a new term,
And remember me again..
But alas! if a man die.,
Slall he live' again?
8. So long, then, as my toil endureth',
Will I wait till a change' come to me.
Thou wilt call' me, and I shall answer';
Thou wilt pity the work of thy hands.
Though now thou numberest my steps',
Thou shalt then not watch for my sin.
My transgression will be sealed in a bags,
Thou wilt bind up and remove my iniquity.
9. Yet alas! the mountain falleth and is swallow'd ups,
The rock is removed out of its place',
The waters hollow out the stones',
The floods overflow the dust of the earth',
And thus, thou destroyest the hope of man.
10. Thou contendest with him, till he faileth'%,
Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
Though his sons become great' and happy',
Yet he knoweth it not;
If they come to shame' and dishonor',
He' perceiveth it not'.123
XXXV. -THE MARINER'S DREAM.
FROM  DIMOND.
IN this and some following Lessons, the principles applicable to the readIng of poetry are illustrated.
1. IN slumbers I of midnight 11 the Sailor-boy lay,
His hammock I swung loose 11 at the sport of the wind;
But watch-worn j and weary, II his cares I flew away,
And visions I of happiness 11 danced o'er his mind.
2. He dream'd of his home, II of his dear native bowers,
And pleasures that waited t1 on life's merry morn,
While Memory each scene jj gayly cover'd with flowers,
And restored every rose, 11 but secreted the thorn.
3. Then Fancy her magical pinions 11 spread wide,
And bade the young dreamer 11 in ecstasy rise;
Now, far, far behind him 1I the green waters glide,
And the cot of his forefathers 1I blesses his eyes,
4. The jessamine clambers 11 in flower o'er the thatch,
And the swallow sings sweet 11 from her nest in the wall;
All trembling with transport 1[ he raises the latch,
And the voices of lov'd ones 11 reply to his call.
5. A father bends o'er him 1I with looks of delight;
His cheek is impearl'd 1[ with a mother's warm tear;
And the lips of the boy I in a love-kiss unite
With the lips of the maid I whom his bosom holds dear.
6. The heart of the sleeper II beats high in his breast,
Joy quickens his pulse, 11 all his hardships seem o'er;
And a murmur of happiness 11 steals through his rest--
"0 God'! fhou hast blest me, 11 I ask for no more."
7. Ah! whence is that flame I1 which now bursts on his eye?
Ah! what is that sound I[ that now larums his ear?'Tis the lightning's red glare 1I painting hell on the sky!'Tis the crashing of thunders, II1 the groan of the sphere!
8. He springs' from his hammock, 11 he fies' to the deck;' Amazement confronts him fl with images dire;
Wild winds and mad waves [I drive the vessel a wreck,.   masts fly in splinters, l the sh:uds are on fire I9. Like mountains the billows 11 tumultuously swell,
In vain the lost wretch' j1 calls on mercy to save;
Unseen hands of spirits 11 are ringing his knell',
And the death-angel flaps 1I his broad wings o'er the wave.
10. Oh, Sailor-boy'! 1I woe to thy dream of delight!
In darkness I1 dissolves the gay frost-work of bliss;
Where now is the picture H1 that Fancy touch'd bright;
Thy parents' fond pressure, 11 and love's honey'd kiss?
11. Oh, Sailor-boy-'! Sailor-boy'! -   never again
Shall home, love, or kindred, 11 thy wishes repay;
Unbless'd and unhonor'd, 1H down deep in the main,
Full many a score fathom, Ij thy frame shall decay.
12. No tomb shall e'er plead 1H to remembrance for thee',
Or redeem form or fame J1 from the merciless surge;
But the white foam of waves 1I shall thy winding-sheet be,
And winds, in the midnight Il of winter, tily dirge.
13. On beds of green sea-flower ]] thy limbs shall be laid;
Around thy white bones II the red coral shall grow;
Of thy fair, yellow locks, 11 threads of amber be made',
And every part suit J1 to thy mansion below.
14. Days-', months-', years-', and ages", 11 shall circle away,
And still the vast waters 1I above thee shall roll;
Earth.loses thy pattern II forever and aye;
Oh, Sailor-boy-! Sailor-boy-! 1H peace to thy soul.
XXXVI. - THE SOLDIER'S REST.
FROM WALTER SCOTT.
SIR WALTER SCOTT was born at Edinburgh, in 1771. After his admission
the Scottish bar, he determined to devote himself to literary pursuits, and.s path to fame was opened by the:linstrelsy of the Scottish Border.
fter the publication of some original poems, he chose a new department of
literature, and, concealing. his name, commenced the series called the
Waverly Novels. He also produced several historical works. He died at

GESTURE...............
LESSONS IN PROSE.XXXVII. - BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.
BY CHARLES WOLFE.-.
REV. CHARLES WOLFE was a clergyman of the Church of England, who
died in early life, leaving but few specimens of his poetic talent. Byron
said of this ballad, that he would rather be the author of it than of any
one ever written.
1. NOT a drum I was heard, 11 not a funeral note,
As his corse 11 to the rampart we hurried;
Not a soldier I discharged 1 his farewell I shot
O'er the grave 11 where our hero was buried.
2. We buried him I darkly, 11 at dead I of night,
The sods' 11 with our bayonets I turning;
By the struggling moonbeam's 11 misty light,
And the lanterns 11 dimly burning.
3. No useless coffin" I enclosed I his breast,
Not in sheet I nor in shroud 11 we wound him;
But he lay like a warrior II taking his rest,
With his martial cloak around him.
4. Few and short-' [ were the prayers" we said,
And we spoke [[ not a word of sorrow;
And we steadfastly gazed 11 on the face of the dead,
And we bitterly thought 11 of the morrow.
5. We thought, 11 as we hollow'd his narrow bed,
And smooth'd down I1 his lonely pillow,
That thefoe"'  and the stranger" 11 would tread J o'er his head,
And we' I far away jj on the billQw.
6. Lightly I they'11 talk jj of the spirit I that's gone',
And o'er his cold ashes 11 upbraid" him,
But little he'1 reck, 11 if they'll let him sleep on
In the grave' 1I where a Briton has laid him.
7. But half I of our heavy task 1[ was done,
When the clock 1I struck the hour for retiring;
And we heard l[ the distant random gun
Which the foe 11 was sullenly firing.
8. Slowly and sadly II we laid him down,
From the field of his fame 1[ fresh and gory;
We carv'd not a line, 11 and we rais'd not a stone;
But left him 11 alone with his glory.XXXVIII. - MARY, THE MAID OF THE INN.
FROM SOUTHEY.
1. WHERE is she, the poor maniac, whose wildly-fix'd eyes
Seem a heart overcharged to express?
She weeps not', yet often and deeply she sighs;
She never complains; but her silence implies
The composure of settled distress.
2. No aid', no compassion-, the maniac will seek;
Cold and hunger' awake not her care;
Through the rags do the winds of the winter blow bleak
On her poor wither'd bosom, half bare'; and her cheek
Has the deadly pale hue of despair.'
3. Yet cheerful and happy', nor distant the day,
Poor Mary, the maniac, has been':
The traveler remembers, who journey'd this way,
No damsel so lovely', no damsel so gay',
As Mary, the Maid of the Inn.
4. Her cheerful address fill'd the guests with delight,
As she welcom'd them in with a smile;
Her heart was a stranger to childish affright,
And Mary would walk by the Abbey at night,
When the wind whistled down the dark aisle.
5. She lov'd'; and young Richard had settled the dayr;
And she hoped to be happy for life:
But Richard was idle and worthless; and they,
Who knew him, would pity poor Mary', and say,
That she was too good for his wife,
6.'T was in Autumn', and stormy and dark was the night,
And fast were the windows and door;
Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burn'd bright;
And, smoking in silence, with tranquil delight,
They listen'd to hear the wind roar.
7. "'T is pleasant," cried one, " seated by the fireside,
To hear the wind whistle without."
"A fine night for the Abbey-!" his comrade replied:
"Methinks a man's courage would now well be tried,
Who would wander the ruins about.8. I myself', like a school-boy, should tremble to hear
The hoarse ivy shake over my head;
And could fancy I saw, half persuaded by fear,
Some ugly old Abbot's white spirit' appear;
For this wind might awaken the dead."
9. "I'll wager a dinner," the other one cried,
"That Mary would ventuie there now': "
"Then wagers, and lose'," with a sneer he replied;
"I'11 warrant she'd fancy a ghost by her side,
And faint if she saw a white cow!"
10. " Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?"
His companion exclaim'd with a smile';
"I shall win', for I know she will venture there now,
And earn a new bonnet, by bringing a bough
From the alder that grows in the aisle."
11. With fearless good-humor did Mary comply&gt;,
And her way to the Abbey she bent;
The night it was gloomy', the wind it was high';
And, as hollowly howling it swept through the sky,
She shiver'd with cold as she went.
12. O'er the path so well known, still proceeded the maid,
Where the Abbey rose dim on the sight;
Through the gateway, she enter'd, she felt not afraid;
Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade
Seem'd to deepen the gloom of the night.
13. All around her was silent, save when the rude blast
Howl'd dismally round the old pile;
Over weed-cover'd fragments still fearless she pass'd,
And arrived at the innermost ruin at last,
Where the alder-tree grew in the aisle.
14. Well pleas'd did she reach' it, and quickly drew near,
And hastily gather'd the bough;
When the sound of a voice' seemed to rise on her ear;
She paus'd, and she listen'd, all eager to hear,
And her heart panted fearfully now!
15. The wind blew', the hoarse ivy shook over her head`:
She listen'd'; naught else could she hear.
The wind ceas'd', her heart sunk in her bosom with dread,
For she heard in the ruins-distinctly'-the tread
Of footsteps' approaching her near.16. Behind a wide column, half breathless with fear,
She crept, to conceal herself there;
That instant, the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,
And she saw in the moonlight two ru.ffians' appear,
And between them, a corpse' they did bear.
17. Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold!
Again the rough wind hurried by;
It blew off the hat of the one, and behold,
Even &amp;lose to the feet of poor Mary it rolled';
She fell; and expected to die!
18. " Stop! the hat!" he exclaims; "Nay', come on, and fast hide
The dead body'! " his comrade replies.
She beheld them in safety pass on by her side',
She seizes the hat', fear her courage supplied,
And fast through the Abbey she flies!
19. She ran with wild speed', she rush'd in at the door-,
She look'd horribly eager around':
Her limbs could support their faint burden no more;
But exhausted and breathless, she sank on the floor,
Unable to utter a sound.
20. Ere yet her pale lips could her story impart,
For a moment, the hat' met her view:
Her eyes from that object convulsively start,
For,O IIeaven'! what cold horror thrill'd through her heart,
When the name of her Richard'- she knew!
21. Where-the old Abbey stands, on the common hard by',
His gibbet is now to be seen;
Not far from the inn, it engages the eye';
The traveler beholds it, and thinks with a sigh-',
Of poor Mary, the Maid of the Inn.
XXXIX. - JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER.
FROM N. P. WILLIS.
Fon the scene which this describes, see the eleventh chapter of the Book
of Judges, from the 29th verse through.
1. SHE stood before her father's gorgeous tent,
To listen for his coming.2.       I have thought,
A brother's and a sister's love was much.
I know' a brother's' is, for I have lov'd
A trusting sister"; and I know how broke
The heart may be with its own tenderness.
But the affection of a delicate child'
For a fondfather-, gushing as it does
With the sweet springs of life, and living on
Through all earth's changes,
Must be holier!
3.         The wind bore on
The leaden tramp of thousands, Clarion notes
Rang sharply on the ear at intervals';
-And the low, mingled din of mighty hosts,
Returning from the battle, pour'd from far,
Like the deep murmur of a restless sea.
4.        Jephthah led his warriors on
Through Mizpeh's streets. His helm was proudly set',
And his stern lip curl'd slightly', as if praise
Were for the hero's scrn. His step wasfirm,
Butfree as India's leopard; and his mail,
Whose shekels none in Israel might bear',
Was lighter than a tassel on his frame.
His crest was Judah's kingliest', and the look
Of his dark, lofty eye might quell a lion.
5.       He led on'; but thoughts
Seem'd gathering round which troubled- him. The veins
Upon his forehead were distinctly seen,
And his proud lip was painfully coWpress'd.
He trod less firmly'; and his restless eye
Glanced forward frequently, as if some ill
He dared not meet, were there. His home was near,
And men were thronging, with that strange delight
They have in human passions, to observe
The struggle of his feelings with his pride.
He gazed intensely forward.
6.        A moment more-,
And he had reach'd his home; when lo! there sprang
One with a bounding footstep', and a brow
Like light, to meet'- him. Oh! how beautiful'-I
Her dark eye flashing like a sun-lit gem,
And her luxuriant hair-,'t was like the sweep
Of a swift wing in visions. He stood stillAs if the sight had wither'd' him. She threw
Her arms about his neck; he heeded not.
She call'd him " Father'," but he answer'd not.
She stood and gazed upon him. Was he wrothl'
There was no anger' in that blood-shot eye.
Had sickness' seiz'd him? She unclasp'd his helm
And laid her white hand gently on his brow.
The touch arous'd' him. He rais'd up his hands,
And spoke the name of God in agony.
7.       She knew that he was stricken then, and rush'd
Again into his arms, and with a flood
Of tears she could not stay, she sobb'd a prayer
That he would tell her of his wretchedness.
He told" her, and a momentary flush
Shot o'er her countenance: and then', the soul
Of Jephthah's daughter waken'd', and she stood
Calmly and nobly up, and said, "'T is well';
And I will die!"
8.       And when the sfin had set
Then she was dead-but n6t by violence.
XL. - TREASURES OF THE DEEP.
FROM MRS. HEMANS.
1. WHAT hid'st thou in thy treasure-caves and cells,
Thou hollow-sounding and mysterious main?
Pale glistening pearls, and rainbow-color'd shells,
Bright things, which gleam unreck'd of and in vain.
Keep', keep thy riches, melancholy sea!
We ask not sicl from thee'.
2. Yet more, thy depths have more!-What wealth untold,
Far down, and shining through their stillness, lies?
Thou hast the starry gems, the burning gold,
Won from ten thousand royal argosies.
Swieep o'er thy spoils, thou wild and wrathful main'!
Earth claims not those again!
3. Yet more, thy depths have more! Thy waves have rolled
Above the cities of a world gone by.
Sand hath fill'd up the palaces of old:
Sea-weed o'ergrown the halls of revelry:
Dash o'er them", ocean, in thy scornful play I
Man yields them to decay.
1314. Yet more`'! thy billows and thy depths have more'l
High hearts and brave are gather'd to thy breast!
They hear not now the booming waters roar,
The battle-thunders will not break their" rest;
Keep thy red gold and ggms, thou stormy grave'!
Give back the true and brave.
5. Give back the lost" and lovely"! Those, for whom
The place was kept at board and hearth so long,
The prayer went up through midnight's breathless gloom,
And the vain yearning woke'mid festal song!
Holdfast thy buried isles", thy towers o'erthrown',
But dll is not thine own I
XLI. - BATTLE IN HEAVEN.
* FROM MILTON.
JOHN MILTON, the acknowledged prince of British poets, was born in
London, in 1608. In early life he was a diligent student, and before he
attained the age of seventeen, knew six languages almost as familiarly as
his own. His immortal poem, the Paradise Lost, was written, after he was
stricken with blindness. In the latter part of his life he lived in retirement,
and died in 1674.
This lesson is adapted to the cultivation. of a low tone.
1. To whom, in brief, thus Abdiel stern replied:
Reign thou in hell, thy" kingdom; let me serve,
In heaven, God ever blest, and his divine
Behests obey", worthiest to be obey'd;
Yet chains' in hell, not realms', expect': meanwhile,
From me, (return'd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,)
This greeting on thy impious crest receive.
2. So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,
Such ruin intercept. Ten paces huge
He back recoil'd"; the tenth', on bended knee
His massy spear upstay'd"; as if on earth
Winds under ground, or waters forcing way
Sidelong, had push'd a mountains" from his seat,
Half punk with all his pines.
3.          Now storming fury rose,
And clamor such as heard in heaven till now
Was never-; arms on armor clashing, bray'd
Horrible discord, and the maddening wheelsOf brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery darts In flaming volleys flew,
And flying, vaulted either host with fire.
So, under fiery cope together rush'd
Both battles main, with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage. All heaven
Resounded'; and had earth been then, all earth
Had to her center shook. What wonder'? where
Millions of fierce encountering angels fought
On either side, the least of whom could wield
These elements, and arm him with the force
Of all their regions.
4.        Long time in even scale
The battle hung; till Satan, who that day
Prodigious power had shown, and met in arm
No equal, ranging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length,
Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and fell'd
Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway,
Brandish'd aloft, the horrid edge came down
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand,
He hasted and opposed the rocky orb
Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield
Of vast circumference. At his approach
The great Archangel from his warlike toil
Surceas'd', and glad, as hoping here to end
Intestine war in heaven, th' arch-foe subdued.
5. Now wav'd their fiery swords, and in the air
Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields
Blazed opposite, while expectation stood
In horror; from each hand with speed retired,
Where erst was thickest fight, the angelic throng,
And left large fields, unsafe within the wind
Of such commotion; such as, to set forth
Great things by small, if, nature's concord broke,
Among the constellations war were sprung,
Two planets' rushing from aspect* malign
Of fiercest opposition, in mid-sky
Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.
Observe the improper pronunciation of the word "aspect," required by the poetic accent. In this case an equal degree of force
may be given to each syllable.XLII. - PAUL'S DEFENSE BEFORE KING AGRIPPA.
FROM THE BIBLE.
[THIS should be read in a medium tone, between high and low.]
1. THIEN said Agrippa unto Paul: Thou art permitted to
speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand and
answered for himself.
~2. I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall
answer for myself, this day, before thee, touching all the
things whereof I am accused of the Jews'; especially, because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee
to hear me patiently. My manner of life from my youth',
which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem',
know all the Jews; who knew me from the beginning, if
they would testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
3. And now, I stand and am judged for the hope of the
promise made of God unto our fathers-; unto which promise
our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope
to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa', I am
accused of the Jews. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead"'?  I
verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of'Jesus of Nazareth. Which things
I also did' in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut
up in prison, having received authority from the chiefpriests, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice
against them.
4. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad
against them, I persecuted them, even unto strange cities.
Whereupon, as I went to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief-priests, at mid-day, 0 King", I saw
in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the
sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed
with' me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I
heardia voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew
tongue", Saul", Saul', why persecutest thou me'? it is hardfor thee to kick against the goads. And I said', Who art'
thou, Lord'?
5. And he said', I am Jesus', whom thou persecutest.
But rise and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those
things in the which I will appear' unto thee; delivering thee
from the people and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I
send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that
they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among
them which are sanctified, by faith that is in me.
6. Whereupon, O king Agrippa', I was not disobedient'
unto the heavenly vision; but showed first unto them  of
Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts
of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent
and turn to G-od, and do works meet for repentance. For
these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
about to kill me. Having, therefore, obtained help of God",
I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small' and
great&gt;, saying none other things than those which the
prophets and Moses did say should come; that Christ should
suffer', and that he should be the first that should rise from
the dead, and should show light unto the people and to the
Gentiles.
7. And as he thus spake, for himself, Festus said with a loud
voice, Paul, thou art besides thyself, much learning hath
made thee mad.  But he said, I am not mad', most noble
Festus', but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
For the king knoweth' of these things, before whom I speak
freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things are
hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner'.
King Agrippa', believest thou the prophets-?  I know' that
thou believest.
8. Then Agrippa said unto Paul'; Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. And Paul said, I would to
God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day,
were both almost', and altogether- such as I am, except these
bonds.  And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up,
and the governor and Bernice, and they that sat with them.ZXERCI5E.

And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, sayfng: This man doeth nothing worthy of death
or of bonds. Then said Agrippa unto Festus: This man
might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto
Caesar.
XLIII.- HENRY V. TO HIS TROOPS.
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
[THIS lesson requires a high key.]
1. ONCE more unto the breach, dear friends", once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace-, there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility;
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then", imitate the action of the tiger'-;
Stiffen the sinews'-, summon up the blood`-;
Disguise fair nature with hard-favor'd rage:
Then', lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let it pry through the portage of the head,
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it,
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
2. Now set the teeth', and stretch the nostril wide,
Hold hard the breath"', and bend' up every spirit
To its full hight! On`', on', you noble English'I
Whose blood is set from fathers of war-proof;
Fathers, that, like so many Alexanders,
Have, in these parts, from morn till even, fought,
And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument;
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war!
3.        And you, good yeomen',
Whose limbs were made in England, shows us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breedings, which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base,
That hath not noble luster in your eyes.
I see you stand like grayhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot';
Follow your spirit": and, upon this charge,
Cry--God for Harry I England I and St. Georgel137
XLIV. -HECTOR'S ATTACK ON THE GRECIAN WALLS.
FROM POPE'S TRANSLATION OF HOMER. -
ALEXANDER POPE was born in London, in 1688, and received an excellent
private education. His whole life was devoted to literary pursuits, and he
soon became the first pot of his day. Hie died at Twickenham, in 1744.
1. THEN god-like Hector and his troops contend
To force the ramparts and the gates to rend;
Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,
Till great Sarpedon tower'd amid the field.
In -arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,
And bears aloft his ample shield in air,
And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,
Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.
2. (1) So, press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow
Descends a lion" on the flocks below;
So, stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,
In sullen majest.y and stern disdain.
In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,
And shepherds gall him with an iron war;
Regardless, furious, he pursues his way,
He foams", he roars', he rends the panting prey.
3. Unmoved, the embodied Greeks their fury dare,
And fix'd, support the weight of all the war';
Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers',
Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers%-.
4. (1) As, on the confines of adjoining grounds,
Two stubborn swains' with blows dispute their bounds;
They tug', they sweat'; but neither gain nor yield
One foot, one inch of the contested field:
Thus, obstinate to death, they fight', they fall';
Nor these can keep", nor those can wini" the wall.
Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,
Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;
The copious slaughter covers all the shore,
And the high ramparts drop with human gore.
5. (1) As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,
From side to side'the trembling balance nods,
(While some laborious matron, just and poor,
With nice exactness weighs her woolly store),
12Till, pois'd aloft, the resting beam suspends
Each equal weight'-; nor this', nor that" descends.
So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might
With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.
6. (h) Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,
And fires his hosts with loud repeated cries:
Advance, ye Trojans'! lend your valiant hands',
Haste to the fleet', and toss the blazing brands"!
They hear', they run'; and gathering at his call,
Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:
Around the works a wood of glittering spears
Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.
7. A ponderous stone"' bold Hector heav'd to throw,
Pointed above', and rough and gross below':
Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
Such men as live in these degenerate days.
Yet this' as easy as a swain could bear
The snowy fleece, he toss'd and shook in air:
Thus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,
Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;
With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,
On lofty beams of solid timber hung:
Then, thundering through the planks with forceful sway,
Drives the sharp rock'; the solid beams give way',
The folds are shatter'd'; from the crackling door
Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.
8. Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,
Gloomy as night, and shakes two shining spears:
A dreadful gleam from his bright armor came,
And from his eyeballs flash'd the living flame.
He moves a god", resistless in his course,
And seems a match for more than mortal force.
Then pouring after, through the gaping space,
A tide of Trojans flows, and fill the place;
The Greeks behold", they tremble, an; they fly";
The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.XLV.  RIENZI'S ADDRESS TO THE ROMANS.

an admirable exercise for them all.]

XLVI. - THE BROKEN HEART--A SKETCH.
FROM IRVING.
WASHINGTON IRVING, born in 1783, is well known as one of the
first of American authors, and has written a large number of works.
In early life he followed literary pursuits only as an amusement, but
meeting with reverses, he devoted himself to literature as a profession.
Some years since he purchased an old Dutch Mansion, on the Hudson,
which he fitted up, and where he now resides.
1. EVERY one must recollect the tragical story of young
Emmet, the Irish patriot; it was too touching to be soon forgotten.  His fate made a deep impression on public sympathy.
During the troubles in Ireland he was tried, condemned, land
executed, on a charge of treason. He was so young&gt;, so intelligent', so generous", so brave', so every thing that we are
apt to like in a young man.  His conduct under trial, too,
was so lofty and intrepid.  The noble indignation with which
he repelled the charge of treason against his country, the eloquent vindication of his name, andI his pathetic appeal to
posterity, in the hopeless hour of condemnation, all these
entered deeply into every generous bosom', and even his enemies" lamented the stern policy that dictated his execution.
2. But there was one' heart, whose anguish it would be impossible to describe.  In happier days and'fairer fortunes", he
had won the affections of a beautiful and interesting girl', thedaughter of a late celebrated Irish barrister.  She; loved him
with the disinterested fervor of a woman's first and early love.
When every worldly maxim arrayed itself against him; when
blasted in fortune, and disgrace and danger darkened around
his name', she loved him the more ardently for his very sufferings. 4 If, then, his fate could awaken the sympathy even
of his foes', what must have been the agony of her', whose
whole soul was occupied by his image! Let those tell who
have had the portals of the tomb suddenly closed between
them and the being they most loved on earth', who have sat
at its threshold, as one shut out in a cold and lonely world,
whence all that was most lovely and loving had departed.
3. But then the horrors of such' a grave! so frightful', so
dishonored'! there was nothing for memory to dwell on, that
could soothe the pangs of separation', none of those tender,
though melancholy circumstances, which endear the parting
scene', nothing to melt sorrow into those blessed tears, sent
like the dews of heaven to revive the heart in the parting hour
of anguish..
4. To render her widowed situation more desolate, she had
incurred her father's displeasure by her unfortunate attachment, and was an exile from the paternal roof. But could
the sympathy and kind offices of friends have reached a spirit
So shocked and driven in by horror, she would have experienced no want of consolation', for the Irish are a people of
quick and generous sensibilities.  The most delicate and cherishing attentions were paid her by families of wealth and distinction. She was led into society, and they tried by all kin-ds
of occupation and amusement to dissipate her grief, and
wean her from the tragical story of her love.
5. But it was all in vain.-  There are some strokes of
calamity which scathe and scorch the soul, which penetrate to
the vital seat of happiness; and blast it, never again to put
forth bud or blossom. She never objected to frequent the
haunts of pleasure, but was as much alone there as in the
depths of solitude'; walking about in a sad reverie, apparently unconscious of the world around her.  She carried with
her an inward woe, that mocked at all the blandishments of
friendship, and " heeded not the song of the charmer, charm
he never so wisely."  NEW SIXTH READER.
6. The person who told me her story had seen her at a
masquerade. There can be no exhibition of far-gone wretchedness more striking and painful than to meet it in such' a
scene; to find it wandering like a specter lone and joyless,
where all around is gay', to see it dressed out in the trappings of mirth, and looking so wan and woe-begone, as if it
had tried in vain to cheat the poor heart into a momentary
forgetfulness of sorrow. After strolling through the splendid
rooms and giddy crowd with an air of utter abstraction, she
sat herself down on the steps of an orchestra, and, looking
about for some time with a vacant air, that showed her insensibility to the garish scene, she began with the capriciousness of a sickly heart, to warble a little plaintive air. She
had an exquisite voice; but on this occasion it was so simple,
so touching", it breathed forth such a soul of wretchedness,
that she drew a crowd mute and silent around her, and melted
every one into tears.
7. The story of one so true and tender could not but excite great interest in a country remarkable for enthusiasm.
It completely won the heart of a brave officer, who paid his
addresses to her', and thought that one so true to the dead
could not but prove affectionate to the living. She declined
his attentions&gt;, for her thoughts were irrevocably engrossed
by the memory of her former lover. He, however, persisted
in his suit. He solicited not her tenderness, but her esteem.
He was assisted by her conviction of his worth, and her sense
of her own destitute and dependent situation", for she was
existing on the kindness of friends. In a word, he at length
succeeded in gaining her hand, though with the solemn
assurance that her heart was unalterably another's.
8. He took her with him to Sicily, hoping that a change
of scene might wear out the remembrance of her early woes.
She was an amiable and exemplary wife, and made an effort
to be a happy one; but nothing could cure the silent and
devouring melancholy that had' entered into her very soul.
She wasted away in a slow but hopeless decline', and, at
length, sank into the grave, the victim of a broken heart.XLVII.  THE PRISONER FOR DEBT.
FROM WHITTIER.
1. LooKs on him: through his dungeon-grate
Feebly and cold, the morning light
Comes stealing round him, dim and late,
As if it loath'd the sight.
Reclining on his strawy bed,
His hand upholds his drooping head;
His bloodless cheek is seam'd and hard;
Unshorn his gray, neglected beard;
And o'er his. bony fingers flow
His long dishevel'd locks of snow.
2. No grateful fire before him glows,
And yet the winter's breath is chill:
And o'er his half-clad person goes
The frequent ague-thrill.
Silent', save ever and anon',
A sound, half-murmur and half-groan',
Forces apart the painful grip
Of the old sufferer's bearded lip.
0, sad and crushing is the fate
Of old age chain'd and desolate.
3. Just GOD! why lies that old man there?
A murderer shares his prison-bed,
Whose eyeballs, through his horrid hair',
Gleam on him fierce and red;
And the rude oath and heartless jeer
Fall ever on his loathing ear'-;
And, or in wakefulness' or sleep',
Nerve, flesh, and fiber thrill and creep,
Whene'er that ruffian's tossing limb,
Crimson'd with murder, touches him.
4. What has the gray-hair'd prisoner done?
Has niurder stain'd his hands with gore?
Not so': his crime's a fouler' one:
God made the 51d man poor!
For this, he shares a felon's' cell,
The fittest earthly type of hell':
For this, the boon for which he pour'd
His young blood on the invader's sword,.
And counted light the fearful cost,
His blood-gain'd liberty-is lost t5. And so, for such a place of rest,
Old prisoner, pour'd thy blood as rain
On Concord's field, and Bunker's crest,
And Saratoga's' plain?
Look forth", thou man of many scars-',
Through thy dim dungeon's iron bars I
It must be joy, in sooth", to see
Yon m6nument* uprear'd to thee-;
Piled granite' and a prison-cell'I
The land repays thy service well!
6. Go", ring the bells`, and fire the guns`',
And fling'the starry banner out';
Shout' "Freedom I" till your lisping ones
Give back their cradle-shout;
Let boasted eloquence declaim
Of honor, liberty, and fame;
Still let the poet's strain be heard,
With "glory" for each second word,
And every thing with breath agree
To praise " our glorious liberty!"
7. And when the patriot cannon jars
That prison's- cold and gloomy wall,.
And through its grates the stripes and stars
Rise on the wind, and fall;
Think you that prisoner's aged ear
Rejoices in the general cheer?
Think ye his, dim and failing eye
Is kindled at your pageantry?
Sorrowing of soul, and chain'd of limb,
What is your carnival to. himn  
8. Down with the law that binds him thus!I
Unworthy freemen, let it find
No refuge from the withering curse
Of GOD and human kind!
Open the prisoner's living tomb',
And usher from its- brooding gloom
The victims of your savage code,
To the free sun and air of GOD I
No longer dare as crime to brand
The chastening of the Almighty's hand I

XLVIII.- LA FAYETTE AND ROBERT RAIKES.
FROM GRIMKE.
THOMAS S. GRIMKE was a distinguished lawyer of Charleston,
South Carolina. He was a man of great learning, pure and high
toned religious sentiment, and remarkable eloquence.
LA FAYETTE was a French nobleman, who gave his services and
spent his fortune in aid of America in the Revolutionary War, whioh
terminated in 1783. In 1824 he revisited this country, and was
received with an enthusiasm seldom equaled.
[Extract from an address delivered at a Sunday-School Celebration.]
1. IT is but a few years, since we beheld the most singular
and memorable pageant in the annals of time. It was a pageant
more sublime and affecting than the progress of Elizabeth
through England after the defeat of the armada; than the return of Francis I. from a Spanish prison to his own beautiful
France; than the daring and rapid march of the conqueror at
Austerlitz from Frejus to Paris. It was a pageant, indeed,
rivaled only in the elements of the grand and the pathetic,
by the journey of our own Washington, through the different
States. Need I say that I allude to the visit of La Fayette
to America'?
2. But La Fayette returned to the land of the deadc, rather
than of the living".  How many who had fought with him in
the war of'76, had died in arms, and lay buried in the grave
of the soldier or the sailor! How many who had survived the
perils of battle, on the land and the ocean, had expired
on the death-bed of peace, in the arms of mother', sister",
daughter', wife'! Those who survived to celebrate with him
the jubilee of 1825, were stricken in years, and hoary-headed;
many of them infirm in health; many the victims of poverty-,
or misfortune', or affliction-. And, how venerable that patriotic company'; how sublime, their.gathering through all
the land-; how joyful their welcome, how affecting their farewell" to that beloved stranger!
3. But the pageant has fled&gt;, and the very materials" that
gave it such depth of i'nterest, are rapidly perishing': and a
humble, perhaps a nameless grave, shall hold the last soldier
of the Revolution. And shall they ever meet again? Shall
the patriots and soldiers of'76; the Immortal Band, as

history styles them; meet again in the ainaranthine bowers
of spotless purity, of perfect bliss, of eternal glory? Shall
theirs be the Christian's Heaven, the kingdom of the Redeemer?  The heathen points to his fabulous Elysium as the
Paradise of the soldier and the sage. But the Christian'
bows down with tears and sighs, for he knows that not many
of the patriots, and statesmen, and warriors of Christian
lands, are the disciples of Jesus.
4. But we turn from La Fayette, the favorite of the old
and the new world, to the peaceful benevolence, the unambitious achievements of Robert Raikes. Let us imagine him
to have been still alive-, and to have visited our land, to
celebrate this day with us. No national ships would have
been offered to bear him', a nation's guest', in the pride of
the star-spangled banner', from the bright shores of the
rising, to the brighter shores of the setting' sun. No cannon
would have hailed him" in the stern language of the battlefield, the fortunate champion of Freedom, in Europe and
America'. No martial music would have welcomed him" in
notes of rapture, as they rolled along the Atlantic, and
echoed through the valley of the Mississippi'. No military
procession would have heralded his' way through crowded
streets, thick-set with the banner and the plume, the glittering saber, and the polished bayonet'. No cities would have
called forth beauty and fashion, wealth and rank, to honor
him' in the ball-room and theater.  No states would have
escorted him' from boundary to boundary, nor have sent
their chief-magistrate to do him- homage. No national liberality would have allotted to him'n a nobleman's- domain,
and princely treasure". No national gratitude would have
hailed him' in the capitol itself, the nation's guest, because
the nation's benefactor-; and have consecrated a battle-ship',
in memory of his wounds and his gallantry.
5. Not such would have been the reception of Robert
Raikes, in the land of the Pilgrims' and of Penn', of the
Catholic', the Cavalier', and the Huguenot'.  And who
does not rejoice', that it would be impossible thus to welcome
this primitive Christian, the founder of Sunday-schools.
His' heralds would be the preachers of the Gospel&gt;, and the
eminent in piety, benevolence, and zeal.  His' procession147
would number in its ranks the messengers of the Cross and
the disciples of the Savior', Sunday-school teachers and
white-robed scholars. The temples of the Most High`' would
be the scenes of his" triumph.  Homage and gratitude to
him-', would be anthems of praise' and thanksgiving to
God,.
6. Parents would honor him as more than a brother-;
children would reverence him as more than a father. The
faltering words of age, the firm and sober voice of manhood,
the silvery notes of youth, would bless him as a Christian
patron.  The wise and the good would acknowledge him
everywhere, as a national benefactor', as a patriot even to a
land of strangers.  He would have come a messenger of peace
to a land"  of peace.  No images of camps, and sieges, and
battles; no agonies of the dying and the wounded; no shouts
of victory, or processions of triumph, would mingle with the
recollections of the multitudes who welcomed him.  They
would mourn over no common dangers, trials, and calamities;
for the road of duty has been to them the path of pleasantness, the way of peace.  Their memory of the past would be
rich in gratitude to God, and love to man; their enjoyment
of the present would be a prelude to heavenly bliss; their
prospects of the future, bright and glorious as faith and
hope.
7. Such was the reception of La Fayette, the warrzor; such
would be that of Robert Raikes', the Howard of the Christian church.  And which is the nobler benefactor, patriot,
and philanthropist?  Mankind may admire and extol La
Fayette', more than the founder of the Sunday-schools'-; but
religion, philanthropy, and enlightened common sense, must
ever esteem Robert Raikes" the superior of La Fayette'.
His" are the virtues, the services, the sacrifices of a more
enduring and exalted order of being.  HEis counsels and
triumphs belong less to time' than to eternity.8. The fame of La Fayette is of this' world; the glory of
Robert Raikes is of the Redeemer's everlasting kingdom"`.
La Fayette lived chiefty for his own age, and chiefly for his
and our country.  But Robert Raikes has lived for all ages,
and all countries. Perhaps the historian and biographer may
never interweave his name in the tapestry of national or indiNEW SIXTH READER.
vidual renown.  But the records of every single church,
honor him as a patron'; the records of the Universal Church,
on earth and in heaven, bless him as a benefactor.
9. The time may come when the name of La Fayette will
be forgotten'; or when the star of his fame, no longer glittering in the zenith, shall be seen, pale and glimmering, on
the verge of the horizon. But the name of Robert Raikes
shall never' be forgotten; and the lambent flame of his glory
is that eternal fire which rushed down from heaven to devour
the. sacrifice of Elijah. Let mnortals then admire and imitate
La Fayette, more than Robert Raikes. But the just made
perfect, and the ministering spirits around the throne of God,
have welcomed him as a fellow-ervant of the same Lord; as
a fellow-laborer in the same glorious cause of man's redemption; as a co-heir of the same precious promises and eternal
rewards.
XLIX.- ON HAPPINESS OF TEMPER.
FROM GOLDSMITH.
1. WRITERS of every age have endeavored to show that
pleasure is in us', and not in the objects' offered for our
amusement'. If the soul' be happily disposed, every thing
becomes capable of affording entertainment, and distress will
almost want a name. Every occurrence passes in review,
like the figures of a procession'; some may be awkward,
others' ill-dressed'; but none but afool' is, on that account,
enraged with the master of ceremonies.
2. I remember to have once seen a slave, in a fortification in Flanders, who appeared no way touched with his
situation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained&gt;; obliged
to toil from the appearance of day till night-fall', and condemned to this for life'; yet with all these circumstances of
apparent wretchedness, he sang, would have danced, but
that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merriest, happiest
man of all the garrison. What a practical philosopher was
here'!  A  happy constitution supplied philosophy; and,
though seemingly destitute of wisdom, he was really wise.
No reading or study had contributed to disenchant the fairyland around him. Every thing furnished him with an,ECLECTIC  SERIES.                     149
opportunity of mirth; and though some thought him, from
his insensibility, a fool, he was such`' an idiot, as philosophers should wish to imitate.
3. They who, like that slave, can place themselves on
that side of the world in which every thing appears in a
pleasant light, will find some thing in every occurrence, to
excite their good humor.  The most calamitous events,
either to themselves" or others', can bring no new affliction'; the world is to them a theater, on which only comediesare acted. All the bustle of heroism or the aspirations of
ambition, seem only to highten the absurdity of the scene,
and make the humor more poignant.  They feel, in short, as
little anguish at their own distress or the complaints of
others, as the undertaker', though dressed in black, feels
sorrow at a funeral.
4. Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Cardinal de
Retz possessed this happiness in the highest degree. When
fortune wore her angriest look, and he fell into the power of
Cardinal Mazarine, his most deadly enemy, (beingconfined
a close prisoner in the castle of Valenciennes,) he never
attempted to support his distress by wisdom or philosophy,
for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at himself'
and his persecutor', and seemed infinitely pleased. at his new
situation. In this mansion of distress, though denied all
amusements and even the conveniences of life, and entirely
cut off from all intercourse with his friends, he still retained
his good humor', laughed at the little spite of his enemies',
and carried the jest so far as to write the life of his jailor.
5. All that the wisdom of the proud can teach is, to be
stubborn or sullen under misfortunes. The cardinal's example will teach us to be good-humored in circumstances of
the highest affliction.  It matters not whether our good
humor be construed by others into insensibility' or idiotism-;
it is happiness to ourselves'; and none but a fool could
measure his satisfaction by what the world' thinks of it.
6. The happiest fellow I ever knew, was of the number
of those good-natured creatures,.that are said to do no harm
to any body but themselves. Whenever he fell into any
misery, he called it 4'seeing life."  If his head was broken
by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a sharper, he comrn0,NEW SIXTH READER.
forted himself by imitating the Hibernian dialect of the one,
or the more fashionable cant of the other. Nothing came
amiss' to him. His inattention to money matters, had concerned his father to such a degree, that all intercession of
friends was fruitless. The old gentleman was on his deathbed.  The whole family (and Dick among the number)
gathered around him.
7.. "I leave my second son, Andrew," said the expiring
miser, "my whole estate'; and desire him  to be frugal."
Andrew, in a sorrowful tone', (as is usual on such occasions-,)
prayed heaven to prolong his life and health, to enjoy it himself.  "I recommend Simon, my third son', to the care of
his elder brother', and leave him, besides, four thousand
pounds."  "Ah, father'!" cried Simon', (in great affliction,
to be sure',) "may heaven give you life and health to enjoy
it yourself"!" At last turning to poor Dick: "As for you,
you have always been a sad dog'; you'll never come to good',
you'11 never be rich'; I leave you a shilling to buy a halter."
"Ah, father'!" cries Dick, without any emotion', "May
heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself!"
L. - THE FORTUNE TELLER.
FROM oMACKENSIE.
1. HARLEY sat down on a large stone, by the way-side, to
take a pebble from his shoe, when he saw, at some distance, a
beggar' approaching him. He had on a loose sort of coat,
mended with different-colored rags, among which the blue and
russet were predominant. He had a short, knotty stick in his
hand; and on the top of it was stuck a ram's horn; he wore
no shoes, and his stockings had entirely lost that part of them
which would have covered his feet and ancles; in his face,
however, was the plump appearance of good humor; he
walked a good round pace, and a crook-legged dog trotted at
his heels.
2. "Our delicacies," said Harley to himself, "are fantastic; they are not in nature! That beggar' walks over the
sharpest of these stones barefooted, whilst 1' have lost the
most delightful dream in the world, from the smallest of them151
happening to get into my shoe"." The beggar had by this
time come up, and pulling off a piece of a hat, asked charity"
of Harley.  The dog began to beg too. It was impossible to
resist both; and, in truth, the want of shoes and stockings
had made both unnecessary", for Harley had destined sixpence for him before.
3. The beggar, on receiving it, poured forth blessings
without number"; and, with a sort of smile on his countenance, said to Harley "that if he wanted to have his fortune
told'"--Harley turned his eye briskly upon the beggar"; it
was an unpromising look for the subject of a prediction', and
silenced the prophet immediately. "I would much rather
learn," said Harley, "what it is in your power" to tell me.
Your trade must be an entertaining one; sit down on this
stone, and let me know something of your profession; I have often thought of turning fortune-teller for a week or two, myself."
4. "Master','" replied the beggar", "I like your frankness
much'   I had the humor of plain dealing in me from a
chil         e is no doing with it in this world; we must
do   wie can; and lying is, as you call it, my profession.
But I was in some sort forced' to the trade, for I once dealt
in telling the truth.  I was a laborer, sir; and gained as much as
to make me live. I never laid by', indeed; for I was reckoned
a piece of a wag', and your wags, I take it, are seldom rich,
Mr. Harley."  "So," said Harley, "you seem to know me."
"Ay", there are few folks in the country that I don't know
something' of. How should I tell fortunes" else?"  "True';
but go on with your story'; you were a laborer', you say,
and a wag'; your industry, I suppose, you left with your
old' trade; but your humor you preserved to be of use to
you in your new."
5. "What signifies sadness", sir? A man grows lean" on't.
But I was brought to my idleness by degrees; sickness" first
disabled me, and it went against my stomach to work ever
after. But in truth I was for a long time so weak, that I
spit blood whenever I attempted to work. I had no relation
living, and I never kept a friend above a week when I was
able to joke. Thus I was forced to beg my bread, and a
sorry trade I have found' it, Mr. Harley". I told all my misfortunes truly, but they were seldom believed; and the few whogave.me a half-penny as they passed, did it with a shake of
the head, and an injunction not to trouble them with a long
story. In short, I found that people don't care to give alms
without some secuLrity' for their money; such as a wooden leg"'
or a withered arm"n, for example. So I changed' my plan,
and instead of telling my own misfortunes, began to prophesy
happiness to others'.
6. "This I found by much the better way. Folks will
always listen when the tale is their own', and of many who
say they do not believe in fortune-telling, I have known few
on whom it had not a very sensible effect. I pick up the
names of their acquaintance'; amours and little squabbles
are easily gleaned from among servants and neighbors"; and
indeed, people themselves' are the best intelligencers in the
world for our purpose. They dare not puzzle us for their
own`' sakes, for every one is anxious to hear what they wish
to believe; and they who repeat it, to laugh at it when they
have done, are generally more serious than,           ti1L'rers
are apt to imagine.  With a tolerably go#-..'and
some share of cunning, I succeed reasonably well as a fortuneteller.  With this, and showing the tricks of that dog, I
make shift to pick up a livelihood.
7. "My trade is none of the most honest, yet people are not
much cheated after all, who give a few half pence for a prospect of happiness, which I have heard some persons say, is all
a man can arrive at, in this' world. But I must bid you
good day', sir; for I have three miles to walk before noon, to
inform some boarding-school young ladies, whether" their
husbands are to be peers of the realm, or captains in the army";
a question which I promised to 4answer them by that time."
8. Harley had drawn a shilling from  his pocket'; but:'
Virtue bade him consider on whom he was going to bestow"
it. Virtue held back his arm"; but a milder form, a younger
sister of Virtue's, not so severe as Virtue, nor so serious as
Pity, smiled- upon him; his fingers lost their compression;
nor did Virtue' appear to catch the money as it fell. It had
no sooner reached the ground, than the watchful cur (a trick
he had been taught) snapped it up; and, contrary to the
most approved method of stewardship, delivered it immediately into the hands of his master..LI. -- SATAN, SIN, AND DEATH.
FRonI MILTON.
[THE following lesson requires variety of tone.]
1. MEANWHILE the adversary of God and man-,
Satan', with thoughts inflamed of highest design,
Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of hell,
Explores his solitary flight": sometimes
He scours the right' hand Coast, sometimes the left';
Now shaves with level wing the deep', then soars
Up to the fiery concave towering high.
2.       At last, appear
Hell bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,
And thrice three-fold the gates'; three folds were brass',
Three iron, three of adamantine rock
Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,
Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat,
O0ei-ther side, a- formidable shape':
_         seem'd woman to the waist, and fair;
~"ej~foul in many a scaly fold,
Voluminous and vast', a serpent, arm'd
With mortal sting'; about her middle round,
A cry of hell-hounds never ceasing bark'd,
With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung
A hideous peal.'3.        The other shape
If shape it might be call'd, that shape had none,
Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;
Or substance might be called that shadow seem'd,
For each seem'd either; black it stood as night',
Fierce as ten furies', terrible as hell',
And shook a dreadful dart': what seem'd his head,
The likeness of a kingly crown' had on.
4. Satan was now at hand, and from his seat
The monster moving onward, came as fast
With horrid strides; hell trembled as he strode.
The undaunted fiend what this might be, admired,
Admired', not fear?d; God and his Son except
Created thing nought valued he, nor shunn'd';
And with disdainful look thus first began:
5 (h) "Whence and what art' thou, execrable shape?
That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advanceNEW SIXTH READER.
Thy miscreated front athwart my way
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass',
That be assured', without leave ask'd of thee':
Retire', or taste" thy folly; and learn by proof,
Hell-born', not to contend with spirits of heaven."
6. To whom the goblin, full of wrath, replied:
(h) ",Art thou that traitor-angel', art thou he
Who first broke peace in heaven", and faith, till then
Unbroken-; and in proud rebellious arms
Drew after him the third part of heaven's sons,
Conjured against the highest', for which, both thou
And they, out-cast from God', are here condemn'd
To waste eternal days in woe and pain"?
And reckonest thou thyself with spirits of heaven',
Hell doom'd'! and breath'st defiance here and scorn,
Where I' reign king; and to enrage thee more,
Thy' king and lord'?  Back' to thy punishment',
False fugitive! and to thy speed add wings;
Lest with a whip of scorpions, I pursue
Thy lingering, or, with one stroke of this dari
Strange horrors seize thee, and pangs unfelt'
7. So spake the grizzly terror', and in shape
So speaking and so threatening, grew ten-fold
More dreadful and deform. On the other side,
Incens'd with indignation, Satan stood
Unterrified', and like a comet burn'd,
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
In the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head
Level'd his deadly aim'; their fatal hands
No second' stroke intend; and such a frown
Each cast at the other', as when two black clouds,
With heaven's artillery fraught, come rattling on
Over the Caspian'; they stand front to front,
Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow
To join their dark encounter in mid air.
8. So frown'd the mighty combatants, that hell
Grew darker at the frown': so match'd-, they stood'-:
For never but once more was either like
To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds
Had been achiev'd, whereof all hell had rung,
Had not the snaky sorceress that sat
Fast by hell gate, and kept the fatal key,
Risen and with hideous outcry rush'd between.LII. - GOD IS EVERYWHERE.
1. OH! show me where is He,
The high and holy One',
To whom thou bend'st the knee,
And pray'st-, "Thy will be done 1"
I hear thy song of praise,
And lo! no form' is near:
Thine eyes I see thee raise,
But where doth God appear?
Oh! teach me who is- God, and where his glories shine,
That I may kneel and pray, and call thy Father mine.
2. "Gaze on that arch above':
The glittering vault admire.
Who taught those orbs to move?
Who lit their ceaseless fire?
Who guides the moon to run
In silence through the skies?
Who bids that dawning sun
In strength and beauty rise?
There view immensity'! behold'! my God is there:
The sun" the moon', the stars`', his majesty declare'.
3. "Seewhere the mountains' rise;
Where thundering torrent?s foam;
Where, vail'd in towering skies,
The eagle" makes his home:
Where savage nature dwells,
My God is present too"';
Through all her wildest dells
His footsteps I pursue:
He'e rear d those giant cliffs, supplies that dashin; stream,
Provides the daily food which stills the wild bird's'scream.
4. " Look on that world of waves,
Where finny nations glide;
Within whose deep, dark caves
The ocean-monsters hide:
His power is sovereign there,
To raise', to quell"- the storm;
The depths his bounty share,
Where sport the scaly swarm:
Tempests and calms obey the same almighty voice,
Which rules the earth and skies', and bids far worlds rejoice.LESSONS IN POE,TRY.

LIII. - IRONICAL EULOGY ON DEBT.
1. DEBT is of the very highest antiquity.  The first debt in
the history of man is the debt of nature, and the first instinct
is to put off the payment of it to the last moment.  Many persons, it will be observed, following the natural procedure,
would die before they would pay their debts.:g
2. Society is composed of two classes&gt;, debtors' and creditors'. The creditor class has been erroneously supposed the
more enviable. Never was there a greater misconception';
and the hold it yet maintains upon opinion, is a remarkable
example of the obstinacy of error, notwithstanding the plainest
lessons of experience. The debtor has the sympathies of
mankind.  He is seldom spoken of but with expressions of
tenderness and compassion-" the poor debtor'! "-and " the
unfortunate debtor"!"  On the other hand, "harsh" and
" hard-hearted " are the epithets allotted to the creditor. Who
ever heard the " poor creditor," the "unfortunate creditor'"
spoken of? No&gt;, the creditor never becomes the object of
pity, unless he passes into the debtor class. A creditor may
be ruined by the poor debtor, but it is not until he becomes
unable to pay his own debts, that he begins to be compassionated.
3. A debtor is a man of mark. Many eyes are fixed upon
him&gt;; many have interest in his well-being": his movements
are of concern: he can not disappear unheeded"; his name is
in many mouths'; his name is upon many books"; he is a
man of note"--of promissoryp note; he fills the speculation157
of many minds'; men conjecture' about him, wonder' about
him, wonder and conjecture whether he will.pay. He is a
man of consequence', for many are running' after him. His
door is thronged with duns. He is inquired after every hour
of the day. Judges' hear of him and know him. Every meal
he swallows', every coat he puts upon his back', every dollar
he borrows", appears before the country in some formal
document'. Compare his' notoriety with the obscure lot of
the creditor', of the man who has nothing but claims on the
world; a landlord, or fund-holder, or some such' disagreeable,
hard character.
4. The man who pays his way is unknown in his neighborhood. You ask the milk-man at his door, and he can not tell
his name. You ask the butcher where Mr. Payall lives", and
he tells you he knows no such name', for it is not in his
books. You shall ask the baker, and he will tell you there is
no such person in the neighborhood. People that have his
money'-fast in their pockets, have no thought of his person or
appellation. His house only is known. No. 31 is good pay.
No. 31 is ready money. Not a scrap of paper is ever made
out for No. 31. It is an anojy1mous' house; its owner pays
his way to obscurity. No one knows anything about him,
or heeds his movements. If a carriage be seen at his door,
the neighborhood is not full of concern lest he be going to
run away. If a package be moved from his house, a score
of boys are not employed to watch whether it be carried to
the pawnbroker. Mr. Payall fills no place in the public
mind'; no one has any hopes or fears about him.
5. The creditor always figures in the fancy as a sour, single
man, with grizzled hair, a scowling countenance, and a
peremptory air&gt;, who lives in a dark Apartment, with musty
deeds about him, and an iron safe, as impenetrable as
his heart&gt;, grabbing together what he does not enjoy, and
what there is no one about' him  to enjoy.  The debtor,
on the other hand, is always pictured with a wife and six
fair-haired daughters, bound together in affection and misery', full of sensibility, and suffering without a fault. The
creditor, it is never doubted, thrives without a merit. He
has no wife and children to pity. No one ever thinks it desirable that he" should have the means of living". He is a158            NEW   SIXTI  READER.
brute for insisting that he must receive, in order to pay. It
is not in the imagination of man to conceive' that his creditor
has demands upon him which must be satisfied', and that he
must do to others, as others must do to him. A creditor is a
personification of exaction.  He is supposed to be always
taking in', and never giving out.
6. People idly fancy, that the possession of riches is desirable. What blindness'! Spend and regale'. Save a shilling
and you lay it by for a thief. The prudent men are the men
that live beyond their means. Happen what may, they are
safe. They have taken time by the forelock. They have
anticipated fortune.  "The wealthy fool, with gold in store,"
has only denied himself so much enjoynient, which another
will seize at his expense. Look at these people in a panic.
See who are the fools then. You know them by their long.faces. You may say, as one of them goes by, in an agony of
apprehension, " There is a stupid fellow who fancied himself
rich, because he had fifty thousand dollars in bank." The
history of the last ten years has taught the moral, "spend,
and regale." Whatever is laid up beyond the present hour,
is put in jeopardy.  There is no certainty but in instant
enjoyment'.  Look at school-boys sharing a plum-cake. The
knowing ones eat, as for a race; but a stupid' fellow saves his
portion; just nibbles a bit, and "keeps the rest for another
4tae,."  Most provident blockhead!  The others, when they
have gobbled up their' saires, set upon him', plunder him,
and thresh him for crying out.
7. Before the, terms "depreciation," "suspension," and
" going into liquidation,"-were heard, there might have been
some reason in the practice of "laying up;" but now' it
denotes the darkest blindness. The prudent men of the
present time, are the men in debt. The tendency being to
sacrifice creditors to debtors, and the debtor party acquiring
daily new strength, ewery one is in haste to get into the favored class. In any case, the debtor' is safe. He has put
his enjoyments behind' him; they are safe'; no turns of fortune can disturb': them.  The substance he has eaten up,
is irrecoverable.  The future can not trouble his past. He
has nothing to apprehend. He has anticipated more than
fortune would ever have granted' him. He has tricked- fortune; and his creditors--bah'! who feels for creditors'?
What are' creditors?  Landlords; a pitiless and unpitiable
tribe'; all griping, extortioners'! What would become of
the world of debtors', if it did not steal a march upon this
rapacious class'?
LIV. - FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY.
FROM HooD.
1. BEN BATTLE was a soldier bold,
And used to war's alarms;
But a cannon-ball took off his legs,
So he laid down his arms.
2. Now, as they bore him off the field,
Said he, "Let others" shoot,
For here I leave my second leg
And the Forty-second foot."
3. The army surgeons made him limbs';
Said he, "They're only pegs',
But there's as wooden members quite
As represent my legs."
4. Now Ben, he loved a pretty maid',
Her name' was NelGray-;
So he went 0o pay her is devoirs-',
When he'd derour'd his pay.
5. But when he call'd on Nelly Gray,
She made him quite a scoff,
And when she saw his wooden legs',
Began to take them off
6. "O, Nelly Gray'! O, Nelly Gray-I
Is this your love so warmI
The love that loves a scarlet coat,
Should be more uniform."
7. Said she', "I lov'd a soldiers once
-  For he was blithe and; brave,;
But I will never have a man
With both legs in the grave'.8. "Before you had these timber toes,
Your love I did allow','
But then, you know, you stand upon
Another footing' now."
9. "0, false and fickle Nelly Gray,
I know why you refuse:
Though I've no fee'--another' man
Is standing in my shoes.
10. "I wish I ne'er had seen your face;
But, now, a long farewell!
For you will be my death';--alas'1
You will not be my NELL!"
11. Now when he went from Nelly Gray,
IIis heart so heavy got,
And life was such a burden grown,
It made him take a knot.
12. So, round his melancholy neck
A rope he did entwine',
And for the second time in life,
Enlisted in the Line.
13. One end he tied around a beam,
And then removed his pegs",
And1 as his legs were off, of course,
He soon was off his legs.
14. And there he hung till he was dead.
As any nail in town':
For though distress had cut him up,
It could not cut him down.
160LV.  DESCRIPTION OF A SIEGE.
FROM WALTER SCOTT.
IVANHOE, a Wounded knight, and Rebecca, a Jewess, had been imprisoned in the castle of Reginald Front de Boeuf. The friends of
the prisoners undertake their rescue. At the request of Ivanhoe, who
is upable to leave his couch, Rebecca takes her stand near a window
overlooking the approach to the castle, and details to the knight the
incidents of the contest, as they take place. Front de Boeuf and his
garrison were Normans; the besiegers, Saxons.
Barbacan, an outer defense, or fortification, used as a watch tower.
1. THE skirts of the wood seem lined with archers,
although only a few are advanced from its dark shadow.
"'Under *hat banner?" asked Ivanhoe. " Under no ensign
which I can observe," answered Rebecca.  " A singular novelty," muttered the knight, "to advance to storm  such a
castle without pennon or banner displayed.  Seest thou
who they be, that act as leaders?" "A knight clad in
sable armor is the most conspicuous," said the Jewess: "he
alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the
direction of all around him."
2. "' Seem there no other leaders?" exclaimed the anxious
inquirer.  " None of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station," said Rebecca, "but doubtless the
other side of the castle is also assailed. They seem, even
now, preparing to advance. God of Zion protect us! What
a dreadful sight!  Those, who advance first, bear huge
shields and defenses made of plank: the others follow, bending their bows as they come on. They raise their bows!
God of Moses, forgive the creatures thou hast made!"
3. Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the
signal for assault, which was given by the blast of a shrill
bugle; and at once answered by a flourish of the Norman
trumpets from the battlements, which, mingled with the
deep and hollow clang of the kettle-drums, retorted in notes
of defiance, the challenge of the enemy. The shouts of
both parties augmented the fearful din, the assailants crying,
"Saint George, for merry England-!" and the Normans answering them with loud cries of "Onward, De Bracy! Front
de Boeuf, to the rescue!"
14NEW SIXTH READER.
4. "And I must lie here, like a bed-ridden monk," exclaimed Ivanhoe, "while the game, that gives me freedom or
death, is played out by the hand of others! Look from the
window once again, kind maiden, and tell me if they yet
advance to the storm." With patient courage, strengthened
by the interval which she had employed in mental devotion,
Rebecca again took post at the lattice, sheltering herself,
however, so as not to be exposed to the arrows of the archers.
"What dost thou see, Rebecca?" again demanded the
wounded knight. " Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying
so thick as to dazzle mine eyes, and to hide the bowmen who
shoot them."  "That can not endure," said Ivanhoe. "If
they press not right on, to carry the castle by force of arms,
the archery may avail but little against stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the knight in dark armor, fair Rebecca,
and see how he bears himself; for as the leader is, so will
his followers be."
5. "I see him not," said Rebecca. "Foul craven!" exclaimed Ivanhoe; "does he blench from the helm, when the
wind blows highest?"  "He- blenches not! he blenches
not!" said Rebecca; "I see him  now: he leads a body of
men close under the outer barrier of the barbacan. They
pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers with axes. His high, black plume floats abroad over
the throng, like a raven over the field of the slain. They
have made a breach in the barriers, they rush in, they are
thrust back!  Front de Boeuf heads the defenders. I see
his gigantic form above the press. They throng again to
the breach, and the pass is disputed, hand to hand, and man
to man. God of Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce tides,
the conflict of two oceans moved by adverse winds:" and
she turned her head from the window, as if unable longer to
endure a sight so terrible.
6. Speedily recovering her self-control, Rebecca again
looked forth, and almost imimediately exclaimed, "' Holy
prophets of the law! Front de Boeuf and the Black Knight
fight hand to hand on the breach, amid the roar of their
followers, who watchr the progress of the strife. Heaven
strike with the cause of the oppressed and of the captive!"
She then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, " He is down!163
he is down I"  "Who is down?" cried Ivanhoe; " for our
dear Lady's sake, tell me which has fallen I"  "The Black
Knight," answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again
shouted with joyful eagerness--" But no 1 but no! the name
of the Lord of Hosts be blessed! he is on foot again, and
fights as if there were twenty men's strength in his single
arm-his sword is broken-he snatches an ax from a yeoman-he presses Front de Boeuf, blow on blow-the giant
stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the woodman-he falls-he falls!"  Front de Boeuf?" exclaimed
Ivanhoe. "Front de Boeuf," answered the Jewess; "his
men rush to the rescue, headed by the haughty Templar,jtheir united force compels the champion to pause-they drag
Front de Boeuf within the walls."
7. The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?"
said Ivanhoe. "They have-they have,-and they press the
besieged hard, upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some
swarm like bees, and endeavor to ascend upon the shoulders
of each other; down go stones, beams, and trunks of trees
upon their heads, and as fast as they bear the wounded to
the rear, fresh men supply their places in the assault. Great
God! hast thou given men thine own image, that it should
be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!"Think not of that," replied Ivanhoe; "this is no time for
such thoughts. Who yield? Who push their way?"
8. "The ladders are thrown down," replied Rebecca, shuddering; "the soldiers lie groveling under them like crushed
reptiles; the besieged have the better." " Saint George
strike for us!" said the knight, "do the false yeomen give
way?"  "No," exclaimed Rebecca, "they bear themselves
right yeomanly; the Black Knight approaches the postern
with his huge ax; the thundering blows which he deals, you
may hear them above all the din and shouts of the battle;
stones and beams are hailed down on the brave champion;
he regards them no more than if they were thistle-down and
feathers."
9. "St. John of Acre!" said Ivanhoe, raising himself
joyfully on his couch, "'methought there was but one man
in England that might do such a deed." "The postern gate
shakes," continued Rebecca; "it crashes-it is splintered byhis powerful blows-they rush in-the out-work is won-oh
God! they hurry the defenders from the battlements-they
throw them into the moat-O men, if ye be indeed men,
spare them  that can resist no longer!  "The bridge-the
bridge which communicates with the castle-have they won
that pass?" exclaimed Ivanhoe.  "No," replied Rebecca;
"the Templar has destroyed the plank on which they crossed
-few of the defenders escaped with him into the castle-the
shrieks and cries which you hear, tell the fate of the others.
Alas! I see that it is still more difficult to look upon victory
than upon battle."
10. "What do they now, maiden?" said Ivanhoe; "look
forth yet again, this is no time to faint at bloodshed." "It is
over, for a time," said Rebecca; "our friends strengthen themselves within the out-work which they have mastered." "Our
friends," said Invahoe, "will surely not abandon an enterprise
so gloriously begun, and so happily attained; O no! I will
put my faith in the good knight, whose ax has rent heart-ofoak, and bars of iron. Singular," he again muttered to himself, " if there can be two who are capable of such achievements.
It is, it must be Richard C(EUR de Lion."
11. "Seest thou nothing else, Rebecca, by which the Black
Knight may be distinguished?"  "Nothing," said the Jewess,
"all about him is as black as the wing of the night-raven.
Nothing can I spy that can mark him further; but having
once seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I
could know him again among a thousand warriors. He rushes
to the fray, as if he were summoned to a banquet. There
is more than mere strength; it seems as if the whole soul
and spirit of the champion, were given to every blow which
he deals upon his enemies. God forgive him the sin of bloodshed! it is fearful, yet magnificent to behold, how the arm
and heart of one man can triumph over hundreds."165
LVI.- DESCRIPTION OF A STORM AT SEA.
FROM CARRINGTON.
1. THE evening winds shriek'd wildly: the dark cloud
Rested upon the horizon's hem, and grew
Mightier and mightier, flinging its black arch
Around the troubled offing, till it grasp'd
Within its terrible embrace, the all
That eye could see of ocean. There arose,
Forth from the infinite of waters, sounds
Confused, appalling; from the dread lee-shore
There came a heavier swell, a lengthen'd roar,
Each moment deeper, rolling on the ear
With most portentous voice. Rock howl'd to rock,
Headland to headland, as the Atlantic flung
Its billows shoreward; and the feathery foam
Of twice ten thousand broken surges, sail'd
High o'er the dim-seen land. The startled gull,
With scream prophetic, sought his savage cliff,
And e'en the bird that loves to sail between
The ridges of the sea, with hurried wing,
Flew from the blast's fierce onset.
2.           One-far off,One hapless ship was seen upon the deep,
Breasting the western waters. Nothing liv'd
Around her; all was desert; for the storm
Had made old ocean's realm a solitude,
Where man might fear to roam., And there she sat,
A lonely thing amid the gathering strife,
With pinions folded-not for rest,--prepared
To struggle with the tempest.
3.           And it came,
As night abruptly closed; nor moon nor star
Look'd from the sky, but darkness deep as that
Which reign'd over primeval chaos, wrapp'd
That fated bark, save when the lightning hiss'd
Along the bursting billow. Ocean howl'd
To the high thunder, and the thunder spoke
To the rebellious ocean, with a voice
So terrible, that all the rush and roar
Of waves were but as the meek lapse of rills,
To that deep, everlasting peal, which comes
From thee, Niagara, wild flinging o'er
Thy steep the waters of a world.13

4.          Anon,
The lightnings glared more fiercely, burning round
The glowing offing with. unwonted stay,
As if they linger'd o'er the darkbyss,
And rais'd its vail of horror, but to show
Its wild and tortured face. And then, the winds
Held oft a momentary pause,
As spent with their own fury; but they came
Again with added power; with shriek and cry,
Almost unearthly, as if on their wings,
Pass'd by the spirit of the storm.
5.          They heard,
Who rode the midnight mountain-wave; the voice
Of death was in that cry unearthly. Oft,
In the red battle had they seen him stride
The glowing deck, scattering his burning hail,
And breathing liquid flame, until the winds,
The very winds grew faint, and on the waves
Rested the columned smokes; but on that night
He came with tenfold terrors; with a power
That shook at once heaven, earth; his ministers
Of vengeance round him, the great wind, the sea,
The thunder, and the fatal flash! Alas!
Day dawn'd not on the mariner; ere morn,
The lightning lit the seaman to his grave,
And the fierce sea-dog feasted on the dead!
LVII. - LIFE, A MIGHTY RIVER.
FROM HEBER.
REGINALD HEBER, late Bishop of Calcutta, was born in 1783, and
died suddenly at Trichinopoli, in 1826. Heber is truly a Christian
poet, and a spirit of affectionate piety pervades all his writings.
1. LIFE bears us on, like the current of a mighty river.
Our boat, at first, glides down the narrow channel, through
the playful murmurings of the little brook, and the windings
of its happy border. The trees shed their blossoms over
our young heads; the flowers on the brink seem  to offer
themselves to our hands; we are happy in hope, and we
grasp eagerly at the beauties around us; but the stream
hurries us on, and still our hands are empty.167
2. Our course in youth and manhood is along a wider and
deeper flood, and amid objects more striking and magnificent.
We are animated by the moving picture of enjoyment and
industry which passel before us; we are excited by some
short-lived success, or depressed and made miserable by
some equally short-lived disappointment. But our energy
and our dependence are both in vain. The stream bears us
on, and our joys and our griefs are alike left behind us; we
may be shipwrecked, but we can not anchor; our voyage
may be hastened, but it can not be delayed; whether rough
or smooth, the river hastens toward its home, till the roaring
of the ocean is in our ears, and the tossing of the waves is
beneath our keel, and the land lessens from our eyes, and
the floods are lifted up around us, and we take our last leave
of the earth, and its inhabitants; and of our further voyage
there is no witness but the Infinite and Eternal.
3. And do we still take so much anxious thought for
future days, when the days which have gone by have so
strangely and so uniformly deceived us? Can we still so set
our hearts-on the creatures of God, when we find, by sad
experience, that the Creator only is permanent?  Or shall
we not rather lay aside every weight, and every sin which
doth most easily beset us, and think ourselves henceforth as
wayfaring persons only, who have no abiding inheritance but
in the hope of a better world, and to whom even that world
would be worse than hopeless, if it were not for our Lord
Jesus Christ, and the interest we have obtained in his mercies?
LVIII. - THE FAMILY MEETING.
FROM SPRAGUE.
CHARLES SPRAGUE was born in Boston in 1791, and was a son of one of
the veterans of the Boston Tea-tax Memory. In his leisure moments he
has written some admirable poems, among which are Curiosity, Shakspeara
Ode, Centennial Ode, The Winged Worshipers, The Family ]ieetinlg, etc.
We are all here'!
Father', mother',
Sister-, brother-,
All who hold each other dear.
Each chair is fill'd': we're all at home":To-night, let no cold stranger come-:
It is not often thus around
Our old familiar hearth we're found-:
Bless then the meeting and the spot';
For once, be every care forgot';
Let gentle Peace assert her power,
And kind Affection rule the hour'-;
We're all'--all' here.
2.       We're not' all here!
Some are away'-- the dead' ones dear,
Who throng'd with us this ancient hearth,
And gave the hour to guiltless mirth.
Fate, with a stern relentless hand,
Look'd in and thinn'd our little band"-:
Some', like a night-flash, pass'd away"',
And some' sank lingering day by day"-;
The quiet grave-yard'--some' lie there"--
And cruel Ocean has his" share:
We're not" all here.
3.      We are" all here!
Even they', the dead"--though dead', so dear,
Fond Memory, to her duty true,
Brings back their" faded forms to view.
How life-like through the mist of years,
Each well-remember'd face appears"!
We see them as in times long past,
From each to each kind looks are cast;
We hear their words", their smiles" behold,
They're round us, as they were of old"--
We are' all here.
4.      We are all here'!
Father', mother',
Sister', brother`,
You that I love with love so dear-.
This may not long of us be said;
Soon must we join the gather'd dead,
And by the hearth we now sit round,
Some other circle will be found.
Oh! then, that wisdom may we know,
Which yields a life of peace below:
So, in the world to follow this,
May each repeat, in words of bliss,
We're all"- all'--here"!169
LIX.- A VIEW OF THE COLISEUM.
FROM DEWEY.
COLISEUM; (pro. Col-i-se/-um), the ruins of an ancient building at
Rome.
1. ON the eighth of November, from the highland, about
fourteen miles distant, I first saw Rome'-; and although there
is something very unfavorable to impression in the expectation that you are to be greatly impressed, or that you oughtto be, or that such is the fashion'; yet Rome is too mighty a
name to be withstood by such or any other" influences.  Let
you come upon that hill in what mood you may", the scene
will lay hold upon you as with the hand of a giant. I
scarcely know how to describe' the impression, but it seemed
to me, as if something strong and stately, like the slow and
majestic march of a mighty whirlwind, swept around those
eternal towers'; the storms of time, that had prostrated the
proudest monuments of the worldt, seemed to have left their
vibrations in the still and solemn air'; ages of history passed
before me; the mighty procession of nations", kings&gt;, consuls, emperors', empires-, and generations, had passed over
that sublime theater. The fire, the storm, the earthquake,
had gone by'; but there was yet left the still small voice like
that, at which the prophet "wrapped his face in his mantle. "
2. I went to see the Coliseum by moonlight. It is the
monarch, the majesty of all ruins'; there is nothing like" it.
All the associations of the place, too, give it the most impressive character. When you enter within this stupendous circle
of ruinous walls and arches, and grand terraces of masonry,
rising one above another, you stand upon the arena of the
old gladiatorial combats and Christian martyrdom"; and as
you lift your eyes to the vast amphitheater, you meet, in
imagination, the eyes of a hundred thousand Romans, assembled to witness these bloody spectacles. What a multitude
and mighty array of human beings"; and how little do we
know in modern times of great assemblies`!  One, two, and
three, and at its last enlargement by Constantine, moire than
three hundred thousand persons could be seated in the Circus
Maximus!
15NEW SIXTH READER.
3. But to return to the Coliseum'; we went up under the
conduct of a guide, upon the walls and terraces, or embankments which supported the ranges of seats. The seats have
long since disappeared'; and grass overgrows the spots where
the pride, and power, and wealth, and beauty of Rome sat
down to its barbarous entertainments. What thronging life
was here then'! What voices, what greetings', what hurrying footsteps upon the staircases of the eighty acres of entrance! and now, as we picked our way carefully through
the decayed passages, or cautiously ascended some moldering
flight of steps, or stood by the lonely walls-ourselves silent,
and, for a wonder, the guide silent, too-there was no sound
here but of the bat, and none came from without, but the
roll of a distant carriage or the convent bell from the summit
of the neighboring Esquiline.
4. It is scarcely possible to describe the effect of moonlight
upon this ruin.  Through a hundred lonely arches, and
blackened passage-ways, it streamed in, pure, bright, soft,
lambent, and yet distinct and clear, as if it came there at
once to reveal, and cheer, and pity the mighty desolation.
But if the Coliseum is a mournful and desolate spectacle as
seen from within-without, and especially on the side which
is in best- preservation, it is glorious. We passed around' it;
and, as we looked upward, the moon shining through its
arches, from the opposite side, it appeared as if it were the
coronet of the heavens', so vast' was it-or like a glorious
crown upon the brow of night.
5. I feel that I do not and can not describe this mighty
ruin. I can'only say that I came away paralyzed, and as
passive as a child. A soldier stretched out his hand for " unt
dono," as we passed the guard'; and when my companion
said I did wrong to give, I told him that I should have given
my cloak', if the man had asked' it. Would you break any
spell that worldly feeling or selfish sorrow may have spread
over your mind, go and see the Coliseum by moonlight.LX.- ON MODULATION.
FROM LLOYD.
1.'T Is not enough the voice- be sound and clear",'T is modulation' that must charm the ear.
When desperate heroes grieve with tedious mloan,
And whine their sorrows in a see-saw tone,
The same soft sounds of unimpassion'd woes,
Can only make the yawning hearers doze.
The voice all modes of passion can express,
That mark the proper word with proper stress:
But none emphatic can that speaker call,
Who lays an equal emphasis on all.
2. Some o'er the tongue the labor'd measure roll,
Slow and deliberate as the parting toll;
Point every stop, mark every pause so strong,
Their words like stage processions stalk along.
3 All affectation but creates disgust;
And e'en in speaking, we may seem too just.
In vain for them'- the pleasing measure flows,
Whose recitation runs it all to prose;
Repeating what the poet sets not down,
The verb disjointing from its favorite noun,
While pause, and break, and repetition join
To make a discord in each tuneful line'.
4. Some' placid natures fill the allotted scene
With lifeless drawls, insipid and serene;
While others' thunder every couplet o'er,
And almost crack your ears with rant and roar;
More nature oft, and finer strokes are shown
In the low whisper, than tempestuous tone;
And Hamlet's hollow voice and fix'd amaze,
More powerfiul terror to the mind conveys,
Than he, who, swollen with impetuous rage,
Bullies the bulky phantom- of the stage.
5 He who, in earnest, studies o'er his part,
Will find true nature cling about his heart.
The modes of grief are not included all
In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl:
A single look"s more marks the internal woe,
Than all the windings of the lengthen'd Oh'sUp to the face the quick sensation flies,
And darts its meaning from the speaking eyes:
Love', transport", madness", anger'-, scorn', despair';
And all the passions-, all the soul is there.
LXI. - COMBAT AT A TOURNAMENT.
FROM WALTER SCOTT.
TOURNAMENT; (pro. turn-a-ment). Formerly, when the chief business
of mankind was war, it was customary for knights to try their courage
and skill, in mock-fights, armed with their usual weapons, the lance
and sword. When several knights were engaged it was called a
tournament; when but two, a joust.
The challenge to combat was given, by touching the shield -of the.
knight whom the challenger wished to encounter. The challenge to
a contest with headless or blunt lances, was given by touching the
shield gently with the reversed spear, while a blozw with the point denoted a challenge to mortal conflict.
List; the enclosure within which the tournaments were held.
Bois Guilbert; pro. Bwah-Guil-bare.
Grammercy; many thanks.
1. *  *  * THE music of the challengers breathed, from
time to time, wild bursts, expressive of triumph or defiance;
while the clowns grudged a holiday which seemed to pass
away in inactivity; and old knights and nobles lamented the
decay of martial spirit, and spoke of the triumphs of their
younger days.  Prince John began to talk to his attendants
about making ready the banquet, and the necessity of adjudging the prize to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had, with.a
single spear, overthrown two knights, and foiled a third.
2. At length, as the music of the challengers concluded
one of'those long and high flourishes with which they had
broken the silence of the lists, it was answered by a solitary
trumpet, which breathed a note of defiance, from the northern
extremity. All eyes' were turned to see the new champion
which these sounds announced, and no sooner were the barriers opened than he paced into the lists.
3. As far as could be judged of a man sheathed in armor,
the new adventurer did not greatly exceed the middle size,
and seemned to be rather slender than strongly made. His
suit of armor was formed of steel, richly inlaid with gold;and the device on his shield was a young oak-tree pulled
up by the roots, with the single word "Disinherited." He
was mounted on a gallant black horse, and as he passed
through the lists, he gracefully saluted the prince and the
ladies, by lowering his lance. The dexterity with which he
managed his steed, and something of youthful grace which
he displayed in his manner, won him the favor of the multitude, which some of the lower classes expressed by calling
out, "Touch Ralph de Vipont's shield, touch the Hospitaller's shield; he has the least, sure seat; he is your cheapest
bargain.". 4. The champion moving onward amid the well-meant
hints, ascended the platform by the sloping alley which led
to, it from the lists, and, to the astonishment of all present,
riding straight up to the central pavilion, struck with the
sharp end of his spear the shield of Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
until it rang again. All stood astonished at his presumption, but none more so than the redoubted knight whom he
had thus defied to mortal combat, and who, little expecting
so rude a challenge, was standing carelessly at the door of his
-pavilion.
5. "Have you confessed yourself, brother," said the Templar, Guilbert, "and have you heard mass this morning,
that you peril your life so frankly?"  "I am fitter to meet
death than thou art,'' answered the Disinherited Knight; for
by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the book
of the tourney. "Then take your place in the lists," said
De Bois-Guilbert, "and look your last upon the sun; for
this night thou shalt sleep in paradise."  "Grammercy for
thy courtesy," replied the Disinherited Knight, "and to re-.quite it, I advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance,
for, by my honor, you will need both."
6. Having expressed himself thus confidently, he reined
his horse backward down the slope which he had ascended,
and compelled him in the same manner to move backward
through the lists, till he reached the northern extremity,
where he remained stationary, in expectation of his antagonist. This feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of the multitude.
7s However incensed at his adversary for the precautionwhich he recommended, the Templar did not neglect his advice; for his honor was too nearly concerned to permit his
neglecting any means which might insure victory over his
presumptuous opponent. He changed his horse for a proved
and fresh one of great strength and spirit. He chose a new
and tough spear, lest the wood of the former might have
been strained in the previous encounters he had sustained.
Lastly, he laid aside his shield, which had received some little
damage, and received another from his squires.
8. When the two champions stood opposed to each other
at the two extremities of the lists, the public expectation
was strained to the highest pitch. Few augured the possibility that the encounter could terminate well for the Disinherited Knight, yet his courage and gallantry secured the
general good wishes of the spectators. The trumpets had
no sooner given the signal, than the champions vanished
from their posts with the speed of lightning, and closed in
the center of the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt.
The lances burst into shivers up to the very grasp, and it
seemed, at the moment, that both knights had fallen, for
the shock had made each horse recoil backward upon its
haunches. The address of the riders recovered their steeds
by the use of the bridle and spur; and having glared on
each other, for an instant, with eyes that seemed to flash
fire through the bars of their visors, each retired to the
extremity of the lists, and received a fresh lance from the
attendants.
9. A loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs
and handkerchiefs, and general acclamations, attested the
interest taken in the encounter.  But no sooner had the
knights resumed their station, than the clamor of applause
was hushed into a silence so deep and so dead, that it
seemed the multitude were afraid to breathe. A few minutes'
pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their
horses might recover breath, the trumpets again sounded the
onset. The champions a second time sprung from  their stations, and met in the center of the lists, with the same speed,
the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same equal
fortune as before.
10. In the second encounter, the Templar aimed at the175
center of his antagonist's shield, and struck it so fairly and
forcibly, that his spear went to shivers, and the Disinherited
Knight reeled in his saddle. On the other hand, the champion had, in the beginning of his career, directed the point
of his lance toward Bois-Guilbert's shield; but changing his
aim almost in the moment of encounter, he addressed to the
helmet, a mark more difficult to hit, but which, if attained,
rendered the shock more irresistible. Fair and true he hit
the Templar on the visor, where his lance's point kept hold
of the bars.  Yet even at this disadvantage, Bois-Guilbert
sustained his high reputation; and had not the girths of his
saddle burst, he might not have been unhorsed.   As it
chanced, however, saddle, horse, and man, rolled on the
ground under a cloud of dust.
11. To extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed,
was to the Templar scarce the work of a moment; and stung
with madness, both at his disgrace, and the acclamations by
which it was hailed by the spectators, he drew his sword, and
waved it in defiance of his conqueror.   The Disinherited
Knight sprung from his steed', and also unsheathed his
sword'.  The marshals of the field, however, spurred their
horses between' them, and,reminded them that the laws of
the tournament did not, on the present occasion, permit
this species of encounter", but that to the " Disinherited Knight'" the meed of victory was fairly and honorably
awarded.
LXII. - THE BANNER OF PULASKI.

PULASKI was a Polish officer who took part with the Americans, and fell
at the taking of Savannah, during the American Revolution. His standard
of crimson silk was presented to him by the Moravians of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and it becan,e his shroud.

That proud banner, which, with prayer,
Had been consecrated there;
And the nun's sweet hymn was heard the while,
Sung low in the dim, mysterious aisle.
2. "Take thy banner'!-- may it wave
Proudly o'er the good and brave,
When the battle's distant wail
Breaks the sabbath of our vale,
When the clarion's music thrills
To the heart of these lone hills,
When the spear in conflict shakes,
And the strong lance shivering breaks.
3. Take thy banner!-and beneath
The war-cloud's encircling wreath,
Guard it --till our homes are free;
Guard' it- God will prosper thee.
In the dark and trying hour,
In the breaking forth of power,
In the rush of steeds and men,
His right hand will shield thee then.
4. Take thy banner'! But when night
Closes round the ghastly fight,
If the vanquish'd warrior bow,
Spare' him! -by our holy vow,
By our prayers and many tears,
By the mercy that endears,
Spare- him!- he our love hath shared,
Spare' him! - as thou wouldst be spared.
5. Take thy banner!- and if e'er
Thou shouldst press the soldier's bier,
And the muffled drum should beat
To the tread of mournful feet,
Then this crimson flag shall be
Martial cloak and shroud for thee."
And the warrior took that banner proud',
And it was his martial cloak and shroud.

LXIII.- THE DOWNFALL OF POLAND.
FROM CAMPBELL.
THOMAS CAMPBELL is the most classical poet of the present century, and
there are few modern bards whose works are more likely to be ranked
among the standard classics of the language. He died in 1845.
Pandoors; Hungarian soldiers.
Hussars; Hungarian horsemen.
1. OH! sacred Truth! thy triumph ceas'd awhile,
And Hope, thy sister, ceas'd with thee to smile,
When leagued oppression pour'd to northern wars
Her whisker'd pandoors and her fierce hussars,
Waved her dread standard to the breeze of morn,
Peal'd her loud drum, and twang'd her trumpet horn;
Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,
Presaging wrath to Poland,-and to man!
2. Warsaw's last champion, from her hights survey'd,
Wide o'er the fields, a waste of ruin laid;
Oh! heaven!" he cried, "my bleeding country save!
Is there no hand on high to shield the brave?
Yet, though destruction sweep these lovely plains,
Rise'! fellow-men! our country' yet remains I'By that dread name we wave the sword on high`,
And swear for her-to live-with her-to die!"
3. (1) He said', and on the rampart-hights array'd
His trusty warriors, few, but undismay'd;
Firm-paced and slow, a horrid front they form,
Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm;
Low murmuring sounds along their banners fly,
Revenge, or death,-the watch-word' and reply';
Then peal'd the notes, omnipotent to charm,
And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm.
4. In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few!
From rank to rank, your volley'd thunder flew!
Oh bloodiest picture in the book of time,
Sarmatia fell", unwept, without a crime;
Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,
Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe!
Dropp'd from her nerveless grasp the shatter'd spear,
Closed her bright eye, and curb'd her high career;
Hlope, for a season, bade the world farewell,
And freedomri shriek'd-as Kosciusko fell!5. The sun went down'-, nor ceas'd the carnage there",
Tumultuous murder shook the midnight air;
On Prague's proud arch the fires of ruin glow,
His blood-dyed waters murmuring far below;
The storm prevails'-, the rampart yields away,
Bursts the wild cry of horror and dismay!
Hark'`! as the smoldering piles with thunder fall,
A thousand shrieks for hopeless mercy call!
Earth shook, red meteors fiash'd along the sky,
And conscious Nature shudder'd at the cry!
6. (h) Oh righteous heaven! ere Freedom found a grave,
Why slept the sword, omnipotent to save?
Where was thine- arm, 0 Vengeance! where thy rod,
That smote the foes of Zion and of God?
That crush'd proud Ammon, when his iron car
Was yoked in wrath, and thunder'd from afar?
Where was the storm that slumber'd till the host
Of blood-stain'd Pharaoh left their trembling coast;
Then, bade the deep in wild commotion flow,
And heav'd an ocean on their march below?
7. Departed spirits of the mighty dead-!
Ye that at Marathon and Leuctra bled'!
Friends of the world-! restore your swords to man,
Fight in his sacred cause and lead the van!

LXIV. - SOUTH CAROLINA.
FROM HAYNE.
MR. HAYNE was a Senator in Congress from the state of South
Carolina. This is an extract from a speech delivered by him while
a member of that body.
1. IF there be one state in the Union, Mr. President, that
may challenge comparison with any other, for a uniform,
zealous, ardent, and uncalculating devotion to the Union',
that state is South Carolina'.  Sir', from the very commencement of the revolution', up to this hour-, there is no sacri179
fice, however great, she has not cheerfully made'; no service
she has ever hesitated to performi.
2. She has adhered to you in your prosperity'; but in
your adversity', she has clung to you with more than filial.
affection". No matter what was the condition of her domestic affairs; though deprived of her resources', divided by
parties', or surrounded by difficulties', the call.of the
country has been to her as the voice of God'. Domestic
discord ceased at the sound'; every man became at once
reconciled to his brethren', and the sons of Carolina were
all seen, crowding together to the temple, bringing their
gifts to the altar of their common country'.
3. What, sir, was the conduct of the South, during the
revolution? Sir, I honor New England, for her conduct in
that glorious struggle. But great as is the praise which
belongs to her', I think at least, equal honor is due to the
South. Nrever' were there exhibited, in the history of the
world', higher examples of noble daring', dreadful suffering', and heroic endurance', than by the whigs of Carolina,
during the revolution'.  The whole state, from the mountains to the sea, was overrun by an overwhelming force of
the enemy.  The fruits of industry perished on the spot
where they were produced, or were consumed by the foe.
4. " The plains of Carolina" drank up the most precious
blood of her citizens. Black, smoking ruins marked the
places which had been the habitation of her children.
Driven from their homes into the gloomy and almost impenetrable swamps, even there-, the spirit of liberty survived',
and South Carolina, sustained by the example of her Sumpters' and her Marions', proved, by her conduct, that though
her soil' might be overrun, the spirit of her people' was
invincible.NEW  SIXTH READER.
LXV. - MASSACHUSETTS AND SOUTH CAROLINA.
FROM DANIEL WEBSTER.
DANIEL WEBSTER was born in 1782. He graduated at the age of
twenty, and established himself in the practice of the law in New
Hampshire. He became a member of Congress at the age of thirty,
in which'he continued, with few intermissions, until his death, holding the foremost rank as an orator, statesman, and expounder of the
Constitution. This is an extract from his answer to the preceding
speech. He died a few years ago.
1. THE  eulogium  pronounced on the character of the
State of South Carolina, by the honorable gentleman, for her
revolutionary and other merits, meets my hearty concurrence.
I shall not acknowledge that the honorable member goes
before me, in regard for whatever of distinguished talent or
distinguished character, South Carolina has produced. I
claim part of the honor; I partake in the pride of her great
names. I claim them for countrymen-, one" and all'--the
Laurenses', the Rutledges', the Pinckneys', the Sumpters",
the Marions'--Americans all'--whose fame is no more to
be hemmed in by state lines, than their talents and patriotism were capable of being circumscribed within the same
narrow limits.
2. In their day and generation, they served and honored
the country, and the whole' country, and their renown is of
the treasures' of the whole country. Hiim', whose honored
name the gentleman himself'- bears,-does he suppose me less
capable of gratitude for his' patriotism, or sympathy for his"
suffering, than if his eyes had first opened upon the light in
Massachusetts, instead of South Carolina"!  Sir, does he
suppose it in his power to exhibit in Carolina a name so
bright as to produce envy in my bosom,?   No, sir,-increased gratification' and delightC rather.  Sir, I thank God&gt;,
that, if I am gifted with little of the spirit which is said to
be able to raise mortals' to the skies", I have yet none', as
I trust, of that other" spirit, which would drag angels"
down'.
3. When I shall be found, sir, in my place here in the
senate, or elsewhere, to sneer at public merit, because it
happened to spring up beyond the little limits of my own'ECLECTIC SERIES.
state or neighborhood; when I refuse for any such cause, or
for any'" cause, the homage due to American talent, to elevated patriotism, to sincere devotion to liberty and the
country'; or if I see an uncommon endowment of Heaven";
if I see extraordinary capacity or virtue in any son of the
South'; and if, moved by local prejudice', or gangrened by
state jealousy", I get up here to abate a tithe of a hair' from
his just character and just fame', may my tongue cleave
to the r55f of my mouth.
4. Mr. President, I shall enter on no encomium  upon
Massachusetts.  She needs' none.  There she is'; behold
her, and judge for yourselves.  There is her history"; the
world knows it by heart. The past', at least, is secure'.
There is Boston', and Concord', and Lexington', and Bunker-hill"'; and there they will remain forever". And, sir,
where American liberty rai'ed its first voice, and where its
youth was nurtured and sustained', there it still lives', in
the strength of its manhood, and full of its original spirit.
If discord and disunion shall wound' it; if party strife and
blind ambition shall hawk at and tear it; if folly and madness, if uneasiness under salutary restraint', shall succeed to
separate it from that Union', by which alone its existence
is made sure', it will stand, in the end, by the side of that
cradle in which its infancy was rocked'; it will stretch forth
its arm with whatever of vigor it may'still retain, over the
friends who gathered around it; and it will fall at last, if
fall it must', amid the proudest monuments of its glory,
and on the very spot of its origin.
LXVI. -THE LAST DAYS OF HERCULANEUM.
FROM ATHERSTONE.
HERCULANEUM and Pompeii were cities of Italy, which were destroyed by
an eruption of Vesuvius, being entirely buried under ashes and lava. During the last century they have been dug out, to a considerable extent,
and the streets, and buildings, and utensils have been found in a state of
perfect preservation.
1.     THERE was a man',
A Roman soldier, for some daring deed
That trespass'd on the laws, in dungeon lowNEW SIXTH READER.
Chain'd down. His was a noble spirit, rough,
But generous, and brave, and kind.
He had a son'; it was a rosy boy,
A little faithful copy of his sire,
In face and gesture. From infancy, the child
Ilad been his father's solace and his care.
2.    Every sport
The father shared.and highten'd. But at length,
The rigorous law had grasp'd him, and condemn'd
To fetters and to darkness.
3.    The captive's lot,
He felt in all its bitterness: the walls
Of his deep dungeon answer'd many a sigh
And heart-heav'd groan. His tale was known, and touch'd
His jailer with compassion"-; and the boy,
Thenceforth a frequent visitor, beguiled
IIis father's lingering hours, and brought a balm
With his lov'd presence, that in every wound
Dropp'd healing. But, in this terrific hour,
He was a poison'd arrow' in the breast
Where he had been a cure.
4. -   With earliest morn
Of that first day of darkness and amaze,
He came. The iron door was closed', - for them
Never to open more! The day'; the night'
Dragg'd slowly by'; nor did they know the fate
Impending o'er the city. Well they heard
The pent-up thunders in the earth beneath,
And felt its giddy rocking; and the air
Grew hot" at length, and thick'-; but in his straw
The boy was sleeping': and the father hoped
The earthquake might pass by': nor would he wake
From his sound rest the unfearing child, nor tell
The dangers of their state.
5.    (1) On his low couch
The fetter'd soldier sank, and with deep awe,
Listen'd the fearful sounds': with upturn'd eye,
To the great gods he breath'd a prayer; then, strove
To calm himself, and lose in sleep' awhile
His useless terrors. But he could' not sleep:
His body burn'd with feverish heat'; his chains
Clank'd loud, although he moved not-; deep in earth183
Groan'd unimaginable thunders"'; sounds,
Fearful and ominous, arose and died',
Like the sad mSanings of November's wind,
In the blank midnight. (11) Deepest horror chill'd
His bl5od that buarn'd bef5re; cold, clammy sweats
Came 5'er him i then anon, a fiery thrill
Shot through his veins. Now, on his couch he shrunk,
And shiver'd as in fear'; now, upright leap'd,
As though he heard the battle trumpet sound,
And long'd to cope with death.
6.     He slept", at last,
A troubled, dreamy sleep. WVll had he slept
Never to waken more! His hours are few,
But terrible his agony.
Soon the storm
Burst forth; the lightenings glanced'; the air
S/ook" with the thunders. They awoke"; they sprung,
Amazed upon their feet'. The dungeon glowed
A moment as in sunshine - and was dark:
Again, a flood of white flame fills the cell,
Dying away upon the dazzled eye
In darkening, quivering tints, as stunning sound"
Dies throbbing, ringing in the ear.
8.   VWith intensest awe,
The soldier's frame was fill'd'; and many a thought
Of strange foreboding hurried through his mind,
As underneath he felt the fever'd earth
Jarring and lifting"; and the massive walls,
Heard harshly grate and strain": yet knew he not,
While evils undefined and yet to come
Glanced through his thoughts, what deep and cureless wound
Fate had already" given. - Where', man of woe'!
Where', wretched father'! is thy boy"? Thou call'st
IIis name in vain":  he can not answer" thee.
9. Loudly the father call'd upon his child': -
No voice replied". Trembling and anxiously
He search'd their couch of straw-; with headlong haste
Trod round his stinted limits, and, low bent,
Groped darkling on the earth': - no child was there.
(h) Again' he called: again', at farthest stretch
Of his accurs-ed fetters, till the blood
Seemed bursting from his ears, and from his eyesFire flash'd, he strain'd with arm extended far,
And fingers widely spread, greedy to touch
Though but his idol's garment.  Useless toil'!
Yet still renew'd': still round and round he goes,
And strains', and snatches', and with dreadful cries
Calls' on his boy.
10.      (hh) Madfrenzy fires him now:
lie plants against the wall his feet'; his chain
Grasps'; tugs' with giant strength to force away
The deep-driven staple'; yells' and shrieks with rage:
And, like a desert lion in the snare,
Raging to break his toils,-to and fro bounds'.
But see! the ground is opening';--a blue light
Mounts, gently waving',-noiseless;-thin and cold
It seems, and like a rainbow' tint, not flame;
But by its luster, on the earth outstretch'd,
Behold the lifeless child! his dress is singed,
And, o'er his face serene, a darken'd line
Points out the lightning's track.
11.      (II) The father saw,
And all his fury fied':-a dead calm fell
That instant on him:-speechless--'fix'd--he stood';
And with a look that never wander'd', gazed
Intensely on the corse'. Those laughing eyes-'
Were not yet closed',--and round those ruby lips'
The wonted smile return'd'.
12.        Silent and pale
The father stands':-no tear is in his eye-:--
The thunders bellow';-but he hears them not':The ground lifts like a sea'; he knowus' it not':The strong walls grind and gape':-the vaulted roof
Takes shape like bubble tossing in the wind';
See! he looks up and smiles';--for death to him
Is happiness'.  Yet could one last embrace
Be given','t were still a sweeter' thing to die.
13. It willt be given. (h) Look'! how the rolling ground,
At every swell, nearer and still more near
Moves toward the father's outstretch'd arm his boy:
Once he has touch'd his garment':--how his eye
Lightens with love, and hope, and anxious fears'!
Ha'! see'! he has' him now!-he clasps him round;
Kisses his face; puts back the curling locks,185
That shaded his fine brow; looks in his eyes;
Grasps'" in his own those little dimpled hands';
Then folds him to his breast, as he was wont
To lie when sleeping; and resigned, awaits
Undreaded death.
14. (II) And death came soon and swift,
And pangless. The hage pile sank down at once
Into the 5pening earth. Walls-arches'--roof'--
And deep foundatio,n stones-all--mlngling-fell"!

Count Rosencrantz. Do you think I am so far deceived' in

1st. Capt. D. Believe it, my lord.  To my certain knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as gently as if

and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, and the owner
of no one good quality worthy your lordship's respect.

might, on some important occasion, in some pressing danger,
fail you.

him.

hour, I will tell true. Let me see'; Spurio', a hundred and
fifty'; Sebastian', so many&gt;; Corambus', so many"; Cosmo',
Lodovick', and Grati-, two hundred and fifty each&gt;; mine

life, amounts not to fifteen thousand full; half of whichNEW SIXTH READER.
dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks, lest they
shake themselves' to pieces.
Count R. What shall be done-' to him?
1st Capt D. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand
of him my character, and what credit I have with the
Duke?
1st. Sold. Well, that's' set down.  [Reading from a note.]
You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain"- be
in the camp: what his reputation is with the Duke', what his
valor, honesty, expertness in wars'; or whether he thinks it
were possible, with well-weighed sums of gold, to corrupt hint
to a revolt. What say you to this'?  What do you know' of it.
Del. I beseech you let me answer to the particulars.  Demand them singly.
1st Sold. Do you know' this Captain Dumain?
Del. I know' him.  He was a butcher's apprentice in
Paris, from whence he was whipped for some paltry theft.
[Dumain lifts up his hand to strike hinm.
Count R. Nay&gt;, by your leave, hold your hands; though
I know, his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
-st Sold. Well', is this captain in the Duke's camp?
Del. Upon my knowledge he is', and a mean, dirty villain.
1st Capt D. [To Count R.] Nay', look not so upon me';
we shall hear of your lordship'2 anon.
1st Sold. What is his reputation with the Duke?
Del. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
of mine"; and writ to me this other day, to turn him out
o' the band. I think I have his letter in my pocket.
1st SJlcd. Marry, we'11 search.
De7. In good sadness, I do not know': either it is there,
or it is upon file&gt;, with the Duke's other letters, in my tent.
1st Sold. Here't is'; here's a paper; shall I read it you?
Del. I do not know&gt;' if it be it, or no.
Count R. Our interpreter does it well.
1st Capt D. Excellently.
1st Sold. [Readts.] The count's a.fool and full of gold.
Del. That's" not the Duke's letter, sir; that is a notice to
a certain person to take heed of one Count Rozencrantz", a
foolish, idle boy'; for all that, very knavish. Pray you, sir,
put it up' again.lst Sold. Nay, I'11 read' it first, by your favor.
[Reading.] When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
After he scores, he never pays' the score:
Half won is match well made'; match, and well make' it.
He ne'er pays after- debts, take it befbre.
For count of this, the count's a fool", I knowu it,
Who pays before, but not when he does owe" it.
Count R. He shall be whipped through the army, with
these rhymes on his forehead.
2d Capt. D. This is your devoted friend., the learned linguist, and the gallant soldier.
t Count R. I could endure any thing before but a cat, and
now he's a cat- to me.
1st Sold. I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall
-be fain to hangs` you.
Del. My life&gt;, in any" case: not that I am afrdid to die;
but that my offenses being many, I would repent out the
remainder of my nature. Let me live', sir, in a dungeon&gt;,
in the stocks&gt;, or any where, so I may live.
1st Sold. We'll see what may be done, so you confess'
freely; therefore once more to this Captain Dumain. You
have answered to his reputation with the Duke', and to his
valor. What, his honesty?
Del. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister.  He pretends not to keep oaths; but in breaking them is stronger
than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such volubility', that
you would think truth were a fool"; drunkenness is his best
virtue". I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty:
he has every thinLg' that an honest man should not" have; what
an honest man should" have, he has nothing'.
Count R. Hang him. He is more and more a cat.
1st Sold. His qualities being at this poor price, I need
not ask you if gold will' corrupt him to revolt.
Del. Sir, for the fourth part of a French crown, he will
sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and
cut the entail from all remainder.
lst Sold. JVhat's his brother&gt;, the other' Captain Dumain?
2d Capt. D. Why does he ask of me?
Ist Sold. What's he?
17Del. E'en a crow  of the same nest'; not altogether so
great as the other in goodness, but greater a great deal in
evil. I-Ie excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is
reputed one of the best that is: in a retreat, he outruns a
lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.
1st Sold. If your life is saved, will you undertake  to
betray your friends?
Del. Ay, the Captain'of their horse, Count Rozencrantz,
and all"- of them.
1st Sold. I'll whisper with the general and know his
pleasure.
Del. I'll no more drumming"; a plague' of all drums.
Only to seem to deserve well, and to get the good opinion of
that foolish young boy, the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was
taken?                                              [Aside.
1st. Sold. There is no remedy, sir', but you must die'.
The general says, you', that have so traitorously discovered
the secrets of your army, and made such villainous reports of
men in high estimation', can serve the world for no honest use;
therefore you must die.  Come, headsman, off with his head.
Del. 0, sir, let me live-', or let me see' my death!
1st. Sold. That you shall', and take your leave of all your
friends.                                  [ Unmuffin  him.
So', look about' you; know you any here?  
Count R. Good morrow', noble captain.

1st. Capt. D. God save"' you, noble captain.
2d Capt. D. What greeting will you to my lord Lafeu'?
I'm for France.
1st Capt. D. Good captain, will you give me a copy of your
sonnet? If I were not a very c6ward, I'd compel it of you;
but fare-you-well.  [Exeunt Count R., Capt. D. and brother.

Del. Who can not be crushed with a plot?

of you there.:                                      [Exit.

LXVIII. - A PASSAGE IN HUMAN LIFE.
1. IN my daily walks into the country, I was accustomed
to pass a certain cottage. It had nothing particularly picturesque about it. It had its little garden, and its vine
spreading over its front; but, beyond these, it possessed no
feature likely to fix it in the mind of the poet or novel-writer,
and which might induce him to people it with creatures of his
own fancy. In fact, it appeared to be inhabited by persons
as little extraordinary as itself. A " good man of the house"
it might possess,-but he was never visible. The only inmates I ever saw, were a young woman, and another female,
in the wane of life, no doubt the mother.
2. T   damsel was a comely, fresh, mild-looking cottage
girl, a7ways seated in one spot, near the window, intent on
her needle. The old dame was as regularly busied, to and
fro, in household affairs. She appeared one of those good
housewives, who never dream of. rest, except when in sleep.
The cottage stood so near the road, that the fire at the further
end of the room, showed you, without your being rudely inquisitive, the whole interior in a single moment of passing.
A clean hearth and a cheerful fire, shining upon homely, but
neat and orderly furniture, spoke of comfort: but whether
the old dame enjoyed, or merely diffused that comfort, was a
problem.
3. I passed the house many successive days. It was always
alike,-the fire shining brightly and peacefully, the girl
seated at her post by the window,-the housewife going to
and fro, catering and contriving, dusting and managing.
One morning as I went by, there was a change. The dame2. Sounding incorrectly an unaccented vowel.

was seated near her daughter, her arms laid upon the table,;
and her head reclined upon her arms. I was sure that it was
sickness which had compelled her to that action of repose;
nothing less could have done it. I felt that I knew exactly
the poor woman's feelings. She had felt a Weariness stealing
upon her; she had wondered at it, and struggled against it,
and borne up, hoping it would pass by; till, loth as she was
to yield, it had forced submission.
4. The next day, when I passed, the room appeared as
usual; the fire burning pleasantly, the girl at her needle, but
her mother was not to be seen; and, glancing my eye upward,
I perceived the blind close drawn, in the window above. It
is so, said I to myself, disease is in progress. Perhaps it
occasions no gloomy fear of consequences, no extreme concern: and yet, who knows how it may end? It is thus, that
begin those changes that draw out the central bolt that holds
families together; which steal away our fire-side faces, and
lay waste our affections.
5. I passed by, day after day. The scene was the same;
the fire burning, the hearth beaming clear and beautiful; but
the mother was not to be seen; the blind was still drawn
above. At length, I missed the girl, and in her place appeared another woman, bearing considerable resemblance to
the mother, but of a more quiet habit. It was easyinterpret this change. Disease had assumed an alarming aspect;
the daughter was occupied in intense watching and caring
for the suffering mother, and the good woman's sister had
been summoned to her side, perhaps from a distant spot, and,
perhaps, from her family cares, which no less important an
event could have induced her to elude.
6. Thus appearances continued some days.  There was
silence around the house, and an air of, neglect within it,
till, one morning, I beheld the blind drawn, in the room
below, and the window thrown open above. The scene was
over; the mother was removed from her family, and one of
those great changes effected in human life, which commence with so little observation, but leave behind them
such lasting effects.LXIX. -  THANATOPSIS.
FROM BRYANT.
THANATOPSIS is composed of two Greek words, thanatos meaning death,
and opsis a vie7w. The word, therefore, signifies a view of death or "Reflections on Death."
1. To him who, in the love of nature, holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his darker musings, with a mild
And healing sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware.
2.           When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight,
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart,
Go forth under the open sky, and list
To nature's teaching, while from all around,
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air,
Comes a still voice"Yet a few days, and thee,
The all-beholding sun shall see no more
In all his course; nor yet, in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that nourish'd thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolv'd to earth again;
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix forever with the elements,
To be a brother to th' insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his, share and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.
4. Yet not to thy eternal resting place
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie downWith patriarchs of the infant world, with kings,
The powerful of the earth, the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulcher.
5.            The hills,
Rock-ribb'd, and ancient as the sun; the vales,
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods; rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks
That make the meadows green; and, pour'd round all,
Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste,
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages.
6.            All that tread
The globe, are but a handful, to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
Of morning, and the Barcan desert pierce,
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound
Save his own dashings-yet the dead are there;
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep: the dead reign there alone.
7. So shalt thou rest; and what if thou shalt fall
Unnoticed by the living; and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone; the solemn brood of care
Plod on: and each one, as before, will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employmnents, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glides away, the sons of men,
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
The bow'd with age, the infant in the smiles
And beauty of its innocent age cut off,--
Shall, one by one, be gather'd to thy side,
By those who, in their turn, shall follow them.8. So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but sustain'd and sooth'd
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams."
LXX. - THE DEPARTED.
FROM PARK BENJAMIN.
1. THE departed! the departed I
They visit us in dreams,
And they glide above our memories
Like shadows over streams;
But where the cheerful lights of home
In constant luster burn,
The departed, the departed,
Can never more return!
2. The good, the brave, the beautiful,
How dreamless is their sleep,
Where rolls the dirge-like music
Of the ever-tossing deep!
Or where the surging night-winds
Pale winter's robes have spread
Above the narrow palaces,
In the cities of the dead!
3. I look around, and feel the awe
Of one who walks alone,
Among the wrecks of former days,
In mournful ruin strown;
I start to hear the stirring sounds
Among the cypress trees,
For the voice of the departed
Is borne upon the breeze.
4. That solemn voice! it mingles with
Each free and careless strain;
I scarce can think earth's minstrelsy
Will cheer my heart again,NEW  SIXTH READER.
The melody of summer waves,
The thrilling notes of birds,
Can never be so dear to me,
As their remember'd words.
5. I sometimes dream, their pleasant smiles
Still on me sweetly fall,
Their tones of love I faintly hear
My name in sadness call.
I know that they are happy,
With their angel-plumage on,
But my heart is very desolate,
To think that they are gone.
LXXI. - ELIJAH THE TISHBITE.
FROM THE BIBLE.
1. AND Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and
withal, how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let
the Gods do to me&gt;, and more also, if I make not thy- life as
the life of one of themnl, by tomorrow about this time. And
when he saw that-, he arose and went for his lfe&gt;, and came
and sat down under a juniper-tree-, and he requested for
hiinself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O
Lord', take away my life"; for I am not better than my
fathers.
2. And as he lay and slept under a juniper-tree-, behold,
then an angel" touched him, and said unto him, Arise, and
eat! And he looked, and behold, there was a cake baked on
the coals, and a cruse of water at his head.  And he did eat
and drink, and laid him down' again.  And the angel of
the Lord came again the second" time, and touched him, and
said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great' for
thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink&gt;, and went in the
strength of that meat, forty days and forty nights', unto
Horeb, the mount of God.
3. And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged' there;
and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said
unto him, What dost thou here, Elijah-! And he said, I201
have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts'; for the
children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down
thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword': and I,
even I' only, am left-; and they seek my' life, to take it
away.
4. And he said, Go forth and stand upon the mount before
the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by', and a great
and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the
rocks, before the Lord'; but the Lord was not in the wind':
and after the wind an earthquake'; but the Lord was not in
the earthquake': and after the earthquake, a fire': but the
Lord was not in the fire': and after the fire, a still, small
voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle', and went out, and stood in the
entering in of the cave.
5. And behold there came a voice unto him, and said,
What dost thou here', Elijah,?  And he said, I have been
very jealous for the Lord God of hosts'; because the children
of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword'; and Is, even
I', only, am left'; and they seek my life to take it away.
And the Lord said unto him, Go&gt;, return on thy way to the
wilderness of Damascus': and when thou comest, anoint
Hazael to be king over Syria'; and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel'; and Elisha
shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. And it shall
come to pass, that him  that escapeth the sword of Hazael,
shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu,
shall Elisha slay. Yet I have left me seven thousand in
Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and
every mouth which hath not kissed' him. So, he departed
thence.LXXII.- ELIJAH AT MOUNT HOREB.
FROM KRUMMACHER.
KRUMMACHER is a German Divine, who has written several very interesting and instructive works, such as "Elisha the Tishbite" "Parables," etc.
1. " Go forth'," it had been said to Elijah-, " and stand
upon the mount before the Lord." The prophet hears it, and
leaves his cave'; and no sooner is he gone forth, than signs
occur which announce to him the approach of the Almighty.
The sacred historian here, indeed, depicts in simple language,
a most sublime scene.
2. The first sign was a tremendous wind'.  Just before, probably, the deepest silence had prevailed throughout
this dreary wilderness. The mountain tempest breaks forth,
and the bursting rocks thunder, as if the four winds, having
been confined there, had in an instant broken from their
prisons to fight' together. The clouds are driven about in the
sky, like squadrons of combatants rushing to the conflict. The
sandy desert is like a raging sea, tossing its curling billows to
the sky. Sinai is agitated, as if the terrors of the law-giving
were renewed around it.  The prophet feels the majesty of
Jehovah; it is awful and appalling. It is not a feeling of
peace, and of the Lord's blissful nearness, which possesses
Elijah's soul in this tremendous scene'; it is rather a feeling
of distressing distance';'"a strong wind' went before the
Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind."
3. The terrors of an earthquake"' next ensue. The very
foundations of the hills shake and are removed. The mountains and the rocks which were rent by the mighty wind,
threaten now to fall upon one another. Hills sink down, and
valleys rise; chasms yawn, and horrible depths unfold, as if
the earth were removed out of his place. The prophet, surrounded by the ruins of nature, feels still more of that divine
majesty, which "looketh upon the earth, and it trembleth."
But he still remains without any gracious communication of
Jehovah in the inner man. The earthquake was only the
second herald of the Deity. It went before the Lord, " but
the Lord was not in the earthquake."203
4. When this had ceased, an awful fire' passed by. As
the winds had done before, so now the fiames- come upon
him from every side, and the deepest shades of night are
turned into the light of day. Elijah, lost in adoring astonishment', beholds the awfully sublime spectacle', and the
inmost sensation of his heart must have been that of surprise and dread; but he enjoys, as yet, no delightful sensation of the divine presence'; " the Lord was not in the fire."
5. The fire disappears', and tranquillity, like the stillness
of the sanctuary, spreads gradually over all nature&gt;, and it
seems as if every hill and dales, yea, the whole earth and
skies', lay in silent homage at the footstool of eternal Majesty. The very mountains seemed to worship'; the whole
scene is hushed to profound peace'; and now, he hears a
" still, small voice."  "And it was so -when Elijah heard it,
he wrapt his face in his mantle," in token of reverential awe
and adoring wonder, and went forth, " and stood at the entrance of the cave."
TO TEACHERS.
RHETORICAL notation will now be omitted, as the learner may be
supposed to have become sufficiently acquainted with the subject to
judge for himself, with such occasional aid as the teacher may think
proper to give.LXXIII. - EARTH  AND HEAVEN.
WORDS marked thus t in the subsequent lessons should be defined and
spelled by the pupil, as "+summoned" and " +couch " in the first paragraph
of this lesson. The pupil may be required to write them upon a black board
or slate. If resort to a Dictionary is needed, Webster's should be referred
to as a standard authority in spelling and definition.
EARTH
1. THERE is grief, there is grief, there is wringing of hands,
And weeping and calling for aid;
For sorrow hath +summon'd her group, and it stands
Round the +couch where the +sufferer is laid.
And lips are all pallid, and cheeks are all cold,
And tears from the heart-springs are shed;
Yet who that looks on the sweet saint to behold,
But would gladly lie down in her stead.
2. There is grief, there is grief, there is +anguish and strife,
And the sufferer is striving for breath;
For the spirit will cling, O! how fondly, to life,
And stern is the struggle with death!
But the terrible +conflict grows deadlier still,
Till the last fatal symptoms have birth;
And the eye-ball is glazed, and the heart-blood is clill;
And this is the portion of EARTH!
HEAVEN.
3. There is bliss, there is bliss, in the regions above,
They have open'd the gates of the sky;
A spirit has soar'd to those mansions of love,
And seeks for +admittance on high.
And friends long divided are hasting to greet,
In a land where no sorrow may come,
And the +seraphs are eager a sister to meet,
And to welcome the child to its home.
4. There is bliss, there is bliss, at the foot of the throne;
See the spirit all -+purified bend;
And it beams with delight, since it gazes alone,
On the face of a father, a friend!
Then it joins in the +anthems forever that rise,
And its +frailty or folly forgiven,
It is dead to the earth, and new-born to the skies,
And this is the portion of HEAVEN!LXXIV.- THE SLEEPERS.
1. THEY are sleeping! Who are sleeping?
Children wearied with their play;
For the stars of night are peeping,
And the sun hath sunk away,
As the dew upon the +blossoms
Bow them on their slender stem,
Lo, as light as their own bosoms,
Balmy sleep hath +conquer'd them.
2. They are sleeping!- Who are sleeping?
Mortals +compass'd round with woe,
Eyelids wearing out with weeping,
Close for very weakness now:
And that short relief from sorrow,
Harass'd nature shall +sustain
Till they wake again to-morrow,
Strengthen'd to +contend with pain!
3. They are sleeping! Who are sleeping?
Captives in their gloomy cells;
Yet, sweet dreams are o'er them creeping,
With their many color'd spells;
All they love again they clasp them;
Feel again their long lost joys;
But the haste with which they grasp them,
Every fairy form destroys.
4. They are sleeping! Who are sleeping?
Misers by their +hoarded gold;
And in fancy now are heaping
Gems and pearls of price untold.
Golden chains their limbs +encumber,
Diamonds seem before them strown;
But they waken from their slumber,
And the splendid dream is flown.
5. They are sleeping! Who are sleeping?
Pause a moment, softly tread;
Anxious friends are fondly keeping
Vigils by the sleeper's bed!3. Suppressing the final consonants.

LXXV.  THE.MYSTERIOUS STRANGER.
FRox JANz TAYLOR.
1. IN a remote period of +antiquity, when tie +saperatural
and the marvelous obtained a redier eredenathan now, it
was fabled, that a stranger of extraordinary appearance was
observed passing the streets of one of the magnifient cities
of the east, remarking, with an eye of intelligent ouriosity,
every surrounding object.  Several individuals gathering
around him, questioned him conceraing his country and his
busiaess; but they presently perceied that le:was  unacquainted with their language, and he soon discovered himself
to be equally ignorant of the most common usages of soiety.
At the same time, the dignity and intelligence of  his air and
demeanor, forbade the idea of his eig  ther a +barbarian or a
+lunatic.
2. When, at length, he understood by their sigas, that they
wished to be informed whence he came, he pointed with great
significance to the sky;,:    io, the    wd,concluding
him'o be one of their. deities, er   o dig to pay him
dijo'vine    ors; but he no sooner comprehended their design,
thw  rejected it with horror; an     ing  his knees and
his ha     t rd heaven, in     attitude of prayer,:gastet*: to undersir ta he   o was a w,orshir of the
above. M*ter.t, re, it;i sa            d     i the  mstrious
stra    -pted the         of:" -a:the nobles ofthe city; under whose roof he applied himself with great
diligence to the +acquirement of the language, in which he
made such surprising +proficiency, that in a few days, he was
able to hold intelligent intercourse with those around him.
3. The noble host now resolved to take an early opportunity of satisfying his curiosity respecting the country and
quality of his guest; and upon his expressing his desire, the
stranger assured him, that he would answer his inquiries that
evening, after sunset. Accordingly, as night approached, he
led him forth upon the *balconies of the palace, which overlooked the wealthy and populous city. Innumerable lights
from its busy streets and splendid palaces, were now reflected
in the dark bosom of its noble river; where stately. vessels, laden with rich +merchandise from all parts of the
known world, lay anchored in the port. This was a city in
which the voice of the harp and the viol, and the sound of
the mill-stone, were continually heard; and +craftsmen of all
kinds of craft were there; and the light of a candle was seen
in every dwelling; and the voice of the bridegroom and the
voice of the bride were heard there.
4. The stranger mused awhile upon the glittering scene;
and listened to the confused murmur of mingling sounds.
Then suddenly raising his eyes to the starry +firmament, he
fixed them with an expressive gaze, on the beautiful evening
star, which was just sinking behind a dark grove, that surrounded one of the principle temples of the city.  "Miarvel
not," said he to his host, "that I am wont to gaze with fond
affection on yon silvery star. That was my home; yes, I was
lately an inhabitant of that tranquil planet; from whence a
vain curiosity has tempted me to wander.
5. "Often had I beheld, with wondering admiration, this
brilliant world of yours, even one of the brightest gems of
our +firmament, and the ardent desire I had long felt to know
something of its condition, was at length uneipectedly
gratified. I received permission and power from above to
ttraverse the mighty void, and. to direct my course to this
distant sphere. To that permission, however, one condition
was -annexed, to which my eagerness for the enterprise
induced me hastily to consent, namely, that I must thenceforth remain an inhabitant of this strange earth, and undergoall the +vicissitudes to which its natives are subject. Tell me,
therefore, I pray you, what is the lot of man; and explain to
me more fully than I yet understand, all that I see and hear
around me."
6. "Truly, sir," replied the astonished noble, " although
I am altogether unacquainted with the manners and customs,
products and fprivileges of your country, yet methinks, I
can not but congratulate you on your arrival in our world;
especially since it has been your good fortune to alight on a
part of it, affording such various sources of enjoyment, as
this our +opulent and tluxuriant city. And be assured it
will be my pride and pleasure to introduce you to all that is
most worthy the attention of such a distinguished foreigner."
7. Our adventurer, accordingly, was presently tinitiated
into those arts of luxury and pleasure, which were there well
understood. He was introduced by his obliging friend to
their public games and festivals; to their +theatrical tdiversions and tconvivial assemblies; and, in a short time, he
began to feel some relish for amusements, the meaning of
which, at first, he could scarcely comprehend.  The next
lesson which it became desirable to impart to him, was the
necessity of acquiring wealth, as the only means of obtaining pleasure.  This fact was no sooner understood by the
stranger, than he gratefully accepted the offer of his friendly
host, to place him in a situation in which he might +amass
riches.  To this object he began to apply himself with diligence; and soon became, in some measure, reconciled to the
manners and customs of our planet, strangely as they differed from those of his own.
LXXVI. - THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER- CONCLUDED.
1. HE had been but a few weeks diligently engaged in his
new plans for the acquisition of wealth, when, walking in the
cool of the day with his friend, in the outskirts of the city,
his attention was arrested by the appearance of a +spacious
enclosure near which they passed.- le inquired the use to
which it was appropriated.  "It is" replied the nobleman,-ECLECTIC SERIES.
209
" a place of public interment."  " I do not understand you,"
said the stranger. " It is the place," repeated his friend,
" where we bury our dead."  " Excuse me, sir," replied his
companion, with some +embarrassment, "I must trouble you
to explain yourself yet further."
2. The nobleman repeated the information in still plainer
terms. " I am still at a loss to comprehend you perfectly,"
said the stranger, turning deadly pale. "This must relate to
something of which I was not only totally ignorant in my
own world, but of which I have, as yet, had no +intimation
in yours. I pray you, therefore, to satisfy my curiosity; for
if I have any clue to your meaning, this surely, is a matter
of more mighty concernment, than any to which you have
hitherto directed me."
3. " My good friend," replied the nobleman, " you must
indeed be a +novice among us, if you have yet to learn that
we must all, sooner or later, submit to take our place in these
dismal abodes. Nor will I deny, that it is one of the least
desirable of the circumstances which tappertain to our condition; for which reason it is a matter rarely referred to in
polished society; and this accounts for your being hitherto
uninformed on the subject.. But, truly, sir, if the inhabitants of the place from whence you came are not liable to any
simi4ar misfortune, I advise you to betake yourself back
again with all speed; for be assured there is no escape here,
nor could I guarantee your safety even for a single hour."
4. "Alas!" replied the adventurer, "I must submit to
the conditions of my enterprise, of which, till now, I little
understood the import. But explain to me, I beseech you,
something more of the nature and consequence of this wondrous change, and tell me at what period it commonly happens
to man." While he thus spoke, his voice +faltered, and his
whole frame shook violently; his countenance was as pale as
death. By this time his companion, finding the discourse
becoming more serious than was agreeable, declared he must
refer him to the priests for further information, this subject
being very much out of his province. " How! " exclaimed
the stranger, "then I could not have understood you. Do
the priests only die?  Are you not to die also?"  His
friend, tevading these questions, hastily conducted his
18NEW SIXTH RIEADER.
importunate companion to one of their tmagnificent temples,
where he gladly consigned him to the instructions of the
priesthood.
5. The emotion, which the stranger had betrayed when he
received the first idea of death, was yet slight in comparison
with that which he experienced as soon as he gathered, from
the discourses of the priests, some notions of immortality,
and of the talternative of happiness or misery in a future
state. But this agony of mind was exchanged for +transport, when he learned that, by the +performance of certain
conditions before death, the state of happiness might be
secured. His eagerness to learn the nature of these terms,
excited the surprise afid even the contempt of his sacred
teachers.:.They advi~sd him  to remain satisfied, for the
present, with the instructions he had received, and defer the
remainder of the discussion till tomorrow.  "How!" exclaimed the novice, "say ye not that death may come at any
hour?  May it not come this hour? And what if it should
come, before I have performed these conditions?  0! withhold not the excellent knowledge from me, a single moment! "
6. The priests, suppressing a smile at his simplicity, proceeded to explain their ttheology to their attentive auditor.
But who can describe the tecstasy of his happiness, when he
was given to understand the required conditions were, generally, of easy and pleasant performance, and the occasional
difficulties, which might attend them, would entirely cease
with the short term of his earthly existence. -' If, then, I
understand you rightly," said he to his instructors, "this
event which you call death, and which seems in itself
strangely terrible, is most desirable and tblissful. What a
filvor is this which is granted to me, in being sent to inhabit
a planet in which I can die!"
7. The priests again exchanged smiles with each other;
but their ridicule was wholly lost on the tenraptured stranger.
When the first ttransports of his emotion had subsided, he
began to reflect with more uneasiness on the time he had
already lost since his arrival. "Alas! what have I been
doing?" exclaimed he. "This gold which I have been collectingr, tell me, reverensd priests, will it avail me anything
when the thirty or forty years are expired, which you say I211
may possibly +sojourn in your planet?"  "Nay," replied the
priests, "but verily you will find it of excellent use so long as
you remain in it."  "A  very little of it will suffice me,"
replied he; "for consider how soon this period will be past.
What avails it what my condition may be for so short a
season? I will betake myself from this hour, to the grand
concerns of which you have so charitably informed me."
8. Accordingly, from that period, continues the +legend,
the stranger devoted himself to the performance of those conditions on which, he was told, his future welfare depended;
but, in so doing, he had an opposition to tencounter wholly
unexpected, and for which he was at a loss even to account.
By thus devoting his chief attention to his chief interests, he
excited the surprise, the contempt, atd even the enmity of
most of the inhabitants of the city; and they rarely mentioned him but with a term of reproach, which has been
variously rendered in all the modern languages.
9. Nothing could equal the stranger's surprise at this circumstance; as well as at that of his fellow-citizens' appearing,
generally, so extremely indifferent as they did, to their own
interests. That they should have so little prudence and forethought, as to provide only for their +necessities and pleasures,
for that short part of their existence in which they were to
remain on this planet, he could but consider as the effect of
disordered intellect; so that he even returned their incivilities to himself with affectionate texpostulation, accompanied
by lively emotions of compassion and +amazement.
10. If ever he was tempted for a moment to violate any of
the conditions of his future happiness, he bewailed his own
madness with tagonizing emotions; and to all the invitations
he received from others to do anything inconsistent with his
real interests, he had but one answer-"Oh," he would say,
"I amu to die: I am to die."LXXVII.? A PSALM OF LIFE.

LXXVIII. - THE DREAM  OF CLARENCE.
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
CLARENCE, prisoner in the Tower of London.
Enter BRAKENBURY.
Brakenabury.. WHY looks your grace so heavily to-day?
Clarence.   O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of fearful dreams, of ugly' sights,
That, as I am a Christian, faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though't were to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time.
Brak. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.
Clar. Methought that I had broken from the Tower,
And was tembark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloster;
Who, from my cabin, tempted me to walk
Upon the thatches; whence we look'd toward England,
And tcited up a thousand heavy times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster,
That had befallen us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought, that Gloster stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
O then, methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of water in mine ears!
What sights of ugly death within mine eyes I
Methought, I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
tInestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea.
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept
(As't were in scorn of eyes) reflecting gems,
That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
Brak. Had you such leisure, in the time of death,
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
Clar. Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the +envious floodKept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast, and wandering air;
But %smother'd it within my panting bulk;
Which almost burst to- belch it in the sea.
Brak. Awaked you not with thy sore agony?
Clar. 0 no; myflream was lengthen'd after life!
O, then began the tmpest to my soul!
I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that tgrim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first, that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, " What scourge for *perjury
Can this dark mcmarchy afford false Clarence?"
And so he vanish'd.
Then came wandering by
A shadow, like an angel with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he shriek'd out aloud:
"Clarence is come! false, fleeting, perjur'd Clareneet
That stabb'd mne in thefield by Tewksbury:
Seize on him,'furies, take him to your torments "
With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends
+Environ'd me, and hOwl'd in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise,
I, trembling, waked, and, for a season after,
Could not believe but that I was in hell;
Such terrible +impression made my dream.
Brak. No marvel, lord, that it affrighted you;
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
Clar. O, Brakenbury, I have done these things,
That now give evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake, and see how he +requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers can not appease thee,
But thou wilt be tavenged on my misdeeds,
Yet texecute thy wrath on me alone:
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children I
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
Brak. I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!

Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night moaming, and the noon-tide night.

LXXIX.- CHOICE OF HERCULES.
FROM THE TATLER.
1. WHEN Hercules was in that part of his youth, in which
it was natural for him to consider what course of life he
ought to pursue, he one day retired into a desert, where the
silence and the -solitude of the place very much favored his
tmeditations. As he was musing on his present condition,
and very much perplexed in himself on the state of life
which he should choose, he saw two womeh of larger stature
than ordinary, approaching him.
2. One of them had a very noble air and.graceful tdeportment; ier beauty was natural and easy, her person clean
and unspotted, her eyes cast toward the ground with an
agreeable +reserve, her motion and behavior full of modesty,
and her raiment as white as snow. The other had a great
deal of health and +floridness in her countenance, which she
had helped with an artificial white and red; and she endeavored to appear more graceful than ordinary in her mein,
by a mixture of affectation in all her gestures. She had a
wonderful confidence and tassurance in her looks, and all the
variety of colors in her dress, that she thought were the most
proper to show her complexion to advantage. She cast her
eyes upon herself, then turned them on those that were
present, to see how they liked her, and often looked on the
figure she made in her own shadow;: Upon her approach to
Hercules, she stepped before the other lady, who came forward with a regular composed +carriage, and running up to
him, +accosted him after the following manner:
3. "My dear Hercules, I find you are very much divided
in your thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to
choose: be my friend, and follow me: I will lead you into the
possession of pleasure, and out of the reach of pain, and
remove you from all the noise and disquietude of business.
The affairs of either war or peace shall have no power to
disturb you. Your whole employment shall be to make your
life easy, and entertain every sense with its proper gratifications. fSumptuous tables, beds of roses, clouds of perfumes,
+concerts of music, crowds of beauties, are all in readiness toARTICULATION.

receive you. Come along with me into this region of delights,
this world of pleasure, and bid farewell forever to care, to
pain, to business." Hercules, hearing the lady talk after this
manner, desired to know her name; to which she answered,
"My friends and those who are well acquainted with me, call
me Happiness: but my enemies and those who would injure my
treputation, have given me the name of Pleasure."
4. By this time, the other lady had come up, and addressed herself to the young hero in a very different manner.
"Hercules," said she, "I offer myself to you, because I know
you are descended from the gods, and give proofs of that descent,
by your love of virtue, and application to the studies proper for
your age. This makes me hope that you will gain, both for
yourself and me, an immortal reputation.  But before I
invite you into my society and friendship, I will be open and
sincere with yolu; and must lay this down as an established
truth, that there is nothing truly valuable which can be
purchased without pains and labor. The gods have set a
price upon every real and noble pleasure. If you would gain
the favor of tDeity, you must be at the pains of worshiping
him; if the friendship of good men, you must study to oblige
them; if you would be honored by your country, you must
take care to serve it; in short, if you would be eminent in
war or peace, you must become master of all the qualifications
that can make you so. These are the only terms and conditions upon which I can promise happiness."
5. The goddess of Pleasure here broke in upon her discourse; "You see," said she, "Hercules, by ber own confession, the way tether pleasures is long and difficult, whereas
that which I propose is short and easy." "Alas!" said the
other lady, whose tvisage glowed with scorn and pity, "what
are the pleasures you propose? To eat before you are hungry,
drink before you are thirsty, sleep before you are tired; to
gratify appetites before they are raised, and raise such appetites as nature never planted. You never heard the most
tdelicious music, which is the praise of yourself; or saw the
most beautiful object, which is the work of your own hands.
Your tvotaries pass away their youth in a dream of mistaken
pleasures; while they are hoarding up tanguish, torment, and
remorse, for old age.217
6. "As for me, I am the friend of the gods and of good
men; an agreeable companion of the +artisan; a household
guardian to the fathers of families; a +patron and protector
of servants; an associate in all true and generous friendships.   The banquets of my +votaries are never costly,
but always delicious; for none eat or drink at them, who are
not invited by hunger and thirst. Their slumbers are sound,
and their wakings cheerful. My young men have the pleasure
of hearing themselves praised by those who are in years:
and those who are in years, of being honored by those who
are young. In a word, my followers are favored by the gods,
beloved by their acquaintance, esteemed by their country,
and, after the close of their labors, honored by posterity."
7. We know, by the life of this tmemorable hero to which
of these two ladies he gave up his heart; and, I believe,
every one who reads this, will do him the justice to approve
of his choice.

Into a cold, tcare-fretted, heartless man.

And close behind comes death, and ere we know,
That even these tunavailing gifts are ours,

LXXXI. - LAMENT FOR THE DEAD.
FROM OSSIAN.
1. Reyno. THE wind and rain are over; calm is the noon
of day. The clouds are divided in heaven; over the green
hill flies the inconstant sun; red, through the stony vale,
comes down the stream of the hill. Sweet are thy tmurmurs,
O streamI But more sweet is the voice I hear. It is the
voice of Alpin, the son of song, mourning for the dead. Bent
is his head of age, anid red his tearful eye. Alpin, thou son
of song, why alone on the silent hill?  Why complainest thou
as a blast in the wood, as a wave on the lonely phore?
2. Alpin. My tears, O Reyno! are for the dead; my
voice for the *inhabitants of the grave. Tall thou art on the
hill; fair among'the sons of the slain. But thou shalt fall
like Morar; and the mourners shall sit on thy tomb. The hills
shall know thee no more, thy bow shall lie in the halls, unstrung.
3. Thou wert swift,' O Morar! as a roe on the hill; terrible
as a +meteor of fire.  Thy wrath was as the storm; thy sword
in'battle, as lightning in the field. Thy voice was like a
stream after rain; like thunder on distant hills. Many fell
by thy arm; they were consumed in the flames of thy wrath.
But when thou didst return from war, how peaceful was thy
brow! Thy face was like the sun, after rain; like the moon,in the silence of night; calm as the breast of the lake, when
the loud wind is hushed into repose. Narrow is thy dwelling, now; dark the place of thine abode.  With three steps,
I tcompass thy grave, 0 thou, who wast so great before!
Four stones, with their heads of moss, are the only tmemorial
of thee. A tree with scarce a leaf, long grass whistling in the
wind, mark to the hunter's eye, the grave of mighty Morar.
4. Morar! thou art low indeed: thou hast no mother to
mourn thee; no maid with her tears of love. Dead is she
that brought thee forth; fallen is the daughter of Morglan.
Who, on his staff, is this? Who this, whose head is white
with. age, whose eyes are +galled with tears, who quakes at
every step? It is thy father, 0 Morar! the father of no son
but thee. Weep, thou father of Morar, weep; but thy son
heareth thee not. Deep is the sleep of the dead, low their
pillow of dust.  No more shall he hear thy voice, no more
awake at thy call. When shall it be morn in the grave, to
bid the slumberer awake? Farewell, thou bravest of men;
thou conqueror of the field; but the field shall see thee no
more, nor the gloomy wood be lighltened by the splendor of
thy steel.  Thou hast left no son,-but the song shall preserve thy name.

And sweetly reposes forever.
LXXXIII. - WESTMINSTER ABBEY.
FROM ADDISOn.
JOSEPH ADDISON, an English author, was born in 1672. He contributed largely to the Tatltr, a periodical paper, and was also the
chief writer of the Spectator. His writings afford the best models of
style in our language. He died in 1719.
1. WHEN I am in a serious humor, I very often walk by
myself in Westminster Abbey, where the gloominess of the
place, and the use to which it is applied, with the solemnityof the building, and the condition of the people who lie in it,
are apt to fill the mind with a kind of melancholy, or rather
thoughtfulness, that is not disagreeable. I yesterday passed
the whole afternoon in the church-yard, the tcloisters, and
the church, amusing myself with the tomb-stones and inscriptions that I met with in those several regions of the dead.
Most of them recorded nothing else of the buried person, but
that he was born upon one day, and died upon another;
the whole history of his life being +comprehended in these
two circumstances, that are common to all mankind. I
could not but look upon these +registers of existence, whether
of brass or marble, as a kind of +satire upon the departed
persons, who had left no other memorial of them, but that
they were born, and that they died.
2. Upon my going into the church, I entertained myself
with the digging of a grave, and saw in every shovelful of it
that was thrown up, the fragment of a bone or skull, intermixed with a kind of fresh, +moldering earth, that, sometime
or other, had a place in the composition of a human body.
Upon this, I began to consider with myself, what innumerable multitudes of people lay confused together under the
pavement of that ancient tcathedral; how men and women,
friends and enemies, priests and soldiers, monks and tprebendaries, were crumbled among one another, and blended together in the same common mass; how beauty, strength, and
youth, with old age, weakness, and deformity, lay undistinguished in the same tpromiscuous heap of matter.'3. After having thus surveyed this +magazine of mortality,
as it were in the lump, I examined it more particularly, by the
accounts which I found on several of the monuments, which
are raised in every quarter of that ancient tfabric. Some of
them were covered with such extravagant tepitaphs, that if
it were possible for the dead person to be acquainted with
them, he would blush at the praises which his friends have
bestowed upon him. There are others so excessively modest,
that they deliver the character of the person departed, in
Greek or Hebrew, and, by that means, are not understood
once in a twelvemonth. In the poetical quarter I found there
were poets who had no monuments, and monuments which
had no poets. I observed, indeed, that the present war hadNEW SIXTH READER.
filled the church with many of those uninhabited +monuments, which had been erected to the memory of persons,
whose bodies were, perhaps, buried in the plains of Blenheim,
or in the bosom of the ocean.
4. I know, that entertainments of this nature are apt to
raise dark and dismal thoughts in timorous minds and gloomy
imaginations; but, for my own part, though I am always
serious, I do not know what it is to be melancholy; and can,
therefore, take a view of nature in her deep and solemn
scenes, with the same pleasure, as in her most gay and delightful ones. By this means, I can improve myself with those
objects, which others consider with terror.
5. When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the
beautiful, every +inordinate desife goes out; when I meet
with the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart melts
with compassion; when I see th3 tomb of the parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for them, whom we
must quickly follow; when I see kings lying by those who
tdeposed them, when I see rival wits lying side by side, or
holy men that divided the world by their contests and disputes, I reflect, with sorrow and astonishment, on the little
+competitions, tfactions, and debates of mankind. When I
read the several dates of the tombs, of some that died
yesterday) some, six hundred  years ago, I consider that
great day when we shall all of us, be +cotemporaries, and
make our appearance together.
LXXXIV.- ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCH-YARD.
FROM GRAY.
THOMAs GRAY, an English poet, was born 1716, and was educated at
Cambridge. The Elegy, Written in a Country Church-yard, is the most celebrated and popular of his poems. He died in 1771.
1. TEi tcurfew tolls; the +knell of parting day!
The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the tlea;
The plowman homeward tplods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me..ECLECTIC SERIES.
223
2. Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the beetle wheels his +droning flight,
And drowsy ttinklings lull the distant folds:
3. Save, that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,
The tmoping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wand'ring near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient, tsolitary reign.
4. Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mold'ring heap,
Each in his narrow cell forever laid,
The rude forefathers of the thamlet sleep.
5. The breezy call of +incense-breathing morn,
The swallow, twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill tclarion, or the echoing horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
6. For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewife ply her eyening care;
Nor children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.
7. Oft did-the harvest to their sickle yield;
Their furrow oft the stubborn tglebe has broke;
How +jocund did they drive their team afield I
How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!
8. Let not ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and tdestiny obscure;
Nor grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile,
The short and simple +annals of the poor.
9. The boast of theraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Await, alike, the tinevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
10. Nor you, ye proud, timpute to these the fault,
If mem'ry o'er their tomb no ttrophies raise,
Where, through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,
The pealing tanthem swells the note of praise.
11. Can +storied urn or animated tbust,
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can honor's voice provoke the silent dust,
Or flattery soothe the dull, cold ear of death?12. Perhaps, in this neglected spot, is laid
Some heart once pregnant with tcelestial fire;
Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
Or waked to *ecstasy the living lyre.
13. But knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;
Chill tpenury repress'd their noble rage,
And froze the tgenial current of the soul.
14. Full many a gem of purest ray serene,
The dark, unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;
Full many a flower is born to, blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
15. Some village Hampden, that, with dauntless breast,
The little tyrant of his fields withstood;
Some mute, inglorious Milton here may rest;
Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.
16. The applause of list'ning senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes,
17. Their lot forbade; nor, +circumscribed alone
Their glowing virtues, but their crimes confined;
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a thirone,
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind;
18. The struggling pangs of tconscious truth to hide;
To quench the blushes of *ingenuous shame;
Or heap the shrine of luxury and pride,
With tincense kindled at the muse's flame.
19. Far from the madding crowd's tignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray:
Along the cool, tsequester'd vale of life,
They kept the noiseless ttenor of their way.
20. Yet e'en these bones, from insult to protect,
Some frail +memorial still, erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
Implores the passing ftribute of a sigh.
21. Their names, their years, spell'd by the unletter'd muse,
The place of fame and elegy supply;
And many a holy text around she strews,
Teaching the rustic tmoralist to die.22. For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing, anxious being e'er resigned;
Left the warm +precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?
23. On some fond breast the parting soul relies;
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
E'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries,
E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.
24. For thee, who, mindful of the unhonor'd dead,
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,
If, chance, by lonely contemplation led,
Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,
25. Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
"Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn,
Brushing, with hasty step, the dews away,
To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.
26. There, at the foot of yonder nodding beeclr,
That wreathes its old, +fantastic roots so high,
His listless length, at noontide would he stretch,
And pore upon the brook that babbles by.
27. Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
Mutt'ring his wayward tfancies, he would rove;
Now, drooping, woeful, wan, like one forlorn,
Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love
28. One morn, I miss'd him on the accustom'd hill,
Along the heath, and near his fav'rite tree:
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
Nor up the lawn, nor at the woods was he.
29. The next, with tdirges due, in sad tarray,
Slow through the church-yard path, we saw him borne.
Approach, and read (for thou canst read) the lay,'Graved on the stone beneath yon a-ged thorn."
THE EPITAPH.
30 Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,
A youth to Fortune and to Fame, unknown:
Fair tScience frown'd not on his humble birth,
And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.
31. Large was his bounty, and his soul, sincere:
tIeaven did a recompense as largely send:
LDIRECTIONS
FOR ACQUIRING A GOOD ARTICULATION.
WORDS being made up of one or more elementary
sounds, the first object of the student should be, to
acquire the power of uttering those elements with distinctness and force; for if the elementary sounds are but
imperfectly formed, the entire word must be indistinct.
Practice upon these sounds should be persevered in, until
the learner has acquired a perfect control of his organs of
speech. This exercise is one of great importance, as, in addition to the habit of correct articulation thus formed, it imparts a strength to the voice, which can not be acquired in
any other way.
As the vowels are the most prominent elements of all words,
as well as the most easily uttered, it is proper that they should
constitute the first lesson.
Each of these can be uttered with great force, so as to give
a distinct expression of its sound, although the voice is suddenly suspended, the moment the sound is produced. This is
done by expelling each sound from the throat in the same
manner that the syllable "ahl" is uttered in endeavoring
to deter a child from something it is about to do; thus,
a -a'-a'-.
Let the pupil be required to explode from the throat, in this
manner, every one of the elements, in the following table, with
all possible suddenness and percussive force, until he is able to
do it with ease and accuracy. This must not be considered as
accomplished, until he can give each sound with entire clearness, and with all the suddenness of the "crack" of a rifle.
Care must be taken that the sound of the vowel alone be
heard.
EXERCISE ON VOWEL ELEMENTS.
Pronounce each word, and then its vowel sounds.

LXXXV. - THE VOYAGE.
FROM IRVING.
1. To an American visiting Europe, the long voyage he
has to make, is an excellent preparative. The temporary
absence of worldly scenes and employments, produces a state
of mind peculiarly fitted to receive new and vivid impressions. The vast space of waters, that separates the +hemispheres, is like a blank page in existence.  There is no
gradual ttransition by which, as in Europe, the features and
population of one country blend almost +imperceptibly with
those of another. From the moment you lose sight of the
land you have left, all is +vacancy, until you step on the opposite shore, and are launched, at once, into the bustle and
novelties of another world.
2. In traveling by land, there is a tcontinuity of scene,
and a connection of persons and +incidents, that carry on
the story of life, and lessen the effect of absence and separation. We drag, it is true, "a lengthened chain," at each
remove of our pilgrimage; but the chain is unbroken. We
can trace it back, link by link; and we feel, that the last of
them still +grapples us to home.   But a wide sea-voyage
severs us at once. It makes us conscious of being cast loose
from  the secure anchorage of settled life, and sent adrift
upon a doubtful world. It interposes a gulf, not merely imaginary, but real, between us and our homes; a gulf, subject
to tempests, and fear, and uncertainty, that makes distance
+palpable, and return +precarious.
3. Such at least was the case with myself. As I saw the
last blue line of my native land fade away like a cloud in the
+horizon, it seemed as if I had closed one volume of the
world and its concerns, and I had time for meditation before227
I opened another. That land, too, now vanishing from my,
view, which contained all that was most dear to me in life,
what tvicissitudes might occur in it, what changes might take
place in me before I should visit it again! Who can tell,
when he sets forth to wander, whither he may be driven
by the uncertain current of existence, or when he may return, or whether it may ever be his lot to review the scenes
of his childhood?
4. I said, that at sea all is vacancy. I should correct the
expression. To one given to day-dreaming, and fond of
losing himself in reverie, a sea-voyage is full of subjects for
meditation; but then, they are the wonders of the deep and
of the air, and rather tend to abstract the mind from worldly
+themes. I delighted to tloll over the quarter-railing, or to
climb to the main-top, of a calm day, and muse for hours
together, on the tranquil bosom of a summer's sea; to gaze
upon the piles of golden clouds, just peering above the horizon, fancy them some fairy realms, and people them with a
creation of my own; to watch the gentle +undulating billows,
rolling their silver volumes, as if to die away on those happy
shores.
5. There was a delicious +sensation of mingled security
and awe, with which I looked down from my giddy hight, at
the monsters of the deep at their uncouth tgambols; shoals
of porpoises, tumbling about the bow of the ship; the
grampus, slowly heaving his huge forIn above the surface, or
the +ravenous shark, darting like a specter, through the blue
waters. My imagination would conjure up all that I had
heard or read of the watery world beneath me; of the finny
herds that roam its fathomless valleys; of the shapeless monsters that lurk among the very foundations of the earth, and
of those wild tphantasms that swell the tales of fishermen
and sailors.
6. Sometimes, a distant sail, gliding along the edge 6f the
ocean, would be another theme of idle tspeculation. How
interesting this fragment of a world, hastening to rejoin the
great mass of existence I What a glorious monument of human invention, that has thus triumphed over wind and wave;
has brought the ends of the world into communion; has established an +interchange of blessings, pouring into the tsterileregions of the north, all the luxuries of the south; has diffused the light of knowledge, and the charities of cultivated
life; and has thus bound together those scattered portions
of the human race, between which nature seemed to have
thrown an +insurmountable tbarrier.
7. We one day descried some shapeless object drifting at
a distance. At sea, every thing that breaks the monotony
of the surrounding expanse, attracts attention.  It proved
to be the mast of a ship that must have been completely
wrecked: for there were the remains of handkerchiefs by
which some of the crew had fastened themselves to the spar,
to prevent their being washed off by the waves. There was no
trace by which the name of the ship could be ascertained.
8. The wreck had evidently drifted about for many
months; clusters of shell-fish had fastened about it, and
long sea-weeds flaunted at its sides. But where, thought I,
is the crew? Their struggle has long been over; they have
gone down amid the roar of the tempest; their bones lie
whitening among the caverns of the deep. Silence and toblivion, like the waves, have closed over them, and no one can
tell the story of their end. What sighs have been twafted
after that ship! what prayers offered up at the deserted fireside of home!  How often has the father, the wife, the
mother, pored over the daily news, to catch some tcasual intelligence of this rover of the deep! How has expectation
darkened into anxiety; anxiety into dread; and dread into
despair! Alas! not one tmemento shall ever return, for love
to cherish. All that shall ever be known is, that she sailed
from her port, "and was never heard of more."
LXXXVI. - THE VOYAGE - CONCLUDED.
1. THE sight of the wreck gave rise to many dismal
anecdotes. This was particularly the case in the evening,
when the weather, which had hitherto been fair, began to
look wild and threatening, and gave indications of one of
those sudden storms that will sometimes break in upon the
+serenity of a summer's voyage. As we sat around the dull229
light of a lamp, in the cabin, that made the gloom more
tghastly, every one had his tale of shipwreck and disaster.
I was particularly struck by a short one related by the
captain.
2. "As I was once sailing," said he,'in a fine, stout ship,
across the banks of Newfoundland, one of those heavy fogs
that prevail in those parts, rendered it impossible for us to
see far ahead, even in the day time; but at night, the weather
was so thick, that we could not distinguish any object, at
twice the length of the ship. I kept lights at the mast-head
and a constant watch forward, to look out for +fishing-smacks,
which are accustomed to lie at anchor on the banks. The
wind was blowing a smacking breeze, and we were going at
a great rate through the water. Suddenly, the watch gave
the alarm of'a sail a-head!' It was scarcely uttered before
we were upon her. She was a small schooner at anchor,
with her broadside toward us. The crew were all asleep,
and had neglected to hoist a light.
3. "We struck her just +amidships. The force, the size,
the weight of our vessel, bore her down below the waves;
we passed over her, and were hurried on our course. As
the crashing wreck was sinking beneath us, I had a glimpse
of two or three half-naked wretches, rushing from her cabin;
they just started from their beds, to be swallowed shrieking
by the waves; I heard their drowning cry, mingling with
the wind. The blast that bore it to our ears, swept us out of
all further hearing. I shall never forget that cry! It was
some time, before we could put the ship about, she was under
such headway. We returned as nearly as we could guess,
to the place where the smack had anchored. We cruised
about for several hours in the dense fog. We fired signalguns, and listened if we might hear the halloo of any tsurvivors; but all was silent-we never saw or heard any thing
of them more."
4. I confess these stories, for a time, put an end to all my
fine fancies. The storm increased with the night. The sea
was lashed into ttremendous confusion. There was a fearful
sullen sound of rushing waves and broken tsurges. At
times, the black volume of clouds overhead seemed rent
asunder by flashes of lightning, that quivered along thefoaming billows, and made the succeeding darkness doubly
terrible. The thunders bellowed over the wild waste of
waters, and were echoed and prolonged by the moaning waves.
As I saw the ship staggering and plunging among these
roaring caverns, it seemed fmiraculous that she regained her
balance, or preserved her tbuoyancy.  Her yards would dip
into the water; her bow was almost buried beneath the waves.
Sometimes, an fimpending +surge appeared ready to overwhelm her, and nothing but a +dexterous movement of the
helm preserved her from the shock.
5. When I retired to my cabin, the awful scene still followed me. The whistling of the wind through the rigging,
sounded like funeral wailings. The creaking of the masts,
the straining and groaning of +bulk-heads, as the ship
labored in the tweltering sea, were frightful. As I heard the
waves rushing along the sides of the ship, and roaring in my
very ear, it seemed as if death were raging round this floating prison, seeking for his prey: the mere starting of a nail,
the yawning of a seam, might give him entrance.
6. A fine day, however, with a tranquil sea and favoring
breeze, soon put all these dismal reflections to flight. It is
impossible to resist the gladdening influence of fine -weather
and fair wind at sea. When the ship is decked out in all her
+canvas, every sail swelled, and tcareering gayly over the
curling waves, how lofty, how gallant she appears! how she
seems to lord it over the deep!-But it is time to get ashore.
7. It was a fine sunny morning, when the thrilling cry of
"land!" was heard from the mast-head. None, but those
who have experienced it, can form an idea of the delicious
throng of sensations which rush into an American's bosom,
when he first comes in sight of Europe. There is a volume
of associations with the very name. It is the land of
promise, +teeming with every thing of which his childhood
has heard, or on which his studious years have tpondered.
From that time, until the moment of arrival, it was all
feverish texcitement. The ships of war, that +prowled like
fguardian giants along the coast; the headlands of Ireland,
stretching out into the channel; the Welsh mountains, towering
into clouds; all were objects of intense interest. As we sailed
up the Mersey, my eye dwelt with delight on neat cottages,
---- 1 -                 0'"'""'""b~231
with their trim shrubberies and green grass-plants. I saw
the moldering ruins of an abbey overrun with ivy, and the
taper spire of the village church, rising from the brow of a
naeighboring hill. All were tcharacteristic of England.
8. The tide and wind were so favorable, that the ship was
enabled to come at once to the pier. It was thronged with
people; some, idle lookers-on; others, eager expectants of
friends or relatives.  I could distinguish the merchant to
whom the ship was +consigned. I knew him by his calculating
brow and restless air. His hands were thrust into his pockets;
he was whistling thoughtfully, and walking to and fro, a small
space having been accorded to him by the crowd, in deference
to his temporary importance. There were repeated cheerings
and salutations interchanged between the shore and the ship,
as friends happened to +recognize each other.
9. I particularly noticed one young woman, of humble dress,
but interesting +demeanor.  She was leaning forward from
among the crowd; her eye hurried over the ship as it neared
the shore, to catch some wished-for countenance. She seemed
disappointed and agitated, when I heard a faint voice call her
name. It was fromn a poor sailor who had been ill, all the
voyage, and had excited the sympathy of every one on board.
When the weather was fine, his messmates had spread a mattress for him, on deck, in the shade; but of late, his illness
had so increased, that he had taken to his +hammock, and
only breathed a wish, that he might see his wife before he
died. He had been helped on deck, as we came up the river,
and was now leaning against the shrouds, with a countenance
so wasted, so pale, so ghastly, that it was no wonder even the
eye of affection did not recognize him. But at the sound of
his voice, her eye darted on his features; it read at once the
whole volume of sorrow; she clasped her hands, uttered a
faint shriek, and stood wringing them in silent agony.
10. All was now hurry and bustle; the meetings of acquaintances; the greetings of friends; the consultations of men
of business. I alone was +solitary and idle. I had no friend to
meet, no cheering to receive. I stepped upon the land of my
forefathers, but felt that I was a stranger in the land.LXXXVII. - SONG OF EMIGRATION.
FROM MRS. HEMANS.
1. THERE was heard a song on the tchiming sea,
A mingled breathing of grief and tglee;
Man's voice unbroken by sighs was there,
Filling with triumph the sunny air;
Of fresh, green lands, and of pastures new,
It sang, while the bark through -the tsurges flew.
But ever and anon
A murmur of farewell,
Told by its tplaintive tone,
That from woman's lip it fell.
2. "Away, away, o'er the foaming main!"
This was the free and joyous strain"There are clearer skies than ours afar,
We will shape our course by a brighter star;
There are plains whose tverdure no foot hath press'd,
And whose wealth is all for the first brave guest."
"But alas! that we should go,"
Sang the farewell voices then,
"From the +homestead warm and low,
By the brook and in the glen!"
3. " We will rear new homes, under trees that glow
As if gems were the tfruitage of every bough;
O'er our white walls we will train the vine,
And sit in its shadow at day's decline;
And watch our herds as they range at will
Through the green +savannas, all bright and still."
"But woe for that sweet shade
Of the flowering orchard-trees,
Where first our children play'd'Mid the birds and honey-bees!"
4. "All, all our own shall the forests be,
As to the bound of the troe-buck free!
None shall say,' Hither, no further pass!'
We will track each step through the wavy grass
Wle will chase the elk in his speed and might,
And bring proud spoils to the hearth at night."
"But oh! the gray church-tower,
And the wound of the sabbath-bell,
And the shelter'd garden-bower,
We have bid them all farewell!"
232
t233
5. " We will give the names of ourSfearless race
To each bright river whose course we trace;
We will leave our memory with mounts and floods,
And the path of our daring, in boundless woods;
And our works on many a lake's green shore,
Where the Indians' graves lay alone, before."
" But who shall-teach the flowers
Which our children lov'd, to dwell
In a soil that is not ours?
Home, home and friends, farewell!"
LXXXVIII.- SCENE FROM THE POOR GENTLEMAN.
FROM COLMAN.
Sir Robert Bramble and Humphrey Dobbins.
Sir R. I'LL tell you what, Humphrey Dobbins, there is
not a syllable of sense in all you have been saying. But I
suppose you will maintain there is.
Hum. Yes.
Sir R. Yes! is that the way you talk to me, you old boor?
What's my name?
Hum. Robert Bramble.
Sir R. An't I a baronet? Sir Robert Bramble of Blackberry Hall, in the county of Kent?'T is time you should
know it, for you have been my clumsy, two-fisted valet these
thirty years: can you deny that?
Hum. Hem!
Sir R. Hem? what do you mean by hem?  Open that
rusty door of your mouth, and make your ugly voice walk out
of it. Why do n't you answer my question?
Gutm. Because, if I tcontradict you, I shall tell you a lie,
and when I agree with you, you are sure to fall out.
Sir R. Humphrey Dobbins, I have been so long endeavoring to beat a few brains into your tpate, that all your hair has
tumbled off before my point is carried.
Hum. What then? Our parson says my head is an temblem
of both our honors.
Sir R. Ay; because honors, like your head, are apt to be
empty.
Hum. No; but if a servant has grown bald under his mas20NEW SIXTH READER.
ter's nose, it looks as if there was honesty on one side, and
regard for it on the other.
Sir R. Why, to be sure, old Humphrey, you are as honest
as a-pshaw! the parson means to +palaver us; but, to
return to my position, I tell you, I do n't like your flat
+contradiction.
Hum. Yes, you do.
Sir R. I tell you I do n't. I only love to hear men's arguments. I hate their +flummery.
Hum. What do you call flummery?
Sir R. Flattery, blockhead! a dish too often served up by
paltry poor men to paltry rich ones.
ilum. I never serve it up to you.
Sir R. No, you give me a dish of a different description.
Hum. 1Iem! what is it?
Sir R. tSour-crout, you old crab.
Hum. I have held you a stout tug at argument this many
a year.
Sir R. And yet I could never teach you a +syllogism.
Now mind, when a poor man assents to what a rich man says,
I suspect he means to flatter him: now I am rich, and hate
flattery. Ergo--when a poor man subscribes to my opinion,
I hate him.
Hum. That's wrong.
Sir R. Very well; negatur; now prove it.
Hum. Put the case then, I am a poor man.
Sir R. You an't, you scoundrel. You know you shall
never want, while I have a shilling.
Hum. Well, then, I am a poor-I must be a poor man
now, or I never shall get on.
Sir R. Well, get on, be a poor man.
Hum. I am a poor man, and argue with you, and convince
you, you are wrong; then you call yourself a blockhead, and
I am of your opinion: now, that's no flattery.
Sir R. Why, no; but when a man's of the same opinion
with me, he puts an end to the argument, and that puts an
end to the conversation, and so I hate him for that. But
where's my nephew, Frederic?
Hum. Been out these two hours.
Sir R. An undutiful cub! Only arrived from Russia last235
night, and though I told him to stay at home till I rose, he's
scampering over the fields like a +Calmuc +Tartar.
Hum. He's a fine fellow.
Sir R. He has a touch of our family. Do n't you think
he is a little like me, Humphrey?
Hum. No, not a bit; you are as ugly an old man as ever I
clapped my eyes on.
Sir R. Now that's plaguy impudent, but there's no flattery
in it, and it keeps up the independence of argument. His
father, my brother Job, is of as tame a spirit. Humphrey,
you remember my brother Job?
Hum. Yes, you drove him to Russia five-and-twenty years
ago.
Sir R. I did not drive him.
Hum. Yes, you did. You would never let him be at peace
in the way of argument.
Sir R. At peace! Zounds, he would never go to war.
Hum. He had the merit to be calm.
Sir R. So has a duck-pond. He received my arguments
with his mouth open, like a poor-box gaping for half-pence,
and, good or bad, he swallowed them all without any resistance. We could n't disagree, and so we parted.
Hum. And the poor, meek gentleman went to Russia for
a quiet life.
Sir R. A quiet life! Why, he married the moment he got
there, tacked himself to the shrew trelict of a Russian merchant, and continued a tspeculation with her in furs, flax,
potashes, tallow, linen, and leather; what's the consequence?
Thirteen months ago he -broke..Hum. Poor soul, his wife should have followed the business for him.
Sir R. I fancy she did follow it, for she died just as he
broke, and now this madcap, Frederic, is sent over to me for
protection.  Poor Job, now he is in distress, I must not
neglect his son.
Hum. Here comes his son; that's Mr. Frederic.
Fred. Oh, my dear uncle, good morning! Your park is
nothing but beauty.
Sir R. Who bid you caper over my beauty? I told you
to stay in-doors till I got up.ARTICULATION.

NoTE.-After the pupil has been faithfully exercised in the foregoing table, it will be well to require him to explode all the vowel
elements in several sentences of every lesson he reads.
CONSONANT SOUNDS.
IT may, at first view, seem impossible to give the sound of
a consonant alone; but a few attempts will show, that although
it may be difficult, it is not impossible. It is true, they can
not be exploded with the force which vowel sounds admit, yet
they can all, except k,-t, and p, be pronounced without the
aid of vowels, and their sounds prolonged so as to give them
great distinctness.
Let the syllable ba be taken for example; and in pronouncing it, let the voice be suddenly suspended, before it passes to
the vowel. In this manner every consonant element should
be practiced upon, until the pupil can give the sound forcibly
and distinctly.  Without such practice it will be found impossible to utter with distinctness such combinations of consonants as the following, viz: waftedst, slumber'dst, search'dst,
lash'dst, &amp;c. Articulation is more frequently defective from
an imperfect utterance of the consonant sounds, than from
any other cause. These, therefore, require strict attention.NEW SIXTH READER.
Fred. So you did, but I entirely forgot it.
Sir R. And pray, what made you forget it?
Fred. The sun.
Sir R. The sun! he's mad! you mean the moon, I believe.
Fred. Oh, my dear uncle, you do n't know the effect of a
fine spring morning, upon a fellow just arrived from Russia.
The day looked bright, trees budding, birds singing, the
park was so gay, that I took a leap out of your old tbalcony,
mnade your deer fly before me like the wind, and chased them
all around the park to get an appetite for breakfast, while
you were snoring in bed, uncle.
Sir R. Oh, oh! So the effect of English sunshine upon
a Russian, is to make him jump out of a balcony and worry
my deer.
Fred. I confess it had that influence upon me.
Sir R. You had better be influenced by a rich old uncle,
unless you think the sun likely to leave you a fat *legacy.
Fred. I hate legacies.
Sir R. Sir, that's mighty singular. They are pretty solid
tokens, at least.
-Fred. Very melancholy tokens, uncle; they are tposthumous +dispatches, affection sends to gratitude, to inform us
we have lost a gracious friend.
Sir R. How charmingly the dog argues!
Fred. But I own my spirits ran away with me this morning. I will obey you better in future; for they tell me you
are a very worthy, good sort of gentleman.
Sir R. Now who had the +familiar timpudence to tell you
that?
Fred. Old rusty, there.
Sir R. Why, Humphrey, you did n't?
Hum. Yes, but I did though.
Fred. Yes, he did, and on that score I shall be anxions to
show you obedience, for't is as tmeritorious to attempt
sharing a good man's heart, as it is paltry to have designs
upon a rich man's money. A noble nature aims its attentions full breast high, uncle; a mean mind levels its dirty
+assiduities at the pocket.
Sir R. [Shaking him by the hand.] Jump out of every
window I have in the house; hunt my deer into high fevers,237
my fine fellow! Ay, that's right. This is spunk and plain
speaking. Give me a man, who is always flinging his tdissent to my doctrines smack in my teeth.
Fred. I disagree with you there, uncle.
Hum. And so do I.
Fred. You! you'forward puppy! If you were not so old,
I'd knock you down.
Sir R. I'11 knock you down, if you do. I won't have my
servants thumped into dumb flattery.
Hum. Come, you're ruffled. Let us go to the business of
the morning.
Sir R. I hate the business of the morning. Do n't you
see we are engaged in *discussion. I tell you, I hate the
business of the morning.
Hum. No you do n't.
Sir R. Do n't I?  Why not?
Hum. Because it's charity.
Sir R. Pshaw! Well, we must not neglect the business, if
there be any distress in the parish. Read the list, Humphrey.
Hum. [Taking out a paper and reading.]  "Jonathan
Huggins, of Muck Mead, is put in prison for debt."
Sir R. Why, it was only last week that Gripe, the attorney,
recovered two cottages for him by law, worth sixty pounds.
Hum. Yes, and charged a hundred for his trouble; so
seized the cottage for part of his bill, and threw Jonathan
into jail for the remainder.
Sir R. A harpy! I must relieve the poor fellow's distress.
Fred. And I must kick his attorney.
Hum. [Reading.] "'The curate's horse is dead."
Sir R. Pshaw! There's no distress in that.
Hum. Yes, there is, to a man that must go twenty miles
every Sunday, to preach, for thirty pounds a year.
Sir R. Why won't the vicar give him another nag?
Hum. Because its cheaper to get another curate already
mounted.
Sir R. Well, send him the black pad which I purchased
last Tuesday, and tell him to work him as long as he lives.
What else have we upon the list?
Hum. Something out of the common; there' s one Lieutenant Worthington, a disabled officer and widower, come to lodgeat farmer Harrowby's, in the village; he is, it seems, very
poor, and more proud than poor, and more honest than proud.
Sir R. And so he sends to me for assistance.
Hum. He'd see you hanged first! No, he'd sooner die than
ask you or any man for a shilling!  There's his daughter,
and his wife's aunt, and an old corporal that served in the
wars with him, he keeps them all upon his half-pay.
Sir R. Starves them all, I'm afraid, Humphrey.
Fred. [Going.] Good morning, uncle.
Sir R. You rogue, where are you running, now?
Fred. To talk with Lieutenant Worthington.
Sir R. And what may you be going to say to him?
Fred. I can't tell till I encounter him; and then, uncle,
when I have an old gentleman by the hand, who has been
disabled in his country's service, and is struggling to support
his motherless child, a poor relation, and a faithful servant
in honorable tindigence, impulse will supply  n,p with words
to express my sentiments.
Sir R. Stop you rogue; I must be before you in this
business.
Fred. That depends on who can run the fastest; so, start
fair, uncle, and here goes.-[Runs out.]
Sir R. Stop, stop; why, Frederic-a  *jackanapes-to
take my department out of my handsl I'll disinherit the
dog for his assurance.
Hum. No, you won't.
Sir R. Won't I?  Hang me if I-but we'll argue that
point as we go. So, come along Humphrey.
LXXXIX.- THE WELL OF ST. KEYNE.
FROM SOUTHEY.
ST. KEYNE was a Welch princess, who lived and died near the well
which was named after her. It was tpopularly believed, that she
laid upon this well the spell described in this ballad.
AN; an obsolete word meaning if.
1. A WELL there is in the West Country,
And a clearer one never was seen;
There is not a wife in the West Country,
But has: heard of the well of St. Keyne.
4w, 8.2. An oak and an elm tree stand beside,
And behind does an ash tree grow,
And a willow from the bank above,
Droops to the water below.
3. A traveler came to the well of St. Keyne:
Joyfully he drew nigh,
For from cock-crow he had been traveling,
And there was not a cloud in the sky.
4. He drank of the water, so cool and clear,
For thirsty and hot was he;
And he sat down upon the bank,
Under the willow tree.
5. There came a man from the neighboring town,
At the well to fill his pail;
On the well-side he rested it,
And he bade the stranger thail.
6. " Now art thou a bachelor, stranger?" quoth he;
"For an thou hast a wife,
The happiest draught thou hast drank this day
That ever thou didst in thy life.
7. "Or has thy good woman, if one thou hast,
"Ever here, in Cornwall been?
For an she have, I'll venture my life,
She has drunk of the well of St. Keyne."
8. "I have left a good woman, who never was here,
The stranger he made reply;
"But that my draught should be better for that,
I pray you answer me why."
9. "St. Keyne," +quoth the Cornish-man, "many a time
Drank of this +crystal well;
And before the angel summon'd her,
She laid on the water a spell.
10. "If the husband, of this gifted well
Shall drink before his wife,
A happy man thenceforth is he,
For he shall be master for life.
11.' But if the wife should drink of it first,
God help the husband then I"
The stranger stoop'd to the well of St. Keyne,
And drank of the water again.12. " You drank of the well, I warrant, +betimes "
He to the Cornish-man said:
But the Cornish-man smiled, as the stranger spake,
And sheepishly shook his head.
13. " I hasten'd, as soon as the wedding was done,
And left my wife in the porch;
But in faith! she had been wiser than I,
For she took a bottle to church."
XC.- THE FOLLY OF INTOXICATION.
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
CASSIO and IAGO.
lago. WHAT! are you hurt, lieutenant?
Cassio. Past all surgery.
la.go. Marry, Heaven forbid!
CGas. +Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have lost
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and
what remains is +bestial. My reputation! Iago, my reputation!
Iago. As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
some bodily wound: there is more sense in that than in
reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition:
oft got without merit, and lost without deserving. What,
man! there are ways to recover the general again. Sue to
him, and he's yours.
Cas.  I will rather sue to be despised. Drunk! and squabble! swagger! swear! and discourse tfustian with one's own
shadow! Oh, thou +invincible spirit of wine! if thou hast
no name to be known by, let us call thee devil.
lago. What was he that you followed with your sword?
What had he done to you?
Cas. I know not.
Iago. Is't possible'?
Cas. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that men should put
an enemy into their mouths, to steal away their brains: that
we should, with joy, gayety, revel, and applause, transform
ourselves into beasts I241
Iago. Why, but you are now well enough: how came you
thus recovered?
Cas. It has pleased the devil, Drunkenness, to give place
to the devil, Wrath; one imperfection shows me another, to
make me frankly despise myself.
Iago. Come, you are too severe a *moralizer. As the time,
the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could
heartily wish this had not befallen; but since it is as it is,
mend it for your own good.
Cas. If I ask him for my place again, he will tell me I am
a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an
answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by
and by a fool, and presently a beast! Every tinordinate cup
is unblessed, and the tingredient is a devil.
lago. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
if it be well used; exclaim no more against it. And, good
lieutenant, I think, you think I love you.
Cas. I have well approved it, sir. I, drunk!
Iago. You or any man living, may be drunk at some time,
man. I tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is
now the general. Confess yourself freely to her; +importune
her- help to put you in your place again. She is of so free,
so apt, so kind, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in
her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This
broken joint between you and her husband, entreat her to
splinter; and, my fortunes against any tlay worth naming,
this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
C(as. You advise me well.
Jago. I protest in all the sincerity of love and honest
kindness.
Cas. I think it fi'eely, and betimes in the morning, I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me.
lago. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I
must go to the watch.
Cas. Good night, honest Iago.

XCI.- AN ELEGY ON MADAM BLAIZE.
FROM GOLDSMITH.
1. GOOD people all, with one taccord,
Lament for Madam Blaize;
Who never wanted a good wordFrom those who spoke her praise.
2. The needy seldom pass'd her door,
And always found her kind;
She freely lent to all the poorWho left a pledge behind.
3. She strove the neighborhood to please,
With manner wondrous winning;
She never follow'd wicked waysUnless when she was sinning.
4. At church, in silks and satins new,
With +hoop of monstrous size,
She never slumber'd in her pewBut when she shut her eyes.
5. Her love was sought, I do aver,
By twenty beaux, or more;
The king himself has follow'd herWhen she has walk'd before.
6. But now, her wealth and +finery fled,
Her +hangers-on cut short all,
Her doctors found, when she was deadHer last disorder mortal.
7. Let us lament, in sorrow sore;
For Kent-street well may say,
That, had she liv'd a twelvemonth moreShe had not died to-day.
XCII.- THE EVILS OF WAR.
1. NOBODY sees a battle. The common soldier fires away
amid a smoke-mist, or hurries on to the charge in a crowd,
which hides every thing from  him.  The officer is too anxious about the tperformance of what he is +especially
charged with, to mind what others are doing. The commander can not be present every where, and see every wood,
watercourse, or +ravine, in which his orders are carried into
execution; he learns, from reports, how the work goes on.
It is well; for a battle is one of those jobs which men do,
without daring to look upon. Over miles of country, at every field-fence, in every tgorge of a valley, or entry into a
wood, there is murder committing, wholesale, continuous,
+reciprocal murder.  The human form, God's image, is +mutilated, deformed, tlacerated, in every possible way, and with
every variety of torture.  The wounded are jolted off in
carts to the rear, their bared nerves crushed into maddening pain at every stone or rut; or the flight and pursuit
trample over them, leaving them to writhe and groan, without assistance; and fever and thirst, the most enduring of
painful tsensations, possess them entirely.
2. Thirst, too, has seized upon the yet able-bodied soldier,
who with blood-shot eye and tongue lolling out, +plies his
trade; blaspheming; killing, with savage delight; callous,
when the brains of his best-loved comrade are spattered over
him! The battle-field is, if possible, a more painful object
of contemplation than the combatants. They are in their
+vocation, earning their bread: what will not men do for a
shilling a day? - But their work is carried on amid the fields,
gardens, and homesteads of men unused to war. They left
their homes, with all that habit and happy associations have
made precious, to bear its brunt. The poor, the aged, the
sick are left in a hurry, to be killed by stray shots or beaten
down as the charge or counter-charge go over them. The
ripening grain is trampled down: the garden is trodden ipto
a black mud; the fruit-trees, bending beneath their +luscious load, are shattered by the cannon-shot; churches and
private dwellings are used as fortresses, and ruined in the
+conflict; barns and +granaries take fire, and the conflagration spreads on all sides.
3. At night, the steed is stabled beside the altar, and the
weary +homicides of the day complete the wrecking  of
houses, to make their +lairs for slumber.  The fires of the
+bivouac complete what the fires kindled by the battle have
not consumed. The surviving soldiers march on, to act the
same scene over again, elsewhere; and the remnant of thescattered inhabitants return, to find the mangled bodies of
those they had loved, amid the blackened ruins of their
homes; to mourn, with more than agonizing grief, over the
missing, of whose fate they are uncertain; to feel themselves
bankrupts of the world's stores, and look from their children
to the desolate fields and garners, and think of famine and
pestilence, +engendered by the rotting bodies of the halfburied myriads of slain.
4. The soldier marches on and on, inflicting and suffering,
as before. War is a continuance of battles, an +epidemic,
striding from place to place, more horrible than the typhus,
pestilence, or cholera, which, not unfrequently follow in its
train. The siege is an aggravation of the battle. The peaceful inhabitants of the tbeleaguered town are cooped up, and
can not fly the place of conflict. The mutual injuries, inflicted by +assailants and assailed, are faggravated; their wrath
is more frenzied; then come the storm and the capture, and
the riot and excesses of the victor soldiery, striving to
quench the drunkenness of blood in the drunkenness of wine.
5. The +eccentric movements of war, the marching and
counter-marching, often repeat the blow on districts, slowly
recovering from  the first.  Between destruction  and the
wasteful consumption of the soldiery, poverty pervades the
land.  Hopeless of the future, hardened by the scenes of
which he is a daily witness, perhaps, goaded by revenge, the
peasant becomes a plunderer and assassin. The families of
the upper classes are +dispers3d; the discipline of the family
circle is removed; a habit of living in the day, for the day,
of drowning the morrow in transient and +illicit pleasure, is
tengendered. The waste and desolation which a battle spreads
over the battle-field, is as nothing, when compared with the
moral desolation which war diffuses through all ranks of
society, in the country which is the scene of war.XCIII. - THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES.
FROM JANE TAYLOR.
1. A MONK, when his rites tsacerdotal were o'er,
In the depth of his cell with his stone-cover'd floor,
Resigning to thought his tchimerical brain,
Once form'd the contrivance we now shall explain;
But whether by magic's or talchemy's powers,
WTe know not; indeed,'t is no business of ours.
2. Perhaps, it was only by;patience and care,
At last, that he brought his inventions to bear;
In youth't was tprojected, but years stole away,
And ere't was complete, he was wrinkled and gray;
But success is secure, unless energy fails;
And, at length, he produced the philosopher's scales.
3. "What were they?" you ask. You shall presently see;
These scales were not made to weigh sugar and tea;
O no; for such tproperties wondrous had they,
That qualities, feelings, and thoughts, they could weigh;
Together with articles small or immense,
From mountains or planets, to tatoms of sense.
4. Naught was there so bulky, but there it would lay,
And naught so +ethereal, but there it would stay,
And naught so treluctant, but in it must go:
All which some examples more clearly will show.
5. The first thing he weigh'd was the head of Voltaire,
Which retain'd all the wit that had ever been there;
As a weight he threw in a torn scrap of a leaf,
Containing the prayer of the tpenitent thief;
When the skull rose aloft with so sudden a spell,
That it bounced like a ball on the roof of the cell.
6. One time, he put in Alexander the Great,
With a garment that Dorcas had made for a weight,
And, though tclad in armor from tsandals to crown,
The hero rose up,'and the garment went down.
7. A long row of alms-houses, amply tendow'd
By a well-esteem'd tPharisee, busy and proud,
Next loaded one scale; while the other was prest
By those mites the poor widow dropp'd into the chest;
Up flew the +endowment, not weighing an ounce,
And down, down the farthing-worth came with a bounce.21
The following are the consonant elements susceptible of explosive force in a greater or less degree.
b as heard in babe.
d,,    dead.
f,,     fiefi
g,,    gag.
h,,    hat.
j,,     jade, large.
1,,     loll.
m,,     main.
n,,     noon.
r,,    roar.
s,,     sap, pass.
v as heard in value.
y,,     yes.
z,,     zeal, adz.
ng,,     ring.
th,,     thine, tithe.
th,,     thrust, north.
ch,,     church.
sh,,     shine, dash.
wh,,     what, whine.
zh,,. azure.
When the pupil has acquired some facility in exploding the
foregoing consonant elements, it will be found profitable to
require him to combine with each of them, one of the vowel
elements, giving the utmost prolongation to the consonant
sound; thus, ab-b; eb-b; ib--b; ad-d; ed-d; id-d;
&amp;c., &amp;c. Then let him go over the same exercise, placing the
consonant first; thus, b-be; d-de; g-ga; rn-mo, &amp;c.

8. By further texperiments, (no matter how,)
He found that ten chariots weigh'd less than one plow;
A sword with gilt trapping rose up in the scale,
Though balanced by only a ten-penny nail;
A shield and a helmet, a buckler and spear,
Weigh'd less than a widow's funcrystalized tear.
9. A lord and a lady went up at full sail,
When a bee chanced to light on the opposite scale;
Ten doctors, ten lawyers, two courtiers, one earl,
Ten counselors' wigs, full of powder and curl,
All heap'd in one balance and swinging from thence,
Weigh'd less than a few gra'ins of tcandor and sense;
10. A first water tdiamond, with +brilliants begirt,
Than one good potato, just wash'd from the dirt;
Yet not mountains of silver and gold could suffice,
One pearl to outweigh,'t was the pearl of great price.
11. Last of all, the whole world was bowl'd in at the grate,
With the soul of a beggar to serve for a weight,
When the former sprang up with so strong a trebuff,
That it made a vast rent and escaped at the roof;
When, balanced in air, it ascended on high,
And sail'd up aloft, a balloon in the sky;
While the scale with the soul in't so mightily fell,
That it jerk'd the +philosopher out of his cell.
XCIV. - ORIGIN OF PROPERTY.
FROM BLACKSTONE.
1. IN the beginning of the world, we are informed by
holy writ, the all-bountiful Creator gave to man " dominion
over all the earth; and over the fishes of the sea, and over
the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moved
upon the earth." This is the only true and solid foundation
of man's dominion over external things, whatever airy, +metaphysical notions may have been started by fanciful writers
on this subject. The earth, therefore, and-all things therein,
are the general property of mankind, +exclusive of other
beings, from  the immediate gift of the Creator.  And while
the earth continued bare of inhabitants, it is reasonable tosuppose that all was in common among them, and that every
one took from the public stock, to his own use, such things
as his immediate necessities required.
2. These general notions of property were then sufficient
to answer all purposes of human life; and might, perhaps,
still have answered them, had it been possible for mankind
to have remained in a state of tprimeval simplicity, in which
" all things were common to him." Not that this communion
of goods seems ever to have been applicable, even in the earliest stages, to aught but the substance of the thing; nor
could it be extended to the use of it. For, by the law of
nature and reason, he who first began to use it, acquired
therein, a kind of ttransient property, that lasted so long as
he was using it, and no longer. Or, to speak with greater
+precision, the right of possession continued for the same time,
only, that the act of possession lasted.
3. Thus, the ground was in common, arid no part of it
was the property of any man in particular; yet, whoever was
in the occupation of any determined spot of it, for rest, for
shade, or the like, acquired for the time, a sort of ownership,
fromn which, it would have been unjust and contrary to the
law of nature, to have driven him by force; but, the instant
he quitted the use or occupation of it, another might seize it
without injustice. Thus, also, a vine or a tree might be said
to be in common, as all men were equally entitled to its
produce; and yet, any private individual might gain the sole
property of the fruit which he had gathered for his own
repast: a doctrine well illustrated by Cicero, who compares
the world to a great theater which is common to the public,
and yet the place which any man has taken, is, for the time,
his own.
4. But when mankind increased in number, +craft, and
ambition, it became necessary to entertain +conceptions of a
more permanent dominion; and to tappropriate to individuals,
not the immediate use only, but the very substance of the
thing to be used. Otherwise, innumerable tumults must have
arisen, and the good order of the world been continually
broken and disturbed, while a variety of persons were striving
who should get the first occupation of the same thing, or disputing which of them had actually gained it. As human lifeNEW SIXTH READER.
grew more and more refined, many conveniences were devised
to render it more easy, commodious, and agreeable; as habitations for shelter and safety, and raiment for warmth and
decency. But no man would be at the trouble to provide
either, so long as he had only an tusufructuary property in
them, which was to cease the instant that he quitted possession; if, as soon as he walked out of his tent or pulled off his
garment, the next stranger who came by would have a right
to inhabit the one and to wear the other.
5. In the case of habitations, in particular, it was natural
to observe that even the brute creation, to whom every thing
else was in common, maintained a kind of permanent property
in their dwellings, especially for the protection of their young;
that the birds of the air had nests, and the beasts of the fields
had caverns, the invasion of which they esteemed a very
+flagrant injustice, and in the preservation of which, they
would sacrifice their lives. IHence a property was soon established in every man's house and thomestead; which seem to
have been originally mere temporary huts or movable cabins,
suited to the design of Providence for more speedily peopling
the earth, and to the wandering life of their owners, before
any extensive property in the soil or ground was established.
6. There can be no doubt but that movables of every kind
became sooner appropriated than the tpermanent, substantial
soil; partly because they were more +susceptible of a long
occupancy, which might be eontinued for months together,
without any sensible interruption, and at length, by usage,
ripen into an established right; but, principally, because few
of them could be fit for use, till improved and +meliorated
by the bodily labor of the occupant; which bodily labor,
bestowed upon any subject that lay in common to all men, is
universally allowed to give the fairest and most reasonable
title to an exclusive property therein.
7. The article of food was a more immediate call, and
therefore a more early consideration. Such as were not contented with the +spontaneous products of the e~arth, sought for
a more solid refreshment in the flesh of beasts, which they
obtained by hunting.  But the frequent disappointments
incident to that method of provision, induced them to gather
together such animals as were of a more tame and +sequacious249
nature, and to establish a more permanent property in their
flocks and herds, in order to sustain themselves in a less tprecarious manner, partly by the milk of the dams, and partly
by the flesh of the young.
8. The support of these their cattle, made the article of
water also a very important point. And, therefore, the book
of Genesis, (the most venerable monument of tantiquity,
considered merely with a view to history,) will furnish us with
frequent instances of violent contentions concerning wells; the
exclusive property of which appears to have been established
in the first digger or occupant, even in places where the
ground and +herbage remained yet in common. Thus, we
find Abraham, who was but a sojourner, asserting his right
to a well in the country of Abimelech, and exacting an oath
for security, " because he had digged that well." And Isaac,
about ninety years afterward, reclaimed this his father's property; and, after much contention with the Philistines, was
suffered to enjoy it in peace.
9. All this while, the soil and pasture of the earth, remained still in common as before, and open to every occupant;
except, perhaps, in the neighborhood of towns, where the
necessity of a sole and exclusive property in lands, (for the
sake of agriculture,) was earlier felt, and therefore more
readily complied with. Otherwise, when the multitude of
men and cattle had consumed every convenience on one spot
of ground, it was deemed a natural right to seize upon, and
occupy such other lands, as would more easily supply their
necessities.
10. We have a striking example of this, in the history of
Abraham and his nephew Lot.  When their joint substance
became so great, that pasture and other conveniences grew
scarce, the natural consequence was, that a strife arose between their servants; so that it was no longer +practicable to
dwell together. This contention, Abraham thus endeavored
to compose: " Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me
and thee. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou wilt take the left hand,
then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right
hand, then I will go to the left." This plainly implies an
acknowledged right in either, to occupy whatever ground heNEW SIXTH READER.
pleased, that was not pre-occupied by other tribes. "And
Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
that it was well watered every where, even as the garden of
the Lord. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan, and
journeyed east; and Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan."
11. As the world grew by degrees more populous, it daily
became more difficult to find out new spots to inhabit, without
encroaching upon former occupants; and, by constantly occupying the same individual spot, the fruits of the earth were
consumed, and its spontaneous products destroyed, without
any provision for future supply or succession. It, therefore,
became necessary to pursue some regular method of providing
a constant subsistence; and this necessity produced, or at
least promoted and encouraged the art of agriculture. And
the art of agriculture, by a regular connection and consequence, introduced and established the idea of a more permanent property in the soil, than had hitherto been received
and adopted.
12. It was clear, that the earth would not produce her
fruits in sufficient quantities, without the assistance of ttillage; but who would be at the pains of tilling it, if another
might watch an opportunity to seize upon and enjoy the
product of his industry, art, and labor?. Had not, therefore,
a separate property in lands, as well as movables, been vested
in some individuals, the world must have continued a forest,
and men have been mere animals of prey. Whereas, now,
(so graciously has providence interwoven our duty and our
happiness together,) the result of this very necessity has been
the ennobling of the human species, by giving it opportunities
of improving its rational, as well as of exerting its natural
faculties.
13. Necessity begat property; and, in order to insure that
property, recourse was had to civil society, which brought
along with it a long train of inseparable tconcomitants;
states, government, laws, punishments, and the public exercise of religious duties. Thus connected together, it was
found that a part only of society was sufficient to provide, by
their manual labor, for the necessary subsistence of all; and
leisure was given to others to cultivate the human mind, to
invent useful arts, and to lay the foundations of science.XCV.- BRITISH REFUGEES.
FROM PATRICK HENRY.
EXTRACT from a speech delivered in the Legislature of Virginia, in
favor of permitting the British +refugees, or those who had joined the
English party in the war of independence, to return to the United
States.
1. WE have, Mr. Chairman, an extensive country without
population. What can be a more obvious policy, than that
this country ought to be peopled? People form the strength
and constitute the wealth of a nation. I want to see our
vast forests filled up, by some process a little more speedy
than the ordinary course of nature. I wish to see these,
states rapidly ascending to that rank, which their natural
advantages authorize them to hold among the nations of the
earth.  Cast your eyes over this extensive country.  Observe
the tsalubrity of your climate; the variety and fertility of
your soil; and see that soil interseeted in every quarter, by
bold, navigable streams, flowing to the east and to the west,
as if the finger of heaven were marking out the course of your
settlements, inviting you to enterprise, -and pointing the way
to wealth.
2. Sir, you are destined, at some period or other, to become a great agricultural and +commercial people: the only
question is, whether you choose to reach this point by slow
tgradations, and at some distant period, lingering on through
a long and sickly +minority, subjected meanwhile to the
machinations, insults, and oppression of enemies, foreign and
domestic, without sufficient strength to resist and chastise
them; or whether you choose rather to rush at once, as it
were, to the full enjoyment of those high destinies, and be
able to +cope, single-handed, with the proudest +oppressor of
the world.
3. If you prefer the latter course, as I trust you do,
encourage +emigration; encourage the husbandmen, the mechanics, the merchants of the old world to come and settle in
the land of promise. Make it the home of the skillful, the
fortunate, and the happy, as well as the +asylum  of the distressed. Fill up the measure of your population as speedily
as you can, by the means which Heaven has placed in yourpower; and I venture to prophesy there are now those living,
who will see this favored land among the most powerful on
earth; able to take care of herself, without resorting to that
pblicy so dangerous, though sometimes unavoidable, of calling
in foreign aid. Yes, they will see her great in arts and in
arms; her golden harvests waving over fields of immeasurable extent; her commerce *penetrating the most distant
seas; and her cannon silencing the vain boast of those who
now proudly affect to rule the waves.
4. Instead of refusing permission to the refugees to return,
it is your true policy to encourage temigration to this country, by every means in your power. Sir, you must have men.
You can not get along without them. Those heavy forests of
timber, under which your lands are groaning, must be cleared
away. Those vast riches which cover the face of your soil,
as well as those which lie hid in its bosom, are to be developed and gathered only by the skill and enterprise of men.
Your timber must be worked up into ships, to ttransport the
productions of the soil, and find the best markets for them
abroad. Your great want is the want of men; and these you
must have, and will have speedily, if you are wise.
5. Do you ask, how you are to get them? Open your
doors, sir, and they will come. The population of the old
world is full to overflowing. That population is ground, too,
by the oppressions of the governments under which they live.
They are already standing on tiptoe upon their native shores,
and looking to your coasts with a wishful and longing eye.
They see here, a land blessed with natural and tpolitical
advantages, which are not equaled by those of any other
country on earth; a land, on which a gracious Providence
hath emptied the horn of abundance; a land, over which
peace hath now stretched forth her white wings, and where
content and plenty lie down at every door.
6. They see something still more tattractive than this.
They see a land in which Liberty has taken up her abode;
that Liberty whom they had considered a fabled goddess, existing only in the fancies of the poets. They ste her here, a
real +divinity; her altars rising on every hand, throughout
these happy states; her glories tchanted by three millions of
tongues; and the whole region smiling under her blessedinfluence. Let but this +celestial goddess, Liberty, stretch
forth her fair hand toward the people of the old world, tell
them to come and bid them welcome; and you will see them
pouring in from ttle north, from the south, from the east, and
from the west. Your wilderness will be cleared and settled;
your deserts will smile; your ranks will be filled; and you will
soon be in a condition to defy the powers of any adversary.
7. But gentlemen object to any taccession from Great
Britain, and particularly to the return of the Britia]&amp; refugees.
Sir, I feel no objection to the return of those deluded
people. They have, to be sure, mistaken their own interests
most wonderfully, and most woefully have they suffered the
punishment due to their offenses. But the relations which
we bear to them and to their native country, are now changed.
Their king has acknowledged our +independence. The quarrel
is over. Peace has returned, and found us a free people.
8. Let us have the magnanimity to lay aside our tantipathies and prejudices, and consider the subject in a political
light. They are an enterprising, moneyed people.  They
will be serviceable in taking off the surplus produce of our
lands, and supplying us with necessaries during the infant
state of our +manufactures. Even if they be +inimical to us,
in point of feeling and principle, I can see no objection, in a
political view, to making them ttributary to our advantage.
And as I have no prejudices to prevent my making use of
them, so I have no fear of any mischief they can do us.
Afraid of them!  What, sir, shall we, who; have laid the
proud British lion at our feet, now be afraid of his whelps?
CXVI.-ANTONY OVER CGESAR'S DEAD BODY.
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
FRIENDS, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Ceesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do, lives after them;
The good is oft +inter-red with their bones;
So let it be with Cxesar! The noble Brutus
Hath told you, Coesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Cosar aaswer'd it.Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,
(For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men;)
Come I to speak on Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general +coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff;
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see, that on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious,
And sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spake,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause;
What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason! Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin, there, with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
But yesterday, the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him +reverence.
O masters! if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men:
I will not do them wrong. I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a +parchment with the seal of Ceesar;
I found it in his closet,'t is his will;
Let but the Commons hear this 1testament,
(Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,)
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;255
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich +legacy
Unto their issue.
One of the people. We'll hear the will: read it.
All. The will, the will; we will hear Caesar's will.
Ant. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Caesar lov'd you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad.'T is good you know not that you are his heirs;
For if you should, 0, what would come of it!
People. Read the will; we will hear it, Antony;
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
Ant. Will you be patient?  Will you wait awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
I fear I wrong the honorable men,
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar. I do fear it.
Ole of the people. They were traitors: honorable men?
All. The will! The testament!
Ant. You will compel me then to read the will.
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
[He comes down firom the pulpit.]
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The.first time ever Caesar put it on;'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii;
Look! in this place, ran Cassius' dagger through!
See, what a rent the envious Casca made;
Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And, as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it.
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For, when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him; then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Great Caesar fell.
Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen I
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,He gasped for breath.
I'11 grapple with my country's foes.
His limbs were strengthened by exercise.
They cultivated shrubs and plants.
He has marshaled his hosts.
He selected his texts with great care.
The unsearched mine hath not such gems.
His lips grow restless, and his smile is curled half into scorn.
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
And all her paths are peace.
He has singed his hair.
What further wait'st thou for?
She milked six cows.
Give me a yard and three eighths.
Ha! laugh'st thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn?
The chill precincts of the narrow house.
Oh! breeze that waft'st me on my way.
Thou prob'dst his wounds too freely.
Thou begg'dst in vain for mercy.
Thou wrong'dst thyself and me.
Thou troubl'dst thy father's friends.
Vaunt'st thou thyself of thy strength!
Thou boast'st of what should be thy shame.
Thou pluc/c'dst a bitter fruit.
Disabl'dst strangl'dst, burn'dst.
Clasp'dst, twinkl'dst, respect't.
Lash'dst, haggl'dst, swerv'dst..
From depths unknown, unsearchable, profound.
Forth rushed the wandering comets girt with flames.
When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,
The line too labors and the words move slow.
One blast upon his bugle-horn were worth ten thousand men.
Life's* fitful fever over, he rests well.
This sculptor has e;ecuted three busts.
From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,
Leaps the live thunder; notfrom one lone cloud;
But Avery mountain now hath found a tongue,
And Jura answe rsfrom her misty shroud,
Back to the joyous Alps, which call to her aloud.

XCVII. -- THE DISCONITZJ) -iPEN) ULUM,
FROMi 5JAIE TAYLOR.
1. AN old clock, that had stood for fifty years in a tarmer's kitchen, without giving its owner any cause of complaint, early one summer's mqrning, before the family was
stirring, suddenly stopped.  Upon this, the dial plate (if we
may credit the fable) changed countenance with alarm; the257
hands made a vain effort to continue their course; the
wheels remained motionless with surprise; the weights hung
speechless; and each member felt disposed to lay the blame
on the others. At length the dial instituted a formal inquiry
as to the cause of the tstagnation; when hands, wheels,
weights, with one voice, protested their innocence.
2. But now, a faint tick was heard below, from the +pendulum, who thus spoke: " I confess myself to be the sole cause
of the present stoppage; and I am willing for the general
+satisfaction, to assign my reasons. The truth is, that I am
tired of ticking." Upon hearing this, the old clock became
so enraged, that it was on the very point of striking.  " Lazy
wire!" exclaimed the dial-plate, holding up  its hands.
"Very good!" replied the pendulum; "It is vastly easy for
you, Mistress Dial, who have always, as every body knows,
set yourself up above me, it is vastly easy for you, I say, to
accuse other people, of laziness! you, who have had nothing
to do, all your life, but to stare people in the face, and to
amuse yourself with watching all that goes on in the kitchen.
Think, I beseech you, how you would like to be shut up for
life in this dark closet, and to wag backward and forward,
year after year, as I do."
3. t" As to that," said the dial, " is there not a window in
your house, on purpose f6r you to look through?"  "For all
that," resumed the pendulum, "it is very dark here; and,
although there is a window, I dare not stop even for an
instant, to look out at it. Besides, I am really tired of my
way of life; and if you wish, I'11 tell you how I took this
-disgust to my employment. I happened, this morning, to be
tcalculating, how many times I should have to tick in the
course of only the next twenty-four hours; perhaps some one
of you, above there, can give me the exact sum."
4. The minute hand  beingo quick at figures, presently
replied, "Eighty-six thousand, four hundred times."' Exactly so," replied the pendulum. "' Well, I tappeal to you
all, if the very thought of this was not enough to fatigue any
one; and when I began to multiply the strokes of one day
by those of months and years, really it is no wonder if I felt
discouraged at the prospect. So, after a great deal of reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to myself, I'11 stop."
22NEW SIXTH READER.
5. The dial could scarcely keep its countenance during
this +harangue; but resuming its gravity, thus replied:
"Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am really astonished that such a
useful, industrious person as yourself, should have been
seized by this sudden weariness. It is true, you have done
a great deal of work in your time; so have we all, and are
likely to do; which, although it may fatigue us to think of,
the question is, whether it will fatigue us to do. Would you
now do mne the favor to give about half a dozen strokes, to
tillustrate my argument?"
6. The pendulum complied, and ticked six times at its
usual pace. "Now," resumed the dial, " may I be allowed to
inquire if that texertion is at all fatiguing or disagreeable to
you?   "Not in the least," replied the pendulum; "it is not
of six strokes that I complain, nor of sixty, but of millions."
"Very good," replied the dial; "but recollect that, although
you may think of a million of strokes in an instant, you are
required to +execute but one; and that, however often you
may hereafter have to swing, a moment will be always given
you to swing in."  "That tconsideration staggers me, I confess," said the pendulum. "Then I hope," resumed the dialplate, "that we shall all return to our duty immediately; for
the maids will lie in bed, if we stand idling thus.'
7. Upon this, the weights, who had never been accused
of light conduct, used all their influence in urging him to
proceed: when, as if with one consent, the wheels began to
turn, the hands began to move, the pendulum began to swing,
and, to its credit, ticked as loud as ever; while a red beam of
the rising sun, that streamed through a hole in the kitchen,
shining full upon the dial-plate, it brightened up as if nothing had been the matter.
8. When the farmer came down to breakfast that morning, upon looking at the clock, he declared that his watch had
gained half an hour in the night.
MORAL.
9. A celebrated +modern writer says, "Take care of the
minutes, and the hours will take care of themselves."  This
is an admirable remark, and might be very seasonably recollected, when we begin to be "weary in well-doing," from the259
thought of having too much to do. The present moment is
all we have to do with in any sense; the past is tirrecoverable, the future is uncertain; nor is it fair to burden one
moment with the weight of the next. Sufficient unto the
moment is the trouble thereof.  If we had to walk a hundred
miles, we still should have to set but one step at a time; and
this process continued, would tinfallibly bring us to our
journey's end.  Fatigue generally begins, and is always
increased, by calculating, in a minute, the exertion of hours.
10. Thus, in looking forward to future life, let us recollect
that we have not to sustain all its toil, to endure all its sufferings, or encounter all its crosses, at once. One moment
comes laden with its own little burdens, then flies, and is succeeded by another no heavier than the last. If one could be
borne, so can another and another. Even looking forward to
a single day, the spirit may sometimes faint from an +anticipation of the duties, the labors, the trials to temper and
patience that may be expected. Now this is unjustly laying
the burden of many thousand moments upon one. Let any
one resolve always to do right now, leaving then to do as
it can, and if he were to live to the age of tMethuselah, he
would never do wrong. But the common error is to resolve
to act right after breakfast, or after dinner, or to-morrow
morning, or next time; but now, just now, this once, we must
go on the same as ever.
11. It is easy, for instance, for the most ill-tempered person to resolve, that the next time he is provoked, he will not
let his temper overconTe him; but the victory would be to
subdue temper on. the present tprovocation.  If, without
taking up the burden of the future, we would always make
the single effort at the present moment, while there would be,
at any one time, very little to do, yet, by this simple tprocess,
continued from day to day, every thing would at last be done.
12. It seems easier to do right to-morrow than to-day,
merely because we forget, that when to-morrow comes, thent
will be now. Thus life passes with many, with resolutions
for the future, which the present never fulfills. It is not
thus with those, who, "by patient continuance in well-doing,
seek for glory, honor, and +immortality." Day by day, minute by minute, they execute the appointed task, to which therequisite measure of time and strength is proportioned; and
thus, having worked while it is called day, they at length,
"rest from their labors, and their works follow them." Let
us then, whatever our hands find to do, do it with all our
might, recollecting that now is the proper and accepted time.
XCVIII. -THE NOSE AND THE EYES.
FROM COWPER.
WILLIAM COWPER, an English poet, was born in 1731. His poetry exhibits
a mixture of playful humor, and of the somber melancholy which darkened the
latter part of his life. In beauty and delicacy of thought, and in his high
tone of moral and religious sentiment, he has no superior among English
poets. He died in 1800.
1. BETWEEN Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;
The spectacles set them, unhappily wrong;
The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,
To which the said spectacles ought to belong.
2. So Tongue was the lawyer, and +argued the cause,
With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning,
While chief baron Ear, sat to balance the laws,
So famed for his talent in nicely +discerning.
3. " In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,
And your lordship," he said, "will undoubtedly find,
That the Nose has the spectacles always to wear,
Which amounts to possession, time out of mind."
4. Then, holding the spectacles up to the court,
"Your lordship observes, they are made with a straddle,
As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,
Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.
5. "Again, would your lordship a moment suppose,
('T is a case that has happen'd, and may happen again,)
That, the +visage or countenance had not a Nose,
Pray, who would, or who could wear spectacles then?
6. "On the whole it appears, and my +argument shows,
With a reasoning the court will never condemn,
That the spectacles, plainly, were made for the Nose,
And the Nose was, as plainly, intended for them."
7. Then shifting his side, (as a lawyer knows how,)
He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes:26'1
But what were his arguments, few people know,
For the court did not think them equally wise.
8. So his lordship decreed, with a grave, solemn tone,
Decisive and clear, without one if or but,
That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,
By day-light or candle-light,--Eyes should be shut.
XCIX. -GRATEFUL OLD AGE.
FROM THE GERMAN OF GESNER.
1. How beautifully the dawn shines through the hazelbush, and the wild roses blossom at the window! How joyfully the swallow sings on the rafter, under my roof, and the
little lark in the high air!  Every thing is cheerful, and
every plant is revived in the dew.  I also feel revived. My
staff shall guide my tottering steps to the threshold of my
cottage, and there will I sit down facing the rising sun, and
look abroad on the green meadows.  How beautiful is all
around me here! All that I hear are voices of joy and
thanks. The birds in the air and the shepherds on the hill,
sing their delight, and the flocks from the grassy slopes and
out of the +variegated valleys, bellow out their joy.
2. How long, how long, shall I yet be a witness of divine
goodness? Ninety times, have I already seen the change of
the seasons; and when I look back from the present hour to
the time of my birth,-a beautiful and extended prospect
which, at last, is lost in pure air,--how swells my heart! The
temotion, which my tongue can not utter, is it not rapture?
And are not these tears, tears of joy?  And yet, are not both
too feeble an expression of thanks? Ah! flow, ye tears!
flow down these cheeks!
3. When I look back, it seems as if I had lived only through
a long spring, my sorrowful hours being only short storms,
which refreshed the fields and enlivened the plants. Hurtful
tpestilences have never diminished our flocks; never has a
tmischance happened to our trees, nor a lingering misfortune
rested on this cottage. I looked out tenraptured into futurity,
when my children played smiling in my arms, or when my
hand guided their tottering footsteps. With tears of joy INEW SIXTH READER.
looked out into the future, when I saw these young sprouts
spring up.' I will protect them from mischance," said I, " I
will watch over their growth, and heaven will bless my endeavors. They will grow up and bear excellent fruit, and
become trees, which shall shelter my declining age with their
spreading branches."
4. So I spake, and pressed them to my heart, and now,
they have grown up, full of blessings, covering my weary years
with their refreshing shade.  So, the apple-trees, the peartrees, and the tall nut-trees, planted by me while yet a boy,
around my cottage, have grown up, carrying their widelyextended branches high into the air; and my little home
nestles in their, covering shade.  This, this was my most
tvehement grief, O Myrta, when thou didst expire on my
agitated breast, within my arms.  Spring has already covered
thy grave, twelve times, with flowers. But the day approaches,'
a joyful day, when my bones shall be laid with thine. Perhaps, the coming night conducts it hither. 0, I see with
delight, how my gray beard flows down over my breast Yes,
play with the white hair on my breast, thou little tzephyr,
who +hoverest about me! It is as worthy of thy +caresses, as
the golden hair of joyful youth, or the brown curls on the
neck of the blooming maiden.
5. -This day shall be to me a day of joy! I will assemble
my children around me here, even down to the little tstammering grand-child, and will offer thanksgiving to God; the
altar shall be here before my cottage. I will tgarland my
bald head, and my trembling hand shall take the lyre, and
then will we, I and my children, sing songs of praise. Then,
will I tstrew flowers over my table, and, with joyful tdiscourses, partake of the bounty of the Most High.
6. Thus spake Palsemon, and rose trembling upon his staff;
and having called his children together, held a glad tfestival
of devout and joyous tthanksgiving to the Deity.C.  THE THREE WARNINGS.
FROM MRS. THRALE.
1. THE tree of deepest root is found
Least willing still to quit the ground;'T was therefore said, by ancient tsages,
That love of life increas'd with years,
So much, that in our latter stages,
When pains grow sharp and sickness rages,
The greatest love of life appears.
This great affection to believe,
Which all confess, but few perceive,
If old tassertions can't prevail,
Be pleas'd to hear a modern tale.
2. When sports went round, and all were gay,
On neighbor Dobson's wedding day;
Death call'd aside the tjocund groom
With him into another room;
And looking grave, " You must," says he,
" Quit your sweet bride, and come with me."
"With you? and quit my Susan's side?
With you?" the hapless bridegroom cried:
" Young as I am,'t is monstrous hard!
Besides, in truth, I'm not prepared."
3. What more he urged, I have not heard;
His reasons could not well be stronger:
So Death the poor tdelinquent spared,
And left to live a little longer.
Yet calling up a serious look,
His hour-glass trembled, while he spoke;
"Neighbor," he said, "farewell; no more
Shall Death disturb your tmirthful hour,
And further, to avoid all blame
Of cruelty upon my name,
To give you time for +preparation,
And fit you for your future station,
Three several warnings you shall have,
Before you're summon'd to the grave:
Willing, for once, I'll quit my prey,
And grant a kind treprieve;
In hopes you'11 have no more to say,But when I call again this way,
Well pleas'd, the world will leave."
To these Iconditions both consented,
And parted, perfectly contented.
4. What next the hero of our tale befell,
How long he liv'd, how wisely and how well,
It boots not, that the muse should tell;
He plow'd, he'sowed, he bought, he sold,
Nor once perceiv'd his growing old,
Nor thought of Death as near;
His friends not false, his wife no +shrew,
Many his gainis, his children few,
He pass'd his hours in peace:
But, while he view'd his wealth increase,
While thus along life's dusty road,
The beaten track, content he trod,
Old Time, whose haste no mortal spares,
Uncall'd, unheeded, +unawares,
Brought on his eightieth year.
5. And now, one night, in musing mood
As all alone he sat,
The unwelcome messenger of Fate
Once more before him stood.
Half kill'd with wonder and surprise,
"So soon return'd!" old Dobson cries.
"So soon d' ye call it?" Death replies:
"Surely my friend, you're but in jest;
Since I was here before,'T is six and thirty years at-least,
And you are now four-score."
"So much the worse!" the clown +rejoin'd;
" To spare the a-ged would be kind:
Besides, you promis'd me three warnings,
Which I have looked for, nights and mornings!"
6. "I know," cries Death, "that at the best,
I seldom am a welcome guest;
But do n't be +captious, friend; at least,
I little thought that you'd be able
To stump about your farm and stable;
Your years have run to a great length,
Yet still you seem to have your strength."
7. "Hold!" says the farmer, "not so fast;
I have been lame, these four years past."
264"And no great wonder," Death replies;
"IIowever, you still keep your eyes;
And surely, sir, to see one's friends,
For legs and arms would make aniends."
" Perhaps," says Dobson, " so it might,
But latterly I've lost my sight."
"This is a shocking story, faith;
But there's some comfort still," says Death;
Each strives your sadness to amuse;
I warrant you hear all the news."
"There's none," cries he, "and if there were,
I've grown so deaf, I could not hear."
8. "Nay, then," the +specter stern rejoin'd,
" These are unpardonable tyearnings;
If you are lame, and deaf; and blind,
You'e had your three sufficient warnings;
So, come along! no more we'll part:"
IIe said, and touch'd him with his dart:
And now, old Dobson, turning pale,
Yields to his fate-so ends my tale.
CI. - THE MEMORY OF OUR FATHERS.
FROM DR. BEECHER.
1. WE are called upon to cherish with high veneration
and grateful recollections, the memory of our fathers. Both
the ties of nature and the dictates of +policy, demand this.
And surely, no nation had ever less occasion to be ashamed
of its ancestry, or more occasion for +gratulation in that
respect; for while most nations trace their origin to +barbarians, the foundations of our nation were laid by civilized
men, by Christians. Many of them were men of distinguished families, of powerful talents, of great learning and
of tpre-eminent wisdom, of decision of character, and of most
inflexible integrity. And yet not unfrequently, they have
been treated as if they had no virtues; while their sins and follies, have been +sedulously immortalized in tsatirical anecdote.
2. The influence of such treatment of our fathers is too
+manifest. It creates, and lets loose upon their institutions,
23The swift dark whirlwind that uproots the woods,
Where is the mortal, that forgets not at the sight
Of these tremendous tokens of thy power
His pride, and lays his* strifes and follies by?
Canst thou fill his* skin with barbed irons.
He was distinguished for his conscientiousness.
From star to star the living lightningsflash,
And falling thunders through all space proclaim
The goings forth of Him whose potent armn
Perpetuates* existence or destroys.
God journeyeth* in the heavens. Refulgent stars
And glittering crowns of prostrate seraphim
Emboss* his burning path. Around* him fall
Dread powers, dominions, hosts, and kingly thrones.
That morning, thou that slumber'dst not before,
Nor sleep'st, great Ocean, laid'st thy waves* at rest,
Anid hush'dst thy mighty minstrelsy.

II. INFLECTIONS.
INFLECTION is a bending, or sliding of the voice either
upward or downward..
The upward, or rising inflection, is marked by the
acuteaccent,thus, ('); and in this case the voice is to
slide upwarcd; as, Did you call'? Is he sick"?
The downward, or falling inflection, is marked by the
grave accent, thus, (-); and indicates that the voice is to
slide downward; as, Where is London'?  Where have
you been'? Who has come'?
* Beware of running words together.
23the tvandal spirit of tinnovation and overthrow; for after
the memory of our fathers shall have been rendered contemptible, who will appreciate and sustain their institutions?
The memory of our fathers, should be the watchword of
liberty throughout the land; for, imperfect as they were, the
world before had not seen their like, nor will it soon, we
fear, behold their like again.  Such models of moral excellence, such apostles of civil and religious liberty, such shades
of the illustrious dead looking down upon their descendants with
approbation or reproof, according as they follow or depart
from the good way, constitute a +censorship inferior only to
the eye of God; and to ridicule them, is national tsuicide.
3. The doctrines of our fathers have been represented as
gloomy, +superstitious, severe, irrational, and of a licentious
tendency. But when other systems shall have produced a
piety as devoted, a morality as pure, a patriotism as disinterested, and a state of society as happy, as have prevailed
where their doctrines have been most prevalent, it may be in
season to seek an answer to this objection.
4. The persecutions instituted by our fathers, have been
the occasion of ceaseless tobloquy upon their fair fame. And
truly, it was a fault of no ordinary magnitude, that sometimes
they did persecute.  But let him whose ancestors were not
ten times more guilty, cast the first stone, and the ashes of
our fathers will no more be disturbed.  Theirs was the fault
of the age, and it will be easy to show, that no class of men
had, at that time, tapproximated so nearly to just tapprehensions of religious liberty; and that it is to them that the
world is now indebted, for the more just and definite views
which now prevail.
5. The tsuperstition and tbigotry of our fathers, are themes
on which some of their descendants, themselves far enough
from superstition, if not from bigotry, have delighted to
dwell. But when we look abroad, and behold the condition
of the world, compared with the condition of New England,
we may justly exclaim, "Would to God that the ancestors
of all the nations had been not only almost, but altogether
such bigots as our fathers were."267'
CII. - LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS.
FROM MRS. HEMANS.
1. THE breaking waves dash'd high
On a stern and rock-bound coast,
And the woods against a stormy sky
Their giant branches toss'd;
2. And the heavy night hung dark,
The hills and waters o'er,
When a band of +exiles tmoor'd their bark
On the wild New England shore.
3. Not as the conqueror comes,
They, the true-hearted, came;
Not with the roll of the stirring drums,
And the trumpet that sings of fame.
4. Not as the flying come,
In silence, and in fear;
They shook the depths of the desert's gloom
With their hymns of lofty cheer.
5. Amid the storm they sang,
And the stars heard, and the sea;
And the sounding +aisles of the dim woods rang
To the +anthem of the free.
6. The ocean eagle soar'd
From his nest by the white wave's foam,
And the rocking pines of the forest roar'd;
This was their welcome home.
7. There were men with hoary hair,
Amid that pilgrim band,
Why had they come to wither there,
Away from their childhood's land?
8. There was woman's fearless eye,
Lit by her deep love's truth;
There was manhood's brow, +serenely high,
And the fiery heart of youth.
9. What sought they thus afar?
Bright jewels of the mine?
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?
They sought a faith's pure tshrine.NEW SIXTH READER.
10. Ay, call it holy ground,
The soil where first they trod I
They have left unstain'd what there they found!
Freedom to worship God!
CIII. - THE FOURTEENTH CONGRESS.
FROM R. H. WILDE.
1. I HAD the honor to be a member of the fourteenth Congress. It was an honor then. What it is now, I shall not
say. It is what the twenty-second Congress have been
pleased to make it. I have neither time, nor strength, nor
ability, to speak of the legislators of that day, as they deserve; nor is this a fit occasion. Yet the coldest or most
careless nature, can not +recur to such associates, without
some touch of generous feeling, which, in quicker spirits,
would kindle into high and almost holy +enthusiasm.
2. tPre-eminent, among them, was a gentleman of South
Carolina,* now no more, the purest, the calmest, the most
philosophical of our country's modern statesmen: one, na
less remarkable for gentleness of manners and kindness of
heart, than for that passionless, unclouded intellect, which
rendered him deserving of the praise, if ever man deserved
it, of merely standing by, and letting reason argue for him:
the true patriot, incapable of all selfish ambition, who shunned
office and distinction, yet served his country faithfully, because he loved her: he, I mean, who +consecrated, by his
example, the noble precept; so entirely his own, that the first
station in a republic was neither to be sought after nor declined; a sentiment so just and so happily expressed, that it
continues to be repeated, because it can not be improved.
3. There was, also, a gentleman from  Marylandt, whose
ashes now slumber in your tcemetery. It is not long since I
stood by his tomb, and recalled him, as he was then, in all
the pride and power of his genius. Among the first of his
countrymen and tcotemporaries, as a +jurist and +statesman,
first as an orator, he was, if not truly eloquent, the prince of
t Pinckney.
* Lowndes.269
+rhetoricians. Nor did the soundness of his +logic suffer any
thing, by a comparison with the richness and classical purity
of the language, in which he +copiously poured forth those
figurative illustrations of his argument, which enforced while
they adorned it. But let others pronounce his +eulogy. I
must not. I feel as if his mighty spirit still haunted the
scenes of its triumphs, and when I dared to wrong them, indignantly rebuked me.
4. These names have become +historical.  There were
others, of whom it is more difficult to speak, because yet
within the reach of praise or envy. For one who was, or
aspired to be, a politician, it would be prudent, perhaps wise,
to avoid all mention of these Inen. Their acts, their words,
their thoughts, their very looks, have become subjects of
party controversy. But he whose ambition is of a higher or
lower order, has no such need of reserve. Talent is of no
party exclusively; nor is justice.
5. Among them, but not of them, in the fearful and
solitary sublimity of genius, stood a gentleman from Virginia*-whom  it were tsuperfluous to tdesignate; whose
speeches were universally read; whose +satire was universally
feared. Upon whose accents, did this habitually listless and
unlistening House, hang so frequently, with rapt attention?
Whose fame was +identified with that body for so long a
period? Who was a more +dextrous debater? a riper scholar?
better versed in the politics of our own country? or deeper
read in the history of others? Above all, who was more
thoroughly timbued with the tidiom-of the English language? more completely master of its strength, and beauty,
and delicacy? or more capable of breathing thoughts of flame,
in words of magic and tones of silver?
6. There was, also, a son of South Carolina,t still in the
service of the republic, then, undoubtedly, the most influential member of this house. With a genius eminently
tmetaphysical, he applied to politics his habits of tanalysis,
tabstraction, and tcondensation, and thus gave to the *problems of government, something of that +grandeur, which the
higher mathematics have borrowed firom astronoimy. The

wings of his mind were rapid, but capricious, and there were
times, when the light which flashed from them as they passed,
glanced like a mirror in the sun, only to dazzle the beholder.
tEngrossed with his subject, careless of his words, his loftiest
flights of eloquence were sometimes followed by tcolloquial
or tprovincial fbarbarisms. But, though often incorrect, he
was always fascinating. Language, with him, was merely the
scaffolding of thought, employed to raise a dome, which, like
Angelo's, he suspended in the heavens.
7; It is equally impossible to forget or to omit, a gentleman from Kentucky,* whom party has since made the fruitful topic of unmeasured tpanegyric and tdetraction. Of
*sanguine ttemperament, and impetuous character, his'declamation was impassioned, his retorts tacrimonious. Deficient
in trefinement, rather than in strength, his style was less
elegant and correct, than animated and impressive.  But it
swept away your feelings with it, like a mountain torrent,
and the force of the stream left you little leisure, to remark
upon its clearness. His estimate of human nature was, probably, not very high. Unhappily, it is, perhaps, more likely
to have been lowered, than raised, by his subsequent experience. Yet then and ever since, except when that imprudence so natural to genius, prevailed over his better judgment, he adopted a lofty tone of sentiment, whether he spoke
of measures or of men, of friend or adversary. On many
occasions, he was noble and captivating. One, I can never
forget. It was the fine burst of indignant eloquence, with
which he replied to the taunting question, 1" What have we
gained by the war?"
8. Nor may I pass over in silence a representative from
New Hampshire,t who has almost +obliterated all memory of
that distinction, by the superior fame he h'as attained as a
senator from Massachusetts. Though then but in the bud of
his political life, and hardly conscious, perhaps, of his own
extraordinary powers, he gave promise of the greatness he
has since +achieved. The same vigor of thought; the same
force of expression; the short sentences; the calm, cold, collected manner; the air of solemn dignity; the deep, fsepul* Clay.         t Webster.271
chral, +unimpassioned voice; all. have been developed only,
not changed, even to the intense bitterness of his tfrigid
tirony.  The piercing coldness of his +sarcasm was, indeed,
peculiar to him; it seemed to be. an +emanation from the
spirit of the icy ocean. Nothing could be at once so novel
and so powerful; it was frozen mercury, becoming as tcaustic
as red hot iron.
CIV.- THE AMERICAN FLAG.
FROM DRAKE.
1. WHEN Freedom, from her mountain hight,
tUnfurl'd her standard to the air,
She tore the tazure robe of night,
And set the stars of glory there.
She mingled with its fgorgeous dyes,
The milky tbaldrick of the skies,
And striped its pure, tcelestial white,
With streakings of the morning light;
Then, from his mansion in the sun,
She call'd her eagle-bearer down,
And gave into his mighty hand
The tsymbol of her chosen land.
2. tMajestic monarch of the cloud!
Who rear'st aloft thy +regal form,
To hear the tempest trumping loud,
And see the lightning-lances driven,
When strides the warrior of the storm,
And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven;
Child of the sun! to thee't is given
To guard the banner of the free,
To thover in the sulphur smoke,
To ward away the battle stroke,
And bid its tblendings shine afar,
Like rainbows in the cloud of war,
The +harbinger of victory.
3. Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly
The sign of hope and triumph high.
When speaks the signal-trumpet tone,
And the long line comes tgleaming on,Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet,
Has +dimm'd the glistening bayonet,
Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn
To where thy tmeteor glories burn,
And as his springing steps advance
Catch war and vengeance from the glance;
And when the cannon's tmouthings loud,
Heave, in wild wreaths, the battle tshroud,
And +gory sabers rise and fall,
Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall,
There shall thy victor glances glow,
And tcowering foes shall sink below
Each gallant arm, that strikes beneath
That awful tmessenger of death.
4. Flag of the seas! on ocean's wave
Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave.
When death, tcareering on the gale,
Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,
And frighted waves rush wildly back,
Before the broadside's reeling rack,
The dying wanderer of the sea,
Shall look at once to heaven and thee,
And smile to see thy splendors fly
In triumph o'er his closing eye.
5. Flag of the free heart's only home!
By angel hands to valor given,
Thy stars have lit the twelkin tdome,
And all thy hues were born in heaven.
Forever float that standard sheet!
Where breathes the foe but falls before us,
With Freedom's soil beneath our feet,
And Freedom's banner waving o'er us.

FROM PERCIVAL.
JAMES G. PERCIVAL, a native of Connecticut, was a poet of distinction.
He was also distinguished as a Geologist, Botanist, and Philologist.,He
was remarkable for his extreme modesty and reserve, as well as for his
learning and poetic talent. He has recently died.
1. BIRD Of the broad and sweeping wing,
Thy home is high in heaven,Where the wide storms their banners fling,
And the tempest-clouds are driven;
Thy throne is on the mountain-top;
Thy fields, the boundless air;
And hoary peaks, that proudly prop
The skies, thy dwellings are.
2. Thou art perch'd aloft, on the +beetling crag,
And the waves ape white below,
And on, with a haste that can not lag,
They rush in an endless flow;
Again thou hast plumed thy wing for flight,
To lands beyond the sea,
And away, like a spirit wreath'd in light,
Thou hurriest, wild and free.
3. Lord of the +boundless realm of air!
In thy +imperial name,'
The hearts of the bold and ardent dare
The dangerous path of fame.
Beneath the shade of thy golden wings,
The Roman +legions bore,
From the river of Egypt's cloudy springs,
Their pride to the polar shore.*
4. For thee they fought, for thee they fell,
And their oath on thee was laid;
To thee the +clarions rais'd their swell,
And the dying warrior pray'd.
Thou wert, through an age of death and fears,
The image of pride and power,
Till the gather'd rage of a thousand years,
Burst forth in one awful hour.t
5. And then, a deluge of wrath it came,
And the nations shook with dread;
And it swept the earth, till its fields were flame,
And piled with the mingled dead.
Kings were rolled in the wasteful flood,
With the low and +crouching slave;
And together lay in a shroud of blood,
The coward and the brave.
*The Roman standard was the image of an eagle. The soldiers
swore by it, and the loss of it was considered a disgrace.

"O'er the dark and +mysterious sea,
To the land that caught the setting light,

And the world in its darkness, ask'd no more
Where the glorious bird had flown.

And they breasted the unknown wave;
I saw from far the wandering crew,

CVI. - THE SHIPWRECK.
1. IN the winter of 1824, Lieutenant G, of the
United States navy, with his beautiful wife and infant child,
+embarked in a packet at Norfolk, bound to South Carolina.
For the first day and night after their departure, the wind continued fair, and the weather clear; but, on the evening of the
second day, a severe gale sprung up, and, toward midnight,
the captain, judging himself much further from the land than
he really was, and dreading the Gulf Stream, hauled in for
the coast; but with the intention, it is presumed, of lying to
when he supposed himself clear of the Gulf. Lieut. G. did
not approve of the captain's, determination, and the result
proved that his fears were well founded; for toward morning
the vessel grounded.2. Vain would it be, to attempt a description of the horror
which was +depicted in every countenance, when the awful
shock, occasioned by the striking of the vessel's bottom, was
first experienced. The terror of such a situation can be
known only to those, who have themselves been shipwrecked.
No others can have a tolerable idea of what passed in the,minds of the wretched crew, as they gazed with vacant horror
on the thundering +elements, and felt, that their frail bark
must soon, perhaps the next thump, be dashed to pieces,
and they left at the mercy of the billows, with not even
a plank between them  and teternity.  First, comes the
thumping of the vessel; next the dashing of the surge over
her sides; then, the +careening of the vessel on her beam
ends, as the waves, for an instant, +recede; and lastly, the
crashing of the spars and timbers, at each returning wave;
the whole forming a scene of confusion and horror which no
language can describe.
3. B3ut %l as is the shipwrecked sailor's prospect, what
are his feeigs compared to the agony of a fond husband and
father, who clasps in a last embrace his little world, his beloved wife and child! The land was in sight, but to approach
it was scarcely less dangerous, than to reimain in the raging
sea around them.. Lieut. G. w#s a seaman, and a brave one;

The freight was already too much. Mr. G. saw this, and

CVII. - TO MY MOTHER.
1. I know thou art gone to the land of thy rest;
Then why should my soul be so sad?
I know thou art gone where the weary are blest,
And the mourner loots up and is glad;
Where Love has put off in the land of its birth,
The stain it had gather'd in this,
And Hope, the sweet singer that gladden'd the earth,
Lies asleep in the bosom of bliss.
2. I know thou art gone where thy forehead is starr'd
With the beauty that dwelt in thy soul,
Where the light of thy loveliness can not be tmarr'd,
Nor thy heart be flung back from its tgoal;
I know thou hast drunk of the Lethe that flows
Through a land where they do not forget;
That sheds over memory only trepose,
And takes from it only regret.
3. This eye must be dark that so long has been dim,
Ere again it may gaze upon thine;
But my heart has trevealings of thee and thy home,
In many a token and sign;I never look up with a vow, to the sky,
But a light like thy beauty is there;
And I hear a low murmur, like thine, in reply,
When I pour out my spirit in prayer.
4. In the far-away dwelling, wherever it be,
I believe thou hast +visions of mine;
And the love that made all things as music to me,
I have not yet learn'd to resign.
In the +hush of the night, on the waste of the sea,
Or alone with the breeze, on the hill,
I have ever a presence that whispers of thee,
And my spirit lies down and is still.
5. And though like a mourner that sits by a tomb,
I am wrapp'd in a tmantle of care;
Yet the grief of my bosom-oh! call it not gloomIs not the black grief of despair.
By sorrow +reveal'd, as the stars are by night,
Far off a bright vision appears;
And hope, like the rainbow-a creature of light,
Is born, like the rainbow, in tears.
CVIII.- THE 3AGLE'S NEST.
FROM WILSON.
BAIRN; Child.   WEE WEAN; a little child.
1. ALMOST all the people in the parish were loading in
their meadow-hay on the same day of midsummer, so drying
was the sunshine and the wind; and huge heaped-up +wains,
that almost hid from view the horses that drew them along
the sward beginning to get green with second growth,
were moving in all directions toward the snug farm-yards.
Never had the parish seemed before so populous. tJocund
was the balmy air with laughter, whistle, and song. But the
+tree-gnomons threw the shadow of "one o'clock" on the
green dial-face of the earth; the horses were unyoked and
took instantly p grazing; groups of men, women, lads, lasses,
and children, collected under grove, and bush, and hedgerow;
graces were pronounced, some of them rather too tedious in
presence of the tmantling milk-cans, bullion-bars of butter,NEW SIXTH READER.
and crackling cakes; and the great Being who gave them
that day their daily bread, looked down from his eternal
throne, well-pleased with the piety of his thankful creatures.
2. The great golden eagle, the pride and the pest of the
parish, stooped d.own, and flew away with something in its
-talons.  One single sudden, female shriek arose; and, then,
shouts and outcries, as if a church spire had tumbled down
on a congregation at a tsacrament:' Hannah Lamond's
bairn! Hannah Lamond's bairn!" was the loud, fast-spreading cry. "The eagle has ta'en off Hannah Lamond's bairn! "
and many hundred feet were, in another instant hurrying
toward the mountain.  Two miles of hill and tdale, and
tcopse, and shingle, and many +intersecting brooks lay between; but, in an incredibly short time, the foot of the
mountain was alive -with people.
3. The taerie was well known, and both old birds were
visible on the rock-ledge. But who shall scale that dizzy
cliff, which Mark Steuart, the sailor, who had been at the
storming of many a fort, attempted in vain? All kept gazing,
weeping, wringing their hands in vain, rooted to the ground,
or running back and forward, like so many ants +essaying
their new wings in tdiscomfiture. "What's the use, what's
the use o' ony puir human means? We have no power but
in prayer!" and many kn#et down-fathers and mothers
hAinking of their own babies-as if they would force the deaf
heavens to hear!
4. Hannah Lamond had all this while been sitting on a
rock, with a face perfectly white, and eyes like those of a
mad person, fixed on the aerie. Nobody had noticed her;
for strong at all sympathies with her had been at the swoop
of the eagle, they were now swallowed up in the agony of
eyesight.  "Only last sabbath was mly sweet' wee wean
baptized in the name o' the Father, and the Son, and the
lholy Ghost!" and on uttering these words, she flew off
through the brakes and over the huge stones, up-up-up--
faster than ever huntsman ran in to the death, fearless as a
goat playing among the precipices.
5. No one doubted, no one could doubt, that she would
soon be dashed to pieceq. But have not people who walk in
their sleep, obedient to the mysterious guidance of dreams;climbed the walls of old ruins, and found footing, even in
+decrepitude, along the edge of unguarded +battlements, and
down +dilapidated staircases, deep as draw-wells or coal-pits,
and returned with open, fixed, and unseeing eyes, unharmad
to their beds, at midnight!  It is all the work of the soul,
to whom the body is a slave; and shall not the agony of a
mother's passion, who sees her baby whose warm mouth had
just left her breast. hurried off by a demon to a hideous
death, bear her limbs aloft wherever there is dust to dust, till
she reach that devouring den, and fiercer and more furious
far, in the passion of love, than any bird of prey that ever
bathed its beak in blood, throttle the fiends, that with their
heavy wings would fain flap her down the cliffs, and hold up
her child in deliverance before the eye of the all-seeing God?
6. No stop-no stay,-she knew not -that she drew her
breath. Beneath her feet, providence fastened every loose
stone, and to her hands strengthened every root. How was
she ever to descend? That fear but once crossed her heart,
as she went up--up-up-to the little image of her own flesh
and blood.  " The God who holds me now from perishing,
will not the same God save me when my child is on my
bosom?"  Down came the fierce rushing of the eagles'
wings; each savage bird dashing close to her head, so that
she saw the yellow of their wraehful eyes. All at once, they
tquailed and were cowed. Yelling, they flew off to the
stump of an ash, tjutting out of a cliff, a thousand feet above
the cataract; and the Christian mother falling across the
aerie, in the midst of bones and blood, clasped her childdead--dead-dead-no doubt-but unmangled and untorn,
and +swaddled up just as it was, when slhe laid it dawn asleep
among the fresh hay in a nook of the harvest field.
7. Oh i! what a pang of perfect blessedness +transfixed her
heart from that faint, feeble cry,-"'It lives-it lives-it
lives!" and baring her bosom, with loud laughter and eyes
dry as stones, she felt the lips of the +unconscious innocent,
once more murmuring at the fount of life and love!'"O
thou great and thou dreadful God! wihither hast thou brought
me, one of the most sinful of thy creatures? Oh! save my
soul, lest it perish, even for thy own name's sake!. Oh thou,
who diedst to save sinners, have mercy upon me!"NEW SIXTH READER.
8. Below, were cliffs, +chasms, blocks of stone, and the
+skeletons of old trees-far-far down-and +dwindled into
specks, and a thousand creatures of her own kind, tstationary,
or running to and fro! Was that the sound of the waterfall, or the faint roar of voices? Is that her native strath?
and that tuft of trees, does it contain the hut, in which
stands the cradle of her child? Never more shall it be
rocked by her foot!  Here must she die; and, when her
breast is exhausted, her baby too! And those horrid beaks,
and eyes, and talons, and wings, will return, and her child
will be devoured at last, even within the dead bosom, that can
protect it no more.
CIX. - THE EAGLE'S NEST.- CONCLUDED.
SCREES; precipices. MAUN; must. CLAES; clothes.
1. WHERE, all this time, was Mark Steuart, the sailor?
Half way up the cliffs. But his eye had got dim, and his
heart sick; and he, who had so often reefed the top-gallant
sail, when, at midnight, the coming of the gale was heard
afar, covered his face with his hands, and dared look no longer on the swinmming hights.  "And who will take care of my
poor, bed-ridden mother?" thought Hannah, whose soul,
through the +exhaustion  of so many passions, could no
more retain in its grasp that hope, which it had +clutched in
despair. A voice whispered "God."  She looked around,
expecting to see an angel, but nothing moved, except a rotten
branch, that, under its own weight, broke off from the crumbling rock. Her eye, by some secret +sympathy of her soul
with the inanimate object, watched its fall; and it seemed to
stop not far off, on a small +platform.
2. Her child was bound within her bosom -she remembered not how or when, - but it was safe--and, scarcely daring to open her eyes, she slid down the shelving rocks, and
found herself on a small piece of firm, root-bound soil, with
the tops of bushes appearing below. With fingers suddenly
strengthened into the power of iron, she swung herself down,
by briar, and broom, and +heather, and dwarf-birch.  Here,
a loosened stone leaped over a ledge, and no sound was heard,so profound was its fall: There, the shingle rattled down the
screes, and she hesitated not to follow. Her feet bounded
against the huge stone that stopped them, but she felt no
pain. Her body was tcallous as the cliff. Steep, as the upright wall of a house, was now the side of the precipice.
But it was +matted with ivy, +centuries old, long ago dead,
and without a single green leaf, but with thousands of armthick stems, +petrified into the rock, and covering it, as with
a ttrellis. She bound her baby to her neck, and, with hands
and feet, clung to the fearful ladder.
3. Turning round her head and looking down, lo! the
whole population of the parish--so great was the multitude
-on their knees! and, hush! the voice of psalms! a hymn,
breathing the spirit of one united prayer! Sad and solemn
was the strain, but nothing dirge-like, breathing not of death,
but deliverance. Often had she sung that tune, perhaps the
very words,-but them she heard not -in her own hut, she
and her mother; or, in the kirk, along with the congregation.
An unseen hand seemed fastening her fingers to the ribs
of ivy, and, in sudden tinspiration, believing that her
life- was to be saved, she became almost as fearless as if
she had been changed into a winged creature. Again her
feet touched stones and earth, the psalm was hushed, but a
ttremulous, sobbing voice was close beside her, and lo! a shegoat, with two little kids, at her feet!  "Wild hights,"
thought she,' "do these creatures climb, but the dam will lead
down her kid by the easiest paths; for, oh! even in the brute
creatures, what is the holy power of a mother's love! ".nd,
turning round her head, she kissed her sleeping baby, and,
for the first time, she wept.
4. Overhead, frowned the front of the precipice, never
before touched by human hand or foot. No one had ever
dreamed of +scaling it, and the golden eagles knew that well
in their instinct, as, before they built their aerie, they had
brushed it with their wings. But all the rest of this part
of the mountain-side, though'scarred, and +seamed, and
+chasmed, was yet taccessible; and more than one person in
the parish had reached the bottom  of the Glead's Cliff.
Many were now attempting it; and, ere the'cautious mother
had followed her dumb guides a hundred yards, though among
24NEW SIXTH READER.
dangers, that, although enough to terrify the stoutest heart,
were ttraversed by her without a shudder, the head of one
man appeared, and then the head of another; and she knew
that God had delivered her and her child, in safety, into the
care of their fellow creatures.
5. Not a word was spoken, eyes said enough, she hushed
her friends with her hands, and, with uplifted eyes, pointed
to the guides lent to her by Heaven.+ Small, green +plats,
where those creatures nibble the wild flowers, became
now more frequent; trodden lines, almost as easy as sheeppaths, showed that the dam had not led her young into
danger; and now, the brush-wood dwindled away into straggling shrubs, and the party stood on a little +eminence above
the stream, and forming part of the strath.
6. There had been trouble and agitation, much sobbing,
and many tears, among the multitude, while the mother was
scaling the cliffs; sublime was the shout that echoed afar, the
moment she reached the +aerie; then, had succeeded a
silence, deep as death; in a little while, arose that hymning
prayer, succeeded by mute supplication; the wildness of
thankful and teongratulatory joy, had next its sway;  
now, that her salvation was sure, the great crowd rustl  ke
a wind-swept wood. And for whose sake was all tlternation of +agony?  A poor, humble creature, un rnown to
many, even by name; one who had but few friends, nor
wished for more; contented to work all day, here, there, any
where, that she might be able t0o support her aged mother,
and her little child; and who, on sabbath, took her seat in
an obscure pew, set apart for tpaupers, in the kirk!
7. "Fall back, and give her fresh air," said the old minister
of the parish; and the circle of close faces widened around
her, lying as in death.  "Give me the boniie bit bairn into
my arms," cried first one mother, and then another; and it
was tenderly handed around the circle of kisses, many of the
snooded maidens bathing its face in tears. "There's na a
scratch about the puir innocent, for the eagle you see maun
hae stuck its ttalons into the lang claes, and the shawl.
Blin', blin,' maun they be, who see not the finger o' God in
this thing!"
8 Hannah started up from her tswoon, and, looking283
wildly around, cried, "Oh! the bird! the bird! the eagle!
the eagle has carried off my bonnie wee Walter! is there
nane to pursue?"  A neighbor put her baby to her breast,
and, shutting her eyes, and smiting her forehead, the sorely
-bewildered creature said, in a low voice, " Am  I wauken'
oh! tell me if I'am  wauken? or if a' this be the wark o'
a fever, and the delirium o' a dream?"

And drive thee from thy elevation proud,
Down whirling, lifeless, to the dim-seen plain?

Lifeless thou iiest, outstretch'd beside the desert stone.

High on the herbless rock, thou'wok'st to birth,

Even like a courier, sent from earth to hold
With tspace-dissever'd worlds, unaw'd, communion bold.

warred; the echoing twhoop, the bloody tgrapple, the defying

here, curled the smoke of peace.
2. Here, too, they worshiped; and from many a dark
bosom went up a fervent prayer to the Great Spirit. He had
not written his laws for them on tables of stone, but he had
traced them on the tables of their hearts. The poor child of
Nature knew not the God of Revelation, but the God of the
tuniverse he acknowledged in every thing around. He beheld
him in the star that sank in beauty behind his lonely dwelling;
in the sacred orb that flamed on him from his mid-day throne;
in the flower that snapped in the morning breeze; in the lofty
pine that defied a thousand whirl-winds; in the timid +warbler
that never left its native grove; in the fearless eagle, whose
untired tpinion was wet in clouds; in the worm that crawled
at his feet; and in his own +matchless form, glowing with a
spark of that light, to whose mysterious source he bent in
humble, though blind adoration.

CXIII.- THE TWINS.
FROM WILSON.
MANSE; a clergyman's house.
1. THE Kirk of Auchindown stands, with its burialground, on a little, green hill, surrounded by an irregular and
straggling village, or rather about a hundred +hamlets clustering round it, with their fields and gardens. A few of
these gardens come close up to the church-yard wall, and, in
spring time, many of the fruit trees hang, rich and beautiful,
over the +adjacent graves. The voices and the laughter of
the children at play on the green before the parish school, or
their composed murmur, when at their various lessons together in the room, may be distinctly heard all over the
burial-ground. So may the song of the maidens going to
the well; while all around, the singing of birds is thick and
hurried; and a small rivulet, as if brought there to be aneiemblem of passing time, glides away beneath the mossy
wall, +murmuring continually a dream-like tune round the
dwellings of the dead.
2. In the quiet of the evening, my venerable friend took
me with him  into the church-yard.  We walked to the
eastern corner, where, as we approached, I saw a monument
standing almost by itself, and, even at that distance, appearing to be of a somewhat different character from any other
in the burial-ground. And now we stood close to, and before it. It was a low +mIonument of the purest white marble;
simple, but perfectly elegant and graceful withal, and upon
its unadorned slab, lay the +sculptured images of two children
asleep in each other's arms.
3. Around it, was a small piece of the greenest ground,
without the protection of any rail, but obviously belonging
-to the monument. It shone, without offending them, among
simpler or ruder burial-beds round about it; and, although
the costliness of the materials, the affecting beauty of the
design, and the delicacy of its execution, all showed that
there slept the offspring neither of the poor nor low in life,
yet so meekly and sadly did it lift up its unstained little
Walls, and so well did its unusual elegance meet and blend
with the character of the common tombs, that no heart could
see it without sympathy, and without owning, that it was a
pathetic ornament of a place, filled with the ruder +memorials'
of the very humblest dead.
4. "Six years ago," said my +venerable companion, "I
was an old man, and wished to have silence and stillness in
my house, that my communion with Him before whom I expected every day to be called, might be undisturbed. Accordingly, my Manse, that used to ring with boyish +glee, was now.
quiet; when, a lady, elegant, graceful, beautiful, young, and
a widOW, came to my dwelling, and  her soft, sweet, silver
voice, told me that she was' from  England. She was' the
+relict of an officer slain in war; and having heard one who
had lived in my house, speak of his happy and innocent time
there, she earnestly requested; me to receive beneath my roof,
her two sons. She, herself, lived with the bed-ridden mother
of her deadliusband; and anxious for the growing minds:of
her b6ys,' sh si ought to commit them, for a shdrt t1i, -toe" my:

care. They and their mother soon won an old man's heart;
and I could say nothing in +opposition to her request, but
that I was upward of three score and ten years old. But I am
living still; and that is their monument."
5. We sat down at these words, on the sloping head-stone
of the grave, just opposite to this little, beautiful tstructure;
arnd without entreaty, and as if to bring back upon his heart
the delight of old, tender remembrances, the venerable man
thus continued.
6. "The lady left them with me in the Manse; surely
the two most beautiful and engaging creatures that ever died
in youth. They were twins. Like were they unto each
other, as two bright-plumaged doves of one color, or two
flowers with the same blossom and the same leaves. They
were dressed alike, and whatever they wore, in that did they
seem more especially beautiful. Their hair was the same, a
bright auburn; their voices were as one; so that the twins
were tinseparable in my love, whether I beheld them, or my
dim eyes were closed.
7. "From the first hour they were left alone with me, and
without their mother in the Manse, did I begin to love them;
nor were they slow in returning an old man's affection. They
stole up to my side, and submitted their smooth, tglossy,
leaning heads to my withered and trembling hand; nor, for
awhile, could I tell, as the sweet beings came gliding tgladsomely near me, which was Edward and which was Henry;
and often did they, in winning playfulness, try to deceive my
loving heart. But they could not defraud each other of their
tenderness; for whatever the one received, that was ready to
be tbestowed upon the other. To love the one more than the
other was impossible.
8. " Sweet creatures I It was not long before I learned to
distinguish them. That which seemed to me, at first, so perfectly the same, soon unfolded itself with many delightful
+varieties, and then I wondered how I evei could have mistaken them for one another. Different shadows played upon
their hair; that of the one being silky and srlooth, and of the
other, slightly curled at the edges, and tclustering thickly,
when he flung back his locks in playfulness or joy. His
eyes, though of a hazel hue, like those of his brother, were291
considerably lighter, and a smile seemed native there; while
those of the other seemed almost dark, and fitter for the mist
of tears. Dimples marked the cheeks of the one, but those of
the other were paler and smooth.
9. " Their voices too, when I listened to them, and knew
their character, had a faint, tfluctuating difference of inflection
and tone, like the same instrument blown upon with a somewhat stronger or weaker breath. Their very laugh grew to be
different to my ear; that of the one, free and more frequent,
that of the other, mild in its utmost glee. And they had not
been many days in the Manse, before I knew in a moment,
dim as my eyes had long been, the soft, timid, stealing step
of Edward, from the dancing and fearless motion of Henry
Howard."
10. Here the old man paused, not as it seemed from any
fatigue in speaking so long, but as if to indulge more profoundly in his remembrance of the children whom he had so
tenderly loved. He fixed his dim eyes on their tsculptured
images, with as fond an expression as if they had been alivel
and had lain down there to sleep; and when, without looking
on me, whom he felt to have been listening with a quiet attention, he again began to speak, it was partly to tell the tale
of these fair sleepers, and partly to give vent to his loving grief.
11. "All strangers, even many who thought they knew
them well, were pleasantly perplexed with the faces and figures
of the bright English twins. The poor beggars, as they went
their rounds, blessed them, without knowing whether it was
Edward or Henry, that had bestowed his alms. Even the
mother of the cottage children with whom they played, confused their images in her affectionate heart, as she named
them in her prayers. When only one was present, it gave
a start of strange delight to them who did not know the
twins, to see another creature, so beautifully the same, come
gliding in upon them, and join his brother in a share of their
suddenly bestowed affection.
12. " They soon came to love, with all their hearts, the
place of their new habitation. Not even in their own merry
England, had their young eyes ever seen brighter green fields;
trees more tumbrageous; or, perhaps, even +rural gardens
more flowery and blossoming, than those of tbis Scottishvillage. They had lived, indeed, mostly in a town; and in the
midst of the freshness and tbalminess of the country, they
became,4ba.ppier and more +gleesome; it was said, by many,
even more -beautiful. The affectionate creatures did not forget
their mo.eg? +Alternately did they write to her every week,
and every week did one or other receive from her a letter,
in which the sweetest maternal feelings were traced, in small,
delicate lines, that bespoke the hand, of an accomplished lady.
13. " Their education had not been neglected; and they
learned every thing they were taught with a surprising quickness and docility. Morning and evening too, did they kneel
down with, clasped: hands-these lovely twins--even at my
feet, and resting on my knees; and tmelodiously did they
murmur together the hymns which their mother had taught
them, and passages selected, from the scriptures. And always,
the last thing they did before going: to sleep in each other's
arms, was to look at their mother's- picture, and to kiss it with
fond kisses, and many an endearing name."
14. Just then two birds alighted softly on the white marble
monument, and begani to trim  their plumes. They were
doves, from their nests in: the +belfry of the tspire, from which
a low, deep, Iplaintive murmuring was now heard to come,
deepening the profound silence of the burying-ground. The
two bright birds walked about for a few minutes, around the
image of the children, or stood quietly at their feet; and then,
clapping their wings- flew up and disappeared. The incident,
though at any other time, common and uninteresting, had a
strange effect upon my heart, and seemed dimly temblematic
of the innocence and beauty of the inhabitants of the tomb,
and of the flight of their: innocent souls to heaven.
CXIV. T- THE TWIINS:-- CONCLUDED.
1. "ONE evening in early autumn, (thley had been with
me from the middle of May,) Edward, the elder, complained,
on going to bed, of a, sore throat, and r proposed that his
brother- sh-ould sleep in another bed:. I saw them myself,
accordingly, in separate. places of repose.  But on going;
about an hour afterward into their room, there I found them,293
locked, as usual, in each other's arms, face to face; and their
innocent breath mingling from lips that nearly touched. I
could not find heart to separate them; nor could I have done
so without awaking Edward.  His cheeks were red and
flushed, and his sleep broken and full of starts.
2. "Early in the morning, I went.to their bed-side. Henry
was lying apart from his brother, looking at him with a tearful face, and his little arm laid so as to touch his bosom.
Edward was unable to rise. His throat was painful, his pulse
high, and his heart sick. Before evening he became slightly
tdelirious, and his illness was evidently a fever of a dangerous and tmalignant kind. He was, as I told you, a bold and
gladsome child; when not at his task, dancing and singing
almost every hour; but the fever quickly tsubdued his spirit;
the tshivering fits made him  weep and wail; and trueful
indeed was the change which a single night and day had
brought forth.
3. "His brother seemed to be afraid more than children
usually are of sickness, which they are always slow to link
with the thoughts of death. But he told me, weeping, that
his eldest brother had died of a fever, and that his mother
was always alarmed about that disease.'Did I think,' asked
he, with wild eyes and a fpalpitating heart,'did I think that
Edward was going to die?'  I looked at the affectionate
child, and taking him to my bosom, I felt that his own blood
was beating but too quickly, and, that fatal had been that
night's sleeping embrace in his brother's bosom. The fever
had tainted his sweet veins also, and I had soon to lay him
shivering on his bed. In another day, he too was delirious,
and too plainly chasing his brother into the grave.
4. " Never in the purest hours of their healthful happiness,
had their innocent natures seemed to me more beautiful, than
now, in their delirium. As it increased, all tvagu&amp; fears of
dying left their souls, and they kept talking as if to each
other, of every thing here or in England, that was pleasant
and interesting. Now and then, they murmured the names
of persons of whom I had not formerly heard them speak;
friends who had been kind to them before I had known of
their existence, and servants in their mother's or their father's thousehold, Of their mother they spoke to the ald~NEW SIXTH- READER.
although necessarily kept apart, almost in the very same
words, expecting a visit from her at the fManse, and then
putting out their little hands to embrace her. All their little, innocent plays were acted over and over again, on the
bed of death. They were looking into the nests of the little
singing-birds, which they never injured, in the hedge-rows,
and the woods. And the last intelligible words that I heard
Edward utter were these -'Let us go, brother, to the
church-yard, and lie down on the daisies, among the little,
green mounds!'
5.'" They died within an hour of each other. I lifted up
Henry, when I saw he too was dead, and laid him down
beside his brother.  There lay the twins, and had their
mother at that hour come into the room, she would have been
thankful to see that sight, for she would have thought that
her children were in a calm and refreshing sleep!"
6. My eyes were fixed upon the sculptured images of the
dead, lying side by side, with their faces turned to heaven;
their little hands folded, as in prayer, upon their bosoms, and
their eyelids closed. The old man drew a sigh, almost like
a sob, and wept. They had been tentrusted to his care; they
had come smilingly from another land; for one summer they
were happy, and then disappeared, like fading flowers, from
the earth. I wished that the old man would cease his touching narrative, both for his sake and my own. So I rose, and
walked up quite close to the monument, inspecting the spirit
of its design, and marking the finish of its execution. But
he called me to him, and requesting me to resume my seat
beside him on the grave-stone, he thus continued:
7. " I had written to their mother in England, that the
children were in extreme danger; but it was not possible
that,she could arrive in time to see them  die; not even to
see them sburied. Decay was fast preying upon them, and
the beauty of death was beginning to disappear; so we could
not wait the arrival, of their mother, and their grave was
made. Even the old, gray-headed sexton wept; for in this
case of +mortality, there was something to break in upon the
ordinary ttenor of his thoughts, and to stir up in his heart,
feelings that he could not have known existed there. There
was sadness, indeed, over all the parish for the fair English295
twins, who had come to live in the Manse after all the other
boys had left it: and who, as they were the last, so were they
the loveliest of all my flock. The very sound, or +accent of
their southern voices, so pretty and engaging to our ears, in
the simplicity of childhood, had won many a heart, and
touched, too, the imaginations of many with a new delight;
and, therefore, on the morning when they were buried, it
may be said there was here a fast day of grief.
8. "The next day their mother arrived  at the Manse.
She knew, before she came, that her children were dead and
buried. It is true that she wept, and at the sight of the
grave,-for they both lay in one coffin,-her grief was passionate and bitter, But that fit soon passed away. Her tears
were tears of pity for them, but, as for herself, she hoped
that she was soon to see them in heaven. Her face pale, yet
flushed; her eyes hollow, yet bright; and general languor
and tlassitude over her whole frame, all told that she was in
the first stage of a consumption. Soon, other duties called
her back to England, for the short remainder of her life.
She herself drew the design of that monument with her own
hand, and left it with me when she went away. I soon heard
of her death.  Her husband lies near Grenada, in Spain;
she lies in the +chancel of the +cathedral of Salisbury, in
England; and there, sleep her twins, in the little burialground of Auchindown, a Scottish parish."

CXVI. - AN EVENING ADVENTURE.
1. NOT long since, a gentleman was traveling in one of the
Counties of Virginia, and about the close of the day stopped
at a public house to obtain refreshment and spend the night.
He had been there but a short time, before an old man
alighted from his gig, with the +apparent intention of becoming his fellow guest at the same house.
2. As the old man drove up, he observed that both the297
shafts of his gig were broken, and that they were held together by withes, formed from the bark of a hickory sapling. Our traveler observed farther, that he was plainly clad,'that his knee buckles were loosened, and that something like
negligence tpervaded his dress. Conceiving him to be one
of the honest tyeomanry of our land, the +courtesies of
strangers passed between them, and they entered the tayern.
It was about the same time, that an addition of three or four
young gentlemen, was-made to their number; most, if not
all of them, of the legal professipn.
3. As soon as they became cnvenpieptly +accol mmodated,
the conversation was turned, by one of the latter, upon the
eloquent harangue which had that day been displayed at
the bar. It was replied by the other, that he had witnessed,
the same day, a degree of eloquence, no doubt equal, but it
was from the pulpit. Something like'a tsarcastic +rejoinder
was made as to the eloquence of the pulpit, and a warm
and able taltercation ensued, in which the merits of the
Christian religion became the subject of fdiscussion. From
six o'clock until eleven, the young champions wielded the
sword of argument, adducing with ingenuity and ability every
thing that could be said pro and con.
4. During this protracted period, the old gentleman listened
with the meekness and modesty of a child, as if he were
adding new information to the stores of his own mind; or
perhaps he was observing with a tphilosophic eye, the tfaculties of the youthful mind, and how new tenergies are +evolved
by repeated action; or perhaps, with patriotic emotion, he
was reflecting upon the future destinies of his country, and
on the rising generation, upon whom those future destinies
must tdevolve; or, most probably, with a sentiment of moral
and religious feeling, he was collecting an targument which
no art would be "able to elude, and no force to resist."
Our traveler remained a spectator, and took no part in what
was said.
5. At last, one af the. young men, remarking that it was
impossible to combat with long and established'+prejuidices,
wheeled around, and with some familiarity, exclaimed,
"Well, my old gentleman, what think you of these things?"
f,; said the traveler, a streak of vivid lightning had at thatNEW SIXTH READER.
moment crossed the room, their amazement could not have
been greater than it was from what followed. The most eloquent and unanswerable appeal that he had ever heard or read
was made for nearly an hour, by the old gentleman. So perfect
was his recollection, that every argument urged against the
Christian religion, was met in the order in which it was advanced. Hume's +sophistry on the subject of miracles, was,
if possible, more perfectly answered, than it had already
been done by Campbell. And in the whole lecture there was
so much simplicity and energry, +pathos and sublimity, that
not another word was uttered.
6. An attempt to describe it, said the traveler, would be
an attempt to paint the sunbeams. It was now a matter of
curiosity and inquiry, who the old gentleman was. The
traveler concluded that it was the preacher from whom the
pulpit eloquence was heard; but no; it was JOHN MARSHAL,
the CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES.
CXVII. - NEW YEAR'S NIGHT OF AN UNHAPPY MAN.
FROM THE GERMAN OF RICHTER.
1. ON new-year's night, an old man stood at his window,
and looked, with a glance of fearful despair, up to the immovable, unfading heaven, and down upon the still, pure,
white earth, on which no one was no now so joyless and
sleepless as he. His grave stood near him; it was covered
only with the snows of age, not with the verdure of youth;
and he brought with him out of a whole, rich life, nothing but
errors, sins, and diseases; a wasted body; a desolate soul; a
heart, full of poison; and an old age, full of repentance.
2. The happy days of his early youth passed before him,
like a tprocession of +specters, and brought back to him
that lovely morning, when his father first placed him on the
cross-way of life, where the right hand led by the sunny
paths of virtue, into a large and quiet laAd, full of light and
harvests; and the left plunged by the tsubterranean walks of
vice, into a black cave, full of tdistilling poison, of hissing
snakes, and of dark, sultry vapors.
3. Alas, the snakes were hanging upon his breast, and299
the drops of poison on his tongue; and he now, at length,
felt all the horror of his situation.  +Distracted, with unspeakable grief, and with face up-turned to heaven, he cried,
"My father! give me back my youth! 0, place me once
again upon life's cross-way, that I may choose aright." But
his father and his youth were long since gone.  He saw
+phantom-lights dancing upon the marshes, and disappearing at the church-yard; and he said, 1" These are my foolish
days!"  He saw a star shoot from heaven, and +glittering in
its fall, vanish upon the earth. "Behold an +emblem of my
career," said his bleeding heart, and the serpent tooth of
repentance digged deeper into his wounds.
4. His excited +imagination showed him specters flying upon
the roof, and a skull, which had been left in the *charnelhouse, gradually assumed his own features. In the midst of
this confusion of objects, the music of the new-year flowed
down from the steeple, like distant +church-melodies. His
heart began to melt. He looked around the horizon, and
over the wide earth, and thought of the friends of his youth,
who now, better and happier than he, were the wise of the
earth, prosperous men, and the fathers of happy children;
and he said, "Like you, I also might slumber, with tearless
eyes, through the long nights, had I chosen aright in the
outset of my career. Ah, my father! had I hearkened to
thy instructions, I too might have been happy."
5. In this feverish remembrance of his youthful days, a
skull bearing his features, seemed slowly to rise from the
door of the tcharnel-house. At length, by that +superstition,
which, in the new-year's night, sees the shadow of the future,
it became a living youth.  He could look no longer; he
covered his eyes; a thousand burning tears streamed down,
and fell upon the snow. In accents scarcely audible, he
sighed +disconsolately: "Oh, days of my youth, return, return 1" And they did return. It had only been a horrible
dream. But, although he was still a youth, his errors had
been a reality. And he thanked God, that he, still young,
was able to pause in the degrading course of vice, and return
to the sunny path which leads to the land of harvests.
6. Return with him, young reader, if thou art walking in
the same downward path, lest his dream become thy reality.For if thou turnest not now, in the spring-time of thy days,
vainly, in after years, when the shadows,of age are darkening around thee, shalt thou call, "Return, oh beautiful days
of youth!"  Those beautiful days, gone, gone forever, and
hidden in the Shadows of the misty past, shall close their
ears against thy miserable cries, or answer thee in hollow
accents, "Alqs! we return no wre.'
CXVIII. - THE CLOSING YEAR.
FROM PRENTICE.
1.'T Is midnight's holy hour, and silence now
Is brooding, like a gentle spirit, o'er
The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds,
The bell's deep tones are swelling;'t is the knell
Of the departed year. No fuineral train
Is sweeping past; yet, on the stream and wood,
With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest
Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirr'd,
As by a mourner's sigh; and, on yon cloud,
That floats so still and placidly through heaven,
The spirits of the Seasons seem to stand,
Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form,
And Winter, with his aged locks,-and breathe
In mournful +cadences, that come abroad
Like the far wind-ha?'s wild and touching +wail,
A melancholy +dirge o'er the dead year,
Gone from the earth forever.
2.'Tis a  time
For memory and for tears. Within the deep,
Still chambers of the heart, a tspecter dim,
Whose tones are like the +wizard voice of Time,
Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold
And solemn finger to the beautiful
And holy visions, that have pass'd away,
-And left no shadow of their loveliness
On the dead waste of life. The +specter lifts
The coffin-lid of Hope, and Joy, and Love,
And bending mournfully above the pale,
Sweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead.fqwers,
O'er what has pass'd to nothingness.3.          The year
IHas gone, and with it, many a glorious throng
Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,
Its shadow, in each heart. In its swift course,
It waved its scepter o'er the beautiful,
And they are not. It laid its tpallid hand
Upon the strong man: and the haughty form
Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.
It trod the hall of +revelry, where thronged
The bright and joyous'; and the tearful wail
Of stricken ones is heard, -Where erst the song
And treckless shou;t +resoundedi. It pass'd o'er
The battle-plain, where sword, and spear, and shield,
Flash'd in the light of mid-day; and the strength
Of +serried hosts is shiver'd, and the grass,
Green from the soil of tcarnage, waves above
The crush'd and'+moldering tskeleton. It came,
And faded like a wreath of mist at eve;
Yet, ere it melted in the tviewless air,
It +heralded its millions to their home,
In the dim land -of dreams.
4.          tRemorseles-s Time!
Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe! What power
Can stay him in his silent course, or melt
His iron heart to pity'!.Oi, still: on,
He presses, and forever. The proud bird,
The +condor of the, Andes, that can soar
Through heaven's turifathormable depths, or brave
The fury of the nortlierl hurricane,
And bathe his plumage in the thunder's home,
Furls his broad'wing at night-fall, and sinks down
To rest upon his miountain crag; but Time
Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness;
And Nigh'ts deep, darkness has no chain to bind
IIis rushing pinion.
5.          +Revolutiosi sweep
O'eir earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast
Of dreaming sdrrow; citieg rise and sink
Like bubbles on the water; fiery isles
Spring blazing froni the ocean, and go back
To their +mysterious caverhns; mouritains rear
To heaven their bold and blacken'd cliffs, and bow
Their tall heads to the pliin; and: empires-rise,
Gathering the strength of hoary centuries,And rush down, like the Alpine +avalanche,
Startling the nations; and the very stars,
Yon bright and glorious +blazonry of God,
Glitter awhile in their eternal depths,
And, like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,
Shoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away
To darkle in the trackless void; yet Time,
Time, the tomWbbuilder, holds his fierce career,
Dark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not
Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,
To sit and muse, like other conquerors,
Upon that fearful ruin he hath wrought.
CXIX.- THE PASSIONS.
FROH COLLINS.
1.  WHEN Music, heavenly maid! was young,
While yet, in early Greece, she iung,
The +Passions, oft, to hear her shell,
+Throng'd around her magic cell; 5
tExulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possess'd beyond the muse's painting:
By turns, they felt the +glowing mind
Disturb'd, delighted, rais'd, +refined;
Till once,'t is said, when all were fired,
Fill'd with fury, rapt, inspired,
From the supporting fmyrtles round,
They snatch'd her instruments of sound;
And, as they oft had heard apart,
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,
Each, (for madness ruled the hour,)
Would prove his own +expressive power.
2. First Fear, his hand, its skill to try,
Amid the chords +bewitler'd laid;
And back recoil'd, he knew not why,
E'en at the sound himself had made.
3. Next Anger rush'd, his eyes on fire
In lightnings own'd his secret stings;
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept with hurried hand, the strings.4. With +woeful measures, wan Despair
Low sullen sounds his grief tbeguiled;
A solemn, strange, and mingled air;'T was sad, by fits; by starts,'t was wild.
5. But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure!
Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure,
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail:
Still would her touch the strain +prolong;
And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,
She called on Echo still through all her song;
And where her sweetest theme she chose,
A soft, +responsive voice was heard at every close:
And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair.
6. And longer had she sung, but with a frown,
Revenge impatient rose.
He threw his blood-stain'd sword in thunder down,
And, with a withering look,
The war-denouncing trumpet took,
And blew a blast so loud and dread,
Were ne'er +prophetic sounds so full of woe;
And ever and anon, he beat
The doubling drum with furious heat;
And though, sometimes, each dreary pause between,
Dejected Pity at his side,
IIer soul-subduing voice applied,
Yet still he kept his wild, unalter'd mien;
While each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from his head.
7. Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fix'd;
Sad reproof of thy distressful state;
Of differing +themes the veering song was mix'd;
And now it courted Love; now, raving, oall'd on Hate.
8.    With eyes uprais'd, as one inspired,
Pale Melancholy sat retired;
And from her wild +sequester'd seat,
In notes by distance made more sweet,
Pour'd through the mellow horn her pensive soul;
And dashing soft from rocks around,
Bubbling runnels join'd the sound:
Through tglades and glooms the mingled measures stole,Or, o'er some +haunted streams, with fond delay,
Round a holy calm +diffusing,
Love of peace and lonely musing,
In hollow murmurs died away.
9. But, oh! how alter'd was its sprightlier tone,
When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,
Her bow across her shoulders flung,
HIer +buskins tgemm'd with morning dew,
Blew an +inspirinig air, that tdale and thicket rung,
The hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known.
The oak crown'd sisters and their chaste-eyed queen,
Satyrs and sylvan boys were seen,
Peeping from forth their alleys green:
Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear,
And Sport leap'd up and seiz'd his beechen spear.
10.     Last, came Joy's +ecstatic trial:
He, with viny crown advancing,
First to the lively pipe his hand address'd;
But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol,
Whose sweet +entrancing voice he lov'd the best.
They would have thought, who heard the strain,
They saw in Tempe's vale her native maids,
Amid the +festal-sounding shades,
To some unwearied +minstrel dancing,
While, as his flying fingers kiss'd the strings,
Love framed with Mirth a gay tfantastic round,
(Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound),
And he, amid his frolic play,
As if he would the charming air repay,
Shook thousand todors from his dewy W'ings.
CXX.- DISCONTENT.- AN ALLEGORY.
PROM ADDISON.
1. IT is a celebrated thought of Socrates, that if all the
misfortunes of mankind were cast into a public" stock, in
order to be equally distributed among the whole species,
those who now  think themselves the most unhappy, would
prefer the share they are already possessed of, before that which
would fall to them by such a division.  Horace has carried
this thought a good deal further, and supposes that the hardships or misfortunes we lie under, are more easy to us, than
those of any other person would be, in case we could change
tconditions with him.
2. As I was ruminating on these two remarks, and seated
in my elbow-chair, I insensibly fell asleep; when, on a
sudden, methought there was a proclamation made by Jupiter,
that every mortal should bring in his griefs and tcalamities,
and throw them together in a heap. There was a large plain
appointed for the purpose. I took my stand in the center of
it, and saw, with a great deal of pleasure, the whole human
species marching, one after another, and throwing down their
several loads, which immediately grew up into a prodigious
mountain, that seemed to rise above the clouds.
3. There was a certain lady of a thin, airy shape, who was
very active in this solemnity. She carried a magnifyingglass in one of her hands, and was clothed in a loose, flowing
robe, embroidered with several figures of fiends and specters,
that discovered themselves in a thousand tchimerical shapes,
as her garments hovered in the wind. There was something
wild and distracted in her looks. Her name was Fancy.
She led up every mortal to the appointed place, after having
very +officiously assisted him in making up his pack, and
laying it upon his shoulders. My heart melted within me,
to see my fellow-creatures groaning under their trespective
burdens, and to consider that +prodigious bulk of human
calamities which lay before me.
4. There were, however, several persons who gave me great
diversion upon this occasion. I observed one bringing in a
pack, very carefully concealed under an old tembroidered
cloak, which, upon his throwing it into the heap, I discovered to
bepoverty. Another, after a great deal of puffing, threw down
his baggage, which, upon examining, I found to be his wl,fe.
There were multitudes of lovers saddled with very +whimsical
burdens, composed of darts and flames; but, what was very
odd, though they sighed as if their hearts would break under
these bundles of calamities, they could not persuade themselves to cast them into the heap, when they came up to it;
but, after a few faint efforts, shook their heads and marched
away, as heavy laden as they came.
5. I saw multitudes of old women throw, down their

wrinkles, and several young ones who stripped themselves of
a tawny skin. There were very great heaps of red noses,
large lips, and rusty teeth. The truth of it is, I was surprised
to see the greatest part of the mountain made up of bodily
tdeformities. - Observing one advancing toward the heap with
a larger cargo than ordinary upon his back, I found, upon
his near approach, that it was only a natural hump, which
he disposed of, with great joy of heart, among this collection
of human miseries.
6. There were, likewise, +distempers of all sorts, though I
could not but observe, that there were many more imaginary
than real. One little packet I could not but take notice of,
which was a complication of all the diseases incident to
human nature, and was in the hand of a great many fine
people. This was called the spleen. But what most of all
surprised me was, that there was not a single vice or folly
thrown into the whole heap: at which I was very much
astonished, having concluded within rmyself, that every one
would take this opportunity of getting rid of his passions,
prejudices, and frailties.
7. I took notice in particular of a very tprofligate fellow,
who, I did not question, came loaded with his crimes, but upon
searching his bundle, I found, that instead of throwing his
guilt from him, he had only laid down his memory. He wts
followed by another worthless rogue, who flung away his
modesty instead of his ignorance.
8. When the whole race of mankind had thus cast away
their burdens, the phantom which had been so busy on this
occasion, seeing me an idle spectator of what had passed, approached toward me. I grew uneasy at her presence, when,
of a sudden, she held her magnifying glass full before my
eyes. I no sooner saw my face in it, than I was startled at
the shortness of it, which now appeared in its utmost taggravation. The +immoderate breadth of the features made me very
much out of humor with my own countenance, upon which,
I threw it from me like a mask. It happened very luckily,
that one who stood by me had just before thrown down his
visage, which, it seems, was too long for him. It was, indeed,
extended to a most shameful length; I believe the very chin
was, modestly speaking, as long as my whole face. We hadboth of us an opportunity of mending ourselves; and all the
contributions being now,brought in, every man was at liberty
to exchange his misfortunes for those of another person.
9. As we stood round the heap, and tsurveyed the several
materials of which it was composed, there was scarce a mortal
in this vast multitude, who did not discover what he thought
pleasures and blessings of life; and wondered how the owners
of them ever came to look upon them as burdens and grievances. As we were regarding very attentively this confusion
of miseries, this chaos of calamities, Jupiter issued a second
proclamation, that every one was now at liberty to exchange
his affliction, and to return to his habitation with any such
other bundle as he should select. Upon this, Fancy began to
bestir herself, and parceling out the whole heap with incredible
tactivity, recommended to every one his particular packet.
The hurry and confusion at this time was not to be expressed.
Some observations, which I made at the time, I shall communicate to the public.
10. A venerable gray-headed man, who had laid down the
colic, and who, I found, wanted an heir to his estate, snatched
up an undutiful son, that had been thrown into the heap by his
angry father. The graceless youth, in less than a quarter of
an hour, pulled the old gentleman by the beard, and had liked
to have knocked his brains out; so that the true father coming
toward him with a fit of the gripes, he begged him to take his
son again, and give him back his colic; but they were +incapable, either of them, to recede from the choice they had made.
A poor galley slave, who had thrown down his chains, took up
the gout in their stead, but made such wry faces, that one
might easily perceive he was no great gainer by the bargain.
11. The female world were very busy among themselves in
tbartering for features; one was ttrucking a lock of gray hairs
for a +carbuncle, and another was making over a short waist
for a pair of round shoulders; but on all these occasions there
was not one of them who did not think the new blemish, as
soon as she had got it into her possession, much more disagreeable than the old one.
12. I must not omit my own particular adventure. My
friend with the long visage had no sooner taken upon him my
short face, but he made such a grotesque figure in it, that asNEW SIXTH READER.
I looked upon him, I could not forbear laughing at myself,
insomuch that I put my own face out of countenance. The
poor gentkleman was so sensible of the ridicule, that I found
he was ashamed of what he had done. On the other side, I
myself had no great reason to triumph, for as I went to touch
my forehead, I missed the place, and clapped my finger upon
my upper lip.  Beside, as my nose was exceedingly tprominent, I gave it two or three unlucky knocks as I was playing my hand about my face, and aiming at some other part of it.
13. I saw two other gentlemen by me, who were in the same
ridiculous circumstances. These had made a foolish swap,
between a couple of thick bandy legs, and two long trap-sticks
that had no calves to them. One of these looked like a man
walking upon stilts, and was so lifted up in the air, above his
ordinary hight, that his head turned round with it, while the
other made such awkward circles, as he attempted to walk,
that he scarce knew how to move forward upon his new supporters.  Observing him to be a pleasant kind of a fellow, I
stuck my cane in the ground, and told him I would lay a bottle
of wine, that he did not march up to it on a straight line, in a
quarter of an hour.
14. The heap was at last distributed among the two sexes,
who made a most piteous sight, as they wandered up and down
under the pressure of their several burdens. The whole plain
was filled with +murmurs and complaints, groans and tlamentations.  Jupiter at length taking compassion on the poor
mortals, ordered them a second time to lay down their loads,
with a design to give every one -his own again. They discharged themselves with a great deal of pleasure; after which,
the phantom, who had led them into such gross delusions, was
commanded to disappear. There was sent in her stead, a
goddess of quite a different figure: her motions were steady
and composed, and her taspect serious, but cheerful.  She,
every now and then, cast her eyes toward heaven, and fixed
them  on Jupiter.  Her name was Patience.  She had no
sooner placed herself by the Mount of Sorrows, than, what I
thought very remarkable, the whole heap sunk to such a
degree that it did not appear a third so big as before. She
afterward returned every man his own proper calamity, and
teaching him how to bear it in the most +commodious manner,he marched off with it contentedly, being very well pleased
that he had not been left to his own choice, as to the kind of
evil which fell to his lot.
15. Beside the several pieces of morality to be drawn from
this vision, I learnt from it, never to repine at my own misfortunes, or to envy the happiness of another; since it is impossible for any man to form a right judgment of his neighbor's
sufferings; for which reason also, I am determined never to
think too lightly of another's complaints, but to regard the sorrows of my fellow-creatures with sentiments of humanity and
compassion.
CXXI.- RESOLUTION OF RUTH.
"AND Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following
after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go: and where thou lodgest, I will
lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: where thou
diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me and moro
also, if aught but death part thee and me."
1. FAREWELL? O no! it may not be;
My firm resolve is heard on high:
I will not breathe farewell to thee,
Save only in my dying sigh.
I know not, that I now could bear
Forever fr6m thy side to part,
And live without a friend to share
The treasur'd sadness of my heart.
2. I did not love, in former years,
To leave thee +solitary now;
When sorrow dims thine eyes with tears,
And shades the beauty of thy brow,
I'll share the trial and the pain;
And strong the furnace fires must be,
To melt away the willing chain
That binds a daughter's heart to thee.
3. I will not'boast a +martyr's might,
To leave my home without a sigh;
The dwelling of my past delight,
The shelter where I hoped to die.
In such a duty, such an hour,
The weak are strong, the timid, brave,
For love puts on an angel's power,
And faith grows mightier than the grave.4. It was not so, ere he we lov'd,
And vainly strove with heaven to save,
Heard the low call of death, and moved
With holy calmness to the grave,
Just at that brightest hour of youth,
When life, spread out, before us lay,
And charm'd us with its tones of truth,
And colors, tradiant as the day.
5. When morning's tears of joy were shed,
Or nature's evening tincense rose,
We thought upon the grave with dread,
And tshudder'd at its dark repose.
But all is alter'd now: of death
The morning +echoes sweetly speak,
And like my lov'd one's dying breath,
The evening +breezes fan my cheek.
6. For rays of heaven tserenely bright,
Have gilt the caverns of the tomb;
And I can tponder with delight,
On all its gathering thoughts of gloom.
Then, mother, let us haste away
To that bless'd land to Israel given,
Where faith, +unsadden'd by decay,
Dwells nearest to its native heaven.
7. We'11l stand within the temple's bound,
In courts by kings and tprophets trod;
We'll bless, with tears, the tsacred ground,
And there be earnest with our God,
Where peace and praise forever reign,
And glorious +anthems duly flow,
Till +seraphs learn to catch the strain
Of heaven's devotions, here below.
8. But where thou goest, I will go;
With thine my earthly lot is cast;
In pain and pleasure, joy and woe,
Will I attend thee to the last.
That hour shall find me by thy side;
And where thy grave is, mine shall be;
Death can but for a time divide
My firm and faithful heart from thee.311
CXXII. - FAMILY OF MARCO BOZZARIS.
FROM STEVENS.
STEVErS was a celebrated American traveler, who visited the family
of Marco Bozzaris, which he describes in this extract.
MARCO BOZZARIS was a leader of the Greeks in their revolution.
He was killed in battle at Missolonghi, a Greek town, in 1823. His
last words were, "To die for liberty is a pleasure, not a pain."
MUSTAPHA PACHA was leader of the Turkish troops.
1. MOVING on beyond the range of ruined houses, though
still within the line of crumbling walls, we came to a spot,
perhaps as interesting as any that Greece, in her best days,
could show. It was the tomb of Marco Bozzaris! No tmonumental marble temblazoned his deeds and fame; a few round
stones, piled over his head, which, but for our guide, we
should have passed without noticing, were all that marked his
grave.
2. I would not disturb a proper treverence for the past,
Time covers, with its dim and twilight glories, both distant
scenes and the men who acted in them; but to my mind,
5Miltiades was not more of a hero at Marathon, or Leonidas at
Thermopylae, than Marco Bazzaris at tMissolonghi.  When
they went out against the hosts of Persia, Athens and Sparta
were great and free, and they had the prospect of glory and
the praise of men,--to the Greeks always dearer than life.
But when the Suli'ote chief drew his sword, his country lay
bleeding at the feet of a giant, and all Europe condemned the
Greek revolution as fool-hardy and desperate.
3. For two months, with but a.few hundred men, protected
only by a ditch, and a slight +parapet of earth, he defended
the town, where his body now rests, against the whole Egyptian army. In stormy weather, living upon bad and unwholesome bread, with no covering but his cloak, he passed his
days and nights in constant tvigil; in every +assault his
sword cut down the foremost assailant; and his voice, rising
above the din of battle, struck terror into the hearts of the
enemy. In the struggle which ended with his life, with two
thousand men, he proposed to attack the whole army of Mustapha Pacha, and called upon all who were willing to die for
their country, to stand forward.NEW SIXTH READER.
4. The whole band advanced, to a man. Unwilling to
sacrifice so many brave men in a death-struggle, he chose
three hundred, the sacred number of the Spartan band, his
true and trusty Suliotes. At midnight, he placed himself at
their head, directing that not a shot should be fired, till he
sounded his bugle; and his last command was, "If you lose
sight of me, seek me in the tpacha's tent."  In the moment
of victory, and while ordering the pacha to be seized, he
received a ball in the loins; his voice still rose above the din
of battle, cheering his men, until he was struck by'another
ball in the head, and borne dead from the field of his glory.
5. But the most interesting part of our day at Missolonghi was to come. Returning from a ramble round the walls,
we noticed a large, square house, which our guide told us,
was the residence of Constantine, the brother of Marco Bozzaris. We were all interested in this intelligence; and our
interest was in no small degree increased., when he added,
that the widow and two of the children of the Suliote chief
were living with his brother. The house was surrounded by
a high stone-wall, a large gate stood invitingly open, and we
turned toward it in the hope of catching a glimpse of the
inhabitants; but before we reached the gate our interest had
increased to such a point, that, after consulting with our
guide, we requested him to say, that if it would not be considered an +intrusion, three travelers, two of them Americans, would feel honored in being permitted to pay their
respects to the widow and children of Marco Bozzaris.
6. We were invited in, and shown into a large room on the
right, where three Greeks were sitting cross-legged on a
tdivan, smoking the long Turkish pipe.  Soon after, the
brother entered, a man about fifty, of middling hight, spare
built, and wearing a Bavarian uniform, as holding a Colonel's
+commission in the service of king Otho. In the dress of the
dashing Suliote, he would have better looked the brother of
Marco Bozzaris, and I might then more easily have recognized the daring warrior, who, on the field of battle, in a
moment of extremity, was deemed, by universal tacclamation,
worthy of succeeding the fallen hero. Now, the straight,
military frock coat, buttoned tight across the breast, the stock,313
tight pantaloons, boots, and straps,,seemed to repress the free
tenergies of the mountain warrior;: and I could not but think
how awkward it must be, for one who had spent his whole
life in a dress which hardly touched him, at fifty, to put on
a stock, and straps to his boots.  Our guide introduced us,
with an tapology for our intrusion. The colonel received us
with great kindness, thanked us for the honor done his
brother's widow, and requested us to be seated, ordering
coffee and pipes.
7. And here, on the very first day of our arrival in Greece,
and from a source which made us proud, we had the first evidence of what afterward met me at every step, the warm feeling
existing in Greece toward America; for almost the first thing
that the brother of Marco Bozzaris said, was to express his
gratitude as a Greek, for the services rendered his country by
-our own; and after referring to the provisions sent out for
his famishing countrymen, his eye sparkled and his cheek
flushed, as he told us, that when the Greek trevolutionary
flag first sailed into the port of Napoli di Romania, among
hundreds of vessels of all nations, an American captain was
the first to recognize and salute it.
8. In a few moments, the widow of Marco Bozzaris
entered.  I have often been disappointed in my +preconceived
notions of personal appearance, but it was not so with the
lady who now stood before me. She looked the widow of a
hero; as one worthy of those Grecian mothers, who gave
their hair for bow-strongs, and their girdles for sword-belts,
and while their heart-strings were cracking, sent their young
lovers from their arms, to fight and perish for their country.
Perhaps it was she that led Marco Bozzaris into the path of
+immortality, that roused him from the wild +guerrillawarfare in which he had passed his early life, and fired him with
the high and holy ambition of freeing his country. Of one
thing I am certain, no man could look her in the face, without finding his wavering purposes fixed, without treading
more firmly in the path of high and honorable enterprise.
She was under forty, tall and stately in person, and habited
in deep black, fit emblem of her widowed condition. We all
rose as she entered the room; and, though living tsecluded,
and seldom  seeing the face of a stranger, she received our
27compliments and returned them with far less tembarrassment,
than we both felt and exhibited.
9. But our embarrassment-at least, I speak for myselfwas induced by an unexpected circumstance. Much as I was
interested in her appearance, I was not insensible to the fact,
that she was accompanied by two young and beautiful girls,
who were introduced to us as her daughters. This somewhat +bewildered me; for, while waiting for their appearance,
and talking with Constantine Bozzaris, I had, in some way,
conceived the idea that the daughters were mere children,
and had fully made up my mind to take them both on my
knee and kiss them; but the appearance of the stately
mother recalled me to the grave of Bozzaris; and the daughters would probably have thought that I was taking liberties,
upon so short an acquaintance, if I had followed up my benevolent purpose in regard to them; so, with the long pipe in
my hand, which at that time, I did not know how to manage
well, I can not flatter myself that I exhibited any of the
advantages of +continental travel.
10. The elderwas about sixteen, and even in the opinion
of my friend, Dr. W., a cool judge in these matters, a beautiful girl, possessing all the elements of Grecian beauty; a
dark, clear complexion; dark hair, set off by a little red cap,
embroidered with gold thread, and a long blue tassel hanging
down behind; and large black eyes expressing a melancholy
quiet, but which might be excited to shoot forth glances of
fire more terrible than her father's sword. Happily too, for
us. she talked French, having learned it from a French marquis, who had served in Greece, and been tdomesticated with
them; but young, and modest, and unused to the company of
strangers, she felt the +embarrassment common to young
ladies, when attempting to speak a foreign language. And
we could not talk to her on common themes. Our lips were
sealed, of course, upon the subject which had brought us to
her house. We could not sound for her the praises of her
gallant father.
11. At parting, however, I told them that the name of
Marco Bozzaris was as familiar in America, as that of a hero
of our own revolution; and that it had been hallowed by the
+inspiration of an American poet; and I added, that if itwould not be unacceptable, on my return to my native country, I would send the ttribute referred to, as an evidence of the
feeling existing in America toward the memory of Marco Bozzaris. My offer was gratefully accepted; and afterward, while
in the act of mounting my horse to leave Missolonghi, our guide,
who had remained behind, came to me with a message from
the widow and her daughters, reminding me of my promise.
12. I make no apology for introducing to the public, the
widow  and daughters of Marco Bozzaris.  True, I was
received by them in private, without any expectation, either
on their part or mine, that all the particulars of the finterview would be noted and laid before the eyes of all who
choose to read. I hope it will not be considered +invading the
tsanctity of private life; but, at all events, I make no apology;
the widow and children of Marco Bozzaris are the property of
the world.
CXXIII. - MARCO BOZZARIS.
FROM HALLECK.
1. AT midnight, in his guarded tent,
The Turk lay dreaming of the hour,
When Greece, her knee in +suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his power.
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore
The ttrophies of a +conqueror;
In dreams, his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch's +signet ring;
Then press'd that monarch's throne, a king;
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden's garden-bird.
2. At midnight, in the forest shades,
Bozzaris rank'd his Suliote band,
True as the steel of their tried blades,
Heroes in heart and hand.
There, had the Persian's thousands stood;
There, had the glad earth drunk their blood,
In old Plataea's day:
And now, there breath'd that haunted air,
The sons of sires who conquer'd there,
With arms to strike, and souls to dare,
As quick, as far as they.INFLECTIONS.
REMARK.-Such questions usually commence with pronouns
or adverbs; as, how, what, who, wience, where, &amp;c.
EXAMPLES.
1. How many books did he purchase-?
2. Why reason ye these things in your hearts-?
3. What see'- you, that you frown so heavily to-day'?
4. Who is here so base that he would be a bondman-?
5. But where is the iron-bound prisoner"?  Where-'?
6. Ah! what is that flame which now bursts on his eye'?
7. Whence this pleasing hope', this fond desire'-,
This longing after immortality-?
ExcEPTIoN.-When questions, usually requiring the
falling inflection, are emphatic or repeated, they take the
rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. Where did you say he had gone'?
2. To whom did you say the blame was to be imputed?
3. What is' he? A knave. What is he?  A knave, I say.
RISING INFLECTION.
RULE IV.-In the introductory part of a sentence,
where the sense is dependent or incomplete, the rising
inflection is generally used.
REMARK.--Wherever there is a pause of any kind while
the sense is incomplete, unless the falling inflection is required
by emphasis or some other principle, the rising inflection is
almost invariably used. It is generally very slight, requiring
an acute and educated ear to discern it, and it is difficult to
teach pupils to distinguish it, though they constantly use it.
It is only necessary to read a sentence in a strict monotone and
then in the usual:manner, to be convinced of this.
EXAMPLES.
1. Nature being exhausted', he quietly resigned himself to his
fate.
2. As the whirlwind passeth', so the wicked are no more.
3. A chieftain to the Highlands bound',
Cries,  Boatman, do not tarry.3. An hour pass'd on; the Turk awoke;
That bright dream was his last:
He woke to hear his tsentries shriek
" To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"
He woke, to die mid flame and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and saber-stroke,
And death-shots falling thick and fast,
As lightning from the mountain-cloud;
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band;
"Strike! till the last arm'd foe expires;
Strike! for your altars and your fires;
Strike! for the green graves of your sires;
God, and your native land!"
4. They fought like brave men, long and well;
They piled the ground with Moslem slain;
They conquer'd, but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.
His few tsurviving +comrades saw
His smile, when rung their proud hurrah,
And the red field was won:
They saw in death his eyelids close,
Calmly as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
5. Come to the bridal-chamber, Death;
Come to the mother, when she feels
For the first time, her first-born's breath;
Come, when the bless-ed seals
Which close the tpestilence, are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke;
Come, in consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake's shock, the ocean storm,
Come, when the heart beats high and warm,
With +banquet song, and dance, and wine,
And thou art terrible; the tear,
The groan, the +knell, the tpall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear
Of tagony, are thine.
But to the hero, when his sword
Has won the battle for the free,
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanksof millions yet to be.317
6. Bozzaris  with the tstori'd brave,
Greece nurtur'd in her glory's prime,
Rest thee; there is no prouder grave,
Even in her own proud clime.
We tell thy doom without a sigh,
For thou art Freedom's now, and Fame's,
One of the few, the timmortal names,
That were not born to die.
CXXIV. -SONG OF THE GREEK BARD.
FROM BYRON.
GEORGE GORDON BYRON, one of the most distinguished of English poets,
was born in London, in 1788. His poems are numerous, and display astonishing skill in versification, a wonderful perception of the sublime and beautiful, and an intellectual power, perhaps never surpassed. Unfortunately,
however, his great genius was exerted too much against all that is good, if
not in favor of all that is evil. He embarked in the cause of the Greek
revolution, and died at Missolonghi, in 1824.
A modern Greek is here supposed to compare the present +degeneracy of
his country with its ancient glory, and to utter his lamentations in the words
of the song. The KING referred to in the 4th stanza is Xerxes, king of
Persia.
1. THE Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
Where burning +Sappho lov'd and sung,
Where liv'd the arts of war and peace,
Where +Delos rose and tPhoebus sprung I
tEternal summer gilds them yet,
But all, except their sun, is set.
2. The Scian and Teian muse,
The hero's heart, the lover's lute,
Have found the fame your shores refuse;
Their place of birth alone is mute
To sounds that echo further west,
Than your sire's " Islands of the Blest."
3. The mountains look on +Marathon,
And Marathon looks on the sea:
And musing there an hour alone,
I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
For, standing on the Persian's grave,
I could not deem myself a slave.4. A king sat on the rocky brow
Which looks o'er sea-born +Salamis;
And ships by thousands lay below,
And men and nations, all were his!
He counted them at break of day,
And when the sun set, where were they?
5. And where are they? And where art thou,
My country? On thy voiceless shore
Th' +heroic lay is tuneless now,
Th' heroic bosom beats no more I
And must this +lyre, so long divine,
tDegenerate into hands like mine?
6. Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
Must we but blush? Our fathers bled.
Earth! render back from out thy breast
A remnant of our Spartan dead!
Of the three hundred, grant but three,.To make a new +Thermopylae!
7. What, silent still? and silent all?
Ah! no: the voices of the dead
Sound like a distant ttorrent's fall,
And answer, " Let one living head,
But one arise,-we come, we come!"'T is but the living who are dumb.
8. In vain! in vain!--strike other chords;.Fill high the cup with Samian wine  
Leave battle to the Turkish +hordes,
And shed the blood of Scio's vine I
Hark! rising to. the +ignoble call,
How answers each bold tbacchanal!
9. You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet;
Where is the Pyrrhic +phalanx gone?
Of two such lessons, why forget
The nobler and the manlier one?
You have the letters Cadmus gave;
Think you he meant them for a slave?
10. Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
We will not think of themes like these I
It made tAnacreon's song divine!
He serv'd, but serv'd Polycrates,
A tyrant: but our masters then
Were still at least our countrymen.11. The tyrant of the Chersonese
Was freedom's best and bravest friend:
That tyrant was Miltiades!
O! that the present hour would lend
Another tdespot of the kind!
Such chainis as his were sure to bind.
12. Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
Our virgins dance beneath the shade;
I see their glorious, black eyes shine;
But gazing on each glowing maid,
My own the burning tear-drop laves,
To think such breasts must pillow slaves.
13. Place me on Sunium's marble steep,
Where nothing, save the waves and I,
May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;
There, swan-like, let me sing and die;
A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine;
Dash down yon cup of Samian wine.
CXXV. - Ol-HE REMOVAL OF THE BRITISH TROOPS.
EXTRACT from Lord Chatham's speech, in favor of the removal of
the British troops from Boston, delivered in the House of Lords,
January 20, 1775.
1. MY LORDS: When I urge this measure of recalling the
troops from Boston, I urge it on the pressing principle, that
it is necessarily preparatory to the restoration of your peace,
and the establishment of your prosperity. It will then appear,
that you are disposed to treat +amicably and +equitably; and to
consider, revise, and repeal those violent acts and declarations
which have tdisseminated confusion throughout your empire.
2. Resistance to your acts was necessary, as it was just;
and your vain declarations of the tomnipotence of parliament,
and your imperious doctrines of the necessity of submission,
will be found equally impotent to convince, or to enslave your
fellow-subjects in America, who feel, that tyranny, whether
exercised by an individual part of the +legislature, or by the
bodies which compose it, is equally +intolerable to British
subjects.  I therefore urge and conjure your lordships, imilediately, to adopt this t+conciliating measure. I will pledgemyself for its immediately producing conciliating effects, by
its being thus well-timed; but, if you delay, till your vain
hope shall be accomplished of triumphantly +dictating terms
of treconciliation, you delay forever.
3. But admitting that this hope (which, in truth, is desperate,) should be accomplished, what do you gain by the
interposition of your victorious famity?  You will be untrusted and unthanked. Adopt this measure, then, and allay
the tferment prevailing in America, by removing the cause;
a cause, tobnoxious and unserviceable; for the merit of our
army can only be in action. Its force would be most +disproportionately exerted against a brave, generous, and united
people, with arms in their hands, and courage in their hearts;
three millions of people, the genuine descendants of a valiant
and pious ancestry, driven to those deserts by the narrow
tmaxims of a superstitious tyranny.
4. And is the spirit of persecution never to be appeased?
Are the brave sons of those brave forefathers to inherit their
sufferings as they have inherited their virtues? Are they to
sustain the affliction of the most oppressive aqd unexampled
tseverity, and finally, because it is the wish.:4 the ministry,
be condemned unheard? My lords, the Americans have been
condemned, unheard. The indiscriminate hand of vengeance
has lumped together innocent and guilty; and, with all the
formalities of hostility has blocked up the town of Boston,
and reduced to beggary and famine, its thirty thousand
inhabitants.
5. But, ministers say, that the union in America can not
last. Ministers have more eyes than I have, and should have
more ears; but, with all the information I have been able to
procure, I can pronounce it a union, solid, permanent, and
effectual. It is based upon an unconquerable spirit of independence, which is not new among them. It is, and has ever
been, their established principle, their confirmed tpersuasion;
it is their nature and their doctrine.
6. I remember, some years ago, when the repeal of the
stamp act was in agitation, conversing, in a friendly confidence,
with a person of undoubted respect and +authenticity on that
subject: and he assured me, with a certainty which his judgmeunt and opportunity gave him, that these were the +prevalent321
and steady principles of America; that you might destroy
their towns, and cut them off from the +superfluities, perhaps,
the conveniencies of life; but that they were prepared to despise your power, and would not lament their loss, while they
have-what, my lords? their woods and their liberty!
7. When your lordships look at the papers ttransmitted
us from America; when you consider their decency, firmness,
and wisdom, you can not but respect their cause, and wish to
make it your own. For myself, I must declare and avow,
that, in all my reading and observation, and it has been my
favorite study,-I have read +Thucydides, and have studied
and admired the master states of the world-that, for solidity of reasoning, force of +sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion, under such a +complication of difficult circumstances,
no nation or body of men, can stand in preference to the
-general congress at Philadelphia.
8. I trust it is obvious to your lordships, that all attempts
to impose tservitude upon such men; to establish tdespotism over such a mighty tcontinental nation, must be vain;
must be fatal. We shall be forced tultimately to retract; let
us retract while we can, not when we must. I say we must
necessarily undo these violent, oppressive acts; they must be
repealed; you will repeal them; I pledge-myself for it, that
you will, in the end, repeal them; I stake my reputation on
it; I will consent to be taken for an idiot, if they are not
finally repealed. Avoid, then, this humiliating, this disgraceful necessity. With a dignity becoming your exalted situation, make the first advances to concord, to peace, and happiness; for that is your true dignity, to act with prudence
and justice.
9. Every motive, therefore, of justice and of +policy, of
dignity and of prudence, urges you to allay the "ferment in
America, by a removal of your troops from Boston; by a
repeal of your acts of parliament, and by a +demonstration
of your amicable disposition toward your colonies. On the
other hand, every danger and every hazard timpend, to deter
you from perseverance in your present ruinous measures.
Foreign war is hanging over your heads by a slight and brittle
thread, and France and Spain are watching your conduct, and
waiting for the maturity of your errors.NEW SIXTH READER.
10. To conclude, my lords, if the ministers thus persevere in misadvising and misleading the king, I will not say
that they can +alienate the affections of his subjects from
his crown; but I will affirm, that they will make the crown
not worth his wearing! I will not say, that the king is
betrayed; but I will pronounce, that the kingdom is undone!
CXXVI. - BATTLE OF BEAL' AN DUINE.
FROM WALTER SCOTT.
BEAL' AN DuiNE, an abbreviation for Beallach an Duine, is the name of a
pass or +defile between -two eminences, where the battle described in this
extract is supposed to have taken place. The parties in this battle were the
forces of James V. of'Scotland, on one side, and those of Roderick Dhu, a
rebel subject of the king, on the other. Roderick himself had been previously taken prisoner, and was now confined. The minstrel who describes
the battle is admitted to see his captive master, Roderick, and at his command +portrays, in this wild burst of poetry, the engagement and utter
defeat of the rebel troops. Trosach was the name of the region in which
lay the glen of Beal' an Duine. Moray and Mar were the chiefs at the
head of the king's forces. Clan-Alpine was the name of Roderick's clan,
and the forces of this party lay concealed in the glen, intending to surprise their enemies as they approached, but were themselves entirely
defeated, as described in this sketch.
TINCHEL; a circle of hunters closing around the game.
ERNE; Scotch for heron. BOUNE; equipped.
1. TEE minstrel came once more to view
The eastern ridge of Ben-venue,
For ere he parted, he would say
"Farewell to lovely Loch-Achray."
Where shall he find in foreign land,
So lone a lake, so sweet a +strand?
There is no breeze upon the +fern,
No ripple on the lake,
Upon her +aerie nods the erne,
The deer has sought the brake;
The small birds will not sing aloud,
The springing trout lies still,
So darkly glooms yon thunder-cloud,
That +swathes, as with a purple shroud,
Benledi's distant hill.
2. Is it the thunder's solemn sound
That mutters deep and dread?Or echoes from the groaning ground
The warrior's measur'd tread?
Is it the lightning's quivering glance
That on the thicket streams?
Or do they flash on spear and lance,
The sun's retiring beams?
I see the dagger crest of Mar,
I see the Moray's silver star
Wave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,
That up the lake comes winding far.
To hero, boune for battle-strife,
Or bard of +martial lay,'T were worth ten years of peaceful life,
One glance at their array.
3. Their light-arm'd archers far and near,
Survey'd the tangled ground:
Their center ranks, with pike and spear,
A twilight forest frown'd;
Their barbed horsemen in the rear
The stern +battalia crown'd.
No +cymbal clash'd, no +clarion rang,
Still were the pipe and drum;
Save heavy tread and armor's clang,
The sullen march was dumb.
4. There breath'd no wind their crests to shake
Or wave their flags abroad:
Scarce the frail +aspen seem'd to quake,
That shadow'd o'er their road;
Their +vanward scouts no tidings bring,
Can rouse no lurking foe,
Nor spy a trace of living thing,
Save when they stirr'd the roe;
The host moves like a deep sea wave,
Where rise no rocks, its pride to brave,
High-swelling, dark, and slow.
The lake is,pass'd, and now they gain
A narrow and a broken plain,
Before the Trosach's rugged jaws:
And here, the horse and spearmen pause,
While to explore a dangerous glen,
Dive through the pass the archer men.
5. At once there rose so wild a yell
Within that dark and narrow dell,As all the fiends from heaven that fell,
IIad peal'd the banner-cry of hell I
Forth from the pass, in tumult driven,
Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
The +archery appear.
For life! for life! their flight they ply;
While shriek, and shout, and battle-cry,
And plaids and bonnets waving high,
And broad-swords flashing to the sky,
Are maddening in their rear.
6. Onward they drive in dreadful race,
Pursuers and pursued;
Before that tide of flight and chase,
How shall it keep its rooted place,
The spearmen's twilight wood?
"Down! down!" cried Mar, "your lances down I
Bear back both friend and foe!"
Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
That tserried grove of lances brown
At once lay level'd low;
And closely shouldering side to side,
The bristling ranks the onset bide.
" We'11 quell the savage 4mountaineer,
As their Tinchel cows the game!
They come as fleet as mountain deer,
We'11 drive them back as tame."
7. Bearing before them in their course
The relics of the archer force,
Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,
Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.
Above their tide, each broad-sword bright
Was +brandishing like gleam of light,
Each +targe was dark below;
And with the ocean's mighty swing,
When heaving to the tempest's wing,
They hurl'd them on the foe.
I hoe'rd the lance's shivering crash,
As when the whirlwind rends the ash;
I heard the broad-sword's deadly clang,
As if a hundred +anvils rang;
But Moray wheel'd his +rereward rank
Of horsemen, on Clan-Alpine's flank;
"My banner-man advance!
324325
I see," he cried, " their columns shake:
Now, gallants! for your ladies' sake,
Upon them with the lance!"
8. The horsemen dash'd among the rout
As deer break through the broom;
Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,
They soon made +lightsome room.
Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne;
Where, where was Roderick then?
One blast upon his bugle-horn
Were worth a thousand men.
And +refluent through the pass of fear,
The battle's tide was pour'd;
Vanish'd the Saxon's struggling spear,
Vanish'd the mountain sword.
As Bracklinn's +chasm, so black and steep
Receives her roaring +linn,
As the dark caverns of the deep
Suck the wild whirlpool in,
So did the deep and darksome pass
Devour the battle's mingled mass;
None linger now upon the plain,
Save those who ne'er shall fight again.
CXXVII.- THE BAPTISM.
FRnOM WILSON.
JOHN WILSON, late Professor in the University of Edinburgh,
Scotland, is better known as the principal editor of Blackwood's
Magazine, and its chief contributor, under the name of Christopher
North. He has written numerous interesting tales, descriptive of
Scotch life and manners.
KIRK; Scotch for Church. KITTLE; dangerous, ticklish.
1. THE rite of baptism had not been performed for several
months in the kirk of Lanark.  It was now the hottest time
of persecution; and the inhabitants of that parish found
other places in which to worship God, and celebrate the
+ordinances of religion. It was now the sabbath day, and
a small Cbngregation of about a hundred souls, had met for
divine service, in a place more magnificent than any temple4. As he spoke without fear of consequences', so his actions
were marked with the most unbending resolution.
5. Speaking in the open air", at the top of the voice", is an
admirable exercise.
6. If then, his Providence", out of our evil, seek to bring forth
good', our labor must be to prevent that end.
7. He", born for the universe', narrowed his mind,
And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.
REMARK.-Words used for the person or thing addressed, are included in this rule.
8. Brother", give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick",
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.
9. Oh Lancaster", I fear thy overthrow.
10. Ye crags' and peaks', I'm with you once again.
EXCEPTION 1.--Relative emphasis often reverses this
and the first rule, because emphasis is here expressed
in part by changing the usual inflections.
EXAMPLES.
1. If you care not for your property", you surely value your
life'.
2. If you will not labor for your owns advancement, you should
regard that of your children'.
3. It is your place to obey", not to command'.
4. Though by that course he should not destroy his reputation',
he will lose all self-respect'.
EXCEPTION 2.-The names of persons addressed in a
formal speech, or when used emphatically, have thefalling inflection.          EXAMPLES.
EXAMPLES.
1. Romans, countrymen, and lovers', hear me for my cause, &amp;c.
2. Gentlemen of the jury", I solicit your attention, &amp;c.
3. Oh Hubert-, Hubert", save me from these men.
RULE V.-Negative sentences and members of sentences usually require the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. It is not by starts of application that eminence can be
attained".
29that human hands had ever built to Deity.  The congregation had not assembled, to the toll of the bell, but each heart
knew the hour and observed it; for there are a hundred sundials among the hills, woods, moors, and fields; and the
shepherd and the peasant see the hours passing by them, in
sunshine and shadow.
2. The church in which they were assembled was hewn by
God's hand, out of the eternal rock. A river rolled its way
through a mighty chasm of cliffs, several hundred feet high,
of which the one side presented tenormous masses, and the
other, corresponding trecesses, as if the great stone girdle
had been rent by a tconvulsion. The channel was overspread with prodigious tfragments of rocks or large loose
stones, some of them smooth and bare, others containing
soil and verdure in their rents and fissures" and here and
there, crowned with shrubs and trees.  The eye could at once
command a long-stretching tvista, seemingly closed and shut
up at both extremities by the tcoalescing cliffs. This majestic reach of river contained pools, streams, and twaterfalls innumerable; and when the water was low-which was
now the case, in the common drought-it was easy to walk
up this scene with the calm, blue sky overhead, an utter and
sublime solitude.
3. On looking up, the soul was bowed down by the feeling of that prodigious hight of tunscalable, and often overhanging cliff. Between the channel and the summit of the
far textended precipices, were perpetually flying rooks and
wood pigeons, and now and then a hawk, filling the profound
abyss with their wild tcawing, deep murmur, or shrilly shriek.
Sometimes a heron would stand erect and still, on some little
stone island, or rise up like a white cloud along the black
walls of the chasm, and disappear. Winged creatures alone
could inhabit this region. The fox and wild-cat chose more
accessible haunts. Yet, here came the persecuted Christians
and worshiped God, whose hand hung over their head those
magnificent pillars and arches, scooped out those galleries
from the solid rock, and laid at their feet the calm water, in
its transparent beauty, in which they could see themselves
sitting in reflected groups, with their bibles in their hands.
4. Here, upon a semi-circular ledge of rocks, over a narrowchasm of which the tiny stream played in a murmuring
waterfall, and divided the congregation into two equal parts,
sat about a hundred persons, all devoutly listening to their
minister, who stood before them on what might be called a
small, natural pulpit of living stone.  Up to it there led a
short flight of steps, and over it waved the canopy of a tall,
graceful birch-tree. The pulpit stood in the middle of the
channel, directly facing the congregation, and separated from
them by the clear, deep, sparkling pool, into which the scarce
heard water poured over the blackened rock. The water, as
it left the pool, separated into two streams, and flowed on
each side of that altar, thus placing it in an island, whose
large mossy stones were richly tembowered under the golden
blossoms and green tresses of the broom.
5. At the close of divine service, a row of maidens, all
clothed in purest white, came gliding off from the congregation, and crossing the murmuring stream  on stepping
stones, arranged themselves at the foot of the pulpit, with
those who were about to be baptized. Their devout fathers,
just as though they had been in their own kirk, had been
sitting there during worship, and now stood up before the
minister. The tbaptismal water, taken from that tpellucid
pool, was lying, consecrated, in an appropriate +receptacle,
formed by the upright stones that composed one side of the
pulpit, and the holy rite proceeded.
6. Some of the younger ones in that semicircle, kept gazing down into the pool, in which the whole scene was reflected; and now and then, in spite of the grave looks and
+admonishing whispers of their elders, letting fall a pebble into the water, that they might judge of its depth, from
the length of time that elapsed before the clear air-bells
lay sparkling on the agitated surface. The rite was over, and
the religious service of the day closed by a psalm. The
mighty rocks hemmed in the holy sound, and sent it in a
more +compact volume, clear, sweet, and strong, up to heaven.
When the psalm ceased, an echo, like a spirit's voice was
heard dying away, high up among the magnificent t+architecture of the cliffs; and once more might be noticed in the
silence, the reviving voice of the waterfall.
7. Just then, a large. stone fell from the top of the cliffinto the pool, a loud voice was heard, and a plaid was hung
over on the point of a shepherd's staff. Their wakeful sentinel had descried danger, and this was his warning. Forthwith, the congregation rose. There were paths, dangerous to
+unpracticed feet, along the ledges of the rocks, leading up to
several caves and places of concealment. The more active
an-d young assisted the elder, more especially the old pastor,
and the women with the infants; and many minutes had not
elapsed, till not a living creature was visible in the channel
of the stream, but all of them were hidden, or nearly so, in
the clefts and caverns.
8. The shepherd, who had given the alarm, had lain down
again instantly in his plaid on the green-sward, upon the
summit of these precipices. A party of soldiers was immediately upon him, and demanded what signals he had been
making, and to whom; when one of them looking over the
edge of the cliff, exclaimed, " See, see! Humphrey, we have
caught the whole tabernacle of the Lord in a net, at last.
There they are, praising God among the stones of the river
lilouss. These are the Cartland Craigs. A noble tcathedral!" " Fling the lying sentinel over the cliffs. Ilere is a
+canting tcovenanter for you, deceiving honest soldiers on
the very sabbath day. Over with him, over with him; out
of the gallery into the pit." But the shepherd had vanished
like a shadow, and mixing with the tall, green broom and
bushes, was making his unseen way toward a wood. " Satan has
saved his servant; but come, my lads, follow me. I know the
way down into the bed of the stream, and the steps up to
Wallace's cave. They are called,'kittle nine stanes.' The
hunt's up.  We'll all be in at the death.  Halloo! my
boys, halloo!'
9. The soldiers dashed down a less pecipitous part of the
wooded banks, a little below the "craigs, and hurried up the
channel. But when they reached the altar where the old
gray-haired minister had been seen standing, and the rocks
that had been covered with people, all was silent and solitary;
not a creature to be seen.  "Here is a bible, dropped by
some of them," cried a soldier, and, with his foot, spun it
away into the pool. "A  bonnet, a bonnet," cried another,
"now for the pretty, +sanctified face, that rolled its tdemureeyes below it." But after a few jests and oaths, the soldiers
stood still, eyeing with a kind of mysterious dread, the black
and silent walls of the rocks that hemmed them in, and hearing only the small voice of the stream that sent a profounder
stillness through the heart of that majestic solitude. " What
if these cowardly covenanters should tumble down upon our
heads pieces of rock, from their hiding places? Advance?
or retreat?"
10. There was no reply; for a slight fear was upon every
man. Musket or bayonet could be of little use to men obliged
to clamber up rocks, along slender paths, leading they know
not where. And they were aware that armed men, now-adays worshiped God; men of iron hearts, who feared not th'e
glitter of the soldier's arms, neither barrel nor bayonet; men
of long stride, firm step, and broad breast, who, on the open
field, would have overthrown the tmarshaled line, and gone
first aihd foremost, if a city had to be taken by storm.
11. As the soldiers were standing together irresolute, a
noise came upon their ears like distant thunder, but even
more tappalling; and a slight current of air, as if propelled
by it, passed whispering along the sweet-briers, and the broom,
and the ttresses of the birch trees. It came deepening, and
rolling, and roaring on; and the very Cartland Craigs shook
to their foundation, as if in an earthquake. " The -Lord have
mercy upon us! what is this?" And down fell many of the
miserable wretches on their knees, and some on their faces,
upon the sharp-pointed rocks. Now, it was like the sound
of many myriads of chariots rolling on their iron axles, down
the strong channel of the torrent. The old, gray-haired
minister'issued from the mouth of Wallace's cave, and said in
a loud voice, "The Lord God terrible reigneth!"
12. A water-spout had burst up among the +moorlands, and
the river, in its power, was at hand. There it came, tumbling
along into that long reach of cliffs, and, in a moment, filled it
with one mass of waves. Huge, agitated clouds of foam rode
on the surface of a blood-red torrent. An army must have
been swept off by that flood. The soldiers perished in a moment; but, high up in the cliffs, above the sweep of destruction, were the covenanters, men, women, and children, uttering
prayers to God, unheard by themselves, in the raging thunder.
28CXXVIII. - THE REAPER AND THE FLOWERS.
FROM LONGFELLOW.
1. THERE is a Reaper, whose name is Death,
And, with his tsickle keen,
He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,
And the flowers that grow between.
2. " Shall I have naught that is fair?" saith he;
"Have naught but the bearded grain?
Though the breath of these Mfwers is sweet to me,
I will give them all back again.
3. He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,
IIe kiss'd their drooping leaves;
It was for the Lord of Paradise,
He bound them in his +sheaves.
4. "My Lord has need of these +flowerets gay,"
The Reaper said, and smiled;
"Dear ttokens of the earth are they,
Where he was once a child.
5. "They shall all bloom in the fields of light,
tTransplanted by my care,
And saints, upon their garments white,
These sacred blossoms wear."
6. And the mother gave, in tears and pain,
The flowers she most did love;
She knew she should find them all again,
In the fields of light above.
7. 0, not in cruelty, not in wrath,
The Reaper came that day;'T was an angel visited the green earth,
And took the flowers away.331
CXXIX.  BUNYAN'S "PILGRIM'S PROGRESS."
FROM MACAULAY.
JOHN BUNYAN was born in 1628. In the early part of his life, he
was noted for his profligacy and wickedness, but subsequently
reformed and became a preacher of the Baptist denomination. During his imprisonment for holding religious assemblies, he wrote the
celebrated Pilgrim's Progress. He died in 1688.
THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY, the author of this extract, was for
some years member of the English Parliament, and is a man of great
erudition in almost every department of knowledge. His Lays of
Ancient Rome, his Critical and Historical Essays, and his History of England, have a high reputation.
1. THE characteristic peculiarity of the "Pilgrim's Progress" is, that it is the only work of its kind which possesses
a strong human interest. Other +allegories only amuse the
fancy.  The allegory of Bunyan has been read by many
thousands with tears.  There are some good allegories in
Johnson's works, and some of still higher merit in Addison's.
In these performances, there is, perhaps, as much wit and
ingenuity, as in the " Pilgrim's Progress."  But the pleasure
which is produced by the vision of Mirza, or the vision of
Theodore, or the contest between Rest and Labor, is exactly
similar to the pleasure which we derive from one of Cowley's
odes, or from a canto of Hudibras. It is a pleasure which
belongs wholly to the understanding, and in which the feelings have no part whatever.
2. It is not so with the " Pilgrim's Progress." That wonderful book, while it obtains -admiration from the most' tfastidious tcritics, is loved by those who are too simple to
admire it.  Doctor Johnson, all whose studies were tdesultory, and who hated, as he said, to read books through, made
an exception in favor of the " Pilgrim's Progress." That
work, he said, was one of the two or three works which he
wished longer. In the wildest parts of Scotland, the "Pilgrim's Progress" is the delight of the peasantry. In every
nursery, tle "Pilgrim's Progress" is a greater favorite than
Jack the Giant-Killer. Every reader knows the straight and
narrow path, as well as he knows a road in which he has gone
backward and forward a hundred times. This is the highestNEW SIXTH READER.
miracle of genius,.that things which are not, should be'as
though they were; that the imaginations of one mind, should
become the personal recollections of another. And this
miracle, Bunyan, the tinker, has wrought.
3. There is no ascent, no tdeclivity, no resting-place, no
tturnstile, with which we are not perfectly acquainted. The
wicket-gate and the desolate swamp which separates it from
the City of Destruction; the long line of road, as straight as
a rule can make it; the Interpreter's house and all its fair
shows; all the stages of the journey, all the forms which cross
or overtake the pilgrims, giants, and thobgoblins, ill-favored
ones and shining ones; the tall, comely, +swarthy Madam
Bubble, with her great purse by her side, and her fingers
playing with the money; the black man in the bright vesture;
Mr. Worldly Wiseman and My Lord Hategood, Mr. Talkative and Mrs. Timorous; all are actually existing beings to
us. We follow the travelers through their allegorical progress, with interest not inferior to that with which we follow
Elizabeth from Siberia to Moscow, or Jeanie Deans from
Edinburgh to London.
4. Bunyan is almost the only writer that ever gave to the
tabstract, the interest of the +concrete.  In the works of
many celebrated authors, men are mere +personifications.
We have not an Othello, but jealousy; not an Iago, but
perfidy; not a Brutus, but patriotism. The mind of Bunyan, on the contrary, was so imaginative, that personifications,
when he dealt with them, became men. A dialogue between
two qualities, in his dream, has more +dramatic effect than a
dialogue between two human beings in most plays.
5. The style of Bunyan is delightful to every reader, and
invaluable as a study to every person who wishes to obtain a
wide command over the English language. The tvocabulary is the vocabulary of the common people.  There is not
an expression, if we except a few +technical terms of +theology,
which would puzzle the rudest peasant. We have observed
several pages which do not contain'a single word of more
than two syllables. Yet no writer has said more exactly what
he meant to say. For magnificence, for pathos, for tvehement fexhortation, for tsubtle +disquisition, for every purpose of the poet, the orator, and the divine, this homely tdia333
lect, the dialect of plain working men, was perfectly sufficient.
There is no book in our literature, on which we would so readily stake the fame of the old, unpolluted English language;
no book which shows so well, how rich that language is, in
its own proper wealth, and how little it has been improved by
all that it has borrowed.
6. Cowper said, fifty or sixty years ago, that he dared not'name John Bunyan in his verse, for fear of moving a sneer.
We live in better times; and we are not afraid to say that,
though there were many clever men in England during the latter
half of the seventeenth century, there were only two great
creative minds. One of these produced the "Paradise Lost,"
the other the " Pilgrim's Progress."
CXXX.- THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM.
FROM H. K. WHITE.
HENRY lKIRg WHITE was born at Nottingham, England, in 1785. From
his earliest years he exhibited an ardent passion for literature, and through
the kindness of his friends he was enabled to enter the University of Cambridge, where his too great devotion to study brought on a fatal disease.
HIe died in 1806.
1. WHEN +marshal'd on the nightly plain,
The glittering host bestud the sky;
One star alone, of all the train,
Can fix the sinner's wandering eye.
Hark! hark i to God the chorus breaks,
From every host, from every gem;
But one alone, the Savior speaks,
It is the star of Bethlehem.
2. Once, on the raging seas I rode;
The storm was loud, the night was dark,'Ujk ocean yawn'd and rudely blow'd
The wind that toss'd my +foundering bark.
Deep horror then my +vitals froze,
Death-struck, I ceas'd the tide to stem;
When suddenly a star arose,
It was the star of Bethlehem.
3. It was my guide, my light, my all,
It bade my dark +forbodings cease,
And through the storm and danger's thrall,NEW SIXTH READER.
It led me to the port of peace.
Now, safely moor'd, my perils o'er,
I'11 sing, first in night's tdiadem,
Forever and forever more,
The star, the star of Bethlehem.
CXXXI.  THE BEST KIND OF REVENGE.
1. SOME years ago, a +warehouseman in Manchester,
England, published a tscurrilous pamphlet, in which he endeavored to hold up the house of Grant Brothers to ridicule.
William Grant remarked upon the occurrence, that the man
would live to repent of what he had done; and this was conveyed by some tale-bearer to the libeler, who said, " 0, I
suppose he thinks I shall some time or other be in his debt;
but I will take good care of that." It happens, however, that
a man in business can not always choose who shall be his
+creditors. The pamphleteer became a tbankrupt, and the
brothers held an tacceptance of his, which had been *endorsed
to them by the drawer, who had also become a bankrupt.
2. The wantonly-libeled men had thus become creditors
of the libeler!  They now had it in their power to make
him repent of his audacity. IIe could not obtain his certificate without their signature, and without it he could not
enter into business again.  He had obtained the number of
signatures required by the bankrupt law, except one.  It
seemed folly to hope that the firm of," the brothers " would
supply the +deficiency. What! they, who had cruelly been
made the laughing-stock of the public, forget the wrong and
favor the wrong-doer?  He despaired.  But the claims of a
wife and children forced him at last to make th pplication.
Humbled, by misery, he presented himself at tt countinghouse of the wronged.
3. Mr. William  Grant was there alone, and his first
words to the tdelinquent were, c" Shut the door, sir!" sternly
uttered. The door was shut, and the libeler stood trembling
before the libeled. He told his tale, and produced his certificate, which was instantly clutched by'the injured merchant.
"You wrote a pamphlet against us once!" exclaimed Mr.335
Grant.  The supplicant expected to see his tparchment
thrown into the fire. But this was not its tdestination. Mr.
Grant took a pen, and writing something upon the document,
handed it back to the bankrupt. He, poor wretch, expected
to see " rogue, scoundrel, libeler," inscribed; but there was,
in fair round characters, the signature of the firm.
4. " We make it a rule," said Mr. Grant, "never to refuse
signing the certificate of an honest tradesman; and we have
never heard that you were anything else." The tears started
into the poor man's eyes. "Ah," said Mr. Grant, " my'saying was true! I said you would live to repent writing that
pamphlet. I did not mean it as a threat. I only meant that
some day you would know us better, and be sorry you had
tried to injure us. I see you repent of it now." "I do, Idol"
said the grateful man; "I bitterly repent it."  "Well, well,
my dear fellow, you know us now. How do you get on?
What are you going to do?" The poor man stated he had
friends who could assist him when his certificate was obtained.
"But how are you off in the meantime?"
5. And the answer was, that, having given up every farthing to his creditors, he had been compelled to fstint his
family of even common necessaries, that he might be enabled
to pay the cost of his certificate. " My dear fellow, this will
not do; your family must not suffer. Be kind enough to take
this ten-pound note to your wife from me. There, there, my
dear fellow! Nay, do not cry; it will all be well with you
yet. Keep up your spirits, set to work like a man, and you
will raise your head among us yet." The overpowered man
endeavored in vain to express his thanks; the swelling in his
throat forbade words. He put his handkerchief to his face,
and went out of the door, crying like a child.
CXXXII. - THE GLOVE AND THE LION.
FROM LEIGH HUNT.
LEIGH HUNT, an English poet, was born in 1784. His writings, prose and
poetic, are full of life and beauty.
1. KINGa Francis was a +hearty king, and lov'd a royal sport,
And one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;2. It was not an eclipse that caused the darkness at the crucifixion of our Lord-: for the sun and moon were not relatively in a

nurse those wishes into action.
6. It i-s not for your silver bright',
But for your winsome lady.
7. You are not left alone to climb the steep ascent': God is with
you, who never suffers the spirit that rests on him to fail.

The nobles fill'd the benches round, the ladies by their side,
And'mong them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom
he sigh'd:
And truly't was a +gallant thing to see that crowning show,
Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.
2. Ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with
their paws;
With twallowing might and stifled roar, they rolled on one

smother;

She thought, "The Count, my lover, is brave as brave can be,
He surely would do wondrous things to show his love for me;
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;
I'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine."
4. She dropp'd her glove, to prove his love, then look'd at him,
and smiled;
He bow'd, and in a moment leap'd among the lions wild:
The leap was quick, return was quick, he soon regain'd the

Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's
"In faith," cried Francis, "rightly done!" and he rose from
where he sat;
"Not lq,ve," quoth he, " but vanity, sets love a task like that."
CXXXIII.- THE BATTLE OF BLENHEITI.
FROM' SOUTHEY.
1. IT was on a summer evening,
Old Kasper's work was done,
And he, before his cottage door,
Was sitting in the sun,
And by him sported on the green,
His little grandchild Wilhelmino.2. She saw her brother Peterkin
Roll something large and round,
Which he beside the trivulet,
In playing there, had found;
He came to ask what he had found,
That was so large, and smooth, and round.
3. Old Kasper took it from the boy,
Who stood texpectant by;
And then the old man shook his head,
And with a natural sigh,
"'T is some poor fellow's skull," said he,
Who fell in the great victory.
4. I find them in the garden,
For there's many here about;
And often when I go to plow,
The plowshare turns them out!
For many thousand men," said he,
"Were slain in that great victory:"
5. "Now tell us what't was all about,
Young Peterkin, he cries;
While little Wilhelmine looks up,
With wonder-waiting eyes;
"Now tell us all about the war,
And what they kill'd each other for."
6. " It was the English," Kasper cried,
"Who put the French to rout,
But what they kill'd each other for,
I could not well make out.
But every body said," quoth he,
"That't was a tfamnous +victory.
7. "My father liv'd at +Blenheim then,
Yon little stream, hard by;
They burnt his dwelling to the ground,
And he was forced to fly;
No, with his wife and little child, he fled,
Nor had he where to rest his head.
8. " With fire and sword, the country round
Was wasted, far and wide;
And many a nursing mother then,
And new-born baby died;
But things like that, you know must be
At every famous victory.
29
3379. " They say it was a shocking sight
After the field was won;
For many thousand bodies here
Lay rotting in the sun;
But things like that, you know, must be
After a famous victory.
10. "Great praise the Duke of Marlbro' won,
And our young prince, Eugene."
" Why,'t was a very wicked thing'"
Said little Wilhelmine.
" Nay, nay, my little girl," quoth he,
"It was a famous victory.
11. "And every body prais'd the Duke
Who this great fight did win."
"But what good came of it, at last?"
Quoth little Peterkin.
"Why, that I can not tell," said he,
"But't was a glorious victory."
CXXXIV.  TACT AND TALENT.
1. TALENT is something, but tact is everything. Talent is
serious, sober,.grave, and respectable: tact is all that and
more too. It is not a sixth sense, but it is the life of all the
five. It is the open eye, the quick ear, the judging taste, the
keen smell, and the lively touch; it is the iinterpreter of all
riddles, the +surmounter of all difficulties, the remover of
all tobstacles. It is useful in all places, and at all times; it
is useful in solitude, for it shows a man into the world; it is
useful in society, for it shows him his way through the world.
2. Talent is power, tact is skill; talent is weight, tact is
momentum; talent knows what to do, tact knowhow to do it;
talent makes a man respectable, tact will make him respected;
talent is wealth, tact is ready money. For all the practical
purposes, tact carries it against talent ten to one.
3. Take them to the theater, and put them against each
other on the stage, and talent shall produce you a +tragedy
that shall scarcely live long enough to be condemned, while tact
keeps the house in a roar, night after night, with its successful339
tfarces. There is no want of +dramatic talent, there is no
want of dramatic tact; but they are seldom together: so we
have successful pieces which are not respectable, and respectable pieces which are not successful.
4. Take them to the bar, and let them shake their learned
curls at each other in legal +rivalry; talent sees its way clearly,
but tact is first at its journey's end. Talent has many a
compliment from the bench, but tact touches fees. Talent
makes the world wonder that it gets on no faster, tact arouses astonishment that it gets on so fast. And the secret is,
that it has no weight to carry; it makes no false steps; it
hits the right nail on the head; it loses no time; it takes all
hints; and by keeping its eye on the weather-cock, is ready
to take advantage of every wind that blows.
5. Take them into the church. Talent has always something worth hearing, tact is sure of tabundance of hearers;
talent may obtain a living, tact will make one; talent gets a
good name, tact a great one; talent convinces, tact converts;
talent is an honor to the profession, tact gains honor from the
profession.
6. Take them to court: talent feels its weight, tact finds
its way; talent commands, tact is obeyed; talent is honored
with +approbation, and tact is blessed by +preferment. P-lace
them in the senate. Talent has the ear of the house, but
tact wins its heart, and has its votes; talent is fit for employment, but tact is fitted for it. It has a knack of slipping
into place with a sweet silence and glibness of movement, as
a billiard ball tinsinuates itself into the pocket.
7. It seems to know every thing, without learning any
thing.  It has served an +extemporary apprenticeship; it
wants no drilling; it never ranks in the awkward squad; it
has no left hand, no deaf ear, no blind side. It puts on no
look of wondrous wisdom, it has no air of tprofundity, but
plays with the details of place as dextrously, as a well-taught
hand flourishes over the keys of the piano-forte. It has all
the air of common-place, and all the force and power of
genius.NEW SIXTH READER.
CXXXV.  THE VOYAGE OF LIFE: AN ALLEGORY.
FROM DR. JOHNSON.
1. "LIFE," says Seneca, "is a voyage, in the progress of
which we are perpetually changing our scenes; we first leave
childhood behind us, then youth, then the years of +ripened
manhood, then the better and more pleasing part of old age."
2. The perusal of this passage having excited in me a train
of reflections on the state of man, the incessant fluctuation
of his wishes, the gradual change of his disposition to all external objects, and the +thoughtlessness with which he fiQats
along the stream of time, I sank into a slumber amid my
tmeditations, and, on a sudden, found my ears filled with a
tumult of labor, the shouts of +alacrity, the shrieks of alarm,
-the whistle of winds, and the dash of waters.
3. My tastonishment, for a time, trepressed my +curiosity;
but soon recovering myself, so far as to inquire whither we
were going, and what was the cause of such clamor and confusion, I was told that we were launching out into the ocean
of life, that we had already passed the straits of infancy, in
which multitudes had perished, some by the weakness and
+fragility of their vessels, and more by the folly, tperverseness, or +negligence of those who undertook to steer them;
and that we were now on the main sea, abandoned to the
winds and +billows, without any other means of security
than the care of the pilot, whom it was always in our power
to choose among the great numbers that offered their direction
and +assistance.
4. I then looked around with anxious eagerness, and first,
turning my eyes behind me, saw a stream flowing through
flowery islands, which every one that sailed along seemed to
behold with pleasure, but no sooner touched, than the current,
which, though not noisy; or tturbulent, was yet tirresistible,
bore him away. Beyond these islands all was darkness, nor
could any of the passengers describe the shore at which he
first embarked. Before me, and on each side, was an expanse of waters +violently agitated, and covered with so
thick a mist, that the most perspicacious eye could see but a
little way. It appeared to be full of rocks and whirlpools:341
for many sank unexpectedly, while they were courting the gale
with full sails, and insulting those whom they had left behind.
5. So numerous, indeed, were the dangers, and so thick the
darkness, that no caution could confer security. Yet there
were many, who, by false intelligence, betrayed their followers into whirlpools, or, by violence, pushed those whom
they found in their way against the rocks. The current was
tinvariable and unsurmountable. But, though it was impossible to sail against it, or to return to the place that was
once passed, yet it was not so violent as to allow no topportunities for dexterity or courage, since, though none could retreat
from danger, yet they might avoid it by an toblique direction.
6. It was, however, not very common to steer with much
care or prudence; for, by some universal +infatuation, every
man appeared to think himself safe, though he saw his consorts every moment sinking around him; and no sooner had
the waves closed over them, than their fate and their misconduct were forgotten. The voyage was pursued with the same
jocund confidence; every man tcongratulated himself upon
the soundness of his vessel, and believed himself able to
stem the whirlpool in which his friend was tswallowed, or
glide over the rocks on which he was dashed; nor was it
often observed that the sight bf a wreck made any man
change his course; if he turned aside for a moment, he soon forgot the rudder, and left himself again to the tdisposal of chance.
7. This negligence did not proceed from indifference, or
from weariness of their condition; for not one of those, who
thus rushed upon destruction, failed, when he was sinking,
to call loudly upon his +associates for that help which could
not now be given him; and many spent their last moments
in tcautioning others against the folly, by which they were
intercepted in the midst of their course. Their benevolence
was sometimes praised, but their admonitions were unregarded.
8. In the midst of the current of life was the gulf of Intemperance, a dreadful whirlpool, interspersed with rocks, of
which the pointed crags were concealed under water, and the
tops covered with herbage, on which Ease spread +couches of
repose, and with shades where Pleasure warbled the song of
invitation. Within sight of these rocks, all who sail on the
ocean of life must necessarily pass. Reason, indeed, wasalways at hand, to steer the passenger through a narrow
outlet by which they might escape; but few could, by her
tentreaties or tremonstrances, be induced to put the rudder
into her hand, without stipulating that she should approach
so near to the rocks of Pleasure, that they might solace
themselves with a short enjoyment of that +delicious region,
after which they always determined to pursue their course
without any other deviation.
9. Reason was too often prevailed upon so far, by these
promises, as to venture her charge within the *eddy of the
gulf of Intemperance, where, indeed, the +circumvolution
was weak, but yet interrupted the course of the vessel, and
drew it, by insensible rotations, toward the center. She then
repented her +temerity, and, with all her force, endeavored to
retreat; but the draught of the gulf was generally too strong
to be overcome; and the passenger, having danced in circles,
with a pleasing and giddy tvelocity, was at last overwhelmed
and lost.
10. As I was looking upon the variouis fate of the multitude about me, I was suddenly alarmed with an admonition
from some unknown power: "Gaze not idly upon others,
when-thou thyself art sinking. Whence is this thoughtless
"tranquillity, when thou and they are equally tendangered? "
I looked, and seeing the gulf of Intemperance before me,
started and awoke.
CXXXVI. - COLLOQUIAL POWERS OF FRANKLIN.
FROM WIRT.
WILLIAM WIRT, the author of the following extract, was born in
Maryland, in 1772. He was by profession a lawyer, and at the trial
of Aaron Burr, for treason, assisted the Attorney General of the
United States. He was the author of the celebrated letters entitled
The British Spy, and The Old Bachelor; and also of a Life of Patrick
Henry. He died in 1834.
1. NEVER have I known  such a fire-side companion.
Great as he was both as a tstatesman and philosopher, he
never shone in a light more winning, than when he was seen
in a domestic circle. It was once my good fortune to pass343
two or three weeks with him, at the house of a private gentleman, in the back part of Pennsylvania, and we were
confined to the house during the whole of that time, by the
tunintermitting constancy and depth of the snows.  But
confinement never could be felt where Franklin was an
inmate. His cheerfulness and his colloquial powers spread
around him a perpetual spring.
2. When I speak, however, of his tcolloquial powers, I do
not mean to awaken any notion +analogous to that which
Boswell has given us of Johnson.  The conversation of the
latter, continually reminds one of the "pomp and circumstance of glorious war."  It was, indeed, a +perpetual contest for victory, or an arbitrary or despotic exaction of
homage to his superior talents. It was strong, acute, prompt,
splendid, and +vociferous; as loud, stormy, and sublime, as
*those winds which he represents as shaking the Hebrides, and
rocking the old castle which frowned on the dark-rolling sea
beneath.
3. But one gets tired of storms, however sublime they
may be, and longs for the more orderly current of nature.
Of Franklin, no one ever became tired.  There was no
ambition of eloquence, no effort to shine in any thing which
came from him. There was nothing which made any demand
upon either your tallegiance or your admiration. His manner was as unaffected as infancy. It was nature's self. He
talked like an old patriarch; and his plainness and simplicity
put you at once at your ease, and gave you the full and free
possession and use of your faculties. His thoughts were of
a character to shine by their own light, without any adventitious aid. They only required a +medium of vision like
his pure and simple style, to exhibit to the highest advantage
their native tradiance and beauty.
4. His cheerfulness was unremitting. It seemed to be as
much the effect of a tsystematic and salutary exercise of the
mind, as of its superior organization.  His wit was of the
first order. It did not show itself merely in occasional tcoruscations; but without any effort or force on his part, it
shed a constant stream of the purest light over the whole of
his discourse. Whether in the company of commons or
nobles, he was always the same plain man; always mobt perNEW SIXTH R'EADER.
fectly at his ease, with his faculties in full play, and the full
orbit of his genius forever clear and unclouded.
5. And then, the stores of his mind were inexhaustible.
IHe had commenced life with an attention so +vigilant, that
nothing had escaped his observation; and a judgment so
solid, that every incident was turned to advantage.  His
youth had not been wasted in idleness, nor overcast by
intemperance. He had been, all his life, a close and deep
reader, as well as thinker; and by the force of his own
powers, had wrought up the raw materials which he had
gathered from books, with such exquisite skill and +felicity,
that he has added a hundred fold to their original value, and
justly made thepm his own.
CXXXVII. - A CONVERSATIONAL PLEASANTRY.
FROM FRANKLIN.
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN was born in 1706. While apprenticed to the printing
business, he found opportunity for self-improvement, and began to write
anonymously for the New England Courant, pieces which were much admired. His history as a statesman and philosopher is familiar to every
American. He died in 1790.
1. SOME wit-of old-such wits of old there were,
Whose hints showed meaning, whose tallusions, care,--
By one brave stroke, to mark all human kind,
Call'd clear, blank paper, ev'ry infant mind;
Where, still, as opening sense her tdictates wrote,
Fair virtue put a seal, or vice, a blot.
The thought was happy, +pertinent, and true;
Methinks a genius.might the plan pursue.
2. 1, (can you pardon my presumption?) I,
No wit, no genius, yet, for once, will try.
Various the paper various wants produce;
The wants of fashion, elegance, and use.
Men are as various; and, if right I scan,
Each sort of paper represents some man.
3. Pray, note the fop, half powder, and half lace;
Nice, as a band-box were his dwelling place;
He's the gilt-paper, which, apart you store,
And lock from vulgar hands in the +scrutoir.345
4. Mechanics, servants, farmers, and so forth,
Are copy-paper, of inferior worth;
Less prized, more useful, for your desk +decreed;
Free to all pens, and prompt at ev'ry need.
5. The wretch whom +avarice bids to pinch and spare,
Starve, cheat, and +pilfer, to enrich an heir,
Is coarse brown paper, such as peddlers choose
To wrap up +wares, which better men will use.
6. Take next the miser's +contrast, who destroys
Health, fame, and fortune, in a round of joys;
Will any paper match him? Yes, throughout;
He's a true sinking-paper, past all doubt.
7. The retail politician's anxious thought
Deems this side always right, and that, stark naught;
He foams with censure; with +applause he raves;
A dupe to rumors, and a tool of knaves;
He'11 want no type, his weakness to proclaim,
While such a thing as foolscap has a name.
8. The hasty gentleman, whose blood runs high,
Who picks a quarrel, if you step +awry,
Who can't a jest, a hint, or look endure;
What is he? What?  Touch-paper, to be sure.
9. What are our poets, take them as they fall,
Good, bad, rich, poor, much read, not read at all?
Them and their works, in the same class you'11 find;
They are the mere waste-paper of matkind.
10. Observe the maiden I innocently sweet;
She's fair, white-paper, an +unsullied sheet;
On which the happy man whom fate ordains,
May write his name, and take her for his pains.
11. One instance more, and only one, I'11 bring;'T is the great man, who scorns a little thing;
Whose thought, whose deeds, whose +maxims are his own,
Form'd on the feelings of his heart alone.
True, genuine, royal-paper, is his breast;
Of all the kinds most precious, purest, best.31

1. WHATEVER leads the mind +habitually to the Author
of the universe: whatever mingles the voice of nature with
the tinspiration of the Gospel; whatever teaches us to see in
all the chaniges of the world, the varied goodness of Him, in
whom "we live, and move, and have our being," brings us
nearer to the spirit of the Savior of mankind. But it is not
only as encouraging a sincere devotion, that these reflections
are favorable to Christianity; there is something, moreover,
+peculiarly allied to its spirit in such observations of external
nature.
2. When our Savior prepared himself for his temptation,
his agony, and death, he retired to the wilderness of Judea,
to inhale, we may venture to believe, a holier spirit amid its
solitary scenes, and to approach to a nearer +communion with
his Father, amid the sublimest of his works. It is with
similar feelings, and to worship the same Father, that the
Chlristian is permitted to enter the temple of nature, and, by
the spirit of his religion, there is a language +infused into the
objects which she presents, unknown to the worshiper of
former times. To all, indeed, the same objects appear, the
same sun shines, the same heavens are open; but to the
Christian alone it is permitted to know the Author of these
things; to see his spirit "move in the breeze, and blossom in
the spring;" anid to read, in the changes that occur in the
material world, the varied +expression of eternal love. It is
from the influence of Christianity, acoordingly, that the key
has been given to the signs of nature. It was only when the
spirit of God moved on the face of the deep, that order and
beauty were seen in the world.
3. It is, accordingly, peculiarly well worthy of observation,
that the beauty of nature, as felt in modern times, seems to
have been almost unknown to the writers of antiquity. They
described, occasionally, the scenes in which they dwelt;
but,--if we except Virgil, whose gentle mind seems to have
anticipated, in this instance, the influence of the Gospel,never with any deep feeling of their beauty. Then, as now,
the citadel of Athens looked upon the evening sun, and her347
temples flamed in his setting beam; but what Athenian writer
ever described the tmatchless glories of the scene?  Then,
as now, the silvery clouds of the 3Egean sea rolled round her
+verdant isles, and sported in the azure vault of heaven; but
what Grecian poet has been inspired by the sight?
4. The Italian lakes spread their waves beneath a cloudless
sky, and all that is lovely in nature was gathered around
them; yet, even Eustace tells us, that a few detached lines is
all that is left in regard to them by the Roman poets. The
Alps themselves,
"The palaces of nature, whose vast walls
Have tpinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,
And throned eternity in icy halls
Of cold sublimity, where forms and falls
The +avalanche-the thunderbolt of snow,"
even these, the most glorious objects which the eye of man can
behold, were regarded by the ancients with sentiments only of
dismay or horror; as a tbarrier from hostile nations, or as the
dwelling of barbarous tribes. The torch of religion had not
then lightened the face of uature; they knew not the language
which she spoke, nor felt that holy spirit, which, to the Christian, gives the sublimity of these scenes.
5. There is something, therefore, in religious reflections on
the objects or the changes of nature, which is peculiarly fitting
in a Christian teacher. No man will impress them on his
heart without becoming happier and better, without feeling
warmer gratitude for the tbeneficence of nature, and deeper
thankfulness for the means of knowing the Author of this
beneficence which *revelation has afforded.  "Behold the
lilies of the field," says our Savior; " they toil not, neither do
they spin: yet, verily I say unto you, that even Solomon, in
all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these." In these
words, we perceive the deep sense which he entertained of the
beauty even of the minutest works of nature. If the admiration of external objects is not directly made the object of his
tprecepts, it is not, on that account, the less allied to the
spirit of religion; it springs from the revelation which he has
made, and grows with the spirit which he inculcates.
6. The cultivation of this feeling, we may suppose, isNEW SIXTH READER.
tpurposely left to the human mind, that man may be +induced
to follow it from the charms which +novelty +confers; and the
sentiments which it awakens are not expressly enjoined, that
they may be enjoyed as the tspontaneous growth of our own
imagination. While they seem, however, to spring up unbidden in the mind, they are, in fact; produced by the spirit of
religion; -and those who imagine that they are not the fit
subject of Christian instruction, are ignorant of the secret
workings, and'finer +analogies, of the faith which they profess.
CXXXIX. --THE VOICE OF SPRING.
FROM MRS. HEMANS.
1. I COME, I come I ye have call'd me long;
I come o'er the mountains with light and song;
Ye may trace my step o'er the wakening earth,
By the winds which tell of the violet's birth,
By the tprimrose stars in the shadowy grass,
By the green leaves opening as I pass.
2. I have breath'd on the south, and the chestnut flowers
By thousands have burst from the forest bowers,
And the ancient graves and the fallen tfanes,
Are vail'd with wreaths on Italia's plains;
But it is not for me, in my hour of bloom,
To speak of the ruin or of the tomb.
3. I have look'd o'er the hills of the stormy north,
And the tlarch has hung all his tassels forth;
The fisher is out on the sunny sea,
And the reindeer bounds o'er the +pasture free,
And the pine has a fringe of softer green,
And the moss looks bright where no foot hath been.
4. I have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh,'And call'd out each' voice of the deep blue sky,
From the night-bird's lay, in the starry time,
In the groves of the soft Hesperian clime,
To the swan's wild note, by the Iceland lake,
Where the dark fir-branch into +verdure breaks.
5. From the streams and founts I have loos'd the chain,
They are sweeping on to the tsilvery main,349
They are flashing down from the mountain brows,
They are flinging +spray o'er the forest boughs,
They are bursting fresh from their sparry caves,
And the earth +resounds with the joy of waves.
6. Come forth, 0 ye children of gladness, come!
Where the violets lie, may be now your home.
Ye of the rose-lip, and dew-bright eye,
And the bounding footstep, to meet me, fly!
With the +lyre, and the twreath, and the joyous +lay,
Come forth to the sunshine; I may not stay.
7. Away from the dwellings of care-worn men!
The waters are sparkling in grove and glen;
Away from the chamber and silent hearth!
The young leaves are dancing-in breezy mirth;
Their light stems thrill to the wild-wood strains,
And youth is abroad in my green +domains.
8. But ye! ye are changed since ye met me last!
There is something bright from your features pass'd!
There is that come over your brow and eye,
Which speaks of the world, where the flowers must die!
Ye smile! but your smile hath a +dimness set;
Oh! what have ye look'd on, since last we met?
9. Ye are changed, ye are changed! and I see not here
All whom I saw in the vanish'd year:
There were graceful heads, with their ringlets bright,
Which tess'd in the breeze, with a play of light,
There were eyes, in whose glistening laughter lay
No faint tremembrance of dull tdecay.
10. There were steps that flew o'er the tcowslip's head,
As if for a banquet all earth were spread;
There were voices that rung through the +sapphire-sky,
And had not a sound of +mortality!
Are they gone? Is their mirth from the mountains pass'd?
Ye have look'd on death, since ye met me last I
11. I know whence the shadow comes o'er you now,
Ye have strewn the dust on the sunny brow I
Ye have given the lovely to earth's tembrace,
She hath taken the fairest of beauty's race;
With their laughing eyes, and their tfestal crown,
They have gone from among you, in silence, down I12. They are gone from among you, the young and fair;
Ye have lost the +gleam of their shining hair!
But I know of a land, where there falls no blight,
I shall find them there, with their eyes of light!
Where Death,'mid the bloom of the morn may dwell,
I tarry no longer; farewell, farewell!
13. The summer is coming, on soft winds borne;
Ye may press the grape, ye may bind the corn!
For me, I depart to a brighter shore;
Ye are mark'd by care, ye are mine no more.
I go where the lov'd who have left you dwell,
And the flowers are not death's; fare-ye-well, farewell!
CXL. - SUMMER EVENING.
FAoM BRYANT.
1. THE summer day has closed; the sun is set:
Well have they done their office, those bright hours,
The latest of whose train goes softly out
In the red west. The green blade of the ground
Has risen, and herds have cropp'd it; the young twig
Has spread its +plaited +tissues to the sun;
Flowers of the garden and the waste have blown,
And wither'd; seeds have fallen upon the soil
From bursting +cells, and, in their graves, await
Their +resurrection,
2.        Insects from tqhe pools
Have fill'd the air awhile with humming wings,
That now are still'd forever; painted moths
Have wander'd the blue sky, and died again;
The mother-bird hath broken for her brood
Their prison-shells, or shov'd them from their nest,
Plumed for their earliest flight.
3.        In bright talcoves,
In woodland cottages with earthy walls,
In +noisome cells of the tumultous town,
Mothers have clasp'd with joy the new-born babe.
Graves by the lonely forest, by the shore
Of rivers and of ocean, by the ways
Of the +throng'd city, have been hollow'd out,
And fill'd, and closed. This day hath parted friends,351
That ne'er before were parted; it hath knit
New friendships; it hath seen the maiden +plight
EIer faith, and trust her peace to him who long
Hath +woo'd; and it hath heard, from lips which late
Were eloquent of love, the first harsh word,
That told the wedded one her peace was flown.
4. Farewell to the sweet sunshine! one glad day
Is added now to childhood's merry days,
And one calm day to those of quiet age;
Still the +fleet hours run on; and, as I lean
Amid the thickening darkness, lamps are lit
By those who watch the dead, and those who twine
Flowers for the bride. The mother from the eyes
Of her sick infant shades the painful light,
And sadly listens to his quick-drawn breath.
CXLI. - THE CRUSADER AND THE SARACEN.
FROM WALTER SCOTT.
CAFTAN; a kind of loose vest.
1. As the Knight of the Leopard fixed his eyes attentively
on the distant +cluster of palm-trees, which arose beside the
well, assigned for his mid-day station, it seemed to him as if
some object was moving among them.  The distant form
separated itself from the trees which partly hid its motions,
and advanced toward the knight with a speed which soon
showed a mounted horseman, whom his +turban, long spear,
and green caftan floating in the wind, on his nearer approach,
showed to be a +Saracen tecavalier.  "In the desert," saith an
Eastern proverb, " no man meets a friend." The crusader
was totally indifferent whether the infidel, who now approached on his gallant barb, as if borne on the wings of an
eagle, came as friend or foe: perhaps, as a vowed champion
of the Cross, he might rather have preferred the latter. He
disengaged his lance from his saddle, seized it with the right
hand, placed it in rest, with its point half elevated, gathered
up the reins in the left, waked his horse's +mettle with the
spur, and prepared to foncounter the stranger with the calm
self-confidence belonging to the victor in many contests.NEW  SIXTH READER.
2. The Saracen came on at the speedy gallop of an Arab
horseman, managing his steed more by his limbs and the
tinflection of his body, than by any use of the reins, which
hung loose in his left band; so that he was enabled to wield
the light, round buckler of the skin of the rhinoceros, ornamented with silver loops, which he wore on his arm, swinging
it, as if he meant to oppose its slender circle to the tformidable thrust of the western lance.
3. His own long spear was not. +couched, or leveled like
that of his tantagonist, but grasped by the middle with his
right hand, and tbrandished at arm's length, above his head.
As the cavalier approached his enemy, at full +career, he
seemed to expect that the Knight of the Leopard should put
his horse to the gallop, to encounter him. But the Christian
knight, well acquainted with the customs of eastern warriors,
did not mean to exhaust his good horse by any unnecessary
exertion; and, on the contrary, made a dead halt, confident that
if the enemy advanced to the actual shock, his own weight
and that of his powerful charger would give him sufficient
advantage, without the tmo&amp;mentum gained by rapid motion.
4. Equally sensible and tapprehensive of such a probable
result, the Saracen cavalier, when he had approached toward
the Christian within twice the length of his lance, wheeled
his steed to the left, with inimitable tdexterity, and rode
twice around his antagonist, who, turning without quitting
his ground, and presenting his front constantly to his
enemy, tfrustrated his attempts to attack him on an unguarded point; so that the Saracen, wheeling his horse,
was fain to retreat to the distance of a hundred yards. A
second time, like a hawk attacking a heron, the heathen
renewed the charge, and, a second time, was fain to retreat
without coming to a close struggle.
5. A third time, he approached in the same manner, when
the Christian knight, desirous to terminate this +illusory
warfare, in which he might, at length, have been worn out
by the activity of his foeman, suddenly seized the +mace
which hung at his saddle-bow, and with a strong hand and
unerring aim, hurled it against the head of his assailant.
The Saracen was just aware of the formidable +missile, in
time to interpose his light buckler betwixt the mace and his353
head; but the violence of the blow forced the buckler down
on his turban, and, though that defense also contributed to
deaden its violence, the Saracen was beaten from his horse.
6. Ere the Christian could avail himself of this mi'shal,
his nimble foeman sprung from the ground, and, calling on
his steed, which instantly returned to his side, he leaped into
his seat, and regained all the advantage of which the Knight
of the Leopard had hoped to deprive him. But the latter
had, in the mean while, recovered his tmace, and the eastern
cavalier, who remembered the strength and tdexterity with
which his antagonist had aimed it, seemed to keep cautiously
out of reach of that weapon, of which he had so lately felt
the force; while he showed his purpose of waging a distant
warfare with missile weapons of his own. Planting his long
spear in the sand at a distance from the scene of combat, he
strung, with great address, a short bow which he carried at
his back, and, putting his horse to the gallop, once more
described two or three circles, of a wider extent than formerly,
in the course of which he discharged six arrows with such
unerring skill, that the goodness of the knight's armor alone
saved him from being wounded in as many places.
7. The seventh shaft apparently found a less perfect part
of the tharness, and the Christian- dropped heavily from his
horse. But what was the surprise of the Saracen, when, dismounting to examine the condition of his tprostrate enemy,
he found himself suddenly within the grasp of the European,
who had had recourse to this tartifice to bring his enemy
within his reach! Even in this deadly tgrapple, the Saracen
was saved by his tagility and presence of mind. He unloosed
the sword-belt, in which the Knight of the Leopard had fixed
his hold, and thus teluding the fatal grasp, mounted his
horse, which seemed to watch his motions with the intelligence
of a human being, and again rode off.
8. But in the last encounter, the Saracen haa lost his sword
and his quiver of arrows, both of which were attached to the
girdle, which he was obliged to abandon. He had also lost
his turban in the struggle. These disadvantages seemed to
incline the Moslem to a truce. He approached the Christian
with right hand extended, but no longer in a +menacing attitude.  "There is truce betwixt our nations," he said; "where-;J.fore should there be war betwixt thee and me? Let there be
peace betwixt us."  "I am well contented," answered he of
the Leopard; "but what security dost thou offer that thou
wilt observe the truce?" "' The word of a follower of the
Prophet was never broken," answered the temir. ", It is thou,
brave Nazarene, from whom I should demand security, did I
not know that treason seldom dwells with courage." fthe
tcrusader felt that the confidence of the Moslem made him
ashamed of his own doubts. -" I pledge thee on the cross of
my sword," he said, laying his hand upon the weapon as he
spoke, "I will be a true companion to thee, Saracen, while
our fortune wills that we remain in company."
9. "By Mohammed, Prophet of Allah," replied his late
foeman, "there is not treachery in my heart toward thee.
And now, twend we to yonder fountain, for the hour,of rest
is at hand, and the stream had hardly touched my lip, when I
was called to battle by thy approach." The Knight of the
Leopard yielded a ready and tcourteous assent; and the late
foes, without an angry look or gesture of doubt, rode, side by
side, to the little cluster of palm trees.
CXLII.- THE RAVEN.
FROM POE.
EDGAR A. POE, an American poet, was born at Baltimore in 1811. He
graduated at Jefferson University with the highest honors. His prose writings are quite numerous. His poems are few, bhut many of them evince high
poetic talent. He died in 1849.
1. Once upon a midnight dreary, while I ponder'd weak and weary,
Over many a tquaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chambersdoor,
"'T is some visitor," I mutter'd, "tapping at my chamber door;
Only this and nothing more."
2. Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor;
Eagerly I wish'd the morrow: vainly I had tried to borrow,
From my books, +surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore,
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,
Nameless here for evermore.3. And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrill'd me, fill'd me with +fantastic terrors, never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;
This it is and nothing more."
4. Presently my soul grew stronger, hesitating then no longer,
" Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you." Here I open'd wide the
door.
Darkness there, and nothing more.
5. Deep into that darkness +peering, long I stood there, wondering,
fearing,                                         [before;
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken, was the whisper'd word,
"Lenore! "
Merely this, and nothing more.
6. Then into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before;
"Surely," said I, "surely, that is something at my window
+lattice;
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery texplore,
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore,'T is the wind, and nothing more!"
7. Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a +flirt and
flutter,
In there stepp'd a stately raven of the saintly days of +yore:
Not the least +obeisance made he; not an instant stopp'd or
stay'd he;
But with tmien of lord or lady, perch'd above my chamber door,
Perch'd upon a tbust of Pallas, just above my chamber door,
Perch'd, and sat, and nothing more.
8. Then this +ebony bird tbeguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern tdecorum of the countenance -it wore;
"Though thy fcrest be shorn and shaven, -thou," I said, " art
sure no craven,7. And this man is called a statesman. A statesman'- Why,
he never invented a decent humbug.

Herschel', of modern times the boast.
9. I can not say, sir, which of these motives influence the advocates of the bill before us; a bill-', in which such cruelties are
proposed as are yet unknown among the most savage nations.
10. The man who was not only pardoned, but distinguished by
you with the highest honors, is charged with an intention to kill
you in your own house: an intention', of which, unless you
imagine that he is utterly deprived of reason, you can not suspect
him.

Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly
shore,                                          [shore!"
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian
tQuoth the raven, "Never more."
9. Much I marvel'd this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though'its answer little meaning, little frelevancy bore;
For we can not help agreeing that no livinghuman being
Ever yet was bless'd with seeing bird above his chamber door,
Bird or beast upon the ~sculptur'd bust above his chamber door,
With such name as " NTevermore."'
10. But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spake only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did out-pour,
Nothing further then he utter'd, not a feather then he flutter'd,
Till I scarcely more than mutter'd, " other friends have flown
before,
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before,
Then the bird said, " Nevermore."
11. Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
" Doubtless," said I, " what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful +disaster,
Follow'd fast and follow'd faster, till his song one burden bore,
Till the tdirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore
Of' Nevermore,' of'Nevermore."'
12. But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheel'd a cushion'd seat in front of bird, and bust,
and door;
Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this tominous bird of tyore,
What this grim, ungainly, +ghastly, +gaunt, and ominous bird
of yore
Meant, in croaking'.'Nevermore."
13. Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burn'd into my bosom's +core,
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining,
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight +gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamplight gloating o'er,
She shall press, ah, Nevermore!
14. Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer,                                      [floor;
Swung by angels, whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee, by these angels
he hath sent thee
Respite-respite, and +nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore I
Quaff, 0, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"
Quoth the raven, " Nevermore."
15. "Prophet,'" cried I, "thing of evil, prophet still, if bird or
devil,
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest toss'd thee here
ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted,
On this home by honor haunted-tell me truly, I implore,
Is there, is there balm in Gilead, tell me, tell me, I implore,"
Quoth the raven, " Nevermore."
16. " Prophet," said I, "thing of evil, prophet still, if bird or devil,
By that heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,
Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aiden,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore,
Clasp a rare and +radiant maiden, whom the angels name
Lenore,"
Quoth the raven, " Nevermore."
17. "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shriek'd
upstarting;
Get thee back into the tempest, and the night's Plutonian
shore;
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath
spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken? quit the bust above my door I
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off
my door."
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."
18. And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,
On the tpallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light, o'er him streaming, throws his shadow on
the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow, that lies floating on the
floor,
Sllall be lifted, Nevermore ICXLIII. - DARKNESS.  V
FROM BYRON.
1. I HAD a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was textinguish'd, and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
+Rayless and pathless, and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came, and went, and came, and brought no day,
And men forgot their passions, in the dread
Of this their desolation; and all hearts
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light.
2. And they did live by watch-fires; and the thrones,
The palaces of crown-ed kings, the huts,
The thabitations of all things which dwell,
Were burnt for tbeacons; cities were tconsumed,
And men were gather'd round their blazing homes
To look once more into each other's face;
Happy were those who dwelt within the eye
Of the +volcanoes and their mountain torch.
3. A fearful hope was all the world contain'd;
Forests were set on fire; but, hour by hour,
They fell and faded, and the crackling trunks
Extinguish'd with a crash; and all was black.
The brows of men, by the +unearthly light,
Wore an unearthly +aspect, as by fits
The flashes fell upon them; some lay down,
And hid their eyes, and wept; and some did rest
Their chins upon their clinch-ed hands, and smiled;
And others hurried to and fro, and fed
Their funeral piles with +fuei, and look'd up
With mad tdisquietude on the dull sky,
The +pall of a past world; and then again,
With curses cast them down upon the dust,
And gnash'd their teeth, and howl'd.
4.        The wild birds shriek'd,
And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,
And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
Came, tame and +tremulous; and vipers crawl'd
And twined themselves among the multitude,
Hissing, but stingless: they were slain for food;
And War, which for a moment was no more,
Did *glut himself again; a meal was boughtWith blood, and each sat sullenly apart,
Gorging himself in gloom; no love was left;
All earth was but one thought, and that was death,
Immediate'and +inglorious; and the pang
Of famine fed upon all entrails; men
Died, and their bones were +tombless as their flesh.
5. The tmeager by the meager were devour'd;
Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one,
And he was faithful to a tcorse, and kept
The birds, and beasts, and famish'd men at bay,
Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead
Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,
But with a *piteous and perpetual moan,
And a quick, desolate cry, licking the hand
Which answer'd not with a +caress, he died.
6. The crowd was famish'd by degrees: but two
Of an tenormous city did survive,
And they were enemies; they met beside
The dying embers of an altar-place,
Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things
For an unholy usage: they raked up,
And, shivering, scraped with their cold, skeleton hands,
The feeble ashes, and they made a flame
Which was a +mockery; then, they lifted up
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and belheld
Each other's aspects; saw, and shriek'd, and died:
Even of their mutual hideousness they died,
Unknowing who he was, upon whose brow
Famine had written Fiend.
7.        The world was void;
The populous and the powerful was a lump,
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless;
A lump of death, a +chaos of hard clay.
The rivers, lakes, and ocean, all stood still,
And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths;
Ships, sailorless, lay rotting on the sea,
And their masts fell down piecemeal; as they dropp'd,
They slept on the 4abyss without a +surge.
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave;
TRe moon, their mistress, had expired before;
The winds were wither'd in the +stagnant air,
And the clouds perish'd. Darkness had no need
Of aid from them. She was the tuniverse.NEW SIXTH READER.
CXLIV. -PRINCE HENRY AND FALSTAFF
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
PRINCE HENRY and POINS, in a bac]k room, in a tavern.
Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO.
Poins. Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?.Falstaff. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance
too! marry and amen! Give me a cup of tsack, boy. Ere I
lead this life long, I'11 sew nether-socks, and mend them, and
foot them, too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of
sack, rogue. Is there no virtue textant?. [He drinks, and then
continues.]  You rogue, here's lime in this sack: there's
nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man: yet a
coward is worse than a cup of sack, with lime in it; a villainous coward. Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt: if
manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the
earth, then am I a shotten herring. There live n6t three good
men unhanged, in England; and one of them is fat and grows
old; a bad world, I say! I would I were a weaver; I could
sing psalms, or anything; a plague of-all cowards, I say
still.
Prince Henry. How now, twool-sack?  What mutter you?
Fal. Thou art a king's son. Now, if I do not beat thee
out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese, I'11 never wear
hair on my face more. You, prince of Wales!
P. Henry. Why, you base-born dog! What's the matter?
Fal. Are you not a coward?  Answer me to that; and
Poins there?                                       [thee.
Poins. Ye fat braggart, an ye call me coward, I'11 stab
Fal. I call thee coward?  I'll see thee tgibbeted, ere I
call thee coward: but I would give a thousand pounds I could
run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough in the
shoulders, you care not who sees your back: call you that
backing of your friends?  A plague upon such backing!
Give me them that will face me. Give me a. cup of sack. I
am rogue, if I have drunk to-day.
P. Henry. 0 villain! thy lips are scarce wiped, since thou
drank'st last.Fal. All's one for that. A plague of all cowards, still
say I.                                       [ He drin7s.
P. Henry. What's the matter?
Fal. What's the matter! There be four of us here have
ta'en a thousand pounds this morning.
P. Henry. Where is it, Jack? where is it?
Fal. Where is it? Taken from us it is; a hundred upon
poor four of us..P. Henry. What! a hundred, man?
Fal. I am a rogue, if I were not at half sword with a dozen
of them, for two hours together. I have'scaped by miracle.
I am eight times thrust through the tdoublet; four, through
the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword
hacked like a hand-saw; look here: [shows his sword.]  I
never dealt better since I was a man; all would not do. A
plague of all cowards! Let them speak; [pointing to GADsHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO] if they speak more or less than
truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
P. Henry. Speak, sirs; how was it?
Gadshill. We four, sat upon some dozenFal. Sixteen, at least, my lord.
Gad. And bound them.
Peto. No, no, they were not bound.
Fal. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or
I am a Jew, else-an Ebrew Jew.                 [upon usGad. As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set
Fal. And unbound the rest; and then come in the other.
P. Henry. What! fought ye with them all?
Fal. All?  I know not what ye call all; but if I fought
not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if there were
not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then I am no
two legged creature.
Poins. Pray heaven, you have not murdered some of them.
Fal. Nqy, that's past praying for; for I have -peppered
two of them; two I am sure I have paid; two rogues in +buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in
my face, and call me a horse. Thou knowest my old ward;
[He draws his sword, and stands as if about to fight,] here I
lay, and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let
drive at me
31P. Henry. What! four?  Thou saidst but two even now.
Fal. Four, Hal; I told thee four.
Poins. Ay, ay, he said four.
Fal. These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me.
I made no more ado, but took all their seven points on my
+target, thus.
P. HEenry. Seven? Why, there were but four, even now.
Fal. In buckram?
Poins. Ay, four in buckram suits.
Fal. Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
P. HEenry.  Prithee, let him alone, we shall have more
+anon.
Fal. Dost thou hear me, Hal?
P. Henry. Ay, and mark thee, too, Jack.
Fal. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
men in buckram, that I told thee ofP. Henry. So, two more already.
Fal. Their points being broken, began to give me ground;
but I followed me close, came in foot and hand; and, with
a thought, seven of the eleven I paid.
P. Henry. 0, monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out
of two!
Fal. But three knaves, in Kendal green, came at my
back, and let drive at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou
couldst not see thy hand.
P. Henry. These lies are like the father of them; gross
as a mountain, open, +palpable. Why, thou clay-brained,
knotty-pated fool; thou greasy tallow-keech--
Fal. What! Art thou mad? Art thou mad?  Is not
the truth the truth?
P. Henry. Why, how couldst thou know these men in
Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
hand? Come, tell us your reason. What say'st thou to this  
Poins. Come, your reason, Jack; your reason.
Fal. What, upon compulsion? No, were I at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on
tcompulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion? If reasons
were as plenty as blackberries, I would give no man a reason
on compulsion.
P. Henry. I'11 no longer be guilty of this sin: this +tan363
guine coward, this horse-back-breaker, this huge hill of
fleshFal. Away! you +starveling, you eel-skin, you dried
neat's tongue, you stock-fish--O for breath to utter what is
like thee!--you tailor's yard, you sheath, you bow-case,
you--
P. Henry. Well, breathe awhile, and then to't again; and
when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons hear me
speak but this.
Poins. Mark, Jack.
P. Henry. We two, saw you four set on four; you bound
them, and were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how
plain a tale shall put you down. Then did we two, set on
you four, and with a word out-faced you from your prize, and
have it; yea, and can show it to you, here in the house: and,
Falstaff, you carried yourself away as nimbly, with as quick
tdexterity, and roared for mercy, and still ran and roared, as
ever I heard a calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight. What trick,
what +device, what starting-hole canst thou now find out to
hide thee from this open and apparent shame?
Poins. Come, let's hear, Jack. What trick hast thou
now?
Fal. Why, I knew ye, as well as he that made ye. Why,
hear ye, my masters: was it for me to kill the +heir-apparent?
Should I turn upon the true prince?  Why, thou knowest, I
am as valiant as Hercules; but beware +instinct; the lion
will not touch the true prince; tinstinct is a great matter; I
was a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself
and thee, during my life; I for a valiant lion, and thou for a
true prince. But, lads, I am glad you have the money.
Hostess, clap to the doors.  Watch to-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold; all the titles of
good fellowship come to you!  What, shall we be merry!
Shall we have a play +extempore?

CXLV. - THE QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS.
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
Cassius. That you have wrong'd me, doth appear in this;
You have condemn'd and +noted Lucius Pella,
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, were slighted of.
Brutus. You wrong'd yourself, to write in such a case.
Cas. In such a time as this, it is not meet
That every nice offense should bear its +comment.
Bru. Yet let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemii'd to have an +itching palm;
To sell and +mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.
Cas. I an itching palm?
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
Brm  The name of Cassius honors this t+corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide its head.
Cas. Chastisement!
Bru. Remember March, the Ides of March remember!
Did not great Julius bleed for justices' sake!
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man in all this world
But for supporting robbers; shall we now
tContaminate our fingers with base bribes?
And sell the mighty space of our large honors,
For so much trash as may be grasp'd thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
Cas. Brutus, bay not me,
I'1 not endure it: you forget yourself
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions.
Bru. Go to; you're not, Cassius.
Cas. I am.
Bru. I say, you are not.
Cas. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
Bruw. Away, slight man I
Cas. Is't possible?Bru. Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash +choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
Cas. 0 ye gods! ye gods! must I endure all this?
Brt. All this? Ay, more; fret till your proud heart break;
Go, show your slaves how -choleric you are,
And make your +bondmen tremble. Must I 1-budge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your ftesty humor? By the gods,
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I'11 use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.
Cas. Is it come to this?
Bru. You say you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so; make your tvaunting true,
And it shall please me well; for mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
Cas. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus;
I said an elder soldier, not a better:
Did I say better?
Bru. If you did, I care not.
Cas. When Caesar lived, he durst not so have moved me.
Bru. Peace, peace; you durst not so have tempted him.
Gas. I durst not I
Bru. No.
Cas. What?  Durst not tempt him?
Bru. For your life, you durst not.
Cas. Do not presume too much upon my love;
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
Bru. You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,
That they pass by me as the idle wind,
Which I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;
For I can raise no money by vile means:
Ye Gods! I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for +drachmas, than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash,
By any tindirection. I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?

CXLVII.- IMPEACHMENT OF WARREN HASTINGS.
WARREN HASTINGS was a Governor of the British possessions in
India, and was impeached for tmaladministration.
EDMUND BURKE, who, as attorney-general for the crown, conducted
the prosecution of Warren Hastings, was born in 1730. As an orator,
politician, and author, he stood high among his cotemporaries. He
died in 1797.
1. THE place in which the fimpeachment of Warren Hastings was conducted, was worthy of such a trial. It was the
great hall of William Rufus; the hall, which had resounded
with tacclamations, at the inauguration of thirty kings; the
hall, which had witnessed the just sentence of Bacon, and the
just tabsolution of Somers; the hall, where the eloquence of
Stafford had for a moment awed and melted a victorious party
inflamed with just resentment; the hall, where Charles had
+confronted the High Court of Justice, with the placid courage
which half redeemed his fame.
2. Neither military nor civil pomp was wanting. The
avenues were lined with grenadiers.  The streets were kept
clear by cavalry. The peers, robed in gold and ermine, were
marshaled by heralds. The judges, in their tvestments of
state, attended to give advice on points of law. The long
galleries were crowded by such an audience as has rarely
excited the fears or emulation of an orator.  There, were
gathered together, from all points of a great, free, enlightened,
and prosperous realm, grace and female loveliness, wit, and
learning, the representatives of every science and every art.
3. There, were seated around the queen, the fair-haired,
young daughters of the house of Brunswick.  There, the
+embassadors of great kings and commonwealths gazed with
admiration on a spectacle which no other country in the world
could present. There, Siddons,* in the pride of her majestic
beauty, looked with emotion on a scene +surpassing all the
imitations of the stage. There, Gibbon, the historian of the
Roman Empire, thought of the days when Cicero pleaded the
cause of Sicily against Verres; and when, before a senate
which had some show of freedom, Tacitus thundered against
*A celebrated actress.the oppressor of Africa; and there too, were seen, side by
side, the greatest painter and the greatest scholar of the age;
for the spectacle had tallured Reynolds from his easel, and
Parr, from his study.
4. The tsergeants made tproclamation. Hastings advanced
to the bar, and bent his knee. The culprit was indeed not
unworthy of that great presence. He had ruled an extensive and populous country; had made laws and treaties; had
sent forth armies; had set up, and pulled down princes; and
in his high place he had so borne himself, that all had feared
him, that most had loved him, and that hatred itself could
deny him no title to glory, except virtue. A person, small
and temaciated, yet deriving dignity from a carriage which,
while it indicated +deference to the court, indicated, also.
habitual self-possession and self-respect; a high and intellectual forehead; a brow, pensive, but not gloomy; a mouth of
tinflexible decision; a face, pale and worn, but on which a
great and well-balanced mind was legibly written: such
formed the aspect with which the great pro-consul presented
himself to his judges.
5. The charges, and the answers of Hastings, were first
read.  This +ceremony occupied two whole days.  On the
third, Burke rose. Four sittings of the court were occupied
by his opening speech, which was intended to be a general
introduction to all the charges. With an +exuberance of
thought and a splendor of diction, which more than satisfied
the highly-raised expectations of the audience, he described
the character and institutions of the natives of India; recounted the circumstances in which the Asiatic Empire of
Britain had originated; and set forth the Constitution of the
Company and of the English Presidencies.
6. Having thus attempted to communicate to his hearers
an idea of eastern society, as vivid as that which existed in
his own mind, he proceeded to tarraign the administration of
Hastings, as systematically conducted in defiance of morality
and public law. The energy and pathos of the great orator
textorted expressions of unwonted admiration from all; and,
for a moment, seemed to pierce even the resolute heart of the
defendant. The ladies.in the galleries, unaccustomed to such
displays of eloquence, excited by the solemnity of the occaNEW SIXTH READER.
sion, and perhaps not unwilling to display their taste andsensibility, were in a state of incontrollable emotion. Handkerchiefs were pulled out; smelling-bottles were handed
round; thysterical sobs and screams were heard, and some
were even carried out in fits.
7. At length, the orator concluded. Raising his voice, till
the old arches of Irish oak resounded--" Therefore," said he,
"hath it in all confidence been ordered by the Commons of
Great Britain, that I timpeach Warren Hastings of high
crimes and misdemeanors. I impeach him in the name of the
Commons House of Parliament, whose trust he has betrayed.
I impeach him in the name of the English nation, whose
ancient honor he has sullied. I impeach him in the name of
the people of India, whose rights he has trodden under foot,
and whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly, in
the name of human nature itself, in the name of both sexes,
in the name of every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all."

FROM SHAKSPEARE.
King John. Come hither, Hubert, O, my gentle Huberti
We owe thee much; within this wall of flesh
There is a soul counts thee her +creditor,
And with advantage means to pay thy love:And my good friend, thy +voluntary oath
Lives in this bosom, dearly cherish'd.. Give me thy hand. I had a thing to sayBut I will fit it with some better time.
In truth, good Hubert, I am almost ashamed
To say what great respect I have for thee.
Hubert. I am much bounden to your majesty.
K. John. Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet;
But thou shalt have; and, creep time ne'er so slow,
Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
I had a thing to say,-but let it go:
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
Is all too wanton, and too full of tgauds,
To give me +audience. If the midnightbell
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,373
Sound one unto the drowsy race of night;
If this same were a church-yard where we stand,
And thou possess-ed with a thousand wrongs:
Or if that surly spirit, melanclloly,
IIad baked thy blood and made it heavy, thick;
(Which, else, runs trickling up and down the veins,
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's.eyes,
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
A passion hateful to my purposes;)
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
Without a tongue, using +conceit alone,
Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;
Then, in +despite of tbrooded, watchful day,
I would into this bosom pour my thought.
But, ah, I will not. Yet I love thee well;
And, by my +troth, I think thou lov'st me well.
Hub. So well, that what you bid me undertake,
Though that my death were t+adjunct to my act,
I'd do it.
K John. Do I not know thou wouldst?
Good Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
On yon young boy. I'll tell thee what, my friend,
He is a very serpent in my way;
And, wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth trace,
He lies before me. Dost thou understand me P?
Thou art his keeper.

That he shall not offend your majesty
K. John. Death.
Hub. My lord?

CXLIX. - THE REMORSE OF KING JOHN.
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
Hubert. My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night:
Four fix'd; and the fifth did whirl about
The other four, in wonderous motion.NEW SIXTH READER.
King John. Five moons?
Hub.  Old men and +beldams in the streets
Do prophesy on it +dangerously:
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks, doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
While he, that hears, makes fearful action
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
The while his iron did on the anvil cool,
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
Standing on slippers, (which his nimble haste
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,)
Told of many thousand warlike French,
That were tembattled and rank'd in Kent;
Another lean, unwash'd tartificer,
Cuts off his tale, and talks of Arthur's death.
K. John. Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
Thy hand hath murder'd him. I had mighty cause
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
Hub. HIad none, my lord? Why, did you not provoke me?
K. John. It is the curse of Kings, to be attended
By slaves that take their humors for a twarrant
To break within the bloody house of life;
And on the winking of authority,
To understand a law; to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty, when, perchance, it frowns
More upon humor than advised +respect.
Hub. Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
K. John. Oh, when the last account'twixt heaven and earth
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation!
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds,
Makes ill deeds done! Hadst not thou been by,
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
tQuoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
This murder had not come into mv mind:
But, taking note of thy +abhorr-ed +aspect,
Finding thee fit for bloody +villainy,
Apt, +liable to be employ'd in danger,
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death375
And thou, to be endear-ed to a king,
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
Hub.   My lord.
K. John. Hadst thou but shook thy head, or made a pause,
When I spoke darkly of what I proposed;
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
And bid me tell my tale in express words;
Deep shame had made me dumb, made me break off,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.
But thou didst understand me by my signs,
And didst in signs again +parley with sin;
Yea, without stop didst let thy heart consent,
And, consequently, thy rude hand to act
The deed, which both our tongues hold vile to name:
Out of my sight, and never see me more!
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers;
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
This kingdom, this tconfine of blood and breath,
Hostility and civil tumult reign
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
IHub. Arm you against your other enemies,
I'11 make a peace between your soul and you.
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
Within this bosom never enter'd yet
The dreadful notion of a murderous thought,
And you have slander'd nature in my form;
Which, however rude texteriorly,
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
K. John.' Doth Arthur live? Oh, haste thee to the peers,
Throw this report on their +incensed rage,
And make them tame to their obedience!
Forgive the tcomment that my passion made
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
And foul, timaginary eyes of blood
Presented thee more thideous than thou art.
O, answer not; but to my closet bring
The angry lords, with all expedient haste;

CLI - THE NATURAL AND MORAL WORLDS.
FROM GRIMKE.
1. MAN, the noblest work of God in this lower world,
walks abroad through its +labyrinths of grandeur and beauty,
amid countless manifestations of creative power and providential wisdom. He acknowledges, in all that he beholds,
the might that called them into being; the skill which perfected the harmony of the parts, and the benevolence which
tconsecrated all to the glory of God and the welfare of his
fellow creatures. He stands entranced on the peak of +tEtna,
or tTeneriffe, or tMontserrat, and looks down upon the far
distant ocean, silent to his ear, and tranquil to his eye, amid
the rushing of tempestuous winds, and the fierce conflict of
stormy billows. He sits *enraptured on the mountain summit, and beholds, as far as the eye can reach, a forest robe,
flowing in all the varieties of graceful tundulations, over
declivity after declivity, as though the tfabulous river of the
skies were pouring its azure waves over all the landscape.
2. He hangs over the precipice, and gazes with awful delight on the savage glen, rent open as it were, by the earthquake, and black with lightning-shattered rocks; its only
music the echoing thunder, the scream of the lonely eagle,
and the ttumultuous waters of the mountain torrent. He
reclines, in pensive mood, on the hill-top, and sees around
and beneath him, all the tluxuriant beauties of field and
meadow, of olive yard and vineyard, of wandering stream and
grove-encircled lake.
3. He descends to the plain, and amid waving harvests, verdant +avenues, and luxuriant orchards, sees between garden
and grass-plat, the farm-house, embosomed in tcopse-wood or
"tall +ancestral trees."  He walks through the valley, fenced
in by barrier cliffs, to contemplate, with mild enthusiasm, its
scenes of pastoral beauty; the cottage and its blossomed arbor, the shepherd and his SAock, the clumps of oaks or the
solitary willow. He enters the caverns buried far beneath the
surface, and is struck with amazement at the grandeur and
magnificence of a tsubterranean palace, hewn out as it were,
by the power of the tGenii, and tdecorated by the taste of
Armida, or of the Queen of the Fairies.
4. Such is the natural world; and such, for the most part,NEW SIXTH READER.
has it ever been, since men began to subdue the wilderness,
to scatter the ornaments of civilization amid the rural scenery
of nature, and to plant the lily on the margin of the deep,
the village on the hillside, and tmartial tbattlements in the
+defiles of the mountains. Such has been the natural world,
whether beheld by the eye of savage or barbarian, of the
civilized or the refined. Such has it been, for the most part,
whether contemplated by the harpers of Greece, the bards of
Northern Europe, or the tvoluptuous minstrels of the Troubadour age. Such it was, when its beauties, like scattered
stars, beamed on the page of classic +lore; and such, when its
" sunshine of picture" poured a flood of meridian splendor on
modern literature. Such is the natural world to the ancient
and the modern, the pagan and the Christian.
5. Admirable as the natural world is for its sublimity and
beauty, who would compare it, even for an instant, with the
sublimity and beauty of the moral world?  Is not the soul,
with its glorious destiny and its capacities for eternal happiness, more awful and majestic than the boundless Pacific or
the tinterminable Andes? Is not the mind, with its thoughts
that wander through eternity, and its wealth of intellectual
power, an object of more intense interest, than forest, or +cataract, or precipice?  And the heart, so eloquent in the depth,
purity, and +pathos of its affections, can the richest scenery
of hill and dale, can the melody of breeze, and brook, and
bird, rival it in loveliness?
6. The same God is the author of the invisible and visible
world. The moral grandeur and beauty of the world of man,
are equally the production of his wisdom and goodness, with
the fair, the sublime, the wonderful in the physical creation.
What, indeed, are these, but the outward manifestations of
his might, skill, and benevolence? What are they but a glorious volume, forever speaking to the eye and ear of man, in
the language of sight and sound, the praises of its author?
And what are those but images, faint and imperfect as they
are, of his own +incomprehensible tattributes? What are
they, the soul, the mind, the heart of an immortal being, but
the temple of the holy Spirit; the dwelling place of him
whom the Heaven of Heavens can not contain, who inhabiteth
eternity?  How then can we compare, even for a moment,
the world of nature with the world of man?CLII. - THE PLEASANT RAIN.

By fits it plashing falls
On +twangling leaf and dimpling +pool;
How sweet its warning calls!

High slopes and verdant +meads;
The queenly elms and princely oaks,

And drooping shrubs look gay;
The bubbling brook, with gladlier song,

All things of earth, the grateful things,
Put on their robes of cheer;
They hear the sound of the warning burst,
And know the rain is near.
3. It comes! it comes! the pleasant rain!
I drink its cooler bieath;
It is rich with sighs of fainting flowers,
And roses' tfragrant death;
It hath kiss'd the tomb of the lily pale,
The beds where violets die;
And it bears their life on its living wings;
I feel it wandering by.
4. And yet it comes! The lightning's flash
Hath torn the lowering cloud!
With a distant roar and a nearer crash,
Out bursts the thunder loud.
It comes, with the rush of a god's descent,
On the hush'd and trembling earth,
To visit the tshrines of the hallow'd groves,
Where a poet's soul had birth.
5. With a rush, as of a thousand steeds,
Is its swift and glad descent;
Beneath the weight of its passing tread,
The tconscious groves are bent;
Its heavy tread, it is lighter now,
And yet, it passeth on;
And now it is up, with a sudden lift,
The pleasant rain hath gone.

6. The pleasant rain! the pleasant rain 1
It hath pass'd above the earth:
I see the smile of the opening cloud,
Like the parted lips of mirth.
The golden joy is spreading wide
Along the blushing west,
And the happy earth gives back her smiles,
Like the flow of a grateful breast.
7. As a blessing sinks in a grateful heart,
That knoweth all its need,
So came the good of the pleasant rain,
O'er hill and verdant +mead.
It shall breathe this truth on the human ear,
In hall and +cotter's home,
That to bring the gift of a bounteous heaven,
The pleasant rain hath come.
CLIII.- THE SNOW-FLAKE.
FROM Miss GOULD.
HANRAH F. GOULD was born in Lancashire, Vermont, in 1792. Her poems
are full of beauty and sprightliness, and are always instructive.
IRIS; the rainbow.
1. " Now if I fall, will it be my lot
To be cast in some low and cruel spot?
To melt or sink unseen or forgot?
And then will my course be ended?"'T was thus a feathery Snow-Flake said,
As down through the tmeasureless space it stray'd,
Or, as half by tdalliance, half afraid,
It seem'd in mid air suspended.
2. "Oh, no," said the Earth, " thou shalt not lie,
Neglected and lone, on my lap to die,
Thou fine and delicate child of the sky:
For thou wilt be safe in my keeping;
But then, I must give thee a lovelier form;
Thou'lt not be a part of the wintry storm,
But revive when the sunbeams are yellow and warm,
And flowers from my bosom are peeping.
3. "And then thou shalt have thy choice to be
Restored in the lily that decks the tlea,In the +jessamine bloom, the tanemone,
Or aught of thy spotless whiteness:
To melt and be cast in a glittering bead,
With the pearls that night scatters o'er the mead,
In the cup where the bee and the fire-fly feed,
Regaining thy dazzling brightness:
4. "To wake, and be rais'd from thy transient sleep,
Where Viola's mild blue eye shall weep;
In a tremulous tear or a diamond, leap
In a drop from the unlock'd fountain;
Or leaving the valley, the meadow, and heath,
The streamlet, the flowers, and all beneath,
To go and be worn in the silvery wreath,

To shine in the Iris, I'11 let thee arise,
And appear in the many and glorious dyes,
A pencil of sunbeams is blending.
But true, fair thing, as my name is Earth,
I'11 give thee a new and tvernal birth,

And never regret descending."
6. "Then I will drop," said the trusting Flake;
" But bear it in mind, that the choice I make,
Is not in the flowers or the dew to awake,
Nor the mist that shall pass with the morning:
For things of thyself, they expire with thee;
But those that are lent from on high, like me,
They rise, and will live, from thy dust set free,
To the regions above returning.
7. "And if true to thy word, and just thou art,
Like the spirit that dwells in the holiest heart,
+Unsullied by thee, thou wilt let me depart,
And return to my native heaven;
For I would be placed in the beautiful bow
From time to time in thy sight to glow,
So thou may'st remember the flake of Snow,
By the promise that God hath given."CLIV.- THE TEACHER AND SICK SCHOLAR.
FROM DICKENS.
1. SHORTLY after the schoolmaster had arranged the forms
and taken his seat behind his desk, a small white-headed boy
with a sun-burnt face appeared at the door, and stopping
there to make a frustic bow, came in and took his seat upon
one of the forms. He then put an open book, astonishingly
tdog's-eared, upon his knees, and thrusting his hands into
his pockets, began counting the marbles with which they
were filled; displaying, in the expression of his face, a remarkable tcapacity of totally tabstracting his mind from the
spelling on which his eyes were fixed.
2. Soon afterward, another white-headed little boy came
straggling in, and after him, a red-headed lad, and then, one
with a flaxen tpoll, until the forms were occupied by a dozen
boys, or thereabouts, with heads of every color but gray,
and +ranging in their ages from four years old to fourteen
years or more; for the legs of the youngest were a long way
from the fioor, when he sat upon the form; and the eldest
was a heavy, good-tempered fellow, about half a head taller
than the schoolmaster.
3. At the top of the first form-the post of honor in the
school-was the vacant place of the little sick scholar; and,
at the head of the row of pegs, on which those who wore hats
or caps were wont to hang them, one was empty. No boy attempted to violate the tsanctity of seat or peg, but many a one
looked from the empty spaces to the schoolmaster, and whispered to his idle neighbor, behind his hand.
4. Then began the hum of tconning over lessons and
getting them by heart, the whispered jest and stealthy game,
and all the noise and drawl of school; and in the midst of
the din sat the poor schoolmaster, vainly attempting to fix his
mind upon the duties of the day, and to forget his little sick
friend. But the +tedium of his office reminded him more
strongly of the willing scholar, and his thoughts weA:,
+rambling from his pupils-it was plain.
5. None knew this better than the idlest boys, who,
bolder with +impunity, waxed louder and more daring;:: py385
ing "odd or even" under the master's eye; eating apples
openly and without rebuke; pinching each other in sport or
tinalice, without the least reserve; and cutting their tinitials
in the very legs of his desk. The puzzled dunce, who stood
beside it to say his lesson "off the book," looked no longer
at the ceiling for forgotten words, but drew closer to the master's elbow, and boldly cast his eye upon the page; the wag
of the little troop squinted and made tgrimaces (at the smal--
lest boy, of course,) holding no book before his face, and his
approving companions knew no constraint in their delight.
If the master did chance to rouse himself, and seem alive
to what was going on, the noise subsided for a moment, and
no eye met his, but wore a studious and deeply humble look;
but the instant he trelapsed again, it broke out afresh, and
ten times louder than before.
6. Oh! how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside, and how they looked at the open door and window, as if
they half +meditated rushing violently out, plunging into
the woods, and being wild boys and savages from that time
forth. What rebellious thoughts of the cool river, and some
shady bathing-place, beneath willow trees with branches
dipping in the water, kept tempting and urging that sturdy
boy, who, with his shirt-collar unbuttoned, and flung back as
far as it could go, sat fanning his flushed face with a spellingbook, wishing himself a whale, or a minnow, or a fly, or any
thing but a boy at school, on that hot, broiling day.
7. Heat! ask that other boy, whose seat being nearest to
the door, gave him topportunities of gliding out into the
garden, and driving his companions to madness, by dipping
his face into the bucket of the well, and then rolling on the
grass,-ask him if there was ever such a day as that, when
even the bees were diving deep down into the cups of the
flowers, and stopping there, as if they had made up their
minds to retire from business, and be manufacturers of honey
no more. The day was made for laziness, and lying on one's
back in green places, and staring at the sky, till its brightness forced the gazer to shut his eyes and go to sleep. And
was this a time to be +poring over musty books in a dark
room, slighted by the very sun itself? Monstrous!

quiet time; for the master would come and look over the
writer's.shoulder, and mildly tell him to observe how such
a letter was turned up, in such a copy on the wall, which
had been written by their sick companion, and bid him take
it as a +model.  Then he would stop and tell them what
the sick child had said last night, and how he had longed
to be among them once again; and such was the.poor
schoolmaster's gentle and affectionate manner, that the boys
seemed quite +remorseful that they had worried him so
much, and were absolutely quiet; eating no apples, cutting
no names, and making no tgrimaces for full two minutes
afterward.
9.' I think, boys," said the schoolmaster, when the clock
struck twelve, "that I shall give you an extra half-holiday
this afternoon." At this intelligence, the boys, led on and
headed by the tall boy, raised a great shout, in the midst of
which the master was seen to speak, but could not be heard.
As he held up his hand, however, in token of his wish that
they should be silent, they were *considerate enough to leave
off, as soon as the longest-winded among them were quite
out of breath.  "'You must promise me, first," said the
schoolmaster, "that you'11 not be noisy, or, at least, if you
are, that you'll go away first, out of the village, I mean.
I'm  sure you wouldn't disturb your old playmate and
companion."
10. There was a general murmur (and perhaps a very
sincere one, for they were but boys,) in the negative; and
the tall boy, perhaps as sincerely as any of them, called
those about him to witness, that he had only shouted in a
whisper. "Then pray do n'.t forget, there's my dear scholars," said the schoolmaster, "what I have asked you, and do
it as a favor to me. Be as happy as you can, and do n't
be unmindful that you are blessed with health. Good by, all."
11. " Thank'ee, sir" and " Good-by, sir," were said a great
many times in a great variety of voices, and the boys went
out very slowly and softly. But there was the sun shining,
and there were birds singing, as the sun only shines, and
the birds only sing, on holidays and half-holidays; there
were the trees waving to all free boys to climb, and nestle
among their leafy branches; the hay, entreating them  to387
come and scatter it to the pure air; the green corn, gently
beckoining toward wood;and stream; the smooth ground,
rendered smoother still by *blending lights and shadows,
inviting to runs and leaps, and long walks, nobody knows
whither. It was more than boy could bear, and with a joyous whoop, the whole cluster took to their heels, -and spread
themselves about, shouting and laughing as they went. "'T is
natural, thank Heaven! " said the poor schoolmaster, looking after them: " I am very glad they did n't mind me."
12. Toward night, the schoolmaster walked over to the
cottage where his little friend lay sick.  Knocking gently
at the cottage door, it was opened without loss of time. He
entered a room where a group of women were gathered about
one who was wringing her hands and crying bitterly.  " Oh
dame!" said the schoolmaster, drawing near her chair, " is
-it so bad as this?"  Without replying, she pointed to
another room, which the schoolmaster immediately entered;
and there lay his little friend, half-dressed, stretched upon
a bed.
13. He was a very young boy; quite a little child. His
hair still hung in curls about his face, and his eyes were
very bright; but their light was of heaven, not of earth.
The schoolmaster took a seat beside him, and stooping over
the pillow, whispered his name. The boy sprung up, stroked
his face with his hand, and threw his wasted arms around
his neck, crying, that he was his dear, kind friend.  "1
hope I always was. I meant to be, God knows," said the
poor schoolmaster. "You remember my garden, Henry?"
whispered the old man, anxious to rouse him, for a dullness seemed gathering upon the child, "and how pleasant
it used to be in the. evening-time? You must make haste
to visit it again, for I think the very flowers have missed you,
and are less gay than they used to be. You will come soon,
very soon now, won't you?"
14. The boy smiled faintly-so very, very faintly-and
put his hand upon his friend's gray head. He moved his
lips too, but no voice came from them, no, not a sound. In
the silence that tensued, the hum of distant voices borne
upon the evening air, came floating through the open window.
"What's that?" said the sick child, opening his eyes. "TheNEW  SIXTH READER.
boys at play, upon the green." He took a handkerchief from
his pillow, and tried to wave it above his head. But the
feeble arm dropped powerless down. "Shall I do it?" said
the schoolmaster.'Please wave it at the window," was the
faint reply. "Tie it to the tlattice.  Some of them may
see it there. Perhaps they'll think of me, and look this
way."
15. He raised his head and glanced from the tfluttering
+signal to his idle bat, that lay, with slate, and book, and
other boyish property, upon the table in the room.  And
then he laid him softly down once more; and again clasped
his little arms around the old man's neck. The two old
friends and companions--for such they were, though they
were man and child-held each other in a long embrace,
and then the little scholar turned his face to the wall and
fell asleep.
16. The poor schoolmaster sat in the same place, holding
the small, cold hand in his, and chafing it. It was but the
hand of a dead child. He felt that; and yet he chafed it
still, and could not lay it down.
CLV. - THE WIDOW AND HER SON.
FROM EDWARDS.
1. SHE said she was alone within the world;
How could she but be sad!
She whisper'd something of a lad,
With eyes of blue, and light hair sweetly curl'd;
But the grave had the child!
And yet his voice she heard,
When at the +lattice, calm and mild,
The mother in the twilight saw the vine-leaves stirr'd.
"Mother," it seem'd to say,
"I love thee;
When thou dost by the side of thy lone pillow pray,
My.spirit writes the words above thee;
Mother I watch o'er thee; I love thee!"
2. Where was the husband of the widowed thing,
That +seraph's earthly sire?389
A soldier dares a soldier's fire;
The murderous ball brought death upon its wing;
Beneath a foreign sky
He fell, in sunny Spain;
The wife, in silence, saw him die,
But the fond boy's blue eyes gave drops like sunny rain.
"Mother 1" the poor lad cried,
"He's dying!
We are close by thee, father, at thy bleeding side;
Dost thou not hear thy Arthur crying?
Mother I his lips are closed; he's dying I"
3. It was a stormy time, where the man fell,
And the youth shrunk and +pined;
+Consumption's worm his pulse +entwined;
" Prepare his shroud!" rang out the convent bell,
Yet through his pain he smiled,
To soothe a parent's grief;
Sad soul! she could not be tbeguiled;
She saw the bud would leave the guardian leaf!
"Mother!' he faintly said,
"Come near me;
Kiss me, and let me in my father's grave be laid;
I've pray'd that I might still be near thee;
Mother I I'11 come again and cheer thee."
CLVI. - THE LITTLE BROOK AND THE STAR.
1. ONCE upon a time, in the leafy +covert of a wild, woody
+dingle, there lived (for it was indeed, a thing of life) a certain little brook, that might have been the happiest creature
in the world, if it had but known when it was well-off, and
been content with the station assigned to it by an unerring
Providence.  But in that knowledge and that content, consists the true secret of happiness; and the silly little brook
never found out the mystery, until it was too late to profit
by it.
2. I can not say, positively, from what source the little
brook came; but it appeared to +well out from beneath the
hollow root of an old thorn; and, collecting together its +pellucid waters, so as to form a small pool within that knotty
treservoir it swelled +imperceptibly over its irregular +margin,and slipped away, unheard,-almost unseen,-among mossy
stones and entangling branches, No +emerald was ever so
green; never was velvet so soft, as the beautiful moss which
encircled that tiny lake; and it was gemmed and embroidered, too, by all flowers that love the shade; pale primroses
and nodding violets; +anemones, with their fair, downcast
heads; and starry clusters of forget-me-not, looking lovingly,
with their pale, tender eyes, into the bosom: of their native
rill.
3. The hawthorn's branches were +interwoven above, with
those of a holly; and a woodbine, climbing up the stem of
one tree, flung across to the other its tflexible arms, knotting
together the mingled foliage, with its rich clusters and elegant tfestoons, like a fair sister, growing up under the
guardianship of two beloved brothers, and, by her endearing
witchery, drawing together, in closer union, their already
united hearts.  Never was little brook so delightfully situated;
for its existence, though tsecluded, was neither monotonous
nor solitary. A thousand trifling incidents*(trifling, but not
uninteresting,) were perpetually varying the scene; and
innumerable living creatures, the gentlest and loveliest of the
+sylvan tribes, familiarly, haunted its retreat.
4. Beautiful, there, was every season with its changes! In
the year's fresh morning, delicious May or ripening June, if
a light breeze but stirred in the hawthorn tops, down on the
dimpling. water came a shower of milky, blossoms, loading
the air with fragrance as they tell.  Then, came the squirrel
with his mirthful antics.  Then, rustling through fern and
brushwood, stole the timid hare, half startled, as she slaked
her thirst at the still fountain, by the liquid: reflection of her
own large, +lustrous eyes.  There was no! lackl of music round
about. A song-thrush had his tdomicil hard by; and, even
at night, his mellow voice was heard, contending with a nightingale, in scarce unequal rivalry.  An-d other vocalists, innumerable, awoke those woodland echoes. Sweetest of all, the
low, ttremulous call of the ring-dove. floated, at intervals,
through the shivering tfoliage, the very soul of sound and
tenderness.
5. In winter, the glossy-green and tcoral: clusters of the.
holly, flung down their rich reflections: on the little pool, thenvisited through the leafless boughs with a gleam of more
perfect daylight; and a red-breast. which had built its nest,
and reared its young among the twisted roots of that old
tree, still hovered about his summer bower, still quenched his
thirst at the little brook, still sought his food on its mossy
banks; and, tuning his small pipe, when every other feathered throat, but his own, was mute, took up the eternal hymn
of gratitude, which began with the birth-day of Nature, and
shall only cease with her expiring breath. So, every season
brought but changes of pleasantness to that happy little
brook: and happier still it was,-or might have been,-in one
sweet and tender companionship, to which passing time and
revolving seasons brought no change.
6. True it was, no *unintercepted sunshine ever glittered
on its shaded waters; but, just above the spot where they
were gathered into that fairy fount, a small opening in the
toverarching foliage admitted, by day, a glimpse of the: blue
sky; and, by night, the mild, pale ray of a bright fixed star,
which looked down into the stilly water, with such tender
tradiance as beams from the eyes we love best, when they rest
upon us with an earnest gaze of serious tenderness. Forever,
and forever, when night came, the beautiful star still gazed
on its earth-born love, which seemed, if a wandering air but
skimmed its surface, to stir, as if with life, in *responsive
intercourse with its bright visitant.
7. Some malicious whispers went abroad, indeed, that the
+enamored: gaze of that radiant eye was not always exclusively
fixed on the little brook; that it had its toblique glances for
other favorites. But I take it, those rumors were altogether
tlibelous, mere rural +gossip, scandalous tittle-tattle, got up,
between two old, gray, +mousing owls, who went prowling
about and prying into. their neighbors' concerns, when they
ought to have been in their beds, at home. However that
may be-though I warrant the ki,nd creatures were too conscientious to leave the little brook in ignorance of their
candid tconjectures-it did not care one fig about the matter,
utterly disregarding every syllable they said. This. woufd
have been highly creditable to the little brook, if its light
mode of dismissing the subject had not been partly owing to.
the fengrossing influence of certain +new-fangled notions andNEW SIXTH READER.
desires, which, in an unhappy hour, had +insinuated themselves into its hitherto untroubled bosom.
8. Alas! that telementary, as well as human natures,
should be liable to tmoral tinfirmity! But that they are,
was strongly exemplified in the instance of our luckless little
brook.  You must know, that, notwithstanding the leafy
recess, in which it was so snugly located, was, to all inward
appearance, tsequestered as in the heart of a vast forest, in
point of fact, it only skirted the edge of an extensive plain, in
one part of which lay a large pond, to which herds of kine
and oxen came down to drink, morning and evening, and
wherein they might be seen standing motionless for hours
together, during the sultry summer noon; when the waveless
water, glowing like a fiery mirror under the meridian blaze,
reflected, with tmagical effect, the huge forms and varied
coloring of the tcongregated cattle, as well as those of a flock
of stately, milk-white geese, accustomed to swim upon its
bosom.
9. Now, it so chanced, that from the nook of which we
have spoken, encircled as it was by leafy walls, there opened,
precisely in the direction of the plain and the pond, a cunning
little peep-hole, which must have been tperforated by the
demon of mischief, and which no eye would ever have spied
out, save that of a tlynx or an idle person. Alas! our little
brook was an idle person; she had nothing in the world to
do from morning to night, and that is the root of all evil; so,
though she might have found useful occupation, (every body
can, if they seek it in right earnest,) she spent her whole time
in peering and prying about, till, one unlucky day, what
should she hit upon, but that identical peep-hole, through
which, as through a ttelescope, she discovered with unspeakable amazement the great pond, all glowing in the noon-day
sun; the herds of cattle and the flocks of geese, so brilliantly
redoubled on its broad mirror.
10. "My stars! " ejaculated the little brook, (little thought
she at that moment, of the one faithful star.)  " My stars!
what can all this be? It looks something like me, only a
thousand times as big. What can be shining so upon it? and
w'hat can those great creatures'be? Not hares, surely, though
they have legs and tails; but such tails! And those otlher393
white things, that float about, they can not be birds, for they
have no legs, and yet they seem to have feathers and wings.
What a life of ignorance have I led, huddled up in this poor,
little, dull place, visited only by a few, mean, +humdrum
creatures, and never suspecting that the world contained finer
things and grander company."
11. Till this unfortunate discovery, the little brook had
been well enough satisfied with her condition; contented with
the society of the beautiful and gentle creatures which frequented her retreat, and with the tender admiration of her
own "bright unchanging star." But now, there was an end
to all content, and no end to +garrulous discontent and endless curiosity. The latter, she soon found means to satisfy,
for the sky-lark brought her flaming accounts of the sun, at
whose court he pretended to be a frequent visitor; and the
-water-wagtail was dispatched to ascertain the precise nature
of those other mysterious objects, so bewildering to the
limited tfaculties of the curious little brook.
12. Back came the little messenger, mopping,* and mowing,* and wagging his tail with the most tfantastic airs of
conceited importance. "Well, what is it?" quoth my lady
brook. "Water upon my veracity," quoth Master Wagtail,
"monstrous piece of water, five hundred thousand million
times as big as your ladyship." "And what makes it so
bright and glowing, instead of my dull color?" quoth my
lady. "The sun, that shines full upon it," rejoins the +envoy.
"Oh! that glorious globe, the sky-lark talks of.  How
delightful it must be to enjoy his notice!  But what are
those fine creatures with legs, and those others with wings
and no legs?"  "Oh! those are cows, and oxen, and geese;
but you can not possibly +comprehend their natures, never
having seen any thing larger than a hare or wood-pigeon."
H' ow now, Master Malapert?" quoth my lady, nettled to
the quick at his +impertinence; - but her curiosity was not
half +satiated: so she was fain to gulp down her own insulted
dignity, and went on questioning and cross-questioning, till
she was ready to bubble over with spite and envy at Master
Wagtail's wonderful relations.  Poor thing! she did not
know what allowance to make for travelers' stories.
*Making wry faces.CLVII. - THE BROOK AND STAR- CONCLUDED.
1. THENCEFORWARD, the little brook *perfectly tloathed:
her own peaceful, tunobtrusive. lot. 8he would have shrunk
away, had it been possible, from the poor, innocent creatures,
who had so long enlivened her pleasant solitude. And,
worst of all, most unpardonable of all, she sickened at the
sight of her tbenignant star, which continued to look down
upon her as fondly and kindly as ever, still happily unconscious of her heartless testrangement. Well, she went on
fretting and repining- from day to day, till dame Nature, fairly
tired out with-her wayward humor, resolved to punish her, as she
deserved, by granting her heart's desire. One summer morning, came two sturdy woodmen, armed with saws, axes, and
bill-hook; to work they went, lopping, hewing, and clearing,
and before night-fall, there lay the little brook, exposed to
the broad +canopy of Heaven, revealed in all its littleness,
and effectually relieved from the *intrusion of those insignificant creatures, which had been scared from their oldi familiar
thaunt, by that day's +ruthless execution.
2. " Well:!-" quoth the little brook, "this is something like
life. What a fine world this is! A little chilly, though, and
I feel, I do n't know how, quite dazzled and confounded.
But to-morrow, when that great red orb comes over-head
again, I shall be warm and comfortable enough, no doubt;
and then, I dare say, some of those fine, great creatures will
come and visit me; and who knows but I may grow as big as
that great pond, in time, now that I enjoy the same advantages." Down went the sun; up rose the moon; out shone
innumerable hosts of sparkling orbs, and among them, that
"bright particular star" looked out, +pre-eminent in luster.
Doubtless, its pure and +radiant eye dwelt, with tender sorrow, on the altered condition of its beloved little brook. But
that +volatile and inconstant creature, quite intoxicated with
her change of fortune, and with the fancied admiration of the
twinkling myriads she beheld, danced and dimpled, in the
true spirit of tflirtation, with every glittering spark, till she
was quite bewildered among the multitude of her adorers,
and welcomed the gray hour of dawn, without having tvouch395
safed so much as one glance: of trecognition at her old,
tunalienated friend.
3. Down went the moon and stars; up rose the sun, and
higher and higher he mounted in the cloudless heaven, and
keener twaxed the impatience of the ambitious little brook.
N,ever did court beauty so eagerly *anticipate her first presentation to the eye of majestyl And, at last, arrived the hour
of tfruition.  Bright over-head +careered the radiant orb;
down darted his fervid', fiery beams +vertically upon the
center of the little brook, penetrating its shallow waterst to
the very pebbles beneath. At first, it was so awed: and; agitated, and overpowered by the condescendingi notice of majesty,
fancying, (as small folks are apt to faney,) that it had
attracted peculiar observation, that it was hardly sensible of
the unusual degree of warmth, which began to: +pervade its
elementary system: but presently, when the tfermentation of
its wits had a little subsided, it began to wonder how much
hotter it should grow, still assuring itself that the sensation,
though very novel, was exceedingly delightful.
4. But at length, such an. +accession of fever came on, that
the self-delusion was no longer tpracticable, and it began to
hiss, as if set over a great furnace. Oh, what would the
little brook have given now for only one bough: of the holly
or the hawthorn, to tintercept those tintolerable rays.! or for
the gentle winnowing of the black-bird's wing, or even the
poor robin's, to fan its glowing bosom. But those protecting
boughs. lay scattered aro:unad; those, small, shy creatures had
sought out a distant refuge,, and my lady bzook had nothing
left- but to endure what she could not alter.  "And, after
all," quoth she,' "''t: is only for a littlet while; by and by,
when his majesty only looks sidewise at: me, I shall be less
overcome with his royal favor, and in time, no doubt, be able
to sustain, his full gaze, without any of these unbecoming
+fiu:tters, all owing to my rustic education and the confined
life I have hitherto led."'
5. Well, "his majesty" withdrew westward-, as: usual, and
my lady brook began to subside into a comfortable degree of
temperature, and to gaze about her again, with restored
tcomplacency. What was her exultation, when she beheld:
the whole train of geese waddling, toward her from the greatEXAMPLES.

36pond, taking that way homeward out of sheer curiosity, as I
suppose. As the goodly company drew nearer and nearer,
our brook admired the stateliness of their carriage, and per.
suaded herself, it was eminently graceful, "for undoubtedly,
they are persons of distinguished rank," quoth she, "and
how much finer voices they must have, than those little, vulgar fowls, whose twittering used to make me so nervous."
Just then, the whole flock sat up such a gabbling and screechinga as they passed close by, that the little brook well nigh
leaped out of her reservoir, with horror and amazement; and
to complete her +consternation, one fat, old, dowager goose,
struggling awkwardly out of the line of march, plumped
right down into the middle of the pool, flouncing and floundering about at a terrible rate, filling its whole circumference
with her ungainly person, and scrambling out again with an
unfeeling +precipitation, which cruelly disordered the unhappy
victim of her tbarbarous toutrage.
6. Hardly were they out of sight, those awkward and unmannerly creatures,-hardly had the poor little brook begun
to breathe, after that terrible visitation, when all her powers
of self-possession were called for, by the abrupt approach of
another and more prodigious personage. A huge ox, goaded
by the intolerable stinging of a gad-fly, broke away from his
fellows of the herd and from his cool station in the great pond,
and came galloping down, in his blind agony, lashing the air
with his tail, and making the vale echo with his furious
bellowing. To the woods just beyond the new cleared spot,
he took his +frantic course, and, the little brook lying in
his way, he splashed into it and out of it without ceremony,
or probably so much as heeding the hapless object, subjected
to his ruffian treatment. That one splash pretty nearly +annihilated the miserable little brook.  The huge fore-hoofs
forced themselves into its mossy bank; the hind ones, with
a single textricating plunge, pounded bank and brook together
into a muddy hole; and the tail, with one insolent whisk,
spattered half the black mass over the surrounding herbage.
7. And now, what was wanting to complete the ruin and
degradation of the unhappy little brook? A thick, black puddle was all that remained of the once pellucid pool. Poor little
brook I if it had erred greatly, was it not greatly humbled?Night came again; but darkness was on the face of the unhappy brook, and well for it, that it was total darkness; for
in that state of conscious tdegradation, how could it have
sustained the searching gaze of its pure, forsaken star? Long,
dark, and companionless was the first night of misery, and
when morning dawned, though the tturbid water had regained
a degree of %transparency, it had shrunk away to a tenth
part of its former "fair proportions," so much had it lost by
+evaporation in that fierce solar talembic; so much from'tabsorption in the loosened and choking soil of its once firm
and beautiful margin; and so much by tdispersion, from the
wasteful thavoc of its destructive invaders.
8. Again, the great sun looked down upon it; again, the
vertical beams drank fiercely of its shrunken water; and
when evening came, no more remained of the poor little
orook, than just so many drops as filled the hollow of one of
those large pebbles which had paved its unsullied basin, in
the day of its brightness and beauty. But never, in the
season of its brightest tplenitude, was the water of the little
brook so clear, so perfectly clear and pure, as that last portion,
which lay, like a liquid gem, in the small concave of that
polished stone. It had been +filtered from every grosser
particle, refined by rough discipline, purified by adversity,
even from those lees of vanity and light-mindedness, which
had tadulterated its sparkling waters in their prosperous state.
Just as the last sun-beam was withdrawing its amber light
from that small pool, the old, familiar robin hopped on the
edge of the hollow pebble, and dipping his beak once and
again in the diminished tfount, which had slaked his thirst
so often and so long, drooped his +russet wings with a slight
quivering motion, and broke forth into a short, sweet gush of
parting song, before he winged his way forever from his
expiring benefactress.
9. Twilight had melted into night, dark night, for neither
moon nor stars were visible through the dark clouds that'
+canopied the earth. In darkness and silence lay the little
brook; forgotten it seemed, even by its benignant star, as
though its last drops were exhaled into nothingness, its
languishing existence already struck out of the list of created
things. Time had been, when such apparent neglect wouldNEW SIXTH READER.
have excited its highest indignation; but now, it submitted
humbly and resignedly to the deserved infliction.  And,
after a little while, looking fixedly upward, it almost fancied
that the form, if not the radiance of the beloved star was
faintly +perceptible through the +intervening darkness.
10. The little brook was not deceived; cloud after cloud
rolled away from the central heaven, till at last, the unchanging star was plainly tdisoernible through the fleecy vapor
which yet obscured its perfect luster. But, through that
silvery vail, the beautiful star looked intently on its repentant
love; and there was more of tenderness, of pity, and reconciliation in that dim, trembling gaze, than if the pure,
heavenly dweller had shone out in perfect brightness on the
frail, humbled creature below. Just then, a few large drops
fell heavily from the disparting cloud; and one trembling for
a moment with starry light, fell, like a forgiving tear, into
the bosom of the little pool.
11. Long, long and undisturbed, (for no other eye looked
out from heaven that n;ight,) was the last mysterious toommunion of the reconciled friends.  No dofbt, that voiceless
tintercourse was yet eloquent of hope and futurity; for
though all that remained of the pure little brook was sure to
be exhausted by the next day's fiery trial, it would but
change its visible form, to become an imperishable tessence:
and who can tell whether the elementary nature, so purged
from earthly timpurities, may not have been received up into
the sphere of its heavenly friend, and tindissolubly united
with the +celestial substance.

CLIX.- CHATHAM ON THE AMERICAN WAR.
1. I CAN NOT, my lords, I will not, join in congratulation
on misfortune and disgrace. This, my lords, is a fperilous
and tremendous moment. It is not a time for tadulation: the
smoothness of flattery can not save us, in this rugged and
awful crisis. It is now necessary to instruct the throne in the
language of truth. We must, if possible, dispel the tdelusion
and darkness which +envelop it; and display, in its full danger
and genuine colors, the ruin which is brought to our doors.
2. Can parliament be so dead to its true dignity and duty,
as to give their support to measures thus tobtruded and
forced upon them? Measures, my lords, which have reduced
this late flourishing empire to scorn and contempt!  "But
yesterday, and Britain might have stood against the world;
now, none so poor to do her freverence." The people whom
we first despised as rebels, but whom we now acknowledge as
enemies, are +abetted against us, supplied with every military
store, have their interest consulted, and their embassadors
entertained by our +inveterate enemy; and ministers do not,
and dare not, interpose with dignity or effect.
3. The desperate state of our army abroad is in part known.
No man more highly esteems or honors the British troops,
than I do. I know their virtues and their valor. I know they
can +achieve any thing but impossibilities; and I know that the
conquest of British America is an impossibility. You can not,
my lords, you can not conquer America. What is your present
situation there? We do not know the worst; but we know
that in three campaigns we have done nothing, and suffered
much. You may swell every expense, +accumulate every assistance, and extend your traffic to the +shambles of every German despot: your attempts will be forever timpotent; doubly
so, indeed, from this +mercenary aid on which you rely; for it
irritates, to an incurable resentment, the minds of your +adversaries, to overrun them with the mercenary sons of rapine and
plunder, devoting them and their possessions to the -rapacity
of hireling cruelty. If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I
never would lay down my arms;-- never - never-- NEVER!

4: But; my lords, who is the man, that, in additi2n to the
disgraces and mischief of the war, hals darecdto&amp;-auhojze -and
associate to our arms, the tomahawk and scalping-knifjevof the
savage? to call into civilized&amp;Aalliance, the wild and inhuman
inhabitant of the woods? to delegate to the mereiless Indian
the defense of disputed rights, and to wage the- horrors of his
barbarous war against our brethren? My lords, these +enormities cry aloud for redress and punishment. But, my lords,
this barbarous measure has been defended, not only dn'the
principles of policy and necessity, but also on those of morality: "for it is perfectly allowable," says Lord Suffolk, "to
use all the means which God and nature have put into our
hands." I am astonished, I am shocked, to hear such principles confessed; to hear them avQwed in this house, or in
this country.
5. My lords, I did not intend to +encroach so mud!c  on
your attention, but I can.not repress my indignation: if eel
myself +impelled to speak. My lords, we are called upon, as
members of this house, as men, as Christians, to protest
against such horrible barbarity. "That God and nature have
put'into our'hands! "  Whalt ideas of God and nature that
noble lord may entertain, I know not; but I kno!w, that such
detestable principles are equally +abhorrent to religion and
humanity. What! to attribute the sacred sanction of God
and nature to the massacres of -the Indiall scalping-knife!
to the cannibal savage, torturing, murdering, DEVOURING,
DRINKING THE BLOOD of his miangled victims! Such notions
shock every precept of morality, every feeling of humanity,
every sentiment of honor. These abominable principles, and
this more abominable avowal of them, dfmand the most decisive +indignation.
6. I call upon that right reverend, and this most learned
bench, to vindicate the religion of their God,4o support the
justice of their country.  I call upon the bishops, to interpose their tunsullied tsanctity; upon the judges, to' interpose
the purity of their +ermine, to save us: from this pollution.
I call upon the honor of your lordships, to reverence the'
dignity of your ancestors, and to maintain your own. I call
upon the spirit and humanity of my country, to vindicate
the national character.  I invoke the Genius of the Constitution.  From the +tapestry that adorns these walls, the immortal ancestor of this noble lord frowns with indignation, at the
disgrace of his country. In vain did he defend the liberty,
and establish the religion of Britain, against the tyranny of
Rome, if these worse than popish cruelties, and finquisitorial
practices, are endured among us.  To send forth the merciless
tcannibal, thirsting for blood! Against whom?  Your protestant brethren! - to lay waste their country, to desolate their
dwellings, and +extirpate their race and name, by the aid and
tinstrumentality,of these horrible hounds of war.
7. Spain can no longer boast +pre-eminence in barbarity.
She armed herself with bloodhounds, to +extirpate the
wretched natives of Mexico; we, more +ruthless, loose the
dogs of war against our countrymen in America, endeared to
us by every tie that can +sanctify humanity. I solemnly call
upon your lordships, and upon every order of men in the
state, to stamp upon this +infamous +procedure, the +indelible +stigma of the public abhorrence. More particularly, I
call upon the holy +prelates of our religion, to do away this
iniquity; let them perform a +lustration, to purify the country from this deep and deadly sin.  My lords, I am old and
weak, and unable to say more; but nmy feelings and indignation were too strong to have said less. I could not have slept
this night in my bed, nor even reposed my head upon my
pillow, without giving vent to my eternal +abhorrence of such
enormous and tpreposterous principles.
CLX.- SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS.
FROM WEBSTER.
Mr. WEBSTER, in a speech upon the life and character of John
Adams, imagines some one opposed to the Declaration of Independence, to have stated his fears and objections before Congress, while
deliberating on that subject. He then supposes Mr. Adams to have
replied, in the following language.
1. SINK or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my
hand and my heart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that in
the beginning, we aimed not at independence.  But there is
a divinity which shapes our ends. Th injustice of Englandhas driven us to'arms; and blinded to her own interest, she
has obstinately +persisted, till independence is now within
our grasp. We have but to reach forth to it, and it is ours.
Why then should we defer the declaration? Is any man so
weak, as now to hope for a +reconciliation with England,
which shall leave either safety to the country and its liberties,
or security to his own life and his own honor? Are not
you, sir, who sit in that chair,* is not he, our venerable
+colleague, near you,t are you not both already the tproscribed and +predestined objects of punishment and of
+vengeance?  Cut off from all hope of royal tclemency, what
are you, what can you be, while the power of England
remains, but outlaws?
2. If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry on, or
to give up the war? Do we mean to submit, and consent that
we shall be ground to powder, and our country and its rights
trodden down in the dust? I know we do not mean to,submit.
We NEVER shall submit I Do we intend to +violate that most
solemn obligation ever entered into by men, that plighting,
before God, of our sacred honor to Washington, when, putting
him forth to incur the dangers of war, as well as the political
hazards of the times, we promised to adhere to him in every
extremity with our fortunes and our lives? I know there is
not a man here, who would not rather see a general +conflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake sink it, than
one jot or tittle of that plighted faith fall to the ground. For
myself, having twelve months ago, in this place, moved you,
that George Washington be appointed commander of the
forces raised, or to be raised for the defense of American
liberty; may my right hand forget her cunning, and my
tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate or waver
in the support I give him.
3. The war, then, must go on. We must fight it through.
And if the war must go on, why put off the Declaration of
Independence? That measure will strengthen us. It will give
us character abroad. Nations will then treat with us, which
they never can do, while we acknowledge ourselves subjects
in arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain that Eng* John Hancock.      t Samuel Adams.land herself, will sooner treat for peace with us, on the footing
of independence, than consent, by repealing her acts, to
acknowledge that her whole conduct toward us has been a
course of injustice and oppression. Her pride will be less
wounded by submitting to that course of things, which now
+predestinates our independence, than by yielding the points
in +controversy to her rebellious subjects.  The former, she
would regard as the result of fortune; the latter, she would
feel as her own deep disgrace. Why, then do we not change
this from a civil to a national war? And since we must fight
it through, why not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all the
benefits of victory, if we gain the victory.
4. If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not
fail. The cause will raise up armies; the cause will create
navies. The people, the people, if we are true to them, will
carry us, and will carry themselves, gloriously through this
struggle. I care not how fickle other people have been found.
I know the people of these colonies; and I know that resis-'
tance to British faggression, is deep and settled in their
hearts, and can not be +eradicated. Sir, the Declaration of
Independence will inspire the people with increased courage.
Instead of a long and bloody war for the restoration of
privileges, for +redress of grievances, for +chartered +immunities, held under a British king, set before them the glorious
object of entire independence, and it will breathe into themn
anew the spirit of life.
5. Read this declaration at the head of the army; every
sword will be drawn, and the solemn vow uttered to maintain
it, or perish on the bed of honor. Publish it from the
pulpit; religion will approve it, and the love of religious liberty will cling around it, resolved to stand with it, or fall
with it. Send it to the public halls; proclaim it there; let
them see it, who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the
field of Bunker Hill, and in the streets of Lexin/gtoir and
Concord, and the very walls will cry out in its support.
6. Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see,
I see clearly through this day's business. You and I, indeed,
may rue it. We may not live to see the time this declaration
shall be made good. We may die; die colonists; die slaves;
die, it may be, tignominiously, and on the scaffold. Be it so.tocles', Demosthenes'-, Pindar', Phidias', Euripides', Apelles-,
and Aristides', were distinguished men.
REMARK 3.-The only correct rules upon this or any subject connected with language, are merely a record of good
usage, that is, such as is authorized by a majority of the best
speakers and writers of the day. It is becoming more common than formerly for speakers to deliver the whole of a concluding series with the falling inflection and the whole of a
commencing series with.the rising inflection, and it is not improbable that this may be ere long the prevailing custom.
PARENTHESIS.
RULE XII.-A clause included in a parenthesis, should
be read more rapidly and in a lower tone than the rest
of the sentence, and should terminate with the same inflection that next precedes it. If, however, it is complicated, or emphatic, or disconnected with the main subject, the inflections must be governed by the same rules
as in other cases.
EXAMPLES.
1. God is my witness', (whom I serve with my spirit, in the
gospel of his Son-,) that, without ceasing, I make mention of
you always in my prayers, making request', (if, by any means,
now at length, I might have a prosperous journey by the will of
God',) to come unto you.
2. When he had entered the room three paces, he stood still;
and laying his left hand upon his breast', (a slender, white staff
with which he journeyed being in his right',) he introduced himself with the little story of his convent.
3. If you, AEschines, in particular, were persuaded', (and it was
no particular affection for me, that prompted you to give up th-e
hopes, the appliances, the honors, which attended the course I then
advised; but the superior force of truth, and your utter inability to
point any course more eligible'-,) if this was the case, I say, is it
not highly cruel and unjust to arraign these measures now, when
you could not then propose a better?
4. As the hour of conflict grew near' (and this was a conflict to
be dreaded even by him'-), he began to waver and to abate much
of his boasting.Be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country
shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be
ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour
may.  But while I do live, let nie have a country, or at least
the hope of a country, and that a FREE coltntry.
7. But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured
that this declaration will sland.  It may cost treasure, and it
may cost blood; but it will stand, and it will richly tcompensate for both. Through the thick gloom of the present,
I see the brightness of the future, as the sun in heaven.  We
shall make this a glorious, an immortal day.  When we are
in our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate
it with thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and tilluminations. On its annual returd. they will shed tears, copious, gushing tears; not of subjection and slavery, not of agony
and distress, but of texultation, of gratitude, and of joy.
8. Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come.  My judgment approves the measure, and my whole heart is in it.  All
that I have, and all that I am, and all that I hope in this life,
I am now ready here to stake upon it; and I leave off as I
began, that, live or die, survive or perish, I am for the declaration.  It is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing of
God, it shall be my dying sentiment; independence nowv and
INDEPENDENCE FOREVER.
CLXI.- THE PARTING OF MARMION AND DOUGLAS.
FRO3M WALTER SCOTT.
IN the poem, from which this extract is taken, Marmion is represented as
an embassador, sent by Henry VIII, king of England, to James IV, king of
Scotland, who were at war with each other. Having finished his mission to
James, Marmion was intrusted to the protection and hospitality of Douglas,
one of the Scottish nobles. Douglas entertains him, treats him with tho
respect due to his office and to the honor of his sovereign, yet he despises
his private character. Marmion perceives this, and takes +umbrage at it,
though he attempts to repress his resentment, and desires to part in peace.
Under these circumstances, the scene, as described in this sketch, takes
place. Tantallon is the name of Douglas' castle.
1. NOT far advanced was morning day,
When Marmion did his troop +array,
To Surrey's camp to ride;He had safe +conduct for his band,
Beneath the royal seal and hand,
And Douglas' gave a guide.
2. The train from out the castle drew,
But Marmion stopp'd to bid adieu:
"Though something I might'plain," he*said,
"Of cold respect to stranger guest,
Sent hither by the king's tbehest,
While in Tantallon's towers I staid,
Part we in friendship from your land,
And, noble Earl, receive my hand."
But Douglas round him drew his cloak,
Folded his arms, and thus he spoke:
"My +manors, halls, and towers shall still
Be open at my sovereign's will,
To each one whom he tlists, howe'er
Unmeet to be the owner's peer,
My castles are my king's alone,
From turret to tfoundation stone;
The hand of Douglas is his own;
And never shall, in friendly grasp,
The hand of such as Marmion clasp."
3. Burn'd Marmion's +swarthy cheek like fire,
And shook his very frame for +ire;
And "This to me," he said,
"And't were not for thy hoary beard,
Such hand as Marmion's had not spared
To cleave the Douglas' head!
And first, I tell thee, haughty peer,
He who does England's message here,
Although the meanest in her state,
May well, proud Angus, be thy mate:
And Douglas, more, I tell thee here,
Even in thy +pitch of pride,
Here, in thy hold, thy tvassals near,
I tell thee, thou'rt defied I
And if thou said'st I am not peer
To any lord in Scotland here,
Lowland or Highland, far or near,
Lord Angus, thou-hast-lied I
4. On the Earl's cheek, the flush of rage
O'ercame the ashen hue of age:Fierce he broke forth; "And dar'st thou then
To beard the lion in his den,
The Douglas in his hall?
And hop'st thou thence +unscathed to go?
No, by St. Bryde of Bothwell, no I
Up drawbridge, grooms,-what, warder, ho!
Let the +portcullis fall."'
Lord Marmion turn'd,-well was his need,And dash'd the rowels in his steed,
Like arrow through the arch-way sprung;
The +ponderous gate behind him rung:
To pass there was such scanty room,
The bars, descending, grazed his plume.
5. The steed along the drawbridge flies,
Just as it trembled on the rise:
Not lighter does the swallow skim
Along the smooth lake's level brim;
And when lord Marmion reach'd his band
He halts and turns with clinch-ed hand,
And shout of loud +defiance pours,
And shook his +gauntlet at the towers.
"Horse I horse I" the Douglas cried, "and chase I"
But soon he rein'd his fury's pace:
"A royal messenger he came,
Though most unworthy of the name:
Saint Mary mend my fiery mood!
Old age ne'er cools the Douglas' blood;
I thought to slay him where he stood.'T is pity of him, too," he cried;
"Bold he can speak, and fairly ride;
I warrant him a warrior tried."
With this, his +mandate he recalls,
And slowly seeks his castle walls.
CLXII. - THE GRAVE.
FROM IRVING.
1. THE sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which
we refuse to be divorced. Every other wound we seek to heal;
every other affliction, to forget; but this wound, we consider
it a duty to keep open. This affliction we cherish, and brood
over in solitude. Where is the mother, who would willinglyforget the infant that has perished like a blossom from her
arms, though every recollection is a pang?  Where is the
child that would willingly forget a tender parent, though to
remember be but to lament? Who, even in the hour of  
fagony, would forget the friend, over whom he mourns?
2. No, the love which tsurvives the tomb, is one of the
noblest attributes of the soul.  If it has its woes, it has
likewise its delights; and when the overwhelming burst of
grief is calmed into the gentle tear of recollection; when the
sudden +anguish, and the +convulsive agony over the present
ruins of all that we most loved, is softened away into pensive
meditation on all that it was, in the days of its loveliness,
who would root out such a sorrow from the heart?  Though
it may, sometimes, throw a passing cloud over the bright
hour of gayety, or spread a deeper sadness over the hour of
gloom, yet, who would exchange it, even for the song of
pleasure, or the burst of +revelry?  No, there is a voice from
the tomb sweeter than song. There is a remembrance of the
dead, to which we turn, even from the charms of the living.
3. Oh, the grave! the grave! It buries every error, covers
every defect, textinguishes every resentment!  From  its
peaceful bosom, spring none but fond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down upon the grave, even of an
enemy, and not feel a tcompunctious tthrob, that he should
have warred with the poor handful of earth that lies +moldering before him? But the grave of those we loved, what a
place for meditation! There it is, that we call up, in long
review, the whole history of virtue and gentleness, and the
thousand endearments +lavished upon us, almost unheeded,
in the daily tintercourse of intimacy; there it is, that we
dwell upon the tenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of
the parting scene; the bed of death, with all its stifled griefs,
its noiseless attendance, its mute, watchful tassiduities! the
last testimonies of expiring love! the feeble, fluttering, thrilling,-oh, how thrilling!-pressure of the hand! the last fond
look of the glazing eye turning upon us, even from the
threshold of existence! the faint, faltering accents, struggling
in death to give one more assurance of -affection!
4. Ay, go to the grave of buried love, and meditate I
There settle the account with thy conscience, for every past
35benefit +unrequited; every past endearment unregarded, of
that departed being, who can never-never-never return
to be soothed by thy +contrition! If thou art a child, and
hast ever added a sorrow to the soul, or a furrow to the
silvered brow of an affectionate parent; if thou art a husband, and hast ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its
whole happiness in thy arms, to doubt one moment of thy
kindness or thy truth; if thou art a friend, and hast ever
wronged, in thought, or word, or deed, the spirit that
generously confided in thee; if thou hast given one unmerited pang to that true heart, which now lies cold and
still beneath thy feet; then be sure, that every unkind look,
every ungracious word, every ungentle action, will come
thronging back upon thy memory, and knocking +dolefully at
thy soul; then be sure, that thou wilt lie down sorrowing
and repentant on the grave, and utter the unheard groan, and
pour the +unavailing tear; more deep, more bitter, because
unheard and unavailing.
5. Then weave thy +chaplet of flowers, and strew the
beauties of nature about the grave; console thy broken spirit,
if thou canst, with these tender, yet *futile +tributes of regret; but take warning, by the bitterness of this, thy contrite
affliction over the dead, and henceforth, be more faithful and
affectionate in the discharge of thy duties to the living.

CLXIV. -ANECDOTE OF THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.
A LAUGHABLE story was circulated during the administration of the
old Duke of Newcastle, and tretailed'to the public in various forms.
This nobleman, with many good points, was remarkable for being +profuse of his promises on all occasions, and valued himself particularly,
on being able to +anticipate the words or the wants of the various
persons who attended his levees, before they uttered a word. This
sometimes led him into ridiculous +embarrassments; and it was this
proneness to lavish promises, which gave occasion for the following
anecdote.
1. AT the election of a certain +borough in Cornwall, where
the opposite interests were almost equally tpoised, a single
vote was of the highest importance. This object, the Duke by
well applied argument and personal application, at length
attained; and the gentleman he recommended, gained the
election.  In the warmth of gratitude, his grace poured forth
acknowledgments and promises without ceasing, on the fortunate possessor of the casting vote; called him his best and
dearest friend; protested, that he should consider himself as
forever indebted to him; that he would serve him by night
or by day.
2. The Cornish voter, who was an honest fellow, and would
not have thought himself entitled to any reward, but for such
a +torrent of acknowledgments, thanked the Duke for his
kindness, and told him, "The +supervisor of +excise was old
and infirm, and if he would have the goodness to recommend
his son-in-law to the commissioners, in case of the old man's
death, he should think himself and his family bound to render
his grace every assistance in his power, on any future occasion."  "My dear friend, why do you ask for such a trifling
employment?" exclaimed his grace, " your relative shall have
it, the moment the place is vacant, if you will but call, my
attention to it."  " But how shall I get admitted to you, my
lord? for in London, I understand, it is a very difficult business to get a sight of you great folks, though you are so kind413'
and +complaisant to us in the country."  "The instant the
man dies," replied the Duke, 1" set out, post-haste, for London; drive directly to my house, and be it by night or by
day, thunder at the door; I will leave word with my porter,
to show you up stairs directly; and the employment shall be
disposed of according to your wishes."
3. The parties separated; the Duke drove to a friend's
house in the neighborhood, without a wish or desire to see
his new acquaintance till that day seven years; but the
memory of a Cornish elector, not being burdened with such a
variety of objects, was more +retentive. The supervisor died
a few months after, and the Duke's humble friend, relying on
the word of a peer, was conveyed to London post-haste, and
ascended with alacrity the steps of that nobleman's palace.
4. The reader should be informed, that just at this time, no
less a person than the king of Spain was expected hourly to
depart; an event in which the minister of Great Britain was
particularly concerned; and the Duke of Newcastle, on the
very night that the proprietor of the decisive vote arrived at
his door, had sat up anxiously expecting tdispatches from
Madrid. Wearied by official business and agitated spirits, he
retired to rest, having previously given particular instructions
to his porter not to go to bed, as he expected, every minute, a
messenger with advices of the greatest importance, and desired
he might be shown up stairs, the moment of his arrival.
5. His grace was sound asleep; and the tporter, settled
for the night, in his arm-chair, had already commenced a
tsonorous nap, when the vigorous arm of the Cornish voter
roused him from his slumbers. To his first question, "Is
the Duke at home?" the porter replied, "Yes, and in bed;
but has left particular orders, that come when you will, you
are to go up to him  directly."  "Bless him, for a worthy
and honest gentleman," cried our applicant for the vacant
post, smiling and nodding with +approbation, at the prime
minister's kindness, "how punctual his grace is; I knew he
would not deceive me; let me hear no more of lords' and
dukes' not keeping their word; I verily believe they are as
honest, and mean as well as any other folks."  Having
ascended the stairs as he was speaking, he was ushered into
the Duke's bed-chamber.6. "Is he dead?" exclaimed his grace, rubbing his eyes,
and scarcely awakened from dreaming of the king of Spain,
"Is he dead?"  "Yes, my lord," replied the eager expectant,
delighted to find the election promise, with all its circumstances, so fresh in the nobleman's memory. "When did he
die?"  "The day before yesterday, exactly at half past one
o'clock, after being confined three weeks to his bed, and
taking a power of doctor's stuff; and I hope your grace will
be as good as your word, and let my son-in-law succeed him."
7. The Duke, by this time perfectly awake, was staggered
at the impossibility of receiving intelligence from Madrid in
so short a space of time; and perplexed at the fabsurdity of
a king's messenger applying for his son-in-law to succeed the
king of Spain: "Is the man drunk, or mad? Where are
your tdispatches!" exclaimed his grace, hastily drawing back
his curtain; where, instead of a royal courier, his eager eye
recognized at the bed-side, the well known countenance of
his friend from Cornwall, making low bows, with hat in
hand, and "hoping my lord would not forget the gracious
promise he was so good as to make, in favor of his son-inlaw, at the last election."
8. Vexed at so untimely a disturbance, and disappointed
of news from Spain, the Duke frowned for a moment; but
*chagrin soon gave way to mirth, at so singular and ridiculous a +combination of circumstances, and yielding to the
impulse, he sunk uipon the bed in a violent fit of laughter,
which was communicated in a moment to the attendants.
9. The relater of this little narrative, concludes, with observing, "Although the Duke of Newcastle could not place
the relative of his old acquaintance on the throne of His
Catholic Majesty, he advanced him to a post not less honorable,-he made him an +exciseman.
CLXV.- LOCHINVAR.
FROM SCOTT.
1. O0 YOUNG Lochinvar is come out of the West,
Through all the wide border his steed was the best;
And save his good broad-sword, he weapon had none,
He rode all unarm'd, and he rode all alone.415
So faithful in love, and so +dauntless in war,
There never was knight like young Lochinvar.
2. He staid not for +brake, and he stopp'd not for stone,
He swam the Eske river where +ford there was none;
But, ere he alighted at Netherby gate,
The bride had consented, the gallant came late:
For a tlaggard in love and a dastard in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
3. So boldly he enter'd the Netherby hall,
Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,
(For the poor, tcraven bridegroom said never a word.)
"O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to dance at our tbridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"
4. " I long +woo'd your daughter, my suit you denied;
Love swells like the Solway, but +ebbs like its tide;
And now, am I come with this lost love of mine,
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,
That would gladly be bride to young Lochinvar."
5. The bride kiss'd the goblet, the knight took it up,
He quaff'd off the wine, and threw down the cup.
She look'd down to blush, and she look'd up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.
Ie took her soft hand, ere her mother could +bar,
" Now tread we a measure!" said young Lochinvar.
6. So stately his form, and so lovely her face,
That never a hall such a +galliard did grace;
While her mother did fret and her father did fume,
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
And the bridemaidens whisper'd "'T were better by far,
To have match'd our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."
7. One touch to her hand and one word in her ear,
When they reach'd the hall door, and their +charger stood near,
So light to the croup the fair lady he swung,
So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
" She is won f we are gone, over bank, bush, and +scaur;
They'll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth young Lochinvar.

CLXVI.- SPEECH ON THE TRIAL OF A MURDERER.
FROM WEBSTER.
1. AGAINST the prisoner at the bar, as an individual, I can
not have the slightest prejudice.  I would not do him the
smallest injury or injustice. But I do not affect to be indifferent to the discovery and the punishment of his deep guilt.
I cheerfully share in the topprobrium, how much seever it may
be, which is cast on those who feel and manifest an anxious concern, that all who had a part in planning, or a hand in executing this deed of midnight +assassination, may be brought to
answer for their +enormous crime at the bar of public justice.
2. This is a most +extraordinary case. In some respects
it has hardly a +precedent any where; certainly none in our
New England history.  This bloody +drama exhibited no
suddenly excited, ungovernable rage. The actors in it were
not surprised by any lion-like temptation upon their virtue,
overcoming it before resistance could begin. Nor did they
do the deed to +glut savage vengeance, or +satiate long-settled
and deadly hate. It was a cool, calculating, money-making
murder. It was all "hire and salary, and not revenge." It
was the weighing of money against life; the counting out of
so many pieces of silver against so many ounces of blood.
3. An aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his
own house, and in his own bed, is made the victim of butcherly
murder for mere pay. Truly, here is a new lesson for
painters and poets. Whoever shall hereafter draw the portrait of murder, if he will show it, as it has been exhibited in
an example, where such example was least to have been
looked for, in the very bosom of our New England society,
let him not give it the +grim +visage of +Moloch, the brow
knitted by revenge, the face black with settled hate, and the
blood-shot eye +emitting +livid fires of malice; let him draw,
rather, a decorous, smooth-faced, bloodless +demon; a picture
in repose, rather than in action; not so much an example of417
human nature in its depravity and in its tparoxysm of crime,
as an +infernal nature, a fiend in the ordinary display and
+development of his character.
4. The deed was executed with a degree of self-possession
and steadiness, equal to the wickedness with which it was
planned. The circumstances now clearly in evidence, spread
out the whole scene before us. Deep sleep had fallen on the
-destined victim, and on all beneath his roof. A  healthful
old man, to whom sleep was sweet; the first sound slumbers
of the night held\him in their soft but strong embrace.  The
tassassin enters through the window, already prepared, into
an unoccupied apartment. With noiseless foot he paces the
lonely hall, half lighted by the moon; he winds up the ascent
of the stairs, and reaches the door of the chamber. Of this,  
he moves the lock, by soft and continued pressure, till it turns
on its hinges; and he enters, and beholds his victim before
him. The room was uncommonly open to the admission of
light. The face of the innocent sleeper was turned from the
murderer, and the beams of the moon, resting on the gray
locks of his aged temple, showed him where to strike. The
fatal blow is given! and the victim passes without a struggle
or a motion, from the repose of sleep to the repose of death!
5. It is the assassin's purpose to make sure work; and he
yet -plies the dagger, though it was obvious that life had
been destroyed by the blow of the *bludgeon.  He even
raises the aged arm, that he may not fail in his aim at the
heart; and replaces it again over the wounds of the +poniard!
To finish the picture, he explores the wrist for the pulse I He
feels it, and ascertains that it beats no longer!  It is accomplished. *The deed is done. He retreats, retraces his steps
to the window, passes out through it as he came in, and
escapes. He has done the murder; no eye has seen him, no
ear has heard him. The secret is his own. and it is safe!
6. Ah! gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a
secret can be safe nowhere. The whole creation of God has
neither nook nor corner, where the guilty can bestow it, and
sa.y it is safe. Not to speak of that eye which glances
through all disguises, and beholds every thing as in the splendor of noon; such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even by men. True it is, generally speaking, that"murder will out." True it is, that Providence hath so
tordained, and doth so govern things, that those who break
the great law of heaven, by shedding men's blood, seldom
succeed in avoiding discovery.  Especially, in a case exciting
so much attention as this, discovery must come, and will
come, sooner or later. A thousand eyes turn at once to explore every man, every thing, every circumstance connected
with the time and place; a thousand ears catch every whisper;
a thousand excited minds tintensely dwell on the scene, shedding all their light, and ready to kindle, at the slightest
circumstance, into a blaze of discovery.
7. Meantime, the guilty soul can not keep its own secret.
It is false to itself, or rather it feels an +irresistible timpulse
to be true to itself. It labors under its guilty possession, and
knows not what to do with it. The human heart was not
made for the residence of such an inhabitant. It finds itself
preyed on by a torment, which it does not acknowledge to
God nor man. A vulture is deveuring it, and it can ask no
sympathy nor assistance, either from heaven or earth. The
secret which the murderer possesses, soon comes to possess
him; and like the evil spirits of which we read, it overcomes
him, and leads him whithersoever it will. He feels it beating
at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding +disclosure.
He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his
eyes, and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his
thoughts. It has become his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence.
TWhen suspicions from without begin to +embarrass him, and
the net of circumstances to entangle him, the fatal secret
struggles with still greater violence to burst forth. It must
be confessed, it will be confessed; there is no refuge from
confession but suicide, and suicide is confession.
CLXVII. - FALL OF CARDINAL WOLSEY.
FROM SHAKSPEARE.
Wolsey. FAREWELL, a long farewell to all my greatness;
This is the state of man: to-day, he puts forth
The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow, blossoms,
And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;419
The third day, comes a frost, a killing frost,
And,-when he thinks, good, easy man, full surely
His greatness is a ripening-+nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
Like little, wanton boys, that swim on bladders,
These many summers, in a sea of glory,
But far beyond my depth; my high-blown pride
At length broke under me; and now has left me,
Weary, and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.
Vain tpomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
I feel my heart now open'd. 0, how wretched
Is that poor man, that hangs on princes' tfavors I
There are betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That +aspect sweet of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears, than wars or women have,
And when he falls, he falls like fLucifer,
Never to hope again.
Enter CROMWELL amazedly.
Why, how now, Cromwell?
Criom. I have no power to speak, sir.
Wol. What! tamazed
At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder,
A great man should decline? Nay, if you weep,
I am fallen indeed.
Groin. How does your grace?
Wol. Why, well;
Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
I know myself now; and I feel within me
A peace above all earthly tdignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,
I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,
These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken
A load would sink a navy,-too much honor:
O,'t is a burden, Cromwell,'t is a burden,
~Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.
Crom. I am glad. your grace has made that right use of it.
Wol. I hope I have. I am able now, methinks,
Out of a tfortitude of soul I feel,
To endure more miseries, and greater far,
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
What news abroad?
Crom. The heaviest, and the worst,
Is your displeasure* with the king.;
* Here used for diegrace.Wol. God bless him I
Crom. The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosea
Lord Chancellor in your place.
Wol. That's somewhat sudden:
But he's a learned man. May he continue
Long in his highness' favor, and do justice
For truth's sake, and his conscience; that his bones,
When he has run his course, and sleeps in blessings,
May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on'em!
What more?
Crom. That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
+Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
Wol. That's news indeed!
Crom. Last, that the Lady Anne,
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
This day was view'd in public, as his queen,
Going to chapel; and the voice is now
Only about her tcoronation.
Wol. There was the weight that pull'd me down. 0 Cromwell,
The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
In that one woman I have lost forever:
No sun shall ever tusher forth mine honors,
Or gild again the noble troops that waited
Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;
I am a poor, fallen man, unworthy now
To be thy lord and master. Seek the king;
That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
Some little memory of me will stir him,
(I know his noble nature,) not to let
Thy hopeful service perish, too. Good Cromwell,
Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
For thine own future safety.
Grom. O, my lord,
Must I then leave you? Must I needs forego
So good, so noble, and so true a master?
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord;
The king shall have my service, but my prayers
Forever and forever shall be yours.
Wol. Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,And sleep in dull, cold marble, where no mention
Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
And sounded all the depths and tshoals of honor,
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.
Cromwell, I charge thee fling away ambition;
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?
Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee;
tCorruption wins not more than honesty,
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not;
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
Thy God's, and truth's; then, if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr. Serve the king;
And,-prithee, lead me in.
There, take an +inventory of all I have,
To the last penny;'t is the king's: my robe,
And my integrity to Heaven, is all
I dare now call my own. O Cromwell, Cromwell,
Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal
I serv'd my king, he would not, in mine age
Have left me naked to mine enemies.
Crom. Good sir, have patience.
Wol. So I have. Farewell,
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.
CLXVIII.- OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH.
FROM DR. SPRING.
1. THE Sabbath lies at the foundation of all true morality.
tMorality flows from principle.  Let the principles of moral
tobligation become'relaxed, and the practice of morality will
not long survive the overthrow. No man can preserve his
own morals, no parent can preserve the morals of his children, without the impressions of religious obligation.
2. If you can induce a +community to doubt the genuineness and tauthenticity of the Scriptures; to question the reality and obligations of religion; to hesitate, undeciding,whether there be any such thing as virtue or vice; whether
there be an eternal state of retribution beyond the grave; or
whether there exists any such being as God, you have broken
down the tbarriers of moral virtue, and hoisted the floodgates of immorality and crime. I need not say, that when a
people have once done this, they can no longer exist as a
tranquil and happy people. Every bond that holds society
together would be ruptured; fraud and treachery would take
the place of confidence between man and man; the ttribunals
of justice would be scenes of bribery and injustice; tavarice,
*perjury, ambition, and revenge would walk through the land,
and render it more like the dwelling of savage beasts, than
the tranquil abode of civilized and christianized men.
3. If there is an institution which opposes itself to this
progress of human tdegeneracy, and throws a shield before
the interests of moral virtue in our thoughtless and wayward
world, it is the Sabbath. In the fearful struggle between virtue and vice, notwithstanding the powerful auxiliaries which
wickedness finds in the bosoms of men, and in the +seductions and influence of popular example, wherever the Sabbath has been suffered to live, the trembling interests of
moral virtue have always been revered and sustained. One
of the principal occupations of this day, is to illustrate and
enforce the great principles of sound morality. Where this
sacred trust is preserved tinviolate, you behold a nation +convened one day in seven, for the purpose of acquainting themselves with the best moral principles and precepts. And it
can not be otherwise, than that the authority of moral virtue,
under such auspices, should be acknowledged and felt.
4. We may not, at once, perceive the effects which this
weekly observance produces. Like most moral causes, it operates slowly; but it operates surely, and gradually weakens
the power, and breaks the yoke of profligacy and sin. No
villain regards the Sabbath. No vicious family regards the
Sabbath. No immoral communityregardsthe Sabbath. The
holy rest of this ever-memorable day, is a barrier which is
always broken down, before men become giants in sin.
Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England,
remarks, that " a curruption of morals usually follows a profanation of the Sabbath." It is an observation of Lord ChiefJustice Hale, that " of all the persons who were convicted of
capital crimes, while he was upon the bench, he found a few
only, who would not confess that they began their tcareer of
wickedness by a neglect of the duties of the Sabbath, and
vicious conduct on that day."
5. The prisons in our own land could probably tell us, that
they have scarcely a solitary tenant, who had not broken over
the restraints of the Sabbath, before he was abandoned to
crime. You may tenact laws for the suppression of immorality; but the secret and silent power of the Sabbath constitutes a stronger shield to the vital interest of the community,
than any code of tpenal statutes that ever was enacted. The
Sabbath is the keystone of the arch which sustains the temple of virtue, which, however +defaced, will survive many a
rude shock, so long as the foundatibn remains firm.
6. The observance of the Sabbath is, also, most influential
in securing national prosperity. The God of Heaven has
said, " Them that honor me, will I honor."  You will not
often find a notoriout Sabbath-breaker a permanently prosperous man; and a Sabbath-breaking community is never a
happy or prosperous community. There are a multitude of
unobserved influences, which the Sabbath exerts upon the
temporal welfare of men. It promotes the spirit of good
order and harmony; it elevates the poor from want; it
ttransforms squalid wretchedness; it imparts self-respect and
elevation of character; it promotes softness and civility of
manners; it brings together the rich and the poor, upon one
common level, in the house of prayer; it purifies and
strengthens the social affections, and makes the family circle
the center of +allurement, and the source of instruction, comfort, and happiness. Like its own divine religion, "it has
the promise of the life that now is, and that which is to
come," for men can not put themselves beyond the reach of
hope and heaven, so long as they treasure up this one
command, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."CLXIX. - GOD'S GOODNESS TO SUCH AS FEAR HIM.
1. FRET not thyself because of evil doers,
Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity;
For they shall be cut down like the grass,
And wither as the green herb.
Trust in the LORD and do good;
So shalt thou dwell in the land, and +verily thou shalt be fed.
Delight thyself, also, in the LORD,
And He shall give thee the desires of thy heart.
Commit thy way unto the LORD;
Trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass,
And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,
And thy judgment as the noon-day.
Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him.
2. Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way,
Because of the man who bringeth wicked tdevices to pass.
Cease from anger and forsake wrath;
Fret not thyself, in any wise, to do evil,
For evil-doers shall be cut off;
But those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be;
Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
But the meek shall inherit the earth,
And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
3. A little, that a righteous man hath,
Is better than the riches of many wicked;
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
But the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
The LORD knoweth the days of the upright,
And their inheritance shall be forever;
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time;
And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
4. The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD,
And he delighteth in his way;
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down,
For the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.
But the wicked shall perish,
And the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs,
They shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
The wicked borroweth and payeth not again;
But the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth.
For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the earth.5. I have been young, and now am old,
Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,
Nor his seed begging bread.
IIe is ever merciful and lendeth,
And his seed is blessed.
6. Depart from evil and do good,
And dwell for evermore;
For the LORD loveth judgment,
And forsaketh not his saints:
They are preserved forever:
But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
The righteous shall inherit the land,
And dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom,
And his tongue talketh of judgment;
The law of his God is in his heart;
None of his steps shall slide.
The wicked watcheth the righteous,
And seeketh to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand,
Nor condemn him when he is judged.
7. Wait on the LORD and keep his way,
And I-e shall exalt thee to inherit the land;
When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it,
I have seen the wicked in great power,
And spreading himself like a green +bay-tree;
Yet he passed away, and lo, he was not;
Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
CLXX. - CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS.
FROM IRVING.
1. COLUMBUS was a man of great and +inventive genius.
The operations of his mind were +energetic, but irregular;
bursting forth, at times, with that irresistible force which
characterizes intellect of such an order.  His ambition was
lofty and noble, inspiring him with high thoughts, and an
anxiety to distinguish himself by great +achievements. He
aimed at dignity and wealth in the same elevated spirit with
which he sought renown; they.were to rise from the territories he should discover, and be commensurate in importance.
365.    His br6ad expanded wings
Lay calm and motionless upon the air,
As if he floated there without their aid,
By the sole act of his unl6rded will.

III. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.
ACCENT.
THAT syllable in a word which is uttered more forcibly
than the others, is said to be accented; as the italicized syllables in the following words:
EXAMPLES..Morn-ing,                     pos-si-ble,
Ty-rant,                       re-cum-bent,
Pro-cuere,                     ex-or-bi-tant,
De-bate,                       com-pre-hen-sive.
Accent when marked, is denoted by the same characters
as those used in inflection; the acute accent, by ('), and
the grave, by (-). The latter is merely a nominal distinction,
and means only, that the syllable thus marked is not accented
at all.
Common usage alone determines upon which syllable the
accent should be placed, and to the lexicographer it belongs,
to ascertain and record its decision on this point.
In some few cases, we can trace the reasons for common
usage in this respect.  In words which are used as different
parts of speech, or which have different meanings, the distinction is sometimes denoted by changing the accent.NEW SIXTH READER.
2. His conduct was characterized by the grandeur of his
views, and the tmagnanimity of his spirit. Instead of ravaging the newly found countries, like many of his cotemporary
discoverers, who were intent only on immediate gain, he
regarded them with the eyes of a legislator; he sought to
colonize and cultivate them, to civilize the natives, to build
cities, introduce the useful arts, subject every thing to the
control of law, order, and religion, and thus to found regular
and prosperous empires. That he failed in this, was the fault
of the dissolute trabble which it was his misfortune to
command, with whom all law was tyranny, and all order
oppression.
3. He was naturally +irascible and +impetuous, and keenly
sensible to injury and injustice; yet the quickness of his
temper was counteracted by the generosity and benevolence
of his heart.  The magnanimity of his nature shone forth
through all the troubles of his stormy career. Though continually outraged in his dignity, braved in his authority,
foiled in his plans, and endangered in his person, by the
tseditions of +turbulent and worthless men, and that, too, at
times when suffering under anguish of body and anxiety of
mind, enough to texasperate the most patient, yet he restrained his valiant and indignant spirit, and brought himself
to forbear, and reason, and even to supplicate. Nor can the
reader of the story of his eventful life, fail to notice how free
he was from all feeling of revenge, how ready to forgive and
forget, on the least sign of repentance and atonement. He
has been exalted for his skill in +controlling others, but far
greater praise is due to him for the firmness he displayed in
governing himself.
4. His piety was genuine and fervent. Religion mingled
with the whole course of his thoughts and actions, and shone
forth in his most private and unstudied writings. Whenever
he made any great discovery, he devoutly returned thanks to
God. The voice of prayer and the melody of praise, rose from
his ships on discovering the new world, and his first action on
landing was, to prostrate himself upon the earth, and offer up
thanksgiving. All his great enterprises were undertaken in
the name of the Holy Trinity, and he partook of the holy
sacrament previous to +embarkation. He observed the festi427
vals of the Church in the wildest situations. The Sabbath
was to him a day of sacred rest, on which he would never sail
from a port, unless in case of extreme necessity. The religion
thus deeply seated in his soul, tdiffused a sober dignity and
a benign composure, over his whole tdeportment; his very
language was pure and guarded, and free from all gr6ss or
irreverent expressions.
5. A peculiar trait in his rich and varied character remains
to be noticed; namely, that ardent and enthusiastic imagination, which threw a magnificence over his whole course of
thought. A poetical +temperament is discernible throughout
all his writings, and in all his actions. We see it in all his
descriptions of the beauties of the wild land he was discovering,
in the enthusiasm with which he extolled the +blandness of the
temperature, the purity of the atmosphere, the fragrance of
the air, "full of dew and sweetness," the verdure of the
forests, the grandeur of the mountains, and the crystal purity
of the running streams.  It spread a glorious and golden
world around him, and tinged everything with its own tgorgeous colors.
6. With all the visionary tfervor of his imagination, its
fondest dreams fell short of the reality. He died in ignorance
of the real grandeur of his discovery. Until his last breath,
he entertained the idea that he had merely opened a new way
to the old resorts of topulent commerce, and had discovered
some of the wild regions of the east. What visions of glory
would have broken upon his mind, could he have known that
he had indeed discovered a new continent, equal to the old
world in magnitude, and separated by two vast oceans, from
all the earth hitherto known by civilized man! How would
his magnanimous spirit have been consoled amid the afflictions
of age and the cares of tpenury, the neglect of a fickle public
and the injustice of an ungrateful king, could he have anticipated the splendid empires which would arise in the beautiful
world he had discovered; and the nations, and tongues, and
languages, which were to fill its land with his renown, and to
revere and bless his name to the latest posterity!CLXXL - SURRENDER OF GRENADA.+
FROM BULWER.
1. DAY dawned upon Grenada, and the beams of the winter
sun, smiling away the clouds of the past night, played
tcheerily upon the murmuring waves of the Xenil and the
Darro. Alone, upon a tbalcony, commanding a view of the
beautiful landscape, stood Boabdil, the last of the Moorish
kings. He had sought to bring to his aid all the lessons of
the philosophy, he had so ardently cultivated.
2. " What are we," said the musing prince, that we should
fill the earth with ourselves-we kings? Earth resounds
with the crash of my falling throne; on the ear of races
unborn the echo will live prolonged. But what have I lost?
Nothing that was necessary to my happiness, my repose:
nothing save the source of all my wretchedness, the Marah
of my life! Shall I less enjoy heaven and earth, or thought
and action, or man's' more material luxuries of food and
sleep-the common and cheap desires of all? At the worst,
I sink but to a level with chiefs and princes: I am but leveled
with those whom the multitude admire and envy.
But it is time to depart." So saying, he descended to the
court, flung himself on his barb, and, with a small and
saddened train, passed through the gate which we yet survey,
by a blackened and crumbling tower, overgrown with vines
and ivy; thence, amid gardens, now appertaining to the
convent of the tvictor faith, he took his mournful and
unnoticed way.
3. When he came to the middle of the hill that rises above
those gardens, the steel of the Spanish armor gleamed upon
him, as the +detachment sent to occupy the palace, marched
over the summit in steady order and profound silence.
At the head of the +vanguard, rode, upon a snow-white
tpalfrey, the Bishop of Avila, followed by a long train of
barefooted monks.  They halted as Boabdil approached,
and the grave bishop saluted him with the air of one who
addressed an +infidel and inferior. With the quick sense of
dignity common to the great, and yet more to the fallen,
Boabdil felt, but resented not the pride of the +ecclesiastic.
"Go, Christian," said he mildly, " the gates of the Alhambraare open, and Allah has bestowed the palace and the city
upon your king; may his virtues atone the faults of Boabdil!"
So saying, and waiting no answer, he rode on, without looking to the right or the left. The Spaniards also pursued their
Waly.
4. The sun had fairly risen above the mountains, when
Boabdil and his train beheld, from the eminence on which
they were, the whole +armament of Spain; and, at the same
moment, louder than the tramp of horse or the clash of
arms, was heard distinctly, the solemn chant of Te Deum,
which preceded the blaze of the unfurled and lofty standards.
Boabdil, himself still silent, heard the groans and tacclamations of his train; he turned to cheer or chide them, and
then saw, from his own watch-tower, with the sun shining
full upon its pure and dazzling surface, the silver cross of
Spain. His Alhambra was already in the hands of the foe;
while beside that badge of the holy war, waved the gay and
+flaunting flag of St. Jago, the tcanonized Mars of the chivalry
of Spain. At that sight, the King's voice died within him; he
gave the rein to his barb, impatient to close the fatal tceremonial, and slackened not his speed, till almost within bowshot- of the first rank of the army.
5. Never had Christian war assumed a more splendid and
imposing aspect. Far as the eye could reach, extended the
glittering and tgorgeous lines of that goodly power, bristling
with sun-lighted spears and blazoned banners; while beside,
murmured, and glowed, and danced, the silver and laughing
Xenil, careless what lord should possess, for his little day,
the banks that bloomed by its everlasting course. By a small
+mosque, halted the flower of the -army. Surrounded by the
arch-priests of that mighty +hierarchy, the peers and princes
of a court that +rivaled the Roland of Charlemagne, was seen
the kingly form of Ferdinand himself, with Isabel at his right
hand, and the high-born dames of Spain, relieving,'ith their
gay colors and sparkling gems, the sterner splendor of the
crested helmet and polished mail. Within sight of the royal
group, Boabdil halted, composed his aspect so as best to conceal his soul, and a little in advance of his scanty train, but
never in mien and majesty more a king, the son of Abdallah
met his haughty conqueror.NEW SIXTH READER.
6. At the sight of his -princely countenance and golden
hair, his comely and commanding beauty, made nore touching by youth, a thrill of compassionate admiration ran
through that assembly of the brave and fair.  Ferdinand
and Isabel slowly advanced to meet their late rival,--their
new subject; and as Boabdil- would have dismounted, the
Spanish king placed his hand upon his shoulder. "Brother
and prince," said he, "forget thy sorrows; and may our
friendship hereafter console thee for reverses against which
thou hast contended as a hero and a king; resisting man, but
resigned at length to God."
7. Boabdil did not affect to return this bitter, but unintentional mockery of compliment. He bowed his head, and remained a moment silent; then, motioning to his train, four
of his officers approached, and, kneeling beside Ferdinand,
proffered to him, upon a silver +buckler, the keys of the
city. "Oh, king!" then said Boabdil, " accept the keys of
the last hold which has resisted the arms of Spain! The
empire of the fMoslem is no more. Thine are the city and
the people of Grenada; yielding to thy tprowess, they yet
+confide in thy mercy."' They do well," said the king;
"our promises shall not be broken. But since we know the
gallantry of Moorish +cavaliers, not to us, but to gentler
hands, shall the keys of Grenada be surrendered."
8. Thus saying, Ferdinand gave the keys to Isabel, who
would have addressed some soothing flatteries to Boabdil,
but the emotion and excitement were too much for her
compassionate heart, heroine and queen though she was;
and when she lifted her eyes upon the calm and pale features
of thie fallen monarch, the tears gushed from them irresistibly,
and her voice died in murmurs. A faint flush overspread
the features of Boabdil, and there was a momentary pause of
embarrassment, which the Moor was the first to break.
9. "Fair queen," said he, with mournful and pathetic dignity, "thou canst read the heart that thy generous sympathy
touches and subdues; this is my last, but not least glorious
conquest. But I detain ye; let not my aspect cloud your
triumph. Suffer me to say farewell." " Farewell, my brother,"
replied Ferdinand, "and may fair fortune go with you!
Forget the past!"  Boabdil smiled bitterly, saluted the431
royal pair with profound respect and silent reverence, and
rode slowly on, leaving the army below, as he ascended the
path that led to his new +principality, beyond the Alpuxarras.
As the trees snatched the Moorish tcavalcade from the view
of the king, Ferdinand ordered the army to recommence its
march; and trumpet and cymbal presently sent their music
to the ear of the Moslem.
10. Boabdil spurred on, at full speed, till his panting
charger halted at the little village where his mother, his
slaves, and his faithful wife, Armine, (sent on before) awaited
him. Joining these, he proceeded without delay upon his
melancholy path. They ascended that eminence, which is the
pass into the Alpuxarras. From its hight, the vple, the rivers,
the spires, and the towers of Grenada, broke gloriously upon
the view of the little band. They halted +mechanically and
abruptly; every eye was turned to the beloved scene. The
proud shame of +baffled warriors, the tender memories of
home, of childhood, of fatherland, swelled every heart, and
gushed from every eye.
11. Suddenly, the distant boom of artillery broke from the
tcitadel, and rolled along the sun-lighted valley and crystal
river. An universal wail burst'from the exiles; it smote, it
overpowered the heart of the till-starred king, in vain seeking to wrap himself in the eastern pride, or tstoical philosophy.  The tears gushed from his eyes, and he +covered his
face with his hands. The band wound slowly on through the
solitary tdefiles; and that place, where the king wept at the
last view of his lost empire, is still called THE LAST SIGH
OF THE MOOR.
CLXXII.- THE LAST SIGH OF THE MOOR.
FROM MISS JEWSBURY.
THE Spaniards gave this name, ("The Last Sigh of the Moor,") to the
eminence from which, after their expulsion, the Moorish king and his followers took their farewell view of Grenada.
1. WINDING along, at break of day,
And arm'd with helm and spears,
Along the tmartyr's rocky way,
A king comes, with his peers;Unto the eye a splendid sight,
Making the air all richly bright,
Seen flashing through the trees;
But, to the heart, a scene of blight,
Sadder than death were these.
2. For brightly fall the morning rays
Upon a conquer'd king;
The breeze that with his tbanner plays,
Plays with an +abject thing.
Banner and king no more will know
Their rightful place mid friend and foe:
Proud +clarion, cease thy blast!
Or, changing to the wail of woe,
Breathe dirges for the past.
3. Along, along, by rock and tower,
That they have fail'd to keep,
By wood and vale, their fathers' dower,
The exiled warriors sweep:
The chevron'd* steed, no more +elate,
As if he knew his rider's fate,
Steps tlanguidly and slow,
As if he knew Grenada's gate,
Now open to the foe.
4. Along, along, till all is past,
That once they call'd their own,
Till bows the pride of strength at last,
And kniights, like women, tmoan.
Pausing upon the green hill-side,
That soon their city's towers will hide,
They lean upon their spears;
And hands, that late with blood were dyed,
Are now wash'd white with tears.
5. Another look, from brimming eyes,
Along the glorious plain;
Elsewhere may spread as lovely skies,
Elsewhere their monarch reign;
But never more in that bright land,
With all his chivalry at hand,
Now dead or far departed!
And from the hill-side moves the band,
The bravest, broken-hearted
* A ckehro is a oertain mark used in heraldry.CLXXIII.  THE MOON AND STARS-A FABLE.
FROM MONTGOMERY.
JAMES MONTGOMIERY, an English poet, is one of the most amiable
and pathetic of modern writers. Though he can not be ranked in the
first class of poets, he merits the praise of never having,written a line
that did not tend to the honor of God and the good of man.
1. ON the fourth day of creation, when the sun, after a
glorious, but solitary course, went down in the evening, and
darkness began to gather over the face of the uninhabited
globe, already tarrayed in the +exuberance of vegetation, and
prepared by the diversity of land and water, for the abode of
uncreated animals and man,-a star, single and beautiful,
stepped forth into the +firmament. Trembling with wonder
and delight in new-found existence, she looked abroad, and
beheld nothing in heaven or on earth resembling herself.
But she was not long alone; now one, then another, here a
third, and there a fourth +resplendent companion had joined
her, till light after light stealing through the gloom, in the
lapse of an hour the whole hemisphere was brilliantly +bespangled.
2. The planets and stars, with a tsuperb comet flaming in
the fzenith, for awhile contemplated themselves and each
other; and every one from the largest to the least, was so
perfectly well pleased with himself, that he imagined the rest
only partakers of his-felicity; he being the central tluminary
of his own universe, and all the hosts of heaven beside, displayed around him, in +graduated splendor.  Nor were any
undeceived in regard to themselves, though all saw their
associates in their real situations and relative proportions:self-knowledge being the last knowledge acquireIt either in
the sky or below it;-till bending over the ocean in their
turns, they discovered what they supposed at first to be a new
heaven, peopled with beings of their own species. But when
they perceived further, that no sooner had any one of their
company touched the horizon than he instantly disappeared;
they then recognized themselves in their individual forms,
reflected beneath according to their places and +configurations
above, from seeing others, whom they previously knew,
reflected in like manner.
37NEW SIXTH READER.
3. By an attentive but mournful self-examination in that
mirror, they slowly learned humility; but every one learned
it only for himself, none believing what others tinsinuated
respecting their own inferiority, till they reached the western
slope, from whence they could tidentify their true visages in
the tnether element. Nor was this very surprising; stars
being only visible points, without any distinction of limbs,
each was all eye; and though he could see others most cor
rectly, he could neither see himself nor any part of himself,
till he came to +reflection.  The comet, however, having a
long train of brightness, streaming sun-ward, could review
that, and did review it with +ineffable self-complacency. Indeed, after all pretensions to precedence, he was at length
acknowledged king of the +hemisphere, if not by the universal
assent, by the silent envy of all his rivals.
4. ]But the object which attracted most attention, and
astonishment too, was a slender thread of light that scarcely
could be discerned through the blush of evening, and vanished
soon after night fall, as if ashamed to appear in so scanty a
form, like an unfinished work of creation. It was the moon;
the first new moon. Timidly, she looked around upon the
glittering multitude that crowded the dark +serenity of space,
and filled it with life and beauty. Minute indeed they seemed
to her, but perfect in +symmetry, and formed to shine forever;
while she was unshapen, incomplete, and +evanescent. In
her humility, she was glad to hide herself from their keen
glances in the friendly bosom of the ocean, wishing for
immediate textinction.
5. When she was gone, the stars looked one at another with
inquisitive surprise, as much as to say, "What a figure!"  It
was so evident that they all thought alike, and thought contemptuously of the +apparition, (though at first they almost
doubted whether they should not be frightened,) that they
soon began to talk freely concerning her; of Course not with
audible accents, but in the language of intelligent sparkles, in
which stars are accustomed to converse with telegraphic +precision from  one end of heaven to the other, and which no
tdialect on earth so nearly resembles, as the language of the
eyes; the only one: probably, that has survived in its purity,
not only the confusion of Babel, but the revolutions of all435
ages. Her crooked form and her shyness, were ridiculed and
censured from pole to pole. For what purpose such a monster
could have been created, not the wisest could conjecture; yet,
to tell the truth, every one, though glad to be countenanced
in the affectation of scorn by the rest, had secret misgivings
concerning the stranger, and envied the delicate tbrilliancy
of her light,
6. All the gay company, however, quickly returned to the
admtiration of themselves, and the tinspection of each other.
Thus, the first night passed away. But, when the east began
to dawn, +consternation seized the whole army of tcelestials,
each feeling himself fainting into invisibility, and, as he
feared, into nothingness, while his neighbors were, one after
another, totally disappearing. At length, the sun arose, and
filled the heavens, and clothed the earth with his glory. How
he spent that day, belongs not to this history; but it is elsewhere recorded, that, for the first time from eternity, the lark,
on the wings of the morning, sprang up to salute him; the
eagle, at noon, looked undazzled on his splendor; and when
he went down beyond the deep, the leviathan was sporting
amid the multitude of waves.
CLXXIV. - THE MOON AND STARS - CONCLUDED.
1. IN the evening, the vanished tconstellations again gra.
dually awoke; and, on opening their eyes, were so rejoiced
at meeting together,-not one being wanting of last night's
levee,-that they were in the highest good humor with themselves and one another. Decked in all their beams, and
darting their *benignest influence, they exchanged smiles and
endearments, and made vows of affection, eternal and unchangeable; while, fromn this nether orb, the song of the
nightingale arose out of darkness, and charmed even the stars
in their courses, being the first sound, except the roar of the
ocean, that they had ever heard. " The music of the spheres"
may be traced to the rapture of that hour.
2. The little, gleaming horn was again discerned, leaning
backward over the western hills. This companionless +lumifEXAMPLES.

There is another case, in which we discover the reason for
changing the accent, and that is, when it is required by emphasis, as in the following
EXAMPLES.
His abil'ity or in'ability to perform the act, materially varies
the case.
This corrupp'tion must put on in'corruption.
In words of more than two syllables, there is often a second
accent given, but more slightly than the principal one, and
this is called the secondary accent; as, car "avan', rep artee'",
where the principal accent is marked (..) and the secondary,
('); so, also, this accent is obvious, in nav'iga"tion, com'prehen'-sion, planw'si bil"ity, &amp;c.  This whole subject, however, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling-books.
ON  EMPHASIS.
EMPHASIS consists in a certain manner of uttering a
word or phrase, designed to give it force and energy,
and to draw the attention of the hearer, particularly,
to the idea thereby expressed.
This is most frequently accomplished by an increased stress
of voice laid upon the word or phrase. Sometimes, though
more rarely, the same object is effected by an unusual lowering of the voice, even down to a whisper.
The inflections, also, are made subsidiary to this object. To
give emphasis to a word, the inflection is often changed or increased in force or extent. Where the rising inflection is
ordinarily used, the word, when emphatic, frequently takes the
falling inflection; and sometimes, also, the falling inflection is
changed into the rising, for the same purpose.
Emphatic words are often denoted by being written in
italics, or in SMALL, or in LARGE CAPITALS.NEW SIXTH READER.
nary, they thought-but they must be mistaken-it could not
be--and yet they were afraid that it was so--appeared somewhat larger than on the former occasion. But the moon, still
only venturing to glance at this scene of tmagnificence,
escaped beneath the horizon, leaving the comet in proud
possession of the sky.
3. On the third evening, the moon was so obviously increased in size and splendor, and stood so much higher in the
firmament than at first, though she still hastened out of sight,
that she was the sole subject of conversation on both sides of
the tgalaxy, till the breeze, that awakened newly-created man
from his first slumber in paradise, warned the stars to retire;
and the sun, with a pomp never witnessed in our degenerate
days, tushered in the great Sabbath of creation, when "the
heaven and the earth were finished, and all the hosts of them."
4. The following night, the moon took her station still
higher, and looked brighter than before.  Still, however, she
preserved her humility and shame-facedness, till her tcrescent
had exceeded the first quarter. Hitherto, she had only grown
lovelier, but now she grew prouder at every step of her tpreferment. Her rays, too, became so intolerably dazzling, that
fewer and fewer of the stars could endure her presence, but
shrouded themselves in her light as behind a vail. When
she verged to tmaturity, the heavens seemed too small for her
ambition.  She " rose in clouded majesty," but the clouds
melted at her approach, or spread their rich and rainbowtinted garments in her path.
5. She had crossed the comet in her course, and left him as
wan as a vapor behind her. On the night of her fulness, she
triumphed gloriously in mid-heaven, smiled on the earth, and
arrayed it in a softer day; for she had repeatedly seen the
sun, and though she could not rival him when he was above
the horizon, she fondly hoped to make his.absence forgotten.
Over the ocean she hung, +enamored of her own beauty reflected in the abyss. The few stars that still could stand amid
her overpowering +effulgence, tconverged their rays, and
shrunk into bluer depths of +ether, to gaze at a safe distance'
upon her. "V What more can she be?" thought these scattered
survivors of myriads of extinguished sparklers: " as hitherto
she has increased every evening, to-morrow she will do thesame; and we must be lost, like our brethren, in her allconquering tresplendence."
6. The moon herself was not a little puzzled to imagine
what might become of her; but vanity readily suggested, that
although she had reached her full form, she had not reached
her full size; consequently, by a regular nightly expansion
of circumference, she would finally cover the whole +convexity
of the sky, not only to the exclusion of stars, but of the sun
himself, since he occupied a superior region of space, and certainly could not shine through her; till man and his beautiful companion woman, looking upward from the bowers of
Eden, would see all moon above them, and walk in the light
of her countenance forever.
7. In the midst of this pleasing self-illusion, a +film crept
upon her, which spread from her utmost verge, athwart her
center, till it had completely teclipsed her visage, and made
her a blot on the tablet of the heavens. In the progress of
this disaster, the stars, which were hid in her pomp, stole
forth to witness her humiliation. But their transport and her
shame, lasted not long; the shadow retired as gradually as it
had advanced, leaving her fairer by contrast than before.
Soon afterward, the day broke, and she withdrew, marveling
what would next befall her.
8. Never had the stars been more impatient to resume their
places, nor the moon more impatient to rise, than on the following evening. With trembling hope and fear, the planets
that came out first after sunset, espied her disk, broad and
dark red, emerging from a gulf of clouds in the east. At the
first glance, their keen, celestial sight discovered that her western limb was a little contracted, and her orb no longer perfect. She herself was too much elated to suspect any failing,
and fondly imagined that she had continued to increase all
around, till she had got above the Pacific; but even then, she
was only chagrined to perceive, that her image was no larger
than it had been last night. There was not a star in the
thoroscope - no, not the comet himself- durst tell her she
was less.
9. Another day went, and another night came. She rose
as usual, a little later. Even while she traveled above the
land, she was haunted with the idea, that her luster was ratherNEW SIXTH READER.
feebler than it had been; but when she beheld her face in the
sea, she could no longer overlook the unwelcome defect. The
season was boisterous; the wind rose suddenly, and the waves
burst into foam; perhaps the tide, for the first time, was then
affected by sympathy with the moon; and what had never happened before, an universal tempest mingled heaven and earth
in rain, and lightning, and darkness. She plunged among
the thickest of the thunder-clouds, and in the confusion that
hid her disgrace, her fexulting rivals were all likewise put
out of countenance.
10. On the next evening, and every evening afterward, thQ
moon came forth later, and less, and dimmer; while on elch
occasion, more and more of the minor stars, which had formerly vanished from  her eye, re-appeared to witness her
fading honors and disfigured form. Prosperity had made her
vain; adversity brought her to her mind again, and humility
soon +compensated the loss of glaring distinction, with softer
charms, which won the regard which haughtiness had repelled;
for when she had worn off her uncouth +gibbous aspect, and
through the last quarter, her profile +waned into a hollow shell,
she appeared more- graceful than ever in the eyes of all heaven.
11. When she was originally seen among them, the stars
contemned her; afterward, as she grew in beauty, they envied,
feared, hated, and finally fled from her. As she trelapsed
into insignificance, they first rejoiced in her decay, and then
endured her superiority, because it could not last long; but
when they marked how she had wasted away every time they
met, compassion succeeded, and, on the last three nights, (like
a human fair one, in the latest stages of decline, growing lovelier and dearer to her friends till the close,) she disarmed hostility, tconciliated kindness, and secured affection.  She was
admired, beloved, and unenvied by all.
12. At length there came a night when there was no moon.
There was silence in heaven all that night. In serene meditation on the changes of the month, the stars pursued their
journey from sunset to day-break.  The comet had, likewise,
departed into unknown regions.  His fading luster had
been attributed, at first, to the bolder radiance of the moon
in her +meridian; but, during the wane, while inferior luminaries were brightening around her, he was growing fainter439
and smaller every evening, and now, he was no more.  Of
the rest, planets and stars, all were unimpaired in their
light, and the former only slightly varied in their positions.
The whole multitude, wiser by experience, and better for their
knowledge, were humble, contented, and grateful, each for his
lot, whether splendid or obscure.
13. Next evening, to the joy and astonishment of all, the
moon, with a new crescent, was descried in the west; and
instantly, from every quarter of the heavens, she was congratulated on her happy resurrection. Just as she went down,
while her bow was yet trecumbent in the dark purple thorizon,
it is said that an angel appeared, standing between her horns.
Turning his head, his eye glanced rapidly over the universe;
the sun far sunk behind him, the moon under his feet, the
earth spread in prospect before him, and the firmament all
glittering with constellations above.  He paused a moment,
and then in that tongue, wherein, at the +accomplishinent of
creation,' the morning stars sang together, and all the sons
of God shouted for joy," he thus brake forth: "Great and
marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty! In wisdom
hast thou made them all. Who would not fear thee, O Lord,
and glorify thy name, for thou only art holy!" He ceased;
and from that hour there has been harmony in heaven.
CLXXV. - THUNDER-STORM ON THE ALPS.
FKOM BYRON.
1. CLEAR, placid Leman! thy tcontrasted lake,
With the wide world I dwell in, is a thing
Which warns me with its stillness, to forsake
Earth's troubled waters for a purer spring.
This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing
To waft me from +distractions; once I lov'd
Torn ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring
Sounds sweet, as if a sister's voice reproved,
That I with stern delight should e'er have been so moved.
2. All heaven and earth are still; though not in sleep,
But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;
And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep:All heaven and earth are still: from the high host
Of stars, to the tlull'd lake and mountain-coast,
All is +concenter'd in a life intense,
Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,
But hath a part of being, and a sense
Of that which is of all, creator and defense.
3. The sky is changed! and such a change! O night,
And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong!
Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light
Of a dark eye in woman! Far along,
From peak to peak, the rattling tcrags among,
Leaps the live thunder! -not from one lone cloud,
But every mountain now hath found a tongue;
And Julra answers from her +misty shroud,
Back to the joyous Alps, which call to her aloud!
4. And this is in the night.-Most gloriouls nighlt!
Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be
A sharer in thy fierce and far delight;
A portion of the tempest and of thee!
How the lit lake shines! - a tphosphoric sea!
And the big rain comes dahcing to the earth!
And now again,'t is black; and now, the glee
Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain mirth,
As if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth.
5. Now, where the swift +Rhone +cleaves his way between
Hights, which appear as lovers who have parted
In hate, whose tmining depths so +intervene,
That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;
Though in their souls, which thus each other tthwarted,
Love was the very root of the fond rage,
Which blighted their life's bloom, and then-departed!Itself expired, but leaving them an age
Of years, all winters -war within themselves to wage;
6. Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,
The mightiest of the storms has ta'en his stand!
For here, not one, but many make their play,
And fling their thunder-bolts from hand to hand,
Flashing, and cast around! Of all the band,
The brightest through these parted hills hath fork'd
His lightnings- as if he did understand,
That in such gaps as tdesolation work'd,
There, the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurk'd.

CLXXVI. -- THE MANIAC.
FROM LEWIS.
IT is said, that a gentleman in England, in order to gain possession of his
wife's property, confined her in a mad-house, under pretense of insanity,
until she became really a maniac.
1. STAY, jailer, stay, and hear my woe!
She is not mad who kneels to thee;
For what I'm now, too well I know,
And what I was, and what should be.
I'11 rave no more in proud despair;
My language shall be mild, though sad:
But yet I'll firmly, truly swear,
I am not mad; I am not mad.
2. My tyrant husband forged the tale,
Which chains me in this dismal cell;
My fate unknown my friends bewail;
Oh! jailer, haste that fate to tell;
Oh! haste my father's heart to cheer:
His heart at once'twill grieve and glad
To know, though kept a captive here,
I am not mad; I am not mad.
3. He smiles in scorn, and turns the key;
He quits the grate; I knelt in vain;
His glimmering lamp, still, still I see;'T is gone, and all is gloom again:
Cold! bitter cold! no warmth! no.light!
Life, all thy comforts once I had;
Yet here I'm chain'd, this freezing night,
Although not mad; no, no, not mad.
4.'T is sure some dream, some vision vain;
What! I,- the child of rank and wealth?
Am I the wretch who clanks this chain,
Bereft of freedom, friends, and health?
Ah! while I dwell on blessings fled,
Which never more my heart must glad,
Ilow aches my heart, how burns my head;
But't is not mad; no,'t is not mad.
5. Hast thou, my child, forgot, ere this,
A mother's face, a mother's tongue?
She'll ne'er forget your parting kiss,
Nor round her neck how fast you clung;NEW SIXTH READER.
Nor how with me you sued to stay;
Nor how that suit your sire forbade;
Nor how --I'll drive such thoughts away;
They'll make me mad; they'll make me mad.
6. IIis rosy lips, how sweet they smiled!
His mild, blue eyes, how bright they shone!
None ever bore a lovelier child:
And art thou now forever gone?
And must I never see thee more,
My pretty, pretty, pretty lad?
I will be free! unbar the door!
I am not mad; I am not mad.
7. Oh! hark! what mean those yells and cries?
His chain some furious madman breaks;
lIe comes; I see his glaring eyes;
Now, now my dungeon grate he shakes.
Help! help! He's gone! Oh! fearful woe,
Such screams to hear, such sights to see!
My brain, my brain, --I know, I know,
I am not mad, but soon shall be.
8. Yes, soon; - for, lo you! - while I speak,
Mark how yon Demon's eye-balls glare!
He sees me; now, with dreadful shriek,
lie whirls a serpent high in air.
Horror  - the reptile strikes his tooth
Deep in my heart, so crush'd and sad;
Ay, laugh, ye fiends;- I feel the truth;
Your task is done! -I'm  mad! P m mad I
CLXXVII. - IMPORTANCE OF THE UNION.
FRoM WEBSTER.
1. MR. PRESIDENT. I am conscious of having detained you
and the senate much too long.  I was drawn into the debate
with no previous +deliberation, such as is suited to the
discussion of so grave and important a subject. But it is a
subject of which my heart is full, and I have not been willing
to suppress the ttterance of its tspontaneous sentiments.  I
can not, even now, persuade myself to relinquish it, without
expressing once mere, my deep conviction, that, since itrespects nothing less than the union of the states, it is of
most vvital and +essential importance to the public happiness.
2. I profess, sir, in my icareer hitherto, to have kept
steadily in view the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the preservation of our federal union. It is to that
union we owe our safety at home, and our consideration and
dignity abroad.  It is to that union, that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us- most proud of our country.
That union we reached only by the discipline of our virtues,
in the severe school of adversity. It had its origin in the
necessities of disordered +finance, +prostrate commerce, and
ruined credit. Under its +benign influences, these great interests immediately awoke as from the dead, and sprang forth
with newness of life. Every year of its duration has teeme'd
with fresh proof of its utility and its blessings; and, although
our territory has stretched out wider and wider, and our population spread further and further, they have not out-run its
protection or its benefits. It has been to us all a copious
fountain of national, social, and personal happiness.
3. I have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the union,
to see what might lie hidden in the dark +recess behind. I
have not coolly weighed the chances of preserving liberty,
when the bonds that unite us together shall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself to hang over the precipice of +disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I can
fathom the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe
+coiunsellor in the affairs of the government, whose thoughts
should be mainly bent on considering, not how the union
might best be preserved, but how tolerable might be the condition of the people, when it shall be broken up and destroyed.
4. While the union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects spread out before us, for us and our children.
Beyond that, I seek not to penetrate the vail.  God grant,
that in my day, at least, that curtain may not rise.  God
grant, that on my vision never may be opened what lies behind. When my eyes shall be turned to behold, for the last
time, the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the
broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious union;
on states +dissevered, +discordant, tbelligerent; our land rent
with civil +feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood.NEW SIXTH READER.
5. Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold
the fgorgeous "ensign of the Republic, now known and honored throughout the earth, still full high advanced, its arms
and trophies streaming in their original luster, not a stripe
+erased or polluted, not a single star obscured, bearing, for
its motto, no such miserable interrogatory as, What is all this
worth? nor those other words of delusion and folly, Liberty
first, and union afterward; but every where, spread all over,
in characters of living light, blazing on all its ample folds,
as they float over the sea, and over the land, and on every
wind, and under the whole heavens, that other sentiment, dear
to every true American heart-Liberty AND Union, now and
forever: one and inseparable I
CLXXVIII. -CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.
FROM J. SPARKS.
1. THE person of Washington was commanding, graceful,
and fitly proportioned; his tstature six feet, his chest broad
and full, his limbs long and somewhat slender, but well
shaped and muscular. His features were regular and symmetrical, his eyes of a light blue color, and his whole countenance, in its quiet state, was grave, placid, and tbenignant.
When alone, or not engaged in conversation, he appeared
sedate and thoughtful; but when his attention was excited,
his eye kindled quickly, and his face beamed with animation
and intelligence.
2. He was not +fluent in speech, but what he said was +apposite, and listened to with the more interest as being known
to come from the heart. He seldom attempted tsallies of wit
or humor, but no man received more pleasure from an exhibition of them by others; and, although contented in +seclusion, he sought his chief happiness in society, and participated with delight in all its +rational and innocent amusements. Without +austerity on the one hand, or an appearance of condescending familiarity on the other, he was taffable, courteous, and cheerful; but it has often been remarked,
that there was a dignity in his person and manner not easy
to be +defined, which impressed every one that saw him for445
the first time, with an instinctive deference and awe. This
may have arisen, in part, from a conviction of his superiority,
as well as from the effcct produced by his external form and
deportment.
3. The character of his mind was unfolded in the public
and private acts of his life; and the proofs of his greatness
are seen almost as much in the one as in the other. The
same qualities which raised him to the tascendency he possessed over the will of a nation, as the commander of armies
and chief magistrate, caused him to be loved and respected
as an individual.  Wisdom, judgment, prudence, and firmness, were his tpredominant traits. No man ever saw more
clearly the relative importance of things and actions, or divested himself more entirely of the bias of personal interest,
partiality, and prejudice, in discriminating between the true
-and the false, the right and the wrong, in all questions and
subjects that were presented to him. He +deliberated slowly,
but decided surely; and when his decision was once formed,
hle seldom reversed it, and never relaxed from the execution
of a measure till it was completed. Courage, +physical and
+moral, was a part of his nature; and, whether in battle, or
in the midst of popular excitement, he was fearless of danger,
and regardless of consequences to himself.
4. His ambition was of that noble kind, which aims to excel
in whatever it undertakes and to acquire a power over the
hearts of men by promoting their happiness and winning their
affections. Sensitive to the approbation of others, and solicitous to deserve it, he made no concession to gain their applause, either by flattering their vanity, or yielding to their
tcaprices. Cautious without timidity, bold without rashness,
cool in counsel, deliberate but firm in action, clear in foresight,
patient under +reverses, steady, persevering, and self-possessed,
he met and conquered every obstacle that obstructed his path
to honor, renown, and success. More confident in the uprightness of his intention, than in his resources, he sought knowledge and advice from other men. He chose his counselors
with unerring +sagacity; and his quick perception of the
soundness of an opinion, and of the strong points in an argument, enabled him to draw to his aid the best fruits of their
talents, and the light of their collected wisdom.41
ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.
Where the emphasis is independent of any contrast
or comparison with other words or ideas, it is called
absolute emphasis.
EXAMPLES.
1. We praise thee, 0 God; we- acknowledge thee to be the Lord.
2. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll.
3. Arm, warriors, arm!
4. You know that you are Brutus, that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
5. Hamlet. Saw who?
fforatio. The king, your father.
Hamlet. The king, my father?
6.            The game's afoot;
Follow upon your spirit, and upon this charge,
Cry " God for Harry, England, and St. George."
7. She was the rainbow to thy sight,
Thy sun, thy heaven of lost delight.
8. The old Lion of England grows youthful again:
He rouses-he rises-he bristles his mane.
9.    Strike-till the last armed foe expires,
Strike-for your altars and your fires,
Strike-for the green graves of your sires,
God-and your native land.
RELATIVE EMPHASIS.
Where there is antithesis, either expressed or implied,
the emphasis is called relative.
EXAMPLES.
1. We can do nothing against the truth, butfor the truth.
2. But I am describing your condition, rather than my own.
3. I fear not death, and shall I then fear thee?
4. Hunting men, and not beasts, shall be his game.
5. He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but
for the sins of the whole world.
6. It may moderate and restrain, but was not designed to banish,
gladness from the heart of man.
4NEW SIXTH READER.
5. His moral qualities were in perfect harmony with those
of his intellect. Duty was the ruling, principle of his conduct;
and the rare endowments of his understanding were not more
constantly tasked to devise the best methods of effecting an
object, than they were to guard the tsanctity of conscience.
No instance can be adduced, in which he was actuated by a
+sinister motive, or endeavored to attain an end by unworthy
means.  Truth, integrity, and justice, were deeply rooted in
Ihis mind; and nothing could rouse his indignation so soon,
or so utterly destroy his confidence, as the discovery of the
want of these virtues in any one whom he had trusted.
Weaknesses, follies, indiscretions he could'forgive; but +subterfuge and dishonesty he never forgot, rarely pardoned.
6. He was candid and sincere, true to his friends, and faithful to all, neither practicing tdissimulation, descending to
+artifice, nor holding out expectations which he did not intend
should be realized.  His passions were strong, and sometimes
they broke out with tvehemence: but he had the power of
checking them  in an instant.  Perhaps self-control was the
most remarkable trait of his character.  It was, in part, the
effect of discipline; yet he seems by nature to have possessed
this power to a degree which has been denied to other men.
7. A Christian in faith and practice, he was habitually
devout.  His reverence for religion is seen in his example,
his public communications, and his private writings.  He
uniformly ascribed his successes to the +beneficent +agency of
the Supreme Being.  Charitable and humane, he was liberal
to the poor, and kind to those in distress. As a husband,
son, and brother, he was tender and affectionate. Without
vanity, +ostentation, or pride, he never spoke of himself or
his actions, unless required by circumstances which concerned
the public interests.
8. As he was free from  envy, so he had the good fortune
to escape the envy of others, by standing on an +elevation
which none could hope to attain. If he had one passion
more powerful than another, it was love of his country.  The
purity and ardor of his patriotism were +commensurate with
the greatness of its object. Love of country in him was invested with the sacred obligation of a duty; and from the
faithful discharge of this duty he never swerved for a moment,447
either in thought or deed, through the whole period of his
eventful career.
9. Such are some of the traits in the character of Washington, which have acquired for him the love and veneration
of mankind.  If they are not marked with the +-brilliancy,
extravagance, and +eccentricity, which, in other men,- have
excited the astonishment of the world, so neither are they
ttarnished by the follies, nor disgraced by the crimes of those
men. It is the happy combination of rare talents and qualities, the +harmonious union of the intellectual and moral
powers, rather than the dazzling splendor of any one trait,
which constitute the +grandeur of his character.  If the
title of great man ought to be reserved for him who can not
be charged with an +indiscretion or a vice; who spent his life
in establishling the independence, the glory, and durable
prosperity of his country; who succeeded in all that he undertook; and whose successes were never won at the expense of
honor, justice, integrity, or by the sacrifice of a single principle,-this title will not be denied to WASHINGTON.
THE MOTHER OF WASHINGTON.
Methinks we see thee, as in olden time,
Simple in garb, +majestic and serene,
Unmoved by pomp or circumstance, in truth
tInflexible, and, with a Spartan zeal
tRepressing vice, and making folly grave.
Thou didst not deem it woman's part to waste
Life in +inglorious sloth; to sport awhile
Amid the flowers, or on the summer wave,
Then fleet, like the +ephemeron, awavy,
Building no temple in her children's hearts,
Save to the vanity and pride of life
Which she had worshipp'd. For the might that clothed
Ilis " Country's Father," for the glorious deeds
That make Mount Vernon's tomb a Mecca shrine
For all the earth, what thanks to thee are due.

We know not: Heaven can tell.NEW SIXTH READER.
CLXXIX.- THE VICTOR'S CROWN.
FROM MRS. HALE.
1. A CROWN for the victor! a crown of light!
From the land where the flowers ne'er feel a blight
Was gather'd the wreath that around it blows:
And he who o'ercometh his treacherous foes,
That fadeless crown shall gain.
A king went forth on the rebel array,
Intrench'd where a lovely hamlet lay
tie frown'd,-and there's naught save ashes and blood,
And blacken'd bones, where that hamlet stood;
Yet his treacherous foes he hath not slain.
2. A crown for the victor! a crown of light!
Encircled with jewels so pure and bright.
Night never hath gloom'd where its luster flows:
And he who can conquer his proudest foes,
That glorious crown shall gain.
A hero came from the gory field,
And low at his feet the captives kneel'd;
In his might he hath trodden a nation down,
But he may not challenge that glorions crown,
For his proudest foes he hath not slain.
3. A crown for the victor I a crown of light!
Like the morning sun to the dazzled sight,
From the night of a dungeon rais'd, it glows;
And he who can slay his deadliest foes,
That shining crown shall gain.
With searching eye and stealthy tread,
The man of wrath sought his enemy's bed:
Like festering wounds are the wrongs he hath borne;
And he takes the revenge his soul hath'sworn;
But his deadliest foe he hath not slain.
4. A crown for the victor! a crown of light!
To be worn with a robe whose spotless white
Makes darkness seem resting on Alpine snows;
And he who o'ercometh his mightiest foes,
That robe and crown shall gain.
With eye uprais'd, and forehead bare,
A pilgrim knelt down in holy prayer:
He hath wrestled with SELF, and with passion striven;
And to him hath the Sword of the Spirit been given;Oh! crown him! for his foes,-his sins,-are slain.THE

EMPHASIS AND INFLECTION.
Emphasis sometimes changes the inflection from the
rising to the falling, or from the falling to the rising.
For instances of the former change, see Rule II. and
exception to Rule IV.  In the first three following examples, the inflection is changed from the rising to the
falling inflection; in the last three, it is changed from
the falling to the rising, by the influence of emphasis.
EXAMPLES.   a
1. If we have no regard for religion in youths, we ought to have
respect for it in age.
2. If we have no regard for our own' character, we ought to
regard the character of others.
3. If content can not remove' the disquietudes of life, it will, at
least, alleviate them.
4. The sweetest melody and the most perfect harmony, fall
powerless upon the ear of one who is deaf,'.
5. It is useless to expatiate upon the beauties of nature to one

6. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise
them, because they are brethren'; but rather let them do them
service.
EMPHATIC PHRASE.
When it is desired to give to a phrase great force of
expression, each word, and even the parts of a compound word are independently emphasized.EXAMPLES.
1. Cassius. Must I endure all this?
Brutus. All this!-Ay,-more. Fret, till your proud-hleart
break.
2.        What! weep you, when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look ye here  
Here is him-selJf
3. There was a time, my fellow-citizens, when the Lacedaemonians were sovereign masters, both by sea and by land; while this
state had not one ship-no, NOT--ONE-WALL.
4. Shall I, the conqueror of Sjain and Gaul; and not only of
the Alpine nations, but of the Alps themselves; shall I compare
myself with this HALF--YEAR-CAPTAIN?
5. You call me misbeliever-cut-throat--dog.
Hath a dog-money? Is it possibleA cur can lend three-thousand-ducats?
EMPHATIC PAUSE.
A short pause is often made before or after, and sometimes both before and after an emphatic word or phrase,
thus very much increasing the emphatic expression of the
thought.
EXAMPLES.
1. May one be pardoned, and retain-the offense?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offense's gilded hand may shove by--justice;
And oft'tis seen, the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law: but't is not so-above:
There-is no shuffling: there-the action lies
In its true nature.

IV. INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING VERSE.
INFLECTIONS.
IN reading verse, the inflections should be nearly the
same as in reading prose; the chief difference is, that
in poetry, the monotone and rising inflection are more
frequently used than in prose. The greatest difficulty
in reading or declaiming this species of composition,
consists in giving it that measured flow which distinguishes it from prose, without falling into a chanting
pronunciation.
If, at any time, the reader is in doubt as to the proper inflection, let him reduce the passage to earnest conversation,
and pronounce it in the most familiar and prosaic manner,
and thus he will generally use the proper inflection.
EXERCISES IN INFLECTIONS.
1. Meanwhile the south wind rose, and with black wings
Wide hovering", all the clouds together drove
From under heaven": the hills to their supply',
Vapor and exhalation dusk and moist
Sent up amain": and now, the thickened skyTHE ECLECTIC EDUCATIONAL SERIES

ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.
IN reading verse, every syllable must have the same
accent, and every word the same emphasis as in prose;
and whenever the melody or music of the verse would
lead to an incorrect accent or emphasis, this must be
disregarded.
If a poet has made his verse deficient in melody, this must
not be remedied by the reader, at the expense of sense or the
established rules of accent and quantity.  Take the following47
EXAMPLE.
O'er shields, and helms, and helm-ed heads he rode,
Of thrones, and mighty Seraphim prostrate.
According to the metrical accent, the last word must be pronounced " prostrate'." But according to the authorized pronunciation it is "pros'trate." Which shall yield, the poet, or
established usage? Certainly not the latter.
Some writers advise a compromise of the matter, and that
the word should be pronounced without accenting either syllable. Sometimes this may be done, but where it is not practicable, the prosaic reading should be preserved.
In the following examples, the words and syllables which
are zpnroperly accented or emphasized in the poetry, are
marked in italics.  According to the principle stated above,
the reader should avoid giving them that' r6onunciation which
the correct reading of the poetry would require, but should
read them as prose, except where he can throw off all accent,
and thus compromise the conflict between the poetic reading'
and the correct reading.  That is, he must read the poetry
wrong, in order to read the language right.
EXAMPLES.
1. Ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made
Taller and stronger than the weeds they shade.
2. Their praise is still, " the style is excellent,"
The sense they humbly take upon content.
3. False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,
Its fairy colors spreads on every place.
4. To do aught good, never will be our task,
But ever to do ill our sole delight.
5. Of all the causes which combine to blind
Man's erring judgment, and mislead the mind,
What the weak head with strongest bias rules,
Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.
6. Eye nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies,
And catch the manners living as they rise.
7. To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied,
"Is this thy love, is this the reconlpense
Of mine to thee, ungrateful Eve?"8. We may, with more successful hope, resolve
To wage, by force or guile, successful war,
Irreconcilable to our grand foe,
Who now triumphs, and in excess of joy
Sole reigning, holds the tyranny of Heaven.
9. Which, when Beelzebub perceived, (than whom,
Satan except, none higher sat,) with grave
Aspect, he rose, and in his rising seemed
A pillar of state.
10. Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,
That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget
Those other two, equaled with me in fate.
NOTE.-The principle which has been stated and exemplified in the
preceding examples, admits of a few exceptions; but as they can not
be classified in such a way as to furnish a safe guide to any but practiced readers, the rule has been laid down as one without exception.
Those who are desirous of pursuing the examination of the subject
further, and to see the exceptions reduced to the form of rules, may
consult Walker's Rhetorical Grammar, pp. 164-5-6-7.
OF POETIC PAUSES.
In order to make the measure of poetry perceptible
to the ear, there should generally be a slight pause at
the end of each line, even where the sense does not
require it.
There is, also, in almost every line of poetry, a pause
at or near its middle, which is called the Cesura.
This should, however, never be so placed as to injure the
sense of the passage. It is indeed reckoned a great beauty,
where it naturally coincides with the pause required by the
sense. The cesura, though generally placed near the middle,
may be placed at other intervals.
There are sometimes also two additional pauses in
each line, called demi-cesuras.
The cesura is marked (11), and the demi-cesura thus
( I ), in the examples given.
There is also to be observed a marked accent upon the long
4849
syllable next preceding the cesura, and a slighter one upon
that next before each of the demi-cesuras.  These pauses and
accents constitute chiefly the melody of poetry.  When made
too prominent, however, theylead to a sing-song style, which
should be carefully avoided.
In the following examples the cesura is marked in each line,
the demi-cesura in a few cases only.
EXAMPLES.
1. Nature I to all things 1i fixed I the limits fit,
And wisely I curbed 11 proud man's I pretending wit.
2. So when an angel 11 by divine command,
With rising tempests 1I shakes a guilty land.
3. Then from his closing eyes 11 thy form shall part,
And the last pang {{ shall tear thee from his heart.
4. Know then thyself; Ii presume not God to scan;
The proper study 11 of mankind is man.
5. There is a land 11 of every land the pride,
Beloved by Heaven 11 o'er all the world beside,
Where brighter scenes 11 dispense serener light,
And milder moons jf imparadise the night;
Oh, thou shalt find, bl howe'er thy footsteps roam,
That land-thy country II and that spot-thy home.
6. In slumbers I of midnight 1I the sailor I boy lay,
His hammock I swung loose II at the sport of the wind,
But watch-worn I and weary I! his cares I flew away,
And visions I of happiness 11 danced I o'er his mind.
7. You may as well 1H go stand ulpon the beach,
And bid the main-flood 1i bate his usual hight;
You may as well II use questions with the wolf,
WVhy he hath made i] the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You nmay as well {1 forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops, i1 and to make no noise,
When they are fretted II with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well II do any thing that's hard,
As seek to soften II that, (than which, what's harder?)
His Jewish heart.
8. She said 1 and struck; 11 deep entered I in her side
The piercing steel, 11 with reeking purple dyed:
5Clogged I in the wound, [i the cruel I weapon stands,
The spouting blood II came streaming o'er her hands.
Iler sad attendants II saw the deadly stroke,
And with loud cries 1I the sounding palace shook.
SIMILE.
A Simile, in poetry, should be read in a lower tone
of voice, than other parts of the passage.
EXAMPLES.
(The Similes are put in Italics.)
1. Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal
With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form.
As when, to warn proud cities, war appears
Wag'd in the troubled sky, and armies rush
To battle in the clouds.--
Others with vast Typhean rage more fell,
Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air
In whirlwind. Hell scarce holds the wild uproar.
As when Alcides    -
---felt the envenomed robe, and tore
Through pain, up by the roots, Thessalian pines,
And Lichas from the top of (Eta threw
Into the Euboic sea.
2.                     Each at the head,
Leveled his deadly aim; their fatal hands
No second stroke intend; and such a frown
Each cast at th' other, as when two black clouds,
With heaven's artillery fiaught, come rolling on
Over the Caspian, there stand front to front,
Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow
To join the dark encounter, in mid-air:
So frowned the mighty combatants.
3. Then pleased and thankful, from the porch they go,
And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe:
The cup had vanished; for, in secret guise,
The younger guest purloined the glittering prize.
As one who spies a serpent in his way,
Glistening and basking in the summer ray,
Disordered, stops to shun the danger near,
Then walks with faintness on, and looks wvith fear,So seemed the sire, when fiEst upon the road,
The shining spoil his wily partner showed.
QUESTIONs.--What is the difference between the inflection proper
in prose and in verske? What is the principal difficulty in reading
poetry correctly? How may this difficulty be overcome? If there
should be doubt as to the proper inflection, how may the inflection
be determined? If the poetical accent or emphasis conflicts with the
common and authorized pronunciation, which should yield?  How
may the difficulty sometimes be compromised? Illustrate this by
examples.  What pauses are peculiar to pQetry?  What caution
should be observed with regard to the cesura? How should a simile
be read in poetry?
V. THE VOICE.
STRENGTH AND COMPASS.
THE first object of every speaker's attention, is to have a
smooth, even, full tone of voice. If nature has not given
him  such a voice, he must endeavor, as much as possible, to
acquire it; nor ought he to despair; for such is the force of
exercise upon the organs of speech, that constant practice will
strengthen the voice in any key to which we accustom it.
That key, therefore, which is most natural, and which we
have the greatest occasion to use, should be the key we ought
the most diligently to improve.
Every one has a certain pitch of voice in which he can
speak most easily to himself and most agreeably to others; this
may be called the natural pitch; this is the pitch in which
we converse; and this must be the basis of every improvement
we acquire from  art and exercise.  In order, therefore, to
strengthen this middle tone, we ought to read and speak in
it, as loud as possible, without suffering the voice to rise into
a higher key. This, however, is no easy operation. It is
not very difficult to be loud in a high tone, but to be loud
and forcible without raising the voice into a higher key,
requires great practice and management.
The best method of acquiring this power of voice, is to
practice reading and speaking some strong, animated passages, in a small room, and to persons placed at as small aON THE VOICE.
distance as possible; for, as'we naturally raise our voice to a
higher key, when we speak to people at a great distance, so
we naturally lower our key, as those, to whom we speak,
come nearer. When, therefore, we have no idea of being
heard at a distance, the voice will not be so apt to rise into a
higher key, when we wish to be forcible; and, consequently,
exerting as much force as we are able, in a small room, and to
people near us, will tend to swell and strengthen the voice,
in the middle tone.-.Rhetorical Grammar, p. 245.
LOW  TONES OF VOICE,
May be acquired and strengthened, by practice on such pieces
as naturally require a pitch a little below the natural or conversational tone; such, for example, as contain the expression
of hatred, scorn, or reproach, as well as those of a very grave
and solemn character.  When the student can pronounce
such pieces with ease and force, let him practice them on a
little lower note, and so on, until the voice has been sufficiently cultivated in that direction.
EXAMPLES.
1.        O, proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fears:
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said
Led you to Duncan. Oh, these pains and starts
(Impostors to true fear) would well become
A woman's story, at a winter's fire,
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
You look but on a stool.
2.   Thou slave! thou wretch'! thou coward!
Thou little valiant, great in villainy!
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou fortune's champion, thou dost never fight
But when her humoius ladyship is by,
To teach thee safety! Thou art perjured too,
And sooth'stu X greatness. What a fool art thou,
A rampinIol.; to'brag, and stamp, and sweat,
Upon my    i! thou cold-blooded slave.
3.      1P'ioi&amp;be their drink,
Gall, wor-se than gall, the daintiest meat they taste;53
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
Their sweetest prospects, murdering basilisks!
Their softest touch as smart as lizard's stings I
Their music, frightful as the serpent's hiss;
And boding screech-owls make the concert full.
4. God! thou art mighty! At thy footstool bound,
Lie, gazing to thee, Chance, and Life, and Death;
Nor in the angel-circle flaming round,
Nor in the million worlds that blaze beneath,
Is one that can withstand thy wrath's hot breath.
Woe, in thy frown: in thy smile, victory:
Hear my last prayer! I ask no mortal wreath;
Let but these eyes my rescued country see,
Then take my spirit, all omnipotent, to thee.
5.         What eye
Has not been dazzled by thy majesty?
Where is the ear that has not heard thee speak?
Thou breathest! forest-oaks of centuries
Turn their uprooted trunks toward the skies!
Thou thunderest! adamantine mountains break,
Tremble, and totter, and apart are riven!
Thou lightenest! and the rocks inflame; thy power
Of fire, to their metallic bosom driven,
Melts and devours them; lo! they are no more;
They pass away like wax in the fierce flame,
Or the thick mists that frown upon the sun,
Which he but glances at, and they are gone.
HIGH TONES OF VOICE,
May be acquired by a process similar to that just described.
Select such passages as require a high key, and read them
with the utmost possible force. Then pitch the voice a little
higher, at each successive reading, and so on until the end is
accomplished. Speaking in the open air, at the very top of
the voice, is an exercise admirably adapted to strengthen the
voice and give it compass, and should be frequently practiced.

purpose? while with equal zeal he labored to gain others to our
interest?  Was he not to cut off the best and most important
resources of our enemies, and to supply those in which our country

and groves of Alba! you, the demolished Alban altars i ever accounted holy by the Romans, and coeval with our religion, but
whichl Clodius, in his mad fury, having first cut down and leveled
the most sacred groves, had sunk under heaps of common buildings; I appeal to you; I call you to witness, whether yotur altars,
your divinities, your powers, which he had polluted with all kinds
of wickedness, did not avenge themselves when this wretch was
extirpated.  And thou, oh holy Jupiter! from the hight of thy
sacred mount, whose lakes, groves, and boundaries, he had so often
contaminated with his detestable impurities; and you, the other
deities, whom he had insulted, at length opened your eyes, to
punish this enormous offender. By you, by you, and in your sight,
was the slow, but the righteous and merited vengeance executed
upon him.
FULLNESS AND ROTUNDITY OF VOICE.
By this term is meant that quality of voice, to which the
Romans gave the name of " ore rotundo," because the sounds
are formed with a "round, open mouth."  It is exemplified
in the hailing of a ship, " ship aho----y;" in the reply of55
the sailor, when, in the roar of the storm, he answers his
captain, " ay    e, ay    e; and in the command of the
officer to his troops, when, amid the thunder of artillery, he
gives the order, "ma    rch," or "ha     lt."
This fullness or roundness of tone is secured, by dwelling
on the vowel sound, and indefinitely protracting it.  The
mouth should be opened wide, the tongue kept down, and the
aperture left as round, and as free for the voice as possible.
It is this artificial rotundity, which, in connection with a
distinct articulation, enables the field orator, or one who
speaks in a very large apartment, to send his voice to the most
distant point.  It is a certain degree of this quality, which
distinguishes declamatory, or public speaking or reading, from
private conversation, and no one can accomplish much, as a
public speaker, without cultivating it. It must be carefully
distinguished from the " high tone,' which is an elevation of
pitch, and from  " loudness," or " strength" of voice, both
which qualities have been treated of, in the preceding article.
EXAMPLES.
[Let the pupil practice upon examples like the following, dwelling
upon the sounds of the italicized vowels.]

MANAGEMENT OF THE VOICE.
ON this subject we can do nothing better than lay before
the student an extract from Mr. Walker's excellent "' Rhetorical Grammar."
"As the voice naturally slides into a higher tone, when we
want to speak louder, but not so easi:ly into a lower tone, when
we want to speak more softly, the first care of every reader
and speaker ought to be, to acquire the power of lowering the
voice when it is too high.  Experience shows us that we
can raise our voice at pleasure, to any pitch it is capable of;
but the same experience tells us, that it requires infinite art
and practice to bring the voice to a lower key, when it is once
raised too high.  It ought, therefore, to be a first principle
with all public readers and speakers, rather to begin under the
common level of the voice, than above it.
"Every one, therefore, who would acquire a variety of tone,
in public reading or speaking, must avoid, as the greatest evil,
a loud and vociferous beginning; and, for this purpose, it
would be prudent in a reader or speaker, to adapt his voice
as if only to be heard by the person nearest to him.  If his
voice has natural strength, and the subject any thing impassioned in it, a higher and louder tone will insensibly steal on
him, and his greatest address must be directed to keep it within bounds.  For this purpose, it will be frequently necessary
for him to recall his voice, as it were, from the extremities of
his auditory, and direct it to those who are nearest to him.
" If, in the course of reading, the voice should slide into
a higher tone, and this tone too often recur, care must be
taken to throw in a variety, by beginning subsequent sentences
in a lower tone, and (if the subject will admit of it) in a
monotone; for the monotone is the most efficacious means of
bringing the voice from  high to low, and of altering it when
it has been too long in the same key."
With regard to those changes of tone which are required bythe character of the sentiment uttered, such as a sudden transition from high to low, or the contrary, plaintiveness or expressiveness of voice, a slow or quick delivery, and other
things of a like nature, rules seem to be unnecessary, and even
to impede improvement.
QUESTIONS.-What, with regard to the voice, is an important object
of every speaker's attention? What key ought he most diligently to
improve? What is meant by the natural pitch? How may this be
cultivated? What difficulty is there in doing this? What is the best
method of obviating this difficulty? How may the lower tones of the
voice be strengthened?  How may high tones of voice be acquired?
Is it easier to raise the voice, or to lower it? In what tone ought a
speaker to commence? What is especially to be avoided in the beginning?  In what way may the voice, if too high, be brought down?
VI. GESTURE.
IT is not designed, in this book, to give a minute system of
rules and instructions on the subject of Gesture. That would
be a difficult task without the assistance of plates; and even
with their aid, any directions must be very imperfect, without
the example and illustrations of the living teacher, as the
speaking model.  It will be sufficient to give some general
hints by means of which the student may form rules, or pursue a discipline for himself.
Gesture is that part of the speaker's manner, which pertains
to his attitude, to the use and carriage of his person, and the
movement of his limbs in delivery.
Every person, in beginning to speak, feels the natural embarrassment resulting from his new position. The novelty of
the situation destroys his self-possession, and, with the loss of
that, he becomes awkward, his arms and hands hang clumsily,
and now, for the first time, seem to him  worse than superfluous members. This embarrassment will be overcome gradually, as the speaker becomes familiar with his position; and it
is sometimes overcome at once, by a powerful exercise of the
attention npon the matter of the speech.  When that fills and
possesses the mind, the orator insensibly takes the attitude
which is becoming, and, at least, easy and natural, if not
graceful.GESTURE.
1st. The first general direction that should be given to the
speaker is, that he should stand erect and firm, and in that
posture that gives an expanded chest and full play to the
organs of respiration and utterance.
2d. Let the attitude be such that it can be shifted with ease,
and without shuffling and hitching the limbs. The student
will find, by trial, that no attitude is so favorable to this end,
as that in which the weight of the body is thrown upon one
leg, leaving the other free to be advanced or thrown back, as
fatigue or the proper action of delivery may require.
The student, who has any regard to grace or elegance, will
of course avoid all the gross faults which are so common
among public speakers, such as resting one foot upon stools
and benches, or throwing the body lazily forward upon the
support of the rostrum.
3d. Next to attitude, come the movements of the person
and limbs. In these, two objects are to be observed, and, if
possible, combined, viz., propriety and grace.  There is expression in the extended arm, the clinched hand, the open
palm, and the smiting of the breast. But let no gesture be
made that is not in harmony with the thought or sentiment
that is uttered; for it is this harmony which constitutes propriety. As far as possible, let there be a correspondence between the style of action and the strain of thought. Where
the thought flows on calmly and sweetly, let there be the same
graceful and easy flow of gesture and action. Where the style
is sharp and abrupt, there is propriety in the quick, short, and
abrupt gesticulation. Especially avoid that ungraceful sawing
of the air with the arms, into which an ill-regulated fervor betrays many young speakers.
What is called a graceful manner, can only be obtained by
those who have some natural advantages of person.'So far
as it is in the reach of study or practice, it seems to depend
chiefly upon the general cultivation of manners, implying
freedom from all embarrassments, and entire self-possession.
The whole secret of acquiring a graceful style of gesture,
we apprehend, lies in the habitual practice, not only when
speaking, but at all times, of free and graceful movements
of the limbs.59
There is no limb nor feature, which the accomplished
speaker will not employ with effect, in the course of a various and animated delivery. But the arms are the chief re-,
liance of the orator in gesture; and it will not be amiss to
give a hint or two, in reference to their proper use.
And first;-It is not an uncommon fault to use ope arm
exclusively, and to give that a uniform  movement.  Such
movement may, sometimes, have grown habitual from one's
profession or employment. But in learners, also, there is
often a predisposition to this fault.
Secondly;-It is not unusual to see a speaker use only
the lower half of his arm.  This always gives a stiff and
constrained manner to delivery. Let the whole arm move,
and let the movement be free and flowing.
Thirdly;--As a general rule, let the hand be open, with the
fingers slightly curved.  It then seems liberal, communicative,
and candid; and, in some degree, gives that expression to the
style of delivery. Of course, there are passages which require
the clinched hand, the pointed finger, &amp;c.; but these are used
to give a particular expression.
Fourthly;-In the movements of the arm, study variety and
the grace of curved lines.
When a gesture is made with one arm only, the eye should
be cast in the direction of that arm; not at it, but over it.
All speakers employ, more or less, the motions of the head.
In reference to that member, we make but one observation.
Avoid the continuous bobbing and shaking of the head, which
is so conspicuous in the action of many ambitious public
speakers.
The beauty and force of all gesture consist in its timely,
judicious, and natural employment, when it can serve to
illustrate the meaning, or give emphasis to the force of an important passage. The usual fault of young speakers is too
much action. To emphasize all parts alike, is equivalent to no
emphasis; and by employing forcible gestures on unimportant
passages, we diminish our power to render other parts impressive.DIRECTION'S.
TO TEACHERS.
In ARTICULATION, as the exercises are already extensive, a few lessons only are added, especially adapted to
the purpose of practice.
The INFLECTIONS marked are in accordance with the best
authorities, both American and English, among whom may be
mentioned SHERIDAN KNOWLES as a leading and standard
author on this subject.  At the same time, it must be remembered, that, in many cases, inflections depend upon the degree
of emphasis, and, on this point, opinions and tastes may vary
in different individuals, and sometimes in the same individual
at different times. It is also to be noticed, that the rising inflection is often used in a slight degree without being discerned.except by an acute and educated ear; pupils learn to distinguish it with great difficulty, and teachers frequently do not
perceive it, unless under emphasis.
In EMPHASIS and POETPRY, the lessons for practice include
all the previous notation.
With regard to the lessons on AIODULATION, a single remark
seems necessary. The tone and manner in which emotion is
expressed, are instinctive. A proper expression can be given,
only by imbibing the spirit of the subject. In the notation,
high and low tones are specifically indicated. Loudness is
sufficiently denoted in most cases, by emphasis.
The following characters are used in the following places.

"~~~~~~~UEXERCISES IN ARTICULATION.
THE five following Exercises are intended especially for practice
in Articulation, and are commended to the Teacher's attention.
EXERCISE I. -THE GROTTO OF ANTIPAROS.
FROM GOLDS-M[ITH.
OLIVER GOLDSMITH was born in Ireland, in 1731. After Dis graduation at the Dublin University, he went to London, to seek support
by his pen; and during the greater part of hiS life, worked as a mere
compiler for the booksellers.  His poems of "The Traveler," and
"The Deserted Village," established his fame. He died in 1774.
1. Archipelago; (pro. Ark-e-pel/-a-go), a narrow sea bordering on
Greece, and containing many small islands.
2. Levantine; the eastern part of the Mediterranean sea is called
the Levant, and a Levantine mariner is a seaman of that region.
1. OF all the subterraneous caverns now known. the
grotto of Antiparos is the most remarkable, as well for its
extent as for the beauty of its sparry incrustations.  This
celebrated cavern was first explored by one Magni, an Italian
traveler, about one hundred years ago, at Antiparos, an inconsiderable island of the Archipelago.
2. "Having been informed," says he, "by the natives of
Paros, that, in the little island of Antiparos, which lies about
two miles from the'former, a gigantic statue was to be seen at
the mouth of a cavern in that place, it was resolved that we
(the French consul and himself) should pay it a visit.
3. "In pursuance of this rcsolution, after we had landed
on the island, and walked about four miles through the midst
of beautiful plains, and sloping woodlands, we at length came
to a little hill, on the side of which yawned a most horrid
cavern, which, by its gloom, at first struck us with terror, and
almost repressed curiosity.  Recovering the first surprise,
61NEW SIXTH READER.
however, we entered boldly, and had not proceeded abovetwenty paces, when the supposed statue of the giant presented
itself to view.
4. " We quickly perceived that what the ignorant natives
had been terrified at as a giant, was nothing more than a
sparry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the
roof of the cave, and by degrees hardening into a figure,
which their fears had formed into a monster. Incited by this
extraordinary appearance, we were induced to proceed still
further, in quest of new adventures, in this subterranean
abode.
5. "As we proceeded, new wonders offered themselves;
the spars formed into trees and shrubs, presented a kind of
petrified grove; some white, some green; and all receding in
due perspective. They struck us with the more amazement,
as we knew them to be mere productions of nature, who,
hitherto in solitude, had, in her playful moments, dressed tho
scene as if for her own amusement.
6. "We had as yet seen but a few of the wonders of the
place; and we were introduced only into the portico of this
amazing  temple.  In one corner of this half-illuminated
recess, there appeared an opening of about three feet wide,
which seemed to lead to a place totally dark, and which one
of the natives assured us contained nothing more than a reservoir of water.
7. "Upon this information, we made an experiment, by
throwing down some stones, which rumbling along the sides
of the descent for some time, the sound seemed at last
quashed in a bed of water. In order, however, to be more
certain, we sent in a Levantine mariner, who, by the promise of
a good reward, ventured, with a flambeau in his hand, into this
narrow aperture.
8. "After continuing within it for about a quarter of an
hour, he returned,'bearing in his hand some beautiful pieces
of white spar, which art could neither equal nor imitate.
Upon being informed by him that the place was full of these
beautiful incrustations, I ventured in with him, about fifty
paces, anxiously and cautiously descending, by a steep and
dangerous way.
9. "Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which;63
ECLECTIC SERIES.
led into a spacious amphitheater, (if I may so call it,) still
deeper than any other part, we returned, and being provided
with a ladder, flambeau, and other things to expedite our
descent, our whole company, man by man, ventured into the
same opening; and, descending one after another, we at last
saw ourselves all together in the most magnificent part of
the cavern.
10. "Our candles being now all lighted up, and the whole
place completely illuminated, never could the eye be presented
with a more glittering or a more magnificent scene; the
whole roof hung with solid icicles, transparent as glass, yet
solid as marble.
11. "The eye could scarcely reach the lofty and noble
ceiling; the sides were regularly formed with spars; and the
whole presented the idea of a magnificent theater, illuminated
with an immense prolf~sion of lights.  The floor consisted of
solid marble; and, in several places, magnificent columns,
thrones, altars, and other objects, appeared, as if nature had
designed to mock the curiosities of art.
12. "Our voices, upon speaking or singing, were redoubled,
to an astonishing loudness; and upon the firing of a-gun, the
noise and reverberations were almost deafening.  In the
midst of this grand amphitheater rose a concretion of about
fifteen feet high, that, in some measure, resembled an altar;
from which, taking the hint, we caused mass to be celebrated
there. The beautiful columns that shot up around the altar
appeared like candlesticks; and many other natural objects
represented the customary ornaments of this rite.
13. "Below even this spacious grotto, there seeme(d another
cavern; down which I ventured with my former mariner, and
descended about fifty paces, by means of a rope. I at last
arrived at a small spot of level ground, where the bottom
appeared different from that of the amphitheater, being composed of soft clay, yielding to the pressure, and in which I
thrust a stick to the depth of six feet.
14. "In this, however, as above, numbers of the most
beautiful crystals were formed; one of which, particularly,
resembled a table. Upon our egress from this amazing cavern,
we perceived a Greek inscription upon a rock at the mouth,
but so obliterated by time that we could not read it distinctly.It seems to import that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come hither; but whether he penetrated into the
depths of the cavern, he does not see fit to inform us."  This
account of so beautiful and striking a scene may serve to give
us some idea of the subterraneous wonders of nature.
EXERCISE II. - THE THUNDER STORI.
}FROM THOMSON.
JAMEs THOMSON was born in Scotland, in 1700. His fame rests chiefly on
the poem of "The Seasons," which will ever be popular through its vivid
descriptions of natural scenery. He died at Kew, in 1748.
1. As from the face of heaven the shatter'd* clouds
Tumultuous rove, the interminable sky
Sublimer swells, and o'er the world expands
A purer azure.
2. Through the lighten'd* air
A higher luster and a clearer calm,
Diffusive, tremble; while, as if in sign
Of danger past, a glittering robe of joy,
Set off abundant by the yellow ray,
Invests the fields; and nature smiles revived.
3.'T is beauty all, and grateful song around,
Join'd to the low of kine, and numerous bleat
Of flocks thick-nibbling through the clover'd vale;
And shall the hymn be marr'd by thankless Man,
Most favor'd! who with voice articulate
Should lead the chorus of this lower world?
4.  Shall man, so soon forgetful of the Hand
That hush'd the thunder, and serenes the sky,
Extinguish'd feel that spark the tempest waked,
That sense of power, exceeding far his own,
Ere yet his feeble heart has lost its fears?
*To TEACHERS.-AAS the final letters-ED-are rarely pronounced
as a distinct syllable, and since the learner has become perfectly
familiar with the orthographical form of words in the first five books
of this series, it has been thought best, in THIS and the High School
Reader, to introduce the apostrophe in place of E, in the lessons in
verse, when, by so doing, the word will admit of no mispronunciation;
thus familiarizing the pupil with the application of the apostrophe,
so extensively used by the best writers of poetry.EXERCISE III. - DESCRIPTION OF A. STORM.'FROM D'ISRAELI.
D'IsRAELI is an English writer, who first distinguished himself
as an author, but has, for several years, devoted himself to politics.
He has been a member of the English ministry and of Parliament.
1. * * * THEY looked round on every side, and hope
gave way before the scene of desolation. Immense branches
were shivered from the largest trees; small ones were entirely
stripped of their leaves; the long grass was bowed to the
earth; the waters were whirled in eddies out of the little
rivulets; birds, leaving their nests to seek shelter in the
crevices of the rocks, unable to stem the driving air, flapped
their wings and fell upon the earth; the frightened animals
of the plain, almost stffocated by the impetuosity of the
wind, sought safety, and found destruction; some of the
largest trees were torn up by the roots; the sluices of the
nountains were filled, and innumerable torrents rushed down
the before empty gullies.   The  heavens now  open, and
the lightning and thunder contend with the horrors of the
wind.
2. In a moment, all was again hushed. Dead silence succeeded the bellow of the thunder, the roar of the wind, the
rush of the waters, the moaning of the beasts, the screaming
of the birds!  Nothing was heard save the plash of the
agitated lake, as it beat up against the black rocks which girt
it in.
3. Again, greater darkness enveloped the trembling earth.
Anon, the heavens were rent with lightning, which nothing
could have quenched but the descending deluge.  Cataracts
poured down from the lowering firmanent. For an instant,
the horses dashed madly forward; beast and rider blinded-and
stifled by the gushing rain, and gasping for breath. Shelter
was nowhere. The quivering beasts reared, and snorted, and
sank upon their knees, dismounting their riders.
4. He had scarcely spoken, when there burst forth a terrific
noise, they knew not what; a rush, they could not understand;
a vibration which shook them on their horses. Every terror
sank before the roar of the cataract.  It seemed that the

IV. - HYMN TO THE NIGHT-WIND.
1. UNBRIDLED SPIRIT, throned upon the lap
Of ebon Midnight, whither dost thou stray?
Whence didst thou come, and where is thy abode?
From slumber I awaken at the sound
Of thy most melancholy voice; siublime,
Thou ridest on the rolling clouds, which take
The form of sphinx, or hippogriff, or car,
Like those of Roman conquerors of yore,
In Nemean pastimes used, by fiery steeds
Drawn headlong on; or choosest, all unseen,
To ride-the vault, and drive the murky storms
Before thee, or bow down, with giant wing,
The wondering forests as thou sweepest by!
2. Daughter of Darkness! when remote the noise
Of tumult, and of discord, and mankind;
When but the watch-dog's voice is heard, or wolves
That bay the silent night, or from the tower,
Ruin'd and rent, the note of boding owl,
Or lapwing's shrill and solitary cry;
When sleep weighs down the eyelids of the world,
And life is as it were not; down the sky
Forth from thy cave, wide-roaming, thou dost come
To hold nocturnal orgies.
3.         Behold!
Stemming with eager prow the Atlantic tide,
Holds on the intrepid mariner; abroad
The wings of night brood shadowy; heave the waves
Around him, mutinous, their curling heads,
Portentous of a storm; all hands are plied,
A zealous task, and sounds the busy deck
With notes of preparation; many an -eye
Is upward cast toward the clouded heaven;67
And many a thought, with troubled tenderness,
Dwells on the calm tranquillity of home;
And many a heart its supplicating prayer
Breathes forth; meanwhile, the boldest sailor's cheek
Blanches; stout courage fails; young childhood's shriek,
Awfully piercing, bursts; and woman's fears
Are speechless.
4.         With a low, insidious.moan,
Rush past the gales that harbinger thy way,
And hail thy advent; gloom the murky clouds
Darker around; and heave the maddening waves,
Iligher their-crested summits. With a glare
Unvailing but the clouds and foaming sea,
Flashes the lightning; then, with doubling peal
Reverberating to the gates of heaven,
Rolls the deep thunder, with tremendous crash,
Sublime as if the firmament were rent
Amid the severing clouds that pour their storms,
Commingling sea and sky.
5.        Disturb'd, arise
The monsters of: the deep, and wheel around
Their mountainous bulk unwieldy, while aloft,
Pois'd on the feathery summit of the wave,
Hangs the frail bark, its howlings of despair,
Lost on the mocking storm. Then frantic, thou
Dost rise, tremendous Power, thy wings unfurl'd;
Unfurl'd, but not to succor nor to save:
Then is thine hour of triumph; with a yell
Thou rushest on; and with a maniac tone
Sing'st in the rifted shroud; the straining mast
Yields, and the cordage cracks.
6.        Thou churn'st the deep
To madness, tearing up the yellow sands
From their profound recesses, and dost strew
The clouds around thee, and within thy hand
Tak'st up the billowy tide, and dashest down
The vessel to destruction!--She is not!
But when the morning lifts her dewy eye,
And to a quiet calm, the elements,
Subsiding from their fury, have dispers'd,
There art thou, like a satiate conqueror,
Recumbent on the murmuring deep, thy smiles
All unrepentant of the savage wreck.NEW  SIXTH  READER.
V.-  THE CATARACT OF LODORE.
FROM SOUTHEY.
ROBERT SOUTHEY, a distinguished English poet, was born in Bristol, in
1774. He wrote upon a great variety of subjects, and was, in 1813, appointed Poet Laureate, a post which he retained till his decease, in March,
1843.
[This lesson is inserted on account of its very peculiar adaptation for
practice on the difficult sound ijlg.]
How does the water
Come down at Lodore?
From its sources which well
In the tarn on the fell;
From its fountains
In the mountains,
Its rills and its gills;
Through moss and through brake,
It runs and it creeps,
For awhile, till it sleeps
In its own little lake.
And thence at departing
Awakening and starting,
It runs through the reeds,
And away it proceeds,
Through meadow and glade
In sun and in shade,
And through the wood-shelter,
Among crags in its flurry,
Helter-skelter,
Hurry-skurry.
Here it comes sparkling,
And there it lies darkling:
Now smoking and frothing
Its tumult and wrath in,
Till, in this rapid race,
On which it is bent,
It reaches the place
Of its steep descent.
The cataract strong
Then plunges along,
Striking and raging,As if a war waging
Its caverns and rocks among;
Rising and leaping,
Sinking and creeping,
Swelling and sweeping,
Showering and springing,
Flying and flinging,
Writhing and ringing,
Eddying and whisking,
Spouting and frisking,
Turning and twisting,
Around and around
With endless rebound:
Smiting and fighting,
A sight to delight in,
Confounding, astounding,
Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound:
Collecting, projecting,
Receding and speeding,
And shocking and rocking,
And darting and parting,
And threading and spreading,
And whizzing and hissing,
And dripping and skipping,
And hitting and splitting,
And shining and twining,
And rattling and battling,
And shaking and quaking,
And pouring and roaring,
And waving and raving,
And tossing and crossing,
And guggling and struggling,
And heaving and cleaving,
And moaning and groaning,
And glittering and frittering,
And gathering and feathering;
And whitening and brightening,
And quivering and shivering,
And hurrying and skurrying,
And thundering and floundering;
Dividing and gliding and sliding,
And falling and brawling and sprawling,
69NEW SIXTH READER.
And driving and riving and striving,
And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling:
And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping,
And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing;
And so never ending, but always descending,
Sounds and motions forever and ever are blending,
All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar:
And this way, the water comes down at Lodore.
ON INFLECTION.
The following exercises to the 62 are, nlost of them, marked with
the appropriate inflections, beginning with a few of the more simple
principles, and gradually adding others.
VI. - INDUSTRY NECESSARY FOR THE ORATOR.
FRoM&amp; H. WARE, JR.
1. THE history of the world is full of testimony to prove
how much depends upon industry"; not an eminent author
has lived but is an example' of it. Yet, in contradiction to
all this', the almost universal feeling appears to be, that industry can effect nothing&gt;, that eminence is the result of
accident', and that every one must be -content to remain just
what he may happen to be". Thus multitudes', who come
forward as teachers and guides, suffer themselves to be satisfied
with the most indifferent attainments, and a miserable mediocrity', without so much as inquiring how they might rise
higher, much less-making any attempt" to rise.
2. For any other art they would serve an apprenticeship,
and would be ashamed to practice it in public', before they
have learned' it. If any one would sing', he attends a
master, and is drilled in the very elementary principles'; and,
only after the most laborious process, dares to exercise his
voice in public'. This he does"', though he has scarce any
thing to learn but the mechanical execution of what lies, in
sensible forms, before his eye'. But the extempore speaker',
who is to invent as well as to utter, to carry on an operation
of the mind as well as to produce sound", enters upon71
the work without preparatory discipline, and then wonders
that he fails'.
3. If he were learning to play on the flute for public exhibition, what hours and days would he spend in giving facility
to his fingers, and attaining the power of the sweetest and most
impressive execution'. If he were devoting himself to the
organ', what months and years would he labor, that he might
know its compass, and be master of its keys', and be able to
draw out, at will, all its various combinations of harmonious
sounds', and its full richness and delicacy of expression'.
And yet, he will fancy, that the grandest, the most various,
the most expressive of all instruments', which the infinite
Creator has fashioned by the union of an intellectual soul with
the powers of speech', may be played upon without study or
practice'. He comes to it a mere uninstructed tyro"', and
thinks to manage all its stops', and to command the whole
compass of its varied and comprehensive power'. He finds
himself a bungler in the attempt, is mortified at his failure',
and settles in his mind forever, that the attempt is vain'.
4. Success in every art, whatever may be the natural talent,
is -always the reward of industry and pains'. But the instances are many, of men of the finest natural genius, whose
beginning has promised much, but who have degenerated
wretchedly as they advanced, because they trusted to their
gifts', and made no effort to improve'. That there have
never been other men of equal endowments with Cicero and
Demosthenes', none would venture to suppose'. If those
great men had been content, like others, to continue as they
began, and had never made their persevering efforts of improvement', their countries would have been little benefited
by their genius, and the world would never have known their
fame'. They would have been lost in the undistinguished
crowd that sank to oblivion around' them.
5. Of how many more will the same remark prove true'!
What encouragement is thus given to the industrious'! With
such encouragement, how inexcusable is the negligence which
suffers the most interesting and important truths to seem
heavy and dull, and fall ineffectual to the ground', through
mere sluggishness in the delivery'!  How unworthy of one
who performs the high function of a religious instructor, uponNEW  SIXTH READER.
whom  depend, in a great measure, the religious knowledge'&gt;
and devotional sentiment&gt;, and final character' of many fellow
beings, to imagine that he can worthily discharge this great
concern by occasionally talking for an hour, he knows not
how', and in a manner he has taken no pains to render correct', or attractive'; and which, simply through that want of
command over himself, which study would give, is immethodical', verbose', inaccurate', feeble', trifling'!  It has been
said of a great preacher,
That truths divine come mended fro:m his tongue".
Alas! they come ruined and worthless from such a man as
this'. They lose that holy energy, by which they are to convert the soul, and purify man for heaven', and sink, in interest
and efficacy, below the level of those principles', which govern
the ordinary affairs of this lower world'.
REMARK.-In the last paragraph, the words "knowledge," "sentiment," "character," and "immethodical," "verbose," "feeble;" &amp;c.,
are embraced under the rule for series. See Rules X and XI.
VII. - THE OLD HOUSE CLOCK.
1. OH! the old, old clock of the household stock',
Was the brightest thing, and neatest';
Its hands, though old, had a touch of gold',
And its chimes rang still the sweetest';'Twas a monitor, too, though its words were few-',
Yet they liv'd, though nations alter'd';
And its voice, still strong, warn'd old and young,
When the voice of friendship falter'd';
"Tick! tick!" it said, "quick, quick to bed':
For ten I've given warning';
Up! up! and go, or else you know',
You'll never rise soon in the morning'!"
2. A friendly voice was that old, old clock',
As it stood in the corner smiling,
And bless'd the time with a merry chime,
The wintry hours beguiling';
But a cross old voice was that tiresome clock-',
As it call'd at daybreak boldly';
When the dawn look'd gray o'er the misty way,73
And the early air look'd coldly':
"Tick! tick!" it said, "quick out of bed;
For five I'ye given warning';
You'll never have health, you'11 never have wealth',
Unless you're up soon in the morning'!"
3. Still hourly the sound goes round and round',
With a tone that ceases never';
While tears are shed for bright days fled',
And the old friends lost forever!
Its heart beats on, though hearts are gone,
That beat like ours, though stronger';
Its hands still move, though hands we love
Are clasp'd on earth no longer'-!
"Tick! tick!" it said, "to the churchyard bed',
The grave hath given warning':
Up! up! and rise', and look at the skies,
And prepare for a heavenly morning'!"
VIII.- SCHEMES OF LIFE OFTEN ILLUSORY.
FROM DR.' JOHNSON.DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON was born in Litchfield, England, in 1709. He
came to London, determined to devote himself to literature, and he
principally maintained himself by writing for the magazines and
other periodicals.  After the publication of the Rambler and the
English Dictionary, he found himself indisputably at the head of his
literary contemporaries. He died in 1784.
1. OMAR, the son of Hassan', had passed seventy-five
years in honor and prosperity'.  The favor of three successive
califs had filled his house with gold and silver; and when
ever he appeared', the benedictions of the people proclaimed
his passage'.
2. Terrestrial happiness is of short continuance'.  The
brightness of the flame is wasting its fuel'; the fragrant flower
is passing away in its own odors-.  The vigor of Omar began
to fail'; the curls of beauty fell from  his head"; strength
departed from his hands, and agility from his feet'.  He gave
back to the calif the keys of trust, and the seals of secrecy;
and sought no other pleasure for the remainder of life than the
converse of the wise and the gratitude of the good'.NEW SIXTH READER.
3. The powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His
chamber was filled by visitants, eager to catch the dictates of
experience, and officious to pay the tribute of admiration.
Caleb, the son of the-viceroy of Egypt', entered every day
early, and retired late'.  He was beautiful and eloquent':
Omar-admired his wit, and loved his docility.
4. "Tell me," said Caleb, "thou to whose voice nations
have listened, and whose wisdom is known to the extremities
of Asia-, tell me, how I may resemble Omar the prudent'.
The arts by which thou hast gained power and preserved it,
are to thee no longer necessary or useful; impart to me' the
secret of thy conduct, and teach me the plan upon which thy
wisdom has built thy fortune'."
5.' Young man-," said Omar; "it is of little use to form
plans of life'. When I took my first survey of the world, in
my twentieth year', having considered the various conditions
of mankind, in the hour of solitude, I said thus to myself,
leaning against a cedar, which spread its branches over my
head:'Seventy years are allowed to man'; I have yet fifty
remaining.
6. "'Ten years I will allot to the attainment of knowledge', and ten I will pass in foreign countries'; I shall be
learned and therefore shall be honored'; every city will
shout at my arrival, and every student will solicit my friendship'.  Twenty years thus passed, will store my mind with
images, which I stall be busy, through the rest of my life,
in combiDing and comparing.  I shall revel in inexhaustible
accumulations of intellectual riches; I shall find new pleasures for every moment, and shall never more be weary of
myself.
7. "'I will not, however, deviate too far from the beaten
track of life'; but will try what can be found in female delicacy'.  I will marry a wife as beautiful as the Houries",
and wise as Zobeide'; and with her I will live twenty years
within the suburbs of Bagdat, in every pleasure that wealth
can purchase, and fancy can invent.
8. "'I will then retire to a rural dwelling, pass my days
in obscurity and contemplation; and lie silently down on the
bed of death. Through my life it shall be my settled resolution, that I will never depend on the smile of princes; that I75
will never stand exposed to the artifices of courts; I will
never pant for public honors, nor disturb my quiet with the
affairs of state.' Such was my scheme of life, which I
impressed indelibly upon my memory.
9. " The first part of my ensuing time was to.be spent in
search of knowledge', and I know not how I was diverted
from my design". I had no visible impediments without', nor
any ungovernable passions within". I regarded knowledge as
the highest honor, and the most engaging pleasure'; yet day
stole upon day, and month glided after month, till I found
that seven years of the first ten had vanished", and left
nothing behind' them.
10. "I now postponed my purpose of traveling; for why
should I go abroad', while so much remained to be learned at
home'?  I immured myself for four years, and studied the
laws of the empire.  The fame of my skill reached the
judges: I was found able to speak upon doubtful questions,
and I was commanded to stand at the footstool of the calif.
I was heard with attention; I was consulted with confidence,
and the love of praise fastened on my heart.
11. "I still wished to see distant countries; listened with
rapture to the relations of travelers, and resolved some time
to ask my dismission, that I might feast my soul with
novelty'; but my presence was always necessary, and the
stream  of business hurried me along.  Sometimes, I was
afraid lest I should be charged with ingratitude; but I still
proposed to travel, and therefore would not confine myself
by marriage.
12. "In my fiftieth year', I began to suspect that the time
of my traveling was past; and thought it best to lay hold on
the felicity yet in my power, and indulge myself in domestic"
pleasures. But, at fifty, no man easily finds a woman beautiful as the Houries, and wise as Zobeide.  I inquired and
rejected, consulted and deliberated, till the sixty-second year.
made me ashamed of wishing to marry. I had now nothing
left but retirement'; and for retirement I never found a time",
till disease forced me from public employment'.
13. "Such was my scheme', and such has been its consequence'. With an insatiable thirst for knowledge', I trifled
away the years of improvement'; with a'restless desire ofPreferred by the best Teachers.

This is owing to their rare and unquestioned merit, as numerous
testimonials from leading educators show.
They are commended as "works of the highest merit,-clear,

system of teaching the principles of the English language."
their philosophical plan and simplicity of arrangement, the
progressive character of the lessons, the abundance, variety

IX.-THE NEEDLE.
1. THE gay belles of fashion may boast of excelling
In waltz or cotillon, at whist or quadrille;
And seek admiration by vauntingly telling
Of drawing, and painting, and musical skill:
But give me the fair one, in country or city',
Whose home and its duties are dear to her heart,
Who cheerfully warbles some rustical ditty",
While plying the needle with exquisite art:
The bright little needle", the swift-flying needle',
The needle directed by beauty and art.
2. If Love have a potent, a magical token',
A talisman, ever resistless and true',
A charm that is never evaded or broken',
A witchery certain the heart to subdue",'T is this', and his armory never has furnish'd
So keen and unerring, or polish'd a dart;
Let beauty direct it, so polish'd and burnish'd",
And O! it s certain of touching the heart':
The bright little needle", the swift-flying needles,
The needle directed by beauty and art'.
3. Be wise, then, ye maidens", nor seek admiration",
By dressing for conquest, and flirting with all';
You never, whate'er be your fortune or station',
Appear half so lovely at rout or at ball',
As gayly convened at the work-cover'd table,
Each cheerfully active playing her part',
Beguiling the task with a song or a fable',
And plying the needle with exquisite art:
The bright little ne'edle, the swift-flying needle,
The needle directed by beauty and art.X.- DEATH OF LITTLE NELL.
FROM DICKENS.
CHARLES DICKENS of England, is one of the most popular writers
of the day, and is admired as a graphic delineator of human character.  He has published numerous interesting works, and is, at
present, conductor of the periodical " Household Words."
1. SHE was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm', so free
from trace of pain', so fair to looks upon.  She seemed a
creature fresh from the hand of God, and waiting for the
breath of life'; not one who had lived', and suffered death'.
Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries
and green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to
favor. "When I die', put near me something that has loved
the light, and had the sky above it always'."  Those were
her words.
2. She was dead. Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was
dead'. Her little bird, a poor slight thing the pressure of a
finger would have crushed, was stirring nimbly in its cage',
and the strong heart of its child-mistress was mute and
motionless forever'! Where were the traces of her early
cares, her sufferings, and fatigues'?  All gone'. Sorrow was
dead, indeed, in her; but peace and perfect happiness were
born, imaged, in her tranquil beauty and profound repose.
3. And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this
change.  Yes'! the old fireside had smiled upon that same
sweet face'; it had passed, like a dream', throuigh the haunts
of misery and care'; at the door of the poor sclaoolmaster on
the summer evening', before the furnace-fire upon the cold
wet night' at the still bedside of the dying boy', there had
been the same mild and lovely look. So shall we know the
angels, in their majesty, after death.
4. The old man held one languid arm in his, and the small
tight hand folded to his breast for warmth. It was the hand
she had stretched out to him with her last smile'; the hand
that had led him on through all their wanderings'. Ever and
anon he'pressed it to his lips; then hugged it to his breast
again, murmuring that it was warmer now, and, as he said it,
he looked in agony: to those who stood around, as if imploring
them to help her.NEW SIXTH READER.
5. She was dead, and past all help, or need of help. The
ancient rooms she had seemed to fill with life, even while
her own was waning fast', the garden she had tended', the
eyes she had gladdenecld, the noiseless haunts of many a
thoughtless hour-, the paths she had trodden, as it were, but
yesterday, could know her no more'.
6. " It is not," said the schoolmaster, as'he bent down to
kiss her on the cheek, and gave his tears free vent, "it is not
in this world that Heaven's justice ends. Think what it is,
compared with the world to which her young spirit has winged
its early flight, and say, if one deliberate wish, expressed in
solemn tones above this bed, could call her back to life', which
of us would utter' it?"
7. She had been dead two days. They were all about her
at the time, knowing that the end was drawing on. She died
soon after daybreak.  They had read and talked to her in the
earlier portion of the night; but, as the hours crept on, she
sank to sleep. They could tell by what she faintly uttered in
her dreams, that they were of her journeyings with the old
man; they were of no painful scenes, but of those who had
helped them, and used them kindly; for she often said " God
bless you!" with great fervor.
8. Waking, she never wandered in her mind but once, and
that was at beautiful music, which, she said, was in the air.
God knows. It may have been. Opening her eyes, at last,
from a very quiet sleep, she begged that they would kiss her
once again. That done, she turned to the old man, with a
lovely smile upon her face, such, they said, as they had never
seen, and could never forget, and clung, with both her arms,
about his neck. She had never murmured or complained;
but, with a quiet mind, and manner quite unaltered, save that
she every day became more earnest and more grateful to them,
faded like the light upon the summer's evening.
9. The child who had been her little friend, came there,
almost as soon as it was day, with an offering of dried flowers,
which he begged them to lay upon her breast. Hie told them
of his dream again, and that it was of her being restored to
them, just as she used to be. He begged hard to see her:
saying, that he would be very quiet, and that they need not
fear his being alarmed for he had sat alone by his younger79.
brother all day long when he was dead, and he had felt glad
to be so near him. They let him have his wish; and, indeed,
he kept his word, and was, in his childish way, a lesson to
them all.
10. Up to that time, the old man had not spoken once, except to her, or stirred from the bedside. But, when he saw
her little favoritet he was moved as they had not seen him yet,
and made as though he would have him come nearer. Then,
pointing to the bed, he burst into tears for the first time, and
they who stood by, knowing that the sight of this child had
done him good, left.them alone together.
11. Soothing him with his artless talk of her, the child persuaded him to take some rest, to walk abroad, to do almost as
he desired him. And, when the day came, on which they
must remove her, in her earthly shape, from earthly eyes forever, he led him away, that he might not know when she was
taken from him. They were to gather fresh leaves and berries
for her bed.
12. And now the bell, the bell she had so often heard by
night and day, and listened to with solemn pleasure, almost
as a living voice, rung its remorseless toll for her, so young, so
beautiful, so good.  Decrepit age, and vigorous life, and
blooming youth, and helpless infancy, on crutches, in the
pride of health and strength, in the full blush of promise, in
the mere dawn of life, gathered round her. Old men were
there, whose eyes were dim and senses failing, grandmothers,
who might have died ten years ago, and still been' old, the
deaf, the blind, the lame, the palsied, the living dead, in many
shapes and forms, to see the closing of that early grave.
13. Along the crowded path they bore her now, pure as the
newly fallen snow that covered it, whose day on earth had
been as fleeting. Under that porch where she had sat, when
Heaven, in its mercy, brought her to that peacefuil spot, she
passed again, and the old church received her in its quiet shade.
1IXI. - ROMANTIC STORY.
STALACTITES; (pro. sta-lac'-tites), lime in the shape of icicles,
formed by drippings, and hanging from the roof.
Fiji; (pro. Fee-jee'), a cluster of islands in the South Pacific.
1. THERE is a cavern'in the island of Hoonga, one of the
Tonga islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, which can only
be entered by diving into the sea', and which has no other
light, than that which is reflected from the bottom of the
water. A young chief discovered it accidentally, while
diving after a turtlet, and the use which he made of his
discovery, will probably be sung in more than one European
language', so beautifully is it adapted for a tale in verse.
2. There was a tyrannical governor at Iloonga, against
whom one of the chiefs formed a plan of insurrection.  It
was betrayed', and the chief, with all his family and kin,
was ordered to be destroyed'. He had a beautiful daughter,
betrothed to a chief of high rank, and she also was included'
in the sentence.  The youth who had found the cavern, and
had kept the secret to himself, loved' this damsel. He told
her the danger in time, and persuaded her to trust to him.
They got into a canoe; the place of her retreat was described
to her on the way to it,-these women swim like mermaids',
-she dived after him-, and rose in the cavern'. In the
widest part it is about fifty feet&gt;; its medium hight being
about the same, and it is hung with stalactites.
3. Here, he brought her the choicest food', the finest
clothing', mats for her bed', and sandal oil to perfume
herself with. Here, he visited her as often as was consistent
with prudence, and here, as may be imagined, this Tonga
Leander, wooed and won the maid, whom, to make the interest complete, he had long loved in secret, when he had no
hope'.  Meantime he prepared, with all his dependents,
male and female, to emigrate in secret to the Fiji islands.
4. The intention was so well concealed, that they embarked in safety&gt;, and his people asked him, at the point of
their departure, if he would not take with him a Tonga
wife'; and, accordingly, to their great astonishment, having
steered close to the rock, he desired them to wait while hewent into the sea to fetch" her, jumped overboard, and just
as they were beginning to be seriously alarmed at his long
disappearance', he rose with his mistress from the water.
This story is not deficient in that which all such stories
should have', to be perfectly delightful'; a fortunate conclusion. The party remained at the Fijis till the oppressor
died', and then returned to Hoonga, where they enjoyed a
long and happy life.
XII.- THE LONE INDIAN.
MOHAWKS; a tribe of Indians who formerly lived in the state of
New York.
1. FOR many a returning autumn, a lone Indian was seen
standing at the consecrated spot we have mentioned; but,
just thirty years after the death of Soonseetah, he was
noticed for the last time. His step was then firm, and his
figure erect, though he seemed old and way-worn. Age had
not dimmed the fire of his eye, but an,xpression of deep
melancholy had settled on his wrinkled brow.  It was
Powontonamo"; he who had once been the eagle of the
Mlohawks. He came to lie down and die beneath the broad
oak, which shadowed the grave of Sunny-eye.
2. Alas! the white man's ax" had been there. The tree
that he had planted was dead'; and the vine, which had
leaped so vigorously from branch to branch, now yellow
and withering, was falling to the ground. A deep groan
burst from the soul of the savage.  For thirty wearisome
years, he had watched that oak, with its twining tendrils.
They were the only things left in the wide world for him to
love', and they were gone.
3. He looked abroad. The hunting-land of his tribe was
changed, like its chieftain. No light canoe now shot down
the river, like a bird upon the wing. The laden boat of the
white man alone broke its smooth surface. The Englishman's road wound like a serpent around the banks of the
Mohawk'; and iron hoofs had so beaten down the war-path,
that a hawk's eye could not discover an Indian track. The
last wigwam was destroyed&gt;; and the sun looked boldly downNEW SIXTH READER.
upon spots he had only,visited by stealth-, during thousands
and thousands of moons.
4. The few remaining trees, clothed in the fantastic
mourning of autumn-; the long line of heavy clouds melting
away before the evening sun-; and the distant mountain, seen
through the blue mist of departing twilight', alone remained
as he had seen them in his boyhood. All things spoke a sad
language to the heart of the desolate Indian.  "Yes'," said
he, "the young oak and the vine are like the Eagle and the
Sunny-eye.  They are cut down', torn-' and trampled' on.
The leaves are falling, and the clouds are scattering like my
people. I wish I could once more see the trees standing
thick, as they did when my mother held me to her bosom,
and sung the warlike deeds of the Mohawks."
5. A mingled expression of grief and anger passed over
his face, as he watched a loaded boat in its passage across the
stream. "The white man carries food to his wife and children, and he finds them  in his hone'," said he; "where are
the squaw  and  pappoose of the red' man?   They are
here'!"  As he spoke, he fixed his eye thoughtfully on the
grave.  After a gloomy silence, he again looked round upon
the fair scene, with a wandering and troubled'gaze.  "The
pale' face may like it," murmured he; " but an Indian' can
not die here in peace-."  So saying', he broke his bowstring', snapped his arrows', threw them on the burial-place
of his fathers', and departed forever'.
REMARK.- The words "down," "torn," and "trampled," in the
last paragraph but one, and "string," "arrows," "fathers," and
"forever," in the last paragraph, are examples of inflection which
may, perhaps, more appropriately come under the head of " series;"
but, by examining them, it will be found, that the rule which gives
them the falling inflection wherever the sense is complete, and that
which requires the last but one to be the rising inflection, are applicable in these cases. Indeed, the rule for series is substantially the
combination of these two principles, with that of emphasis, as laid
down in Rule II.XIII. -TO THE DEAD.
FR1OM BRAINARD.
JOiN G. C. BRAINARD was born in Connecticut, in 1796, and was educated for the bar. In the circumstances of his life and death, he reminds
one of Henry Kirke White; but as a poet, he was very much White's
superior. He died of consumption, in New York, 1828.
1. How many mow are dead to me'
That live to others yet'!
How many are alive to me
Who crumble in their graves, nor see
That sickening, sinking look, which we,
Till dead, can ne'er forget.
2. Beyond the blue seas, far away,
Most wretchedly alone,
One died in prison', far away,
Where stone on stone shut oult the day,
And never hope or comfort's ray
In his lone dungeon shone.
3. Dead to the world', alive to me',
Though months and years have pass'd';
In a lone hour, his sigh to me
Comes like the hum of some wild bee',
And then his form and face I see,
As when I saw him last.
4. And one, with a bright lip, and cheek,
And eye, is dead' to me.
How pale the bloom of his smooth cheek"!
His lip was cold'--it would not speak:
His heart was dead-for it did not break,
And his eye', for it did not see'.
5. Then for the living- be the tomb',
And for the dead', the smile';
Engrave oblivion on the tomb
Of pulseless life and deadly bloom;
l)im is such glare; but bright the bloom
Around the funeral pile.XIV. --THE MUSIC OF NATURE.
FROM WILLIS.
NATHANIEL P. WILLIS, an American poet, was born in Portland, in
1807, but soon removed to Boston. He is the author of many popular
prose and poetical works. He has for a number of years resided in
New York, and has been the editor of several periodicals.
1. THERE is a melancholy music in autumn. The leaves
float sadly about with a look of peculiar desolation&gt;, waving
capriciously in the wind, and falling with a just audible
sound, that is a very sigh for its sadness. And then, when
the breeze is fresher, though the early autumn months are
mostly still, they are swept on with a cheerful rustle over
the naked harvest fields, and about in the eddies of the
blast&gt;; and though I have, sometimes, in the glow of exercise, felt my life securer in the triumph of the brave contest,
yet, in the chill of the evening, or when any sickness of the
mind or body was on me, the moaning of those withered
leaves has pressed down my heart like a sorrow&gt;, and the
cheerful fire, and the voices of my many sisters, might scarce
remove' it.
2. Then for the music of winter'. I love to listen to the
falling of snow. It is an unobtrusive and sweet" music.
You may temper your heart to the serenest mood, by its low
murmur. It is that kind of music, that only obtrudes upon
your ear when your thoughts come languidly.  You need
not hear it, if your mind is not idle. It realizes my dream
of another world, where music is intuitive like a thought-,
and comes only when it is remembered.
3. And thefrost' too has a melodious "ministry."   You
will hear its crystals shoot in the dead of a clear night, as if
the moonbeams were splintering like arrows on the ground;
and you will listen to it the more earnestly, that it is the
going on of one of the most cunning and beautiful of
nature's deep mysteries. I know nothing so wonderful as
the shooting of a crystal. God has hidden its principle as
yet from the inquisitive eye of the philosopher, and we
must be content to gaze on its exquisite beauty, and listen,
in mute wonder, to the noise of its invisible workmanship.85
It is too fine a knowledge for us.  WVe shall comprehend
it, when we know how the morning stars sang together.
4. You would hardly look for music in the dreariness of
early winter. But, before the keener frosts set in, and while
the warm winds are yet stealing back occasionally, like regrets of the departed summer, there will come a soft rain or
a heavy mist', and when the north wind returns', there will
be drops suspended like ear-ring jewels, between the filaments of the cedar tassels, and in the feathery edges of
the dark green hemlocks&gt;, and, if the clearing up is not
followed by the heavy wind', they will be all frozen in their
places like well set gems.  The next morning, the warm sun
comes out', and by the middle of the warm dazzling forenoon', they are all loosened from the close touch which sustained them, and they will drop at the lightest motion.
5. If you go upon the south side of the wood at that hour,
you will hear music.  The dry foliage of the summer's
shedding is scattered over the ground`, and the round, hard
drops ring out clearly and distinctly, as they are shaken
down with the stirring of the breeze. It is something like
the running of deep and rapid water`, only more fitful' and
merrier' but to one who goes out in nature with his heart
open', it is a pleasant music', and, in contrast with the stern
character of the season, delightful.
6. Winter has many other sounds that give pleasure to
the seeker for hidden sweetness'; but they are too rare and
accidental to be described distinctly. The brooks have a
sullen and muffled murmur under their frozen surface'-; the
ice in the distant river heaves up with the swell of the
current', and falls again to the bank with a prolonged echo-;
and the woodman's ax rings cheerfully out from  the bosom
of the unrobed forest.  These are, at best, however, but
melancholy' sounds, and, like all that meets the eye in that
cheerless season, they but drive in the heart upon itself. I
believe it is ordered in God's wisdom. We forgets ourselves
in the enticement of the sweet summer. Its music and its
loveliness win away the senses that link up the affections&gt;,
and we need a hand to turn us back tenderly, and hide from
us the outward idols', in whose worship we are forgetting
the high and more spiritual altars.McGUFFEY'S

XV. - THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.
FROM LONGFELLOW.
HENRY W. LONGFELLOW was born in Portland, in 1807, and entered Bowdoin College at the age of fourteen. He held a professorship of modern larn.
guages in the same institution, and in 1836 received the appointment to
a professorship of the same kind in Harvard University at Cambridge,
where he has since resided. His reputation as a writer is well known.
He may be ranked among the first poets of the age.
1. UNDER a spreading chestnut tree
The village smithy stands-,
The smith, a mighty man is he,
With large and sinewy hands';
And the muscles of his brawny arms
Are strong as iron bands.
2. His hair is crisp, and black, and long';
His face is like the tan';
His brow is wet with honest sweat;
IIe earns whate'er he can,
And looks the whole world in the face,
For he owes not any man.
3. Week in', week out', from morn' till night',
You can hear his bellows blow-;
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge
With measur'd beat and slow',
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,
When the evening sun is low.
4. And children coming home from school
Look in at the open door';
They love to see the flaming forge',
And hear the bellows roar',
And catch the burning sparks that fly
Like chaff from a threshing-floor.
5. He goes, on Sunday, to the church,
And sits among his boys";
He hears the parson pray and preach',
He hears his daughter's voice,
Singing in the village choir,
And it makes his heart rejoice.
6. It sounds to him like her mother's voice,
Singing in Paradise'lHe needs must think of her once more,
IHow in the grave she lies-;
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes
A tear out of his eyes.
7. Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,
Onward through life he goes';
Each morning sees some task begin,
Each evening sees it close';
Something attempted, something done,
Has earn'd a night's repose.
8. Thanks"`, thanks to thee, my worthy friend',
For the lesson thou hast taught'!
Thus, at the flaming forge of life',
Our fortunes must be wrought-,
Thus, on its sounding anvil-, shaped
Each burning deed and thought-.
XVI.- THE THUNDER STORM.
FROM GEORGE D. PRENTICE.
1. I never was a man of feeble courage. There are few
scenes of either human or elemental strife", upon which I
have not looked with a brow of daringo. I have stood in
the front of the battle when the swords were gleaming and
circling around me like fiery serpents in the air'. I have
seen these things with a swelling soul, that knew not, that
reeked not danger.
2. But there is something in the thunder's voice, that
makes me tremble like a child.  I have tried to overcome
this unmanly weakness.  I have called pride to my aid'; 1
have sought for moral courage -in the lessons of philosophy,
but it avails me nothing. At the first low moaning of the
distant cloud-, my heart shrinks and dies within me.
3. My involuntary dread of thunder had its origin in an
incident that occurred when I was a boy of ten years.  I had
a little cousin, a girl of the same age with myself, who had
been the constant companion of my youth. Strange, that,
after the lapse of many years, that occurrence should be so
familiar to me`! I can see the bright young creature', herNEW SIXTH READER.
eyes flashing like a beautiful gem', her free locks streaming
as in joy upon the rising gale-, and her cheeks glowing like a
ruby-, through a wreath of transparent snow'.
4. Her voice had the melody and joyousness of a bird's,'
and when she bounded over the wooded hill or fresh green
valley, shouting a glad answer to every voice of nature, and
clapping her little hands in the ecstasy of young existence',
she looked as if breaking away, like a free nightingale, from
the earth, and going off where all things are beautiful like
her'.
5. It was a morning in the middle of August. The little
girl ha(d been passing some days at m.y father's house, and
she was now to return home. Her path lay across the fields,
and gladly I became the companion of her walk. I never
knew a summer morning more beautiful and still.  Only one
little cloud was visible, and that seemed as pure, and white,
and peaceful', as if it had been the incense-smoke of some
burning censer of the skies.
6. The leaves hung silent in the woods', the waters in
the bay had forgotten their undulations", the flowers were
bending their heads, as if dreaming of the rainbow and dew",
and the whole atmosphere was of such a soft and luxurious
sweetness', that it seemed a cloud of roses scattered down by
the hands of Peri, from the afar-off garden of Paradise'.
The green earth and the blue sea lay around, in their boundlessness, and the peaceful sky bent over and blessed them.
7. The little creature at my side was in a delirium of
happiness, and her clear, sweet voice came ringing upon the
air as often as she heard the tones of a favorite bird, or
found some strange and' lovely flower in her frolic wanderings. The unbroken and almost supernatural stillness of
the day continued until noon.  Then, for the first time, the
indications of an approaching tempest became manifest.
8. On the summit of a mountain, at the distance of
about a mile, the folds of a dark cloud became suddenly
visible, and, at the same instant, a hollow roar came down
upon the winds, as if it had been the sound of waves in a
rocky cavern. The cloud rolled out like a banner unfolded
upon the air, but still the atmosphere was as calm, and the
leaves as motionless as before; and there was not even aquiver among the sleeping waters, to tell of the coming hurricane.
9. To escape the tempest was impossible. As the only
resort, we fled to an oak that stood at the foot of a tall and
ragged precipice. Here we stood, and gazed almost breathlessly upon the clouds, marshaling themselves like bloody
giants in the sky. The thunder was not frequent, but every
burst was so fearful', that the young creature who stood by
me, shut her eyes convulsively, and clung with desperate
strength to my arm, and shrieked as if her heart would
break.
10. A few minutes, and the storm was upon us. During
the hight of its fury, the little girl lifted her finger toward
the precipice that towered over us. I looked, and saw
there a purple light.  And the next moment, the clouds
opened, the rocks tottered to their foundations, a roar like
the groan of the universe filled the air, and I felt myself
blinded, and thrown, I know not whither. How long I
remained insensible, I can not tell'; but when consciousness
returned, the violence of the tempest was abating, the roar
of the winds was dying in the tree-tops, and the deep
tones of thunder-clouds came in fainter murmurs from the
eastern hills.
11. I arose, and looked tremblingly and almost deliriously
around. She was there, the dear idol of my infant love,
stretched out upon the green earth. After a moment of
irresolution, I went up and looked upon her. The handkerchief upon her neck was slightly rent, and a single dark
spot upon her bosom told where the pathway of death had
been. At first, I clasped her to my breast with a cry of
agony, and then laid her down, and gazed upon her face'
almost with feelings of calmness.
12. Her bright, disheveled hair clustered sweetly around
her brow; the lo6ok of terror had faded from her lips, and
infant smiles were pictured there; the rose tinge upon her
cheeks was lovely as in life; and, as I pressed them to my
own, the fountains of tears were opened, and I wept as if
my heart were waters. I have but a dim recollection of
what followed. I only know, that I remained weeping and
motionless till the coming twilight, and I was taken tenderly
8NEW SIXTH READER.
by the hand, and'led away where I saw the countenances of
parents and sister.
13. Many years have gone by on the wings of light and
shadow, but the scenes I have portrayed still come over me, at
times, with terrible distinctness. The oak yet stands at the
base of the precipice, but its limbs are black and dead, and the
hollow trunk looking upward to the sky, as if "calling to the
clouds for drink," is an emblem of rapid and noiseless decay.
14. A year ago, I visited the spot, and the thought of by
gone years came mournfully back to me. I thought of the
little innocent being who fell by my side, like some beautiful
tree of Spring, rent up by the whirlwind in the midst of
blossoming. But I remembered, and 0, there was joy in the
memory, that she had gone where no lightnings slumber in
the folds of the rainbow cloud, and where the sunlit waters
are broken only by the storm-breath of Omnipotence.
XVII. - THE ARTIST SURPRISED.
1. IT may not be known to all the admirers of the genius
of Albrecht Durez, that that famous engraver was endowed
with a better half, so peevish in temper, that she was the
tornlent not only of his own life, but also of his pupils and
domestics. Some of the former were cunning enough to
purchase peace for themselves by conciliating the common
tyrant, but woe to those unwilling-or unable to offer aught in
propitiation.  Even the wiser ones were spared only by
having their offenses visited upon a scape-goat.
2. This unfortunate individual was Samuel Duhobret, a
disciple whom Durez had admitted into his school out of
charity.  He was employed  in painting signs and the
coarser tapestry then used in Germany. He was about forty
years of age, little, ugly, and humpbacked; he was the butt
of every ill joke among his fellow disciples, and was picked
out as an object of especial dislike by Madame Durez. But
he bore all with patience, and ate, without complaint, the
scanty crusts given him every day for dinner, while his companions often fared sumptuously.91
3. Poor Samuel had not a spice of envy or malice in his
heart. He would, at any time, have toiled half the night to
assist or serve those who were wont oftenest to laugh at him,
or abuse him loudest for his stupidity. True, he had not the
qualities of social humor or wit, but he was an example of
indefatigable industry. He came to his studies every morning at day-break, and remained at work until sunset. Then
he retired into his lonely chamber, and wrought for his
own amusement.
4. Duhobret labored three years in this way, giving himself no time for exercise or recreation.  He said nothing to a
single human being of the paintings he had produced in the
solitude of his cell, by the light of his lamp. But his bodily
energies wasted and declined under incessant toil.  There
were none sufficiently interested in the poor artist, to mark
the feverish hue of his wrinkled cheek, or the increasing
attenuation of his mis-shapen frame.
5. None observed that the uninviting pittance set aside
for his mid-day repast, remained for several days untouched.
Samuel made his appearance regularly as ever, and bore,
with the same meekness, the gibes of his fellow-pupils, or
the taunts of Madame Durez, and worked with the same
untiring assiduity, though his hands would sometimes tremble, and his eyes become suffused, a weakness probably owing
to the excessive use he had made of them.    X
6. One morning, Duhobret was missing at the scene of
his daily labors. His absence created much remark, and
many were the jokes passed upon the occasion. One surmised this, and another that, as the cause of the phenomenon, and it was finally agreed that the poor fellow must
have worked himself into an absolute skeleton, and taken his
final stand in the glass frame of some apothecary, or been
blown away by a puff of wind, while his door happened to
stand open. No one thought of going to his lodgings to
look after him or his remains.
7. Meanwhile, the object of their mirth was tossing on a
bed of sickness. Disease, which had been slowly sapping
the foundations of his strength, burned in every vein; his
eyes rolled and flashed in delirium; his lips, usually so
silent, muttered wild and incoherent words. In his days ofhealth, poor Duhobret had his dreams, as all artists, rich or
poor, will sometimes have. He had thought that the fruit
of many years' labor, disposed of to advantage, might procure him enough to live, in an economical way, for the rest
of his life. He never anticipated fame or fortune; the hight
of his ambition or hope was, to possess a tenement large
enough to shelter him from the inclemencies of the weather,
with means enough to purchase one comfortable meal per
day.
8. Now, alas! however, even that one hope had deserted
him. He thought himself dying, and thought it hard to die
without one to look kindly upon him, without the words'of
comfort that might soothe his passage to another world. He
fancied his bed surrounded by fiendish faces, grinning at
his sufferings, and taunting his inability to summon power
to disperse them. At length the apparitions faded away,
and the patient sunk into an exhausted slumber.
9. He awoke unrefreshed; it was the fifth day he had
lain there neglected. His mouth was parched; he turned
over, and feebly stretched out his hand toward the earthen
pitcher, from which, since the first day of his illness, he had
quenched his thirst. Alas! it was empty! Samuel lay for
a few moments thinking what he should do. He knew he
must die of want, if he remained there alone; but to whom
could he apply for aid in procuring sustenance?
10. An idea seemed, at -last, to strike him. He arose
slowly, and with difficulty, from the bed, went to the other
side of the room, and took up the picture he had painted
last. He resolved to carry it to the shop of a salesman, and
hoped to obtain for it sufficient to furnish him with the
necessaries of life for a week longer. Despair lent him
strength to walk, and to carry his burden. On his way, he
passed a house, about which there was a crowd. He drew
nigh; asked what was going on, and received for an answer,
that there was to be a sale of many specimens of art, collected by an amateur in the course of thirty years. It has
often happened that collections made with infinite pains by
the proprietor, were sold without mercy or discrimination
after his death.
11. Something whispered to the weary Duhobret, that here93
would be the market for his picture. It was a long way yet
to the house of the picture-dealer, and he made up his mind
at once. He worked his way through the crowd, dragged
himself up the steps, and, after many inquiries, found the
auctioneer. That personage was a busy, important-like man,
with a handful of papers; he was inclined to notice somewhat roughly the interruption of the lean, sallow hunchback, imploring as were his gesture and language.
12. "What do you call your picture?" at length, said he,
carefully looking at it. " It is a view of the Abbey of Newbourg, with its village, and the surrounding landscape,"
replied the eager and trembling artist.
13. The auctioneer again scanned i4 contemptuously, and
asked what it was worth. " Oh, that is what you please;
whatever it will bring," answered Duhobret. " Hem! it is
too odd to please, I should think; I can promise you no
more than three thalers."
14. Poor Samuel sighed deeply. He had spent on that
piece the nights of many months. But he was starving
now; and the pitiful sum offered would give bread for a few
days. He nodded his head to the auctioneer, and retiring
took his seat in a corner.
15. The sale began. After some paintings and engravings
had been disposed of, Samuel's was exhibited. "Who bids
at three thalers? Who bids?" was the cry. Du-hobret listened eagerly, but none answered.  "Will it find a purchaser?" said he, despondingly, to himself. Still there was
a dead silence. He dared not look up; for it seemed to him
that all the people were laughing at the folly of the artist,
who could be insane enough to offer so worthless a piece at a
public sale.
16. "What will become of me?" was his mental inquiry.
"That work is certainly, my best;" aAd he ventured to steal
another glance. "Does it not seem that the wind actually
stirs those boughs and moves those leaves! How transparent is the water! What life breathes in the animals that
quench their thirst at that spring! How that steeple shines!
IHow beautiful are those clustering trees!"  This was the last
expiring throb of an artist's vanity. The ominous silence continued, and Samuel sick at heart, buried his face in his hands.NEW SIXTH READER.
17. "Twenty-one thalers!" murmured a faint voice, just
as the auctioneer was about to knock down the picture.
The stupefied painter gave a start of joy. He raised his
head and looked to see from whose lips those blessed words
had come. It was the picture-dealer, to whom he had first
thought of apylying.
18. "Fifty thalers," cried a sonorous voice. This time a
tall man in black was the speaker. There was a silence of
hushed expectation.  "One hundred thalers," at length
thundered the picture-dealer.
19. "Three hundred!"  "Five hundred!"  "One thousand!"  Another profound silence, and the crowd pressed
around the two opponents, who stood opposite each other
with eager and angry looks.
20. "Two thousand thalers!" cried the picture-dealer,
and glanced around him triumphantly, when he saw his
adversary hesitate. "'Ten thousand!" vociferated the tall
man, his face crimson with rage, and his hands clinched convulsively.  The dealer grew paler; his frame shook with
agitation; he made two or three efforts, and at last cried out
"Twenty thousand!"
21. His tall opponent was not to be vanquished. He bid
forty thousand.  The dealer stopped; the other laughed a
low laugh of insolent triumph, and a murmur of admiration
was heard in the crowd. It was too much for' the dealer, he
felt his peace was at stake.  "Fifty thousand!" exclaimed
he in desperation. It was the tall man's turn to hesitate.
Again the whole crowd were breathless. At length, tossing
his arms in defiance, he shouted "One hundred thousand!"
The crest fallen picture-dealer withdrew; the tall man victoriously bore away the prize.
22. How was it, meanwhile, with Duhobret, while this exciting scene was going on? He was hardly master of his
senses. He rubbed his eyes repeatedly, and murmured to
himself, "After such a dream, my misery will seem more
cruel!" When the contest ceased, he rose up bewildered,
and went about asking first one, then another, the price of
the picture just sold. It seemed that his apprehension could
not at once be enlarged to so vast a conception.
23. The possessor was proceeding homeward, when a de95
crepit, lame, and humpbacked invalid, tottering along by the
aid of a stick, presented himself before him. He threw him
a piece of money, and waved his hand as dispensing with his
thanks. "May it please your honor," said the supposed beggar, "I am the painter of that picture!" and again he rubbed
his eyes.
24. The tall man was Count Dunkelsback, one of the
richest noblemen in Germany. He stopped, took out his
pocket-book, tore out a leaf, and wrote on it a few lines.
"Take it, friend," said he; "it is a check for your money.
Adieu."
