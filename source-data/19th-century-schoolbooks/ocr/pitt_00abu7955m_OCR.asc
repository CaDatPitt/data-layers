Benjamin Franklin. Franklin is the general name ; Benjamin is
the speciﬁc 5 together they constitute a complex noun.
Mr. I/Villiam Barcklay,——a complex noun.
General Z. Taylor,—-a complex noun.
Mrs. E. Thornton,——a complex noun.
Let other examples of complex nouns be mentioned.
5. A noun in apposition with two or more nouns, is put in the
plural. .
5  Ho \

Some passive and intransitive verbs have the same case
after as before them when both Words refer to the same
person or thing; as, it is he. His name is called Jolm.

No'rE.——1. This rule is chieﬂy applicable to the verbs to be, to

. become, and some other intransitive verbs, and also to some transitive

111 the passive form 5 such as denote to name, to render, to make,
and the like.
. 2. Adjectives and participles are often joined with such verbs to
form the predicate 5 as, The apple is ripe 5 the day is dawning.
3. A few transitive verbs in the active form, are followed by
nouns in the objective case of the same signiﬁcation as the nomin-
ative as, It means nothing5 verb signiﬁes a word. ‘

REMARKS.

l. The nominative or objective caseis used after Inﬁnitives or
participles, according as either case is used before the Inﬁnitive or
participle.

No'rE.—To determine what case the noun following the Inﬁni-
tive or participle IS in, inquire what other word in the sentence
means the same person or thing. 5 '

I am tired of being an idler. In what case is idler’! Why’!

I cannot hear the thought of being an exile from my country. Ex-
ile is the nominative after being, in the same case with_ I.

* Several proper nouns which distinguish an individual are always
put in apposition; as, William Pitt.—-G. Brown.

Nouns common or proper of dissimilar import may be parsed as
adjectives when they become qualifying or distinguishing words;
as, President Madison, Lake Erie, «Sac.--Stmborn.

100 SELECTIONS FOR

And bears his blushing honors thick upon him:

The third day, comes a ﬁ'ost, a killing frost;

And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely

His greatness is a1 ripening,—— nips his root,

“ And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur’d 5

Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,

This many summers in a sea of glory;

But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride

At length broke under me; and now has left me,
Weary, and old with service, to the mercy 10
Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.

Vain pomp, and glory of this world, I hate ye;

I feel my heart new open’d: 0, how wretched,

Is that poor man, that hangs on princes’ favors!

There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to, 15

That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,

Never to hope again.— ‘
Why, how now, Cromwell? 20

Cromwell.-—I have no power to speak, sir.

Wolsey.-— 7, What, amaz’d
At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder,
A great man should decline P Nay, an you weep,
I am fallen indeed. . -I 25

C'rom.~——HoW does your grace?

Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.

These ruin’d pillars, out of pity, ta.ken

O, ’tis a burden, Cromwell, ’tis a burden, 5
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.

Orom.—I am glad, your grace has made that right use
of it. '

Wol.—I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,
(Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,) 10
To endure more miseries, and greater far,
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
What news abroad?

Crom.— The heaviest and the worst,
Is your displeasure with the king. 15
Wol.— God bless him!

C'rom.——The next is, that Sir Thomas Moore is chosen
Lord Chancellor in your place.

Wol.-—-That’s somewhat sudden:

Buthe’s' a learned man.— May he continue 20

For truth’s sake, and his conscience; that his bones

Cromwell, 5
The king has gone beyond me; all my glories
In that one woman I have lost forever:
N 0 sun shall ever usher forth mine honors,
Or gild again thenoble troops that waited
Upon my smiles. GO, get thee fromrme, Cromwell ,1O
I am a poor fallen man, unworthy now
To be thy lord and master; seek the king;
That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
Some little memory of me will stir him 15
(I know his noble nature) not to let

‘ Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,

Neglect him not; make use1 now and provide
For thine own future safety.

Cram. — O my lord, 20
Must I then leave you? must I needs forego
So‘ good, so noble, and so true a master?
Bear Witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord. --
The king shall have my service; but my prayers 25
Forever, and forever, shall. be yours.

Wol. —— Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries; ‘but thou hast forc’d me
Out of thy honest truth to play the woman. 29

Of me more must be heard of, -- say, I taught thee.
Say Wolsey, —-—- that once trod the ways of glory,

And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor,
Found thee a way, out of his Wreck, to rise in;

A sure and safe one, though thy master miss’d it. 5
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin’d me.

Cromwell, I charge thee, ﬂing away ambition;

By that sin fell the angels, how can man then,

The image of his maker, hope to Win by’t ? 9
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
Corruption wins not more than honesty.

Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace, .

To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
Let all the ends thou aim’st at, be thy country’s,

Thy Gorl’s, and truth’s ; then if thou f‘all’st, O Cromwell,
Thou fall’st a blessed martyr. Serve the king: _ 16

. And, -—pr’ythee, lead me in:

There take an inventory of all I have,
To the last penny: ’tis the king’s: my robe,

And my integrity to heaven, is all 20 .

I dare new call my own. 0 Cromwell, Cromweli,
Had I but serv’d my God with half the zeal

I serv’d‘my king, he would not in mine age

Have left me naked to mine enemies.

Cram. —- Good sir, have patience. 25

The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.

12 RULES or SYNTAX.

5. A verb in the imperative mode, and the transitive verbs need,
want, and require, sometimes appear to be used indeﬁnitely, With-
out a nominative; as, Let there be light 5 There required haste in
the business 5 There needs no argument for proving, &c. There
wanted not men Who would, &c. The last expressions have an ac-
tive form with a passive sense, and should perhaps rather be con-
sidered elliptical than Wanting a nominative 3 as, haste is required,
no argument is needed, &c. J

6. The verb which agrees with the nominative case is sometimes
omitted; as, to whom the monarch; replied is omitted. What a
bloom in that person ! The verb is is omitted.

RULE V.

Two or more nouns connected by and, expressed or un-
derstood, generally require a plural verb; as, Charles,

‘Thomas, and George are brothers.

. RULE VI.

. Two or more nominatives singular, connected by or or
nor, require a singular verb; as, Ambition or pride c011-
trols him.

NOTE 1.-—lf one of’ the nouns is plural, the verb must be in the
plural number. - '

Nora 2.‘-—-If‘ the nominatives are of‘ different persons, the verb
must agree with the nearest.

s RULE V1].

The nominative of a collective noun requires a verb in
the singular or plural, according as the noun denotes unity
or plurality; as, the class was large ; my people do not con-
sider. '

NOTE 1.--The plural form of the verb is more commonly used.
N OTE 2.——When the deﬁnitive this, or that, precedes the noun, the
verb must be singular.

RULE VIII.
A noun. or pronoun in the possessive case is governed

RULES or SYNTAX. . 13

by thenoun which denotes the thing owned or possess-
ed; as, Virtue’s reward.

REMARKS.

I. The noun denoting the thing owned or possessed is often omit-
ted, when it can be easily supplied; as, VV e dined at Peter Gar-
rz'ck’s; house is omitted 5 Vital air was adiscovery of Priestley"s;
that is, of Priestley’s discoveries ; the same as to say, vital air was
one of Priestley’s discoveries.

2. Thevpossessive is often governed by a participial clause; as,
Much will depend on the pupz'l’s composing frequently.’ Pupz'l’s is
governed by the clause, “ composing frequently.”

RULE ]X.

The objective case is governed by transitive verbs and
prepositions; as, The sun imparts warmth to the ground.

NoTE.—Participles of transitive verbs likewise govern the ob-

, jective case.

REMARK.

Some intransitive verbs are followed by an objective of kindred
signiﬁcation to their own; as, He dreamed a dream 5 let him die the
death 5 to run therace 5 to sleep the sleep of death; to live a life of
ease. '

Non: ].—Some other intransitive verbs are occasionally follow-

ed by an objective; as, “The brook ran nectar ;” “ to grate harsh 5

thunder 5” he went his way 5 he repented his folly.

NOTE 2.—Some transitive verbs in the passive fo1m are often fol-
lowed by an objective case; as, 4‘ The bishops were allowed their
seats 5” “ I was shown a new potato ;’-’ “ he was forbid the emperor’s
presence.

RULE X.

Nouns ‘which denote time, quantity, measure, distance,
value, or direction are often put in the objective case with-
out a preposition; as, He is ten years old; the rule is afoot
in length.

14 RULES‘ or SYNTAX.

NOTE.-—In analyzing, such nouns with the adjectives joined to’

them are _to be treated as adjuncts, modifying or limiting some oth-
er words in the sentence.
REMARK.

’ 1. The word HOME after the verbs come, go, and the like, is gen-
erally in the objective case without a preposition; as, My intention
is to come home, unless I receive a commission to St. James.

NOTE.-—-When an adjective or an article is joined to the words

' home, north, &c., the preposition is used; as, He has gone to his

OIIIG.

REMARK 2.-—-The words worth, like, near and high, are followed
by the objective case, without a preposition; as, He is like his fath-
er. He is worth a million. He lives near the river.

NOTE.--The preposition is sometimes used after near, nigh and
e. ‘

RULE XI.

TWO OBJECTIVES.

I Verbs signiiying to ask, to teach, to call, to choose, to make,

to render, to constitute, and some others, are often followed
by two objectives; as, He asked me a question; “ and God

i called the firmament Heaven ;” “ God seems to have made

him what he was.” They chose or elected him clerk. Si-
mon he surnamed Peter.

Nor}; l.—The verb cost is sometimes followed by two objec-
tives ; as, It cost me much labor.

N OTE 2.-—-In many cases when the verb is followed by two ob-
jectives, the preposition to, is easily supplied; as, Give me some
drink; that is, give to me ; he offered me a seat; that is, to me.

REMARK I.*—Verbs signifying to ask, to teach, oﬁer, promise,
pay, allow, which in the active form have two objectives, retain one
objective in the passive form; as, I was asked a question; he was
taught grammar; great indulgence was oﬁ"ered me ; I was allowed
great liberty; A shop was promised me.

*See Dr. Crombie, R. XIII, S. N. 1. a

RULES or §"fN'rAx. 15

REMARK 2.-—The preposition is often omitted before the objec-
tive case; as, W0 is me, that is to me.

SPECIAL REMARK.

Any Word, phrase, or sentence, can be.used as a noun
in the nominative or objective case; as, Examine the why
and the how. There is an if in the Way. ﬁnd is a con-
junction.

RULE XII. _

A noun joined with a participle, standing unconnected
with the subject or predicate of the sentence, is in the case
independent; as, The oration having been spoken, the as-
sembly Was dismissed.

N OTE 1.—The noun independent may have adjectives and modi-

’ fying adjuncts. .

NOTE 2.——In analyzing, the case independent or absolute, with
the participle and other modifying Words, may be called an abridged
expression, which may be formed into a complete sentence by chang-

T ing the participle into a verb, and supplying other necessary words ;

as, Tarquinius reigning, Pythagoras came into Italy. Tarquinius
reigning, is an abridged expression and is equivalent to while Tar-
qumzus was reigning.

RULE XI[[.

Nouns and pronouns denoting persons or thingsaddre.§s-
ed, and nouns in abrupt and exclamatory clauses, are in the
case independent.

REMARK. '

Names, titles, captions, and signatures, standing unconnected, are
sometimes parsed as the case independent; they may however be
considered as abridged expressions, to which in analyzing and pars-
ing, such Words can be ‘added as are necessary to complete a sen-
tence.

tor.

Rule V; Chapter IV; that is, this is Rule V, &c.

Herzry .Ma-rtin ; that is, the memoir 0f'Hen1y Martin.

Spectator, Rule V, Chapter IV, are strictly parts of son-
tences, and can be parsed as nouns in the nominative af-
ter the verbs.

RULE XIV.

Pronouns agree With the nouns, or Words for Which
they stand, in gender, number and person; as, Thou, who
speakest; they Went their Way.

REMARKS.

1. Pronouns which refer to two or more nouns connected by. and,
must be in the plural number 5 as, George and Thomas excel in

their studies.

No'rE.—When the nouns refer to the same person or thing, or be-
long to different propositions, the pronoun agrees according to
Rule XIV.

2. Pronouns which refer to two ormore singular nouns connect-
ed byor or nor must be in the singular number.

No'rE.—When the nouns connected are of different persons, the

' ﬁrst person is preferred to the second, and the second to the third.

A 3. The pronoun it refers to nouns without regard to number, gen-
der, or person; to Inﬁnitives, to clauses, and even to Whole para-
graphs. '

4. The pronoun whatever or whatsoever is sometimes used for the
sake of emphasis; as, N o ground whatever 3 when used in this man-
ner it may be treated as an adjective belonging to a noun under-
stood; as, No prudence whatever, i. e., no prudence, whatever pru-
dence may exist, can deviate from this scheme.

No'rE.—It is frequently redundant, or is used indeﬁnitely; and
when so used, may be parsed in apposition with the Inﬁnitive or
clause following; as, “ It is the mark of a generous spirit to forgive
injuries 5” the proper subject of the verb is, to forgive injurzes, and
it is redundant, or unnecessary to the sense; but such a usageils
authorized by the best writers.

5. The pronouns himself, itself, themselves, &c., are used in the V

RULES or svﬁnx. , 17

nominative or objective case, and are frequently a mere repetition
for the sake of emphasis, and in many cases are to be parsed in ap-
position with some noun or pronoun expressed or understood; as,
He himself said it.

6. VVhat is also sometimes used adverbially in the sense ofpart-
ly ; as, I/Vhat with the War, what with the sweat, &c.

RULE XV.

Adjectives belong to nouns which they qualify or de-

ﬁne; as, A tall tree; a high mountain.

No'rE.'—-Adjectives which denote but one, must be joined to a
singular noun 3 those which denote more than one must be joined
to a plural noun ; as This man, these men, two birds, one bird.

NOTE.-A plural adjective is sometimes found with a singular
noun; as, “ A ﬂeet of twenty sail ;” “ forty head of cattle.”

E XAMPLE S .

L Adjectives are frequently separated from the nouns to which
they belong; as, The day is pleasant. Great is the Lord. A river
twenty rods wide.

2. Adjectives are used to modify Inﬁnitives, parts of clauses, and
whole propositions 3 as, To see the sun is pleasant-; to advance was
diﬂicult; to retreat hazardous._ A .

3. Adjectives are used to modify both the action of the verb, and
its subject; as, The wind was blowingfresh 5 he grew old in the ser-
viceof his country.* 3 V

4;’ Adjectives are sometimes used to modify other adjectives ;
as, Deep blue, a witch hazle mineral rod, pale red. ‘

Nora.-Several adjectives are sometimes joined to a single noun;
as, Liverpool deep blue earthern pitchers. ’

5. The adjective is often used alone, the noun with which it
agrees being understood; as, The brave, the righteous.

No'r1«:.—-The adjective is sometimes used indeﬁnitely, without
direct reference to any noun; as, To be wise and good, is to be

great and noble. A noun, however, can generally be supplied in

such instances; as, For one to be wise, is for one to be great, &c.
*Adjectives of this kind are treated by some grammarians as ad-

verbs, or as adjectives qualifying the noun only, but either way is

not according to the sense, for they show both manner and quality, _

and therefore refer to the subject and predicate of‘ the sentence.

18 RULEES or SYNTAX.‘

RULE XVI.

Pronominal adjectives limit the nouns to which they
belong, or are used alone as pronouns; as, This day, few
men, both men, many people, the latter day, some think,
few come, &c.

REMARK.
Each other. One another.’

These elliptical expressions may be explained as follows:

Righteousness and peace have kissed each other ; that is, each
has kissed the other. A

We ought also to love one another; that is, one ought to love, &c.

“* When ye come together to eat, tarry one for another 3” it might
be, for one another. ~

“ Exhort one another daily; let each exhort the other, &c.”

RULE XVII.

Articles deﬁne or limit the signiﬁcation of the nouns to
which they belong; as, ./9 man, an hour, the horse.

NOTE 1.--A or an is joined to nouns in the singular number only,
except when the noun is preceded by the adjective few or many;
as, A few men; agreat many men; or by some collective word,
as, A hundredmen, &c. The is joined to nouns singular or plural.

No-TE 2.-—When an articleand a descriptive adjective belong to
the same noun, the article stands first; as, A good man, the wise
man. '

EXCEPTION.--A sometimes stands after the adjective ma/ny ; as,
Full many a gem; many a ﬂower.

NOTE 3.—-The article the is frequently joined to ‘adverbs in the
comparative or superlative degree, and to adjectives used as nouns ;
as, The more I examine it, the better I like it ; the least of the apos-
tles ; a few, the many, the good. I was astonished not a little.

NOTE 4.-—-When two or more adjectives or nouns refer to the
same individual, the article generally stands before the ﬁrst only;
as, A great and good man; but it is sometimes repeated for the
sake of emphasis ; as, The wise, the virtuous, the patriotic Franklin.

RULE XVIII.

The Inﬁnitive mode follows a verb, noun or actiect-ive.

RULES or SYNTAX. 19 ‘

REMARKS.

A verb in the Inﬁnitive may follow : R

1. Verbs or participles; as, I hope to succeed, wishing to go.

2. Nouns or pronouns, as, A time to die; a desire to improve;
how is it possible for him to succeed ? there is a message for you to
convey. , _

3. Adjectives; as, He is anasious to hear.

4. As, than; as, He is so conceited as to disdain to have anything
to do with books; he desired nothing more than to know his im-
perfections. ‘_ _

5. Adverbs; as, The rope is strong enough to suspend a ton. I
know not how to address you. ~

6. Prepositions; as, VVhat Went ye out for to see '?*—my friend is
about to take his departure.

7. The Inﬁnitive is often used independently; as, To say the least
he has erred in judgment ; “ but to proceed With our argument.”

8. The Inﬁnitive mode is often used in the ofﬁce of’ a verbal noun,
as the nominative case to the verb, and as the objective case after
verbs and prepositions.

9. VVhen the Inﬁnitive denotes purpose or design, it is frequently
preceded by the phrase in order, but this phrase is often omitted.

SPECIAL RULE.

The Inﬁnitive mode has an objective case before it when
that is omitted; as, I believe the sun to be in the centre of
the solar system; I know him to be a man ‘of’ veracityq‘

RULE XIX.

The verbs which follow bid, dare, durst, hear, feel, let,
make, need, see, and their participles, are used in the In-
ﬁnitive Without the sign to; ;t as, He bid him go.

*This form of expression is now obsolete; it occurs in the scrip-
tures and in ancient Writings.

’rThis construction is far less common, and less elegant, in the
English than the Latin language ; still it frequently occurs.

ftThe sign to is retained after these verbs when used in the as.
sive form. The sign is also sometimes retained after make and are.

20 RULES or SYNTAX.

No'rE.—The verbs watch, behold, know, observe, have, command,
ﬁnd, and some others are occasionally followed by the Inﬁnitive
without the sign to.

RULE XX.

1. Participles belong to nouns or pronouns, which they
limit or explain. ‘

2. Present and compound participles govern the same
case as the verbs from which they are derived.

3. Participles are often governed by prepositions; as,
I am weary with hearing him.

REMARKS.

1. Participles preceded by an article. are called participial nouns;
as, By the preaching of repentance.

2. Participles preceded by the article should always be followed
by the prepoition of; by the preaching repentance is incorrect; it
ghould be of repentance.

3. Participles not preceded by the article should not be followed

' by of ; preaching of repentance it should be preaching repentance.

4. Participles are sometimes used indeﬁnitely, or without refer-
ence to. any noun or pronoun expressed ;as, Generally speaking, his
conduct was’ very honorable.

5. Participles like the verbs from which they are derived, have

the same case after as before them ; as, I was not conscious of my *

brother’s being a drunkard; drunhard is in the possessive case with-
out the sign, after being, or as some prefer, in apposition with brother.

6. The participle without the article is sometimes used as a noun
in the nominative or objective case, and still retains its power of
government; as, Not attending to this rule is the causelof a very
common error. ’

'7. Adjectives derived from verbs, and having the form of partici-
ples, are called verbal or participial adjectives.

8. The participle in ing is sometimes used passively; as, Forty
and six years was this temple in building; not in being built.

EXAMPLES.
It is equally so as if one should pretend to feel as much
pain while a friend’s leg is cutting oﬁI—Johnson.

RULES or SYNTAX. 21

The edition of the English poets now printing will do
honor to the English poets.——Life of Johnson.

The nation had cried out loudly against the crime While
it was committing.——Bolinbrohe.

N oTE.-—-The form of expression, is being built, is being committed,
&c., is almost universally condemned by grammarians; but it is
sometimes met with in respectable writers. It occurs most fre-
quently in newspaper paragraphs and in hasty comgositions. See
on the subject, Worcester’s Universal and Critical ictionary.

RULE XXI.

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.

' REMARKS.

1. Adverbs are generally placed near the words which they modi-
fy ; as, He conducts foolishly ; very sick; right onward.

2. Adverbs are sometimes used for adjectives ; as, The then min-
istry; the above discourse ;* to-marrow morning ; the men only.

NoTE.—VVhen only refers to a noun, it should be placed near it
s to avoid ambiguity. '

3. Adverbs are sometimes used as nouns; as, Until now; yet a
little while.

.4. From is sometimes unnecessarily used before whence, thence,
hence; as, From whence art thou, for whence, &o.

5. The adverb there often stands at the beginning of’ a sentence,
without particular reference to any other Word ; as, There are many
who believe, &.c.

6. The word modiﬁed by the‘ adverb is sometimes omitted; as,
I’ll hence to London.

7. Two negatives in the same clause are equivalent to an aﬂirma-
tive; as, Nor did they not perceive, i. e. they did perceive.

8. An adverb sometimes modiﬁes the word a, used in the sense
of’ one; as, Almost a year; not a dollar.

9. The word but used in the sense of only may be treated as an
adverb; as, All are but parts of one stupendous whole; I have but
one request to make.

*Such expressions, though not destitute of authority, are eXceed- _

ingly inelegant and irreconcilable with authority.-Crombie.

22 ‘RULES or SYNTAX.‘

10. As in the sense of so, is an adverb 3 as, As Well; as much.
11. The adverb now frequently stands at the beginning of para-
graphs in argumentative and familiar discourse as a general con-

. nective, without modifying any particular word 3 as, Now, it is evi-

dent, &c.

12. A preposition with its object is sometimes equivalent to an
adverb3 as, In truth, for truly, &c.

13. Adverbs are not unfrequently absolute; that is, they qualify
no particular word, but usually refer to the Whole preceding sen-
‘tence 3 as, Yes, no, therefore,‘ then, however, &c., and not unfre-
quently they are expletives, that is, qualify nothing 3 as, VVhy, well,
there, &.c.—Nutti7z.g. . '

'14». Adverbs sometimes modify ‘prepositions, adjuncts, phrases,
and entire clause33 as, Just below the surface; nearly round the
world 3 Ihear almost in vain 3 independently of these considerations.

RULE XXEL

Prepositions govern the objective case.

REMARKS.

1. But in the sense of except, appears sometimes to be used as . ,.

\

a preposition3 as, All but one.

NOTE.-—Than is sometimes followed by the objectives whom and

which 3 as Alfred, than whom, &c. Beelzeliub, than whom, &c.

92. The article a is in a few instances employed in the sense of a
preposition; as, Simon Peter said I go a [to] ﬁshing.

3. Two or more Words combined are sometimes treated as a com-
pound preposition 3 as, according to, in respect to, in regard to, from
above, from below, as to, as for, over against, instead of, out of, &c.

4. The Words allowing, considering, concerning, during, respect-
ing, supposing, notwithstanding, excepting, past, are sometimes
termed verbal prepositions 3* and also, save and except.

5. Some of the prepositions are occasionally used as adverbs 3 the
noun however, may generally be supplied.

*Some grammarians prefer to treat this class of Words as partici- A

ples, under all circumstances agreeing with the Whole sentence, or
some word understood; and save and except as verbs in the i.mne1'a-
tive mode. ‘

RULES or SYNTAX. 23

6. Prepositions sometimes govern a participial clause, or a simple
sentence. ‘

7. Prepositions are sometimes followed by an adverb; as, From
afar 3 to where.

RULE XXIII.

Conjunctions connect single Words or sentences; as,
He reads and Writes. I soiight the Lord and he heard
Ine.

REMARKS.

1. The conjunctionstﬁthoagh, except, unless and lest, are signs

of the subjunctive mode. '

NoTE.—-If is often omitted before the subjunctive 3 as, “ Had I the
Wings of a dove,” for, if I had 5 “ could I but stand,” for, I could,
&;c. 5 were there no difference, for if there were.

2. The following are corresponding conjunctions.
Thou gh—-yet. As—-as. VVhether—or. S o——as.
Either—-or. As—so. Neither-—nor. Botl1—and.

3. As is sometimes used in the sense of a relative pronoun; as,

Such a scheme as I have seen 5-as may be parsed in the objective
after seen. The ellipsis of that which, those which, &:c., may how-
ever be supplied 3 then as will be treated as a conjunction.

4. The phrases as/if; as though, what though,'are elliptical. p A11‘

intervening clause may be supplied.

5. There are some abridged expressions, which it is convenient
to call compound connectives 3 such as, As well as, inasmuch as, in
order that, but that, &c5 these, however, can generally be analyzed
mtelligibly, and each word may be parsed separately, by supplying
such words as the sense will allow.

6. The word both,* is used as a conjunction, adjective and pro-
noun. 4

‘7. That is used as a conjunction, an adjective and a relative pro-
noun.

SENTENCES TO BE ANALYZED AND PARSED.

We see all this is done, and all this expenditure is in-

curred.

*By a careful analysis it may be found that both is in all cases an
adjective, and that an adjective or relative, but in most grammars
there are other oﬁices assigned them.

24 RULES or SYNTAX.

(This is a compound sentence, consisting of two simple senten-
ces ; and connects them.) i

In order to produce it now, We diminish the produc-
tiveness of all other labor. ﬁnd the only effect is to post-
pone it to a still more distant period.

derstood, to the same words expressed; for which, &c., is a relative
clause, and refers to production. Eithere-—or are corresponding

conjunctions and connect original and acquired.
RULE XXIV.

Interjections have no governing power, and‘ have no
dependence on other words in construction.

REMARKS.

Interjections often stand bef'ore nouns independent, and befbre
whole clauses; as, O virtue! O for a lodge in some vast wilder-
ness! Some words must be supplied before such clauses to com-
plete the sentence ; as, 0- how I long fora lodge, &.c. .

ANALYZING AND PARSING. _

 

MODEL.

SEN'rENcE.—-Those who were skilful in anatomy,
among the ancients, concluded, fiom the outward and in-
ward make of a human body, that it was the Work of a
Being transcendently Wise and powerful.

ANALYZED.

This is a compound sentence, made up of as many simple sen-
tences or clauses as there are verbs in it which are not in the inﬁni-
tive mode, viz : three simple clauses.

No. 1.-—Those among the ancients concluded, &c., is the leading

clause.

No. 2.— Who were skilful in anatomy, is_a relative clause, con-
nected with No. 1, by who referringto those.

' No. 3.——T/tat it was the work of, &c., is a dependent clause, con-
nected with No. 1, by the conjunction “ that.”

The subject of A No. I, is those, modiﬁed lst, by the adjunct
“ among the ancients,” 2d, by the relative clause, “ who were,” &c.

Concluded is the predicate of No. 1, modiﬁed lst, by the adjunct
“ from. the outward” &c., 2d, by the Whole clause “ that it was” «Sec.

The subject of’ N 0.3, is the relative who.

The predicate of N o. 2, is "' were skilful 3”—skilful is modiﬁed by
the adjunct “ in anatomy,” showing in What respect they were skil-
ful. '

The subject of No. 3, is it.

The predicate of No. 3, is “ was the Work.”

Of a Being is the adjunct of Work, and is equivalent to a noun in
the possessive case.

Transcendently modiﬁes ‘-’ wise” and “ povverf'ul3”—wt'se and pow-
erful modify Being.

26 RULES or SYNTAX.

PARSED.

Those is a pronominal adjective, and belongs to the noun persons
understood, or is used without a noun, in the nominative case, plu-
ral, the subject of concluded.

Among is a preposition, and connects ancients with those.

The is an article and limits ancients.

Ancients is a common noun, plural, third person,—,-in the objec-
tive case after the preposition among.

Who is a relative pronoun, referring to those for its antecedent,
nominative case and the subject of Were. .

Were is an irregular intransitive verb, third person, plural, and
agrees with “ who.”

Skilﬁd is a descriptive adjective, united with “ were” to form a
predicate, and describes or qualiﬁes “ who.”

Concluded is a regular intransitive verb, indicative mode, -imper-
fect tense, third person, plural, and agrees with its subject, “ those.”

From is a preposition connecting make With “ concluded,” be-
cause the adjunct “from the outward and inward make,” expresses
the reason why “ those concluded 3”—j‘r0mwith its object, is there-
fore an adjunct of the predicate.

Outward and inward are adjectives connected by and 5 they de-
scribe or qualify the noun “ make.”

Of is a preposition connecting "" body” with “ make.”

Of a human body is the adjunct of make, i. e. it limits the mean-
ing oI".the word make 3-—-the make of what? Ans. “ the make of
a human body.”

That is a conjunction connecting the clause following with the
predicate “ concluded.”

No'rE.—-The other Words can be parsed and explained in a simi-
lar manner. '

The learner is referred to “ Weld’s English Gramrnarg”
Part I, § 35, for other models in analyzing, and to Part
II, § 53, § 54, § 56, &c., for models of “analyzing and

parsing.” ‘

NOTE.-—lt will impart great interest to the exercise of parsing, if
the learner is required to analyze the sentence, and to show what
eifect or relation each word has in the sentence, before he applies
the grammatical terms,-or gives its class or variations. _ ‘

SELECTIONS.

SUGGESTION.

It is the‘ principal object of analyzing and parsing to examine the gram-
matical structure of sentences, and the relations, changes, and modiﬁcations
of words; but in connection with this, it would render the exercise more
interesting, less mechanical, and highly useful in mental training, to consid-
er the import and propriety of every Word, and to inquire whether it is used
in a literal or ﬁgurative sense, and to substitute one Word or expression for
another of similar meaning. I

gether for this purpose, the attention and the sympathy of
the multitude were excited by the ‘anxious looks and eager
inquiries of a female,who was passing from group to group,

with sorrow and agitation painted on her countenance.

16. It was a mother, who could not ﬁnd her son. It
was her only son, and one to whom, from particular cir-3
cumstances, she was very strongly attached. He had
never disobeyed her; he had never given her unnecessary
trouble, and the uncommon maturity of his mental and
moral powers had probably led her to trust him much
more to himself than in any other case would be justi-
ﬁable. V

17. He was twelve years1 old, and she supposed that he
had been safe in the company, but now night had come,
and she could not ﬁnd him. She Went anxiously and sor-
rowfully from family to family, and from friend to friend,
inquiring with deep solicitude, “ Have you seen my son?”

18. He was not to be found. No one had seen him, ..

and the anxious parents left their company, and inqui-
ring carefully by the way, went slowly back to the city
whence they had come.

19. With what anxious and fruitless search they spent

the evening and the following morning, we do not know.
They at last? however ascended to the temple itself They
passed from court to court, now going up the broad ﬂight
of steps which led from one to the other, now Walking
under a lofty colonnade, and now traversing a paved and
ornamented area.

20. At last? in a public part of this ediﬁce, they found
a group collected around a boy, and apparently listening
to what he was saying: the feeling must have been min-

gled with interest, curiosity and surprise. It was their .

son. His uncommon mental and moral maturity had by

some means shown itself to those around him, and they ‘

were deeply interested in his questions and replies.

THE SABBA'1‘H\.—-[WILLIS.]

It Was a pleasant morning, in the time

When the leaves fall — and the bright sun shone out

As when the morning stars first sang together —

So quietly and calmly fell his light

Upon a world at rest. There was no leaf 5
In motion, and the loud Winds slept, and all

Was still. The la’bring herd was grazing

Upon the hill-side quietly——uncal1ed

By the harsh voice of man; and distant sound,

Save from the murmuring Waterfall, came not 10
As usual on the ear. One hour stole on, ’
And then another of the morning, calm

And still as Eden ere the birth of man.

And then broke in the Sabbath chime of bells——-

And -the old man and his descendants went 15

Together to the house of God. I joined

The Well-apparelled crowd. The holy man

Rose solemnly, and breathed the prayer of faith-—

And the gray saint, just1 on the Wing for heaven;

And the fair maid — and the bright haired young man; 20
And the child of cinling looks, just taught to close

The lash of its blue eye the While ;9 — all knelt

In attitude of prayer—— and then the hymn,

Sincere in its low melody, Went up

To worship God. 25

All mournful she hasten’d, nor Wander’d she far,

‘When bleeding, and low, on the heath she descried,

By the light of the moon, her poor Wounded Hussar!

From his bosom that heav’«d, the last torrent Was streaming,
And pale was his Visage, deep mark’d with a scar! 10
And dim Was that eye, once expressively beaming,

‘That melted in love, and that kindled in War!

How smit was poor Adelaide’s heart at the sight!

How bitter she wept e’er the Victim of War? 14

,“ Hast thou come, my fond Love, this last sorrowful night,
To cheer the lone heart of your Wounded Hussar P”

“Thou shalt live,” she replied, “ Heaven’s mercy relieving
Each anguishing wound, shall forbidme to mourn.”

SURRENDER or GRENADA.——-[IR.VING.]

1. The sun had scarcely begun to shed his beams upon
the summits of the snowy mountains which rise above
Grenada, When the Christian camp was in motion.

2. A detachment of horse and foot led by 

ANALYZING AND PARSING. 35

cavaliers, and accompanied by Hernando de Talavera,
bishop of Avila, proceeded to take possession of the
Alhambra and the towers. * '

3. It had been stipulated in the capitulation, that the
detachment sent for the purpose should, not enter by the
streets of the city. A road had, therefore, been opened
outside of the walls, leading by the Puerta de los Moli-
nos (or the Gate of the Mills) to the summit of the Hill
of Martyrs, and across the hill to the postern—gate_ of the
Alhambra. -

4. T When the detachment arrived at the summit of the
hill, the Moorish king came forth from the gate, attended
by a handful of cavaliers, leaving his vizier to deliver up
the place.

5. “ Go, senior,” said he, to the commander of the de-
tachment; “ go and take possession of those fortresses
which Allah has bestowed upon your powerful lord, in
punishment of the sins of the Moors!”

6. He said no more, but passed mournfully on, along by
the same road by which the Spanish cavaliers had come,
descending to the Vega, to meet the catholic sovereigns.

7. The troops entered the Alhambra, the gates of which
were wide open, and all its splendid courts and halls si-
lent and deserted. In the meantime. the christian court
and army poured out of the city of Santa Fe, and ad-
vanced across the vega. A

8. The king and queen, with the prince and princesses,
and the dignitaries and ladies of the court, took the lead;
accompanied by the different orders of monks and friars,
and surrounded by the royal guards, splendidly arrayed.

9. The procession moved slowly forward, and paused
at the village of Armilla, at the distance of half a league
fromthe city. V ‘ A A

10. The sovereigns Waited here with impatience, their
eyes1 fixed on the lofty tower of the Alhambra, Watching
for the appointed signal of possession.

11. The time that had elapsed since the departure of
the detachment, seemed to them more than necessary for
the purpose; and the anxious mind of Ferdinand began
to entertain doubts of some commotion in the city.

12. At length they saw the silver cross, the great stan-
dard of this crusade, elevated on the Torre  la Vela, or
great watch-tower, and sparkling in the sunbeams. This
was done by Hernando de Talavera, bishop of Avila.

13. Beside it was planted the penon of the glorious
apostle St. James; and a great shout of “ Santiago! San-
tiago !” rose throughout the army. Lastly Was reared the
royal standard, by the king of arms; with the shout of
“‘ Castile! Castilel For King Ferdinand and Queen Isa-

ibella 2”

14. The words were echoed by the whole army, with
acclamations that resounded across the Vega.

And all the hunters of the tribe were out.

She poured her griefs. Thou knowest, and thou alone

Calls me and chides me. All that look on me

PREFACE.

THE selections which compose the body of the following Work
are so arranged as to constitute a gradual course of Exercises in
Analyzing and Parsing.

The Rules of Syntax are taken from VVELD’s ENGLISH GRAMMAR

. by permission of the Publishers, and to these rules, and also to the

Grammar "from which they are taken, references are occasionally

made, to assist the learner in explaining idiomatic or diﬂicult pas-

. sages.

As the extracts are fromisome of the most accomplished and ap-
proved writers, the Ornaments of style, Figures of Rhetoric and
Scanning, may be proﬁtably attended to by advanced classes.

The book, may be used by learners in almost any stage of attain-
ment after the elementary principles of Grammar are understood.
The Work is designed to take the place of Pope’s Essay, Thomp-
son’s ‘Seasons, Young’s Night Thoughts, and other entire poems,
which are used as parsing booits in Schools. A variety in the se-
lections, it is believed, will be more proﬁtable and interesting to the
learner, than any single work can be, which exhibits no gradation
in style, and the peculiarities of’ one Writer only.

3. Games and religious ceremonies continued for sev-
eral days, and among the spectators who ﬂocked from
distant quarters, were some noble Tlascalans, the heredi-
tary enemies of Mexico. They were in disguise, hoping
thus to elude detection.  X ,

4. They were recognized, however, and reported to
the monarch. But he only availed himself of the infor-
mation to provide them with honorable entertainment,
and a good place for witnessing the games. This was a
magnanimous act, considering the long cherished hostil-

‘ity between the nations.

5. In his first years, Montezuma was constantly engaged
in war, and frequently led his armies in person. The
Aztec banners were seen in the furthest provinces on-

the Gulf of Mexico, and the distant regions of N icar- ’

agua and Honduras. The expeditions: Were generally
successful; and the limits of the empire were more
Widely extended than at any preceding period.

6. Meanwhile the monarch. was not inattentive to the
interior concerns of the kingdom. He made some im-
portant changes in the courts of justice; a11d carefully
watched over the execution of the laws, which he en-
forced with stern severity.

7. He was in the habit of patrolling the streets of his
capitol in disguise, to make1 himself personally acquainted
with the abuses in it. ‘

8. And with more questionable policy, it is said, he
would sometimes try the integrity of his judges by tempt-
ing them’ with large bribes to swerve from their duty, and
then call the delinquent to strict account ‘for yielding to
the temptation.

9. He liberally recompensed all who served him. He
showed a similar muniﬁcent spirit in his public Works,
constructing and embellishing the temples, bringing wa-
ter into the capitol by a new channel, and establishing a
hospital, or retreat for invalid soldiers, in the city of Col-
huacan.

Twice in the zenith blazed the orb of light;
N0 shade, all sun, insufferably bright!

Then the long line found rest——in coral groves
Silent and dark, Where the sea-lion roves : —

eAnd all on deck, kindling to life again, 5

Sent forth their anxiotis spirits o’er the main.
“ O whence,  waited from Elysium, whence

These perfumes, strangers to the raptured sense?
These boughs of gold, and fruits of heavenly hue,
Tinging with vermeil light the billows blue?
And (thrice, thrice blessed is the eye that spied, 10
The hand that snatch’d it sparkling in the tide)
Whose cunning carved this vegetable bowl,
Symbol of social rites,,and intercourse of soul?”
Such to their grateful ear the gush of springs, '
Who course the ostrich, as away she wings; 15
Sons of the desert! who delight to dwell
’Mid kneeling camels rbund the sacred well:
Who, ere the terrors of his pomp be past,
Fall to the demon in the red’ning. blast.’ '

COLLOQUIAL POWERS or DR. FRANKLIN.——[WIRT.]

1.‘ Never have I known such a ﬁre-side companion as
Dr. Franklin. Great as1 he was, both? as a3 statesman
and a philosopher, he never shone in . a light more win-
ning than when he was seen in a domestic circle.

2. It was once my good fortune to pass two or three
weeks with him, at the house of a private gentleman, in
the back part of Pennsylvania; and we were conﬁned to
the house, during the whole of that time, by the uninter-
mitting constancy and depth of the snows. ~

3. Bpt conﬁnement could never be felt where'Franklin
was an inmate. His cheerfulness and his colloquial ppw-
ers spread around him a perpetual spring. When I speak,
however, of his colloquial powers, I do not mean to awa-

ken any notion analagous to that which Boswell has
given us, when he so frequently mentions the colloquial

powers of Dr. Johnson.

9. It seemed to be as much the effect of the systemat-
ic and salutary exercise of the mind as of its superior

nobles, he was always the same plain man; always most
perfectly at his ease, his faculties in full play, and the fu-ll
orbit of his genius forever clear and unclouded. And
then the stores of his mind were inexhaustible.

1]. He had commenced life with an attention so vigi-
lant, that nothing ‘had escaped his observation; and a
judgment so solid, that every incident was turned to ad-
vantage. His youth had not been wasted in idleness, nor
overcast by intemperance.

12. He had been, all his life,1 a close and deep reader,
as well as? thinker; and, by the force of his own powers,
had wrought up the raw materials, which he had gath-
ered from books, with such exquisite skill and felicity,
that he had added a hundred fold to their original value,

> and justly made them his own.

RULES OF SYNTAX.

-1. Syntax treats of sentences, and teaches the proper
construction of Words in forming them.

CLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES.

Sentences are of four kinds, declaratory, imperative, in-
terrogative and conditional.

./Q declaratory sentence is one in which any thing is sim-
ply aﬂirmed or denied of a subject; as, Time ﬂies : He will
not understand.

.ﬂn imperative sentence is one in which a command isex-
pressed; as, Buy the truth, and sell it not.

ﬂn interrogative sentence is one in which a. question is
asked, as, W110 hath believed our report?

ﬂ conditional sentence is one in which something con-

tingent or hypothetical is expressed; as, Ifit rains: Though I

he slay me.

Sentences are either simple or compound. ./1 simple sen-
tence consists of but one proposition; a compound sentence
consists of two or more simple sentences.

The simple propositions which make up a compound
sentence, are called clauses or members. I

«The leading clause is one on Which the other members
depend. V ‘ '

ﬂ dependent clause is one which makes complete sense
only in connection with another clause.

SIMPLE SENTENCES. '
A simple sentence contains only one subject orinom
inative, and one predicate.

THE PILGR2IM’S PROGRESS.--[MACAULAE]

- It should be constantly borne in mind, that the principal object in;
analyzing and parsing, is to learn how good writers employ language.

L That wonderful book, while it obtains ‘admiration
from the most fastidious critics, is loved by those who are-
too simple to admire it. Doctor J ohnson,9 all whose
studies were desultory, and who hated, as he said, to read
books through, made an exception in favor of the ‘9 Pil-

gr1m’.s Progress.” . _
2. That work, he said, was one of the two or three

works which he wished longer. It was by no common
merit that the illiterate sectary extracted praise like this
from the most. pedantic of critics agd the most bigoted
of Tories. ‘  —

3. In the wildest part of Scotland the “ Pilgrim’s Pro- =

gress” is a greater favorite than “Jack the Giant Killer.”
Every reader knows the straight and narrow path, as well

forward a hundred times.1 '

4. This is the highest miracle of genius; that? things
which are not should be as though they were, that? /the
imaginations of one mind should become the personal
recollections of another.

5. And this miracle the tinker has wrought. There is

no ascent, no declivity, no resting—place, no turnstile,
with which we are not perfectly acquainted. The wicket
gate, and the desolate swamp which separates it from the
City of Destruction; the long line of road, as straight as
rule can make it; the Interpreter’s house, and all its fair
shows; the prisoner in the iron cage; the palace, at the
doors of which armed men kept guard, and on the bat—
tlements of which walked persons clothed all in gold;
the cross and the sepulchre ; the steep hill and the pleas-
ant arbor; the stately front of the House Beautiful by the
Way side; the low green valley of Humiliation, rich with
grass‘ and covered with ﬂocks, all3 are as well known-to
us as the sights of our own street. '

6. Then we come to the narrow place where Apollyon
strode right4 across the whole breadth of the Way, to stop
the journey of Christian, and where afterwards the pillar
was set up to testify how bravely the pilgrim had fought
the good ﬁght. As we advance, the valley becomes deep-
er and deeper. The shade of the precipices on both
sides fallsblacker and blacker. .

'7. The clouds gather overhead. Doleful voices, the
clanking of chains, and the rushing of many feet to and
fro, are heard through the darkness. The Way, hardly
discernible in gloom, runs close by the mouth of the
burning pit, which sends forth its ﬂames, its noisome

with the mangled bodies of those who have perished ly-

slain. \

9. Then the road passes straight on through a waste
moor, till at length1 the towers of’ a distant city appear
before the traveller; and soon he is in the midst of the
innumerable multitudes of Vanity Fair. There are the
jugglers and the apes, the shops and the puppet-shows.
There are Italian Row? and French Row,9 and Spanish
Row, and Britain Row, with their crowdsof buyers, sellers

' paved with the skulls of pilgrims; and right onward are

thesheep-felds and orchards of the Delectable Mountains.

11. From the Delectable Mountains the way lies through
the fogs and briers of the Enchanted Ground, with here
‘and there a bed of’ soft cushions spread under a green
arbor. And beyond, is the land of Beulah, where the
flowers, the grapes, and the songs ‘of birds never cease,
and where the sun shines night and day. Thence are
plainly seen the golden pavements and streets of pearl,

a peculiar character from the daily contemplation of su-
perior beings and eternal interests-. Not content with
acknowledging, in general terms, an overruling Provi-
dence, they habitually ascribed every event to the Will of
the Great Being, for Whose power nothing Was too vast,
for Whose inspection nothing Was too minute. To knovvl
him, to serve1 him, to enjoy him,1 was With them the
great end of existence.

2. They rejected with contempt the ceremonious hom-
age which other sects substituted for the pure vvorship
of the soul. Instead of catching occasional glimpses of
the Deity through an obsctuing veil, they aspired to gaze
full on the intolerable brightness, and to commune with
him face to face. Hence originated their contempt for
terrestrial distinctions. - T

eloquent in a more sublime language; noblesl by the right

CHAPTER XIII.

RELICS.—--[IRVING.]

1. My ﬁrst visit was to the house where Shakspeare

,Was born, and Where, according to tradition, he was

brought up to his father’s craft of - Wool-combing. It is a
small mean-looking ediﬁce of Wood and plaster, a true
nestling-place of genius, which seems to delight in
hatching its offspring in by-corners.

2. The Walls of its squalid‘ chambers are covered with

I names and inscriptions in every language, by pilgrims of

all nations, ranks, and conditions, from the prince to the
peasant; and present a simple, but striking instance of
the spontaneous and universal homage of mankind to
the great poet of nature.

3. The house is shown by a garrulous old lady, in a
frosty red face, lighted up by a cold,1 blue,1 anxiousl eye,
and garnished with artiﬁcial locks of ﬂaxen hair, curling
from under an exceedingly dirty cap. She was peculiarly
assiduous in exhibiting the relics with which this, like all
other celebrated shrines, abounds. \

cross; of’ which there is enough extant to build a ship

6. The most favorite object _of curiosity, however, is
Shakspeare’s chair. It stands the chimney-nook of a
small gloomy chamber, just1 behind what was his father’s
shop. Here he may, many a time have sat when a boy,
watching the slowly revolving spit with all the longing

-of an urchin; or of an evening? listening to the cronies

and gossips of Stratford, dealing forth church—yard tales
and legendary anecdotes of the troublesome times of

such was the fervent zeal of devotees, that the chair had
to be new-bottomed at least once in three years.

8. It is worthy of notice also, in the history of this
extraordinary chair, that it partakes something of the
volatile nature of the Santa Casa of Loretto,or the flying

HOW PAIN CAN BE A CAUSE or DELIGHT.-[BURKE]

1. Providence has so ordered it, that a state of rest and
inaction, however it may ﬂatter our indolence, should be

‘productive of many inconveniences; that it should gen-

erate such disorders, as may force us to have recourse to
some labor, as a thing absolutely ‘requisite to make us
pass our lives with tolerable satisfaction; for the nature
of ‘rest is to suffer all the parts of our bodies to fall into
a relaxation, that not only disables the members from

I perf'o‘rming their functions, but takes away the vigorous

tone of ﬁbre which is requisite for carrying on the natu-
ral and necessary secretions.’* ‘ ‘
" 2. At the same time, that,’r in this languid inactive state,
the nerves are more liable to the -most horrid convulsions,
than When they are suﬁiciently braced and strengthened.
Melancholy, dejection, and despair, and often self-mur-
der, is the ‘consequence of the gloomy View We take of

' things in this relaxed state of the body.

3. The best remedy forall these evils is exercise or
labor; ‘ and labor is a surmountingl of diﬂiculties, an
exertion of the contracting power of the muscles; and
as such, resembles pain, which consists in tension or
contraction, in every thing but degree. ‘

4. Labor is not only requisite to preserve the coarser

necessary to these ﬁner and more delicate organs, on’

5. NoW,l.as a due exercise is essential to the coarﬂ
muscular parts of the constitution, and that without this

FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE.
Language, especially in poetry, is often employed

A ﬁguratively. See Gram. under Figures of Syntax}

The ﬁgures most frequently occurring are
1. The METAPHOR-—a comparison involved in a single word 3 as
““ The lively diamond drinks thy purest rays.”

In this line the Word clmnks is used under the ﬁgure of a meta-

. pphorg there is a comparison implied associating the diamond, in the

thoughts of the reader,with some animated being, and imparting to
the whole line, interest and beauty. This ﬁgure occurs very fre-
quently in both prose and poetry.

9. A SIMILE--an express and formal comparison; as

Like leaning masts of stranded ships, appear
The pines that near the coast their summits ‘rear.’-

The pines are compared to leaning masts. '

3. PERSONIFI-CATI.0N—0r the ﬁgure by which life and action are
attributed to inanimate things; as,

Come gentle Spring! ethereal Mildness! come,
And ﬁ'om the bosom of your dropping cloud,
Whilei music wakes around, veiled in a shower
Of shadowing roses, on our plains descend.

Life and action are attributed to Spring in these lines.

REMARKS.»

1. Poetry owes much of’ its effect and beauty to the ﬁgurative
Ianguage with which it abounds. The imagination of the poet “
invests inanimate objects with life and intelligence, and represents
them under all the varied aspects, changes and passions, which dis-
tinguish the higher order of' beings.

Combinations of words frequently connect sentences such; as, in

as much as, as well as, in order that, with the intent that, &.c., or any

expression which seems merely to show the relation between the

RULES OF SYNTAX.

THE NOUN AND PRONOUN.

NOTE.—It may be understood that the word noan will be used" as
including both the noun and the pronoun. «

RULE I.

A noun joined to another noun, and denoting the same
person or thing, is put in the same case; as, Cicero, the
orator.

NOTE.--This construction is called apposition.

REMARKS.

1. A noun is sometimes in apposition with a clause ; as, The eld-
est son was always brought up to that employment, (1 custom which
he and my father followed.

2. A clause, or  verb in the Inﬁnitive mode is sometimes in ap-
position with a noun preceding it 3 as, I would, only mention at
present one article, that of maintenance of the clergy.

3. A noun in apposition isTrequently connected to the one which
is explained, by the conjunction-as ; as, My father intended to de-
vote me as the tythe of his sons. ’

No'rE.—The word as, appears to be used frequently in the sense
of the Latin preposition pro, instead of, in place of, for, in the ca-
pacity of.- _

4». Names or titles employed to distinguish individuals of a family
or class, are by some parsed as nouns in apposition 3 as, George
Washington, Mr. Thompson, Dr. West, Col. Hardy; by some they
are called adjectives; by others the general name, with the speciﬁc
appellation or titles, is called a complex noun.

My exaltation, and my whole delight,

That thou in me, Well pleas’d, declar’st thy will
Fulﬁll’d, which to fulﬁl is all my bliss.

Sceptre and power, thy giving, I assume,

And gladlier shall resign, when in the end

I Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee

For ever, and in me all whom thou 1ov’st:

But whom thou hatest I hate, and can put on

Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,

Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
Arm’d with thy might, rid heaven of these rebell’d
To their prepar’d ill mansion driven down,

To chains of darkness, and th’ undying worm,
That from thy just obedience could revolt,

Whom to obey is happiness entire. ‘

Then shall thy saints unmix’d, and from th’ impure
Far separate, circling thy holy mount,

Unfeigned hallelujahs to thee sing,

By four cherubic shapes; four faces each 10

Of beryl, and careering ﬁres between;

Over their heads a crystal ﬁrmament

Whereon a sapphire throne inlaid with pure [5

Sat eagle-wing’d; ‘beside him hung his bow 20
And quiver with three-bolted thunder stor’d,

And from about him ﬁerce effusion ro1l’d

Of smoke and bickering ﬂames and sparkles dire:
Attended with ten thousand thousand saints

He onward came, far oﬁ' his coming shone; , 25
And twenty thousand (I their number heard) ‘

Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen :

He on the wings of cherub rode sublime

On the crystalline sky, in sapphire thron’d,

Illustrious far and wide, but by his own 30

“ ‘Stand still in bright array, ye saints! here stand,

Ye angels arm’d, this day from battle rest;

Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;

And as ye have receiv’d, so have ye done
