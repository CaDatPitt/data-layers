to insure these desirable objects; and it is believed that
such measures are taken, as will render all the future im-
pressions of this work, uniform in the pages, well exe-
cuted, and perfectly correct.

In (at: progress of society and improvement, some
gradual changes must be expected in a living language;
zmtl corresponding alterations lI'l elementary books of in-
struction, become indispensable: but it is desirable that
these alterations should be as few as possible, for they oe-
casion Lmcertainty and inconvenience. And although
perfect uniformity in speaking, is not probably attain-
able in any living-language, yet it is to be wished,that the
youth of our country may be, as little as possible, per-
plexed with various differing systems and standards.
'1Vh...tever may be the difference of opinion, among in-
:llVldl.lalS, respecting a few particular words, or the parti-
cular arrangement of a few classes of words, the general
interest of education requires, that a disposition to multi-
ply books and systems for teaching the language of the
country, should not be indulged to an unlimited extent.
On this dispositi-on however, the public sentiment alone
can impose restraint Q‘

As the first part of the Institute met with the general
approbation of my fellow citizens, it is presumed the la-
bor bestowed upon this work, in correcting and im-
proving the system, will render it still more acceptable
to the public, Ly facilitating the education of youth, and
enabling teachers to instil into their minds, with the first
rudiments of the language, some just ideas of religion,
morals and domestic economy.

A good-natured Spaniel overtook a surly lVIas-
tiif, as he was travelling upon the high road. Tray,
although an entire stranger to Tiger, very civilly
accosted him; and if it would be no interruption,
he said, he should be glad to hear him company
on his way. Tiger, who happened not to be alto-
gether.--in so growling amoodi as usual, accepted
the proposal ; and they very amicably pursued
their journey together. In the midst of their con-
versation, they arrived at the next village, where
Tiger began to display his malignant disposition,
by an unprovoked attack upon every dog he met.
The villager-s immediately sallieal forth with great
indignation, to rescue their respective'favorites ;
and falling upon our two friends ~Witl“._Out distinc-

TABLE XLI.

7/1: Boy that went to the Wood to look for Birds’
Nests, when he should have gone to School.

WHEN Jack got up, and put on his clothes,
he thought if he could get to the wood he should
be quite well; for he thought more of a_birc_l’s
nest than his book, that would make him wise and
great. When he came there, he could-ﬁnd no
nest, but one that was on the top of a tree, and
with much ado he got up to it, and robbed it of
the eggs.-—Then he tried to get down ; but a branch
of th_e tree found a hole in the skirt of his coat,
and held him fast. At this time he would have‘
been glad to be at school; for the bird in a raget~
at the loss of her eggs-, ﬂew at him, and was like
to pick out his eyes. Now it was that the sight
of a man at the foot of a tree, gave him more joy
than all the nests in the world. This man was so
kind as to chase away the bird, and help him
down from the tree; and from that time forth he
would "not loiter from school; but grew a good
boy and a wise young man; and had the praise and
good will of all that knew him.

OBSERVATIONS.

The cheerful man hears the lark in the morning; the
pensive"man hears the nightingale in the evening.

He who desires no virtue in a companion, has no vir-
tue himself; and that state is hastening to min, in which
no difference is made between good and bad men.

ANALYSIS or SOUNDS
IN TH! '
EJVGLISH'L./YJVGU./IGE. I
____........_...

LANGUAGE, in its more limited sense, is the ex-
pression of ideas by articulate sounds. In a more gene-
ral sense, the Word denotes all sounds by which animals
express their feelings, in such a manner as to be under-
stood by their own species.

Articulate SOLE-‘.CiS are those which are formed by the
human voice, in pronouncing letters, syllables and words,
and constitute the sfzoken language, which is addressed to
the ear. Letters are the marks of sounds, and the first ele-
ments of written language ,which is presented to the eye.

In a perfect language, every simple sound would be ex-
pressed by a distinct ‘rharactex-; and no character would
have more than one sound. But languages are not thus
perfect; and the English Language, in particular, is, in
these respects, extremely irregular.

The letters used in writing, when arranged in a certain
customary order, compose what is called an .«1[fz/zabct.

The English Alphabet consists of twenty six letters, or
single characters ; and for want of others, certain simple
sounds are represented by two letters united.

The letters or single chaiacters are, a, b, c, d, e, f,
g, 'h, 1, j, k, 1, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z,
The compound characters representing distinct sounds
are, ch, sh, th. There is also a distinct sound expressed
by ng, as in long; and another by .9 or 2, as in jizszon, az-
ure, which sound might be represented by 2/2.

Letters are of two kinds, vewc/3 and consonants.

A vowel is a simple articulate sound, formed without
the help of anotherletter, by opening the mouth in apar.
ticular manner, and begun a.nd completed with tl r: same
position of the organs; as, rz, e, o. The letters which re.
present ‘hese sounds are six; a‘, c, z', c, u, y. Buﬂeach of
these characters is used to express two or more sounds.

OBSERVATIONS.
Seek a virtuous man tor your friend, for a vicious man
can neither love long, nor be long beloved--The friend-
ships of the wicked are conspsracies against morality and
social happiness.
More persons seek‘. o lwe long,wthough*long life is not
m thcir power; than to liven. well, though a ‘good life dea
pends on their own will.

USEFUL LESSONS.

JOHN can tell how many square rods of ground make
an acre. Let me hear him. Three feet make a ya-id;
ﬁve yards and a half make a rod or pef"ch ; forty square
rods make a mad or one quarter of an acre, and one
hundred and sixty square rods make anacre. One team
will plow‘ an acre in a day-—sometimes more.

In solids, forty feet of round timber, or ﬁfty feet of
hewn timber, make a ton. A cord of wood contains one
hundred and twenty eight solid feet ; that is, a pile four
eet high, fou? feet wide, and eight feet long.

In cloth measure, two inches and a fifth make a nail
--four nails, one quarter of a yard-thirty six inches, or
three feet make a yard—three quarters of a yard make
an ell Flemish--and ﬁve quarters, make an English ell.

‘ Let us examine the weights used in our own country.
How are heavy goods weighed? By avordupoise weight
--in which sixteen drams make an ounce—-sixteen oun-
ces, ‘one pound—--twenty eight pounds, one quarter of a
hundred--four quarters, or one hundred and twelve pounds
make a hundred—and twenty hundreds, one ton.

By this weight, are sold hay, sugar,' coﬁee, and all
heavy goods and metals, except gold and silver.

What is troy weight ? It is that by whichis estima-
ted the quantity of gold and silver, jewelry, and the
drugs sold by the druggist and” apotnecary. In troy
weight, twenty four grains make a penny weight.
twenty penny weights, one ounce-—and twelve ounces, one
pound. These are the divisions used by the Silversmith
and jeweller. But the apothecary uses a different divisi-
on, and in his ‘weight, twenty grains make a scruple_..
three scrupl-es one dram--eight drams, one ounce-..
and, twelve ounces, one pound.

- The dollar is one hundred cents; but the value of a‘

pound, shilling and penny, is different, in different States,
and in England. English money is called Sterling...
One dollar is four shillings and six pence sterling-—in.,\,f*ew
England and Virginia, it is six shillings—in New York
and North Carolina, it is eight shillings-——-in New Jcrsgy
Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland, it is seven shilliu

and six pence—in South Carolina and Georgia, it is four
shillings and eight pence. But ’ these differences givc
great trouble, and will soon be laid aside as useless,——all
money will bereckcned in dollars and cents.

OBSERVATIONS AND MAXIMS.

THE path of duty. is always the path of safety.

Be very cautious in believing ill of your neighbor;
but more cautious in reporting it. ‘

It requi"es but little discernment to discover the im-
pt" fections of others ; but much humility to acknowledge
our own.

Many evils incident to human life are unavoidable;
but no man is vicious, except by hispown choice;

Avoid vicious company, where the good are often
made bad, and the bad worse. If the good ever associ-
ate with evil men, it should be for the same reason as a
physician visits the sick,—-not to catch the disease, but to

cure it. 5

Some people are lost for want of good advice ; but

more, for want 01 giving heed to it.

3_   An Easy Standard of Pronuncz'atz'ar:.

The following are the vowel sounds in the English
Language—-of a, as in late, ask, ballg hat, what.
of e, in mete, met. '
of 2', in ﬁnd, pit.
of o, in note, not, move.
of u, in truth, but, bush.
of y, in chyle, pity.
The vowels have a long and a short sound, or quanti-
ty; and the different quantities are represented by dif-
fcrent letters. Thus.

f . when shortened
a, in late,

3 . ‘
is expressed . } by 6’ abm let‘

3 es, in feet, by 2', in fit, 3: y in pity.
N 00, in pool, byuin pull 8:00 in wool
ga, in hall, by 0 in holly and a in
wallow.

That the sounds of a in late and 0 in let are only a mo-
diﬁcation of the same vowel, may be easily understood by
attcndingtn the manner of forming the sounds ; for in
both words, the aperture of the mouth and the conﬁgu-
ration of the organs are the same. This circumstance
proves the sameness of the sound or vowel, in the two
words, though dit’l'ering in time or quantity

A consonant is a letter whicl has no sound, or an im-
perfect one, without the help of a vowel. The conso-
nants which are entirely silent, interrupt the goice by
closing the organs; as b, d, g hard, 1;, p, t, which are
called mutcs; as in eh, ed, eg, ek, ep, et.

The consonants which do not entirely interrupt all
sound by closing the organs. are R l, m. n. r, s, v, z,
which are called half vowels or semi-vowels.—'-To these
may be added the sounds of sh, th, zh, and rig, in esh,
eth. ezh, ing. which our language has no single‘ char-
acte rs to express.

A dipthon-2: is the union of two simple sounds uttered
in one breath or aiticulation. The two sounds do not
strictly fol‘!!! ore ; for there are twodiﬂerent positions of
tie.-. organs, and two distinct sounds; but the transition
from one to the Oti‘.t.‘1‘ IS so rapid, .hat the -:TllStlnC1i()I'1 is
scarcely perceived. and the sound is therefore considered
as compound. Dipthoxigal sounds are sometimes re-

Ph have the sound of ./5 as in Philosophy ; except in
Stephen, where the sound is that of v.

Ng have a nasal sound. as in sing ; but when e follows
3, the latter takes the sound of j, as in range. In the
words, longer, stronger, younger, the sound of the g is
doubled, and the last syllable is sounded as if written
long-ger, 8:0.

Sh has one sound only, as in shell ; but its use is often
supplied by ti, vi, and cc, before a vowel, as in motion gra-
ci-ous, cetaceous.

Th has two sounds, aspirate and vocal-—aspirate, as in
think, 'oath—vocal, as in thpse, that, bathe.

50 before a, 0, u and r,. are pronounced like sk, as in
scale, scoff. sculpture, scribble : before :9, z’, y, like soﬁ
c, or 8, as in scene, sceptic, science, scythian. Thus pro-
nonnced,

sca, soe, sci, soc, scu, scy.
ska, se, si, sko, sku, sy.

Formation of Words and Sentences.

Letters form syllables; syllables form words, and words
form sentences, which compose a discourse.

A syllable is a letter or a union of letters, which can
be uttered atone impulse of voice.

A word of one syllable is called a monosyllableg

of two syllables a dissyllable.
of three syllables a trissyllable.
of many syllables a polysyllable.

Of Accmi, limfdzasza and Cadence.

Accent is a forcible stress or Impulse of voice on a letter
or syllable, disting-uisliing it from others in the same
word. When it falls on a vowel, it prolongs the sound,
as in glory ; when it falls on a consonant, the preceding
vowel is short.,as in habit.

The general rule by which accent is regulated. is, that
the stress 0’ voice falls on that syllable of a word, which
renders the articulation most easy to the speaker, and

interogation point (?) shows when a question is asked; as,
What do you see? An exclamation point (1) is a mark of
wonder or surprize; as, O the folly g sz'm2ers .’—-The
pause of these two points is the same as a colon or a pe-
riod, and the sentence should usually be closed with a
raised tone of voice.

( ) A parenthesis includes a part of a sentence, which
is not necessary to make sense, and should be read
quicker, and in a weaker tone of voice.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY:
on,
The History q/‘ Tnzzzprr and UN7'51e1F=rr.

THERE is a great difference, among men, in their
ability to gain propert '; but a still greater difference
in their power of using it to advantage. Two men may
at. quire the same amount of money, in a given time;
yet one will prove to be a poor man, while the other be-
comes rich. A chief and essential difference in the ma-
nagement of property, is, that one man spends only the
:ér2tcres-If of his money, while another spends the j2rz'7z-
C‘./Zfll. V '5 .
I know a farmer by the name ofTHR1zr-ry, who ma.
nages his affairs in this manner: He rises early in the
morning,looks to the condition of his house, barn, horne-
lot and stock——-sees that his cattle, horses and hogs are
fed; examines the tools to see whether they are all in
good order for the \‘y‘oi‘kmen—-takes care that breakﬁist
is ready in due season, and begins work in the cool oi
the day——'W'hen in the field, he keeps steadily at worit,

dy--nor does he stop to tell or hear long stories.--When
the labor of the day is past, he takes refreshment, and
goes to rest at an early hou.r—-In this manner he earns
and gains money.

VVhen T/zrg’/zy has acquired a little property, he does
not spend it or let it slip from him, without use or bene-
ﬁt. He pays his taxes and debts when due or called for,
so that he has no officers fees to pay, nor expences of
courts. He does not frequent the tavern and drink up
all his earnings in liquor that does him no good. He
puts his money to use, that is, he buys more land, or
stock, or lends his money at interest-in short, he makes
his money produce some profit or income. These sav-
ings and proﬁts, though small by themselves, amount in
2. year to a considerable sum, and in a few years, they
swell to an estate—'l‘hri_fty becomes a wealthy farmer,
with several hundred acres of land, and a hundred head
of cattle. .

Very different is the management of UNTHRIFTV
He lies in bed, till a late hour, in the morning—-then ri-
ses, and goes to the bottle for a dram, or to the tavern
for a glass of bitters—Thus he spends six cents before
breakfast, for a dram that makes him dull and heavy all
day. He gets his breakfast late, when he ought to be at
work——Wl.en he supposes he is ready to begin the work
of the day, he ﬁnds he has not the necessary tools, or
some of them are out of order,--‘he plow-share 1S to be
sent half a mile to a blacksmith to be mended ; a tooth
or two in a rake or the handle of a hoe, is broke; or a
sythe or an ax is to be ground--Now, he is in a great
hurry , he bustles about to make preparation for work--
and what is done in a hurry is ill done—he loses a part
of the day in getting ready--and perhaps the time of his
workmen. At ten or eleven o'clock, he is ready to go to
work-—then comes a boy and tells him, the sheep have
escaped from the pasture—-or the cows have got among
his corn——or tne hogs into the garden—He frets and
s"<mns and runs to drive them out-—a half hour or more
tune is lost in driving the cattle from mischief, and re-
pairin~_.-; a poor broken fence——-a fence that answers no
purpose but to lull him into security, and teach his hor-
scs and cattle to be unruly.-—After all this bustle, the fa-

tigue of which is worse than common labor, Untbrjfty is
ready to begin a day’s work at twelve o’clock.-—-Thus
half his time is lost in supplying defects, which proceed
rom want of foresight and good management, His small
crops are damaged or destroyed by unruly cattle.--His
barn is open and leaky, and what little he §.;;1tii.eI‘S, is in-
jured by the rain and snow.--His house is in a like Con-

dition--the shingles and clapboards fall oil’ and let in the.

water, which causes the timber, noors and furniture to
decay-—-and exposed to inclemencies of weather, laiswife
and children fall s.ick——--their time is lost, and the mis~
chief closes with a ruinous train of expenses for medi-
cines and physicians.-—Aft'er dragging out some years
of disappointment, misery and poverty, the lawyer and
the sheriff sweep away the scanty remains of his estate.
This is the history of UNTHRIF'rY——his principal is
spent-he has no interest.

Not unlike this, is the history of the Grog-drinker.
This man wonders why he does not thrive in the world ;
he cannot see the reason why his neighbor 3(‘enz/2r..-rarzcc
should he more prosperous than himself——hut in truth,
he makes no calculations. Ten cents a day fo -  , is
a small sum, he thinks, which can hurt no a-,....-ma! But
let us make an estimate-—-arithmetic is very iisefttl for a
man who ventures to spend small sums cV't'\‘}' day " en
cents a day amount in a year to thirty-six dollars and a
half—a sum sullicient to buy a good. faim-horse I {his
surely is no small sum for a farmer or mechanic-—B'ut in
ten years, this sum amounts to three liund"ed and sixty
ﬁve dollars, besides interest in the mean time! W’ hat an
amount is this for drains and hitters in ten years! it is
money enough to build a small house 3 But look at the
amount in theirty years l--—0ne thousand and ninety five

But, says the laboring man, “ I cannot work “’llh°‘}f

Then drink something that will give durable nourisllfnfnt
--Of all the substances taken into the stomach, sP”'1tu'

Wholly destitute of it-but distilled spirituous liquors con’
tain little or none.

But says the laborer or the traveller, “ spirituous li-
quors warm the stomach and are very useful in cold
Weather”—-—.l\}o, this is not correct. Spirits enliven the
feelings for half an hour-—-but leave the body more dull
languid and cold than it was before. A man will freeze
the sooner for drinking spirits of any kind. If a man
wishes to guard a:;jainst cold, let him eat a biscuit, a bit
of bread or a meal of victuals. Four ounces of bread will
give a more dui able warmth to the body, than a gallon of
spirits—-food is the natural stimulant or exciting power of
the human body—it gives warmth and strength, and does
not leave the body,as spirit does, more feeble and languid.
....The practice of dritnking spirits gives a man sed eyes,
a bloated face, and an empty purse.-—~Itin_iures the liver,
produces tlrnpsy, occasions a trembling of the joints and
limbs, and closes life with slow decay or palsy.-—Th'-is is
a short history of the drinker of distilled spirits. If a few
drinking men are found to be exceptions to this account,
still the remarks are true, as they apply to most cases.
Spirituous liquors shorten more lives than famine, pesti-
lence and the sword!

LESSONS on FAMILIAR SUBJECTS.

ALL mankind live on the fruits of the earth-the first
and most necessary employment therefore is the tillage
of the ground, called agriculture, husbandry, or farm-
ing. The farmer clears his land of trees, roots and
stones—he surrounds it with a fence of poles, posts and

~rails, stonev-wall, hedge or ditch." He plows and harrows or
drags the soil, to break the clods or turf, and make it mel-
low and pliable--he manures it also, if necessary, with

.-in 4E(l~s.Z/I ._‘.~'t.'ui<fa:'.r.r’ of 1’7'01i-zuztiuti 012. 153

stable dung, ashes, marl, plaster, lime, sea-shells, or de-
cayed vegetable substances. He plants maiz in rows, or
sows wheat, barley, rye, oats, buckwhea-t, ﬂax or hemp.
He hoes the maiz, two or three times, kills the weeds
and draws the earth round the hills to support and nour-
ish the plants.--VVhen the gra—in.is ripe, he reaps or cra-
dles his grain, and pulls the ﬂax.-—The cars of maiz
are picked by hand, or the stalks cut with a sic-
ltle or knife, and the husks are stripped off, in the eve-
ning. VVith what joy does the farmer gather his crops,
of the former and latter harvest 2--He toils indeed, but he
reaps the fruit of his labor in peace-—he ﬁlls his granary
in summer, and in autumn presents a thank-offering to
God for his bounty.

See the mower, how he swings his sythe !--The
grass falls prostrate before him-—the glory of the
field 15 laid low—-the land isstripped of its verdant cov-
ering. See the stripling follow his father or brother, and
with a pitch fork, spread the thick swath, and shake the
grass about the meadow! How fragrant the smell of
new-made hay--how delightful the task to tend it!

Enter the fo:‘:st of the wilderness-—See here and there
a rustic dwelling made of logs-—a little spot cleared and
:ultivated——a thatched hovel to shelter a cow and her
food-—the forest resoimding with the ax-man's blows, as
heeievels the sturdybeacli, maple, or hemlock ; while the
crackling ﬁre aids his hands, by consuming the massy
piles of wood which he cannot remove—--Hearthe howl-
ing wolf, or watch the nimble deer, as he bounds along
among the trees.—The faithful cow, in search of shrubs
and twigs, strays from the cottage, and the owner seeks
her at evening, in the gloomy forest ; led by the tinkling
of the bell, he ﬁnds and drives her home. A bowl of bread
and milk, furnishes him with his frugal repast ; he re-
tires weary to rest—-and the sleep of the laboring man is
sweet.

See the dairy woman, while she ﬁlls her pails with
new milk—the gentle cows quietly chewing their cuds
by her side. Enter the mill:-room, see the pans, pails
and tubs, how clean and sweet, all in order, and fit for

most agreeable to the he.arer——By this rule has the ac-
cent of most words been imperceptibly established by
lung and universal consent.

\\'ht-n ii word consists of three or more syllables,
the ease of speaking requires usually a secondary ac-
Cell?» of less forcible utterance than the primary. but
clearly distinguishable‘from the pronunciation of unac-
cented syllables; as superﬂuity, literary.

In many compound words, the parts of which are im«
portant words of themselves, there is very little distinc-
tion of accent, as ink-stand, church-yard.

Emphasis, is a particular force of utterance given to
a particular word in a sentence, on account of its impor~
tance.

Cadence is a fall or modulation of the voice in read-
ing or speaking, especially at the end of a sentence.

VVoi-ds are simple or compound, primitive or deriva-
live.

A simple. word cannot be divided, without destroying
the sense ; as man, child, house, charity, faith,

A compound word is formed by two 51‘ more words ; as
chimney-piece, book-binder. 

Primitive words are such as are not derived, but con-
stitute a radical stock fromwhich others are formed; as
grace, hope, charm.

Derivative words are those which are formed of a pri—
mitive, and some termination or additional syllable; as
grace-less. hope-ful, charm-ing, un-welcome.

Spelling is the art or practice of writing or reading the
proper letters of a word; called also orthography. In
forniing tables for learners, the best rule to be observed
is, to divide the syllables in such a manner as to guide the
learner by the sound of the letters, to the sound of the
words ; that is, to divide them as they are divided in a just
pronunciation,

George, let us look into the work-shops among the
mechai-11,,-s. Here is a carpenter, he squares a post or a
beam; he scores or notches it ﬁrst, and then hews it

. with his broad-ax. He bores holes with an auger, and

with the help of a chisel, forms a mortise fora tenon.
He measures with a square or rule, and marks his work
with a compass. Each timber is titted to its place. The
sills support the posts. and these support the beams.
Braces secure the frame of a building from swaying or
leauing.;—--Girders and joists support the ﬂoors ; studs,with
the posts, support the walls, and rafters uphold the roof.

Now comes the joiner with his chest of tools. He
planes the boards, joints the shingles, and covers the
b_uilding-—'\«Vith his saw he cuts boards, with his gimb-
let or -wimble, he makes holes for nails, pins or spikes,-—
with his chisel and gouge, he makes mortises.

Then comes the mason with his trowel—the laths are
nailed to the studs and joists to support the plaster, first
a rough coat of coarse mortar of lime and sand is laid
on, and this is covered with a beautiful white plaster.
Anti last of all crimes the painter with his brush and oil-

OF HUMILITY.

Q. W/zezt is humility .9

A. A lowly temper of mind.

Q. IV/zaz ..:rc Z/t6‘ ad1vantagc.9 of /zumility?

A. The advantages of humiiity in this life are very on-'
merous and great. The humble man has few or no -.~ne-
mies. Everv one loves him and is ready to do hi .11 good.
If he is rich and prosperous, people do not em _v him ; if he
is poor and unfortunate, every one pities him and is dispo-
sed to alleviate his di-stresses.

Q. I'V/zatz'.s*/zride?

A. A lofty higli minded disposition.

Q. Iséﬁridc c immendabie .9

A. By no means. A modest self approving opinion oi
our own good deeds is very right.-—it is natural---it is a-
greeable, and a spur to good actions. But we should no -.
suffer our hearts to be blown up with pride, whatever
great and good deeds we have done; for pride brings upon
us the ill-will of mankind, and displeasure of our maker.

Q. Z/V/zat cﬂect /Jae /zumz'lit_z, u/ion our own minds .9

A. Humility is attended with peace of mind and sell-
satisfaction. The humble man is not disturbed w'it.h ct oss
accidents, and is never fretful an-l uneasy ; nor does he
repine when others grow rich. lle is contented, gccause

his mind is at ease.

OF MERCY.

‘Q. W-ha‘! is mercy .? ~

A. It is tenderness of heart.

Q. I/Vlzat are the achvantagcs Q)‘ this -virtue .1’

A. The exercise of it tends to diﬁ‘use happiness and
lessen the evils of life. Rulers of a merciful temper will
make then-good subjects happy; and will not torment the
éad, with needless severity. Parents and masters will
not abuse their children and servants with harsh treat-
ment. More love, more conﬁdence, more happiness,
will subsist among men, and of course society will be
happier. ‘

Q. S/zozztd not beasts as well as men be treated with
mercy-

A. They ought indeed. It is wrong to give needless
pain even to a beast. Cruelty to the brutes shows a man
has a hard heart, and if a man is unfeeling to a beast, his
will not have much feeling for men. If a man treats his
beast with cruelty, beware oftrusting yourself in his pow-
er. He will probably make a severe master and a cruel
husband.

Q. How does cruelty 3/2o=w its cﬂiacts .9

ses his wife and children. A cruel master acts the ty-
rant over his apprentices and servants. The effects of
cruelty are, hatred, quarrels, mmults and wretchedness.

Q. Is it right ever to be angry .9

A. It is right in certain cases that we should be an»-

rom further insults.

at man is ini\11'e¢':, that he slim:-ld see): a recmnpence.
But a rrscompc-net: is all he can rlemanu, and of that he

Q. M/izaz has C/u'z'.s-I said ‘resjiecting generosity .9

A. He has commanded us to be generous in this pas-
sage, “ \Vhosoever shall compel (or urge) you to gob
mile, go with him two.” .

Q. Are we to fzcrjorm t/zis literally 2

A. The meaning of the command will not aiways re.
-quire this.—But in general we are to dotmore for others
than they ask, provided we can do it, wihout essentially
in_im'ing ourselves. \-Ve ought cheerfully to suffer many
inconveniences to oblige others, ‘.hou;:h we are not re.
quired to do our-selves any essential injury.

Q. Of-w/zat advantage is generosity to me man -who ear-
cicisas it .9

A. It lays others under obligations to the g;-enerous
man ; and the probability is that he wil-i be repaid three
fold. Every man on earth wants favors at some time or
other in his life; and if we will not help others, others
will not help us. I t. is for a man’s interest to be generous.

A. A thamzihlness of heart for favors received.

Q. Is is.‘ a (July to be Z/zrz7z.(fu!ﬁ;r_fa'vr.>‘/8 .9 .

A. It is a duty and a virtue. A man who does not
feel grateful for kind acts done for him by others, does
not deserve favors of any kind. He ought to be shut out
from the society of the good. He is worse than a say»
age. for a sax age never forgets an act of kindness

Q. If"/rat is the e57'cc£ Q/‘true kirzzlness .9

A. It softens the heart towards the generous man,
and every thing which subdues the pride and other un-
social passions of the heart, fits a min to be a better
citizen, a better neighbor, a better husband and a better
friend. A man who is sensible of favors and ready to
acknowledge them, is more inclined to perform kind of-
fices, not only towards his benefactor, but towards all
others.

08 TRUTH.

Q. IV/zat 2'8 trut/2 .?

A. It is speaking and acting agreeably to fact,

Q. Is it a duty to sfzeak trut/z at all times .9

A. If we speak at all, we should tell the truth. It is‘
not always necessary to tell what we know. There are
many things which concern ourselves and others, which
we had better not publish to the world.

Q. IV/‘mt rules are More res/zecting the /zublis/ring of
from .9 ,

A. 1. W’ hen we are called upon to testify in courts,
we should speak the whole truth and that without dis-
guise. ‘F0 leave out small circumstances, or to give a
coloring to others, with a View to favor one side more
than the other, is to the highest degree criminal.

12*‘. ‘When we know something of our neighbor which

isagainst his character, we§may not publish it, unless
to prevent his doing‘ an injury to another person.

3. XV hen we sell any thing to another, We ought not
to representnthe article to be better than it really is. If
there are faults in it which may easily be seen, the law
of man does not require us to inform the buyer of these
faults,be(,ause he may see them himself. But it is not
honorable nor generous, nor strictly honest to conceal
even apparent faults. But when faults are out of sight,
the seller ought to tell the buyer of them. If he does
not, he is a cheat and a doxvnri-ght knave.

Q. I/V/tat are the ill tjﬂiects of lying and deceiving .9

A. The man who lies, deceivcs or cheats, loses his re=-
putation. No person will believe him, even when he
speaks the truth ; he is shunned as a pest to society.

Falsehood and cheating destroy all conﬁdence between
man and man ; they raise jealousies and suspicions a-
mong men ; they thus weaken the bands of society and
destroy chappinqxs. Besides, cheating often strips people
‘of their property and makes them poor and wretched.

Or CHARITY AND GIVING ALMS.

Q. PVhat is tharity .7

A. It signiﬁes giving to the poor, or it is a favorable
opinion of men and their actions.

Q..- 1472372 and how far is it our duty to give to thcﬂoar?

A. When others really want what we can spare with-
out material injury to ourselves, it is our duty to give

them something to relieve their wants.

Q- PV/zen /zersons are reduced to want by their own la.
zincss and vices, by drunkenness, gambling and the like, is
it a duty to relieve them .3’ '

A__. In general, it is not. The man who gives money
and provisions to a lazy, vicious man, becomes a par.
taker of his guilt. Perhaps it- may be right, to give
such a man a meal of victuals to keep him from starv.
ing, and it is certainly right t6‘ feed his wife and famjgy
and make them comfortable. ’

Q. Who are the fzro/zcr objects qf chari:

164- An Easy Standard of Pronunciation.

A. Persons who are reduced towant by sickness, no.
avoidable losses by ﬁre, storms at sea or land, drouth or
accidents of other kinds. To such persons we are com-
manded to give; and it is our own interest to be chari-
table ; for We are all liable to misfortunes and may want

:charit}.=-' ourselves.

Q. In w/zat manner should we btstowjizvors .1’

A. We should do it with gentleness and affection;
ptltting on no airs of pride and arrogance. ‘.Ve should
also take no pains to publish our charities, but lather
to conceal them ; for if we boast of our generosity, we
discover that we give from mean selﬁsh motives. Christ
commands us, in giving aims, not to ie our left hand
know what our right hand doeth.

Q. How can c/zarity be e.rercz'sca’ in our qniraans of
others .9

A. By thinking favorably of them and their actions
Every man has his faults; but charity will not put a
harsh construction on another’s conduct. It will not
charge his conduct to bad views and motives, unless this
appears very clear indeed.

OF AVARICE.

Q. Wkaz is a‘varz‘re .9
A. An excessive desire o possessing wealth.
Q. Is t/zia commendable .5’
A. It is not; but one of the meanest of vices.
Q. Can an (.-varicious man be an honest man .9
A. It is hardly possible; for the lust of gain is almost
always accompanied with a disposition to take ..mean and
undue advantages of others.
Q. M"/zat cjﬂ?-‘Cl /zas avarice u/zan the lzea-rt .9
A. It contracts the heart—-narrows the sphere of be-
nevolence--blunts ail the ﬁne feelings of sensibility, and
sours the mind towards society. An avaricious man, a
miser, a niggard, is wrapped up in selfishness, like some
worms, which crawl about and eat for some time to fill
fzeinselves, then wind themselves up in separate cover.
rigs and die.

An Easy Standard of Pronunciation. 165

Q If/'Izat imury is done by avarice to society.

A. Avarice gathers together more property,than the
owner wants, and keeps .thoarded up,where it does no
good. The poor are thus deprived of some business,
some means of support; the pioperty gains nothing tq
the community ; and somebody is less happy by means
of this hoarding of wealth.

Q. In -what /zrofzortian docs avarice do-hurt .9

A. In an exact» proportion to its power of doing good.
The miser’s heart grows less, in proportion as his estate
grows larger. The more money he has-, the more he
has people in his power, and the more he grinds the
face of the poor. The larger the tree and the more
spreading the branches, the more small plants are sha-
ded and robbed of their nourishment.

OF FRUGALITY AND ECONOMY.

Q. W7zat is the distinction bet-ween frugality and ava-
rice .?

A. Frugality is a prudent saving of property from
needless waste. Avarice gathers more and spends less
than is necessary

Q. I/V/zat is economy .9

A. It is frugality in expenses-—it is a prudent man-
agement of one’s estate. It disposes of property for
useful purposes without waste

Q. h’o<:u far does true economy extend .9

A. To the saving of every thing which it is not ne-
cessary to sjaencl for comfort and convenience ; and the
keeping om.-’s expenses. within his income or earnings.

Q. IV/zaz is ‘wast«:fiu'rz¢.'s.s .3

A. It is the spentlinsa; of money for what is not want-
ed. If a nun drinks a dram which is not necessary for
him, or buys a cane which he-"does not want. he wastes
his money. He injures lzimself; as much as if he had
thrown away his money.

Q. Is not waste often occasioned by mere negligence .?

A. Very often. The man who does not keep his
house and ban; well covered; who does not keep good
fences about his ﬁelds; who suffers his farming utem

OF INDUSTRY.

Q. I/V/lat z's,i71du.s-try .9

A. It is a clilizg-exit attezitioii to business in our several
occupations.

Q. Is labor a curse 0/7‘ a blessing ?

A. Hard labor or drudgery is often a curse, by mak-
ing life toilsome and painful. But constant moderate
labor is the greatest of blessings.

Q. I/V/zy then do /zeo/zle com/ilaivz c_>fz't.?

A. Because they do not know the evils of not laboring.
Labor keeps the body in health and makes men relish
all their enjoyments. “ The sleep of the laboring man
is sweet,” so is his food. He walks cheerful and whist-
ling about his ﬁeld or his shnp,and scarcely knows pain.

The rich and indolent first lose their health for want
of action-—They turn pale, their bodies are enfeebled,
they lose their appetite for food and sleep, they yawn
out a tasteless life of dullness, without pleasure, and often
useless to the world.

Q. What are t/zc other good cﬂkcts of industry .9

A. One eﬁ'ect is to procure an estate. Our Creator
has kindly united our duty, our interest and happiness ;
for the same labor which makes us healthy and cheer-
ful, gives us wealth.

Another good effect of industry is, to keep men from
vice. "Not all tlrgr moral discourses ever delivered to

OF CHEERFULNESS.

Q. Is c/zeergfulness a virtue .?

A. It dobtless is, and a moral duty to practice it.

Q, Ca"/2. we be cheerful when we /I/case?

A. In general it depends much‘ on ourselves. Vfe
ean often mold our tempers into :1 cheerful frame.—...
VVe can frequent sonipany and other objects calcula;ed
to inspire us with citeerﬁllness. To indulge an habitual
gloominess of mind 15 weakness andxsin.

Q. W/zat are the efecta 0/‘c/zee7_'/ulness on ourselves?

A. Cheerfulness is a great preservative of health,
over which it is our duty to watch with care. We
have no light to sacrifice our health by the indulge nce
ofa gloomy state of mud. _Besid: s, a cheerful man will
do more business and do it better, than a melancholy
one.

Q. What are the eﬂects of C/zeerjfu/nests on c-t/zers P

A. ChCC1'f\ll.nC‘SS is readily communicated to others,
by which means their happiness is increased-. \‘~.7e are
all inﬂuenced by sympathy, and naturally partake of the
joys and sc-rrows of others.

Q, W/zat eﬂect /uzs melanc/zoly on I/ze /zearz .1’

’ A- It hardens and benucas it.— It chills the warm af-
fc ctions of love and friendship, and prevents the exercise
of the social passions. A melancholy p:rson’s life is all
night and winter. It is as unnatural as perpetual darli-
ness and frost.

or of quieting its pains, is to change the objects that are
about us; to ride from place to place and frequent cheer-
ful company. It is our duty so to do, especially when
grief sits heavy on the heart.

Q. Is it not right to grieve for the loss of our friends 3’

p A. It is certainly right ; but we should endeavor to
moderate our grief, and not suffer it to impair our health,
or to grow into a settled melanchoiyf The. use of grief
is to soften the heart and make us better But when our
friends are dead, we can render them no further service;
Our duty to them ends, when we commit them to the
grave; but our duty to ourselves, our families and sur-
viving friends, requires that we perform to them the
customary otiices of life. We should therefore remember
our departed Friends only to imitate their virtues ; and
not to pine away with useless sorrow.

Q. Has no: religion a tendency to fill the mind -wit}:
gloom?

A. True religion never has this effect. Superstition
and false notions of God, often make men gloomy ; but
true rational piety and religion have the contrary etfect.
They fill the mind with joy and cheertulness; and the
countenance of a truly pious man should always wear a
serene smile.

Q. What has C"m‘.st said concerning gloomy C/zrz'st:'ans?

A. H e has pronounced them hypocrites ; and com-
manded his followcrs not to copy their sad countenances
and disﬁgured faces ; but even in their acts of humilia-
tion to “ anoint their heads and wash their feet.” Christ
intended by this, the-.t religion does not consist in, nor re-
quire a monkish sadness and gravity; on the other hand
he intimates that such a/2/zraranccs of sanctity are gene-
rally the marks of hypocrisy; He expressly enjoins up-
on his followers, marks of cheerliilness. Indeed, the on.
ly true ground of perpetual cheerfulness, is,a conscious-
ness ofever having done well, am‘ an assurance of divine
favor.

0, as in her, bird, come, pronounced lzur, bu-rd, cum; num-
ber. 9, represents the fnst sound of a made by e, as in
tlmr, vein, pronounced tlzare, vane ,- number 10, repre-
Sﬁfits the French sound of 2‘, which is the same as c long.

The sounds of the dipthongs oi and on are not repre-
sented by ﬁgures , these have one invariable sound, and
are placed before the words where they occur in the

ables.

Silent letters are printed in Italic characters. Thus, in
head, goal, build, people, ﬁght, the Italic letters have no
sound. ,

S, when printed in Itaiic, is not silent, but pronounced
like z, as in devise, pronounced devize.

The letter e at the end of words of more syllables than
one, is almost always silent: but serves often to length-
en a foregoing vowel ; as inbid, bide ,- to soften c as in no-
lice“; or to soften g, as in homage ,- or to change the sound
of t/2 izom the first to the second, as in bath, bathe. In
the follow ing work, when a ﬁnal lengthens the foregoing
vowel, that is, gives it its first sound, it is printed in a
Roman character, as in fate ; but in all other cases it is
printed in Italic.  l

C/1 have the English sound. as in chﬁivn ,- except in the
38th and 39th tables, and in proper names.

The sounds of Hz in this and thou,'are all distinguished
in the 12th and 37th tables; except in numeral adjec-
tlves.

';l‘he sound of aw is invariably that of broad a, and that
of cw nearly the same as u long.

N. B. Although one ch-aracterlis sufiicientto express
a simple sound, yet the combinations ee, aw .c‘w, 00, are
so well ’{<.11own to express certain sounds, that it was judg-
ed best to print both letters in Roinap characters. Ck and
as are aiso printed in Roman characters, though one
;il~3,1c Woultl be sufficient to express the sound.

Ho 5 gures are placed over the vowels in unaccem ed 5) llables. becausc
they are short. It rnust be obxerved_. however, that in unac-
cemed tenninating syllables, almost all vowels are pronounced
like :‘ and at short. Thus

al is pronozmccd 11!, rural rurul,
612 it,  ‘ﬁe-Ylt.

This is the general rulcin the language; originating doubtless
from this cause, that shorri and u are ;:rom,~~nced with a less aper-
ture or opening of the mouth, with less exertion of the organs, and
consequently with more ease than the other vowels in these termi-
nating syllables; for in order to pronounce them right, nothing
more is requisite than to lay a proper stress of the voice on the ac-
cented syllable, and pronounce the unaccented sy 1‘:-ables with more
case and rapidity. When any of these "terminations are accented,

as some of them are, the vow el retains its own sound

lament, def/ress, &c.

The ﬁgures are placed overthe vowels of the accented syllables;
and one figure marks all the words that fall

by another fi gm-e.

gj? Having proceeded through tables, composed of easy word;
from one to four syllables, let the learner begin the following tables,
which consist of more diﬁicult words. In these the child will be
much assisted by a know ledge of the figures and the use of the
Ita.i:lCS.

If the instructor should think it useful to let his pupils read some
of the easy lessons, before they have ﬁnished spelling, he may di-
vide their studies-—let them spell one part of the day, and read the
other.

but play with such as tell tales, tell lies, curse,
swear and steal, they will come to ‘some bad
end, and must be whipt till they mend their
ways.

TABLE XV.

LESSON I.

THE time will come when we must all be
laid in the dust.

Keep thy tongue from ill, and thy lips ﬁ'om
giuile. Let thy words be plain and true to the
thoughts of the heart.

He that strives to vex or hurt those that sit
next him, is a bad boy, and will meet with foes
let him go where he will; but he that is kind,
and loves to live in peace, will make friends of
all that know him.

E

59 An Easy Standard qf Pronunciczzzen.

A clown will not make a bow, nor thank you
when you give him what he Wants ; but he that
is well bred, will do both. A
He that speaks loud in school, will not learn
his own book well, nor let the rest learn theirs;
but those that make no noise will soon be wise,
and gain much love and good will.

II

Shun the boy that tells lies, or speaks bad
Words; for he would soon bring thee to shame.

He that does no harm shall gain the love of
the Whole school; but he that strives to hurt
the rest, shall gain their ill will.

He that lies in bed when he should go to
school, is not wise; but he that shakes oil’ sleep
shall have praise. .

He is a fool that does not choose the best
boys when he goes to play; for bad boys will
cheat, and lie, and swear, and strive to make
him as bad as themselves.

Slight no man, for you know not how soon
vou may stand in need of his help.

III.

If you have done wrong, own your fault;
for he tnat tells a lie to hide it, makes it worse.

He that tells the truth is a wise child; but he
that tells lies, will not be heard when he speaks
the truth.

VVhen you are at school, make no noise,
but keep your seat, and mind vour book ; for
what you learn will do yuu good,when you grow
to be a man.

Piav no tricks on them that sit next you; for

An Easy Szamlarrl qf Pronu1zciatz'<m. 51

if you do, good boys will shun you as they would
a dog that they knew would bite them.

He that hurts you at the same time that he
calls you his friend, is worse than a snake in the
grass.

Be kind to all men, and hurt not thyself.

A Wise child loves to learn his book, but the  

fool would choose to play with toys.
IV.
Sloth keeps such a hold of some boys, that
they lie in bed when they should go to school;

but a boy that Wants to be Wise will drive sleep '

far from him.

Love him that loves his book, and speaks.

ood words, and does no harm: For such a
lgriend may do thee good all the days of thy life.
Be kind to all as far as you can ; you know
not how soon you may want their help ; and he
that has the good will ofall that know him, shall
not want a friend in time of need.

If you Want to be good, Wise and strong,
read with care such books as have been made
by wise and good men; think of what you read
in your spare hours ; be brisk at play, but do
not swear; and waste not too much of your
time in bed.

brays; a whale spouts. Birds ﬂy in the air
by the help of wings; snakes crawl on the earth,
without feet ; ﬁshes swim in water, by means of
ﬁns; beasts have feet, with hoofs or claws, to
walk or run on land.

All animals are ﬁtted for certain modes of
iving. The birds which feed on ﬂesh, have
strong claws, to catch and hold small animals,
and a hooked bill to tear the ﬂesh in pieces;
such is the vulture and the hawk. F owls which
feed on insects and grain, have mostly a short
strait bill, like the robin.  Those which live
on ﬁsh, have long legs for wading, or long
bills for seizing and holding their prey, like the
heron and ﬁsh hawk. F owls which delight
chieﬂy to fly in the air, and light and build
nests on the trees, have their toes divided, by
which they cling to the branches and twigs;
those which live in and about water have web-
bed feet, that is, their toes united by a ﬁlm or
skin, so that their feet serve as oars or paddles
for swimming.

See the dog, the cat, the wolf, the lion, the
panther and catamount ; what sharp claws and
pointed teeth they have, to seize little animals,
and tear them in pieces! But see the gentle
cow and ox, and timid fheep-—these useful an-
imals are made for man,—they have no claws,
nor sharp teeth,--they have only blunt teeth in
the under jaw, ﬁtted to crop the grass of the
ﬁeld:——they feed in quiet, and come at the call
of man. Oxen submit to the yoke, and plow
the ﬁeld, or draw the cart;—-—the cow returns

milk, the wholesome food of men ;-——and the
sheep yields her yearly ﬂeece, to furnish us with
warm garments.

Henry, tell me the number of days in a year.
Three hundred and ﬁxty ﬁve.—-How many
weeks in a year? Fifty two.--How many days

_in a week? SeVen.—VVhat are they called?

Sunday, Monday,Tues;xlay§‘yVednc.'-sda , Thurs-
day, Friday, Saturday: Qunday is the Sabbath,
or day of rest, and called the Lord’s day, being
devoted to religious duties.—~How many hours
are there in a day? Twenty four.—-How many
minutes in an hour? Sixty, and sixty seconds
in 3 minute. Time is measured by e=oeks and
watches, dials and glasses. The light of the
sun makes the day, and the shade of the earth
makes the night. The earth is round, and rolls
round from west to east once in twenty four
hours. The day time is for labor, and the
night for sleep and repose. Children should
go to bed early.

Charles, how is the year divided P Into
months and seasons. —How many are the
months? Twelve calendar months, and nearly
thirteen lunar months--—-VV'hat are the names
of the calendar months? January, February,
March, April, May, June, 'Ju‘:y, August, Sep-
tember, October, November, December. Jan-
uary begins the year. and the first day of that
month is called New Year’s day. Then people
express to each other their  wishes, and
little boys and girls expect gifts of little books,
toys and p.lums.——-VVI-rat is the lunar month’?

another, which is about twenty eight days, or
four weeks.

John, What are the seasons? Spring, summer,
autumn or fall, and Winter. The spring is se)
called from the springing or ﬁrst shooting of the
plants: when theyput forth leaves and blossoms,
all nature is decked with bloom, and perfumed.
with fragrant odors. 'i’he spring months are
March, April,and May. The summer months
are June, July and August, when the sun pours
his heating rays on the earth, the trees are clo-
thed with leaves and fruit, and the ground is
covered with herbage. The autumnai months
are &:eptember', October and November; which
are a.‘ so caled fall, from the fall of the leaves.
Now the ffuits are gathered, the verdure of the
plants decays; the leaves of the forest turn red
or yehow, and fall from the trees, and nature
is stripped of her verdant robes. Then comes
dreaiy winter. In December, January and Fe-
bruary, frost binds the earth in chains, and
spreads an icy bridge over rivers and lakes; the
snow ,with her white mantle, cnwraps the earth;
no birds ﬁll the air with the music of their
notes; the beasts stand shivering in the stall :
and I en croud around the ﬁre—side, or Wrap-
ped In wool and fur, prepare to meet the chil-
‘ing blast.

ADVICE.

Prefer solid sense to vain wit; study to be useful ra-
tvher than diverting; commend and respect nothing so
much as true piety and virtue—Let no jest intrude to vio
late good manners; never utter what may offend the
Ehastest ear.

TABLE XX.
Lesson 1.

MY son, hear the counsel of thy father, and
forsake not the law of thy mother.

If sinners entice thee to sin, consent thou not.

Wzalk not in the way with them; refrain thy feet
from their path, for their feet run to evil, and make
haste to shed blood.

II.

Be not wise in thine own eyes; but be humble.

Let truth only proceed from thy mouth.——-De-
spise not the poor, because he is poor, but honor
him who is honest and just. Envy not the rich,
but be content with thy fortune. Follow peace
with all men, and let wisdom direct thy steps.

III.

Happy is the man that ﬁndeth wisdom. She is
of more value than rubies. Length of days is in
her right hand, and in her left hand, riches and
honor. Her ways are pleasant, and all her paths
are peace. Exalt her and she shall promote thee:
She shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost em-
brace her.

I V .

The ways of virtue are pleasant, and lead to
life; but they who hate wisdom, love death. Therea-
fore pursue the paths of virtue and peace, then
safety and glory will be thy reward. All my de=
fight is upon the saints that are in the earth, and
bpefi such as excel in virtue.

THERE are ﬁve states of human life, infancy,
childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. The in-
fant is helpless ; he is nourished with milk-—
when he has teeth, he begins to eat bread, meat,
and fruit, and is very fond of cakes and plums.
The little boy chuses some play thing that will make

loves her doll and learns to dress it. She chuses a
closet for her baby-house, where she sets her doll in
ii little chair, by the side of a table, furnished with
tea-cups as big as a thimble.

As soon as boys are large enough, they run away
from home, grow fond of play, climb trees to rob
birds’ nests, tear their clothes, and when they come
home, theirparents often chastise them.—-O how
the rod makes theirlegs smart. These are naughty
boys, who love play better than their books-—-—cruel
boys, who rob the birds of their eggs,—poor little
birds which do no harm, which ﬁll the air with t'he
sweet melody of their notes, and do much good
by devouring the worms, and other insects, which
destroy the fruits and herbage.

Charles, how many barley corns make an inch?
Three.-—HoW many inches are in a foot? Twelve.

is the distance of the ends of a man’s ﬁngers, when
the arms are extended, which is about six feet.

Henry, tell me the gills in a pint. Four.
Two pints make a quart, four quarts make a gallon.
Barrels are of various sizes ; some contain no
more than twenty seven gallons, some thirty, or
thirty two, others thirty six. A hogshead con-
tains sixty three gallons; but we usually call pun-
cheons by the name of hogsheads, and these hold
a!‘ gut one hundred and ten gallons. A pipe con-
tains two hogsheads, or four barrels, or about one

VVi1liam loves fruit. See him picking strawber-
ries--bring him a basket——let him put the berries in
3 basket—-and carry them to his maninta and sis»
ters. Little boys should be kind and generous—-
they should always carry some fruit home for their
friends. Observe the cherry trees-—see, how they
begin to re-dden--in a few days, the cherries will be
ripe, the honey-hearts, the black-hearts, and ox-
hearts, how sweet they are. You must not eat too
many, and make yourself sick. Fill your basket
with cherries and give them to your little friemis.

Now see the pears. The harvest pear,how yellow.
It is ripe, let me pick, and eat it. The sugar pear,
how plump and soft it is ; and what a beautiful red
covers one side of it. See the catherine pear, and
the vergaloo, how rich,jucy, and delicious. But the
peach--how it exceeds all fruit in its delicious fla-
vor; what can equal its fragrance, and how it melts
upon the tongue. The nutmeg, the rare-ripe with
its blushing cheek, the whi 3 cling-stone with its
crimson tints—and the lemu. cling-stone with its
golden hue, and all the varieties of the free stones.
Such are the rich hounties of nature, bestowed on
man to please his taste, preserve his health, and
draw hi.‘ grateful heart towards the Author of his
happiness.

BE not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat,
or what ye shall drink ; nor for yourbody, whcit
ye shall put on ; for your heavenly Father knoweth
that ye have need of these things.

Behold the fowls of the air: For they sow not
neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet
your heavenly Father feedeth them.

Consider the lilies of the ﬁeld, how they grow ;
they toil not, neither do they spin ; and yet Solo-
mon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of
these.

II.
Therefore be not anxious for the good things of

- this life, but seek first the kingdom of heaven and

its righteousness, and all these things shall be ad-
ded to you.
Ask and it shall be given unto you : Seek and
ye shall ﬁnd: Knock, and it shall be opened.
Love your enemies.-, bless them that curse you;
do good unto them that hate you; and pray for
them that scornfully use you and persecute you.

When thou prayest, be not as the hypocrites,
who love to pray standing in the synagogues, and
in the streets, that thev may be seen of men: But
when thou pr _‘»'€St, enter into thy closet, and when
thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is
in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall
reward thee openly.

IV.

Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth,
where moth and rust moth corrupt, and where
thieves break through and steal; but lay up for
yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not
break through and steal : For where your treasure
is, there will your heart be also.

Familiar Lessons.

HENRY is a good boy. Come here, Henry, let
me hear you read. Can you spell easy words? Hold
up your head; speak loud and plain. Keep your
book clean ; do not tear it.

John, keep your seat, and sit still. You must
not say a W!)1‘(l, nor laugh nor play. Look on your
book, learn your letters, study your lesson.

Charles, can you aunt? Try. One, two, three,
four, ﬁve, six, seven,  itrht, nine. ten.--‘Well said;
now spell bird. ‘B-i-1   l-2’-aw the birds sing and
hop from branch to brroch znirmg‘ the trees. They
make nests too, and lay eggs; then sit on their
eggs, and hatch young birds. Dear little birds,
how they sing and play. You must not rob their
nests, nor kill their young: it is cruel.

Moses, see the cat, how quiet she lies by the
ﬁre. Puss catches mice. Did you ever see puss
watching for mice ? How stilland sly. She creeps
along, ﬁxingher eyes steady on the place where the
mouse lies. As soon as she gets near enough, she
darts forward, and seizes the little Vintim by the
neck. Now the little mouse will do no more mis-
chief.

See the little helpless kittens. How warm and
quiet they lie in their bed, while puss is gone.
take them in your hands, don’t hurt them; they
are harmless, and do no hurt. They will not bite
nor scratch. Lay them down softly, and let them
go to sleep. ,

George, the sun has risen, and it is time for you
ti) rise. See the sun, how it shines: it dispels the
iia1‘l(I'ltfSS of night, and makes all nature gay and
aheerful. Get up, Charles; wash your hands,
comb your hair, and get ready for breakfast. VVhat
are we to llm-‘C for breakfast? Bread and mill:

An Easy Standard cy"1’rommciazz'on. 77

This is the best food for little boys. Sometimes
we have coffee or tea, and toast. Sometimes We
have cakes.

James, hold your spoon in your right hand; and
if you use a knife and fork, hold the knife in your
right hand. Do not eat fast: hungfy boys are apt
to eat fast, like the pigs. Never waste your bread;
bread is gained by the sweat of the brow». Your
father plants or sows com; com grows in the ﬁeld ;
when it is ripe, it is cut, and put in the barn ; then
it i-s thrashed out of the ears, and sent to a mill:
the mill grinds it, and the bulter separates the bran
from the flour. Flour is wet with water or milk;
and with a little yeast or leaven, it is raised, and
made light; this is called dough: dough is baked
in an oven, or pan, and makes bread.

Tm: SISTER‘.

Emily, look at the ﬂowers in the garden. ‘What
a charming sight. How the tulips adorn the bor-
ders of the alleys, dressing them with gayety. Soon
the sweet pinks will deck the beds ; and the fragrant
roses perfume the air. Take care of the sweet-
williams, the jonquils, and the artemisia. See the
honey-suckle, how it winds about the column, and
climbs along the margin of the windows. Now it is
in uloom, how fragrant the air around it; how sweet
the perfume, after a gentle shower, or amidst the
soft dews of the evening. Such are the charms of
youth, when robed in innocence ; such is the bloom
of life, when decked with modesty, and a sweet tem-

The cup was all fill‘d, and the leaves were all wet.
And seem’d, at a fanciful view,

To weep \‘Jl:l‘. regret, for the buds it had left,
On the ﬂourishing bush where it grew.

For a nosegay, so dripping and drew n’d;
And shaking it rudely-—v—too rudely, alas,

“ And the tear that is wip’d, with a l‘ttle address,
“ May be follow’tl perhaps with a smile.”

Julia, rise in the morning betimes, dress the bot‘.
tiers of the ﬂower beds, pull up the noxious weeds,
water the thirsty roots. See how the plants wither
for want 01’: rain. The ﬂowers fade, the leaves
shrivel and droop. Bring a little water to refresh
them. Now the plants look green and fresh; the
weeds which shaded c-r robbed their roots of mois-
ture, are removed. and the plants will thrive. Does
the heart want culture ? Weed out the noxious pas-
sions from the heart, as you would hurtful plants
from among the ﬂowers. Cherish the virtues,-—
love, kindness, rneekness, modesty, goodness. Let
them thrive, and produce their natural fruit, pure
happiness, and joys serene through life.

Look to the gentle lambs, how innocent and play-
ful , how agreeable to the sight; how pleasant the
task to feed them ; how grateful they are for your
care. Julia, let me hear your song.

And weeping, spring ﬂow.’rs o’er it laid, ‘

Thus mus’d, “ So it fares with the delicate mind,
" To the tempest of fortune betray’d;

" Too tender, like thee, the rude shock to sustain,
“ And denied the relief which would save,

“ She’s lost, and when pity and lrindness are vain,
“ Thus we dress the poor suiferer’ s grave.”

Harriet, bring your book, let me hear you read.
What book have you? Let me see : a little volume
of poems. How many can you repeat? Let me
hear my dear Harriet speak one.

Prccepts concerning the socio.’ relations.

ART thou a young man, seeking for a partner
for life ? Obey the ordinance of God, and become a
useful member of society. But be not in haste to
marry, and let thy choice be directed by wisdom.

Is a woman devoted to dress and amusement? Is
she delighted with her own praise, or an admirer
of her own beauty? Is she given to much talking
and loud laughter? If her feet abide not at home,
and her eyes rove with boldness on the faces of men
-—-turn thy feet from her, and suffer not thy heart
to be ensnared by thy fancy.

But when thou ﬁnclest sensibility of heart joined
with sofotness of manners ; an accomplished mind
and religion, united with sweetness of temper, mod-
est deportment, and a love of domestic life—Such
is the woman who will divide the sorrows, and don-
ble the joys of thy life. Take her to thyself ; she
is worthy to be thy nearest friend, thy companion,
the wife of thy bosom.

Art thou a young woman, wishing to know thy
future destiny ? Be cautious in listening to the ad-
dresses of men. Art thou pleased with smiles and
ﬂattering words? Remember that man often smiles
and ﬂatters most, when he would betray thee.’

Listen to no soft persuasion, till a long acquain-
tance and a steady respectful conduct have given
thee proof of the pure attachment and honorable
views ofthy lover. Is thy suitcr addicted to low
vices? is he profane? is he a gambler? a ti-pler? a
spendthrift? a l1’&’.lI1tC1' of taxcrns ? has he lived in
idleness and pleasure? has he acquired a contempt
for thy sex in vile coinpany ? and above all, 18 he a
scoller at r liggion ?---Banish such a ntan from thy
presence; his heart is false, and his hand would
lead thee to wretchedness and ruin.

8 2 An Easy Szandczra’ qf Pronunciaziarz

Art thou a husband? Treat thy wife with ten-
derness and respect; reprove her faults with gen-
tleness; be faithful to her in love; give up thy
heart to her in conﬁdence, and alleviate her cares.

Art thou a wife ? Respect thy husband; oppose
him not unreasonably, but yield thy will to his,
and thou shalt be blest with peace and concord;
study to make him respectable, as well for thine
own sake, as for his; hide his faults; be constant
in thy love; and devote thy time to the care and
education of the dear pledges of thy love.

Art thou a parent? Teach thychildren obedience;
teach them temperance, justice, diligence in useful
occupations; teach them science; teach them the
social Virtues, and fortify thy precepts by thine own
example ; above all, teach them religion. Science
and virtue will make them respectable in this life-—
religion and piety alone can secure to them happi-
ness in the life to come.

Artcthou a brother or a sister? Honor thy charac-
terﬁfy living in the bonds of alfectionwith thy breth-
ern. Be kind; be condescending. Is thy brother
in adversity, assist him ; if thy sisteris in distress,
administer to her necessities and alleviate her cares.

Art thou a son or a daughter? Be grateful to thy
father, for he gave thee life; and to thy mother,
for she sustained thee. Piety in a child is sweet-
er than the incense ef Persia, yea more delicious
than odors, wafted, by western gales, from a ﬁeld
of Arabian spic. s. Hear the words of thy father,
for they are spoken for thy good: give ear to the
admonitions of thy mother, for they proceed from
her tenderest love. Honor their gray hairs, and
support them in the evening of life : and thine
own children, in reverence of thy example, shall
repay thy piety with ﬁlial love and duty.

FABLE I.
Of the Boy that stole Apples.

AN old man found a rude boy upon one of his
trees stealing Apples, and desired him to come
down; but the young Sauce-box told him plainly
he would not. Won’t you? said the old Man,
then I will fetch you down; so he pulled up some
tufts of Grass, and threw at him; but this only
made the Youngster laugh, to think the old Man
should pretend to beat him down from the tree
with grass only.

Well, well, said the old Man, if neither words
nor grass, will do, I must try what virtue there is
in Stones; so the old man pelted him heartily with
stones; which soon made the young Chap hasten
down from the tree and beg the old Man’s pardon.

passed in her imagination, when down came
the pail of milk, and with it all her imaginary hap»

T726 Cat and the Rat.

A. CERTAIN Cat had made such unmerciful
havoc among the vermin of her neighborhood, that
net 9. single Rat or Mouse dared‘ venture to appear
abroad. Puss was soon convinced, that if affairs
remained in their present situation, she must be
totally unsupplied with provision. After mature
deliberation, therefore, she resolved to have re-
course to st1'atagen1. For this purpose, she sus-
pended herself from a hook with her he d down-
wards, pretending to be dead.~ The Rats and
Mice, as they peeped from their holes, observing
her in this dangling attitude, concluded she was
hanging for some misdemeanor; and with great
joy immediately sallied forth in quest of their prey.
Puss, as soon as a suflicient number were collected
together, quitting her hold, dropped into the midst
of them ; and very few had the, fortune to make
good their retreaf. This artiﬁce having succeeded
so well, she was encouraged to try the event of a
second. Accordingly she whitened her coat all

over, by rolling herself in a heap of flour, and in

An Easy Stanrjzzru"QfPr072u/zciaziorz. 91
this (liSg‘LLi.S€ layconcealed in the bottom of aemeal
tub. This stratagem was executed in general with
the same effect as the former. _ But an old expe-
rienced Rat, altogether as cunning as his adversa-
rye, was not so easily ensnared. I don’t much like,
said he, that white heap yonder: Something whis-
pers me there is mischief concealed _under it. ’Tis
true it may be meal; but it may likewise be some-
thing that I should not relish quite so well. There
can be no harm at least in keeping at a proper dis-
tance; for caution, I am sure,‘ is the parent of
safety.

FABLE V.

The Fox and the Bramé/c.

A FOX, closely pursued by a* pack of Dogs,
took shelter under the covert of a Bramble. He
rejoiced in this asylum, and for a while, was very
happy ; but soon found that if he attempted to stir,
he was wounded by thorns and prickles on every
side. However, making a virtue of necessity, he
foilore to complain; and comforted himself with
reflecting that no bliss is perfect; that good and
evil are mixed, and ﬂow from the same fountain.
These Briars, indeed, said he, will tear my skin
a. little, yet they keep off the dogs. For the sake
of the good then let me bear the evil with pa-
tience ; ea-ch hitter has its sweet; and tlltsz. Bram.
bles, though they wound my ﬂesh, preserve my
life from danger. i

The Bear and the T we Friends.

T VVO Friends, setting out together upon a
journey’, which led through a dangerous Forest,
mutually promised to assist each other, if they
should happen to be assaulted. They had not pro-
ceededsfar, before they perceived a Bear making
towards them with great rage.

There were no hopes in ﬂight ; but one ofthem_,
being very active, sprung up into a tree; upoh
which the othenthrowing himself ﬂat on the ground,
held his breath and pretended to be dead; remem-
bering to have heard it asserted, that this creature
will not prey upon a dead carcase. The bear came
up, and af:e.r smelling to him some time, left him,

and went on.--When he was fairly out of sight
and hearing, the hero from the tree called out—
Well, my friend, what said the hear? he seemed
to whisper you very closely. He did so, replied
the other, and gave me this good piece of advice,
never to associate with a wretch, who, in the hour

of danger, will desert his friend.
