--The- waters- of the ocean are:observed to flow,' for certain

a very slow and impeP:ceptible motion of the whole body of
water will suffice to raise its surface sevetal feet high'n; but if
the- same increase of water wereJto be conveyed through a
narrow channel, it must necessarily:iush with ilnpetuous

different magnitudes-;_ sometimes rising more'than a thoul

and in-many sixty or eighty broad.  They are usually. dividled by fissures; one piece following another so close, that

Thereare  two sorts of ice floating in these seas; -the flat
ice and the mountain ice:: the-one is formed of sea water,
the other of fresh. The flat, or driving ice, is entirely comnposed ofwsea-water; which, when dissolved, is found: to be

fresh-waterj ice, by.its:whiteness;and: w.vant of transparency.'
This ice jis much more terrible:to mariners than that which

mountains are usually seen in the spring, and after a violent
storm, driving out to sea: where they at first terrify the
mariner;. and are soon after dashed to pieces by the continual washing.of the waves, or driven into the warmer- regions of the south to'be melted away.,

lT e Danger of keeping bad coZnqanyM
T-'E dager ofi keeping bad company  arises principally
fromour: aptness to imitate  and catch the manners and sentimenltsof others.  n our earies  outh the contagion of
manners is bservable. - In the boy yet incapable of having
any learning- instilled into him, we. easily discover from his.first:acti-ons, and -rudee attempts at language, th:e kind of persons with: whom   hehas been brought up: We see the early
"Spring; of-a civilized education, 6i thei first- wild shoots-of
-: As he'-.enters further intolife,his behavior, mrnanners: and,conversation, all-; take their cast from the company  he kee-s.
Observe the peasant and -t-heman of educaion; the difference is striking.  And yet God hasbestowed equal- talents
on each the only:differen:e is, they h-:ave been thrown'into
different scenes of life,and hav had- cQmmerce with persons
of different -stations.::   - -'  --'Nor are manners andtbellavior more easily caught, than
Opinions and principles. In childhood and youth we na tu
-rally adopt th'e. sentimtents of those about-us: and, as we ada
~vancice-in life, low few-of us thinkfor ourselves!. how many
of us are satisfied with taking our opinions at second
hand! -   -: -      -:'   -
- The great power of customri-forms a-other argument
against_ keeping bad comnpany. However shocked we maybe at.the first approaches of vice, this- shocking appearance: goes: off upon an intimacy- with- it,. Custom will
soon render tlemost -disgustful object'familiar to our view;'and this is $indeed a kind provision of nature, to render labor,'and toil,'and- dan,ger, more easy?to man. The raw
soldier, who.tr'embles- at the first encounter, becomes a
hardy veteran in.a. few campaignbs. eHabit renders danger
fmiliar,and.of course indifferent-to him..:
But habit, which is intended. for our good, m'y, i-iike, other
kind appointments.of natre', be converted"l into a mischief.
The well disposed youth, entering first into bad conmpany,
is shocked at wbhat he sees and what he hears. The goodaOn the Air and artoIilere.
principles which he had imblibed, ring in his ears an alarming lesson against the wickedness of his companions., But,
alas!,.this Sensibility' is only of a day's continuance. The next
jovial meeting makes the horrid picture of yesterday more
easily endured, Virtue is soon thought a severe rule; an
-inconvenient restraint: a'few pangs of conscience now and
then whisper-to himthat he once:-hadd better thoughts: but
even these by degrees die away, and he who'at first was
-shoCked evenat:the appearance of.vice, is formed by custom
into a profligate leader of vicious pleasures.--how carefully.theni should we oppose. the first'approaches of sin:! how
vigilant should we be against so itnsidious an. enemy:
0-. -,---;:. --
AIR, ina general sense is that invsible fluid surrounding
our globe, on which depends: notonanima i  but vegetable
life;-' and which appears to be one of the-great agents employed by nature, in carrying on her operations throughout
-the worid.  
The.discoveries respecting the nature of'air, have not
been more interesting to philosophers, than useful to science
and beneficial to society. Many perplexing processes in
chemistry have been explained in consequence. of them, several have been facilitated, and a number of new and useful
ones have been introduced..; The. knowledge of the use of
air in respiration, the method of ascertaining its puri.ty and
fitness for that function, and.the discovery of the.medicinal
properties Qf some kinds of air, all promise to be of considerable advantage. The method of ascertaining the purity
of the air of a place, and the mode of ventilating.an apartment, are- of great utility.... In short, there is perhaps no
station in life where some knowledge'of this subject may
not be important and beneficial,122On the Airlzd-4tnmosIlheCre.
That:most stupendous body of air the atmosphere, whic,l
every where: surrounds ourgl-obe, consists of-a pellucid, elastic. compound, whlich we denote by the name of common, or
atmospheric'air.. It is. found to consist chiefly of two fluids  
mixed together, widely differing i their nature. -The largest-:part, exceeding the rest three-times -or more in bulk,
is" fit neither for supporting fire nor for respiration.  The.
other-is.called oxygen or-vital air, which differs widely from
the preceding, being-indispensably necessary to fire and: ani.mal! respiration.The atmosphere -may. be looked upon not only as the genecal receptacle of the- aqueous vapours of the sea and
rivers,  but likewise of all- mineral exhalations.; of -the
streams which are constantly arising from the perspiration
of: whatever enjoys, -animal or vegetable life, and-fiom the
putrefaction of-these substances when d-ead;. of the smaller
seeds,of- ierrestrial and aquatic plants-;.-of the eggs of all
infinity of species of imperceptible animalcules; of the'
acids and -oils separated by- combustion from  all sorts of
fuel; of the: matter of light; of the electric fluid, and of
a variety of other substances, which are elevated, and. for a
time kept suspended, by naturalcauses.-     -' -
-Be'sides its gravity, which the: air has in common with
water and other.fluids, -it-possesses elasticity; by which it
allows itself-to be compressed into a smaller bulk, and rerurms to its original..volume -when the pressure is removed.
Thus, a blown bladder being squeezed in the hand, we find
the included air sensibly resist; so that, upon our ceasing to
com press; it, the-cavities or impressions:made in its surface -
readily- expand again.and are -filled-- up.  It.is this property
of elasticity, joined to fluidity, that constitutes an air, or gas.
Itis in the atmosphere that- the clouds are assembled- which
assume such a variety of hues and-forms, and which,- as they
are condensed  or-.rarefied, retain the vapours, or return
them to the earth in rain, haili or snoW.--:.The winds are another important part of the subject of
~air, and are in various ways not -only salubrious but highly
beneficial to man.  Continual vicissitudes give a turn- to the
dispositions and productions of nature; -they correct those
123,124  Yrouth tie easozforori     vtuous habits.
ill consequences which would unvoidably flow from a too te.
dious inacti-vity and state of rest;-theyinvigorate and purify
the'air, by keeping it in perpetual motion. -Without them
our'habitations -would become- unwholesome, and great
towns. would in -a short time become exceedingly nauseous;,
in fine, nature wouild languish and die.  "      ~
No poison is more subtle'than the air which is- left after
respirable air is destroyed. Plants, wllen exposed to the
influence of the sun, correct the vitiated air occasioned -by
~.the breat hing of animals and other processes;'but.placed
out of the influence of the sund they infect the air so as to
occasion the extinction of life. --'- -'-: -
-Man has no reason' to complain that' cmmon. air is not
zvital air.- I tf it were, his life would soon be at'an end, and
all tbhe vegetable- world would p.?erish:. On the other hand ifits portion of oxygen were much les:, plants indeed Would
vegetate better, but all -animated nature would soon be extinct. - The:bounty of Providence has` wisely establi shed a
due- medium,' by which.he existence of both is maintained:.
In all the surprising elaboratio-lnsof these- fluids, the Ieaves
are' the principal instruments:;- the varnished superior surface imubibes the essential particles, whicli after elaboration
are by the inferior poured -fo rtl in pure but invisible
stieams.  -While: the heats of p-summer -prevail, these
streams are the, most plentiful. Hence, at least in our tem.p eriate climates, the atmoslhere is best in the height of summer, and in-the-height of wiiter; for in. the first, the. vgetable world.is in its:greatest vigour; and in- thhe second, the
general tendency to:corruption has: ceased

wisdom to consider, that a tim'e will come when youth and
health, wvil fail us; and if disappointment and vexation do

MOD.R N Rome, which stands on -the Campus Martius::&amp;c. is thirteen miles in circumference. -Withinits circuit
there is a:vast number-of gardens and vineyards. -Itstands
upon the Tiber, an inconsiderable river when compared to
the Thames, and: navigatedl by small boats, barges, and
iighters.  The castle of St Angelo, though its chief fore
tress, wouldt be found to be of small strength, were it freg-blarly besieged. The city, standing upon the ruins of ancient Rome, lies much higher, so that it is difficult to distinguish the seven hills on which it was originally built.
XWhen:we consider RomeCas it now stands, there is the:strongest reason to believe.:that it exceeds ancieit Rome it--
self in- the magnificence of its structure.  Nothing in the
old city, when mistress of the world, could come in competition-with St. Peter's church;.an perhaps many other
churches in- Rome exceed, in beauty of architecture, and:value of materials, utensils, and furniture, her ancient_ temples; though it must be -acknowledged that the Pantheon
was an amazing -structure. No city, however, in its general
appearance, can unite more magnificence and poverty than.this, as adjoining the most superb palaces we see the meanest
habitations; and temples, the boasted ornaments of antiquity, choked up by shels and cottages. -
The principal and most admired street, is but little wider
thanSt. Martin's lane in London;but this mode of building.
their streets so narrow is done with a view of intercepting,
as muh as possible, the sun's heat. The inhabitants of

Thel city of' Naples, the populous capital of the kingdom

where it not for its vicinity to the' volcano of Vesuvius,
which sormetimes': thre;atenslthe,city. with destruction, and
that the soil is pestered with insects and reptiles, some oft'which are venomous. The houses: in Naples are inadequate
to the-, population, but in general are five or six stories in
h:eiglht, and flaat t the top;'on which are placed numbers of
flower -vases,- or fruit-trees in boxes of earth,- producing a
very gay and agireeable effect.- Some of the streets are very
handsome:no street in Rome equals in, beauty the Strada di,Toledo at Naples; and still lesscan any of them be compared
with those beautiful streets that lie open to-the bay. The
richest and most commodious convents in Europe, both for:ale anrd female votarieLs, are inthiscity;. the most fertile
and beautiful hills of the enviros are covered --with them
and a small part of their revenue is spent in feeding the
poor0, themonks distributing'bread and soup to a certain
number every day before the doors of each convent.

faint'with:thirst, stood'af the -onimon" boundary of their
grounds, with their flocks and iherds panting round them,
and in extremity of distress prayed fr; water.:On a sudden
the air was becalmed, the birds ceased' to chirp, and the
flocks to bleat. They turned theiri eyes every wa`, and
saw a beingof mighy stature, advancing through the valley, whom they knew on his nearer, approach to be the
genius'of disfribution. In one hand he held the sheaves of:
plenty, and'in the other the sabre of destruction  
I 20128 - V~     7e Golden Akeant

Then turning to Raschid, the. genius invited lhim like,
wise to-offer'his petition. I request, says Raschid, that:thou -wilt turn the- Ganges through my grounds, with all

spoke,: Rash: man; be not insatiable!; Remember, to thee
that is nothing, which thou can'st not use; and how are thy
wants. greater than the wants of Hamet?
Raschid repeated: his- desirel and pleased himself with
the mean appearance that Hamet would make in the-pre.

retired; towards the river, and the two shepherds stood

_population at tis time might amount to -twele hundred
-thlousand men: but! the-noblet s were totally sunkin luxury
and effeminacy; and the populace, vile and:' wretched, had
been. contintually recruited by the manumission of slaves, or
-the influx of f6o reigners; In seucli a state of universal degeneracy, the Romans were rather disposed to negotiate than
to fight; iand therefore received: as emperor Attalus, the
prefect of the city,.who was obtruded on-them by Alaric
-king of the Goths.     -

THE negroesof- Africa form a well-defined and striking
variety; of our species, Which ma be called the fourth.'This sa ble race is extended ove r all the southern- parts of

African negroes is flabb,,and; the' whole rhamnie relaxed;
while-their mental powers in:general participate the imbecility of their bodies. Theirgeeius is extremely limited:they are indolent, andl often mischievous; they possess few
qutalities that can attract regard, yet th6eir feelings are acute,
and they are capable of the greatest extremes both of love
and hatred: religion, reason-, aid humanity, therefore, all
conspire, to induce us to0 treat them, when in,' our powers
with mildness; or rather, tdo ldave them unolested- in their

FVarieties of the Human Race. (Continued.)
-THE sixth antd last grand division of the-human' race, and
the..most elevated in the scale of' being, comprehends the
Europeans, and those -of European origin; among whom
may be classed the Georgians, Circassians and -Mingrelians,
the. natives of Asia Minor, andthose. of the nortlihern parts of
Africa, together with a part of those co':tries that lienorth
wvest of the Caspian Sea.-.:.....''.: The inhabitants of countrie so extensive, and so widely
separated, must be expected' to vary a:good. deal from each
other; but in general, there is a st'riking-:uniformity in the
fairness of theirl complexions, the beauty and proportion of
their limbs,-and the'extent of..their capac,ity.'"Arts which
are but partially practised, or little known, in, other-countri'es,;are he're. brought to-great perifection: and among the
natives of the countries now under consideration, the highest endowments of the understanding, the best virtues of
*the heart,.what ever can improve dor- adorn'human nature
are-to be found in an' eminent degree.
To some one of the classes' already enumerated, the people,of every country may be referred; and' in proportion as
nations'have,been less visited by'strangers, oir have maintaintained less intercourse with' the' rest of mankind, we
find th-eir. persons and  manners more strongly impressed
with some ofthe characteristics above'mentioned.. On the
contrary., in.thoseplaces where. trade h'as long flourished,or
whichl have been exposed to frequent,host.ile invasions, the
races Usually appear -blended;''and.: proably fall under no
one particular variety, but- partake in- some respect of all.:
It -is: undeniable, that of all- colo'lrs by which mankind is
diversified,!white is not only the most beautiful, but also'
th,e. most expressive. The fair complexion becomes like a
transparent veil to'the'soul; through-'which every shade of
pa.sion, every chance of health, may be seen without the
necessity of oral utterance:..'whereas in the African biack,

are those fisheries. At the beginning ofthe:season there:areT sometimes ttwo hundred and fifty barks on the banks;
the larger barks have two divers; and the smaller, one
each.  As -soon as the barks arrive at the.-place where the
fish lie, -and have:cast anchor, each diverbinds a-stone, six
inches: thick and a. foot'long, under" his body; which serves
him:as-ballast, prevents his being driven away by the motion of the water, and enables him to- walk more steadily under the waves.:They also tie another v\rey heavy stone to
one foot, by wlIich they are very speedily sent to the -bottom
f othe sea; and as the-oysters arie usually firmi:fastened to
the rocks,: they arm,- their lands with leathern -mittens, to
prevent their being bruisedp;n pulling. the oysters violently
off; but this- is sometimes performed -with an iron rake.
Lastly, each diver carries-doq n with him a large: net in the
manner of a sack, tied to his neck bya -long cord, the other
end-of which:is fastened t te side:of the barkl. - This net is
to hold the oysters-gathered from the rock, and:he cord is:to pull up the diver when his, bag is full,-or when he wants
-air.,....... -
i Thus eqlipped, he sometimes )recipitates himself sixty
feet under- water; and as he has no time to'lose,:lhe no' sooner
-arrives at the bottom, than-, he begins to run firom side to
side,. tearing up all tle oysters he meets with, and putting
them with--the utmost expedition into his net.:At whatever depth the.divers are, the light is so great
that they easily see all that passes in the sea, -and sometimes,;to" their great-- consternation, perceive the approach
of enormous fishes, to which their dexterity in muddying
the water does not -always save -them from: becoming~a
prey: and of all the dangers attending the fishery this is the
greatest and:the most usual.The best divers will keep under water near half an hour,
and the least skilful do not stay -less than a quarter. During

-NEAR Laugervatan, a small' lake about two days journeydistant from-mount Hecla, says a traveller, we beheld tle
steam of the hot spring rig i ng eight different places, one
of which; continually threwv up:into the air a column ofwa-,ter from eighteen totwenty-four feet high. The water was:extremely hot, -so that-a piece -of mutton -and some salmon'
trouts were almost'boiled topieces in it in six minutes.:
-At,-Gyser, not far from Skalholt, one- of the episcopal
sees in Iceland, -within the circumference of hree English
miles forty or fifty boiling springs are seen togethers; and
the liargest, which is in the middle, particularly engaged
odur attention the- whole of thed-ay that we spent here. TIhe
aperture through:-which the water arose is nineteen feet
in diameter; nd roundl the top is a bason nine feet higher
than ithe conduit. Here the water does not-spout continually,:but onlylby interval sseveral tsmes a day and, asJ I was inoirmed-by - the Icelanders,l' in wet-:weather high er, than at

the water had not risen above the margin of:the pipe; but'
now it began by degrees to fill the: upperbason, and at last
to run over. -: v Or guides told usthat'the water would soon,
spout up much higher than it hbaddone.'  - -:    - -: Soon afte.r four o'clock we "observed that Athe earth-began

-we wish they should do to us.'There are indeed some moral duties of a much highe, but none of a more amiable nature-;-and.I  do not hesitate to place it,atthe-he ad of the mi---
nor,virtues., - -
T.-Te'manner-of conferring -fvours-- or benefits. is, as to
pleasing almost as importa- as t.:hematter itself. Take
care,.then, never to throw away the obligations,which pe.rhaps you may have: it in yourpower to.cnfer upon others,
yan airof insolent protection or by a cold and comfortless
-manner, which stiflesthem in their. birth. Humanity inclines,,religion' requires, and our moraldutiesoblige us, as
far as we are able, to'elieve the distresses and miseraie of
our fellow creatures: but thisis not all-;for aotrue heart-felt
benevolence and. tenderness will prompt- us to contribute
w'hat we can to their.ease- their_amusement, and their-pleal
sure, as far as innocently we'may..Let us thennot only
scatter benefits, but even strew' flowers,g for our fellow-travellers in the rugged ways ofthis wolqd..:  -..  
There are some,- who, without the least visible taint of ill
nature or malevolence seem to:be totally indifferent, and'do not shovthe'least desire to' please; as, on the other
hand, they never.designedly offend. Whether this proceed
from a lazy, negligent, and listless disposition, froma.gloomy and melancholic -nature, from i ll heath, low spirits, o r
from a secret and sullen pride,. arising from the conscious
-ness of-their' boasted liberty and. independence, is hard to
determine, considering the various movements of the uman.
-heart, and the wonderful errors of the human head. But,
be the.cause what it will, ithat neutrality,-which is the effect
of it, makes these people, mere blanks in soiety. They
-would surely be roused from their indifference, if they woutild
ser-iously consider the greatutility of-pleasing.
-The person who manifests a cotstant desire to please, places
hnis stock of merit, through perhaps small, at.grea it.iterest.
What.vast returns, then, must real:merit, when thus adorn.
ed, necessarily bring in!  Aprudent usurer would Wvith
transport place his last-shilling at such interest, and upo
so solid a security.        -

With snow:and ice,whicdoes not melt even in summer
-and,'where the- chan iis interrupted, bogs and maslses: fill
up the space.  Winter is feltduring the greater part of the
year: a deep. snow overwhelms'the valleys, and covers the
little hills; and for a long time the sun never rises above
their' ho-rizon. r. Tlhe inhabitants seek shelter from the cold
in tents, which':can be removed from one pla:ce to another.
They fix-their fire-place in the middle of the tent, and.suri  
round it with stones.:; The smoke goes -out at a hole in the
top, whichi also serves them for a window.-- The chaldrons
in w'hich they dress.their food, and: melt the ice for drink,
are huntg on chains fastened to the -roof.: The inside of the.tent is furnlished witifurs-, which preserve th eni from the'
cold; and they lie: on skins of animals,  spread -upon:the:gr ound.-. Jt is- in such habitations that the Laplanders pass
their wintetr, surrounded by the howling wolves, which- are
roaming every-where in search:-of prey.  How could we
bear the climlate and vay of life of these people? How much
we should'thinlk ou selves t l be pitied&amp;,if we had nothing before oUr eyes'but a vast eXtent of ic, and whole deserts covered with snow.; the absence of the sun making the cold
still more - insupportable!-and if, instead: of a convenient
dwelling, we had only movable tents made of skins; and no
other resource -for our subsistence but in painful and dangeroushunting!:'  
Are-not these reflections proper to make us observe the
many advantages of our climate, to which we attend so little?
Ought they not. to animate us to bless the Divine Providence for the many thousand advantages we enjoy? Yes:
let us ever bless that wise Providence; and when we feel the
severitry of the season, let us return thanks, that the'cold is
so- moderate where we dwell, and that we have such numerous-ways of-guarding against it.  -
Butis the inhabitant of northern countries so unhappy as
we imagine? It is true that he'wanders painfully through
rough-valleys and unbeaten roads, and that he is exposed to
the inclemency of the seasons. But his hardy body is able.
to bear fatigue. If the Laplander be poor and deprived of
many of the,conveniences of life that we enjoy; is he not

and useful employment for time. You are never at a loss
hoQw to dispose of your hours, or tofill up life agreeably.
In the course of human action, there are two extremes
equally dangerous to virtue; the multiplicity of affairs, and
the total want of them. The man oforde-r stands in the middie between these two extremes, and suffers from neither:
he is.occupied, but not oppressed; whereas the disorderly,
overloadingione part of time, and leaving another vacant,
are at one period overwhelmed with business, and at. another either idle through want of employment, or indolent
through perplexity.  Those seasons of indolence and idleness, which recur so often in their ilifee are their most; dangerous moments. The mind, unhappy-in its situationi and
clinging to. every object which  an occupy; or amuse it, is
then aptest to to throw itself into the arm's of vice and folly.
Further, by the preservation lof order'you check inconstancy and levity. i: Fickle by nature is-the human heart. It
is fond of change, and perpetually tends -to start- aside from
the straight line of conduct. Hence arises the propriety of
~being subject to method and::rule, which, though at first' it
may prlove constraining, yet bydegrees, and from the experip
ence of its- happy effects, becomes easy and agreeable: It
rectifies those irregularities of temper and manners, to
which we give the:name of caprice;; and which are distinguished characteristics of a disorderly mind.- It is the parent eof steadiness of conduct, and forms consistency of cha-:racter. It is                the dtheconfidence werepose i

his extraordinary-power of eloquence over the minds of
men; and not being able to resist its charms, h-egave him?
self up to it. Thenceforth he renounced all other studies
and pleasures;-and during the continuance of Callistratus at
Athens.he never quitted him, but made all the improvement
he could trom his precepts.  -
The:'first essay- of his eloquen e was- against his guar.
dians, whom he obliged to-:refund' a part of -his fortune. Entcouraged by this success, he ventured -to speak before the,people, but with very il! success.-~' He had a weak voice, a
thick:way of speaking, and a -very: short- breath; notwith;:standin:g which, his periods were: so Iongs, -:that he--was often
oblig ed to stop in the midst of them to take breath. This
occasioned his being hissed;by; the whole audience. -
As he-withdrew, -hanging,down his head, and in the ut- most confusion, satyrus, one of t-he most excellent actors of
those times, who was hisfriiend, met him; -and having learnt
from himself the cause of hisbeing so much deJected, he as.
sured him that the evil was not without remedy, and that the
case -as_ ot so desperate-as he imagined.- He desired hinm
-to repeat-som-e of the verses of Sophocles-or Euripides to
him; which he accordingly did. satyrus spoke them after
him, and gave them such graces, by the tone, gesture, and
-spirit, witIh whichl het pronounced them,~ that: Demosthenes
himself found them quite different'from what they Were iw i

Fxw faults of style, whether real or imaginary, excite the
malignity of a more numerous class of readers, than the use
of liard words. -
If an author be suppsed to involve his thoughts in voluntary obscurity,u and  obsobstruct, by unnecessary difficulties, a mind eager in pursuit of truth; if he write not to
nake others learned, but to-boast the lbarning which he possesses himself; he counteracts th:e first end of writing, and
justly.suffers the utmost severity of censure, or the more
afflictive severity of ne glect.' But words are only hard to
those who do not understand them; and the critic ought always to inquire, whether he be incommoded by the fault of
the writer, or by his owl.:The Guardian directs one ofhis pupils "to think with the
wise, but speak with the vulgar."  This is a precept specious enough, but not always practicable. Difference of
thboughts will produce difference of language.,He who
thinks with more extent than anotlier, will want words of
larger meaning; he that thinks with more subtilty, will seek
for-termsi: of more nice discrimination; and where is the
wonder, since words are' but the images of things, that
hhiwho never knew the -origihals shoul not know the co.
pies.  
Among the hard words whicli are no more. to be used, it
has been long- the customn to number terms of art. But
every hour produces. instances of the necessity:of terms of art.
It is by: necessity that every science and every trade has its
peculiar language. Th-ey wlio content themselves with general ideas may rest in general terms; but.they whose stu--
dies or employments force them- upon closer inspection,
must have names for particular parts, and-words by which
they may express various modes of combination.
Artists are indeed sometimes ready to suppose, that none
can be strangers to words to which themselves are familiar,
talk t.o an inddental inqiu r as they talk to one anotbherd brief;survey of tlie tnive"rs.

and- make their knowledge ridiculous by injudicious: obtrusion. An art cannot be taught but by its proper terms, but it
-is not always necessary to teach the art.
T'hat.the vulgar express'their thoughts clearly is far from
i.tiue;.and' what perspicuity can lbe found' amon.g them proceeds not from the easiness of their language,nbu t the shallowness of their thoughts. He that:sees a buil dingasa:ommon
spectator, contents himself with relating that it. is great or
little,' mean or splendid;, lofty or l.w':; all these words are'
intelligible and common, but the'y con.ey no limited ideas;
if he attempt, without the terms of architecture, to delineate
the parts, or enumerate the ornaments, his narration at once
becomes unintelligible.'-: The terms, indeed, generally disl)lease, because they are understood by few; but they are
littie' understood, only because few that look upon an edifice
examine its parts, or analyse its columns into their members.
Thestate'of othlier every art.is thesame; asit is cursorily
surveyed or accuiately examined, different forms of expression, become proper. In'moralit, it iis one thing to discuss the
niceties of the causuist, and another to direct the practice of
comrmon life. In agriculture, he that instructs the farmer
to p-lough and' sow, nlay convey'his notions without the'
words which -he would find necessary in explaining to philosophers the process of vegetation; and if he who has nothing to eo to  to be honest by the shortest way, will perplex hism-nind with suibtle speculations; or ifhe whose task
is to reap and. thresh, will not be contented without examining the evolution of.the seed and:circulation of the sap, the
writers whom eithler shall consult are' very little to be blam'
ed,.though it should sometimes hllappen that they are.read in

so many suns suspended by the Almighty, to give light and
heat to worlds, which roll around them. "' The heavens declare the glory of God, and the- firmament sheweth his landy work." The royal poet -.who exp,ressedhimself with such
loftiness-of sentiment-was not aware that the stars he contenplated Nyere in reality suns  l He anticipated these times
and first sung that majestic hymn, which future and more
enlightened ages should chant forth in praise to tle founder
of worlds.  
The lassemblage of these vast bodies is divided into dif.
ferent systems, the number of which probably surpasses the
grains of sand whicl the sea-'casts on its-shores.
-Each system  has in its centre or focus, a star or sun,
round which several orders of opake bodies revolve, reflecting with more or less brilliancy the light they borrow from
itb which renders them visible to us.
- From what we know of our own system it may be reason-ably concluded.that all the rest are in wisdom, provided
with acc3mmodation for rational inhabitants. Let-us take
a survey of the system to which we belong, thle only one
accessible to us, and we shall be better enabled to judge of
the nature and end of the other systems of the universe.:If we examine'the sky in a clear night, we shall observe
some stars whose light is more steady than that of the rest,
and if our observations be continued for several nights, we
shall fild that they are continually changing their places in
-the Heavens. T'hose are called planets or wandering stars.
There are eleven primary or principal ones which revolve
Pround the sun as a centre, each in its own orbit; and eighteen called secondaries or moons which move round their
primaries, accompanying them as satellites in their annual
revolution.
-Modern astronomy has greatly enlarged our knowledge
of the boundaries of the solar system. --Since the telescope
has been in use several have been-discovered which before
were not known to us, and by more perfect instruments and
more accurate observers, further-discoveries will probably
be made..-   brief suravey of the Universe,'    51; The Comets which have been considered -as meteors, are
fiound to be a species of planetary bodies.- Their long routes
-are calculat-edl by astronpmers, who can foretel their distant
return. Many of these bodies acknowledge- the empire of
our sun,though the orbits of some of- them are so extensive,
that ages are necessary for the completion of a revo.lution
In a word, it is from modern astronomymwe learntthat the
stars are innumerable, and that, the constellations, in which
the ancients reckoned but a few, are now known to contain
thouandsamd..
The diameter of the'orbit. which our earth describes is
more.than one hundred and ninety -millions of miles: yet
t,his vast extent is considered as a mere point when the as.
tronomer; wishes to use it as a measure to ascertain the diss
tance ofthe fixed- stars;  How great'.is the bulk of these luo'minaries- which are perceptible by us at such enormous dis?
tances-'
The fixed stars being.at such;immense distances friom the
sun cannot.possibly receive from.him sufficient brightness.to render them visible to us.'hey thetherefore,like the sun
~shine with their own- native and unborrowed lustre.
t is not probable' that the; Almighty, wh does nothing in.vain, should create so many:glorious suns, and place them at,uch distances fiom one another, without proper objects near
enough to be benefitt'ed bytlleir influence. Instead then,of
one sun, and one'world only in the-Universe, as the unskiltul
in astronomlyimagine, this science:discovers to us an incon,
e-ivable number of suns, systems, and Worlds, dispersed

General Rules for the Alttainment of Knowledge:
DE eEPLY impress your mind with the vast importance of
a sound judment, and t-he rich and inestimable advantage of
right reasoning.  Review the instances of your own misconduct in life, and observe how many. follies and sorrows you
would have escaped, if from your early years you had taken due pains to judge: aright concerning persons, times, and
things. This will, awaken you to the work of' improving
your reasoning powers, and'of seizing every opportunity
and advantage for this end.
Take a survey of the extensive regions of learning. Let
your meditations. run over the names of all. the sciences,
with their numerous branching, and particular themes of
knowledge, and then reflect with'how few of them youare acquainted.  The most learned, will' never find occasion to act over, again what is fabled of Alexander the
Great; that-when -he had conquered -what was called the
Eastern world, he weptifor want of more worlds to conquer.
Read the accounts of those who have been eminent for
the-almost incredible advances they have:made in the numerous branches of science. Acquaint yourself with some
persons of great learning, that, by comrparing yourself with
t'hem, you may acquire a just opinion' of'your own attainments, and he animated with a genetous and laudable emu
lation to equal, or exceed them. But remember', if upon a
few superficial acquirenments yout value and exalt yourself,
as though you wet e already learned, you are thereby erect
ing abarrier against all imnprovement.
Presume not too much upn a bright genius, a ready wit,
and good parts; flor these wvithout labour and sttudy will never make a iman of knowledge'and wi'sdom.  Persons of a
gay and vigorous fancy have often fallen into this mistake.

4n Account of the retuction of the Ale.'ndrian  L-ary.
Tuv. Alexandlrian library was the most celebrated in the
world. It was founded by Ptolemy Soter, who assumed the
sovereignty of Egypt on tle de:athi- of Alexander, and augn
mnented-by his -successolrs, till it contained:seven- hluncred
thousand; volumes.' When Alexandria was besieged  by
Juliu:s Cesar, one part of it, with four hundred thousand vo.
lumes, was burned  to ~ashles.  Cleopatra added to the remaindei; two hundred thusand volumes froim the Pergamean library given her by Mark Antony;  and subsequent addition's made it- rnre numerous thfi betre: During therevolutions inl the'decline of the Roman empire it vas o-ften plundered, and again- repielnished  itl books.
- -When Alexandria- was -taken -by -the Mohammedans,
nAmrou, their commarder, found there one. Philoponus,  a
lea.nedl man; and, as AmrouL was a lover of letters, the
conversation of Philoponus higlilydelig-hted him.  On a
certain day w     henyt-he were together Philoponius said to
Amrou, You. have visited all: the repositories or plblic'ware,-'houses in Alexandria,-and you have sealed up things of every sort that are to be found iin:"tlie`. tm,- As to those tliings
that may be useful to- )Cou,:i presiume to say nothing; but as
to things of no service to you,:som-e of them perhaps may
be more suitablle to me. - -:.-      --
And what is it that youWant,? sai:d AmrIou. The philosophical -books, replied- Philoponus, preserved iln the royal
libraries. This said.Amrou, is a reqtlest uponiwhich- I
cannot decide." You desire a thingwh-ereupon I dare issue
no orders, till I have leave firom 0: mar, the commander of
the faithful.
Letters were. immediately written to Omarby Ammrou,;infor ming him of What Philoponus had-: requested  arid an
answer -xvas returned by Onar to tie following purpoirt.

-that is sufficient. But if there be anythinrg in them- repug,
nant to t:tat book, we in no respect want them. I command
you,-th'ereree to- order them all to be destroyed.::
Amrou upon this ordered thlden to be dispersed through
the baths of Alexandria, and to be, tlere  burnt in makingthe baths warm.  Aftel this manner: in the space of six
months they wee aall consumed.::.:.'Thle historian,'havil  elated:this:stoy, adds froi  his

till  sinks lelow the' hoizon, and withdraws- the cheering influece whicli he has' shed over nature. -
- After:conntinuing invisible--for.some time, the sun re-app- ears near:: the same place: where' he formerly rose to our
view.'He eagain traversesethe heavens, and: sinks belowi the
ve"rge of the distant landscape;. Since: the: sun is stationary
in the centre of the- planetary system, his apparent motion
through the lheavens, must:arise' from the motion of.the

J'une; th-e Chinese, and,most of the Indians, begin it. with
the first moon in March; and the Greeks with the newo
noon that follows the sumnter solstice*.

good to have such aquality asl he pretends to?:to counterfeit
and diss-emble is.to put on the appearance of some real excellency., Now the best way for a man' tosSeen to be any
thing, is really to be what we would seemto be. t -'.It'is -hardi to personate and acta part long; for where
truth is not at the bottom, nature-will always be- endeavoring

sinicerity is true wisdom., i:::::Particularly, as' to the affairs'of this world integrity has

-Truth is always consistent with itself, and needs nothing,to help it out:-it is always near at hand, sits upon our lips
and is readyi-to drop out. before.we are aware' a lie is troublesome,.and sets a man's invention upon the rack.'-It is
like building'upon a false foundation,' which. continually
Stands in need-of props to support it, and proves at- last
more chargeable, than to have raised a substantial building
at first upon a true and solid foundation. Sincerity isfirm
and substantial-,; there. is,nothing hollow or unsound in it;
and, because it is plain and: open, it fears no discovery. Of
this the crafty man is always in d-nger, and when lihe thinks
he walks in the dark, all his pretences are so transparent,that he that runs-may read them; he is the'last man that
finds himself to be found out; and while he takes it for gr anted that he,'makes fools of others, he renders himself ridiculous.  
Add'toall this, sincerity is the most compendious wis,
dom, and an excellent instrument for the speedy dispatch
of business; by creating confidence in those we have to
deal with, it saves tlhe labor of many inquiries, and brings
things"to,an issue in:few words;,it is like travelling in a
plain beaten road,'hich commonly brings a man sooner to
his journey's end than by-ways, in which men often lose
