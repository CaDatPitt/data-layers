25THE FIRST LESSONS IN NUMBERS has been prepared in
the belief that the objective presentation of numbers is
best suited to the comprehension of the child. The
teacher who uses this book is expected to make constant use of counters, blocks, or other visible objects,
that from the outset the child may have correct ideas
of numbers. The copious illustrations found throughout the book are intended as aids in this direction.
The development of numbers and the unfolding of
processes are very simple and gradual, to correspond to
the powers and growth of the child's mind. Addition
and Subtraction are presented as converse operations,
and are to be taught together, as are also Multiplication
and Division. Experience has shown that this method
secures the best results in the shortest time.
From the beginning oral and slate exercises are combined, the little learner being given something to employ
his hands as well as his mind. The large number and
variety of written exercises will be appreciated by
teachers as relieving them from the necessity of furnishing much blackboard work.LESSON 19.
