-. 8494.part of that night in taking the filling from the "back
doorway."
She said a great deal to Nathaniel about taking care
of little Polly, - told him that if any bad Indians came to
the door, he must catch hold of her hand and run just as
fast as he could, through the; "back way," to Mrs. Moore's.
10. While she was talking to Nathaniel, in the way I
have said, they all heard a step outside. It was then a
little after daybreak. Some one tapped at the door, and
a strange voice said, "A friend, open quick!" She opened
the door and found a white man standing there. This
white man told her that unfriendly Indians were prowling
about to rob, to kill, and to burn dwelling-houses.
The man was a messenger sent to warn people. As
soon as he had gone Florinda double-barred the door, raked
up the fire, put on her things and the children's things, and
got ready to go over with them to Mrs. Moore's. But
before starting she opened the shutter a crack and looked
out and saw two Indians coming toward the door.
She whispered to Nathaniel, " Run! Run! You'll have
time! I'11 keep them out till you get away!"  He heard
the Indians yell and saw Florinda brace herself against
the door.
11. Nathaniel ran with little Polly, and on the way
they met the young man, David Palmer, creeping along
with his gun. He was coming to tell Florinda to hurry-46 85 B.away. He presently saw two Indians start from  the
house and run into the woods. He then crept round the
corner of the house.  The door had been cut away.
Florinda lay across the chest, dead, as he thought,- and
indeed she was badly hurt.;i..:.....  /.;'         i  (
FLORINDA DEFENDS THE HOUSE- AGAINST THE INDIANS.
David Palmer did everything he could do to make her
show some signs of life. At last Florinda came to her
senses. She soon recovered and lived to a good old age,
and often told her adventure with the Indians to her
grandchildren.
Glancing toward the door, David saw a man on horseback, leading a horse with his right hand, and with his
left drawing something heavy on a sled.-la 86 8.12. As the man on horseback came nearer, it proved to
be Mr. Moore. He was leading Mr. Bowen's horse with
his right hand, and with the other he was dragging along
Mr. Bowen on Philip's hand sled.
Coming home from Dermott's Crossing Mr. Bowen had
been taken sick and was only able to travel slowly, with
Mr. Moore's assistance. When they had nearly reached
home, Mr. Moore's dog in racing through the woods
found Philip's sled in a clump of bushes and barked till
the men went to the spot. Mr. Moore covered the sled
with boughs, laid Mr. Bowen on them, and drew him
along.
13. During all this time Philip had met with strange
adventures. The day he went to the Point he had to
wait for corn to be ground, which made him late in
starting for home. He heard a good many reports concerning the Indians, and thought that it would be safer to
take a roundabout course back; by doing this he lost his
way and wandered in the woods till almost twelve o'clock
at night, when he came out upon a cleared place where
there were several log huts.
The people in one of these let him come in and sleep
on the floor, and they gave him a good meal of meat and
potatoes. He set out again between four and five in the
morning, guided by a row of stars that those. people
pointed out to him.-"a 87 8'14. A little after daybreak, being then about
quarter of a mile from home in a hilly place, he thought
he would leave his sled, the load was so hard to draw,
and run ahead and tell the folks about the Indians. So
he pushed it under some bushes, and then, to mark the
spot, he took one of his shoestrings and tied one of his
mittens high up on the limb of a tree.
He heard strange sounds and climbed up into a hemlock
tree which overhung a brook to hide out of sight and
to look about. He lay along a branch listening, and
presently saw Nathaniel hurrying toward the brook, leading little Polly, and was just going to call out when he
caught sight of three Indians standing behind some trees,
watching the two children.
15. Philip moved a little to see better, and by doing
this lost sight of them a moment, and when he looked
again they were both gone. He heard a crackling in the
bushes, and caught sight of little Polly's blanket flying
through the woods, and knew then that those Indians
had carried off Nathaniel and little Polly.  Without
stopping to consider, he jumped down and followed on,
thinking to find out where they went and tell his father.
Philip, by one way or another, kept on the trail
of the Indians the whole day. Once it was by seeing
a shred of a blanket. Another time it was by coming
across a knife the Indians had stolen from some house.-..8 Ss88.-..i he had wit enough to break a limb or gash a tree
now and then so as to find his way back; also to take the
bearings of the hills. When the Indians halted to rest
he had a chance to rest too.
16. At last they stopped for the night in a valley
where there were two or three wigwams. He watched
them go into one of these, and then he could not think
what to do next. The night was setting in bitter cold.
The shoe he took the string from had come off in running, and that foot was nearly frozen, and would have been
quite, only for his having tied some moss to the bottom of
it with his pocket handkerchief. The hand that had no
mitten was frozen. He had eaten nothing but boxberry
plums and boxberry leaves.
He lay down on the snow. Then he began to feel
sleepy, and knew nothing more till he woke inside of
a wigwam, and found two Indian women rubbing him
with snow. He did not see Nathaniel and little Polly.
They were in another wigwam. There were two Indians
squatting on -the floor, one of them quite old.
Philip suffered dreadful pain in his foot and hand, but
he shut his mouth tight for fear he might groan. He
said afterward, when questioned about this part of his
story, that he was not going to let them hear a white boy
groan.
17. It was probably seeing him so courageous that--  89 Gigave them the idea of offering him to their chief's;.
It was a custom among them, when a chief's wife lost a
male child by death, to offer her another, usually a captive
taken in war. If, after seeing the child offered in this
way, she refused to adopt him, he was not suffered to
live.
Now one of those two squaws in the wigwam felt
inclined to keep Philip from being carried to where the
chief lived; so next morning before light, when the
Indians went off hunting, she sent the other squaw out
on some errand, and then told Philip in broken English
that he must run away that very morning. She bound
up his foot, gave him a moccasin to wear on it, a bag of
pounded corn, and a few strips of meat.
18. As soon as it began to grow light he went along
without much trouble by means of the signs on the trees.
But as he got farther on, there being fewer of these
signs, he took the wrong course,- very luckily as it
proved, for by doing so he fell in with two men on horseback, and one of these carried him home.
Philip described the place where the Indians were
encamped, and that very night a party was sent out
which captured the Indians and brought back Nathaniel
and little Polly.-06 909.THE FATE OF THE INDIANS.
BY CHARLES SPRAGUE.
CHARLES SPRAGUE was born in Boston in 1791. Although he
was employed for nearly forty years as cashier in a bank, he spent
much time in writing.
He was a great favorite as an orator. His speeches were marked
by strength and a brilliant style.
He was a large-hearted man, and the fate of the Indian race
aroused his sympathy. He felt that they had been wronged by
the white men.
The following selection is taken from a speech which he delivered
at Boston on the Fourth of July, 1825.

1. NOT many generations ago, where you now sit encircled by all that exalts and embellishes civilized life, the
rank thistle nodded in the wind and the wild fox dug
his hole unscared.
Here lived and loved another race of beings. Beneath
the same sun that rolls over our heads the Indian hunter
pursued the panting deer; gazing on the same moon that
smiles for you, the Indian lover wooed his dusky mate.
Here the wigwam blaze beamed on the tender and the
helpless, the council fire glared on the wise and the
daring.-' 91 8--
2. Now they dipped their noble limbs in your sedgy
lakes, and now they paddled the light canoe along your
rocky shores. Here they warred; the echoing whoop, the
defying death song, both were here; and when the tiger
strife was over, here curled the smoke of peace.
Here, too, they worshipped; and from many a dark
bosom went up a pure prayer to the Great Spirit. He
had not written his laws for them on tables of stone, but
he had- traced them on the tables of their hearts. The
poor child of nature knew not the God of Revelation, but
the God of the universe he acknowledged in everything
around.
3. He beheld Him in the star that sank in beauty
behind his lowly dwelling; in the sacred orb that flamed
on him from his midday throne; in the flower that
snapped in the morning breeze; in the lofty pine that
had defied a thousand whirlwinds; in the fearless eagle
whose untired pinion was wet in clouds.
And all this has passed away. Across the ocean came
a Pilgrim bark, bearing the seeds of life and death. The
former were sown for you, the latter sprang up in the
path of the simple native.
4. Two hundred years have changed the character of
a great continent, and blotted forever from its face a
whole, peculiar people.
The Indian of falcon glance and lion bearing, the hero-8 92 8of the pathetic tale, is gone! And his degraded offspring
crawl upon the soil, where he walked in majesty, to
remind us how miserable is man when the foot of the
conqueror is on his neck.
5. As a race, they have withered from  the land.
Their arrows are broken, their springs have dried up,
their cabins are in the dust. Their council fire has long
since gone out on the shore, and their war cry is fast
dying away to the untrodden west.  Slowly and sadly
they climb the distant mountains and read their doom
in the setting sun.
They are shrinking before the mighty tide which is
pressing them away; they must soon hear the roar of
the last wave which will settle over them forever.

1. THERE once lived in England a little boy whose
name was Charles Dickens. He was born at Portsmouth,
on the 7th of February, 1812, his father being a clerk in
the Navy Pay Office at that place. Mr. Dickens lost this--O 93  8-c
CHARLES DiCKENS
position and the family moved to Chatham when Charles
was four years old.
Charles' first teacher was his mother, who taught him
to read. When he was seven years old he attended a
day school, and the master soon saw that his little pupil
was very clever. The boy was not well and strong, so
he could not join his playmates in their games of ball
and cricket; but he would lie on the grass for hours
watching them with great interest.
2. He was soon reading the best authors. Often when
suffering from pain he turned to books for comfort, and
the people of whom he read became real friends. His
father had some books which he kept in an empty room,LITERATURE in its noblest form should do for the child
what it does for the man, --open the eyes to clearer vision,
and nourish and inspire the soul.
The reading book, therefore, has more direct influence
upon the character of the pupil than any other text-book,
and, with this in mind, it has been the fundamental purpose
of this series to make its readers familiar with the best writers
and their works.
It has been deemed best to continue the plan of the previous
books of the series and introduce several central figures.  We
have been reading and becoming acquainted with the American
poets; now we enter a new field of literature, and the great
prose writers, Hawthorne, Irving, Dickens, and Scott, with the
English poet Tennyson, shed the influence of their characters
and writings in the schoolroom.
The pupil looks into their faces and visits their homes.
Their early childhood, their battles with adversity, and the
influences that determined the current of their lives become
familiar.  Then, with awakened interest and admiration, he
reads the messages they have left behind them.
Characteristic selections from these authors have been carefully chosen with reference to the capacity of the children.-7 94 BO-  
where Charles spent many an hour, and he would imagine for weeks at a time that he was some character in
them. He said: "Robinson Crusoe and others came out,
a glorious host, to keep me company."
In spite of his ill health Charles was a light-hearted,
merry little fellow, full of fun and very fond of singing.
His sister Fannie was musical, and she and Charles sang
together. When he became a man he amused his friends
and his children with these funny songs.
3. It was fortunate that he had this happy nature, for
it helped him through the dark days that came to him
early in life. Soon after he was nine years old his father
had to leave Chatham and moved to London. Charles
was sorry to leave the place which was so dear to him.
No more sailing trips with his father, no more happy
days with his schoolmates.
The night before he went away his schoolmaster came
in and gave him a book, " The Bee," by Oliver Goldsmith.
The boy prized this very highly and kept it many years.
His father had lost money and the new home was in a
poor part of London. Charles could find no companions
there, and he used often to sit in his little garret room
and long for the home at Chatham with its woods and
fields, and for his schoolmates. He had no companions
of his own age, for there was no school for him to attend,
and his sister Fannie was away studying music.-  9 5 84. Darker days yet were before him. His father lost
what little he had, and Charles went to work in a blacking factory. No more schooling for him now; he must
bravely do his part and earn his own living. He was
paid six shillings a week and felt very proud as he carried them home, gazing in at the shop windows and
thinking of what his six shillings would buy.
Mr. Dickens, being unable to pay his debts, was sent
to the debtor's prison soon after little Charles went to
work. The boy now gave up all hope of ever going
to school. Sadly, but bravely, he bade farewell' to the
hope of doing and being something in this world. He
was alone and must struggle along by himself.
5. Mrs. Dickens and the other children went to the
prison to live; but Charles was sent to lodge with an old
lady in Camden Town. Every Sunday he used to walk
to the prison, where he spent the day with the family.
The poor boy was so lonely that he finally begged his
father to let him hire a room near the prison where he
might see the family more often. His father consented
and Charles found a little attic room near by.
Two years slowly passed by while the boy worked
nobly in the smoky old factory. He was often too ill to
do his work well, and the days were long and dreary.
He tried to study by himself, for he was not willing
to grow up in ignorance, but was too tired after his day'swork to accomplish much.  These years of suffering
made his heart very tender toward children who were
alone in the world or oppressed in any way, and his
beautiful nature was not harmed by his low surroundings.
6. But brighter days were at hand. His father had
some money left to him, and was able to pay his debts
and make a home for his family.
It was a happy day when little Charles said good-bye
to the factory and went home again. He was able to
attend school once more, and soon became a leader in all
boyish sports.
His health improved, and at twelve years of age he
was a bright, handsome boy, full of fun, but always kind
and thoughtful of others. His books were dearer than
ever to him, and his favorite motto was, "What is worth
doing at all is worth doing well."
His schoolmates soon discovered his talent for storytelling, and would listen with interest to his tales of
adventure, and he and several of his friends published a
little paper.
7. After his school course was over, his father wished
him to study law, and he became a clerk in a lawyer's
office. He held the position for over a year, then decided
to be a reporter. He spent some time working at the
study of shorthand, studying at the same time at the--697 84reading room of the British Museum. In his eighteenth
year he entered the Hlouse of Commons as reporter.
He also found time to write for a mnagazine. These
sketches were full of wit and humor, and the style was
so new that they soon made the author famous. He
DIC-E- IS  HO~... E- AT G;D`!- E  TG 4-- HLL
DICKENS$ HOME4 AT GADSHILL,  
signed them  "Boz," a nickname which he had given in
sport to his youngest brother.
S. In 1836 Dickens publislhed  Sketches by Boz" and
"The Pickwick Papers."  These placed him at once in
the highest rank of English authors. Many other books
followed, and his writing increased in popularity. He-98 Oa 9.was always hard at work, and lived in the book he was
writing, suffering or rejoicing with his characters.
He was married in 1836, the year his first books were
published, and his home was soon made glad with the
sound of childish voices. How dear to the great man
were these little ones, and what a gentle, loving father
they had! He had never shut his heart against suffering,
and was full of sympathy for every childish sorrow.
9. When he was a very small boy and lived in Chatham,
he used once in a while to walk by a large old-fashioned
house on the top of a hill called "Gadshill."  He had
a great liking for this house, perhaps because of two fine
cedars that grew near it.
His father used to tell him that if he worked hard he
might live there when he was a man. After he became
successful he bought this very house and spent many
happy years in it. In this beautiful home he received
his friends.
10. He had a little chalet or summer-house where he
wrote.  He says of it: "My room  is up among the
branches of the trees; and the birds and the butterflies
fly in and out, and the green branches shoot in at the
open windows, and the light and shadows of the clouds
come and go with the rest of the company."
Many of his stories were played on the stage, and he
gave readings from his own books. There was a wonder-.. 99 9.ful charm in his voice and expression, and his hearers
were,moved to tears or laughter by the magic of his
tones.
He made two visits to this country, where he met with
the heartiest reception.
11. Dickens died on the 9th of June, 1870, in his home
at Gadshill, and lies buried among England's honored
dead in Westminster Abbey.
Wreaths of flowers are placed by his fond admirers
many times every year upon the stone that marks his
burial place in the old Abbey.
DICKENS' GRAVE IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.-'  100 8.THE DOLLS' DRESSMAKER.
BY CHARLES DICKENS.
THIS is a brief extract from " Our Mutual Friend." This novel
is not especially interesting to boys and girls save those parts of it
which pertain to Jenny Wren, the dolls' dressmaker. Jenny is one
of the quaintest and oddest creations of this masterly writer who
has delineated so many lovable characters which appeal to the
hearts of young people.
This extract has been compiled from Book II, Chapter I, of the
novel.
More extended selections from this chapter and from several
other chapters which describe Jenny Wren and her friends should
be arranged by the teacher for the pupils, as time may permit.

1. BRADLEY HEADSTONE and Charley Hexam crossed
the bridge and made along the shore toward Millbank.
At the point where Church Street and Smith Square
joined, there were some little quiet houses in a row.
At one of these they stopped.
The boy knocked at a door, and the door promptly
opened with a spring and a click, and disclosed a child -
a dwarf, a girl - sitting in a low, old-fashioned armchair
which had a kind of a little working bench before it.
"I can't get up," said the child, "because my back-.8 1 0 1 9cis bad and my legs are queer. But I'm the person of
the house. What did you want, young man?"
"I wanted to see my sister."
"Many young men have sisters," returned the child.
"Give me your name, young man."
2. The queer little figure and the queer little face,
with its bright gray eyes, were so sharp that the sharpness of manner seemed unavoidable; as if, turned out of
that mould, it must be sharp.
"Hexam is my name."
"Ah, indeed?" said the person of the house. "I
thought it might be. Your sister will be in in about a
quarter of an hour. I am very fond of your sister. She's
my particular friend. And this gentleman's name?"' Mr. Headstone, my schoolmaster."
"Take a seat. And would you please to shut the
street door first? I can't very well do it myself."
3. They complied in silence. The little figure went
on with its work of gluing together certain pieces of cardboard and thin wood, previously cut into various shapes.
The scissors and knives upon the bench showed that the
child herself had cut them. The bright scraps of velvet
and silk and ribbon also strewn upon the bench showed
that, when duly stuffed, she was to cover them smartly.
4. The dexterity of her nimble fingers was remarkable. As she brought- two thin edges accurately together-  102 &amp;by giving them  a little bite, she would glance at her
visitors out of the corners of her gray eyes with a look
that outsharpened all her other sharpness.
"'You can't tell me the name of my trade, I'll be
bound," she said, after taking several of these observations.'" You make pincushions," said Charley.
"What else do I make?"' Penwipers," said Bradley Headstone.
"Ha! ha!  What else do I make? You're a schoolmaster, but you can't tell me."
5. "You do something with straw," he returned,
pointing to a corner of the little bench, "but I don't
know what."-40 103 84"Well done. I only make pincushions and penwipers
to use up my waste. But my straw really does belong to
my business. Try again. What do I make with my straw?"
"Ladies' bonnets?"
" Fine ladies'," said the person of the house.  "Dolls'
--I'm a dolls' dressmaker."
" I hope it's a good business?"
6. The person of the house shrugged her shoulders
and shook her head.
"No. Poorly paid. And I'm  often so pressed for
time. I had a doll married last week and was obliged
to work all night."
They looked at the little creature with a wonder that
did not diminish, and the schoolmaster said, "I'm sorry
your fine ladies are so inconsiderate."
"It's the way with them," said the person of the
house, shrugging her shoulders again. "' And they take
no care of their clothes, and they never keep to the same
fashions a month. I work for a doll with three daughters. Bless you, she's enough to ruin her husband!"
7. She gave a weird little laugh here, and another
look out of the corners of her eyes.
"Are you always as busy as you are now?"
"Busier. I'm  slack just now.  I finished a large
mourning order the day before yesterday. Doll I'wQrk
for lost a canary bird."-48 vi 8C..
These selections have been somewhat abridged, but it has
been thought wiser to have them a little longer than many
text-books introduce, rather than to mar the symmetry and
beauty of the author's work.
Here are also represented the more recent writers who have
won a place in the literary world, thus making this reading
book the foundation for a systematic study of literature.
In order'to cherish the true American spirit, speeches of
some of our great statesmen and stories of loyalty and heroism
have been introduced. There are tales of travel and adventure
to broaden the mental horizon, and the imagination finds food
for fancies in many of the prose selections as well as in
the poems.
Grateful acknowledgment for copyright matter is extended
to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co. for the use of extracts
from the writings of Hawthorne, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps,
and Charles Dudley Warner; to Charles Scribner's Sons
for the selections from Eugene Field, Thomas Nelson Page,

ELLEN M. CYR.-a8 1049.."Are you alone all day?" asked Bradley Headstone.
"Don't any of the neighlboring children -? "
8. "Don't talk of children! " cried the person of the
house with a little scream, as if the word had -pricked
her.
"I can't bear children. I know their tricks and their
manners. Always running about and screeching, always
playing and fighting, always skip, skip, skipping on the
pavement and chalking it for their games.
"And that's not all. Ever so often calling names in
through a person's keyhole and imitating a person's
back and legs. No, no, no! No children for me. Give
me grown-ups."
9. It was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature, for her poor figure furnished no clew to it, and her
face was at once so young and so old. Twelve, or at the
most thirteen, might be near the mark.
"I always did like grown-ups," she went on, "and
always kept company with them. So sensible. Sit so
quiet. Don't go prancing and capering about."
She listened to a step outside that caught her ear, and
there -vas a soft knock at the door. Pulling at a handle
within her reach, she said, with a pleased laugh, "Now,
here is a grown-up that's my particular friend!" and
Lizzie- Hexam entered the room.
"Charley! You?"10. Taking her brother to her arms in the old wayof which he seemed a little ashamed  she saw no one
else.
"There, there, there!  All right, my dear.  See!
Here's Mr. Headstone come with me."
Her eyes met those of the schoolmaster, and a murmured wordc of salutation passed between them....
After their departure Mr. Eugene Wrayburn called.
11. He fell to talking playfully to Jenny Wren. "I
think of setting up a doll, Miss Jenny," he said.
"You had better not," replied the dressmaker.
"Why not?"
"You are sure to break it. All you children do."
"But that makes it good for trade, you know, MisN?
Wren."
" I don't know about that," Miss Wren retorted; "but
you had better by half set up a penwiper and turn
industrious and use it."
"If we all set to work as soon as we could use our
hands it would be all over with the dolls' dressmakers."
"There's something in that," replied Miss Wren.
"You. have a sort of an idea in your noddle sometimes."
Then in a changed tone, "Talking of ideas, Lizzie, I wonder how it happens that when I am work, work, working
here all alone in the summer time I smell flowers.""As a commonplace individual, I should say," suggested the schoolmaster, " that you smell flowers because
youi do smell flowers."
12. "No, I don't," said the little creature, resting one
arm, upon the elbow of her chair, resting her chin upon
that hand, and looking vacantly before her; "this is not
a flowery neighborhood. It's anything but that. And
yet, as I sit at work, I smell miles of flowers. I smell
roses till I think I see the rose leaves lying in heaps,
bushels, upon the floor.
"I smell fallen leaves till I put down my hand- so -
and expect to make them rustle. I smell the white and
the pink May in the hedges, and all sorts of flowers that
I never was among, for I have seen very few flowers
indeed in my life."
"Pleasant fancies to have, Jenny dear!" said her
friend.
13. "So I think, Lizzie, when they come to me, and
the birds I hear! Oh!" cried the little creature, holding
out her hand and looking upward, 1" how they sing! "
There was something in the face and action for the
moment quite inspired and beautiful.  Then the chin
dropped mulsingly upon the hand again.
"I dare say my birds sing better than other birds and
my flowers smell better than other flowers; for when I
was a little child," in a tone as if it were ages ago, "the-4 107 9.children that I used to see early in the morning were
very different from any others that I ever saw. They
were not like me; they were never in pain.
"'They were not like the children of the neighbors;
they never made me tremble all over by setting up shrill
noises, and they never mocked me. Such numbers of
them, too!  All in white dresses and with something
shining on the borders and on their heads that I have
never been able to imitate with my work, though I know
it so well.
14. "They used to come down in long, bright, slanting
rows, and say all together:' Who is this in pain? Who
is this in pain?' When I told them who I was, they
answered,'Come play with us!' When I said,'I never
play! I can't play!' they swept about me and took me
up and made me light.
"Then it was all delicious ease and rest till they laid
me down and said, all together:'Have patience, and we
will come again.'
"Whenever they caine back, I used to know they
were coming before I saw the long, bright rows by hearing them ask, all together, a long way off:'Who is this
in pain? Who is this in pain?' And I used to crz out:' O my blessed children, it's poor me. Have pity on me.
Take me up and make me light.' "

A STORY OF THE FLAG.

1. I DO not know how you feel about the American
flag, but it has often occurred to me that most of us have
very little feeling about it.
I do not mean by this that we are not patriotic - that
we would not march up to the cannon's mouth, if we were
called upon to do so, as quickly as the Englishman, the
German, or anybody else. But our country is so peaceful,
and we see so many flags drooping so lazily from flagpoles
on the tops of big buildings, or carried on picnic parades,
or stuck in the collars of horses, that we are very apt to
pass by a flag without noticing it.-'8 I09 8'.If it does chance to engage our attention, we remark,
perhaps, that it is faded or bright, large or small, of silk
or bunting, or something of the sort, and that is as much
feeling as the sight of it ever inspires.
2. At any rate that is what a little boy I know thought
about it when he went abroad with me last May. But
two little adventures this boy took part in, some time
after he arrived on the other side of the ocean, have
changed this feeling somewhat. These two adventures
that Frank, the little boy I speak of, had in Paris were,
perhaps, worth while telling about.
When the Fourth of July came, we had been in Paris
nearly two months, and during that time I think we had
not seen a single American flag.
3. On the morning of the Fourth, however, we walked
out on the boulevard, and a number of flags were hanging
out from the American shops. They looked strange to
us, and the idea came to Frank, for the first time, that
the United States was one of a great many nations living
next to one another in this world  that it was his own
nation, a kind of big family to which he belonged. The
Fourth of July was a sort of a big family birthday, and
the -flags were out to tell the Frenchmen and everybody
not to forget the fact.
4. A feeling of this nature came over Frank that
morning, and he called out "There's another! " every-48 1 1 0 Btime a new flag came in view. He stopped two or three
times to count the number in sight, and showed in various
ways that he, America, and the American flag had come
to a new relation.
During the morning Frank's cousin George, a boy two
or three years older than he, came to our hotel, and they
went off together to see the sights and have a good time.
When Frank returned and came up to the room where
I was writing, I noticed a small American flag pin stuck
into the lapel of his coat.
5. "George had two," he said in answer to my question, " and he gave me this one. He's been in Paris a year
now, and he says we ought to wear them so people may
know that we are Americans.  But say, Uncle Jack,
where do you think I got that?"  He opened a paper
bundle he had under his arm and unrolled a weatherbeaten American flag.
"Where?" asked I, supposing it had come from
George's house.
" We took it off Lafayette's tomb."
I opened my eyes in astonishment, while he went on:
6. "George says the American Consul put it on the
tomb last Fourth of July for our' government, beckuse
Lafayette helped us in the Revolution.
" They ought to put on a new flag every year, George
says," explained Frank, seeing my amazement, "on Fourthof July morning, but the American Consul is a new man,
George thinks, for he forgot to do it.  So we bought
a new flag and we did it. We went to a store on the
boulevard, and for twenty francs bought a new flag just
like the old one. George and I each paid half.
"There were two women and a little girl at the tomb
when we returned, and we waited till they went away.
Then we unrolled the new flag and took the old one off
the tomb.
7. "We thought we ought to say something when we
put the new flag on, but we did n't know what to say.
George said they always made a regular speech, thanking
Lafayette for helping us in the Revolution, but we thought
it didn't matter much. So we just took off our hats
when we spread the new flag on the grave, and then we
rolled up the old flag and came away.
"We drew lots for it afterward, and I am going to
take it home with me.'f Somebody ought to have done it, and as we were both
American boys, it was all right, was n't it?"
Right or wrong, the flag that travelers saw on Lafayette's tomb that year as a mark of the American nation's
respect for that great Frenchman was the one put there
by two boys. And the flag put there the year before,
Frank has carefully hung on the wall of his little room
in America.-..3 112  948. Ten days after this adventure came the Fourteenth
of July,- the great day on which the French people
stormed the grim old Bastille and cried: "Down with
the tyranny of kings!"
It is much the same sort of day to the French as our
Fourth of July is to us, only they show a great deal more
enthusiasm. The little French boys do not shoot off fire
crackers all day in the streets, to frighten horses, scorch
their fingers, and make mothers anxious.
There is a great military parade reviewed by the
President, there are bands of music on the corners and
public places throughout Paris; and at night, while
fireworks are being set off, men, women, and children
throng the streets and dance and sing till daylight is
about ready to share the fun.
9. The morning of that great day George came round
to the hotel, and I asked the two boys if they would like
to go after lunch to see the great military parade, where
President Carnot was going to have some thirty thousand
French soldiers march by his stand and salute him.
George thought it would be more fun to take a carriage
and drive about Paris to see all the people celebrating.
It would be hot and crowded at the review and we
could not hope to see President Carnot, so Frank and
I agreed with George.
10. Before we started out, Frank suggested that we-Ord  113 8should buy two big flags, the same size, one American,
red, white, and blue, and the other French, red, white,
and blue, and take them with us. "Don't you see," he
explained, "we will carry the American flag to show that
we are Americans, and the French flag will show that
we're glad they are celebrating!"
So they bought the two flags,- fine large ones,- and
Frank with the American flag sat with the coachman on
the box, while George and I put the French flag between
us, to fly out behind.
11. After driving about from place to place, we found
ourselves once more back on the boulevards, when suddenly Frank gave a shout.
"Look! " he called out, " there come some soldiers! "
Yes, there were soldiers on horseback coming towards
us. Then far-away shouts reached our ears from the
crowds ahead, where the soldiers were.
"Look at the pistols," cried Frank from the box.
"They are holding them right up in the air. What is
that for?"
"They are a bodyguard," George said. "It must be
somebody."
"It is the President," said the coachman, as the soldiers
came toward us at a rapid pace.
12. We were within fifty yards of them now and could
see everything.  There in front were the two officers,THE MAPLE-TREE'S CHILDREN. Abby Morton DiaPAGE

Behind came the President's carriage drawn by four

FRANK SALUTES THE FRENCH PRESIDENT.
The people were shouting and cheering on all sides,
"Le President!"  " Carnot!"
He was almost abreast of us and close by when suddenly I noticed he was looking in our direction, and
all eyes were turned toward our carriage.
It was the American flag!-"a 115 8CThere it was floating proudly aloft in the hands of our
little boy in the front seat.
13. When Frank saw the President abreast of him
and everybody looking at his flag, without a sign of
hesitation he stood straight, held the flag as high as
he could, and dipped a salute to the President of the
French Republic!
The crowd cheered wildly. President Carnot moved
forward in his seat, lifted his hat, and bowed low to
Frank and the American flag.
And then in a second he had passed.
14. This flag, I think, is prized by Frank even more
than the other, for whenever he takes anybody to his
room, he always says first, " This is the flag that was on
Lafayette's tomb; and then, in a more impressive voice,
"That is the one President Carnot took off his hat to."
But these two flags are not the only ones that are dear
to him.  Every flag he sees on the street he realizes
might have been on Lafayette's tomb or saluted by
President Carnot.-t 116 Sq.A WELCOME TO LAFAYETTE.
BY EDWARD EVERETT.
DURING the visit of Lafayette the corner-stone of the monument
was laid at Bunker Hill, the scene of one of the first and most
celebrated battles of the Revolutionary War, fought June 17,
1775. This is a brief extract from an oration delivered by Mr.
Everett at Cambridge in 1824.
1. WITH the present year will be completed the halfcentury from that most important era in human history,
the commencement of our Revolutionary War.
A few still survive among us to reap the rich fruits
of their labors and suffering, and one has yielded himself
to the united voice of a people, and returned in his age
to. receive the gratitude of the nation to whom he devoted
his youth.
2. It is recorded on the pages of American history
that when this friend of our country applied to our commissioners at Paris, in 1776, for a passage to America,
they were obliged to answer him that they possessed
not the means nor the credit for providing a single
vessel in all the ports of France.
"Then," exclaimed the youthful hero, "I will provide
my own"; and it is a literal fact that when all America
was too poor to offer him so much as a passage to our-08 117-9.shores, he left, in his tender youth, the bosom of home,
of happiness, of wealth, of rank, to plunge in the dust
and blood of our struggle.
3. Welcome, friend of our fathers, to our shores!
Happy are our eyes that behold those venerable features.
Enjoy a triumph such as never monarch enjoyed,--the
assurance that throughout America there is not a bosom
which does not beat with joy and gratitude at your name.
Welcome, thrice welcome, to our shores; and whithersoever throughout the limits of the continent your course
shall take you, the ear that hears you shall bless you,
the eye that sees you shall bear witness to you, and
every tongue exclaim, with heartfelt joy, "Welcome,
welcome, Lafayette!"
THE NATIONAL FLAG.
BY CHARLES SUMNER.
CHARLES SUMNER was one of our most prominent American
statesmen. He was born in Boston, Mass., January, 1811, was
graduated at Harvard, and then studied and practised law.
In 1845 he delivered the Fourth of July oration at Boston with
so much eloquence and force that he gained high rank as an orator.
Five years later he was elected to the United States Senate, and
held.that position until his death, in 1873.
Although there were many who disagreed with his views, they
never questioned his honor and integrity. His speeches werefinished and scholarly, and always impressed his audience with
his power and sincerity. He was a great and good man, and
gained the respect of the whole country.
1. THERE is the national flag!  He must be cold
indeed who can look upon its folds rippling in the
breeze without pride of country. If he be in a foreign
land, the flag is companionship and country itself with
all its endearments.
Who, as he sees it, can think of a state merely?
Whose eyes, once fastened upon its radiant trophies, can
fail to recognize the image of the whole nation?
It has been called a floating piece of poetry, and yet
I know not if it have an intrinsic beauty beyond other
ensigns.  Its highest beauty is in what it symbolizes.
It is because it represents all that all gaze at it with
delight and reverence.
2. It is a piece of bunting lifted in the air, but it- 119 9speaks sublimely, and every part has a voice. Its stripes
of alternate red and white proclaim the original union of
thirteen states to maintain the Declaration of Independence. Its stars of white on a field of blue proclaim that
union of states constituting our national constellation,
which receives a new star with every new state.
The two together signify union, past and present.
The very colors have a language which was officially
recognized by our fathers.  White is for purity, red for
valor, blue for justice; and all together, bunting, stripes,
stars, and colors blazing in the sky, make the flag of our
country -to be cherished by all our hearts, to be upheld
by all our hands.
Bright flag at yonder tapering mast,
Fling out your field of azure blue;
Let star and stripe be westward cast,
And point as Freedom's eagle flew!
Strain home! O lithe and quivering spars!
Point home, my count$y's flag of stars!

1. ALFRED TENNYSON was born in Somersby, England,
on the sixth day of August, 1809. His father was the
village rector, and there, in the white rectory house among
the hills and beneath leafy elims, came the tiny babe who
was destined to become the greatest poet of his age.
His mother was a gentle lady with a lively imagination,
so kind-hearted that the bad boys of the village used
sometimes to beat their dogs under her window in order
to be bribed to leave off.
2. There were twelve children in the Tennyson family,
and they lived in a little world of their own. The seven-.*  121  8'boys would play that they were knights defending a
castle or rescuing maidens. Sometimes they fought mimic
battles, dividing themselves into two camps, each having
a willow wand set up in its midst for a king.  Each
party tried to overthrow the other's king with a stone.
The love of beauty was very strong in them, and they
told marvelous tales and fancied themselves the knights
and heroes of which they read.
They liked to write about their play, and used to put
the histories of their battles under the potato bowl on the
dinner table so that their father might read them. They
were a very happy family, and the poems in which
Tennyson refers to early days are full of warmth and
tenderness.
But it was not all playtime. The children were taught
at home and in the village school. The books surrounding them in the rector's library and the pleasant home
instruction awakened an early fondness for learning.
3. Alfred showed thought beyond his years when
very young. When he was five years of age, as the wind
swept through the garden of the rectory, he spread out
his little arms and was blown along by it, crying in great
glee, "'I hear a voice that's speaking in the wind," and
the voices which spoke in the babbling of the brook, the
sighing of the pines, and the murmur of the waves soon
shaped themselves into verse.-) 122  94tAlfred always loved the sea. He heard many voices in
its varying sounds, and the music of the restless waves
awakened an answering echo in the heart of the young
poet. He once ran bareheaded to the shore to listen to
the moaning music of the sea.
4. Charles Tennyson, next older than Alfred, was his
constant companion. He, too, had poetical tastes, and
wrote throughout his life; but his genius was less than
his brother's.  The two boys were sent to the Louth
Grammar School for a short time, but returned to
Somersby and attended a school called "Cadney's."
During their course there they wrote verses.
In 1827 they carried their work to a publisher, who
gave them twenty pounds for it and published it under,
the title of " Poems by Two Brothers."  The critics paid
little attention to this work, and its sale was confined to
the family friends. The world little dreamed that a great
poet was springing up in its midst.
5. The following year Charles and Alfred went to
Trinity College, Cambridge.  Their older brother had
spent two years there, and had taken the college prize
for the Greek poem. This life was a great change from
the sleepy village of Somersby, and the influence of the
strong, thoughtful minds gathered there was of great
benefit to Tennyson.
At that time there were a number of young men at-4 123 3STENNYSON IN HIS LIBRARY,
Trinity who had unusual talent.  The Tennyson boys
found friends of their own age who had the same tastes,
and they used to meet and tell stories and talk and plan
for the future. Those college days were full of delight
and profit.
6. It was here that Alfred Tennyson met Arthur Hallamn, a young man of rare sweetness of character, who
gave promise of great genius. Hallam and Tennyson
were soon drawn to each other in a friendship closer than
that of the two brothers.
Both young men wrote: and Tennyson afterward said,
H' He still outstripped me in the race."-&amp; viii.INCIDENT OF THE FRENCH CAMP. Robert Browning... 180

for a poem on Timbuctoo. This poem received praise
from the critics, who said that it would have done honor
to any man that ever wrote. In 1830 Tennyson published
a little book of verses, which was most favorably received
by some critics and ridiculed by others.
A great sorrow was hanging over the young poet.
Arthur Hallam, who became dearer with every passing
year, died suddenly while at Vienna.
"God's finger touched him, and he slept."
7. The loss of this very dear friend stirred the young
poet's soul to its inmost depths and turned his'thoughts
to the mysteries of life and death. For seventeen years
he secretly relieved the burden of his grieving heart in a
memorial poem; but his cry of sorrow and despair grew
more confident in the later years, and the closing verses
expressed the confidence that the God of love made life
and death and is King of both.
Meanwhile he was writing other poems, and his work
was becoming better known. The volume published in
1842 took the world by storm.. These later poems showed
a rare skill in poetic expression and melody. They were
full of pictures of English scenery, - the castles and
baronial halls, the homesteads and well-kept gardens,
the glorious summer woods and the ever-changing sea.-M-8 125 91.But beyond all these pictures and delicate fancies were
spiritual feeling, heart throbs of emotion, and purity of
thought.
Charles Dickens was one of the first to recognize
Tennyson's genius. He was always a great admirer of
the poet, and writes, "Tennyson I have been reading
again and again. What a great creature he is! "
8. In 1]850 Tennyson gave to the world "In Memoriam," his lament for Arthur Hallam. These verses
placed him at the head of all poets of his time, and he
was made poet laureate. That was also the year of his
marriage to Emily Sellwood. They had long been engaged, and it was her faithful love that had brought
gladness into his life.
Two sons, Hallam and Lionel, were born at the beautiful
home at Farringford.  The house there is delightfully
situated. Its park, grove, and pastures are fresh and
green, and stately trees grow all about the house.
In the midst of all this beauty and comfort lived
Tennyson, grand and noble, but always sad and gloomy.
He lived a very quiet life, spending his time in writing. His pen was never idle, and his last poems were as
beautiful and full of melody as any that he ever wrote.
9.  His most famous poems are, c"Maud," " The
Princess," and "Idyls of the King," although some of
his shorter poems sing themselves into many hearts.-,r 126 SoHis poems are high and noble and full of truth as well
as beautiful visions.  No blot, no stain mars their beauty.
His verse is the most faultless in our language, both as
regards the music of its flow and the art displayed in the
choice of words. As a word-painter no modern poet has
equaled him.
His language, although consisting for the most part of
strong and pithy Saxon words, is yet the very perfection
of all that is elegant and musical in the art of versification.
The great Poet's faith grew brighter and more hopeful
during the last years of his life, and when he died in
1892 and was laid with kings and queens in Westminster
Abbey his own words came to many a sorrowing heart:
"Come away; for Life and Thought
Here no longer dwell;
But in a city glorious,A great and distant city, -have bought
A mansion incorruptible.
Would they could have stayed with us!"--H 127 8.SIR GALAHAD.
BY ALFRED TENNYSON.
SIR GALAHAD was a knight who was seeking for the Holy Grail,
-the cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper.
A knight who undertook this pilgrimage must be pure in
thought, word, and deed.
MY good blade carves the casques of men,
My tough lance thrusteth sure,
My strength is as the strength of ten,
Because my heart is pure.
The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,
The hard brands shiver on the steel,
The splintered spear-shafts crack and fly,
The horse and rider reel;
They reel, they roll in clanging lists,
And when the tide of combat stands,
Perfume and flowers fall in showers,
That lightly rain from ladies' hands.
When on my goodly charger borne,
Through dreaming towns I go,
The cock crows ere the Christmas morn,
The streets are dumb with snow.-     1 28 8'The tempest crackles on the leads,
And, ringing, spins from brand and mail;
But o'er the dark a glory spreads,
And gilds the driving hail--
I leave the plain, I climb the height;
No branchy thicket shelter yields;
But blessed forms in whistling storms
Fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.
The clouds are broken in the sky,
And through the mountain-walls
A rolling organ-harmony
Swells up, and shakes and falls.
Then move the trees, the copses nod,
Wings flutter, voices hover clear:
" O just and faithful knight of God!
Ride on! the prize is near."
So pass I hostel, hall, and grange;
By bridge and ford, by park and pale,
All-armed I ride, what e'er betide,
Until I find the Holy Grail.-43 129 E.LITTLE ROSALIE.
(Abridged.)
BY HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD.
PART I.
MRS. SPOFFORD was born at Calais, Me., but she has spent the
greater part of her life in the old town of Newburyport, Mass.
She now lives near this quaint city, in a delightful home, on the
banks of the Merrimac River.
She began writing when quite young, and her story "'In a
Cellar," which appeared in one of the first numbers of the " Atlantic
Monthly," was greatly admired. Her writings show a wide railge
of reading and insight into character.
Her magazine stories are especially fine, and are filled with
music, beauty, and color.

1. IT was a little "play-acting girl," as the children's
nurse called'her.  Her name, on the advertising bills
posted up at every street corner, was " LITTLE ROSALIE ";
and the great delight of the children was to be allowed
to go to a matinee on a Saturday afternoon when they
could hear and see her.
Sometimes Little Rosalie was one character in the
play and sometimes she was another.  Once she was a
moonlight fairy in a little white silk gown whose long-_Q 130 9.folds fell about her feet; her soft hair was loose on her
shoulders, a star gleamed on her forehead, and another
star tipped the lily's stem she held for a wand.
With her -eyes uplifted and a white light on her face,
Rosalie sang, and the children thought a little angel from
heaven would sing and look in just that way.
2. And when, in another scene, she came dancing
on in short, gauzy skirts, with two butterfly wings of
peacock feathers upon her shoulders, and, springing upon
a cloud, went sailing up out of sight as the play ended
with soft music, they always found it difficult thoroughly
to believe that she was not a fairy indeed.
"Going to see Little Rosalie," said Tom, "is n't like
going to the theater generally. It's--"
"It's just because we love her so," said Bessy.
"And wish to see her," added Johnny.
"And I really think she knows us now," said Maidie.
"I should have liked so much to throw her my bunch of
violets, if I had dared, the very last time we were there."
"'~ "Mamma," said Kitten, "is she weally alive, or do
they only wind her up and make her go?"
"I don't believe she's alive just as we are," said
Fanny. "She has those lovely wings, you know."
"She does n't have them all the time," said Joe; " she
does n't have them  when she's kneeling by her dying
mother or selling the things in the street."-49 131 9.."Oh, then," said Bessy, "she's acting!  And the
wings are probably folded up under her ragged gown."
"But I should think they'a show just a little bit."
"Well, they don't.  Oh, should n't you like to know
her, Maidie, and talk with her once?"
4. " I am acquainted with her," said their motlher.
"You, mamma, you?" came a chorus. "0 mamma,
you can't mean so!  How did it happen?  Tell fis all
about it, please!"
"Is she a truly person?" asked Kitten.
"Yes, she is a'truly' person," answered their mother.
"She lives on a street around the corner a little way
from the theater. She has a mother, --a very sick
mother, -and an old grandmother and a number of
brothers and sisters. And she takes care of all of them."
"Takes care? " said Maidie, drawing her puzzled brows
together.
5. " Yes, actually takes care. In the first place, there is
no money for the family but that which she herself earns.
And more than that.  This lovely little fairy creature
who seems to you a being of wings and colors, of light,
music, and grace, rises in the morning and makes the
fire and dresses the children, - they are all younger than
she herself.
"Then she prepares the breakfast and makes her mother
comfortable, helps her poor old grandmother, and arranges-4e 132 8&lt;the rooms. Some of the younger ones help her in that.
And then she goes to rehearsal; that is, to the empty
theater, where they practice portions of the evening work,
with nobody to look on or applaud.
LITTLE ROSALIE AT HOME.
6. "' Well, then, rehearsal over:" resumed their mother,
with a smile, "our Little Rosalie goes to market, and
comes home, gets dinner, and clears it away.  And if
she has a new part to learn, she sits down to study it.
She has to practice her dances sometimes for hours, and
her songs, too. Oh, she works every day for many
hours harder than you ever worked any hour in your
lives.
"When the play is over she comes out of the stage-.9 133 Gcdoor into the night. It is often snowy and slippery, or
dark and muddy from a heavy rain, with not a star to be
seen. Sometiines she has a little supper with her grandmother before she creeps into bed, tired out; but often
she goes to bed hungry."
7. I"0 mamma," cried Maidie, with tears in her sweet
eyes, "I think it is so cruel. If she could only come and
live with us! "
"And what would become then of her mother and
grandmother, of her sisters and brothers?  They have
nobody but Rosalie to do anything for them, and would
have to go to the almshouse or die of starvation if it
were not for her earnings."
"Oh, I forgot! "
"Papa could take care of them! " exclaimed Johnny.
"There are people worse off than these," resumed
mamma; " people who have n't even any Rosalie to earn
money for them. And such people need all the time and
money that papa and I have to spare."
8. "But it all seems so strange," said Fanny; "that I
can't get quite used to it. She lives around the corner
there, in some rooms, and cooks and sweeps and sews,
and has a mother and brothers and sisters as we do?"
"Yes, and I suppose her mother's heart aches to have
poor little Rosalie doing so much; no doubt she often
grieves over it. All the children look upon Rosalie asthe one who gives them everything they have, as their
guardian angel.
"When you saw her in that singing-play hovering over
the children asleep in the wood, with the great rosy
wings arching up above her head and pointing down
below her feet, you did n't dream that she really was a
guardian angel to so many, did you?"
9. "0 mamma," cried Maidie, with tears in her eyes,
"and I am of no use at all! Can't we go and see her at
her real home, mamma, or have her come to see us?" she
added, wistfully.
"I am afraid it would do her no good, my dear. It
is no kindness to make her discontented with her. own
home. And ours is very different."
"We all wish Rosalie to like us," said Maidie.
"Rosalie's too busy for that sort of thing! " said Tom,
with great- contempt.
" I don't know that she is," said Maidie. "Once- II never told anybody- but once when she was so very
near our box, you know, I really did throw her a little
lace bag full of chocolates - those lovely chocolates that
Uncle John gives us. And she caught it and looked over
and laughed, and actually slipped one into her mouth -"
10. "Well," interrupted Tom, looking up from the
heavy calculations that he had been making, "we can't
go next Saturday - unless Aunt Lydia' chips in."'  And,
-  134 &amp;to everybody's amazement, Aunt Lydia did "chip in" a
bright two-dollar-and-a-half gold piece on the spot.
That night, in their little beds in the big bedroom,
most of the children, as usual, could hardly close their
eyes for joy over the expected outing.
"Say, Maidie, are you asleep?" whispered Bessy.
"Of course not," answered Maidie.  "How do you
suppose I can sleep when I'm going over in my mind
the music that Rosalie is going to sing and dance to next
Saturday? And--O Bessy, how beautiful it is for anybody to do all the good that Rosalie does in the world!
Oh, if I could only be of use to people -"
11. " Oh, you are, Maidie dear, you are of the greatest
use to me! I don't know what I should do'Without
you!" exclaimed her little bedfellow, clasping Maidie in
her arms and able to speak her heart filly because it
was dark. "You see to my work, and you make up our
quarrels, and you get mamma to let us do things, and -
and "
"But, you see, if I died, - to-morrow, say, -you would
all get along as well without me in a little while. I'm
not really necessary to anybody. And she is really necessary just to keep ever so mnany people alive, and to bring
them up and help them on in the world.
"And, then, think to how many people she gives pleasure; and how many children just count the days, the way-l 136 S&amp;we do, before they go to see' Little Rosalie.' Oh, if I
could but be as useful in the world as she is "
And there Maidie stopped her confidences, for the
faintly murmured assents showed that Bessy would soon
be sound asleep in spite of herself.
LITTLE ROSALIE.
~ PART II.
ort'ches tra            suif f-'cient
--,11~~~  ~(sh)pir ou tt'ting          ad'mi ra ble
1. WIIAT a merry party it was that set out for the
"Old Prospero" that frosty Saturday afternoon.  Something detained the mother at home; but Aunt Nan went
in her place, and there was Nurse and Aunt Lydia and
-the door-keeper laughed to see the rest of them; he
did n't pretend to count them, and so why should I?
Maidie laughed, though,- she couldn't help it,when Aunt Lydia, after settling herself, took a phial of
water from her muff.
"There!" said Aunt Lydia.  " I never go to the theater
without it. For, you know, if there should be a fire and
one were in danger of suffocating from the smoke, only
let the handkerchief be wet in cold water and held overthe mouth and nose and one can breathe through that
and keep alive a great while longer."
2. "Nonsense, Lydia!" said Aunt Nan.  "What do
you want to frighten the children for?"
But as Maidie heard Aunt Lydia her eyes grew bigger
and bigger, so big that she could see only the daily
danger in which Little Rosalie lived. But after awhile,
and when Little Rosalie had come on the scene, Maidie
forgot that trouble in her present delight.
She was rapt in seeing a huge blossom open and let
Rosalie out, to the sound of soft music. She leaned far
from the box in her forgetful gazing; and soon it seemed
as though Rosalie, whirling very near, gave them a smile of
recognition, and then none of the children had either eyes
or thoughts for anything but. this floating, flashing sylph.
At that moment a child down in the audience cried
about something and diverted from the stage the glances
of the audience,- the glances of all but Maidie. In that
brief moment her eye beheld a dreadful sight.
Some one on the stage, however, had seen it, and the
next instant down rolled the drop scene and hid the stage
from view.
3. But not a moment too soon. For a spark had shot
out and one little flame had sprung up and another had
followed it, racing and chasing upwards till a hundred
tiny tongues of fire were flying up the inner draperyand far aloft. At the same instant some one in the back
of the audience shouted "Fire! "
It is a terrible sound in a crowded building. It made
Aunt Lydia's heart stop beating for a second, and then
she began to cry, in spite of Aunt Nan's calm voice, and
to huddle the children together to rush for the door.
But it came upon Maidie in that moment that if everybody rushed to the door at once nobody could get there.
Those in front would be crowded and knocked down
by others piling upon them, and all buried under one
another, stifled and killed, --so that fire itself could do
no more.
Oh, why was there nobody to prevent it? If papa
were but there! Oh, thank Heaven, thank Heaven, he
was not, - if there was no escape! Could nobody hinder?
4. This was all realized in two breaths. And in a third
breath the drop scene was pulled aside a trifle, some of
the orchestra took up the music that had stopped for
only a few beats, and out bounded Little Rosalie with her
long scarf and basket, spinning and pirouetting halfway
across the stage, and pausing in the middle of the
prettiest attitude of the "Great Bonbon Act."
Out of the charming basket on her arm she caught and
whirled hundreds of bonbons as far as her hand could
throw them among the babies in the audience.
The thought rushed into Maidie's mind that the stage'IO 139 9.people were afraid of the panic and the crush, and so had
sent Little Rosalie out with the bonbons to dance as if
nothing were the matter, hoping thus to prevent the
sudden attempt of so many to get out at once.
5. For Maidie herself had seen the fire. And she knew
it was actually in there, climbing higher and higher; and
she could hear from where she was the breathless movements of those behind the curtain who were trying to
smother it.
But something else rushed over Maidie, too. It was
that if Little Rosalie stayed there another'moment she
would herself be burned alive, and then what would
become of the mother and the grandmother and the
twins, who had nobody but Rosalie in the whole wide
world?
And before Maidie fairly knew what she was doing
she sprang from the box - it was but a single step -
and had run across the stage before all the people and
had clasped Little Rosalie, crying quickly and softly,"Oh, run, run, Little Rosalie, run'. Save yourself!
For I really saw the fire!  And," as Rosalie did not
run, "what will they do at home without you if you
are killed here? And there are so many of us at home
that nobody will miss me very much! I will stay instead
of you!"
6. Poor Maidie! As if her staying would have been-..  140    -
of the least use! But she never thought of that. She
only thought that if some child must stay there it would
better be she than Rosalie. And even while she pleaded
up went the great drop scene, rolling to the top, and out
flocked all the players of the scene.
And then a group of the strangest looking people were
caressing Maidie, and little Rosalie herself was hanging
on her neck one moment, and somebody took her by the
hand and led her round by some back way to the box
again.
Aunt Lydia was just resuming her seat, but was still
quite determined to go out and take the children with
her. The children were quite as determined not to go,
And, indeed, their pleadings finally carried the day.
7. But that night Maidie's father came into the room
where she lay in her little bed much too excited to sleep.
"It was one of the bravest things I ever heard of, -
Little Rosalie's act," said he.  "Such a child as that
must not be wasted. And a subscription is to be taken
up that will bring a sufficient sum to complete her
education in whatever way is thought best."
"Oh, you don't mean so, papa! " came a chorus from
all the beds. "Oh, how glad I am! And to take care
of all her folks at home, too, papa?"
"But as for you, my little darling," continued her
father to Maidie, "how  could you possibly think you-4  1 4 1 8were of so little use at home as to be willing to break
our hearts by risking the loss of your life? What if I
had come home to-night and found no Maidie to meet
me?"
8. And Maidie started up and threw her arms about
her father, touched to the heart by her sudden feeling
of what his grief - might have been. "I want you never
to forget, little daughter," he went on, "that you are of
great and important use in the family. Are you not my
little comforter?
"How are all these children to grow up without the
example and the care of their eldest sister? Our duties
all begin at lhome. Heroic actions are great and admirable. But there are other actions just as admirable.
"Among these are the daily acts of duty done, with
which you make life pleasant and easy for your mother
and me, for Tom, for Kitten, and for all of us. When
I remember that I never saw my Maidie out of temper
in my life-"
9. "Nor heard her speak rudely to any one," interrupted the listening Bessy.
"Nor knew of her telling anything but the truth,"
cried Tom from the other room.
"C Nor heard her say' I can't' when you ask her to tie
your ribbons or to do your sum or to find your needle,"
added Fanny.-40 14.2 9."Nor knew her to do anything but to try to make
everybody about her happy and keep her own sweet
soul white in the eyes of Heaven," continued her father.
"When I remember this of Maidie, I think all this daily
service is of as much worth as the one heroic deed that
risks life to save the lives of' others."
DOWN TO SLEEP.
BY HELEN HUNT JACKSON.
NOVEMBER woods are bare and still;
November days are clear and bright;
Each noon burns up the morning chill;
The morning snow is gone by night;
Each day my steps grow slow, grow light,
As through the woods I reverent creep,
Watching all things lie v" down to sleep."
I never knew before what beds,
Fragrant to smell, and soft to touch,
The forest sifts and shapes and spreads;
I never knew before how much
Of human sounds there is in such
Low tones as through the forest sweep
When all wild things lie "down to sleep."-  143.Each day I find new coverlids
Tucked in and more sweet eyes shut tight;
Sometimes the viewless mother bids
Her ferns kneel down, full in my sight;
I hear their chorus of "good-night."
And half I smile, and half I weep,
Listening while they lie "down to sleep."
November woods are bare and still;
November days are bright and good;
Life's noon burns up life's morning chill;
Life's night rests feet which long have stood;
Some warm, soft bed, in field or wood,
The mother will not fail to keep,
Where we can lay us "down to sleep."1:-48 144  &lt;THE SHIPWRECK.
BY CHARLES DICKENS.
From "David Copperfield."
THIS is a selection from Chapter LV of "David Copperfield,"
Dickens' masterpiece. This chapter contains the famous description of a great storm at Yarmouth. Ham Peggotty, one of the
noblest characters in Dickens, attempts to reach the wreck and
loses his life. Other parts of this chapter should be read to the
pupil in connection with this brief extract.

1. I PUT up at an old inn at Yarmouth and went down
to look at the sea, staggering along the street which was
strewn with sand and seaweed and with flying blotches
of sea foam, afraid of falling slates and tiles and holding
by people I met at angry corners.
Coming near the beach, I saw, not only the boatmen,
but half the people of the town lurking behind buildings;
some now and then braving the fury of the storm to look
away to sea, and blown sheer out of their course in
trying to get zigzag back.-- 145 9
Joining these groups, I found bewailing women whose
husbands were away in herring or oyster boats, which
there was too much reason to think might have foundered
before they could run in anywhere for safety.
2. Grizzled old sailors were among the people, shaking
their heads as they looked from water to sky and muttering to one another. Even stout mariners, disturbed
and anxious, leveled their glasses at the sea from behind
places of shelter, as if they were surveying an enemy.
The tremendous sea itself, when I could find sufficient
pause to look at it, in the agitation of the blinding wind,
the flying stones and sand, and the awful noise, confounded me. As the high, watery walls came rolling in,
and, at their highest, tumbled into surf, they looked as if
the least would ingulf the town.
As the receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar, it
seemed to scoop out a deep cave in the beach, as if its
purpose were to undermine the earth. When some whiteheaded billows thundered on and dashed themselves to
pieces before they reached the land, every fragment of
the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of
its wrath, rushing to. be gathered to the composition
of another monster.
3. Undulating hills were changed to valleys, undulating valleys (with a solitary stormbird sometimes skimming through them) were lifted up to hills; masses of-m 146 8.water shivered and shook the beach with a booming
sound.
Every shape tumultuously rolled on, as soon as made,
to change its shape and place, and beat another shape
and place away; the ideal shore on the horizon, with its
towers and buildings, rose and fell; the clouds flew fast
and quick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of
all nature.
4. Not finding Ham among the people, I made my
way to his house. It was shut, and as no one answered
to my knocking, I went, by backways and by-lanes, to
the yard where he worked. I learned there that he had
gone to Lowestoft to meet some sudden exigency of shiprepairing in which his skill was required, but that he
would be back to-morrow morning in good time.
I went back to the inn; and when I had washed and
dressed, and tried to sleep, but in vain, it was five o'clock
in the afternoon. I had not sat five minutes by the
coffee-room fire when the waiter, coming to stir it, told
me that two colliers had gone down, with all hands, a
few miles away; and that some other ships had been seen
laboring hard in the Roads and trying in great distress
to keep off shore.
5. If such a wind could rise, I think it was rising.
The howl and roar, the rattling of the doors and windows,
the rumbling in the chimneys, the apparent rocking of-08 147  4.the very house that sheltered me, and the prodigious
tumult of the sea were more fearful than in the morning.
But there was now a great darkness besides, and that
invested the storm with new terrors, real and fanciful.
At length, the steady ticking of the undisturbed clock on
the wall tormented me to that degree that I resolved to
*go to bed.
6. When I awoke it was broad day- eight or nine
o'clock; the storm was raging, and some one was knocking and calling at my door.
"What is the matter?" I cried.
"A wreck! Close by! "
I sprang out of bed, and asked, "What wreck?"
" A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit
and wine. Make haste, sir, if you want to see her! It's
thought, down on the beach, she'll go to pieces every
moment."
7. The excited voice went clamoring along the staircase; and I wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as
I could and ran into the street.
Numbers of people were there before me, all running in
one direction to the beach. I ran the same way, outstripping a good many, and soon came facing the wild sea.
Having upon it the additional agitation of the whole
night, it was infinitely more terrific than when I had
seen it last.-o 148  
8. In the difficulty of hearing anything but the wind
and waves, and in the crowd and the unspeakable confusion and my first breathless efforts to stand against the
weather, I was so confused that I looked out to sea for
the wreck and saw nothing but tae foaming heads of the
great waves.
A half-dressed boatman standing next to me pointed
with his bare arm (a tattooed arrow on it, pointing in
the same direction) to the left. Then I saw it close in
upon us.
One mast was broken shor.t off six or eight feet from
the deck and lay over the side, entangled in a maze of
sail and rigging; and all that ruin, as the ship rolled and
beat, --which she did without a moment's pause and
with a violence quite inconceivable,--beat the side as
if it would stave it in.
9. Some efforts were even then being made to cut this
portion of the wreck away; for as the ship, which was
broadside on, turned toward us in her rolling, I plainly
descried her people at work with axes.
But a great cry, which was audible even above the
wind and water, rose from the shore at this moment;
the sea, sweeping over the rolling wreck, made a clean
breach and carried men, spars, casks, planks, bulwarks,
heaps of such toys into the boiling surge.
10. The second mast was yet standing, with the rags-a8 1499.4of a rent sail and a wild confusion of broken cordage
flapping to and fro.  The ship had struck once, the same
boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and then lifted in
and struck again.
I understood him to add that s)e was parting amidships, and I could readily suppose so, for the rolling and
beating were too tremendous for any human work to
suffer long.
There was a bell on board, and as the ship rolled and
dashed, like a desperate creature driven mad, now showing us the whole sweep of her deck as she turned on her
beam-ends toward the shore, now nothing but her keel
as she sprang wildly over and turned toward the sea, the
bell rang and its sound was borne toward us on the wind.
11. Again we lost her, and again she rose. The lifeboat had been bravely manned an hour ago and could
do nothing; and as no man would be so desperate as to
attempt to wade off with a rope and establish a communication with the shore, there was nothing left to try.
All at once I noticed that some new sensation moved
the people on the beach and saw them part and Ham
coming breaking through them to the front. I ran to
him, held him back with both arms, and implored the
men not to let him stir from off that sand! I might as
hopefully have entreated the wind.
12. I was swept away, but not unkindly, to some-48 150 9.distance, where the people around me made me stay,
urging, as I confusedly perceived, that he was bent on
going, with help or without, and that I should endanger
the precautions for his safety by troubling those with
whom they rested.
I don't know what I answered or what they rejoined;
but I saw them hurrying on the beach and men running
with ropes from a ca_stan that was there, and penetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me.
Then I saw him standing alone in a seaman's frock
and trousers, a rope in his hand or slung to his wrist,
another round his body, and several of the best men
holding at a little distance to the latter, which he laid
out himself, slack upon the shore at his feet.
13. The wreck was breaking up. I saw that she was
parting in the middle and that the life of the solitary man
upon the mast hung by a thread. Still he clung to it.
Ham watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence
of suspended breath behind him and the storm before,
until there was a great retiring wave, when, with a backward glance at those who held the rope which was made
fast round his body, he dashed in after it, and in a
moment was buffeting with the water, rising with the
hills, falling with the valleys, lost beneath the foam,
then drawn again to land. They hauled in hastily.
14. He was hurt, but he took no thought of that. He-'6 151 I.'THE SHIPWRECK.
seemed hurriedly to give them some directions for leaving
him more free --or so I judged from the motion of his
arm- and was gone as before.
And now he made for the wreck, rising with the hills,
falling with the valleys, lost beneath the rugged foam,
borne in toward the shore, borne on toward the ship,
striving hard and valiantly. The distance was nothing,
but the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly.
At length he neared the wreck. He was so near that
with one more of his vigorous strokes he would be clinging to it, when a high, green, vast hillside of water
moved on shoreward from beyond the ship. He seemed-.g  152 9.to leap up into it with a mighty bound, and the ship was
gone!
15. Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a
mere cask had been broken, in Tunning to the spot where
they were hauling in. Consternation was in every face.
They drew him to my very feet - insensible, dead.
He was carried to the nearest house; and, no one preventing me now, I remained near him, busy while every
means of restoration was tried; but he had been beaten
to death by the great wave, and his generous heart was
stilled forever.
MAGGIE TULLIVER AND THE GYPSIES.
BY GEORGE ELIOT.
From " The Mill on the Floss."
MARIAN C. EVANS, known to the literary world by her pen-name
of " George Eliot," was born in the north of England about 1820.
She was an odd child and a great pet of her father, who delighted
in her quaint speeches and thoughts. She had a brother, three
years older than herself, who was very dear to her, and the little
girl would follow him about the farm,with eyes full of love, and
admiration.
In her novel " The Mill on the Floss " is a picture of their early
home life, Maggie and Tom being herself and her brother.
Her school life began when she was five years old, but she learned
slowly. In her ninth year she was sent to a larger school and
began to love her books, reading everything she could find. She
was full of enthusiasm for all that was brave and heroic, and
eager for knowledge.--&gt;8 15 3 6
During her girlhood she went to London and there took a course
of severe study. She did not beginr writing for the public until
she was over thirty,  Adaml Bede,:

Her pen was busy the rest of her
life, and she took her place as one
of the ablest Enghlish writers.  She
wrote a large nurber of novels, ea,ch

Her genius is best shown in her'

BY ABBY MORTON DIAZ.
ABBY MORTON DIAZ was born at Plymouth, Mass., in 1821.
The little girl was allowed to live out of doors, a free, happy life,
wandering about the ship-yards, and playing upon the beach to her
heart's content. She was very fond of playing with other children,
and often invented games, making songs to fit them.
When this play season was over, she became fond of study, and
began writing a little for children. She was full of music, and
would gather children about her and teach them to sing.
When her first story for children appeared in print she was
almost ashamed to have her friends see it, for it seemed to her
that nothing of her own was worth publishing.
The story was well received, however, and followed by many
others, which are full of nature, imagination, and fun.
She lives near Boston, and is interested at present in writing for
older people.

1. A  MAPLE TREE awoke at springtime, shivering in
the east winds.  " O0 Mother Nature," she said, "I tremble
with cold. Behold my limbs, ugly and bare. The birdsgypsies were thieves and hardly got anything to eat and
had nothing to drive but a donkey.
To-day, however, Maggie thought her misery had
reached a point at which gypsydom was her only refuge,
and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with
the sense that this was a great crisis in her life; she
would run straight away till she came to Dunlow Common, where there would certainly be gypsies, and cruel
Tom and the rest of her relations who found fault with
her should never see her any more.
2. She thought of her father as she ran along, but
she reconciled herself to the idea of parting with him by
determining that she would secretly send him a letter by
a small gypsy, who would run away without telling where
she was, and just let him know that she was well and
happy and always loved him very much.
Maggie soon got out of breath with running and
stopped to pant a little, reflecting that running away was
not a pleasant thing until one had got quite to the common where the gypsies were. But her resolution had not
abated; she presently passed through the gate into the
lane, not knowing where it would lead her.
3. She was used to wandering about the fields by herself, and was less timid there than on the highroad.
Sometimes she had to climb over high gates, but that
was a small evil; she was getting out of reach very fast.-)8 155 8.At last, however; the green fields came to an end, and
Maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate
into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of it.
She crept through the bars of the gate and walked on
with new spirit, though not without haunting images of
a highwayman with a pistol and a blinking dwarf in
yellow with a mouth from ear to ear; for poor little
Maggie had at once the timidity of an active imagination and the darin-g that comes from impulse.
4. It was not without a leaping of the heart that she
caught sight of a small pair of bare legs sticking up, feet
uppermost, by the side of a hillock. It was a boy asleep;
and Maggie trotted along faster and more lightly, lest
she should wake him.
It did not occur to her that he was one of her friends,
the gypsies, who in all probability would have very
genial manners. But the fact was so, for at the next
bend in the lane Maggie actually saw the little semicircular black tent, with the blue smoke rising before it,
which was to be her refuge.
She even saw a tall female figure by the column of
smoke, - doubtless the gypsy mother, who provided the
tea and other groceries; it was astonishing to herself
that she did not feel more delighted.
5. It was plain she had attracted attention, for the
tall figure, who proved to be a young woman with a0

O;                    1".  -8 157 8baby on her arm, walked slowly to meet her. Maggie
looked up in the new face rather tremblingly as it
approached.
"My little lady, where are you going to? " the gypsy
said, in a tone of coaxing deference.
It was delightful and just what Maggie expected; the
gypsies saw at'once that she was a little lady, and were
prepared to treat her accordingly.
"Not any farther," said Maggie, feeling as if she were
saying what she had rehearsed in a dream. " I'm come
to stay with you, please."
"That's pretty; come, then. Why, what a nice little
lady you are, to be sure," said the gypsy, taking her by
the hand.  Maggie thought her very agreeable, but
wished she had not been so dirty.
6. There was quite a group round the fire when they
reached it. An old gypsy woman was seated on the
ground; two small shock-headed children were lying
prone and resting on their elbows, and a placid donkey
was bending his head over a tall girl, who, lying on her
back, was scratching his nose and indulging him with a
bite of excellent stolen hay.
The slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them, and the
scene was very pretty and comfortable, Maggie thought,
only she hoped they would soon set out the tea-cups.
Everything would be quite charming when she had-.8 158 9etaught the gypsies to use a washing-basin and to feel an
interest in books.
7. It was a little confusing, though, that the young
woman began to speak to the old one in a language which
Maggie did not understand, while the tall girl who was
feeding the donkey sat up and stared at her without
offering any salutation. At last the old woman said:
"What, my pretty lady, are you come to stay with
us? Sit ye down and tell us where you come from."
It was just like a story; Maggie liked to be called
pretty lady and treated in this way. She sat down and
said:
"I'm come from home because I'm unhappy, and I
mean to be a gypsy. I'll live with you, if you like, and
I can teach you a great many things."
8. " Such a clever little lady," said the woman with
the baby, sitting down by Maggie and allowing baby to
crawl; " and such a pretty bonnet and frock," she added,
taking off Maggie's bonnet and looking at it, while she
made an observation in the unknown language to the old
woman. The tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it
on her own head hind-foremost,with a grin; but Maggie
was determined not to show any weakness on this
subject.
"I don't want to wear a bonnet," she said; "I'd
rather wear a red handkerchief like yours."-48 1 S96." Oh, what a nice little lady!  and rich, I'm  sure,"
said the old woman. "Didn't you live in a beautiful
house at home?"
9. C' Yes, my home is pretty, and I'm very fond of the
river where we go fishing; but I'm often very unhappy.
I should have liked to bring my books with me, but I
came away in a hurry, you know. But I can tell you
almost everything there is in my books, I've read them
so many tinles, and that will amuse you. And I can tell
you something about geography, too- that's about the
world we live in - very useful and interesting. Did you
ever hear about Columbus?"
10. Maggie's eyes had begun to sparkle and her
cheeks to flush--she was really beginning to instruct
the gypsies and gaining great influence over, them.
The gypsies themselves were'not without amazement
at this talk, though their attention was divided by the
contents of Maggie's pocket, which the friend at her
right hand had by this time emptied without attracting
her notice.
"Is that where you live, my little lady?" said the old
woman at the mention of Columbus.
"Oh, no! " said Maggie, with some pity; "Coltmbus
was a very wonderful man who found out half the world,
and they put chains on him, and treated him very badly,
you know -it's in my catechism of geography --but. 160o 9perhaps it's rather too long to tell before tea. I want
my tea so."
11. "Why, she's hungry, poor little lady," said the
younger woman. "Give her some o' the cold victual.
You've been walking a good way, I'll be bound, my
dear. Where's your home?"
"It's Dorlcote Mill, a good way off," said Maggie.
"My father is Mr. Tulliver; but we must n't let him
know where I am, else he'll fetch me home again.
Where does the queen of the gypsies live?"
"What! do you want to go to her, my little lady?"
said the younger woman.
"No," said Maggie; " I'm only thinking that if she
is n't a very good queen you might be glad when she
died and you could choose another. If I was a queen,
I'd be a very good queen and kind to everybody."
"Here's a bit o' nice victual, then," said the old
woman, handing to Maggie a lump of dry bread, which
she had taken from a bag of scraps, and a piece of cold
bacon.
12. "Thank you," said Maggie, looking at the food
without taking it; "but will you give me some bread
and lJutter and tea instead? I don't like bacon."
"We've no tea nor butter," said the old woman, with
something like a scowl, as if she were getting tired of
coaxing.-.8 161 S." Oh, a little bread and treacle would do," said
Maggie.
"We've no treacle," said the old woman crossly;
whereupon there followed a sharp dialogue between the
two women in. their unknown tongue, and one of the
small children snatched at the bread and bacon and
began to eat it.
At this moment the tall girl, who had gone a few
yards off, came back and said something which produced a strong effect. The old woman, seeming to forget Maggie's hunger, poked the skewer into the pot with
new vigor, and the younger crept under the tent and
reached out some platters and spoons.
13. Maggie trembled a little and was afraid the tears
would come into her eyes. But the springing tears were
checked by a new terror when two men came up. The
elder of the two carried a bag, which he flung down,
addressing the women in a loud and scolding tone, while
a black cur ran barking up to Maggie and threw her into
a tremor.
Maggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be
queen of these people or ever communicate to them
amusing and useful knowledge.
Both the men now seemed to be inquiring about
Maggie, for they looked at her, and the tone of the conversation became of that kind which implies curiosity onone side ahd the power of satisfying it on the other. At
last the younger woman said, in her coaxing tone;
"This nice little lady's come to live with us; aren't
you glad? "
14. "Ay, very glad," said the younger, who was looking
at Maggie's silver thimble and other small matters that
had been taken from her pocket. He returned them all,
except the thimble, to the younger woman, and she
immediately restored them to Maggie's pocket, while the
men seated themselves and began to attack the contents
of the kettle, -a stew of meat and potatoes, - which had
been taken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter.
Maggie began to think that Tom must be right about
the gypsies; they must certainly be thieves, unless the
man meant to return her thimble by and by.  She
would willingly have given it to him, for she was not at
all attached to her thimble; but the idea that she was
among thieves prevented her from feeling any comfort in
the revival of attention toward her. All thieves except
Robin Hood Were wicked people. The woman saw that
she was frightened.
15. "We've got nothing nice for a lady to eat," said
the old woman, in her coaxing tone. "And she's so
hungry, sweet little lady."
"Here, my dear, try if you can eat a bit o' this," said
the younger woman, handing some of the stew on a-I. 163!.brown dish with an iron spoon to Maggie, who, remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her
for not liking the bread and bacon, dared not refuse the
stew, though fear had chased away her appetite.
If her father would but come by in the gig and take her
up! Or even if Jack the Giant-killer, or Mr. Greatheart,
or St. George, who slew the dragon on the half-pennies,
would happen to pass that way! But Maggie thought
with a sinking heart that these heroes were never seen in
the neighborhood of St. Ogg's. Nothing very wonderful
ever came there.
16. Her ideas about the gypsies had undergone a rapid
modification in the last five minutes. From having considered them very respectful companions, she had begun
to think that they meant perhaps to kill her as soon
as it was dark. It was no use trying to eat the stew,
and yet the thing she most dreaded was to offend the
gypsies.
"What! you don't like the smell of it, my dear," said,
the young woman, observing that Maggie did not even
take a spoonful of the stew. "Try a bit, come."
"No, thank you," said Maggie, trying to smile in a
friendly way.  "I have n't time, I think; it seems
getting darker. I think I must go home now and come
again another day, and then I can bring you % basket
with some jam tarts and nice things."are all coming back from the South, and I would look my
best. They will soon be building their nests. 0, a bird'snest does make a tree so pleasant! But they will not
come to me, because I have no leaves to hide them!"
2. And kind Mother Nature smiled, and presented her
daughter Maple with such multitudes of leaves! More
than you could count! These gave beauty to the tree,
besides keeping the rain out of the bird's-nests. For birds
had quickly come to build there, and there was reason to
expect a lively summer.
3. A happy Maple Tree now was she, and well pleased
with her pretty green leaves. They were so beautiful in
the sunlight; and the winds whispered such sweet things
to them as to make them dance for joy! A pair of golden
robins had a home there, and thrushes came often. Sunshine and song all day lori! Or if the little leaves
became hot and thirsty in the summer's heat, good Mother
Nature gave them cooling rain-drops to drink. A happier
Maple Tree could nowhere be found.
4. "Thanks! thanks, Mother Nature," she said, " for
all your care and your loving kindness to me! "
But when autumn came with its gloomy skies and its
chilling winds, the Maple Tree grew sad, for she heard
her little leaves saying to each other, "We are going to
die! We are going to die!"'People living near said, "Hark! Do you hear the17. Maggie rose from her seat; but her hope sank
when the old gypsy woman said, " Stop a bit, stop a bit,
little lady; we'll take you home, all safe, when we've
done supper. You shall ride home like a lady."
Maggie sat down again, with little faith in this promise, though she presently saw the tall girl putting a bridle
on the donkey and throwing a couple of bags on his
back.
"Now, then, little missis," said the younger man, rising and leading the donkey forward, "tell us where you
live; what's the name o' the place?"
"Dorlcote Mill is my home," said Maggie eagerly.
" My father is Mr. Tulliver; he lives there."
"What! a big mill a little way this side o' St. Ogg's?"
"Yes," said Maggie. "Is it far off? I think I should
like to walk there, if you please."
18. "No, no, it'll be getting dark; we must make
haste. And the donkey'll carry you as nice as can be;
you'11 see."
He lifted Maggie as he spoke and set her on the
donkey.
" Here's your pretty bonnet," said the younger woman,
putting that recently despised but now welcome article
of costume on Maggie's head; "and you'll say we've
been very good to you, won't you? and what a nice little
lady we said you was?"
-17 164  0--B 1 65 9E"Oh, yes, thank you," said Maggie. " I'm very much
obliged to you. But I wish you'd go with me, too." She
thought anything was better than going with one of the
dreadful men alone.
"Ah! you're fondest o' me, aren't you?" said the
woman. "But I can't go; you'll go too fast for me."
19. It now appeared that the man also was to be
seated on the donkey, holding Maggie before him.
When the woman had patted her on the back and said
"Good-bye," the donkey, at a strong hint from the man's
stick, set off at a rapid walk along the lane toward the
point Maggie had come from an hour ago. The tall
girl and the rough urchin, also furnished with sticks,
obligingly escorted them for the first hundred yards,
with much screaming and thwacking.
Much terrified was poor Maggie in this entirely natural ride on a short-paced donkey, with a gypsy behind
her, who considered that he was earning half a crown.
The red light of the setting sun seemed to have a portentous meaning, with which the alarming bray of the
second donkey with the log on its foot must surely have
some connection.
20. Two low, thatched cottages - the only houses they
passed in this lane --seemed to add to its dreariness;
they had no windows to speak of, and the doors were
closed.  It was probable that they were inhabited by-- 166 84witches, and it was a relief to find that the donkey did
not stop there.
At last  oh, sight of joy!- this lane, the longest
in the world, was coming to an end, was opening on
a broad highroad, where there was actually a coach passing! The gypsy really meant to take her honle, then; he
was probably a good man, after all, and might have been
rather hurt at the thought that she did n't like coming
with him alone.
This idea became stronger as she felt more and more
certain that she knew the road quite well, and she was
considering how she might open a conversation with the
injured gypsy when, as they reached a cross-road, Maggie
caught sight of some one coming on a white-faced horse.
21. "Oh, stop, stop!" she cried out. "There's my
father!  0, father, father!"
The sudden joy was almost painful, and before her
father reached her she was sobbing. Great was Mr. Tulliver's wonder, for he had made a round from Basset and
had not yet been home.
"Why, what's the meaning o' this? " he said, checking
his horse, while Maggie slipped from the donkey and ran
to her father's stirrup.
"The little miss lost herself, I reckon," said the gypsy.
"She'd come to our tent at the far end o' Dunlow Lane,
and I was bringing her where she said her home was.-48 187 9.It's a good way to come arter being on the tramp all
day."
22. "Oh, yes, father, he's been very good to bring me
home," said Maggie. "A very kind, good man! "
"Here, then, my man," said Mr. Tulliver, taking out
five shillings. "It's the best day's work you ever did.
I could n't afford to lose my darling girl; here, lift her
up before me."
"Why, Maggie, how's this? how's this?" he said
as they rode along, while she laid her head against
her father and sobbed. "How came you to be rambling
about and lose yourself?"
23. "0 father," sobbed Maggie, "I ran away because
I was so unhappy. Tom was so angry with me. I
could n't bear it."
"Pooh! pooh!" said Mr. Tulliver soothingly, " you
must n't think o' running away from father. What would
father do without his little girl?"
" Oh, no, I never will again, father - never."
Mr. Tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he
reached home that evening. Maggie never heard one reproach from her mother or one taunt from Tom about
her running away to the gypsies.
Maggie was rather awe-stricken by this unusual treatment and sometimes thought that her conduct had been
too wicked to be alluded to.-'.8 168.-1THE SHELL.

SEE what a lovely shell,
Small and pure as a pearl,
Lying close to my foot,
Frail, but a work divine,
Made so fairily well
With delicate spire and whorl,
How exqulisitely minute,,
A miracle of design!
What is it? A learned man
Could give it a clumsy name.
Let him name it who can,
The beauty would be the same.
The tiny cell is forlorn,
Void of the living will
That made it stir on the shore.

Of his house in a rainbow frill?
Did he push, when he was uncurled,
A golden foot or a fairy horn
Through his dim water world?-4a 169 9.Slight, to be crushed with a tap
Of my finger nail on the sand!

Of cataract seas that snap

Athwart the ledges of rock,

1. WIEN I was in Germany I spent several weeks of
the summer time in a small town among the Thuringian
Mountains. There is not much farming land. The men
cut wood, the women spin flax and bleach linen, and the
children gather berries, tend cattle on the high mountain
pastures, or act as guides to the summer travelers.A great many find employment in the manufacture of
toys, for which there are several establishments in this
region, producing annually many thousands of crying
and speaking dolls, bleating lambs, barking dogs, and
roaring lions.
2. Behind the town where I lived, there was a spur of
the mountains, crowned by the walls of a castle built by
one of the dukes who ruled over that part of Saxony
eight or nine hundred years ago.
In many places the forest had been cut away, leaving
open tracts where the sweet mountain grass grew thick
and strong, and where there were always masses of
heather, harebells, foxgloves, and wild pinks.
Every morning all the cattle of the town were driven
up to these pastures, each animal with a bell hanging to
its neck, and the sound of so many hundred bells tinkling
all at once made a chime which could be heard at a long
distance.
3. One of my favorite walks was to mount to the
ruined castle and pass beyond it to the flowery pasture
slopes, from which I had a wide view of the level country
to the north and the mountain ridges on both sides.
One day during my ramble I came upon two smaller
herds of cattle, each tended by a single boy. They were
near each other, but not on the same pasture, for there
was a deep hollow, or dell, between.
-A  10 ~---95 171  8eAs I came out of a thicket upon the clearing on one
side of the hollow, the herd-boy tending the cattle nearest
to me was sitting among the grass and singing with all
his might the German song commencing,
"Tra, ri, ro!
The summer's here, I know!"
His back was towards me, but I noticed that his elbows
were moving very rapidly. Curious to learn what he
was doing, I slipped quietly around some bushes to a
point where I could see him distinctly, and found that
he was knitting a woolen stocking. Presently he lifted
his head, looked across to the opposite pasture, and cried
out, " Hans! the cows!"
4. I looked also, and saw another boy of about the
same age start up and run after his cattle, the last one of
which was entering the forests. Then the boy near me
gave a glance at his own cattle, which were quietly
grazing on the slope a little below him, and went on
with his knitting.
I prevailed upon him to tell me his name and age.
He was called Otto'and was twelve years old; his father
was a woodcutter, and his mother spun and bleached
linen.
"And how much," I asked him, "do you get for taking care of the cattle?"-"a 172 9.5. " I am to have five thalers" (about four dollars), he
answered, " for the whole summer. But it does n't go to
me; it's for father. But then I make a good many
groschen by knitting, and that's for my winter clothes.
"Last year I could buy a coat, and this year I want to
get enough for trousers and new shoes. Since the cattle
know me so well, I have only to talk and they mind me;
and that, you see, gives me plenty of time to knit."
"I see," I said; "it's a very good arrangement. I
suppose the cattle over on the other pasture don't know
their boy? He has not got them all out of the woods
yet."
"Yes, they know him," said Otto, "and that's the
reason they slip away. But then cattle mind, some persons better than others; I've seen that much."
6. Here he stopped talking and commenced knitting
again. He evidently wanted to make the most of his
time. Then I again looked across the hollow, where
Hans -the other boy --had at last collected his cows.
He stood on the top of a rock flinging stones down the
steep slope. When he had no more he stuck his hands
in his pockets and whistled loudly to draw Otto's attention; but the latter pretended not to hear.
7. A few days afterwards I went up to tJe pasture
again, and came, by chance, to the head of the little dell
dividing the two herds. The first object which attracted-. 175 smy attention was Otto, knitting, as usual, beside his herd
of cows.
Then I turned to the other side to discover what Hans
was doing. His cattle this time were not straying; but
neither did he appear to be minding them in the least.
He was walking on the mountain side with his eyes fixed
upon the ground.
Sometimes he would walk on, pull a blue flower and
then a yellow one, look at them sharply, and throw them
away. "What is he after? " I said to myself.
8. The cattle were no doubt acquainted with his ways
(it is astonishing how much intelligence they have!)
and they immediately began to move towards the forest
and would'soon have wandered away if I had not headed
them off and driven them back. Then I followed them,
much to the surprise of Hans, who had been aroused by
the noise of their bells as they ran from me.
"You don't keep a very good watch, my boy! " I said.
As he made no answer, I asked, "Have you lost anything?"
"No," he then said.
"What have you been hunting so long?"
He looked confused, turned away his head, and muttered, "Nothing."
9. This made me sure he had been hunting something,
and I felt a little curiosity to know what it was. But,wind? It sounds like fall."  Nobody told them it was
the leaves, all over the forest, saying to each other,'" We
are going to die! We are going to die!"
"My dear little leaves!" sighed the Maple Tree.'"Poor things, they mnust go!  Ah, how sad to see them
droop and fade away!"
A WOODLAND SCENE,
5.' I will make their death beautiful,"   said kind
Mother Nature. And she changed their color to a scarlet,
whichl-glowed in the sunlight like fire.
And every one said, cc How beautiful! "
And one cold morning she stood with her limbs all-4  1 749.although I asked him again and offered to help him hunt
it, he would tell me nothing. He had a restless and
rather unhappy look, quite different from the bright,
cheerful eyes and pleasant countenance of Otto.
His father, he said, worked in a mill below the town
and got good wages; so he was allowed half the pay for
tending the cattle during the summer.
"What will you do with the money?" I asked.
"Oh, I'll soon spend it," he said. "I could spend a
hundred times that much if I had it."
"Indeed! " I exclaimed. "No doubt it's all the better
that you have n't it."
10. He did not seem to like this remark and was afterwards disinclined to talk; so I left him and went over to
Otto, who was as busy and cheerful as ever.
"Otto," said I, "do you know what Hans is hunting
all over the pasture?  Has he lost anything?"
"No," Otto answered, "he has not lost anything, and
I don't believe he will find anything, either. Because,
even if it's all true, they say you never come across it
when you look for it, but it just shows itself all at once
when you're not expecting it."
"What is it, then?" I asked.
11. Otto looked at me a moment and seemed to hesitate.  He appeared also to be a little surprised.  He
finally asked, "Don't you know, sir, what the shepherdfound, somewhere about here, a great many hundred
years ago?"
C No," I answered.
"Not the key-flower?"
Then I did know what he meant and understood the
whole matter in a moment. But I wanted to know what
Otto had heard of the story, and therefore said to him,
" I wish you would tell me all about it."
12. "Well," he began, " some say it was true and some
that it was n't. At any rate, it was a long, long while
ago, and there's no telling how much to believe. My
grandmother told me; but, then, she did n't know the
man. She only heard about him from her grandmother.
He was a shepherd and used to tend his sheep on the
mountain -or maybe it was cbws, I'm not sure- in
some place where there were a great many kobolds and
fairies.
13. " It was in summer, and he was walking along after
his sheep, when all at once he saw a wonderful, sky-blue
flower, of a kind he had never seen before in all his life.
Some people say it was sky-blue and some that it was
golden yellow; I don't know which is right. Well, however it was, there was the wonderful flower, as large as
your hand, growing in the grass.
"The shepherd stooped down and- broke the stem; but
just as he was lifting up the flower to examine it he saw-8 176 9ethat there was a door in the side of the mountain. Now,
he had been over the ground a hundred times before and
had never seen anything of the kind.
"He looked into it for a long time and at last plucked
up heart and in he went. After forty or fifty steps he
found himself in a large hall full of chests of gold and
diamonds. There was an old kobold with a white beard
sitting in a chair beside a large table in the middle of the
hall.
"The shepherd was at first frightened, but the kobold
looked at him with a friendly face and said,'Take what
you want, and don't forget the best!'
14. " So the shepherd laid the flower on the table and
went to work and filled his pockets with the gold and
diamonds. When he had as much as he could carry the
kobold said again,'Don't forget the best!''That I
won't,' the shepherd thought to himself, and took more
gold and the biggest diamonds he could find, and filled his
hat so that he could scarcely stagger under the load.
"He was leaving the hall when the kobold cried out,'Don't forget the best!' But he could n't carry any
more and went on, never minding. When he reached
the door on the mountain side, he heard the voice again
for the last time,'Don't forget the best!'
15. "The next minute he was out on the pasture.
When he looked around, the door had disappeared; his-8 177 8Opockets and hat grew light all at once, and instead of
gold and diamonds he found nothing but dry leaves and
pebbles. He was as poor as ever, and all because he had
forgotten the best.
"Now, sir, do you know what the best was? Why, it
was the flower which he had left on the table in the
kobold's hall. That was the key-flower. When you find
it and pull it, the door is opened to all the treasures
under ground.
" If the shepherd had kept it, the gold and diamonds
would have stayed so; and, besides, the door would have
been always open to him, and he could then help himself
whenever he wanted."
16. "Did you ever look for the key-flower?" I asked
Otto.
He grew a little red in the face, then laughed, and
answered: "Oh, that was the first summer I tended the
cattle, and I soon got tired of it. But I guess the flower
does n't grow any more now."
"How long has Hans been looking for it?"
"He looks every day," said Otto, "when he gets tired
of doing nothing. But I should n't wonder if he was
thinking about it all the time, or he'd look after his
cattle better than he does."
17. As I walked down the mountain that afternoon I
thought a great deal about these two herd-boys and the1 I78 &gt;
story of the key-flower. Up to this time the story had
only seemed to me to be a curious and beautiful fairy
tale; but now I began to think it might mean something
more. Here was Hans neglecting his cows and making
himself restless and unhappy in the hope of some day
finding the key-flower; while Otto, who remembered that
it can't be found by hunting for it, was attentive to his
task, always earning a little, and always contented.
Therefore, the next time I walked up to the pastures
I went straight to Hans. "Have you found the keyflower yet?" I asked.
18. There was a curious expression upon his face. He
appeared to be partly ashamed of what he must now and
then have suspected to be a folly, and partly anxious to
know if I could tell him where the flower grew.
"See here, Hans," said I, seating myself upon a rock.
"Don't you know that those who hunt for it never find
it? Of course you have not found it, and you never will,
in this way. But even if you should, you are so anxious
for the gold and diamonds that you would be sure to
forget the best, just as the shepherd did, and would find
nothing but leaves and pebbles in your pockets."
"Oh, no! " he exclaimed; "that's just what I would n't
do."
19. " Don't you forget your work every day?" I asked.
"You are forgetting the best all the time, --I mean the-40 179 9'best that you have at present. Now, I believe there is a
key-flower growing on these very mountains; and, what
is more, Otto has found it!"
He looked at me in astonishment.
"Don't you see," I continued, "how happy and contented he is all the day long? He does not work as hard
at his knitting as you do in hunting for the flower;
and, although you get half your summer's wages and he
nothing, he will be richer than you in the fall. He will
have a small piece of gold, and it won't change into a
leaf. Besides, when a boy is contented and happy he
has gold and diamonds."
20. I saw that Hans was not a bad boy; he was simply
restless, impatient, and perhaps a little inclined to envy
those in better circumstances. I knew it would be difficult for him to change his habits of thinking and wishing.
But, after a long talk, he promised me he would try, and
that was as much as I expected.
Now you may want to know whether he did try, and
I am sorry that I cannot tell you. I left the place soon
afterwards and have never been there since. Let us all
hope, however, that he found the real key-flower.-.8 1809..INCIDENT OF THE FRENCH CAMP.
BY ROBERT BROWNING.
A GREAT English poet, much praised by his admirers, and yet by
no means popular or widely read, is Robert Browning. He was
born near London in 1812, and received a good education.
At an early age he began to write poetry and continued to write
during all his long life. From the first he showed originality
and was little governed by popular opinion. He married Elizabeth
Barrett, the author of many beautiful poems.
Mr. Browning is best known by a few short poems which have
been widely read. Among these are the following: " Incident of
the French Camp," " How we Brought the Good News from Ghent
to Aix," and " The Pied Piper of Hamelin."
Mr. Browning died in Venice in 1889.
You know, we French stormed Ratisbon;
A mile or so away,
On a little mound, Napoleon
Stood on our storming day;
With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,
Legs wide, arms locked behind,
As if to balance the prone brow
Oppressive with its mind.
Just as perhaps he mused, " My plans
That soar to earth may fall,
Let once my army leader Lannes
Waver at yonder wall."-..i   18 1    fNAPOLEON AND THE WOUNDED BOY
Out'twixt the battery smokes there flew
A rider, bound on bound
Full-galloping; nor bridle drew
Until he reached the mound.
Then off there flung in smiling joy,
And held himself erect
By just his horse's mane, a boy;
You hardly could suspect
So tight he kept his lips compressed,
Scarce any blood came throughYou looked twice ere you saw his breast
Was all but shot in two.-4  1 82 9e."Well," cried he, "Emperor, by God's grace
We've got you Ratisbon!
The Marshal's in the market-place,
And you'll be there anon
To see your flag-bird flap his vans
Where I, to heart's desire,
Perched him!" The chief's eye flashed; his plans
Soared up again like fire.
The chief's eye flashed; but presently
Softened itself, as sheathes
A film the mother eagle's eye
When her bruised eaglet breathes.
"You're wounded!" " Nay," the soldier's pride
Touched to the quick, he said,
"I'm killed, Sire! " And his chief beside,
Smiling, the boy fell dead.--)8 183 S&lt;MARY  ELIZABETH.
HER TRUE STORY.
(Abridged.)
BY ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS.
IT may be remembered that we had in the Third Reader a
most interesting selection by Miss Phelps; called' Tiny's First and
Only Lie."
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps was the daughter of Austin Phelps, a
famous preacher and professor at the Theological Seminary in
Andover, Mass., and also the granddaughter of Moses Stuart, another
famous professor at the same theological'school.
Miss Phelps began to write stories  
at an early age and has been busy
with her pen for these many years.
Her  Trotty  and  Gypsy' books.
have been widely read.  ThesPe popular juveniles still hold a high rank  
with young readers.
You will wish to read some day
her sketch entitled'"The Tenth of
January," a most vivid and romnantic story of the terrible catastrophe at Lawrence, almost forty years ago, when the Pemberton
liill fell.
While Miss Phelps has written notable juvenile books, she is
miost favorably known by her novels intended for adult readers.
She gained fame by the signal ability shown by the publication of
Gates Ajartsj    published in 1868.

about her.
"Dear, pretty things! " she said. "How I shall miss
them! They were such a comfort! And how ugly I am!
Nobody will care for me now! "
But presently a flock of school-girls came along, talking
cheerily of ferns, red berries, and autumn leaves.
6. "And I think," said one, "that there's a great deal
of beauty in a tree without any leaves at all."
"So do I," said another.  "Just look up through this
tree. Its branches and boughs and twigs make a picture
against the sky!"
And the lively school-girls passed on.
"Ah," said the Maple Tree, "this will at least be
pleasant to dream about! "
For she already felt her winter's nap coming on. If
she could but have heard what her little leaves said to
each other afterwards, down there on the ground!
7. "Dear old tree! She has taken care of us all our
lives, and fed us, and held us up to the sun, and been to
us a kind mother, and now we will do something for her.
We will get under ground and turn ourselves into food to
feed her with, for she'll be sure to wake up hungry after
her long nap!"

1. MARY ELIZABETH was a little girl with a long name.
She was poor, she was sick, she was ragged, she was dirty,
she was cold, she was hungry, she'was frightened. She
had no home, she had no mother, she had no father. She
had no supper, she had had no dinner, she had had no
breakfast. She had no place to go and nobody to care
whether she went or not.
In fact, Mary Elizabeth had not much of anything but
a short pink calico dress, a little red cotton-and-wool
shawl, and her long name. Besides this, she had a pair
of old rubbers too large for her.
2. She was walking up Washington Street in Boston.
It was late in the afternoon of a bitter January day.
Already the lamplighters were coming with their long
poles, and gaslights began to flash upon the grayness--
neither day nor night - through which the child watched
the people moving dimly, with a wonder in her heart.
This wonder was as confused as the half-light in which
the crowd hurried by.-.0 185 84 -
"God made so many people," thought Mary Elizabeth,
" he must have made so many suppers. Seems as if
there'd ought to been one for one extry little girl."
But she thought this in a gentle way. She was a very
gentle little girl. All girls who had n't anything were not
like Mary Elizabeth.
3. So now she was shuffling up Washington Street, not
knowing exactly what to do next, - peeping into people's
faces, timidly looking away from them, hesitating, heartsick (for a very little girl can be very heartsick), colder,
she thought, every minute and hungrier each hour than
she was the hour before.
The child left Washington Street at last, where everybody had homes and suppers without one extra one to
spare for a little girl, and turned into a short, bright,
showy street, where stood a great hotel.
4. Whether the door-keeper was away, or busy, or sick,
or careless, or whether the head waiter at the dining-room
door was so tall that he could n't see so short a beggar, or
whether the clerk at the desk was so noisy that he could n't
hear so still a beggar, or however it was, Mary Elizabeth
did get in; by the door-keeper, past the head waiter,
under the shadow of the clerk, over the smooth, slippery,
marble floor the child crept on.-48 1 8 6 9She came to the office door and stood still. She
looked around her with wide eyes. She had never seen
a place like that. Lights flashed over it, many and bright.
Gentlemen sat in it smoking and reading. They were all
warm. Not one of them looked as if he had had no dinner and no breakfast and no supper.
5. "How many extry suppers," thought the little girl,
"it must ha' taken to feed'em  all.  I guess maybe
there'11 be one for me in here."
Mary Elizabeth stood in the middle of it, in her pink
calico dress and red plaid shawl. The shawl was tied
over her head and about her neck with a ragged tippet.
She looked very funny and round behind, like the
wooden women in the Noah's ark. Her bare feet showed
in the old rubbers. She began to shuffle about the room,
holding out one purple little hand.
6. One or two of the gentlemen laughed; some
frowned; more did nothing at all; most did not notice,
or did not seem to notice, the child. One said:
"What's the matter here?"
Mary Elizabeth shuffled on. She went from one to
another, less timidly; a kind of desperation had taken
possession of her. The odors from the dining-room came
in, of strong, hot coffee and strange, roast meats. Mary
Elizabeth thought of Jo.
It seemed to her she was so hungry that, if she could-.9 187 &amp;not get a supper, she should jump up and run and rush
about and snatch something and steal, like Jo. She held
out her hand, but only said:
"I'm hungry! "
7. A gentleman called her. He was the gentleman
who had asked, "What's the matter here?"  He called
her in behind his daily newspaper which was big enough
to hide three of Mary Elizabeth, and when he saw that
i nobody was looking he gave her a five-cent piece in a
hurry, as if he had committed a sin, and quickly said:
"There, there, child! go, now, go!"
Then he began to read his newspaper quite hard and
fast and to look severe, as one does who never gives anything to beggars, as a matter of principle.
But nobody else gave anything to Mary Elizabeth. She
shuffled from one to another hopelessly. Every gentleman shook his head. One called for a waiter to put her
out. This frightened her and she stood still.
8. Over by a window, in a lonely corner of the great
room, a young man was sitting, apart from the others.
He sat with his elbows on the table and his face buried
in his arms. He was a well-dressed young man, with
brown, curling hair.
Mary Elizabeth wondered why he looked so miserable
and why he sat alone. She thought, perhaps, if he
weren't so happy as the other gentlemen, he would bemore sorry for cold and hungry girls. She hesitated,
then walked along and directly up to him.
9. One or two gentlemen laid down their papers and
watched this; they smiled and nodded at each other.
The child did not see them, to wonder why. She went
up and put her hand upon the young man's arm.
He started. The brown, curly head lifted itself from
the shelter of his arms; a young face looked sharply at
the beggar girl,  a beautiful young face it might have
been.
It was haggard now and dreadful to look at,- bloated
and badly marked with the unmistakable marks of a
wicked week's debauch. He roughly said:
" What do you want?"
"I'm hungry," said Mary Elizabeth.
"I can't help that. Go away."
"I have n't had anything to eat for a whole day- a
whole day!" repeated the child.
10. Her lip quivered. But she spoke distinctly. Her
voice sounded through the room. One gentleman after
another had laid down his paper or his pipe. Several
were watching this little scene.
" Go away! " repeated the young man irritably. " Don't
bother me. Ihave n't had anything to eat for three days! "
His face went down into his arms again. Mary Elizabeth stood staring at the brown, curling hair. She stood-9 189.perfectly still for some moments.  She evidently was
greatly puzzled. She walked away a little distance, then
stopped and thought it over.
And now paper after paper and pipe after cigar went
down. Every gentleman in the room began to look on.
The young man with the beautiful brown curls and
dissipated, disgraced, and hidden face was not stiller than
the rest.
The little figure in the pink calico and the red shawl
and big rubbers stood for a moment silent among them
all. The waiter came to take her out, but the gentlemen
motioned him away.
11. Mary Elizabeth turned her five-cent piece over and
over slowly in her purple hand. Her hand shook. The
tears came. The smell of the dinner from the diningroom grew savory and strong. The child put the piece
of money to her lips as if she could have eaten it, then'turned and, without further hesitation, went back.
She touched the young man - on the bright hair this
time - with her trembling little hand.
The room was so still now that what she said rang out
to the corridor, where the waiters stood, with the clerk
behind looking over the desk to see.
"I'mIn sorry you are so hungry. If you haven't had
anything for three days, you must be hungrier than me.
I've got five cents. A gentleman gave it to me. I wish-.9e Igo o.MARY ELIZABETH'S GENEROUS DEED,.
you would take it. I've only gone one day. You can
get some supper with it, and-maybe- I-can get
some somewheres! I wish you'd please to take it!"
12. Mary Elizabeth stood quite still, holding out her
five-cent piece.  She did not understand the stir that
went all over the bright room. She did not see that some
of the gentlemen coughed and wiped their spectacles.
She did not know why the brown curls before her came
up with such a start, nor why the young man's wasted
face flushed red and hot with noble shame.
She did not in the least understand why he flung the
five-cent piece upon the table, and, snatching her in his-Ts 191  8
arms, held her fast and hid his face on her plaid shawl
and sobbed. Nor did she know what could be the reason
that nobody seemed amused to see this gentleman cry.
The gentleman who had given her the money came
up, and some more came up, and they gathered round,
and she in the midst of them, and they all spoke kindly,
and the young man with the bad face that might have
been so beautiful stood up, still clinging to her, and said
aloud:
"She's shamed me before you all, and she's shamed
me to myself! I'll learn a lesson from this beggar, so
help me God!"
13. So then he took the child upon his knee, and the
gentlemen came up to listen, and the young man asked
her what her name was.
"Mary Elizabeth, sir."
"Names used to mean things - in the Bible -when I
was as little as you. I read the Bible then. Does Mary
Elizabeth mean angel of rebuke?"
"Sir?"
"Where do you live, Mary Elizabeth?"
"Nowhere, sir."
"Where do you sleep?"
"In Mrs. O'Flynn's shed, sir. It's too cold for the
cows. She's so kind, she lets us stay."
" Whom do you stay with? "-_8 1 92 e.14. "Nobody, only Jo."
" Is Jo your brother?"
"No, sir. Jo is a girl. I have n't got only Jo."
"What does Jo do for a living?"
"She - gets it, sir."
"And what do you do?"
" I beg. It's better than to- get it, sir, I think."
"Where's your mother?"
"Dead."
"What did she die of?"
"Drink, sir," said Mary Elizabeth, in her distinct and
gentle tone.
"Ah - well. And your father?"
"He is dead. He died in prison."
"What sent him to prison?"
"Drink, sir."
" Oh!"
15. " I had a brother once," continued Mary Elizabeth,
who grew quite eloquent with so large an audience, "but
he died, too."
"I do want my supper," she added, after a pause,
speaking in a whisper, as if to Jo or to herself, "and
Jo'll be wondering for me."
"Wait, then," said the young man. ".I'11 see if I can't
beg enough to get you your supper."
"I thought there must be an extry one among so manyfolks! " cried Mary Elizabeth; for now, she thought, she
should get back her five cents.
And, truly, the young man put the five cents into his
hat, to begin with. Then he took out his purse, and put
in something that made less noise than the five-cent
piece and something more and more and more.
Then he passed around the great room, walking still
unsteadily, and the gentleman who gave the five cents
and all the gentlemen put something into the young
man's hat.
16. So when. he came back to the table he emptied
the hat and counted the money, and, truly, it was forty
dollars.
" Forty dollars!"
Mary Elizabeth looked frightened.
"It's yours," said the young man. "Now come to
supper.  But see! this gentleman who gave you the
five-cent piece shall take care of the money for you.
You can trust him.  He's got a wife, too.  But we'll
come to supper now."
17. So the young man took her by the hand, and the
gentleman whose wife knew all about what to do with,orphans took her by the.other hand, and one or two
more gentlemen followed, and they all went out into the
dining-room, and put Mary Elizabeth in a chair at aand the winds blew sand over them,,and there they turned
themselves into something very nice for the old Maple
Tree, -something good to take.
And now, as she wakes up again in the spring and
takes a full meal of it, she is once more lively and happy,
and many fresh young leaves unfold to clothe her limbs.

BY ANNA SEWALL.
"BLACK BEAUTY" is well known to many of the boys and girls.
It is the story of a horse and his companions which has been
widely read, and each reader becomes one of Black Beauty's friends
before he finishes the book.
Mrs. Sewall has studied animals until she understands what they
would wish to say if they could talk, and her delightful story
makes us more thoughtful and kind to them.
The old war horse was in the stable with Black Beauty and told
him his story.
bay'8 nets              sla.ugh't;er
1. CAPTAIN had been broken in and trained for an army
horse; his first owner was an officer of cavalry going out
to the Crimean War. He said he quite enjoyed the training with all the other horses, trotting together, turning
together to the right hand or the left, halting at the word
of command, or dashing forward at full speed at the sound
of the trumpet or signal of the officer.
He was, when young, a dark, dappled, iron gray, and
considered very handsome. His master, a young, highspirited gentleman, was very fond of him, and treated
him from the first with the greatest care and kindness.
He told me he thought the life of an army horse was
very pleasant; but when it came to being sent abroad over
the sea in a great ship he almost changed his mind.-.*  196 9E2. "That part of it," said he, "was dreadful!  Of
course we could not walk off the land into the ship; so
they were obliged to put strong straps under our bodies,
and then we were lifted off our legs, in spite of our struggles, and were swung through the air over the water to
the deck of the great vessel.
"There we were placed in small, close stalls, and never
for a long time saw the sky or were able to stretch our
legs.  The ship sometimes rolled about in high winds,
and we were knocked about and felt bad enough.
"However, at last it came to an end, and we were
hauled up and swung over again to the land; we were
very glad and snorted and neighed for joy when we
once more felt firm ground under our feet.
3. "We soon found that the country we had come to
was very different from our own and that we had many
hardships to endure besides the fighting; but many of the
men were so fond of their horses that they did everything
they could to make them comfortable, in spite of snow,
wet, and all things out of order."
"But what about the fighting?" said I. "Was not
that worse than anything else?"
"Well," said he, "I hardly know. We always liked to
hear the trumpet sound and to be called out, and were
impatient to start off, though sometimes we had to stand
for hours, waiting for the word of command. When--Q 197 S&lt;the word was given we used to spring forward as gayly
and eagerly as if there were no cannon balls, bayonets, or
bullets.
"I believe so long as we felt our rider firm in the
saddle and his hand steady on the bridle not one of us
gave way to fear, not even when the terrible bombshells
whirled through the air and burst into a thousand
pieces.
4. "I, with my noble master, went into many actions
together without a wound; and, though I saw horses shot
down with bullets, pierced through with lances, and
gashed with fearful saber cuts, though we left them dead
on the field or dying in the agony of their wounds, I
don't think I feared for myself.
"My master's cheery voice, as he encouraged his men,
made me feel as if he and I could not be killed. I had
such perfect trust in him that whilst he was guiding
me I was ready to charge up to the very cannon's mouth.
"I saw many brave men cut down, many fall mortally
wounded from their saddles. I had heard the cries and
groans of the dying, and frequently had to turn aside
to avoid trampling on a wounded man or horse; but
until one dreadful day I had never felt terror. That
day I shall never forget.."
5. Here old Captain paused for a while and drew a long
breath; I waited, and he went on.-8 1988s."It was one autumn morning, and, as usual, an hour
before daybreak our cavalry had turned out, ready for the
day's work, whether it might be fighting or waiting. The
men stood by their horses waiting, ready for orders.
"As the light increased there seemed to be some excitement among the officers; and before the day was well
begun we heard the firing of the enemy's guns.'" Then one of the officers rode up and gave the word
for the men to mount. In a second every man was in
his saddle and every horse stood expecting the touch of
the rein or the pressure of his rider's heels, all animated,
all eager.
"We had been trained so well that, except by the
champing of our bits and the restive tossing of our heads
from time to time, it could not be said that we stirred.
6. "My dear master and I were at the head of the
line, and, as all sat motionless and watchful, he said,' We
shall have a day of it to-day, my beauty; but we'11 do
our duty as we have done.' He stroked my neck that
morning more, I think, than he had ever done before,
quietly, on and on, as if he were thinking of something
else.
"I loved to feel his hand on my neck and arched
my crest proudly and happily; but I stood very still, for
I knew all his moods and when he liked me to be quiet
and when gay."I cannot tell all that happened on that day, but I will
tell of the last charge that we made together. It was
across a valley right in front of the enemy's cannon. By
this time we were well used to the roar of heavy guns,
the rattle of musket fire, and the flying of shot near us;
but never had I been under such a fire as we rode through
on that day.
7. " From the right, from the left, and from the front
shot and shell poured in upon us. Many a brave man went
down, many a horse fell, flinging his rider to the earth.
"Many a horse without a rider ran wildly out of
the ranks, then, terrified at being alone, with no hand to
guide him, came pressing in amongst his old companions,
to gallop with them to the charge.
"Fearful as it was, no one stopped, no one turned back.
Every moment the ranks were thinned, but as our comrades fell we closed in to keep them together; and,
instead of being shaken in our pace, our gallop became
faster and faster as we neared the cannon, all clouded in
white smoke, while the red fire flashed through it.
8. " My master, my dear master,. was cheering on his
comrades with his right arm raised on high, when one of
the balls, whizzing close to my head, struck him. I felt
him stagger with the shock, though he uttered no cry.
"I tried to check my speed, but the sword dropped from
his right hand, the rein fell loose from the left, and,
-o 1 99  --79 200 a4sinking backward from the saddle, he fell to the earth.
The other riders swept past us, and by the force of their
charge I was driven from the spot where he fell.
"' I wanted to keep my place by his side and not leave
him under that rush of horses' feet, but it was in vain;
and now, without a master or a friend, I was alone on that
great slaughter ground.
"Fear took hold on me, and I trembled as I had
never trembled before; and I, too, as I had seen other
horses do, tried to join in the ranks and gallop with them.
But I was beaten off by the swords of the soldiers.
9. "Just then a soldier, whose horse had been killed
under him, caught at my bridle and mounted me; and
with this new master I was again going forward. But our
gallant company was cruelly overpowered, and those who
remained alive after the fierce fight for the guns, came
galloping back over the same ground.
"Some of the horses had been so badly wounded that
they could scarcely move from the loss of blood; other
noble creatures were trying on three legs to drag themselves along. After the battle the wounded men were
brought in and the dead were buried."
" And what about the wounded horses?" I said.

I said, " I have heard people talk about war as if it was

"Ah!" said he, "I should think they never saw it.
No doubt it is very fine when there is no enemy, when it
is just exercise and parade and sham fight. Yes, it is
very fine then; but when thousands of good, brave men
and horses are killed or crippled for life it has a very
different look."-)~ 202 ~/

WASHINGTON IRVING.
priv'i leg es           con vey'anCe
1. WASH:INGTON IRVING, one of the most eminent of
American authors, was born in the city of New York in
the year 1783. His father came from one of the Orkney
Islands and belonged to one of the best and oldest Scottish
families.
During the War of the Revolution Mr. and Mrs. Irving
were very kind to the American prisoners, giving them
food, clothes, and other comforts.
The Irvings were so deeply interested in the war and
the struggle for liberty that they decided to name their
boy Washington, for the great and noble man who had
done so much toward making his country free.  His-,) 208 1..mother said: " Washington's work is ended, and the child
shall be named for him."  His name was the means of
his being introduced to the Father of his Country when
he came to New York, then the seat of the government.
2. A young Scotch maid, seeing how the President was
honored, followed him into a shop and, pointing to the
boy, said: "' Please, your honor, here's a bairn was named
after you." Washington smiled at the little fellow and,
placing his hand upon the boy's head, gave him his
blessing.
Washington Irving was sent to school in his fourth
year to a Mrs. Kilmaster. He spent two years there,
but learned very little. He was then sent to a school
taught by Benjamin Romaine, who had been a soldier
in the War of the Revolution. The boy cared little for
study, but was very fond of reading.
3. When Irving was eleven years old, he became deeply
interested in books of travel. " Sinbad the Sailor" and
"Robinson Crusoe" were the first books of the kind
that awakened this feeling, and then he came across a
set of twenty volumes of voyages called "The World
Displayed." This set of books was a mine of treasure
to the boy, and he longed to visit other countries. He
explored every nook and corner of his own city and
spent his holidays in long walks about the country.
He had already shown a talent for writing, and whenBut the drowsy charm of the west wind
The leaves threw off ere long,
For they heard in the blue above them
The bright birds' tempting song.
And beneath them they saw the greensward
With its beckoning blooms, and they sighed
To be out of the lonely tree-top
Into the world so wide.
At last, after watching and waiting,
Autumn, the beautiful, came
Stepping with sandals of silver,
Decked with a mantle of flame.
Then Nature, the loving mother,
In the moony month of sheaves,
Arrayed in yellow and crimson
Her children, the forest leaves.
The leaves clapped their hands, delighted,
And shouted loud in their glee.
They sprang on the back of the north wind,
Which lifted and set them free.
Ha!'Twas a glorious riding
As they leaped along with the blast,
Frisking along over fences,
Scampering gaily and fast.-.) 204 9.he was thirteen years old, wrote a little play which was
acted at the house of one of his friends.
4. Young Irving left school when he was sixteen.
His health was poor and he cared more for reading and
exploring than for study. His two older brothers had
been sent to Columbia College, and he wished in his
afterlife that he had received the same advantages.
On leaving school, Irving joined his brother John who
was studying in a law office. He spent two years there,
but law books were only a small share of his reading.
During this time he made his first voyage up the Hudson.
There were no steamboats in those days, and he sailed on
board a sloop.
5. During this trip were planted the seeds of future
writing, for it was then that he received his first impression
of the Catskill Mountains, where is laid the scene of " Rip
Van Winkle" and "Sleepy Hollow."  He says that the
Catskill Mountains had the most witching effect on his
boyish imagination.
During this visit to his sisters, who were living in the
Hudson and Mohawk Valleys, Irving spent much time in
rambling about the forests and along the Hudson. He
thus became familiar with the country, with its legends
and old customs. Some of his best tales owe their charm
to these rambles.
6. When Irving was nineteen, he began writing for a-o8 205 8.newspaper published by his brother Peter. These articles, signed "Jonathan Oldstyle," were filled with the
same humor shown in his later writings and were copied
extensively by other newspapers.
The young author was invited the year following, in
1803, to join Judge Hoffman and a party on a journey to
Ogdensburg, Montreal, and Quebec. He gladly accepted
the invitation. They had a very exciting trip, traveling
in whatever conveyance they could find through the wild
country, meeting with Indians, sleeping in hunters'
cabins, and were once unable to get food for a whole
day.
7. The next year Irving's health failed so rapidly that
his two brothers sent him to Europe, and he sailed for
France the 19th of May, 1804. The captain as he saw
him helped on board thought he would never reach his
journey's end.
He was very heavy-hearted as the boat sailed away;
but the sea air and the thought of the new scenes before
him cheered him, and he began to gain strength. At the
end of the voyage, which was six weeks long, he was
quite able to climb the mast. Imagine his feelings as his
vessel entered the port and he saw the land of which he
had so often dreamed.
8. After two years abroad, Irving returned to New
York and became a lawyer. There was much to make-m 206 ehis return happy. He was improved in health, and the
little fame he had gained was increased by this trip.
Washington and his older brother William, together
with Mr. James K. Paulding, started a serial called
"Salmagundi." It was filled with witty articles about
the follies of the times and was very popular during its
year of publication.
9. Irving's next work was a humorous history of New
York, which is one of the wittiest books ever written.
Just before it was finished he received a blow that left
him little heart for writing. Matilda Hoffman, who was
to have been his wife, died in her eighteenth year. He
bravely went on with his work, but felt the loss so deeply
that he could never bear to speak of her. The dearest
hope of his life was overthrown.
Irving was never married, and after his death there were
found among his private papers her picture, - a sweet, girlish face, - a braid of fair hair, her Bible and prayer book,
and these words: "She died in the beauty of her youth,
and in my memory she will ever be young and beautiful."
10. In 1813 Mr. Irving edited a magazine in Philadelphia. The year following he joined the staff of General
Tompkins, and the next year he went a second time to
Europe. After spending some time in travel he was
obliged to return to his writing on account of his brothers'
failure in business.+ 207 &amp;
SUNNYSIDE, IRVING'S HOME.
He wrote "The Sketch Book" under the name of
"Geoffrey Crayon" and sent it to New York, where it
was published. It was afterwards published in London
through the influence of Sir Walter Scott, who read it
and admired it greatly.
This book met with a hearty reception in both countries. The delicate pathos and humor, the freshness of
feeling, and the refined and finished style gave it a high
position in the literary world.
11. This was in 1818. In 1822 he published "Bracebridge Hall."  This was written in Paris, where the
author was a companion of the poet Moore. It was a
success, but not so popular as "The Sketch Book." In-0 208.December, 1824, he published " The Tales of a Traveler."
These were followed, in 1828, by "The History of the
Life and Voyages of Columbus" and other works.
In 1832 he returned to America, where he was heartily
welcomed. Soon after his return he made a journey to
the country west of the Mississippi.
Washington Irving was appointed minister to Spain in
1842. He lived there four years and then came home.
His last and most elaborate work was "The Life of
Washington," in five volumes.
12. In 1835 Mr. Irving had bought an estate in Tarrytown on the Hudson.  His brother Peter and others
of his family lived there, and it was in this charming
country seat that Irving spent the last years of his life.
He called this home " The Roost," but it was re-named
"Sunnyside." The house was originally a small Dutch
cottage built of stone; but Mr. Irving remodeled and
enlarged it and planted ivy slips from Melrose Abbey
all about it.
Here, surrounded by loving relatives, Washington
Irving died on the 28th of November, 1859. His life
had been a successful one. His bright, happy nature
never deserted him, and he kept his simple tastes and
sweet temper to the last.
He was an artist in his style, and his works excite our
admiration and love,-*- 209 [&lt;RIP VAN WINKLE.

1. WIIOEVER lhas made a voyage up the Hudson must
remember the Catskill Mountains.  When the weather
is fair and settled they are
clothed in blue and purple,
and print their bold outlines
on the clear evening sky;
but sometimes, when  the:.
rest of the landscape  is        i i;
cloudless, they will gathler a
hood of gray vapors about
their summits, which, in the
last rays of the setting sun, will glow and ligllt up like
a crown of glory.
At the foot of these fairy mountains the voyager may
have descried the light smoke curling up from a village-.9 2 10 9e.whose shingle roofs gleam among the trees.  It is a
little village of great antiquity, having been founded by
some of the Dutch colonists in the early times of the
province.
In that same village and in one of these very houses
there lived many years since, while the country was yet
a province of Great Britain, a simple, good-natured fellow
of the name of Rip Van Winkle.
2. He was a great favorite among all the good wives
of the village, and the children, too, would shout with
joy whenever he approached. He made their playthings,
taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told
them long stories of ghosts, witches, and Indians.
Whenever he went dodging about the village he was
surrounded by a troop of them hanging on his skirts and
clambering on his back. Not a dog would bark at him
throughout the neighborhood.
The great error in Rip's composition was an aversion
to all kinds of profitable labor. It could not be from the
want of perseverance; for he would sit on a wet rock,
with a rod as long and heavy as a Tartar's lance, and
fish all day without a murmur, even though he should
not be encouraged by a single nibble.
3. He would carry a fowling-piece on his shoulder for
hours together, trudging through woods and swamps and
up hill and down dale, to shoot a few squirrels or wild-8 211 8+pigeons.  He would never refuse to assist a neighbor
even in the roughest toil, and was a foremost man at
all country frolics for husking Indian corn or building
stone fences.
In a word, Rip was ready to attend to anybody's
business but his own; but as to doing family duty and
keeping his farm in order, he found it impossible.
His fences were continually falling to pieces; his cow
would either go astray or get among the cabbages; weeds
were sure to grow quicker in his fields than anywhere
else; and the rain always made a point of setting in just
as he had some outdoor work to do.
4. His children, too, were as ragged and wild as if
they belonged to nobody. His son, Rip, promised to
inherit the habits with the old clothes of his father.
He was generally seen trooping like a colt at his
mother's heels, equipped in a pair of his father's cast-off
breeches, which he had much ado to hold up with one
hand, as a fine lady does her train in bad weather.
Rip Van Winkle if left to himself would have whistled
life away in perfect contentment; but his wife kept
continually dinning in his ears about his idleness, his
carelessness, and the ruin he was bringing  on his
family.
5. Rip's sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf, who
was as much henpecked as his master; for Dame Van-e  212 84Winkle regarded them as companions in idleness, and
even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye as the cause of
his master's going so often astray.
The moment Wolf entered the house, his crest fell, his
tail drooped to the ground or curled between his legs.
He sneaked about casting many a sidelong glance at
Dame Van Winkle, and at the least flourish of a broomstick or ladle he would fly to the door yelping.
6. Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle.
For a long while he used to console himself, when driven
from home, by frequenting a kind of club of idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench
before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of
his majesty George the Third.
Here they used to sit in the shade of a long, lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip or telling
endless, sleepy stories about nothing.
From even this stronghold the unlucky Rip was at
length routed by his wife, who would suddenly break in
upon the tranquillity of the assemblage and call the
members all to naught.
7. Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair,
and his only alternative to escape from the labor of the
farm and the clamor of his wife was to take gun in
hand and stroll away into the woods. Here he would
sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree and share the-.8 213 9gcontents of his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a fellow sufferer.
In a long ramble of the kind, on a fine autumnal
day, Rip had scrambled to one of the highest parts of
the Catskill Mountains.  He was after his favorite
sport of squirrel shooting, and the still solitudes had
echoed and re-echoed with the reports of his gun.
Panting and fatigued, he threw himself, late in the
afternoon, on a green knoll that crowned the brow of
a precipice.
8. From an opening between the trees he could overlook all the lower country for many a mile" of rich woodland. He saw at a distance the lordly Hudson, far, far
below him, moving on its silent but majestic course, with
the reflection of a purple cloud or the sail of a lagging
bark here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom and at
last losing itself in the blue highlands.
For some time Rip lay musing on this scene. Evening
was gradually advancing; the mountains began to throw
their long, blue shadows over the valleys. He saw that
it would be dark long before he could reach the village,
and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the terrors of Dame Van Winkle.
9. As he was about to descend he heard a voice from a
distance hallooing, " Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle! "
At the same time Wolf bristled up his back and, giving-4 7 8eA WINTER VIEW,
So sped they. At last the north wind
Began to grow chill and bleak;
Their dresses were torn and faded,
Their feet were weary and weak.
So Nature, the loving mother,
Who had watched them with many fears,
Laid them to rest on the brown earth
She had softened with her tears.
Then covered them tenderly, softly,
With snow blankets, warm and deep,Her children, tired of playing,
And weary, and full of sleep.-'. 214  9.a low growl, skulked to his master's side, looking fearfully down into the glen.
Rip looked anxiously in the same direction, and perceived
a strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks and bending
under the weight of something he carried on his back. He
was surprised to see any human being in this lonely place,
but, supposing it to be some one of the neighborhood in
need of his assistance, he hastened down to yield it.
10. On nearer approach he was still more surprised at
the stranger's appearance. He was a short, square-built
old fellow, with thick, bushy hair and a grizzled beard.
His dress was of the antique Dutch fashion,--a cloth
jerkin strapped round the waist, several pairs of breeches,
the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of
buttons down the sides, and bunches at the knees.
He bore on his shoulders a stout keg that seemed
full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to approach and
assist him  with the load.  Though rather shy and
distrustful of this new acquaintance, Rip complied with
his usual alacrity, and they clambered up a narrow gully,
apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent.
11. As they ascended, Rip every now and then heard
long, rolling peals, like distant thunder, that seemed to
issue out of a deep ravine, toward which their rugged
path conducted. Passing through the ravine, they came
to a hollow surrounded by precipices.-4215 8'During the whole time Rip and his companion had
labored on in silence; for though the former marveled
greatly what could be the object of carrying a keg of
liquor up this wild mountain, yet there was something
strange about the unknown that inspired awe and checked
familiarity.
12. On entering the hollow, new objects of wonder
presented themselves. On a level spot in the center was
a company of odd-looking personages playing at ninepins.
They were dressed in a quaint, outlandish fashion; some
wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in
their belts, and most of them had enormous breeches of
similar style to that of the guide's.
Their faces, too, were peculiar; one had a large head,
broad face, and small, piggish eyes; the face of another
seemed to consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted
by a white sugar-loaf hat, set off with a little red cock's
tail. They all had beards of various shapes and colors.
13. There was one who seemed to be the commander.
He was a stout old gentleman, with a weather-beaten
countenance; he wore a laced doublet, broad belt and
hanger, high-crowned hat and feather, red stockings, and
high-heeled shoes with roses in them.
What seemed particularly odd to Rip was that though
these folks were evidently amusing themselves, yet
they maintained the gravest faces, the most mysterious-08 216 4.silence, and were, withal, the most melancholy party of
pleasure he had ever witnessed.
Nothing interrupted the stillness of the scene but the
noise of the balls, which, whenever they were rolled,
echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of
thunder.
As Rip and his companion approached them they
stared at him with such strange, uncouth countenances
that his heart turned within him and his knees smote
together.
14. His companion now emptied the contents of the
keg into large flagons and made signs to him to wait
upon the company. He obeyed with fear and trembling;
they drank the liquor in silence, and then returned to
their game.
By degrees Rip's awe and fear subsided. He even
ventured, when no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the
beverage, which he found had much the flavor of excellent Hollands. He was naturally a thirsty soul, and was
soon tempted to repeat the draught.
One taste provoked another, and he repeated his visits
to the flagon so often that at length his eyes swam in
his head, his head gradually declined, and he fell into a
deep sleep.-48 217 9.RIP VAN WINKLE.

1. ON waking he found himself on the green knoll
from whence he had first seen the old man of the glen.
He rubbed his eyes --it was a bright, sunny morning.
The birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes,
and the eagle was wheeling aloft and breasting the pure
mountain breeze.
"Surely," thought Rip, "I have not slept here all
night." He recalled the occurrences before he fell asleep.'Oh, that wicked flagon!" thought Rip; "what excuse
shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?"
He looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean,
well-oiled fowling-piece he found an old firelock lying by
him, the barrel encrusted with rust, the lock falling off,
and the stock worm-eaten.
He now suspected that the grave jokers of the mountain had put a trick upon him and, having dosed him
with liquor, robbed him of his gun. Wolf, too, had disappeared.--Vd 2 1 8 N,RIP VAN WINKLE WAKING FROM HIS LONG SLEEP,-49 219 9.2. He determined to revisit the scene of the last evening's gambol and if he met with any of the party to demand
his dog and gun. As he rose to walk,he found himself
stiff in the joints and wanting in his usual activity.
With some difficulty he got down into the glen. He
found the gully up which he and his companion had
ascended the.preceding evening; but, to his astonishment,
a mountain stream was now foaming down it.
He, however, made shift to scramble up its sides, and at
length reached to where the ravine had opened through
the cliffs; but no trace of such opening remained. The
rocks presented a high wall, over which the torrent
came tumbling in a sheet of feathery foam. Here, then,
poor Rip was brought to a stand.
3. What was to be done? The morning was passing
away, and Rip felt famished for want of his breakfast.
He grieved to give up his dog and gun; he dreaded
to meet his wife; but it would not do to starve among
the mountains.  He shook his head, shouldered the
rusty firelock, and with a heart full of trouble and
anxiety turned his steps homeward.
As he approached the village he met a number of
people, but none whom he knew, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself acquainted with
every one in the country round. Their dress, too, was of
a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed.They all stared at him with equal marks of surprise,
and whenever they cast eyes upon him invariably stroked
their chins. This gesture induced Rip to do the same,
when, to his astonishment, he found his beard had grown
a foot long!
4. He had now entered the skirts of the village. A
troop of strange children ran at his heels, hooting after
him and pointing at his gray beard. The dogs, too, not
one of which lie recognized for an old acquaintance, barked
at him as he passed. The very village was altered.
There were rows of houses which he had never seen
before, and those which had been his familiar haunts
had disappeared.  Strange names were over the doorsstrange faces at the windows - everything was strange.
His mind now misgave him; he began to doubt whether
both he and the world around him were not bewitched.
5. It was with some difficulty that he found his way
to his own house, which he approached with silent awe,
expecting every moment to hear the shrill voice of Dame
Van Winkle. He found the house gone to decay,- the
roof fallen in, the windows shattered, and the doors off
the hinges.
He entered the house, which, to tell the truth, Dame
Van Winkle had always kept in neat order. It was
empty, forlorn, and apparently abandoned.
He now hurried forth and hastened to his old resort,the village inn; but it, too, was gone. A large, rickety
wooden building stood in its place and over the door was
painted, " The Union Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle."
Instead of the great tree that used to shelter the quiet
little Dutch inn of yore, there now was reared a tall pole
with something on the top that looked like a red nightcap, and from it was fluttering a flag on which was a
singular assemblage of stars and stripes.
6. He recognized on the sign, however, the ruby face
of King George, under which he had smoked so many a
peaceful pipe; but even this was singularly changed.
The red coat was changed for one of blue and buff, a
sword was held in the hand instead of a scepter, the head
was decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was
painted in large characters, GENERAL WASHINGTON.
There was, as usual, a crowd of folks about the door,
but none that Rip recollected. A fellow with his pockets
full of handbills was haranguing about election - members of Congress - liberty - Bunker Hill-- heroes of
seventy-six- and other words which were a perfect
jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.
7. The appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled beard,
his rusty fowling-piece, his uncouth dress, and the army
of women and children that had gathered at his heels,
soon attracted attention.
A knowing, self-important old gentleman in a sharp,
-. 221 8-.1 222 9.cocked hat made his way through the crowd, putting
them to the right and left with his elbows as he passed,
and, planting himself before Van Winkle, demanded in
an austere tone, " what brought him to the election
with a gun on his shoulder and a mob at his heels,
and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?"
8. "Alas! gentlemen," cried Rip, somewhat dismayed,
"I am a poor, quiet man, a native of the place, and a
loyal subject of the king, God bless him! "
Here a general shout burst from the bystanders: "A
tory! a tory! a spy! a refugee! hustle him! away with
him!"
It was with great difficulty that the self-important
man in the cocked hat restored order.  Rip humbly
assured him that he meant no harm, but merely came
there in search of some of his neighbors who used to
keep about the tavern.
"Well, who are they? Name them."
Rip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, "Where's
Nicholas Vedder?"
9. There was a silence for a little while, when an old
man replied in a thin, piping voice, "Nicholas Vedder?
Why, he is dead and gone these eighteen years! "
" Where's Brom Dutcher?"
" Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the
war; some say he was killed at the storming of Stony-"a 223 94.Point, others say he was drowned in the squall at the
foot of Antony's Nose. I don't know --he never came
back again."
"Where's Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?"
"He went off to the wars, too; was a great militia
general, and is now in Congress."
10. Rip's heart died away at hearing of these sad
changes in his home and friends and finding himself thus
alone in the world. Every answer puzzled him, too, by
treating of such enormous lapses of time and of matters which he could not understand; war -CongressStony Point --he had no courage to ask after any more
friends, but cried out in despair, "Does anybody here
know Rip Van Winkle?"
"Oh, Rip Van Winkle!" exclaimed two or three.
"Oh, to be sure! that's Rip Van Winkle yonder leaning
against the tree."
11. Rip looked and beheld a precise counterpart of
himself as he went up the mountain, -apparently as lazy
and certainly as ragged. The poor fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity and
whether he was himself or another man. In the midst
of his bewilderment the man in the cocked hat demanded
who he was and what was his name.
"God knows," exclaimed he, at his wit's end; "4 I'm

THIS charming selection is taken from 1"Jackanapes," a quaint
and interesting story for children. It was writtenr by Mrs. Ewing,
who died in 1885, at the age of forty-four. The writings of this
lady, who contributed so extensively to English juvenile literature,
under the name of "Aunt Judy," have become popular in America
as well as in her own country. "Jackanapes " is her best literary
work and made her name famous. The book as a whole is delightful

1. IT was after the Fair that Jackanapes, out rambling
by himself, was knocked over by the Gypsy's son riding
the Gypsy's red-haired pony at breakneck pace across the
common.
Jackanapes got up and shook himself, none the worse
except for being heels over head'in love with the redhaired pony.  What a rate he went at! How he spurned
the ground with his nimible feet!  How  his red coat
shone in the sunshine! And what bright eyes peeped
out of his dark forelock as it was blown by the wind!

12. At this critical moment a fresh, comnely woman
passed through the throng to get a peep at the graybearded man.  She had a chubby child in her arms,
which, frightened at his looks, began to cry. "Hush,
Rip," cried she, "hush; the old man won't hurt you."
The name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone
of her voice all awakened a train of recollections in his
mind.
"What is your name, my good woman? " asked he.
"Judith Gardenier."
"And your father's name?"
"Ah, poor man, his name was Rip Van W'inkle; it's
twenty years since he went away from home with his
gun and never has been heard of since. His dog came
home without him; but whether he shot himself or was
carried away by the Indians nobody can tell. I was then
but a little girl."
13. Rip had but one question more to ask; but he put
it with a faltering voice -
" Where's your mother?."
"Oh, she, too, had died but a short time since."
The honest man could contain himself no longer. He
caught his daughter and her child in his arms. "I am-.0 225 9eyour father! " cried he. "Young Rip Van Winkle once,
old Rip Van Winkle now. Does nobody know poor Rip
Van Winkle?"
All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out
from among the crowd, put her hand to her brow, and,
peering under it in his face for a moment, exclaimed,
"Sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle--it is himself.
Welcome home again, old neighbor. Why, where have
you been these twenty long years?"
Rip's story was soon told, for the whole twenty years
had been to him but as one night. The neighbors stared
when they heard it; some were seen to wink at each
other and put their tongues in their cheeks, and the
self-important man in the cocked hat screwed down the
corners of his mouth andwqhook his head.
14. It was determined, however, to take the opinion
of old Peter Vanderdonk, who was seen slowly advancing up the road.  He recollected Rip at once and corroborated his story in the most satisfactory manner.
He assured the company that it was a fact handed
down from his ancestor, the historian, that the Catskill
Mountains had always been haunted by strange beings.
That it was affirmed that the great Hendrick Hudson,
the first discoverer of the river and country, kept a kind
of vigil there every twenty years with his crew of the
Half-moon, being permitted in this way to revisit the-a8 226 -
scenes of his enterprise and keep a guardian eye upon
the river and the great city called by his name.
That his father had seen them in their old Dutch
dresses playing at ninepins in the hollow of the mountain; and that he himself had heard one summer afternoon the sound of their balls like distant peals of thunder.
15. Rip's daughter took him home to live with' her,
and he resumed his old walks and habits.
He took his place once more on the bench at the inn
door and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the
village. It was some time before he could be made to
comprehend the strange events that had taken place.
How there had been a revolutionary war--that the
country had thrown off the yoke of old England- and
that, instead of being a subject of his majesty George the
Third, he was now a free citizen of the United States.
16. He used to tell his story to every stranger that
arrived at the hotel. He was observed at first to vary
on some points every time he told it, which was doubtless
owing to his having so recently awakened. Some always
pretended to doubt the reality of it and insisted that Rip
had been out of his head.
The old Dutch inhabitants, however, almost universally
gave it full credit. Even to this day they never hear a
thunder storm about the Catskill but they say Hendrick
Hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins.-l.* 227 7POCAHONTAS.
BY WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.
ONE of the most eminent novelists of our time was William
M. Thackeray, who was born in Calcutta in 1811.  His father left
him a large fortune, which enabled the future author to secure
an university education. Although Thackeray's first ambition was
to become an artist, he devoted him-             W Y
self to literature after the loss of his
fortune.  He wrote for many years
before he gained a reputation, but at  
last his great novels, "Pendennis,"
"Henry Esmond," and "The Newcomes," secured for him the highest,
rank among the great masters of fic-:i:
No writer of his time had such a:
command of English, and his language'::
is full of purity and strength.''":
Thackeray had a wonderful insight into human nature. He had
no patience for falsehood or wrong; but there was a world of tenderness and sympathy in his heart.
Thackeray was highly respected and deeply beloved for his rare
personal qualities.  He died on the morning of December 24,
1863.
WEARIED arm and broken sword

Who will shield the captive knight?

Fondly to his heart she clings,
And her bosom guards his life!-.P 229 &amp;In the woods of Powhatan,

RAIN  IN THE GARRET.
By DONALD GRANT MITCHELL.
DONALD G. MITCHELL, widely known by his pen-name of "Ik
Mar-vel," was born in Norwich, Conn., in April, 1822. Not being
very robust, he was sent for a few years to his grandfather's farm.
The farm life interested him greatly, and he loved the country.
The breadth of a country life
was a delight to him. He says,
"In the fields of God's planting
there is room. The boy grows
to manliness instead of growing
to be like men."
In 1841 he graduated at Yale
College. Three years later he    t
went to England, traveling
through every county on foot,  
and wrote letters about his trip
for the newspapers.
On his return he wrote a book
of travels. A few years later he went abroad again, and wrote a
second book of travel. His most popular works are " Dream Life "
and " Reveries of a Bachelor."
In 1853 he was sent as consul to Venice. He returned in 1855
and bought a beautiful farm near New Haven, Conn., which he
called Edgewood.-'1 230 e.There he leads a happy life, enjoying his home and writing.
His books are full of beauty and grace, and the later writings are
strong, healthful, with a dash of wit and fun.
The following selection is from " Dream Life," and is probably
one of Mr. Mitchell's memories of the days spent in the old
farmhouse where his grandfather lived.
Mr. Mitchell wrote a book for children called "Among Old Story
Tellers," which is very interesting.

1. IT is an old garret with big brown rafters, and the
boards between are stained with the rainstorms of fifty
years.   And as the sportive April shower quickens its
flood, it seems as if its torrents would come dashing
through the shingles upon you and upon your play. But
it will not, for you know that the old roof is strong.
You love that old garret roof, and you nestle down
under its slope with a sense of its protecting power that
no castle walls can give to your maturer years.
It seems a grand old place, and it is capital fun to
search in its corners and drag out some bit of quaint old
furniture with a leg broken, and lay a cushion across it,
and fix your reins upon the lion's claws of the feet, and
then - gallop away!
And you offer sister Nelly a chance if she will be
good; and throw  out very patronizing words to little-..0 23 1  e.Charlie, who is mounted upon a much humbler horse--
as he of right should be, since he is three years your
junior.
2. I know no nobler forage ground for a romantic,
venturesome, mischievous boy than the garret of an old
family mansion on a day of storm. It is a perfect field of
chivalry.
The heavy rafters, the dashing rain, the piles of spare
mattresses to carouse upon, the big trunks to hide in,
the old white coats and hats hanging in obscure corners
like ghosts - are great!
There is great fun in groping through a tall barrel of
books and pamphlets, on the lookout for startling pictures; and there are chestnuts in the garret, drying,
which you have discovered on a ledge of the chimney,
and you slide a few into your pocket and munch themn
quietly -giving now and then one to Nelly and begging
her to keep silent, for you have a great fear of its being
forbidden fruit.
3.. But you grow tired of this; you tire even of the
swing and of the pranks of Charlie, and you glide away
into a corner with an old dog's-eared copy of "Robinson
Crusoe."
And you grow heart and soul into the story, until
you tremble for the poor fellow with his guns behind
the palisade, and are yourself half dead with fright when-N 232 &amp;A RAINY DAY IN THE GARRET.
you peep cautiously over
the hill with your glass and
see the cannibals around
the fire.
Yet, after all, you think
the old fellow must have
had a capital time with a
whole island to himself;
and you think you would like such a time yourself, if
only Nelly and Charlie could be there with you.
But this thought does not come till afterward; for the
time you are nothing but Crusoe-you are living in his
cave with Poll the parrot and are looking out for your
goats and man Friday..    233 804. You dream what a nice thing it would be for you to
slip away some pleasant morning - not to York, as young
Crusoe did, but to New York --and take passage as a
sailor; and how, if they knew you were going, there
would be such a world of good-byes, and how, if they
did not know it, there would be such a world of wonder!
And then the sailor's dress would be altogether such a
jaunty affair, and it would be such rare sport to lie off
upon the yards far aloft, as you have seen sailors in
pictures looking out upon the blue and tumbling sea.
No thought now in your boyish dreams of sleety storms
and cables stiffened with ice and crashing spars and great
icebergs towering fearfully around you!
5. You would have better luck than even Crusoe; you
would save a compass and a Bible and stores of hatchets
and the captain's dog and great puncheons of sweetmeats
(which Crusoe altogether overlooked); and you would
save a tent or two, which you could set up on the shore,
and an American flag and a small piece of cannon, which
you could fire as often as you liked.
At night you would sleep in a tree--though you
wonder how Crusoe did it - and would say the prayers
you had been taught to say at home, and fall to sleep,
dreaming of Nelly and Charlie.
6. At sunrise, or thereabouts, you would come down,
feeling very much refreshed, and make a very nice break-46 9 8anapes for not having been hurt, by consenting to let
him have a ride.
"Do you mean to kill the little fine gentleman?"
screamed the Gypsy mother, who came up just as Jackanapes and the pony set off.
"He would get on," replied her son. "It'll not kill
him. He'll fall on his yellow head, and it's as tough as
a cocoanut."
3. But Jackanapes did not fall. He stuck to the redhaired pony; but, oh, the delight of this wild gallop with
flesh and blood! Just as his legs were beginning to feel
as if he did not feel them, the Gypsy boy cried, "Lollo!"
Round went the pony.
Jackanapes clung to his neck; and he did not properly
recover himself before Lollo stopped with a jerk, at the
place where they had started.
4. " Is his name Lollo? " asked Jackanapes, his hand
lingering in the wiry mane.
" Yes."
" What does Lollo mean?
"Red."
"Is Lollo your pony?"
"No. My father's." And the Gypsy boy led Lollo
away.
5. At the first opportunity Jackanapes stole away again
to the common. This time he saw the Gypsy father.-- 234 9fast off of smoked herring and sea-bread with a little
currant jam and a few oranges. After this you would
haul ashore a chest or two of the sailor's clothes, and,
putting a few large jackknives in your pocket, would take
a stroll over the island and dig a cave somewhere and roll
in a cask or two of sea-bread.
And you fancy yourself growing after a time very tall
and wearing a magnificent goatskin cap trimmed with
green ribbons and set off with a plume. You think you
would have put a few more guns in than Crusoe did and
charged them with a little more grape.
7. After a long while, you fancy, a ship would arrive
which would carry you back, and you count upon very
great surprise on the part of your father and little Nelly
as you march up to the door of the old family mansion
with plenty of gold in your pocket and a small bag of
cocoanuts for Charlie, and with a great deal of pleasant
talk about your island far away in the south seas.
And so, with your head upon your hand, in your quiet,
garret corner, over some such beguiling story, your
thought leans away from the book into your own dreamy
cruise over the sea of life.-49 235 ecTHE SEA VOYAGE.
By JOSIAH GILBERT HOLLAND.
From " Arthur Bonnicastle." Copyright, 1882, by Charles Scribner's Sons.
JOSIAH G. HOLLAND, widely known by the pen-name of
"Trimothy Titcomb," was born July, 1819, in a Massachusetts
village called Belchertown. He began life as a doctor, but after
a few years of practice gave up this
profession and went to Vicksburg as
superintendent of schools.
From this city he went to Springfield, Mass., and became an editor of
"The Springfield  Republican."   He
wrote first for the papers, but soon
devoted more time to general literary.   
work. He wrote a number of novels,
two very popular poems, "Bitter Sweet"
and "Kathrina," and several volumes of
essays.
In 1870 he became editor of " Scribner's Monthly" in New York.
Dr. Holland was a delightful man and made many friends. His
novels are very interesting as stories. They contain many pictures
of village life, and the thought and lessons taught by them are
strong and helpful.  His numerous essays, first published in
periodicals and afterwards in book form, are widely read. They
are full of homely wisdom and kindly advice.
Dr. Holland died in 1881.
The following selection is taken from "Arthur Bonnicastle,"'
one of Holland's best novels.
Arthur, the hero of the book, was visiting a lady who was very
fond of him.  He and Jenks, the stable man, were friends,
although his eccentric hostess did not know of their friendship.-- 236 -

1. AFTER dinner I asked liberty to go to the stable.
I was fond of horses and all domestic animals. I made
my request in the presence of Jenks, and that old hypocrite had the hardihood to growl and grumble and mutter.
I looked at him inquiringly.
"Don't mind Jenks," said Madame.
Jenks went growling out of the room, but as he passed
me I caught the old cunning look in his little eyes and
followed him. When the door was closed he cut a pigeonwing, and ended by throwing one foot entirely over my
head.
Then he whispered: "' You go out and stay there until
I come. Don't disturb anything." So I went out, thinking him quite the queerest old fellow I had ever seen.
2. I passed half an hour patting the horse's head,
calling the chickens around me, and wondering what the
plans of Jenks would be. At length he appeared. Walking tiptoe into the stable, he said: "The old woman is
down for a nap, and we've got two good hours for a
voyage. Now, messmate, let's up sails and be off! "
At this he seized a long rope which depended from one
of the great beams above, and pulled away with a "Yo!
heave, oh!" (letting it slide through his hands at every-.  237  9.call), as if an immense spread of canvas were to be the
result.
"Belay there!" he said at last, in token that his ship
was under way and the voyage begun.
"It's a bit cold, my hearty, and now for a turn on the
quarter-deck," he said, as he grasped my hand and
walked with me back and forth across the floor. I was
seized with a fit of laughter, but walked with him, nothing
loth. "Now we plow the billow," said Jenks; "this is
what I call gay."
3. After giving our blood a jog and getting into a
glow, he began to laugh.
"What are you laughing at?" I inquired.
"She made me promise that I would n't tease or trouble
you, she' did! " and then he laughed again. Then he
suddenly sobered, and suggested that it was time to
examine our chart. Dropping my hand, he went to a
bin of oats, built like a desk and opening from the top
with a falling lid.
Then he brought forth two three-legged milking-stools
and placed them before it, and, plunging his hand deep
down into the oats drew out my atlas neatly wrapped
in an old newspaper.  This he opened before me, and
we took our seats.
" Now where are we? " said Jenks.
4. I opened to the map of the world, and said: "Here-~ 238 9eis New York and there is Boston. We can't be very far
from either of'em, but I think we are between'em."
"Very well; let it be between'em," said Jenks.
"Now what?"
"Where will you go?" I inquired.
"I don't care where I go; let us have a big sail now
that we are in for it," he replied.
"Well, then, let's go to Great Britain," I said.
"Is n't there something that they call the English
Channel?" inquired Jenks with a doubtful look.
"Yes, there is," and, cruising about among the fine
type, I found it.
"Well, I don't like this idea of being out of sight of
land. It's dangerous, and if you can't sleep there is no
place to go to.  Let's steer straight for the English
Channel."
5. "But it will take a month," I said; "I have heard
people say so a great many times."
"My!  A month?  Out of sight of land?  Hey de
diddle! Very well, let it be a month. Hullo! it's all
over! Here we are; now where are we on the map?"
"We seem to be pretty near to Paris," I said, "but we
don't quite touch it. There must be some little places
along here that are not put down. There's London, too;
that does n't seem to be a great way off, but there's a
strip of land between it and the water."-. 289  4"Why, yes, there's Paris," said Jenks, looking out of
the stable window and down upon the town. " Don't you
see? It's a fine city. I think I see just where Napoleon
Bonaparte lives. But it's a wicked place; let's get away
from it. Bear off now"; and so our imaginary bark, to
use Jenks' large phrase, v" swept up the Channel."
6. Here I suggested that we had better take a map of
Great Britain, and we should probably find more places
to stop at. I found it easily with the "English Channel"
in large letters.
"Here we are! " I said; "' see the towns!"
"My! Ain't they thick! " responded Jenks. "What is
that name running lengthwise there right through the
water?"
"That's the' Strait of Dover,'" I replied.
"Well, then, look out! We're running right into it!
It's a narrow place, anyway. Bear away there; take
the middle course. I've heard of the Straits of Dover
before. They are dangerous; but we're through, we're
through. Now where are we?"
"We are right at the mouth of the Thames," I replied,
"and here is a river that leads straight up to London."
7. "CCruise off! cruise off!" said Jenks. "'We're in
an enemy's country. Sure enough, there's London "; and
he looked out of the window with a fixed gaze as if the
dome of St. Paul's were as plainly in sight as his own nose.-48 240 8w.After satisfying himself with a survey of the great city,
he remarked interrogatively, "Have n't we had about
~ enough of this? I want to go where the spicy breezes blow.
Now that we have got our sea-legs on let us make for the
~{ equator. Bring the ship round; here we go; now what?"
8. "We have got to cross the Tropic of Cancer, for all
that I can see," said I.
"Can't we possibly dodge it?" inquired Jenks, with
concern.
"I don't see how we can," I replied. "It seems to go
clean around."
"What is it, anyway?" said he.
"It does n't seem to be anything but a sort of dotted
line," I answered.
" Oh, well, never mind; we'11 get along with that," he
said encouragingly. "Steer between two dots."
9. Here Jenks covered his mouth and nose, and held
them until the danger was past. At last, with a red face,
he inquired, " Are we over?"
"All over," I replied; "now where do you want to go?"
"Is n't there something that they call the Channel of
Mozambique?" said Jenks.
"Why?" I asked.'" Well, I've always thought it must be a splendid sheet
of water! Yes; Channel of Mozambique - splendid sheet
of water! Mozambique! Grand name, is n't it?"-48 241 13f10. " Why, here it is," said I, "away round here.
We've got to run down the coast of Africa and around
the Cape of Good Hope and up into the Indian Ocean.
Shall we touch anywhere?"
" No, I reckon it is n't best. The natives will think
we are after'em and we may get into trouble. But look
here, boy! We've forgot the compasses. How we ever
managed to get across the Atlantic without'em is more
than I know. That's one of the carelessest things I ever
did. I don't suppose we could do it again in trying a
thousand times."
Thereupon he drew from a corner of the oat-bin an
old pair of carpenter's compasses, between which and the
mariner's compass neither he nor I knew the difference,
and said: "Now let us sail by compasses in the regular
wa,y.
"How do you do it?" I inquired.
11. " There can't be but one way, as I see," he replied.
"You put one leg down on the map where you are, then
put the other down where you want to go and just sail
for that leg."
"Well," said I, "here we are, close to the Canary
Islands.  Put one leg down there and the other down
here at St. Helena."
After considerable questioning and fumbling and adjusting of the compasses, they were held in their place-.-  242 9'while we drove for the lonely island. After a considerable
period of silence, Jenks broke out with: "Does n't she
cut the water beautiful?"
"Here we are," he exclaimed at last.'Now let's
double over and start again.".........' "
ARTHUR AND JENKS ON THEIR OCEAN VOYAGE.
12. So the northern leg came round with a half circle
and went down at the Cape of Good Hope. The Tropic
of Capricorn proved less dangerous than the northern
corresponding line, and so, at last, sweeping around the
Cape, we brought that leg of the compasses which we had
left behind toward the equator again, and, working up on
the map, arrived at our destination.-.9 243!3."Well, here we are in the Channel of Mozambique," I
said.
"What's that blue place there on the right-hand side
of it?" he inquired.
"That's the Island of Madagascar."
"You don't tell me!" he exclaimed. "Well! I never
expected to be so near that place. The Island of Madagascar! The Island of Mad-a-gas-car! Let's take a look
at it."
13. Thereupon he rose and took a long look out of the
window.  " Elephants - mountains - tigers - monkeys
-golden sands  cannibals," he exclaimed slowly. Then
he elevated his nose and began to sniff the air as if some
far-off odor had reached him on viewless wings. "Spicy
breezes, upon my word!" he exclaimed.  "Don't you
notice'em, boy? Smell uncommonly like hay; what do
you think?"
We had after this a long and interesting cruise, running into various celebrated ports and gradually working
toward home.  I was too busy with the navigation to
join Jenks in his views of the countries and islands which
we passed on the voyage, but he enjoyed every league of
the long and eventful sail. At last Jenks cast anchor by
dropping a huge stone through a trapdoor in the floor.
14. "It really seems good to be at home again and to
feel everything standing still, does n't it? " said he. "I-1 1084'"Lollo is your pony, is n't he?" said Jackanapes.
" Yes."
" He's a very nice one."
"I-He's a racer."
"You don't want to sell him, do you?"
6. "Fifteen pounds," said the Gypsy father; and Jackanapes sighed and went home again. That very afternoon he and Tony rode the two donkeys; and Tony
managed to get thrown, and even Jackanapes' donkey
kicked. But it was jolting, clumsy work after the elastic
swiftness and the dainty mischief of the red-haired pony.
7. A few days later, Miss Jessamnine spoke very seriously to Jackanapes. She told him that his grandfather,
the General, was coming to the Green, and that he must
be on his very best behavior during the visit.
What mischief could be foreseen, Jackanapes promised to guard against. He was to keep his clothes and
his hands clean, not to put sticky things in his pockets,
to be sure to say'" sir " to the General, and to be careful
about rubbing his shoes on the door-mat. The General
arrived; and for the first day all went well.
8. Jackanapes began to feel at ease with his grandfather, and disposed to talk confidentially with him, as
he did with the postman. All that the General felt, it
would take too long to tell; but he was disposed to talk
confidentially with Jackanapes.-e 244:,wonder if I can walk straight," he went on, and then
proceeded to ascertain by actual experiment.
I have laughed a hundred tiines since at the recollection of the old fellow's efforts to adapt himself to the
imaginary billows of the stable floor.
-I enjoyed the play quite as well as my companion
did, but even then I did not comprehend that it was
simply play with him. I supposed it was a trick of his
to learn something of geography before cutting loose from
service and striking out into the great world by way of
the ocean. So I said to him: "What do you do this
for?"
"What do I do it for? What does anybody go to sea
for?" he inquired, with astonishment.
"Well, but you don't go to the real sea, you know," I
suggested.
15. "Don't I! That's what the atlas says, anyway,
and the atlas ought to know," said Jenks. "At any rate,
it's as good a sea as I want at this time of year, just
before winter comes on. If you only think so, it's a
great deal better sailing on an atlas than it is sailing on
the water. You have only to go a few inches and you
need n't get wet and you can't drown.
"You can see everything there is in the world by looking out of the window and thinking you do; and what's
the use spending so much time as people do traveling--) 245 9to the ends of the earth? If I could.only have had a
real sail on the ocean and got through with it, I don't
know but I should be ready to die."
"But you will have some time, you know," I said
encouragingly.
"Do you think so?"
"When you run away you will," I said.
"I don't know," he responded dubiously.  "I think
perhaps I'd better run away on an atlas a few times first,
just to learn the ropes."

BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON was born November 30, 1850, at Edinburgh, Scotland, within sight of the great Edinburgh Castle.
His father and grandfather were famous lighthouse engineers.
He was proud, when a boy, to think of his father as the builder
of the great sea lights along the northern coast of Great Britain.
He liked to think of the sailors that were watching far out on the
ocean for the first glimpse of the rays they flashed.
Robert expected to follow the same profession; but he was not
strong, and soon learned that he would never be able to become
an engineer. He was fond of rambling about the wild Scottish
coast, and often made sketches of it.-  246 8(The Stevensons had a beautiful country home at Swanston, and
there he spent many happy days. He was an "awful laddie for
asking questions," said an old Scotchman of Swanston, 1" and when your back
is turned he goes and writes it down."
He took a course at the University:of Edinburgh, and later studied law,
but gave it up because of his ill health.
He was a great reader and especially
/ fond of the writings of Charles Dickens.
After giving up law he went to France,
J:    fwhere he studied art, and there began
to write for the magazines.
A large part of his life was spent in
traveling. He journeyed through the mountains of France, driving
a donkey to carry his camp-kit, paddled a canoe through the canals
of Holland, hunted and fished in the Adirondacks, crossed America
with an emigrant train, and sailed amoiig the islands of the
Pacific.
In 1879 he went to California for his health, and made his home
in that state for some years.
His life so full of adventure and his wonderful power and
genius as a writer soon placed him among the foremost of modern
authors.  One of them calls him " the dear king of us all."
In 1887 he built a beautiful home on the Island of Samoa. The
house was on the side of a mountain, and as he looked up from its
broad veranda he could see the great forests, and tiny silver waterfalls glistening among the foliage.
The dull roaring of the breakers as they dashed against the coral
reefs which formed the island never ceased, and the sound came
softly up to the house a thousand feet from the Shore.
And there, within sight and sound of the sea, so dear to him,

1. THE mill where Will lived with his adopted parents
stood in a falling valley between pine woods and great
mountains. A long gray village lay some way up like a
seam, or a rag of vapor on a wooded hillside; and when
the wind was favorable the sound of the church bells
would drop down, thin and silvery, to Will.
Below, the valley grew ever steeper and steeper and at
the saime time widened out on either hand.  From an
eminence beside the mill it was possible to see its whole
length and away beyond it over a wide plain where the
river turned and shone and moved on from city to city
on its voyage toward the sea.
2. It chanced that over this valley there lay a pass
into a neighboring kingdom. All through the summer
traveling carriages came crawling up or went plunging
briskly downward past the mill; and, as it happened that
the other side was very much easier of ascent, the path
was not much frequented except by people going in one
direction.
Of all the carriages that Will saw go by, five-sixths
were plunging briskly downward and only one-sixth
crawling up.-.8 248 9.Much more was this the case with foot passengers.
All the light-footed tourists, all the peddlers laden with
strange wares were tending downward, like the river that
accompanied their path.
3. Whither had they all gone? Whither went all the
tourists and peddlers with strange wares? Whither the
water of the stream, ever coursing downward and ever
renewed from above?
Even the wind blew oftener down the valley, and
carried the dead leaves along with it in the fall. They
all went downward, fleetly and gayly downward, and
only he, it seemed, remained behind like a stock upon
the wayside.
It sometimes made him glad when he noticed how the
fishes kept their heads upstream. They, at least, stood
faithfully by him while all else were posting downward
to the unknown world.
4. One evening he asked the miller where the river
went.
"It goes down the valley," answered he, "and turns a
power of mills - six score mills, they say - and is none
the wearier after all. And then it goes out into the lowlands and waters the great corn country and runs through
a sight of fine cities (so they say) where kings live all
alone in great palaces, with a sentry walking up anddown before the door.-08 249 9e"And it goes under bridges with stone men upon them
looking down and smiling so curious at the water, and
living folks leaning their elbows on the wall and looking
over, too.
"And then it goes on and on and down through marshes
and sands, until at last it falls into the sea where the ships
are that bring parrots and tobacco from the Indies. Ay,
it has a long trot before it as it goes singing over our
weir, bless its heart!"
5. "And what is the sea?" asked Will.
"The sea!" cried the miller. "Lord help us all, it
is the greatest thing God made! That is where all the
water in the world runs down into a great salt lake.
"There it lies as flat as my hand and as innocent-like as
a child; but they do say when the wind blows it gets up
into water mountains bigger than any of ours and swallows down great ships bigger than our mill and makes such
a roaring that you can hear it miles away upon the land."
From that day forward Will was full of new hopes
and longings.  Something kept tugging at his heartstrings; the running water carried his desires along with
it as he dreamed, over its fleeting surface.
6. He spent long whiles on the hilltop looking down the
river shed and abroad on the flat lowlands, and watched
the clouds that traveled forth upon the sluggish wind and
trailed their purple shadows on the plain. He would&lt;-. 250 -
linger by the wayside and follow the carriages with his
eyes as they rattled downward by the river.
It did not matter what it was; everything that went
that way, were it cloud or carriage, bird or brown water
in the stream, he felt his heart flow out after it in an
ecstasy of longing.
Bit by bit he pieced together broken notions of the
world below: of the river, ever moving and growing until
it sailed forth into the majestic ocean; of the cities, full
of brisk and beautiful people, playing fountains, bands of
music and marble palaces, and lighted up at night from
end to end with artificial stars of gold.
7. The true life, the true, bright sunshine lay far out
upon the plain. And, oh! to see this sunlight once before
he died! to hear the trained singers and sweet church
bells and see the holiday gardens!
"And oh, fish!" he would cry, "if you would only
turn your noses downstream, you could swim so easily
into the fabled waters and see the vast ships passing over
your head like clouds, and hear the great water hills
making music over you all day long! "
But the fish kept looking patiently in their own direction, until Will hardly knew whether to laugh or cry.
8. A time came at last when this was to be changed.
The miller turned the mill house into a little wayside
inn. It now became Will's duty to wait upon people asthey sat to break their fasts in the little arbor at the top
of the mill garden; and you may be sure that he kept his
ears open and learned many new things about the outside
world.
One day, when-Will was about sixteen, a young man
arrived at sunset to pass the night. He was a contentedlooking fellow with a jolly eye, and carried a knapsack.
While dinner was preparing he sat in the arbor to read a
book; but as soon as he had begun to observe Will, the
book was laid aside.
Will soon began to take a great deal of pleasure in
his talk, which was full of good nature and good sense,
and at last conceived a great respect for his character
and wisdom.
9. They sat far into the night; and Will opened his
heart to the young man and told him how he longed to
leave the valley and what bright, hopes he had connected
with the cities of the plain. The young man whistled
and then. broke into a smile.
"My young friend," he remarked, "you are a very
curious little fellow, to be sure, and wish a great many
things which you will never get. Why, you would feel
quite ashamed if you knew how the little fellows in these
fairy cities of yours are all after the same sort of nonsense and keep breaking their hearts to get up into the
mountains.
--)B   2      1  S-C-8 252 8'"And, let me tell you, those who go down into the
plains are a very short while there before they heartily
wish themselves' back again.  The air is not so light
nor so pure; nor is the sun any brighter.  As for the
beautiful men and women, you would see many of them
in rags."
10. "You must think me very simple," answered Will.
"Although I have never been out of this valley, believe
me, I have used my eyes. I do not expect to find all
things right in your cities. That is not what troubles
me. But you would not have me die and not see all that
is to be seen and do all that a man can do? You would
not have me spend all my days between this road here
and the river, and not so much as make a motion to be
up and live my life?"
"Thousands of people," said the young man, "live and
die like you and are none the less happy."
"Ah! " said Will, "if there are thousands who would
like, why should not one of them have my place?"
11. It was quite dark; there was a hanging lamp in
the arbor which lighted up the table and the faces of the
speakers, and along the arch the leaves upon the trellis
stood out, illuminated against the night sky, a pattern of
transparent green upon a dusky purple.
The young man rose, and, taking Will by the arm, led
him out under the open heavens.-.8 258 8""Did you ever look at the stars? " he asked, pointing
upward.  
"Often and often," answered Will.
"And do you know what they are?"
"I have fancied many things."
"They are worlds like ours," said the young man.
"Some of them less; many of them a million times
greater; and some of the least sparkles that you see are
not only worlds, but whole clusters of worlds turning
about each other in the midst of space.
12. "We do not know what there may be in any of
them,--perhaps the answer to all our difficulties or
the cure of all our sufferings; and yet we can never
reach them. Not all the skill of the craftiest of men
can fit out a ship for the nearest of these our neighbors, nor would the life of the most aged suffice for
such a journey.
"When a great battle has been lost or a dear friend
is dead, there they are unweariedly shining overhead.
We may stand down here, a whole army of us together,
and shout until we break our hearts and not a whisper
reaches them. We may climb the highest mountain and
we are no nearer them."
Will hung his head a little and then raised it once
more to heaven. The stars seemed to expand and emit a
sharper brilliancy; and, as he kept turning his eyes- 1e 11
"A pretty place this," he said, looking out of the lattice
on to the Green, where the grass was vivid with sunset
and the shadows were long and peaceful.
9. "You should see it in Fair week, sir," said Jackanapes, shaking his yellow mop, and leaning back in his
one of the two arm-chairs in which they sat.
"A fine time that, eh?" said the General, with a
twinkle in his eye.
Jackanapes shook his hair once more. "I enjoyed this
last one the best of all," he said. " I'd so much money."
"Indeed, it's not a common complaint in these bad
times. How much had ye?"
"I'd two shillings. A new shilling aunty gave me,
and elevenpence I had saved up, and a penny from the
postman."
10. "You don't want money except at Fair times, I
suppose? " said the General.
Jackanapes shook his head.
"If I could have as much as I want, I should know
what to buy," said he.
"And how much do you want, if you could get it?"
11. "Wait a minute, sir, till I think what twopence
froin fifteen pounds leaves. Two from nothing you can't,
but borrow twelve. Two from twelve, ten, and carry
one. Please remember ten, sir, when I ask you. One
from  nothing you can't, borrow  twenty. One from-*f1 254 St.higher and higher, they seemed to increase in multitude
under his gaze.
13. One day after dinner Will took a stroll among the
firs. He kept smiling to himself and the landscape as he
went. The river ran between the stepping-stones with
a pretty wimple; a bird sang loudly in the wood.
His way took him to the eminence which overlooked
the plain; and there he sat down upon a stone and fell
into deep and pleasant thought.
The plain lay abroad with its cities and silver river;
everything was asleep except a great eddy of birds which
kept rising and falling and going round and round in the
blue air.  The river might run forever; the birds fly
higher and higher till they touched the stars.
He saw it was empty bustle, after all; for here, without stirring a foot, waiting patiently in his own narrow
valley, he also had attained the better sunlight.-68 255 96THE CLOUD.

BY PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY.
PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY was the son of a wealthy English
baronet, and was born in Sussex, England, in 1792.
He led a somewhat roving life, but is said to have been upright
and generous.
Shelley is best known through some of his shorter poems. "The
Cloud,"'"To the Skylark," and "The Sensitive Plant" are filled
with pictures and overflow with beauty of thought and language.
The poet was drowned in the Bay of Spezzia in 1822.
I BRING fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
From the seas and the streams;
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
In their noonday dreams.
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
The sweet birds, every one,
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
As she dances about the sun.
I wield the flail of the laslhing hail,
And whiten the green plains under;
And then again I dissolve it in rain,
And laugh as I pass in thunder.
I sift the snow on the mountains below,
And their great pines groan aghast;--n 256 8&amp;And all the night't is my pillow white,
While I sleep in the arms of the blast.
Sublime on the towers of skyey bowers
Lightning, my pilot, sits;
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder;
It struggles and howls by fits;
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,
This pilot is guiding me.
That orbed maiden, with white fire laden,
Whom mortals call the moon,
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,
By the midnight breezes strewn;
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,
Which only the angels hear,
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,
The stars peep behind her and peer;
And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,
Like a swarm of golden bees,
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent
Till the calm river, lakes, and seas,
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,
Are each paved with the moon and these.-.u 257 9@TOM, THE WATER BABY, MAKES FRIENDS.
BY CHARLES KINGSLEY.
A LITTLE village, called Holne, in England, was the early home
of Charles Kingsley. His father was the rector there, and was
also somewhat of an artist and sportsman. Charles was like him, but had
the force and romance of his mother.
When Charles was eleven years old
the family removed to Clovelly, on the
coast. Here Charles and his brothers
had their boat and ponies and began                        I!
to study natural history. In the little.:
story of the "Water Babies," from /-:;:
which this selection has been made,
he tells some of the wonderful changes
which take place in the water.
The rector's parish was largely made up of fishermen's families,
and when the fishing fleets went out to sea, Mr. Kingsley, his wife,
and the boys always went to the quay to hold a short service,
where they all joined in singing the one hundred and twenty-first
psalm. Kingsley's poem of the " Three Fishers " is a picture from
real life.
After his education was finished, Charles became a rector also
and went to Evely, which was his home for thirty years.  In
addition to his parish work he wrote a number of books which
made him famous.
Several years were spent in travel, and, among other places, he
visited America. The climate in this country delighted him, and
he enjoyed meeting Mr. Longfellow and other literary men.
On his return to England he found much sickness among his
people, and he overworked in caring for them. The serious illness
of his wife was too great a shock for him iu his feeble health, and
he died in Decemiber, 1874.-8 258 -

1. TOM  was a poor little chimney sweep.  He was
treated unkindly by his master and was always dirty
and black.  One day when he was very hungry and
thirsty he longed to go to the river, and bathe in it.
He could hear it sing:
"Clear and cool, clear and cool,
By laughing shallow and dreaming pool;
Cool and clear, cool and clear,
By shilling shingle and foaming weir;
Under the crag where the ousel sings,
And the ivied wall where the church bell rings,
Undefiled for the undefiled,
Play by me, bathe in me, mother and child."
2. Tom was so hot and thirsty and longed so to be
clean for once that he tumbled himself as quick as he
could into the clear, cool stream.
He had not been in it two minutes before he fell fast
asleep-  into the quietest, cosiest sleep that he had ever
had in his life.
The reason for his falling into such a delightful sleep
was that the fairies took him. And now comes the most
wonderful part of this story. When Tom awoke he found
himself swimming about in the stream. He was about
four inches long.-'.6 259 8e..
3. In fact, the fairies had turned him into a water
baby. He had nothing to do now but enjoy himself and
look at all the pretty things which are to be seen in the
cool, clear water world.
Now, you must know that all the things under the
water talk; only not such a language as ours, but such as
horses and dogs and cows and birds talk to each other.
And Tom soon learned to understand them and to talk
to them, so that he might have had very pleasant company if he had only been a good boy. But, I am sorry to
say, he was too like some other little boys, very fond of
hunting and tormenting creatures for mere'sport.
Some people say that boys cannot help it; that it is
nature. But, whether it is nature or not, little boys can
help it and must help it.
4. But Tom did not know that, and he pecked and
jerked the poor water things about sadly, till they were
all afraid of him and got out of his way or crept into
their shells; so he had no one to speak to or play
with.
The water fairies, of course, were very sorry to see
him so unhappy and longed to tell him how naughty he
was and teach him to be good and to play and romp
with him, too; but they had been forbidden to do that.
Tom had to learn his lesson for himself, as many another
foolish person has to do, though there may be many a-  a 260 8
kind heart yearning over him all the while and longing
to teach him what he can only teach himself.
At last, one day, he found a caddis and wanted it to
peep out of its house; but its house door was shut. He
had never seen a caddis with a house door before, so what
must he do but pull it open to see what the poor lady was
doing inside.
5. So Tom broke to pieces the door, which was the
prettiest little grating of silk, stuck all over with shining
bits of crystal; and when he looked in, the caddis poked
out her head, and it had turned into just the shape of a
bird's.
But when Tom spoke to her she could not answer,
for her mouth and face were tight tied up in a new nightcap of neat pink skin. However, if she did n't answer,
all the other caddises did; for they held up their hands
and shrieked, "Oh, you horrid boy; there you are at it
again!
"And she had just laid herself up for a fortnight's sleep,
and then she would have come out with such beautiful
wings and flown about and laid such lots of eggs; and now
you have broken her door and she can't mend it because
her mouth is tied up for a fortnight, and she will die."
t. So Tom swam away. He was very much ashamed
of himself and felt all the naughtier, as little boys do
when they have done wrong and won't say so.-M. 261 8'.Then he came to a pool full of little trout and began
tormenting them and trying to catch them; but they
slipped through his fingers and jumped out of the water
in their friglht.
But as Tom chased them, he came close to a great
dark hover under an alder-root, and out jumped a huge
old brown trout ten times as big as he was and ran
right against him and knocked all the breath out of his
body; and I don't know which was the more frightened
of the two.
7. Then he went on, sulky and lonely, as he deserved
to be; and under a bank he saw a very ugly creature
sitting, about half as big as himself, which had six legs
and a big stomach and a most ridiculous head with two
great eyes and a face just like a donkey's.
Oh," said Tom, "you are an ugly fellow, to be sure  "
and he began making faces at him, and put his nose close
to him and halloed at him like a very rude boy.
8. When, hey presto! all the thing's donkey face came
off in a moment, and out popped a long arm with a pair
of pincers at the end of it and caught Tom by -the
nose. It did not hurt him much, but it held him quite
tight.
"Yah, ah! Oh, let me go! " cried Tom.
"Then let me go," said the creature. "I want to be
quiet. I want to split."'262 8Tom promised to let him alone and he let go. "Why
do you want to split?" said Tom.
"Because my brothers and sisters have all split and
turned into beautiful creatures with wings; and I want
to split, too. Don't speak to me. I am sure I shall split.
I will split!"
9. Tom stood still and watched him. And he swelled
himself and puffed and stretched himself out stiff, and at
last - crack, puff, bang--he opened all down his back
and then up to the top of his head.
And out of his inside came the most slender, elegant,
soft creature, as soft and smooth as Tom, but very pale
and weak, like a little child who has been ill a long time
in a dark room. It moved its legs very feebly; and then
it began walking slowly up a grass stem to the top of the
water.
Tom was so astonished that he never said a word. And
he went up to the top of the water, too, and peeped out to
see what would happen.
10. And, as the creature sat in the warm, bright sun, a
wonderful change came over it. It grew strong and firm;
the most lovely colors began to show on its body, blue
and yellow and black, spots and bars and rings.
Out of its back rose four great wings of bright brown
gauze; and its eyes grew so large that they filled all its
head and shone like ten thousand diamonds.- 263 e
" Oh, you beautiful creature!  said. Tom; and he put
out his hand to catch it.
But the thing whirred up into the air and hung poised
on its wings a moment and then settled down again by
Tom, quite fearless.
11. "No!" it said, "you cannot catch me. I am a
dragon fly now, the king of all the flies; and I shall
dance in the sunshine and over the river and catch gnats
and have a beautiful wife like myself.! know what I
shall do. Hurrah!"  And he flew away into the air and
began catching gnats.
"Oh! come back, come back," cried Tom, "you beautiful creature! I have no one to play with and I am so
lonely here. If you will but come back I will never try
to catch you."
"I don't care whether you do or not," said the dragon
fly, "for you can't. But when I have had my dinner
and looked a little about this pretty place I will come
back and have a little chat about all I have seen in my
travels."
12. The dragon fly did come back and chatted away
with Tom. He was a little conceited about his fine colors
and his large wings; but you know he had been a poor,
ugly creature all his life before, so there were great
excuses for him.
He was very fond of talking about all the wonderful-T   12  9.twenty, nineteen, and carry one. One from fifteen, fourteen. Fourteen pounds nineteen and- what did I tell
you to remember?"
12. " Ten," said the General.
" Fourteen pounds nineteen shillings and tenpence,
then, is what I want," said Jackanapes.
JACKANAPES AND THE OLD GENERAL.
"All that money! what for?"'To buy Lollo with.  The Gypsy's red-haired pony,
sir.  Oh, he is beautiful! You should see his coat in the
sunshine! You should see his mane!  You should see his
tail!  Such little feet, sir, and they go like lightning!-06 264e9.things he saw in the trees and the meadows, and Tom
liked to listen to him. So in a little while they became
great friends.
And I am very glad to say that Tom learned such a
lesson that day that he did not torment creatures for a
long time after. And then the caddises grew quite tame
and used to tell him strange stories about the way they
built their houses and changed their skins and turned at
last into winged flies; till Tom began to long to change
his skin and have wings like them some day.
13. And the trout and he made it up. So Tom used
to play with them at hare and hounds, and great fun they
had. And he used to try to leap out of the water, head
over heels, as they did before a shower came on; but
somehow he never could manage it.
And very often Tom caught the alder flies and the
caperers and gave them to his friends the trout. Perhaps
he was not quite kind to the flies; but one must do a
good turn to one's friends when one can.
And at last he gave up catching even the flies, for he
made acquaintance with one by accident and found him
a very merry little fellow. This was the way it happened; and it is all quite true.
14. He was basking at the top of the water one hot
day in July, feeding the trout, when he saw a dark gray
little fellow with a brown head. He was a very littlefellow indeed; but he made the most of himself, as people
ought to do.
Instead of getting away, the little fellow hopped upon
Tom's finger and sat there as bold as nine tailors, and he
cried out in the tiniest, shrillest, squeakiest little voice
you ever heard:
" Much obliged to you, indeed; but I don't want it yet."
"Want what?" said Tom, quite taken back by his
impudence.
"Your leg, which you are kind enough to hold out for
me to sit on. I must just go and see after my wife for a
few minutes. When I come back I shall be glad of it,
if you'll be so good as to keep it sticking out just so";
and off he flew.
15. Tom thought him a very cool sort of personage;
and still more so when in five minutes he came back and
said, "Ah, you were tired waiting? Well, your other
leg will do as well."
And he popped himself down on Tom's knee and began
chatting away in his squeaking voice.
"So you live under the water? It's a low place. I
lived there for some time and was very shabby and dirty.
But I did n't choose that that should last. So I turned
respectable and came up to the top and put on this gray suit.
It's a very business-like suit, you think, don't you?"
"Very neat and quiet, indeed," said Tom.
-48 266 6(-'8 266 9e."But I'm tired of it, that's the truth. I've done quite
enough business, I consider, in the last week to last me
my life. So I shall put on a ball dress and go out and be
a smart man and see the gay world and have a dance or
two. Why should n't one be jolly if one can? And here
I go."
16. And as he spoke he turned quite pale and then
quite white.
"Why, you're ill! " said Tom. But he did not answer.
"You're dead," said Tom, looking at him as he stood
on his knee, as white as a ghost.
"No, I'm not! " answered a little squeaking voice over
his head.  "This is me up here in my ball dress, and
that's my skin. Ha, ha! you could not do such a trick
as that! "
And no more Tom could, nor all the conjurers in the
world. For the little rogue had jumped out of his own
skin and left it standing on Tom's knee, eyes, wings,
legs, tail, exactly as if it had been alive.
"Ha, ha!" he said, and he jerked and skipped up and
down, never stopping an instant. "Am I not a pretty
fellow now?"
17. And so he was; for his body was white and his
tail orange and his eyes all the colors of a peacock's tail.
And, what was the oddest of all, the whisks at the end of
his tail had grown five times as long as they were before.-4 267 B'"Ah!" said he, "now I will see the gay world. My
living won't cost me much, for I have no mouth, you see,
and no inside; so I can never be hungry nor have the
stomach-ache neither."
No more he had. He had grown as dry and hard and
empty as a quill, as such silly, shallow-hearted fellows
deserve to grow.
18. But, instead of being ashamed of his emptiness,
he was quite proud of it, as a good many fine gentlemen
are, and began flirting and flipping up and down and
singing:
"My wife shall dance and I shall sing,
So merrily pass the day;
For I hold it one of the wisest things
To drive dull care away."
And he danced up and down for three days and three
nights till he grew so tired that he tumbled into the
water and floated down. But what became of him Tom
never knew and he himself never minded; for Tom
heard him singing to the last as he floated down:
"To drive dull care away-ay-ay!"-- 268 6*THE SUGAR CAMP.

1. I THINK there is no part of farming the boy enjoys
more than the making of maple sugar; it is better than
"blackberrying " and nearly as good as fishing.
In my day maple-sugar-making used to be something
between picnicking and being shipwrecked on a fertile
island, where one saved from the wreck tubs and augers
and great kettles and pork and hens' eggs and rye-andindian bread, and began at once to lead the sweetest life
in the world.
2. I am told that it is the custom now to carefully
collect the sap and bring it to the house, where there are
built brick arches, over which it is evaporated in shallow
pans, and that pains is taken to keep the leaves, sticks,
and ashes and coals out of it, and that the sugar is
clarified.
In short, that it is a money-making business, in
which there is very little fun, and that the boy is not
allowed to dip his paddle into the kettle of boiling sugar
and lick off the delicious syrup.
3. As I remember the New England boy, he used to
be on the alert in the spring for the sap to begin running.
I think he discovered it as soon as anybody. Perhaps he
knew it by a feeling of something starting in his own
veins, - a sort of spring stir in his legs and arms, which-8 270 Sotempted him to stand on his head or throw a handspring,
if he could find a spot of ground from which the snow
had melted.
The sap stirs early in the legs of a country boy and
shows itself in uneasiness in the toes, which get tired of
boots and want to come out and touch the soil just as
soon as the sun has warmed it a little.
4. The country boy goes barefoot just as naturally as
the trees burst their buds which were packed and varnished over in the fall to keep the water and the frost
out.
Perhaps the boy has been out digging into the maple
trees with his jackknife; at any rate, he is pretty sure
to announce the discovery as he comes running into the
house in a great state of excitement with " Sap's runnin'!"
And then, indeed, the stir and excitement begin. The
sap-buckets, which have been stored in the garret over
the woodhouse, are brought down and set out on the
south side of the house and scalded. The snow is still a
foot or two feet deep in the woods, and the ox-sled is got
out to make a road to the sugar camp.
5. It is a great day when the cart is loaded with the
buckets and the procession starts into the woods. The
sun shines into the forest, for there are only naked
branches to bar it, and the snow is soft and beginning to
sink down, leaving the young bushes spindling up everywhere. The snowbirds are twittering about, and the
noise of shouting and of the blows of the axe echoes far
and wide.
In the first place, the men go about and tap the trees,
drive in the spouts, and hang the buckets under.  The
boy wishes that sometime when a hole is bored in a tree
the sap would spout out in a stream as it does when a
cider barrel is tapped; but it never does, it only drops,
sometimes almost in a stream, but on the whole slowly.
6. Then the camp is to be cleared of snow. The
shanty is recovered with boughs. In front of it two great
logs are rolled nearly together, and a fire is built between
them.
Forked sticks are set at each end, and a long pole is
laid on them, and on this are hung the great kettles.
The huge hogsheads are turned right side up and cleaned
out to receive the sap that is gathered.
The great fire that is kindled up is never let out, night
or day, as long as the season lasts. Somebody is always
cutting wood to feed it; somebody is busy most of the
time gathering in the sap; somebody is required to
watch the kettles that they do not boil over and to fill
them.
7. The boy has his own little sap-yoke and small-pails,
with which he gathers the sweet liquid. He has a little
boiling-place of his own with small logs and a tiny kettle.
_1  2 71  ec-'.8 272 9.-'
In the great kettles the boiling goes on slowly, and the
liquid, as it thickens, is dipped from one to another,
until in the end kettle it is reduced to syrup and is taken
out to cool and settle, until enough is made to " sugar off."
To "sugar off" is to boil the syrup until it is thick
enough to crystallize into sugar. This is the grand event
and is only done once in two or three days.
But the boy's desire is to "sugar off" perpetually.
He boils his kettle down as rapidly as possible; he is not
particular about chips, scum, or ashes, and he is apt to
burn his sugar.
8. If he can get enough to make a little wax on the
snow or to scrape from the bottom of the kettle with his
wooden paddle he is happy. A good deal is wasted on
his hands and the outside of his face and on his clothes;
but he does not care..
Sometimes he is left to watch the boiling kettles, with
a piece of pork tied on the end of a stick, which he dips
into the boiling mass when it threatens to go over. He
is constantly tasting of it, however, to see if it is not
almost syrup. He has a long, round stick, whittled
smooth at one end, which he uses for his purpose, at the
constant risk of burning his tongue.
The smoke blows in his face; he is grimy with ashes.
He is altogether such a mass of dirt, stickiness, and sweetness that his own mother would n't know him.-"a 273 e'9. He likes to boil eggs in the hot sap. He likes to
roast potatoes in the ashes, and he would live in the
camp day and night if he were permitted.  Some of
the hired men sleep in the bough shanty and keep the
fire blazing all night.
To sleep there with them and awake in the night and
hear the wind in the trees and see
THE SUGAR CAMP.
the sparks fly up
to the sky is a perfect realization of all the stories of
adventures he has ever read.
He tells the other boys afterwards that he heard something in the night that sounded very much like a bear.
10. The great occasions for the boy, thoulgh, are the
times of "sugaring off."  Sometimes this used to be-48 13 89Such a dear face, too, and eyes like a mouse! But he's
a racer, and the Gypsy wants fifteen pounds for him."
13. "If he's a racer you couldn't ride him. Could
you?"
"No-o, sir, but I can stick to him. I did the other
day."
"Indeed you did! Well, I'm fond of riding myself;
and if the beast is as good as you say, he might suit me."
"You're too tall for Lollo, I think," said Jackanapes,
measuring his grandfather with his eye.
"I can double up my legs, I suppose. We'll have a
look at him to-morrow."
"Don't you weigh a good deal?" asked Jackanapes.
"Chiefly waistcoats," said the General, slapping the
breast of his military frock coat. "We'll have the little
racer on the Green the first thing in the morning. Glad
you mentioned it, grandson; glad you mentioned it."
14. The General.was as good as his word.- Next morning
the Gypsy and Lollo, Miss Jessamine,' Jackanapes and his
grandfather and his dog Spitfire were all gathered at one
end of the Green in a group. The General talked to the
Gypsy, and Jackanapes fondled Lollo's mane, and did not
know whether he should be more glad or miserable if his
grandfather bought him.
"Jackanapes!"
"Yes, sir!"done in the evening, and it was made the excuse for a
frolic in the camp. The neighbors were invited; sometimes even the pretty girls from the village, who filled
all the woods with their sweet voices and merry
laughter.
The white snow still lies on all the ground except the
warm spot about the camp. The tree branches all show
distinctly in the light of the fire, which sends its ruddy
glare far into the darkness and lights up the bough
shanty, the hogsheads, the buckets on the trees, and the
group about the boiling kettles, until the scene is like
something taken out of a fairy play.
11. At these sugar parties every one was expected to
eat as much sugar as possible; and those who are practised in it can eat a great deal.  It is a peculiarity about
eating warm maple sugar that, though you may eat so
much of it one day as to be sick, you will want it the
next day more than ever.
At the " sugaring-off" they used to pour the hot sugar
upon the snow, where it congealed into a sort of wax,,
which I do suppose is the most delicious substance that
was ever invented. And it takes a great while to eat it.
If one should close his teeth firmly on a ball of it he
would be unable to open his mouth until it dissolved.
The sensation while it is melting is very pleasant, but
one cannot converse.-'.  275  8e12. The boy used to make a big lump of it and give it
to the dog, who seized it and closed his jaws on it, as
dogs will on anything. It was funny the next moment
to see the expression of perfect surprise on the dog's face
when he found that he could not open his jaws.
He shook his head; he sat down in despair; he ran
round in a circle; he dashed into the woods and back
again. He did everything except climb a tree and howl.
It would have been such a relief to him if he could have
howled. But that was the one thing he could not do.

Which dwells with all things fair.Spring, with her golden suns and silver rain,
Is with us once again.
In the deep heart of every forest tree
The blood is all aglee,-A  276  9.And there's a look about the leafless bowers
As if they dreamed of flowers.
Yet still on every side we trace the hand
Of winter in the land,
Save where the maple reddens on the lawn,
Flushed by the season's dawn.
But many gleams and shadows need must pass
Along the budding grass,
And weeks go by before the enamored South
Shall kiss the rose's mouth.
Still there's a sense of blossoms yet unborn
In the sweet airs of morn;
One almost looks to see the very street
Grow purple at his feet.
At times a fragrant breeze comes floating by,
And brings, you know not why,
A feeling as when eager crowds await
Before a palace gate,
Some wondrous pageant; and you scarce would start,
If from some beech's heart
A blue-eyed dryad, stepping forth, should say,
"Behold me! I am May!"--g- 277 6SIR WALTER SCOTT.

1. WALTER SCOTT, the great master of fiction, was
born in the beautiful old city of Edinburgh, Scotland, in
the year 1771. His father was a lawyer, and Walter was
his third son. The boy was strong and healthy as a baby,
but when he was about two years old he lost the use of
his right leg as the result of a fever. He was sent to
his grandfather's farm at Sandy-Know.
One of the boy's first memories was of being wrapped
in a sheep's skin and trying to creep after a watch which
was dragged along the floor by his grandfather. When
the day was fine he was usually carried out and laid-"6 278 9.beside the old shepherd among the rocks where he fed
his sheep.
2. The free life in the open air and upon the heathercovered hills gave him strength, and he became a strong,
robust man, although he was somewhat lame all his life.
Scott's father and mother belonged to famous old Scottish
families, and many were the tales of the border life and
its heroes to which the boy listened.
His mother had inspired him with a fondness for poetry,
and he used to read Pope and Homer to her. He was
much interested in the old ballads of border warfare and
legends of his own country, which he soon knew by heart.
3. Little Walter spent the greater part of his time
up to his eighth year at Sandy-Know with his aunt and
grandmother, who were very fond of him. His aunt went
with him one year to Bath, hoping the waters there
would help him, and in his eighth year he was sent
to another famous shore resort.
There he met an old soldier who had been in all the
German wars, and loved to tell the stories of his battles
to the bright-eyed boy. The War of the Revolution was
then going on, and they often talked about that.
It was about that time that General Burgoyne sailed
for America with his men. Walter had just been shown
a picture of the American coast, and the country looked
so rugged and had so many lakes that he said he didn't--n 279 94ABBOTSFORD, SCOTT'S HOME.
believe the General would succeed. This made the old
Captain very indignant, and after Burgoyne's defeat he
would have little to do with the boy.
4. When Walter was nine years old, he returned to
Edinburgh and entered the high school there. He had
had little preparation, and was backward in Latin and
Greek. He did his best to make up for his lameness, and
his playmates thought him a brave, fearless little fellow,
who could tell capital stories.-7 280o 8They spent many a winter's evening around the fireplace, listening to his stories and looking up to him with
as much admiration as if he had been the best football or
cricket player in the school.
This was good training for the future novelist, and the
keen-witted Scotch laddies, with their eager faces glowing
in the ruddy light of the hearth fire, were no mean
critics.
5. At twelve years of age he was sent to the Edinburgh
University, where he spent three years. Scott's father
wished him to become a lawyer like himself, so the future
novelist turned his attention to the studies which would
help in the legal profession. He spent much of his time
in reading stories of adventure, travel, and voyages, and
soon tried to imitate what he so admired.
After leaving college,- he entered his father's office. He
disliked the work there; but his love for his father made
him wish to please him, and he was admitted to the bar
in 1792. He soon became as famous for his story-telling
among the young lawyers as he had been among the
schoolboys.  There were leisure hours, and Scott was
able to read many things outside of his law books.
6. He was greatly interested in old ballads and relics.
Many of the Scotch ballads and old war songs had
never been printed, but were held in the memories of the
old peasants. These old Scottish songs had much strength"a281 8.and expression, and the airs to which they were sung
were full of weird music.
The young lawyer made many journeys among the
Scottish hills, visiting the cabins of the old Highlanders,
whose eyes would flash as they poured forth the songs of
their early days.
One of Scott's friends, Mr. Shortreed, traveled with
him on several of these trips. There was no inn where
they might stop, so the travelers went from the shepherd's
hut to the minister's manse, gathering songs and relics.
7. "It was in this same season, I think," says Mr. Shortreed, "that Sir Walter got from Dr. Elliot the large, old,
border war horn, which you may still see hanging in the
armory at Abbotsford. How great he was when he was
made master of that!  I believe it had been found in
Hermitage Castle, and one of the doctor's servants had
used -it many. a day as a grease horn for his scythe before
they discovered its history. When cleaned out it was
never a hair the worse--the original chain, hoop, and
mouthpiece of steel were all entire.
" Sir Walter carried it home all the way slung about
his neck like Johnny Gilpin's bottle, while I was entrusted
with an ancient bridle bit, which we had likewise picked
up."
8. Scott's fancy for ballads led him to study German,
that he might read this style of poetry in that language,-. 282 9.and his first attempt at writing a poem was the turning
of the German ballad "Leonora" into English verse.
This he did in a single night, at the request of a young
lady. When he read it to her at the breakfast table she
told him that she thought he was going to be a poet.
He was pleased with his own success, and followed this
work with some ballads of his own. In 1802 he sent out
a book called "Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border." In the
meantime he had married Charlotte Carpenter, and had
also been appointed a sheriff, an office with a good salary
and light duties.
9. He was able to continue his writing. His first book
was followed by " Marmion," "The Lady of the Lake,"
and other poems, each adding to his fame. He was a
word painter, and his writing was filled with pictures of
sunset, sea, and forest; but his portraits were still truer
to life, and his historical characters. walk before the eyes
of his readers as in the olden days.
In the summer of 1798 Scott hired a pretty cottage
at Laiswade, about six miles from Edinburgh, and there
he and his wife spent several happy summers. It was a
small house, but there was a garden which was a great
source of pleasure to the poet.
He once said that he never was prouder of his handiwork than after finishing a rustic archway at the entrance
of the Edinburgh road. It was here that he began to-.)B 283 8.--
feel something of his real power and wrote some of those
ballads which made his name great.
10. In 1805 Scott began writing a novel called
"Waverly." He showed the first seven chapters to a
friend, who was not pleased with it; so he laid the
manuscript aside. He afterwards felt sure that a Highland romance would succeed, and thought he would complete it, but was unable to find it.
Some years later, when looking for some fishing tackle
for a friend, he came across it in an old desk; he finished
it, and it was published in 1814 without the name of any
author, as Scott was a little fearful that it might not succeed, and left it to win its own way in the world.
The book soon attracted attention, and Scott was suspected of having written it. "Waverly" was followed
by other novels, and Scott became the popular author of
his day.
11. In 1811 Walter Scott bought a hundred acres of
moorland, bleak and bare, on the river Tweed, near Melrose. The place was filled with historic memories, and
Scott planted it with trees and flowers. He transformed
the house into a castle, with an armory, a library of
poetry and history, and a museum; for the relics of
ancient Scotland were still dear to him.
Walter Scott had four children, two girls and two boys.
They were a constant delight to their father, who tookr"'ju

15. How Jackanapes tumbled on to Lollo's back he
never knew. He had just gathered up the reins when
the Gypsy father took him by the arm.
"If you want to make Lollo go fast, my little gentleman "
"I can make him go! " said Jackanapes; and drawing
from his pocket the trumpet he had bought in the Fair,
he blew a blast both loud and shrill.
Away went Lollo, and away went Jackanapes' hat.
Away went Spitfire, mad with the rapture of the race
and the wind in his silky ears.
Jackanapes and Lollo rode back, Spitfire panting
behind.

Gypsy. "You were born to the saddle. You've the flat

interest in all their joys and sorrows, and they thought
no pleasure complete without his presence.
Washington Irving visited Scott in 1817, and wrote
thus to his brother Peter:
"It is a perfect picture to see Scott and his household
assembled of an evening,- the dogs, stretched before the
fire, the cat perched on a chair, Mrs. Scott and the girls
sewing, and Scott either reading out of some old romance
or telling border stories. Our amusements were occasionally diversified by a border song from Sophia, who is as
well versed in border minstrelsy as her father."-c1 285 9e12. Thus passed the happy days at Abbotsford, as
Scott named his home; and one of Scott's uncles said:
"God bless thee, Walter, my man! Thou hast risen to
be great; but thou wast always good."  In 1821 Scott
was made Sir Walter Scott, Baronet of Abbotsford.
In the year 1826 the firm in which he had become a
partner failed.  Scott gave his fortune toward paying
the creditors, keeping Abbotsford for his family, and then
redoubled his efforts to pay what was still owing. He
wrote twenty novels in the last ten years of his life,
working constantly and refusing to receive aid. He was
offered the position of poet laureate, but declined the
honor, probably because of the task set before him.
13. This strain, together with the death of his beloved
wife, was too great for his health, and brought on paralysis. A royal vessel was provided to take the invalid to
Italy, and he visited Malta, Naples, and Rome. He had
finished his task and paid the debt; but his life work
was over.
He returned to his dear home at Abbotsford, and at
the sight of its familiar scenes he sprang up with a cry of
delight. "I have seen much," he kept saying as they
wheeled him through the rooms, "but nothing like my
ain house; give me one turn more."
14. It was on a beautiful mild day in the September of
1832, and in that dear home, surrounded by those whom-" 286 -
he loved, that Sir Walter Scott breathed his last.. lie
was laid by the side of his wife at DryburghAbbey, in
the border country his pen had made famous; and
travelers from all parts of the world visit his home and
last resting-place.
The city of Edinburgh contains a beautiful monument
to his memory.  There, in the very heart of the city, he
sits upon a marble throne, under a canopy of carven
stone,- a tribute to hills great genius and his pure, noble
character.
WALTER RALEIGH MEETS QUEEN ELIZABETH.

1. THE royal barge, manned with the queen's watermen richly attired in the regal liveries, and having the
banner of England displayed, lay at the great stairs
which ascended from the river.
The yeomen of the guard, the tallest and most handsome men whom England could produce, guarded the
passage from the palace gate to the riverside, and allseemed in readiness for the queen's coming forth, although
the day was yet so early.
Walter Raleigh caused the boat to be pulled toward a
landing-place at some distance from the principal one,
which it would not, at that moment, have been thought
respectful to approach, and jumped on shore, followed,
though with reluctance, by his cautious and timid companions.
As they approached the gate of the palace, one of the
sergeant porters told them they could not at present
enter, as Her Majesty was in the act of coming forth.
2. "Nay, I told you as much before," said Blount;
" do, I pray you, my dear Walter, let us take boat and
return."' Not till I see the queen come forth," returned the
-youth composedly.
"Thou art mad, stark mad! " answered Blount.
"And thou," said Walter, "art turned coward of the
sudden. Thou wouldst blink and go back to shun the
frown of a fair lady!"
At this moment the gates opened, and ushers began
to issue forth in array, preceded and flanked by the band
of Gentlemen Pensioners, After this, amid a crowd of
lords and ladies, yet so disposed- around her that she
could-see and be seen on all sides, came Elizabeth herself,
then in the prime of womanhood and in the full glow of-.* 28 8 84what in a sovereign was called beauty. She leaned on
the arm of Lord Hunsdon.
3. The young cavalier had probably never yet approached so near the person of his sovereign, and he
pressed forward as far as the line of warders permitted,
in order to avail himself of the present opportunity.
His companion, on the contrary, kept pulling him backward, till Walter shook him off impatiently, and let his
rich cloak drop carelessly from one shoulder,- a natural
action which served, however, to display to the best advantage his well-proportioned person.
Unbonneting at the same time, Raleigh fixed his eager
gaze on the queen's approach with a mixture of respectful curiosity and modest yet ardent admiration, which
suited so well his fine features that the warders, struck
with his rich attire and noble countenance, suffered himto approach the ground over which the queen was to
pass somewhat closer than was permitted to ordinary
spectators.
4. Thus the adventurpus youth stood full in Elizabeth's
eye --an eye never indifferent to the admiration which
she deservedly excited among her subjects or to the fair
proportions of external form which chanced to distinguish
any of her courtiers.
Accordingly, she fixed her keen glance on the youth
as she approached the place where he stood, with a look-O 289 9'_{a        s
RALEIGH SPREADS HIS CLOAK FOR THE QUEEN TO WALK UPON.
in which surprise at his boldness seemed to be unmingled
with resentment, while a trifling accident happened which
attracted her attention toward him yet more strongly.
The night had been rainy, and just where the young
gentleman stood, a small quantity of mud interrupted the
queen's passage. As she hesitated to pass on, the gallant,
throwing his cloak from his shoulders, laid it on the
miry spot so as to insure her stepping over it dry-shod.
Elizabeth looked at the young man, who accompanied
this act of devoted courtesy with a profound reverence
and a blush that overspread his whole countenance.5. The queen was confused and blushed in her turn,
nodded her head, hastily passed on, and embarked in her
barge without saying a word.
"Come along, Sir Coxcomb," said Blount; "your gay
cloak will need the brush to-day, I wot."
"This cloak," said the youth, taking it up and
folding it, "shall never be brushed while in my possession."
"And that will not be long if you learn not a little
more economy."
6. Their discourse was here interrupted by one of the
Band of Pensioners.
"I was sent," said he, after looking at them attentively,
"to a gentleman who hath no cloak, or a muddy one.
You, sir, I think," addressing the younger cavalier, "are
the man; you will please to follow me."
"He is in attendance on me," said Blount, "on me,
the noble Earl of Sussex's master of horse."
"I have nothing to say to that," answered the messenger; "my orders are directly from Her Majesty and
concern this gentleman only."
So saying, he walked away, followed by Walter, leaving
the others behind, Blount's eyes almost starting from
his head with the excess of his astonishment. At length
he gave vent to it in an exclamation: "Who would have
thought this?" And, shaking his head with a mysterious-o8 291 86--
air, he walked to his own boat, embarked, and returned
to Deptford.
7. The young cavalier was in the meanwhile guided
to the water side by the Pensioner, who showed him
considerable respect. He ushered him into one of the
wherries which lay ready to attend the queen's barge,
which was already proceeding up the river.
The two rowers used their oars with such expedition at
the signal of the Gentleman Pensioner that they very
soon brought their little skiff under the stern of the
queen's boat, where she sat beneath an awning, attended
by two or three ladies and the nobles of her household.
She looked more than once at the wherry in which the
young adventurer was seated, spoke to those around her,
and seemed to laugh.
8. At length one of the attendants, by the queen's
order apparently, made a sign for the wherry to come
alongside, and the young man was desired to step from
his own skiff into the queen's barge, which he performed
with graceful agility at the fore part of the boat, and
was brought aft to the queen's presence, the wherry at
the same time dropping into the rear.
The youth underwent the gaze of Her Majesty not the
less gracefully that his self-possession was mingled with
embarrassment. The muddied cloak still hung upon his-)8 292 &amp;.arm and formed the natural topic with which the queen
introduced the conversation.
9. "You have this day spoiled a gay mantle in our
service, young man.  We thank you for your service,
though the manner of offering it was unusual and something bold."
"In a sovereign's need," answered the youth, "it is
each liegeman's duty to be bold."
"Indeed, that was well said, my lord," said the queen,
turning to a grave person who sat by her and answered
with a grave inclination of the head.
"Well, young man, your gallantry shall not go unre-,
warded. Go to the wardrobe keeper and he shall have
orders to supply the suit which you have cast away in
our service. Thou shalt have a suit, and that of the
newest cut, I promise thee, on the word of a princess."
10. "May it please your grace," said Walter hesitatingly, "it is not for so humble a servant of Your
Majesty to measure out your bounties; but if it became
me to choose- "
"Thou wouldst have gold, I warrant me," said the
queen, interrupting him; " fie, young man! I take shame
to say that in our capital such and so various are the
means of thriftless folly that to give gold to youth is
giving fuel to fire and furnishing them with the means
of self-destruction. If I live and reign, these means of.- 293 9'.
unchristian excess shall be abridged. Yet thou mayest
be poor," she added, "or thy parents may be; it shall
be gold if thou wilt, but thou shalt answer to me for the
use on't."
11. Walter waited patiently until the queen had done
and then modestly assured her that gold was still less in
his wish than the raiment Her Majesty had before offered.
"How, boy!" said the queen, "neither gold nor garment? What is it thou wouldst have of me, then?"
"Only permission, madam--if it is not asking too
high an honor - to wear the cloak which did you this
trifling service."
"Permission to wear thine own cloak, thou silly boy?"
said the queen.
"It is no longer mine," said Walter; "when Your
Majesty's foot touched it it became a fit mantle for a
prince, but far too rich a one for its former owner."
12. The queen again blushed, and endeavored to cover
by laughing a slight degree of not unpleasing surprise
and confusion.
"Heard you ever the like, my lords?  The youth's
head is turned with reading romances. I must know
something of him that I may send him safe to his friends.
What art thou?"
"Raleigh is my name, most gracious queen, the youngest son of a large but honorable family of Devonshire."-'8 15 8wchairs, the General watching every line of his grandson's
face.
"You must love your aunt very much, Jackanapes."
"I do, sir," said Jackanapes, warmly.
"And whom do you love next best to your aunt?"
17. The ties of blood were pressing very strongly on
the General himself, and perhaps he thought of Lollo.
But love is not bought in a day, even with fourteen
pounds nineteen shillings and tenpence.  Jackanapes
answered quite readily, "The postman."
"Why the postman?"
"He knew my father," said Jackanapes, "and he tells
me about him and about his black mare. My father was
a soldier, a brave soldier. He died at Waterloo. When
I grow up I want to be a soldier too."
"So you shall, my boy; so you shall."
18. "Thank you, grandfather. Aunty doesn't want
me to be a soldier, for fear of being killed."
"Bless my life! Would she have you get into a featherbed and stay there? Why, you might be killed by a
thunderbolt if you were a butter merchant!"
"So I might. I shall tell her so. What a funny fellow
you are, sir! I say, do you think my father knew the
Gypsy's secret? The postman says he used to whisper to
his black mare."
19. "Your father was taught to ride, as a child, by one-06 2949.."Raleigh?" said Elizabeth, after a moment's recollection; " have we not heard of your service in Ireland?"
"I have been so fortunate as to do some service there,
madam," replied Raleigh; "scarce, however, of consequence sufficient to reach Your Grace's ears."
13. " They hear farther than you think of," said the
queen graciously, "and have heard of a youth who
defended a ford in Shannon against a whole band of
rebels until the stream ran purple with their blood and
his own."
"Some blood I may have lost," said the youth, looking
down; " but it was where my best is due, and that is in
Your Majesty's service."
The queen paused and then said hastily: "You are
very young to have fought so well and to speak so well.
So hark ye, Master Raleigh, see thou fail not to wear thy
muddy cloak till our pleasure be further known. And
here," she added, giving him a jewel -of gold in the form
of a chessman, "I give thee this to wear at the collar."
14. Raleigh knelt, and, as he took from her hand the
jewel, kissed the fingers which gave it.
He knew how to mingle the devotion claimed by the
queen with the gallantry due to her personal beauty. In
this, his first attempt to unite them, he succeeded so well
as at once to gratify Elizabeth's personal vanity and her
love of power.'-48295 9.LINCOLN'S GETTYSBURG SPEECH.
1. WHEN Abraham Lincoln had gained the people's
ear, men noticed that he scarcely made a speech or wrote
a state paper in which there was not an illustration or
a quotation from the Bible. He had been thoroughly
instructed in it by his mother.
It was the one book always found in the pioneer's
cabin, and to that, being a woman of deep religious feeling, she turned for sympathy and guidance.  Out of it
she taught her boy to spell and read, and with its poetry,
histories, and principles she so familiarized him that they
always influenced his subsequent life.
2. In the good President's religious faith two leading
ideas were prominent from first to last, - man's helplessness, both as to strength and wisdom, and God's helpfulness in both.
To a friend who anxiously asked him  in the dark
days of 1862, "Do you think we shall succeed?" he
said, "I believe our cause is just; I believe that we
shall conquer in the end. I should be very glad to take
my neck out of the yoke and go back to my old home
and my old life at Springfield.  But it has pleased
Almighty God to place me in this position; and, looking up to Him for support, I must discharge my destiny
as best I can."-4'. 296    C.3. The words of Lincoln seemed to grow more clear and
more remarkable as he approached the end. His last
inaugural was characterized by a solemn, religious tone,
peculiarly free from earthly passion. Listen to his words:
"With malice toward none, with charity for all,
with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the
right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to
bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall
have borne the battle and for his widow and orphans,
to do all'which may achieve and cherish a just and a
lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."
4. Perhaps in no language, ancient or modern, are any
number of words found more touching and eloquent than
his speech of November 19, 1863, at the Gettysburg
dedication.
After Edward Everett had delivered his masterly oration, President Lincoln rose and read the following brief
address:
"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought
forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in
liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal. We are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation- or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated - can long endure.
5. "We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
We are met to dedicate a portion of that field as a final-o8 297  e.resting-place of those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this.
"But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot
consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave
men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated
it far above our power to add or detract. The world
will little note, nor lofg remember, what we say here;
but it can never forget what they did here.
6. "It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated
here to the unfinished work which they have thus far so
nobly carried on. It is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us; that from these
honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall
not have died in vain; that this nation shall, under
God, have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall
not perish from the earth."
7. The audience admired Everett's long oration, but
at Mr. Lincoln's few and simple words they cheered and
sobbed and wept. When the President had ended, he
turned and congratulated the distinguished orator from
the Old Bay State on having succeeded so well.
Mr. Everett replied with a truthful and real compli- a 298 Ement: "Ah, Mr. Lincoln, how gladly would I exchange
all my hundred pages to have been the author of your
twenty lines."
Time has tested the strength of this short, simple
address.  After more than one-third of a century, its
glowing sentences are as familiar to the American people
as household words.
THE LORD OF BUTRAGO.
Translated from the Spanish
BY JOHN C. LOCKHART.
"YOUR horse is faint, my king, my lord! your gallant
horse is sick,His limbs are torn, his breast is gored, on his eye the film
is thick;
Mount, mount on mine, oh, mount apace, I pray thee,
mount and fly!
Or in my arms I'll lift your grace. Their trampling
hoofs are nigh!
" My king, my king! you're wounded sore, - the blood
runs from your feet;
But only lay a hand before, and I'11 lift you to your
seat;-299 9e -
Mount, Juan, for they gather fast i--I hear their coming
cry,
Mount, mount and ride for jeopardy- I'11 save you,
though I die!
"Nay, never speak; my sires, Lord King, received their
land from yours,
And joyfully their blood shall spring, so be it thine secures;
If I should fly, and thou, my king, be found among the
dead,
How could I stand'mong gentlemen, such scorn on my
gray head.
"Castile's proud dames shall never point the finger of
disdain,
And say:'There's one who ran away when our good
lords were slain!'
I leave Diego in your care; you'll fill his father's place;
Strike, strike the spur and never spare! God's blessing
on your grace!"
So spake the brave Montanez, Butrago's lord was he;
And turned him to the coming host in steadfastness and
glee;
He flung himself among them as they came down the hill--
He died, God wot! but not before his sword had drunk
its fill.-'.8 300 8(DEATH OF JACKANAPES.
BY JULIANA H. EWING.
THE following extract is another selection from Mrs. Ewing's
" Jackanapes."

1. THE General's death was a great shock to Miss
Jessamine, and her nephew stayed with her for some
little time after the funeral.  Then he was obliged to
join his regiment which was ordered abroad.
One effect of the conquest which the General had
gained over the affections of the village was a considerable
abatement of the popular prejudice against " the military."
Indeed, the village was now  somewhat importantly
represented in the army. There was the General himself
and the postman and the Black Captain's tablet in the
church and Jackanapes and Tony Johnson and a trumpeter.
2. Tony Johnson had no more natural taste for fighting than for riding, but he was devoted to Jackanapes.
And that was how it came about that Mr. Johnson bought
him a commission in the same cavalry regiment that the-80 Sol 9eGeneral's grandson (whose commission had been given
him by the Iron Duke) was in; and that he was quite
content to be the butt of the mess where Jackanapes was
the hero.
When Jackanapes wrote home to Miss Jessamine, Tony
wrote with the same purpose to his mother, - namely, to
demand her congratulations that they were on active
service at last and were ordered to the front.
And he added a postscript to the effect that she could'
\have no idea how popular Jackanapes was, nor how
splendidly he rode the wonderful red charger which he
had named after his old friend Lollo.
3: When the smoke in front lifted for a moment, the
boy trumpeter could see the plain and the enemy's line
some two hundred yards away. And across the plain
between them he saw Master Jackanapes galloping alone
at the top of Lollo's speed, their faces to the enemy, his
golden head at Lollo's ear.
But at this moment noise and smoke seemed to burst
out on every side; the officer shouted to him to sound
Retire! and between trumpeting and bumping about on
his horse he saw and heard no more of the incidents of
his first battle.
Tony Johnson was always unlucky with horses from
the days of the giddy-go-round onwards. On this day-. 302 9;.
of all days in the year--his own horse was on the sick
list and he had to ride an inferior beast and fell off that
at the very moment when it was a matter of life or death
to be able to ride away. The horse fell on him, but
struggled up again, and Tony managed to keep hold
of it.
4. It was in trying to remount that he discovered, by
helplessness and anguish, that one of his legs was crushed
and broken, and that no feat of which he was master
would get him into the saddle.
Not able even to stand alone, awkwardly, agonizingly,
unable to mount his restive horse, his life was yet SQ
strong within him! On one side of him rolled the dust
and smoke cloud of his advancing foes, and on the other
that which covered his retreating friends.
He turned one piteous gaze after them with a bitter
twinge, not of reproach, but of loneliness; and then,
dragging himself up by the side of his horse, he turned
the other way and drew out his pistol and waited for the
end. Whether he waited seconds or minutes he never
knew before some one gripped him by the arm.
"Jackanapes! God bless you! It's my left leg. If
you could get me on  "
5. It was like Tony's luck that his pistol went off at
his horse's tail and made it plunge; but Jackanapes threw
him across the saddle.-) 303 8iJACKANAPES SAVES TONY.
"Hold on anyhow and stick your spur in. I'll lead
him. Keep your head down; they're firing high."
And Jackanapes laid his head down -to Lollo's ear.
It was when they were fairly off that a sudden
upspringing of the enemy in all directions had made it
necessary to change the gradual retirement of our force
into as rapid a retreat as possible.
And when Jackanapes became aware of this, and felt
the lagging and swerving of Tony's horse, he began to
wish he had thrown hlis friend across his own saddle
and left their lives to Lollo.
When Tony became aware of it several things came
into his head: that the dangers of their ride for life were-.&amp; 1 69'of those horsemen of the East who swoop and dart and

love me a little too. I can tell you more about your
father than the postman can."
"I do love you," said Jackanapes, "and I'11 try to be
very good; but I want to be a soldier."
"You shall, my boy, you shall. Cavalry, I suppose.
Well - well - if you live to be an honor to your country, this old heart shall grow young again with pride for
you; and if you die in the service of your country--it
can but break for you."
HOW THE CLIFF WAS CLAD.

1. BETWEEN two cliffs lay a deep ravine, with a full
stream rolling heavily through it over boulders and rough
ground. It was high and steep, and one side was bare,
save at the foot, where clustered a thick, fresh wood, so
close to the stream. that the mist from the water lay upon
the foliage in spring and autumn. The trees stood looking upwards and forwards, unable to move either way.
2. "What if we were to clothe the Cliff?" said the-'*8 304 8.now more than doubled; that if Jackanapes and Lollo
were not burdened with him they would undoubtedly
escape; that Jackanapes' life was infinitely valuable, and
his--Tony's-was not; and that if he could be courageous and unselfish now6. He caught at his own reins and spoke very loud:
"Jackanapes! It won't do. You and Lollo must go
on. Tell the fellows I gave you back to them with all
my heart. Jackanapes, if you love me, leave me! "
There was a daffodil light over the evening sky in front
of them, and it shone strangely on Jackanapes' hair and
face.  He turned with an odd look in his eyes that a
vainer man than Tony Johnson might have taken for
brotherly pride. Then he shook his head and laughed at
him.
"Leave you? To save my skin? No, Tony, not to save
my soul! "
7. Coming out of a hospital tent, at headquarters, the
surgeon cannoned against and rebounded from another
officer,- a sallow man, not young, with a face worn more
by ungentle experiences than by age, with weary eyes
that kept their own counsel, iron-gray hair, and a mustache that was as if a raven had laid its wing across his
lips and sealed them.
"Well?"- so05  
"Beg pardon, Major. Did n't see you. Oh, compound
fracture and bruises.  But it's all right; he'll pull
through."
"Thank God."
8. It was probably an involuntary expression; for
prayer and praise were not much in the Major's line, as
a jerk of the surgeon's head would have betrayed to an
observer.
He was a bright little man with his feelings showing
all over him, but with gallantry and contempt of death
enough for both sides of his profession, who took a cool
head, a white handkerchief, and a case of instruments
where other men went hot-blooded with weapons, and
who was the biggest gossip of the regiment. - Not even
the Major's taciturnity daunted him.
9. "Did n't think he'd as much pluck about him as
he has. He'll do all right if he does n't fret himself into
a fever about poor Jackanapes."
"Whom are you talking about?" asked the Major,
hoarsely.
"Young Johnson. He--"
"What about Jackanapes?"
" Don't you know?  Sad business.  Rode back for
Johnson and brought him in; but, monstrous ill luck, hit
as they rode. Left lung  "
"Will he recover? "--8 306 9E"No. Sad business. What a frame- what limbs--
what health--and what good looks!  Finest young
fellow- "
"Where is he?"
"In his own tent," said the surgeon, sadly.
The Major wheeled and left him.
10. "Can I do anything else for you?"
"Nothing, thank you.  Except- Major!  I wish 1
could get you to appreciate Johnson."
"This is not an easy moment, Jackanapes."
"Let me tell you, sir - he never will - that if he could
have driven me from him he would be lying yonder at
this moment and I should be safe and sound."
The Major laid his hand over his mouth as if to keep
back a wish he would have been ashamed to utter.
"I've known old Tony from a child. He's a fool on
impulse, a good man and a gentleman in principle. And
he acts on principle.  He's no fire-eater, but he has a
trained conscience and a tender heart, and he'll do his
duty when a braver and more selfish man might fail you.
But he wants encouragement; and when I'm gone -"
11. "'He shall have encouragement. You have my
word for it. Can I do nothing else?"
"Yes, Major. A favor.""Thank you, Jackanapes."
"Be Lollo's master, and love him as well as you can.
He's used to it."
"While I live - which will be longer than I desire or
deserve - Lollo shall want nothing - but - you."
"No, stay -  Major!"
"What? What?"
12. "Say a prayer by me. Out loud, please; I am
getting deaf."
"My dearest Jackanapes - my dear boy - "
"Please," whispered Jackanapes.
Pressed by the conviction that what little he could do
it was his duty to do, the Major, kneeling, bared his head
and spoke loudly, clearly, and very reverently:
" The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ -"
Jackanapes moved his left hand to his right one, which
still held the Major's -
"The love of God  "
And with that - Jackanapes died.-18 308.WASHINGTON'S ADDRESS TO HIS TROOPS.
Before the Battle of Long Island, 1776.
THE Battle of Long Island took place August 27, 1776. It was
lost, and the American Army was obliged to retreat. The defeat
was largely due to the carelessness of General Putnam, who did
not place a guard at all the passes as Washington had ordered him
to do.
Instead of sending word to Washington when he learned that
the British were coming, he sent a few troops to meet their large
army, and they were driven back or made prisoners.
If General Howe of the British Army had been on the alert, he
might have captured General Washington and his whole force; but
Washington watched his opportunity, and retreated in good order.

1. THE time is now near at hand which must probably
determine whether Americans are to be free men or
slaves; whether they are to have any property they can
call their own; whether their houses and farms are to be
pillaged and destroyed and themselves consigned to a
state of wretchedness from which no human efforts will
deliver them.
2. The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under
God, on the courage and conduct of this army. Our cruel
and unrelenting enemy leaves us only the choice of a
brave resistance or the most abject submission.  We
have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or to die.-.8 309 84Our own, our country's honor, calls upon us for a
vigorous and manly exertion; and if we now shamefully
fail we shall become infamous to the whole world.
Let us, then, rely on the goodness of our cause and the
aid of the Supreme Being, in whose hand victory is, to
animate and encourage us to great and noble actions.
3. The eyes of all our countrymen are now upon us,
and we shall have their blessings and praises if, happily,
we are the instruments of saving them from the tyranny
neditated against them.
Let us animate and encourage each other and show the
whole world that a free man contending for liberty on
his own ground is superior to any slavish mercenary on
earth.
4. Liberty, property, life, and honor are all at stake;
upon your courage and' conduct rest the hopes of our
bleeding and insulted country. Our wives, children, and
parents expect safety from us alone, and they have every
reason to believe that Heaven will crown with success so
just a cause.
The enemy will endeavor to intimidate by show and
appearance; but, remember, they have been repulsed on
various occasions by a few brave Americans. Every good
soldier will be silent and attentive- wait for orders and
reserve his fire until he is sure of doing execution.HEIGHO, MY DEARIE.

THE LIGHT-BORN MESSENGER.
BY HALL CAINE.
NAOMI was a beautiful Jewish girl who had been blind all her
life.  Her mother was dead and she and her father had been
treated unkindly by their people.  Learning from the sound of
her father's voice one day that he was suffering and in danger,
her eyes suddenly received their sight.  Israel, her father, was
banished from his home by wicked men; but he found a little
cottage far away from their old home where they might live in
peace.  This extract, taken from "The Scapegoat," tells how she
learned to see.
spon t/nue oUls            im'ple ments
penfe trat ed              hlerlit age
1. AT that moment God wrought a mighty work, a
wondrous change, such as He has brought to pass but
twice or thrice since men were born blind into His world
of light. In an instant, at a thought, by one spontaneous--Q  312  9Gflash, as if the spirit of the girl tore down the dark curtains which had hung seventeen years over the windows
of her eyes, Naomi saw!
She was like a creature born afresh, a radiant and joyful
being, newly awakened into a world of strange sights. But
it was not at once that she fell upon this pleasure.
Throughout the day whereon the last of her great gifts
came to her, when they were cast out of Tetuan, and
while they walked hand in hand through the country
until they lit upon their home, she had kept her eyes
steadfastly closed.
2. The light terrified her. It penetrated her delicate
lids and gave her pain. When for a moment she lifted
her lashes and saw the trees she put out her hand as if to
push them away, and when she saw the sky she raised
her arms as if to hold it off.
Everything seemed to touch her eyes.  The bars of
sunlight seemed to smite them. Not until the falling of
darkness did her fears subside and her spirits revive.
Throughout the day that followed she sat constantly in
the gloom of the blackest corner of their hut.
3. But this was only her baptism of light on coming
out of a world of darkness, just as her fear of the voices
of the earth and air had been her baptism of sound on
coming out of a land of silence. Within three days afterward her terror began to give place to joy, and from-t8 313 8-O
that time forward the world was full of wonder to her
opened eyes.
Then sweet and beautiful beyond all dreams of fancy
were her amazement and delight in every little thing that
lay about her, - the grass, the weeds, the poorest flower
that blew, even the rude implements of the house and the
common stones that worked up through the mould, - all
old and familiar to her fingers, but new and strange to
her eyes, and marvelous as if an angel out of heaven had
dropped them down to her.
4. For many days after the coming of her sight she
continued to recognize everything by touch and sound.
Thus, one morning early in their life in the cottage, and
early also in the day, after Israel had kissed her on the
eyelids to awaken her, she opened her eyes and gazed up
at him as he stooped above her.
She looked puzzled for an instant, being still in the
mists of sleep, and only when she had closed her eyes
again and put out her hand to touch him did her face
brighten with recognition and her lips utter his name.
"My father," she murmured; "my father."
5. Thus again the same day, not an hour afterward,
she came running back to the house from the grass bank
in front of it, holding a flower in her hand and asking a
world of questions concerning it in her broken, lisping,
pretty speech.-.8 17 9..
Juniper one day to the foreign Oak that stood next him.
The Oak looked down to find out who was speaking, and
then looked up again without answering a word. The
Stream worked -so hard that it grew white; the Northwind rushed through the ravine; and the bare Cliff hung
heavily over and felt cold.
"What if we were to clothe the Cliff? " said the Juniper to the Fir on the other side.
3. " Well, if anybody is to do it, I suppose we must,"
replied the Fir, stroking his beard; "what dost thou
think?" he added, looking over to the Birch.
"In God's name, let us clothe it," answered the Birch,
glancing timidly towards the Cliff, which hung over her
so heavily that she felt as if she could scarcely breathe.
And thus, although they were but three, they agreed to
clothe the Cliff. The Juniper went first.
4. When they had gone a little way they met the
Heather. The Juniper seemed, as though he meant to
pass her by. " Nay, let us take the Heather with us,"
said the Fir. So on went the Heather. Soon the Juniper began to slip. " Lay hold on me," said the Heather.
The Juniper did so, and where there was only a little
crevice the Heather put in one finger, and where she had
got in one finger the Juniper put in his whole hand.
They crawled and climbed, the Fir heavily behind with
the Birch. "It is a work of charity," said the Birch.--Q831 148'Why had no one told her that there were flowers that
could see? Here was one which while she looked upon
it had opened its beautiful eye and laughed at her.
"What is it?" she asked;'"what is it?"
"A daisy, my child," Israel answered.
"A daisy!" she cried in bewilderment; and during the
short hush and quick inspiration that followed, she closed
her eyes and passed her nervous fingers rapidly over the
little ring of sprinkled spears and then said very softly,
with head aslant as if ashamed, "Oh, yes, so it is; it is
only a daisy."
6. But to tell of how those first days of sight sped
along for Naomi, with what delight of ever-fresh surprise
and joy of new wonder, would be a long task, if a beautiful one.
They were some miles inside the coast, but from
the little hilltop near at hand they could see it clearly.
One day when Naomi had gone so far with her father
she drew up suddenly at his side and cried in a breathless
voice of awe, "The sky! the sky! Look! It has fallen
onto the land."
"That is the sea, my child," said Israel.
"The sea! " she cried, and then she closed her eyes and
listened, and then opened them and blushed and said,
while her knitted brows smoothed out and her beautiful
face looked aside: " So it is; yes, it is the sea."-.8 315  967. Throughout that day and the night which followed
it, the eyes of her mind were entranced by the marvel of
that vision, and next morning she mounted the hill alone
to look upon it again.
She walked farther and yet farther, wandering on
and on and on as though drawn by the enchantment
of the mighty deep that lay sparkling in the sun,
until at last she came to the head of a deep gully in
the coast.
Still the wonder of the waters held her, but another
marvel now seized upon her sight. The gully was a
lonesome place, inhabited by countless sea birds. From
high up in the rocks above and from far down in the
chasm below, from every cleft on every side they flew
out with white wings and black ones and gray and blue,
and sent their voices into the air until the echoing place
seemed to shriek and yell.
8. It was midday when Naomi reached this spot and
she sat there a long hour. And when she returned to
her father she told him stories of demons that lived in
thousands by the sea and. fought in the air and killed
each other. "And see!" she cried, "look at this, and
this, and this!"
Then Israel glanced at the wrecks she had brought
with her of the warfare that she had witnessed. "And
this," said he, lifting one of them, " is a sea bird's feather,-08 816  134and this," lifting another," is a sea bird's egg, and this,"
lifting the third,'" is a dead sea bird itself."
9. Once more Naomi knit her brows in thought, and
again she closed her eyes and touched the familiar things
wherein her sight had deceived her.." Ah, yes," she said
meekly, looking into her father's eyes with a smile, "they
are only that, after all." And then she said very quietly,
as if speaking to herself, "What a long time it is before
you learn to see! "
One early evening, when she had remained out of the
house until the day was well-nigh done, she came back in
a wild ecstasy to tell of angels that she had just seen in
the sky. They were in robes of crimson and scarlet, their
wings blazed like fire, they swept across the clouds in
multitudes and went down behind the world together,
passing thus out of the earth through the gates of
heaven.
10. Israel listened to her and said, "That was the sunset, my child. Every morning the sun rises and every
night it sets."
Then she looked full into his face and blushed. Her
shame at her sweet errors sometimes conquered her joy
in the new heritage of sight, and Israel heard her whisper
to herself and say, "After all, the eyes are deceitful."
Vision was life's new language, and she had yet to
learn it.-. 817 86But not for long was her delight in the beautiful things
of the world to be damped by any thought of herself.
Nay, the best and rarest part of it, the dearest and most
delicious throb it brought her, came of herself alone.
11. On another early day Israel took her to the coast
and pushed off with her on the waters in a boat. The air
was still, the sea was smooth, the sun was shining, and save
for one white scarf of cloud, the sky was blue.
They were sailing in a tiny bay that was broken by
a little island which lay in the midst like a ruby in a
ring, covered with heather and long stalks of seeding
grass. Through whispering beds of rushes they glided
on and floated over white lilies that swayed between round
leaves of green and gold and purple.
It was a morning of God's own making, and, for joy of
its loveliness no less than of her own bounding life, Naomi
rose in the boat and opened her lips and arms to the
breeze while it played with the rippling currents of her
hair, as if she would drink and embrace it.
12. At that moment a new and dearer wonder came to
her. For, tracing with her eyes the shadow of the cliff
and of the cloud that sailed double in two seas of blue,
she leaned over the side of the boat and then saw the
reflection of another and lovelier vision.
"Father," she cried with alarm, "a face in the water!
Look! Look! Look!",-. 3 18 9.." It is your own, my child," said Israel.
"Mine!" she cried.
"The reflection of your face," said Israel; "the light
and the water make it."
13. The marvel was hard to understand. There was
NAOMI'S FIRST GLIMPSE OF HER OWN FACE.
something ghostly in this thing that was she and yet not
she, this face that looked up at her and laughed and yet
made no voice. She leaned back in the boat and asked
Israel if it was still in the water.
But when at length she had grasped the mystery, the
artlessness of her joy was charming.  She was like a
child in her delight, and like a woman that was still a-..8 319 Gechild in her unconscious love of her own loveliness.
Whenever the boat was at rest she leaned over its bulwark and gazed down into the blue depths.
"How beautiful! " she cried, "how beautiful!"
14. She clapped her hands and looked again, and there
in the still water was the wonder of her dancing eyes.
"Oh! how very beautiful!" she cried without lifting her
face, and when she saw her lips move as she spoke and
her sunny hair fall about her restless head, she laughed
and laughed again with a heart of glee.
Israel looked on for some moments at this sweet
picture.
"Live on like a child always, little one," he thought;
"be a child as long as you can, be a child forever, my
dove, my darling! Never did the world suffer it that I
myself should be a child at all."-4 3820 8THE LITTLE LAND.
BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
WHEN at home alone I sit
And am very tired of it,
I have just to shut my eyes
To go sailing through the skies -
To go sailing far away
To the pleasant land of play;
To the fairyland afar
Where the little people are;
Where the clover tops are trees,
And the rain pools are the seas,
And the leaves, like little ships,
Sail about on tiny trips;
And above the daisy tree,
Through the grasses,
High o'erhead the bumblebee
Hums and passes.
In that forest to and fro
I can wander, I can go;
See the spider and the fly
And the ants go marching by,
Carrying parcels with their feet
Down the green and mossy street.-8 321 9eI can in the sorrel sit
Where the ladybird alit.
I can climb the jointed grass;
And on high
See the greater swallows pass
In the sky,
And the round sun rolling by,
Heeding no such things as I.
Through that forest I can pass
Till, as in a looking-glass,
Humming fly and daisy tree
And my tiny self I see,
Painted very clear and neat
On the rain pool at my feet.
Should a leaflet come to land,
Drifting near to where I stand,
Straight I board that tiny boat
Round the rain pool sea to float.
Little thoughtful creatures sit
On the grassy coasts of it;
Little things with lovely eyes
See me sailing with surprise.
Some are clad in armor green -
These have sure to battle been!-.8 822 9cSome are pied with every hue,
Black and crimson, gold and blue;
Some have wings and swift are gone;
But they all look kindly on.
When my eyes I once again
Open and see all things plain, -
High bare walls, great bare floor,
Great big knobs on drawer and door;
Great big people perched on chairs,
Stitching tucks and mending tears,
Each a hill that I could climb,
And talking nonsense all the time, -
O dear me,
That I could be
A sailor on the rain pool sea,
A climber in the clover tree,
And just come back, a sleepy head,
Late at night to go to bed.-68 323 8(.
ROLF'S LEAP.

1. "WHAT, you're making friends with my old Rolf,
are you, boys? Dear old Rolf! " said Uncle Dick; and at
the sound of his voice away broke Rolf from the two lads,
sending them right and left like a couple of ninepins,
and, bounding forward, lame leg and all, had got his
faithful head in another moment pressed against his
master's side and was lustily wagging his tail.
"That's my good old dog!" said Uncle Dick, and
stroked his favorite's shaggy back and shook the paw
that Rolf kept solemnly presenting for his acceptance at
least a dozen times over.
"He has been going on with such fun, --licking our
faces and putting his paws on our shoulders; and he
rolled Tommy right over on the grass," said Will, the
elder of the two boys.  "Tommy tried to get on his
back and he did n't like it and tumbled him off."
2. "Of course he didn't like it," said Uncle Dick.
"You would n't like to have anybody get on your back if
you were lame in one leg; at least, I know I should n'to-49 is9'.5. But the Cliff began to ponder what little things
these could be that came clambering up it. And when
it had thought over this a few hundred years, it sent
down a little Brook to see about it.  It was just
spring flood, and the Brook rushed on till she met the
Heather.
"Dear, dear Heather, canst thou not let me pass? I
am so little," said the Brook. The Heather, being very
busy, only raised herself a little, and worked on. The
Brook slipped under her, and ran onwards.
"Dear, dear Juniper, canst thou not let me pass? I am
so little," said the Brook.
6. The Juniper glanced sharply at her; but as the
Heather had let her pass, he thought he might do so as
well. The Brook slipped under him, and ran on till she
came where the Fir stood panting on a crag.
"Dear, dear Fir, canst thou not let me pass? I am so
little," the Brook said, fondly kissing the Fir on his foot.
The Fir felt bashful and let her pass. But the Birch
made way before the Brook asked.
" He, he, he," laughed the Brook, as she grew larger.
"Ha, ha, ha," laughed the Brook again, pushing
Heather and Juniper, Fir and Birch, forwards and backwards, up and down on the great crags.
7. It was clear the Cliff did not wish to be clad. The
Heather felt so vexed that she turned green again, and-.' 324 9.I'd tumble him off fast enough. Tommy may do anything else he likes, but he must n't make Rolf carry him."
The two boys and Uncle Dick began to walk round
the garden, and they came to take shelter at last in the
arbor.
"You've got fine red cheeks, boys," said Uncle Dick,
"and two pairs of sturdy legs. Rolf and I would like
to be able to jump about like you, but our jumping days
are over. Not but that Rolf took a finer leap once than
either of you lads have ever done yet," said Uncle Dick,
after a moment or two, and stooped down to pat his
favorite's great head.
"A noble leap, was n't it, my old dog? " he said; and
Rolf looked up with his gentle eyes, being too sleepy to
say much.
The boys had sat down to rest; and so Will said:
"Tell us what sort of a leap Rolf took, Uncle Dick."
3. " We were both of us younger than we are now,"
he said, "when Rolf and I first came together.  Rolf
was a puppy. It was just when I was going out to
Africa that some one gave Rolf to me.'He comes of
a fine stock, and if he proves as good a dog as his father
you won't part with him at the end of a year for a trifle,'
my friend said.
"I soon found that he was right, for, I tell you, boys,
by the year's end I would n't have parted with him, not-.0 325 &amp;if I had parted with my last shilling, and I'd been asked
to sell him for a thousand pounds.
4. " Ah, you're laughing, I see. You think I'm speaking in fun. Not a bit of it! Listen to my story and
when I get to the end of it you shall laugh, if you like.
"I went out, with my regiment to Africa to the Cape
of Good Hope. I stayed there for four years, and they
were as happy years, on the whole, as I ever spent anywhere.  I saw a great number of new things in the
course of them and I made a great number of very kind
friends.
"We weren't very hard worked out there, and many
a pleasant expedition did I have of a few days up country or along the coast, sometimes with a companion,
sometimes alone with only my horse and old Rolf. I
shall never forget some of those little excursions, for it
was in the course of one of them that Rolf took his leap.
5. "I had been riding for five or six miles one pleasant
afternoon. It was just hot enough to make the thought
of a swim delicious; so after I had been riding leisurely
along for some little time I alighted from my horse and,
letting him loose to graze, lay down for a quarter of an
hour to cool myself and then began to make ready for
my plunge.
"I was standing on a little ledge of cliff some six or
seven feet above the sea. It was high tide and the water-48 326.at my feet was about a fathom deep.'I shall have a
delightful swim,' I thought to myself as I threw off my
coat.
" Just at that moment Rolf in a very excited way flung
himself upon me, evidently understanding the meaning
of the proceeding. I repeated the remark aloud.'Yes,
we'll have a delightful swim, you and I together,' I said.'A grand swim, my old lad'; and I clapped his back as
I spoke and encouraged him, as I was in the habit of
doing, to express his feelings without reserve.
6. "But, rather to my surprise, instead of wagging
his tail and wrinkling his nose and performing any of
his usual antics, the creature only lifted up his face and
began to whine.
"He had lain for the quarter of an hour, while I had
been resting, at the edge of the little cliff with his head
dropped over it; but whether he had been taking a sleep
in that position or had been amusing himself by watching
the waves was more than I knew.
"' What's the matter, old fellow?' I said to him
when he set up this dismal howl.' Don't you want to
have a swim? Well, you need n't unless you like, only
I mean to have one; so down with you and let me get
my clothes off.'
7. "But instead of getting down, the creature began to
conduct himself in the strangest way, first seizing me by-e 327 8e'the trousers with his teeth and pulling me to the edge of
the rock as if he wanted me to plunge in dressed as I
was, then catching me again and dragging me back,
much as though I were a big rat that he was trying
to worry.
"This pantomime, I declare, he went through three
separate times, barking and whining all the while, till I
began to think he was going out of his mind.
"At last I got out of patience with the beast. I
could n't conceive what he meant. For two or three
minutes I tried to pacify him, and so long as- I took no
further steps to remove my clothes, he was willing to be
pacified; but the instant I fell to undressing myself
he was on me once more, pulling me this way and that,
hanging on my arms, and howling with his mouth up
in the air.
"At last I lost my temper and I snatched up my gun
and struck him with the butt end of it.
8. " He was quieter after I had struck him," said Uncle
Dick, after a little pause. "For a few moments he lay
quite still at my feet, and I had begun to think that he
was going to give me no more trouble, when, all at once,
just as I had got ready to jump into the water, the
creature sprang to his feet and flung himself upon me
again. He threw himself with all his might upon my
breast and drove me backwards.-0 328 SO"I imagined the poor beast was trying for some reason
of his own to have his own way. I thought it was my
business to teach him that he was not to have his own
way, but that I was to have mine; and so I struck him
three or four times with the end of my gun till at last I
freed myself from him.
9. "He gave a cry when he fell back.  I call it a cry,
for it was more like something human than a dog's howl,
--something so wild and pathetic that, angry as I
was, it startled me. I think if time enough had been
given me I would have made some last attempt then to
understand what the creature meant.
"I was standing a few feet in from the water, and as
soon as I had shaken him off he went to the edge of the
bit of cliff and stood there for a moment till I came up to
him, and then --just as in another second I should have
jumped into the sea -my brave dog, my noble dog, gave
one last whine and one look into my face and took the
leap before me.
" And then, boys, in another instant I saw what he had
meant. He had scarcely touched the water when I saw
a crocodile slip like lightning from a sunny ledge of the
cliff and seize him by the hind legs.
10. "You know that I had my gun close at hand, and
in the whole course of my life I never was so glad to
have my gun beside me.  It was loaded, too, and arevolver. I caught it up and fired into the water. I
fired three times and two of the shots went into the
brute's head.
"One missed him, and the first seemed not to harm
him much, but the third hit him in some vital place, I
hope, - some sensitive place, at any rate, for the hideous
jaws started wide.
"Then I began with all my might to shout out' Rolf!'
I couldn't leave my post, for the brute, though he had
let Rolf go and had dived for a moment, might make
another spring, and I did n't dare to take my eyes off the
spot where he had gone down.
11. "I called to my wounded beast with all my might,
and when he had struggled through the water and gained
a moment's hold of the rock I jumped down and caught
him, and half carried, half dragged him up the little bit
of steep ascent till we were safe on the dry land again.
And then - I - I forgot for a moment or two that I was
a man at all and burst out crying like a child.
"He licked the tears off my cheeks, my poor old fellow,
I remember that. We looked a strange pair, I dare say, as
we lay on the ground together with our heads side by side.
12. "When I had come to my senses a little I had to
try to get my poor Rolf moved.  We were a long way
from any house, and the creature could n't walk a step.
I tore up my shirt and bound his wounds as well as I
-4~ s:0 6 $  could, then I put on my clothes and called to my horse,
and in some way, as gently as I could, I got him and myself together upon the horse's back, and we began our ride.
" There was a village about four or five miles off, and I
made for that. It was a long, hard jolt for a poor fellow
with both his hind legs broken, but he bore it patiently.
I never spoke to him, but, panting as he was, he was ready
to lick my hands and look lovingly up into my face.
13. "I got him to a resting-place at last, after a weary
ride, and then I had his wounds dressed; but it was
weeks before he could stand upon his feet again, and
when at last he began to walk he limped, and he has
gone on limping ever since.'"It's all an old story now, you know," said Uncle
Dick abruptly; "but it's one of those things that a man
does n't forget and that it would be a shame to him if
he ever could forget as long as his life lasts."
14. Uncle Dick stooped down again as he ceased to
speak, and Rolf, disturbed by the silence, raised his head to
look about him. As his master had said, it was a grand
old head still, though the eyes were growing dim now
with age. Uncle Dick laid his hand upon it and the
bushy tail began to wag. It had wagged at the touch of
that hand for many a long day.
"We've been together for fifteen years. He's getting
old now," said Uncle Dick.-'6 831 8THE BUGLE SONG.
BY ALFRED TENNYSON.
THE splendor falls on castle walls
And snowy summits old in story:.The long light shakes across the lakes,
And the wild cataract leaps in glory.
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.
O hark, 0 hear! how thin and clear,
And thinner, clearer, farther going!
O sweet and far from cliff and scar
The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!
Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:
Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.
0 love, they die in yon rich sky,
They faint on hill or field or river:
Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
And grow for ever and for ever.
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.'I 332 8HIS WORD OF HONOR.
THE following graphic story is based upon an incident which
took place during the last struggle of the Commune in 1871, when
the forces of the French government conquered the rabble army
after many riotous contests in tle streets of Paris.

1. HE was only a boy, not yet sixteen, but nevertheless
they were going to shoot him.
The band of insurgents to which he belonged had been'
routed by the' Army of Versailles, and, with some ten of
his comrades, he had been conducted to one&amp; of the city
prisons in Paris.
Struck by his youthful appearance, and also astonished
at the boy's coolness in this hour of extreme peril, the
commandant had ordered that the fatal verdict should,
so far as he was concerned, be suspended for the'moment
and that he should be kept a prisoner until his companions had met their fate at the neighboring barricade.
2. Apparently quite calm and resigned, his great eyes
and his face - the pale face of a Parisian child - showed
neither emotion nor anxiety.  He seemed to watch the
terrible scenes about him  as though they did not concern him.He heard the sinister report of the musketry which
hurled his companions into eternity without moving a
muscle; his calm, fixed gaze seemed to be looking into
the great "Afterwards," which was soon to become the
"Present " to him also.
Perhaps he was thinking of his happy, careless childhood--he had hardly outgrown it; perhaps of his relatives and their sorrow when they should hear of his fate;
of the chain of fatality which had made him fatherless
and had tossed him into the seething turmoil of civil
war, and now demanded his life at the hands of fellow
countrymen; and perhaps he wondered why such things
were.
3. At the time war was declared, he was living happily
with his father and mother, honest working folk who had
apprenticed him to a printer; politics had never troubled
that little household.
It was not long, however, before the Prussians had
slain the head of the family. The privations of the siege,
the long and weary waiting at the butchers' and bakers'
shops when the scanty dole of food was distributed in the
rigor of that terrible winter, had stretched his mother on
the bed of suffering, where she lay slowly dying.
4. One day when he had gone with others to dig for
potatoes in the frost-bound plain of St. Denis, a Prussian
bullet broke his shoulder, and afterwards, driven partly-'A- 1 9   (
then she went on.  "Never mind; take courage!" said
the Heather.
The Juniper sat up to look at the Heather, and at
last he rose to his feet.  He scratched his head, and then
he too went on again, and clutched so firmly, that he

thought the Cliff could not help feeling it.'"If thou wilt
not take me, then I will take thee," said he.
8. The Fir bent his toes a little to feel if they were
whole, lifted one foot, which he found all right, then the
other, which was all right too, and then both feet.  He
first examined the path he had come, then where he had
been lying, and at last where he had to go. Then he
strode onlwards, just as though he had never fallen. The-49 884 9.by hunger, partly by fear of his companions' threats, he
had. enrolled himself in the Army of the Commune. Like
many another, fear and fear only had led him into the
ranks.
He had no heart for a war of brothers, and now that
his life was about to pay the penalty he was glad that
he could lay no man's death to his charge.  He was
innocent of that, at any rate.
5. The things he had seen and suffered during the few
last months had given him a dread of life. He hated to
think of leaving his mother in this terrible world,--his
mother whom he loved so dearly, who had always been
so good to him.
He comforted himself with the thought that before
long she would come, too - she could not have much more
suffering to undergo, she was so weak when he last saw
her, four days ago.,
"Kiss me again, dear--again," she had said, "for I
feel that I may never see you more."
6. "Ah," he thought, sadly, "if they would only trust
me - would give me only one hour of liberty - how I
would run home to her and then come back and give
myself up to the hands that hunger for my life. I would
give my word, and I would keep it. Why not? Save
my mother --and she, too, dying--I have no one to
weep over me if I am shot.-' 335  
"To see her again, to kiss her dear lips once more,
console, encourage her, and leave her hopeful--then I
would face death bravely.'
He was in the midst of these sad reflections when the
commandant, followed by several officers, approached him.
7. " Now, my fine fellow, you and I have a score to
settle; you know what awaits you?"
"Yes; I am ready."
"Really? So ready as all that?  You are not afraid
of death?"
"Less than of life. I have seen so much the last six
months-such awful things--death seems better than
such a life."
"I wager you would not hesitate if I gave you your
choice. If I said:'Put your best foot foremost and show
me how soon you can be out of sight,' you would soon be
off, I'll warrant."
8. "Try me, sir, try me! Put me to the proof; it's
worth a trial. One more or less for your men to shoot,
what does it matter?  One hour of freedom only, not
more; you shall see whether I will keep my word, and
whether I am afraid to die."
"Oh! my boy! you're no fool, but you must take me
for one. Once free and far away, and then to come back
to be shot just as you would keep an ordinary appointment? You will hardly get me to believe that."-48 36 a"Listen, sir, I beg of you. Perhaps you have a good
mother; you love her, your mother, more than aught else
in the whole world. If, like me, you were just going to
die, your last thoughts would be of her. And you would
bless the man who gave you the opportunity of seeing her
once more.
9. "Sir, do for me what you would pray others to do
for you. Give me one hour of liberty and I will give
you my word of honor to return and give myself up. Is
life itself worth a promise broken?"
While he was speaking the commandant was pacing
to and fro, tugging at his mustache and evidently struggling hard to appear unmoved.
"' My word,'" he murmured. "This urchin talks of'my word' as though he were a Knight of the Round
Table!"
10. He stopped abruptly in front of his prisoner and
asked in a severe tone, "Your name?"
"Victor Oury."
" Age?"
"Sixteen on the fifteenth of July next."
"Where does your mother live?"
"At Belleville."
"What made you leave her to follow the Commune?"
"The thirty sous chiefly; one must eat! Then the
neighbors and my comrades threatened to shoot me if I-4P 337 9w.VICTOR BEFORE THE COMMANDANT.
did not march with them. They said I was tall enough
to carry a musket. My mother was afraid of them and
wept and prayed me to obey them."'" You have no father, then?"
" He was killed."
"And where? "
"At Bourget, fighting for his country."
11. The commandant turned towards his staff as- 338 B.though he would consult them at a glance. All seemed
moved to interest and pity.
" Well, then! it is understood," the officer said, gravely,
after a moment's reflection. "You can go and see your
mother. You have given me your word of honor to be
back again in an hour. I shall know then whether you
are a man of character or simply a cowardly boy. I give
you until evening. If you are not here by eight o'clock
I shall say that you are a braggart and care more for life
than honor."
"I thank you, sir. At eight I will be here."
" You are sure?"
" Certain."
" We shall see when the time comes."
12. The boy would have thrown his arms about the
officer in his wild joy and gratitude, but the latter repelled him gently.
"No, not now," he said. " This evening, if you return,
I will embrace you --in front of the firing party," he
added, grimly. " Off with you!"
Victor ran like a hare. The officers smiled as they
watched him disappear. Twenty minutes later he knocked
at his mother's door, and the neighbor who was tending
her opened to him. She started and exclaimed when she
saw him, for she had believed him dead. He would have
rushed to his mother's room, but the woman stopped him.-'.8 339  e.13. " Go very quietly," she said in a low voice; "she is
asleep. She has been very ill since you went away, but
she is a little better now. The doctor said yesterday that
if she could sleep she would soon get stronger; she must
not be awakened. Poor thing! she will be glad to see
you, for she has asked for you so often. When she was
not calling you, she was praying the good Lord to preserve
you and to restore peace in the land."
But Victor thought lie heard his name called in a faint
voice. He moved on tiptoe towards his mother's bed.
He had not been deceived -the sick woman's eyes were
o.pened wide.
"Victor! my boy! " she cried in her thin, weak voice.
Without a word he lay down beside her and her arms
closed round him hungrily.
14. And now the boy who had faced death so impassively could do naught but sob. In his mother's arms,
he became a child once more, timid, despairing.
The sick woman, who seemed to gain strength from
his presence, sought in vain to console him.
"Why do you distress yourself so, my child, my
best beloved?" she asked.  "You shall never leave
me again.
"We will throw that hateful uniform away; I never
want to see it more. I will make haste and get well; I
feel so much stronger since you came. Soon you will go-   340 8&amp;to work again, and you will grow up and become a good
man. The past will only look like a bad dream then, and
we will forget it completely."
15. Poor soul, how should she know that her picture
of a bright future only deepened her boy's anguish? She
was silent, telling herself that the best way to dry tears
is to let them flow freely. She kissed him and let his
weary head fall back on the pillow, and then she gave
herself up to dreams of happier days in store for both of
them.
Victor's sobs grew less frequent and less violent, and
soon nothing could be heard in the little room but the
regular breathing of the mother and her child.
Ashamed of his weakness, the boy forced himself into
self-control, and when he raised his head from the pillow,
once more believing himself stronger than love of life,
his mother, yielding to the reaction which her sudden joy
had caused, was sleeping peacefully.
16. The sight restored his energies. A kind Providence, he thought, had wished to spare him a scene which
his strength and courage could not have borne, and he
resolved to go at once.
Lightly he kissed his mother's forehead, gazing at her
earnestly for a few moments. She seemed to smile, he
thought; then he went out hurriedly and returned to his
post as quickly as he had come.-341 8
"What! so soon?" the commandant cried, astonished.
The good-hearted man had hoped that the boy would not
return.
"But I had promised!"
17. "Doubtless, but why be in such a hurry?  You
might have stayed with your mother some time longer
and still have kept your word."
"Poor mother! After a scene of tears which seemed
to take all my courage - tears of joy for her, of despair
for me- she fell asleep so calmly, so happily, that I dare
not wait for her to wake. She fell asleep with her arms
about me, thinking I should never leave her again; how
could I have told her the truth? Who knows whether I
should have had the courage to leave her after doing so?
And what would you have thought of me if I had not
come back?
18. "So I kissed her and slipped away like a thief
while she was sleeping, and here I am. Pray God may be
good to her as she has been to me. I have one more
thing to ask, - to finish quickly."
The officer looked at the boy with mingled pity and
admiration. His own eyes were full of tears.
"You are quite resigned, then; death does not frighten
you?" he asked.
Victor answered him with a gesture.
"And if I pardoned you? "-4e 342  8j"You would save my mother's life, too, and I would
revere you as a second father."
19. "Well, you are a plucky lad and you have not
deserved to suffer as you have done.  You shall go.
Embrace me first. Now go and go quickly. Join your
mother and love her always."
As he spoke the last few words the officer took the boy
by the shoulders and pushed him gently away.
"It really would have been a pity," he said half apologetically to his staff as he turned towards them.
Victor did not run- he flew home. His mother was
still sleeping. He would dearly have liked to cover her
with kisses, but he did not dare to wake her, although her
sleep seemed troubled. He lay down again beside her.
20. Suddenly She sat up, crying: "Mercy! Victor!
My child! Oh! Mercy! - ah! you are here; it is really
you?" she added, waking.
Her thin, weak hands wandered all over him; she
pressed him close to her and rained kisses on his face.
Then she was shaken by convulsive sobs which Victor
could not calm.
"0 my boy! my boy!" she moaned, "I dreamt they
were going to shoot you! "--%n 343 9(JOHN RIDD'S ADVENTURE.
BY R. D. BLACKMORE.
From "Lorna Doone."
RICHARD D. BLACKMORE was born in Longworth, England, in
1825. He was graduated at Exeter College, Oxford, and became
a lawyer.
Blackmore had no thought of becoming a writer, but, like his
most famous character, John Ridd, he loved out-of-door life.  The
motherhood of nature and the peaceful beauty of the English
scenery appealed to him and he began to write verses.
In 1855 he published a volume of poems, and ten years later his
first novel, c" Clara Vaughn," appeared.
Afowever, it was not until 1869, when Blackmore published
"Lorna Doone," that his writings received attention. This book
grew rapidly into favor, and has been followed by other novels.
Blackmore writes his stories very carefully, describing every
feature of the landscape which he knows so well.
His characters have a quaint simplicity and are brave and
daring.
The story of "Lorna Doone" is filled with truest feeling and
beautiful thought.
It centers about John Ridd, who is Blackmore's finest hero. He
was a boy whose father had been killed by some highwaymen by
the name of Doone. In the following selection the boy tells the
story of one of his adventures.  In after years the young man's
love for Lorna Doone, the queen of a wild band, makes him brave,
and he rescues Lorna by means of his quick wit and courage.

and made terself tidy.
And so they went rapidly on, upwards and sideways,
in sunshine and rain.
"But what in the world is all this?" said the Cliff,
when the summer sun shone, the dewdrops glittered, the
birds sang, the woodmouse squeaked, the hare bounded,
and the weasel hid and screamed among the trees.
9. Then the day came when the Heather could peep
over the Cliff's edge.
" O0 dear me!" said she, and over she went. "What
is it the Heather sees, dear?" said the Juniper, and came
forwards till he, too, could peep over.
"Dear me!" he cried, and over he went. "What's
the matter with the Juniper to-day?" said the Fir, taking
long strides in the hot sun. Soon he, too, by standing on
tiptoe could peep over.
10. "Ah! "   every branch and prickle stood on end
with astonishment.  He strode onwards, and over he
went.
"What is it they all see, and not I?" said the Birch.
"Ah!" said she, putting her head over, "there is a
whole forest, both of Fir and Heather, and Juniper and
Birch, waiting for us on the plain "; and her leaves trembled in the sunshine till the dewdrops fell. "This comes
of reaching forwards," said the Juniper.-8 344 8'.1. BEING resolved to catch some loaches, whatever
trouble it cost me, I set forth, in the forenoon of St.
Valentine's Day, 1675.  When I had traveled two
miles or so, I found a good stream flowing softly into the
body of our brook.
I buckled my breeches far up from the knee, expecting
deeper water, and, crossing the Lynn, went stoutly up
under the branches which hung so dark on the Bagworthy River.
2. Every moment the cold of the water got worse
and worse, until I was fit to cry with it. And so, in a
sorry plight, I came to an opening in the bushes, where
a great, black pool lay in front of me, whitened with
snow, as I thought, at the sides, till I saw it was only
foam froth. Skirting round one side, I came to a sudden
sight and marvel, such as I never dreamed of. For, lo!
I stood at the foot of a long, pale slide of water,
coming without any break for a hundred yards or more,
and fenced on either side with cliff, sheer and straight
and shining. The water neither ran nor fell nor leaped
with any spouting, but made one even slope of it.
3. Then said I to myself: "John Ridd, these trees and
pools and lonesome rocks and setting of the sunlight are
making a grewsome coward of thee. - Shall I go back to
my mother so, and be called her fearless boy?"
But that which saved me from turning back was a&lt; 345 &gt;
strange, inquisitive desire to know what made the water
come down like that and what there was at the top of it.
I crawled along over the fork of rocks where the
water had scooped the stone out, and, shunning thus
the ledge from whence it rose like the mane of a white
horse into the broad, black pool, softly I let my feet
into the dip and rush of the torrent.
4. The green wave came down like great bottles upon
me, and my legs were gone from under me in a moment.
But before I knew aught, except that I must die with
a roar of water upon me, my fork, praise God, stuck fast
in the rock, and I was borne up upon it.
To my great dismay and affright, I saw that no
choice was left me now except that I must climb somehow up that hill of water or else be washed down into
the pool and whirl around it till it drowned me; for
there was no chance of going back by the way I had
gone down into it.
5. Having said the Lord's Prayer, I grasped the good
loach stick and began my course up the fearful torrent
way.
How I went carefully, step by step, never daring to
straighten my knees, is more than I can tell clearly.
The greatest danger of all was just where I saw no
jeopardy, but ran up a patch of black ooze weed in a
very boastful manner, being now not far from the summit.-9 346 9Here I fell and was like to have broken my kneecap,
and the torrent got hold of my other leg while I was
indulging the bruised one.  And then a knotting of
cramp disabled me, and all of my body was sliding. But
my elbow caught in a hole in a rock, and so I managed
to start again.
6. Now, being in the most dreadful fright because I
was so near the top and hope was beating within me,
I labored hard with both legs and arms going like a
mill. At last the rush of forked water drove me into
the middle.
Then I made up my mind to die at last; only it
did seem such a pity after fighting so long to give in.
The light was coming upon me, and again I fought
toward it, when suddenly I felt fresh air and fell forward
into the sunlight.
7. When I came to myself again a little girl was
kneeling at my side, rubbing my forehead tenderly with
a dock leaf and a handkerchief.
"Oh, I am so glad! " she whispered softly, as I opened
my eyes and looked at her; "now you will try to be
better, won't you?"
I had never heard so sweet a sound as came from
between her bright red lips, while there she knelt and
gazed at me; neither had I ever seen anything so
beautiful as the large, dark eyes intent upon me, full of-48 347.JOHN RIDD AND LORNA DOONE.
pity and wonder. Then I wandered with my hazy eyes
down the black shower of her hair; and where it fell
on the turf, among it, like an early star, was the first
primrose of the season.
8. And since that day I think of her through all the
rough storms of my life when I see an early primrose.
" What is your name? " she said, " and how your feet
are bleeding! oh, I must tie them up for you! And no
shoes nor stockings! Is your mother very poor, poor
boy?"
"No," I said, being vexed at this; "we are rich enough
to buy all this great meadow if we chose; and here are
my shoes and stockings."-8 348 8."Why, they are quite as wet as your feet. Please to
let me manage them; I will do it very softly."
"Oh, I don't think much of that," I replied. "But
how you are looking at me! I never saw any one like
you before. My name is John Ridd. What is your
name?"
9. "Lorna Doone," she answered in a low voice, as if
afraid of it, and hanging her head so that I could see
only her forehead and eyelashes; "if you please, my
name is Lorna Doone; and I thought you must have
known it."
Then I stood up and touched her hand and tried to
make her look at me; but she only turned away and
her blushes turned into tears, and her tears to long,
low sobs.
"Don't cry," I said, "whatever you do. I am sure
you have never done any harm. I will give you all my
fish, Lorna, and catch some more for mother; only don't
be angry with me."
10. Here was I, a yeoman's boy, a yeoman every inch
of me; and there was she, a lady born and dressed by
people of rank and taste, who took pride in her beauty.
Though some of her frock was touched with wet, her
dress was pretty enough for the queen of all the angels!
All from her waist to her neck was white, and the dark,
soft weeping of her hair and the shadowy light of her-'8 849 8eeyes, like a wood rayed through with sunset, made it
seem yet whiter.
Seeing how I heeded her, she turned to the stream
in a bashful manner and began to watch the water.
11. I, for my part, being vexed at her behavior to me,
took up all my things and made a fuss about it to let
her know I was going. But she did not call me back
as I had made sure she would do; moreover, I knew
that to try the descent was almost certain death to me,
so at the mouth I came back to her and said:
" Lorna."
"c Oh, I thought you were gone," she answered; " why
did you ever come here? Do you know what the robber
band would do to us if they found you here with me?
They would kill us both outright and bury us here by
the water."
" But why should they kill me?"
12. "Because you have found the way up liere,
and they never could believe it. Now, please to go;
oh, please to go!  They will kill us both in a
moment."
"But I tell you, Lorna, I never saw one like you, and
I must come back again to-morrow, and so must you; and
I will bring you such lots of things --there are apples
and a thrush I caught with only one leg broken andonly put your hand in mine  what little things they-49 o350 8.are, Lorna!-and I will bring you the loveliest dog;
I will show you just how long he is."
"Hush! "
13. A shout came down the valley; and all my heart
was trembling like water after sunset, and Lorna's
face was altered from  pleasant play to terror.  She
looked up at me with such a power of weakness that I
at once made up my mind to save her or die with her.
A tingle went through all my bones, and I only longed
for my carbine. The little girl took courage from me,
and put her cheek quite close to mine.
"Come with me down the waterfall. I can carry you
easily; and mother will take care of you."
"No, no," she cried, as I took her up; " I will tell you
what to do. They are only looking for me.  You see
that hole, that hole there?"
14. She pointed to a little niche in the rock which
verged the meadow about fifty yards away from us. In
the fading of the twilight I could just descry it.
" Yes, I see it; but they will see me crossing the grass
to get there."
"Look! look!"  She could hardly speak. "There is
a way out from the top of it. Oh, here they come; I
can see them."
The little maid turned as white as the snow which
hung on the rocks above her? and then she began to sobaloud, but I drew her behind the withy bushes and close
down to the water. Here they could not see either of
us from the upper valley, and might have sought a long
time for us.
15. Crouching in that hollow nest, I saw a dozen fierce
men come down on the other side of the water, not
bearing any firearms, but looking lax and jovial, as if
they were come from riding.
"Queen! queen!" they were shouting here and there
and now and then. "Where is our little queen gone?"
"They always call me'queen,' and I am to be queen
by and by," Lorna whispered to me, with her little heart
beating against me; " oh, they are crossing by the timber
and there, and then they are sure to see us."
"Stop," said I; "now I see what to do. I must get
into the water, and you must go to sleep."
"To be sure, yes, away in the meadow there. But
how bitter cold it will be for you! "
16. "Now mind you never come again," she whispered
over her shoulder as she crept away. "Only I shall come
sometimes."
I crept into the water and lay down with my head
between two blocks of stone. The dusk was deepening
between the hills, and a white mist lay on the river;
I could see every ripple and twig and glazing of twilight
above it as bright as in a picture; so that to my ignorancethere seemed no chance at all buft what the men must
find me.
For all this time they were shouting and making such
a hullabaloo that the rocks all round the valley rung.
17. I was now desperate, between fear and wretchedness, till I caught a glimpse of the little maid whose
beauty and whose kindliness had made me yearn to be
with her.  And then I knew that for her sake I was
bound to be brave and hide myself. She was lying
beneath a rock, feigning to be fast asleep.
Presently one of the great rough men came round a
corner upon her, and there he stopped and gazed awhile
at her fairness and her innocence. Then he caught her
up in his arms and kissed her.
"Here our queen is! Here's the queen; here's the
captain's daughter!" he shouted to his comrades;'"fast
asleep! Now I have first claim to her, and no one else
shall touch the child. Back, all of you! "
18. He sat her dainty little form upon his great, square
shoulder and her narrow feet in one broad hand; and so in
triumph marched away, with the purple velvet of her skirt
ruffling in his long black beard and the silken length of her
hair fetched out, like a cloud by the wind, behind her.
Going up that darkened glen, little Lorna turned and
put up a hand to me and I put up a hand to her, in
the thick of the mist and the willows.-.8 358 8'She was gone, my little dear, and when I got over
my fright I longed to have more to say to her. Her
voice to me was like a sweet, silver bell intoned to the
small chords of a harp.
I crept into a bush for warmth and rubbed my shivering legs. Then, as daylight sunk below the forget-me-not
of stars, I knew that now must be my time to get away.
19. Through the dusk I had trouble to see the
niche in the cliff at even five land yards of distance;
nevertheless, I entered and held on by some dead fern
stems and did hope that no one would shoot me.
But my joy was like to have ended in sad grief. For,
hearing a noise in front of me, I felt myself going down
some deep passage into a pit of darkness. Then, without
knowing how, I was leaning over a night of water.
20. Suddenly a robin sang in the brown fern and
ivy behind me. I took it for our little Annie's voice
- for she could call any robin --and gathering quick,
warm comfort, sprang up the steep way toward the
starlight. Climbing back, as the stones glided down,
I heard the cold, greedy wave go lapping, like a blind,
black dog, into the distance of arches and hollow depths
of darkness.-48 21 S&lt;NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.

BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.
Do you ask me what I am seeing
While I watch the embers glow,
And list to the wild wind howling
As it drives the winter snow?
I see, away to the eastward,
The line of a storm-beat coast,
And I hear the tread of the hurrying waves,
Like the tramp of a mailed host.
And up and down in the darkness,
And over the frozen sand,
I hear the men of the coast guard
Pacing along the strand,Beaten by storm and tempest
And drenched by the pelting rain,--
From the shores of Carolina
To the wind-swept bays of Maine.
No matter what storms are raging,
No matter how wild the night,
The gleam of their swinging lanterns
Shines out with a friendly light.
--Q  s54 l --.8 355 B9.And many a shipwrecked sailor
Thanks God with his gasping breath
For the sturdy arms of the surfmen
That drew him away from death.
And so, when the wind is wailing
And the air grows dim with sleet,
I think of the fearless watchers
Pacing along their beat.
I think of a wreck, fast breaking
In the surf of a rocky shore,
And the lifeboat leaping onward
To the stroke of the bending oar.
I hear the shouts of the sailors,
The boom of the frozen sail,
And the crack of the icy halyards
Straining against the gale.
"Courage! " the captain trumpets,
" They are sending help from land! "
God bless the men of the coast guard
And hold their lives in His hand!-48 356 SkFOOTBALL AT RUGBY.
BY THOMAS HUGHES.
From "Tom Brown's School Days."
"ToM BROWN'S School Days " and " Tom Brown at Oxford" are
two of the best books ever written for boys and young men.
The author, Thomas Hughes, was born at Newbury, England, in
1823. He spent sevetlal years at Rugby under the mastership of
the famous Dr. Arnold, continuing his education at Oxford.
This selection is from " Tom Brown's School Days," -a graphic
description of life at Rugby, - and. the hero is a manly, sturdy
English boy.
Mr. Hughes was a lawyer as well as a writer and was deeply
interested in aiding the common people.

1. "BUT why do you wear white trousers in November?" said Tom. He had been struck by this peculiarity
in the costume of almost all the schoolhouse boys.
"Why, bless us, don't you know? No, I forgot.
Why, to-day-'s the  schoolhouse  match.   Our  house
plays the whole of the school at football. And we all
wear white trousers to show'em we don't care for
kicks on the shins.  You're in luck to come to-day.
You will see a great match; and Brooke's going to
let me play in quarters.   That's more than he'll do-.*  357  9e.
for any other low-school boy, except James and he's
fourteen."
"Who's Brooke?"
"Why, that big fellow that called over at dinner, to
be sure. He's head of the schoolhouse side, and the
best kick and charger in Rugby."
2. Tom followed East across the level ground till they
came to a sort of gigantic gallows of two poles eighteen
feet high, fixed upright in the ground some fourteen
feet apart, with a crossbar running from one to the
other, at the height of ten feet or thereabouts.
"This is one of the goals," said East, "and you see
the other, across there, right opposite, under the doctor's
wall. Well, the match is for the best of three goals.
Whichever side kicks two goals wins; and it won't do,
you see, just to kick the ball through these posts. It
must go over the crossbar; any height'll do, so long as
it's between the posts.
3. " You'11 have to stay in goal to touch the ball when
it rolls behind the posts, because if the other side touch it
they have a try at goal. Then we fellows in quarters,
we play just about in front of goal here, and have to
turn the ball and kick it back before the big fellows on
the other side can follow it up. And in front of us, all
the big fellows play, and that's where the scrimmages
are mostly."-48 358 8'Next minute East cried out: " Hurrah! here's the
punt-about; come along and try your hand at a kick.".The punt-about is the practice ball, which is just
brought out and kicked about anyhow from one boy to
another before callings-over and dinner and at other odd
times. They joined the boys who had brought it out,
- all small schoolhouse fellows, friends of East.
4. Tom had the pleasure of trying his skill, and
performed very creditably, after first driving his foot
three inches into the ground and then nearly kicking
his leg into the air in vigorous efforts to accomplish a
drop-kick after the manner of East.
The crowd thickened as three o'clock approached;
and when the hour struck, one hundred and fifty boys
were hard at work.
"Hold the punt-about!"  "To the goals!" are the
cries; and the whole mass of boys moves up towards the
two goals, dividing as they go, into three bodies.
That little band on the left, consisting of from fifteen
to twenty boys - Tom amongst them - who are making
for the goal under the schoolhouse wall, are the schoolboys who are not to play-up and have to stay in goal.
The larger body moving to the island goal are the schoolboys in a like predicament.
5. The great mass in the middle are the players-up,
both sides mingled together; they are hanging their-- e0 359 8.jackets and, all who mean real work, their hats, waistcoats, neck-handkerchiefs, and braces on the railings
round the small trees; and there they go by twos and
threes up to their respective grounds.
And now that the two sides have fairly sundered, and
each occupies its own ground and we get a good look
at them, what absurdity is this? You don't mean to say
that those fifty or sixty boys in white trousers, many of
them quite small, are going to play that huge mass opposite?
Indeed I do; they're going to try, at any rate, and
won't make such a bad fight of it, either, mark my word;
for has n't old Brooke won the toss with his lucky halfpenny, and got choice of goals and kick-off?
6. The new ball you may see lie there quite by itself
in the middle, pointing towards the school or island goal;
in another minute it will be well on its way there.
Now look, there is a slight move forward of the
schoolhouse wings, a shout of "Are you ready?" and a
loud affirmative reply.
Old Brooke takes half a dozen quick steps, and away
goes the ball spinning towards the school goal; seventy
yards before it touches ground and at no point above
twelve or fifteen feet high,--a model kick-off, --and
the schoolhouse cheer and rush on. The ball is returned,
and they meet it and drive it back amongst the masses
of the school already in motion.-* 360 847. Then the two sides close, and you can see nothing
for minutes but a swaying crowd of boys, at one point
violently agitated; that is, where the ball is, and there
are the keen players to be met and the glory and the
hard knocks to be got. You hear the dull thud, thud of
the ball and the shouts of 1" Off your side!" "Down with
him!" "Put him over!" "Bravo!"
But see! it has broken; the ball is driven out on
the schoolhouse side, and a rush of the school carries it
past the schoolhouse players-up. " Look out in quarters,"
Brooke's and twenty other voices ring out; no need
to call, though.
8. The schoolhouse captain of quarters has caught it on
the bound, dodges the foremost schoolboys who are heading the rush, and sends it back with a good drop-kick
well into the enemy's country.
And then follows rush upon rush and scrimmage
upon scrimmage, the ball now driven through into the
schoolhouse quarters and now into the school goal;
for the schoolhouse have not lost the advantage which
the kick-off and a slight wind gave them at the outset,
and are slightly "penning" their adversaries.
9. Three-quarters of an hour are gone; first winds
are failing, and weight and numbers beginning to tell.
Yard by yard the schoolhouse boys have been driven
back, contesting every inch of ground.-.*e 381 8The bulldogs are the color of mother earth from
shoulder to- ankle, except young Brooke, who has a
marvelous knack of keeping his legs. The schoolhouse
boys are being "penned" in their turn, and now the
ball is behind their goal under the doctor's wall.
We get a minute's breathing time before old Brooke
kicks out, and he gives the word to play strongly for
touch by the three trees. Away goes the ball and the
bulldogs after it, and in another minute there is a shout
of "In-touch!" "Our ball!"   Now's your time, old
Brooke, while your men are still fresh.
10. He stands with the ball in his hand, while the two
sides form in deep lines opposite one another. He must
strike it straight out between them.  The.lines are
thickest close to him, but young Brooke and two or three
of his men are shifting up further, where the opposite
line is weak.
Old Brooke strikes it out straight and strong and it
falls opposite his brother. Hurrah! that rush has taken
it right through the school line and away past the three
trees far into their quarters, and young Brooke and
the bulldogs are close upon it.
11. The school leaders rush back shouting "C Look out in
goal! " and strain every nerve to catch him, but they are
after the fleetest foot in Rugby. There they go straight
for the school goal posts, quarters scattering before them.-' 3 62 6One after another the bulldogs go down, but young
Brooke holds on. "He is down!"  No! a long stagger,
but the danger is past; that was the shock of Crew, the
most dangerous of dodgers.
And now he is close to the school goal, the ball not
three yards before him. There is a hurried rush of the,                              &lt;4

school fags to the spot, but no one throws himself on the
ball- the only chance -  and young Brooke has touched
it right under the school goal posts.
12. Old Brooke, of course, will kick out the goal, but
who shall catch and place it? Call Crab Jones.
Here he comes sauntering along with a straw in his
mouth, the queerest, coolest fish in Rugby. If he were-0 363 s6tumbled into the moon this minute he would just pick
himself up without taking his hands out of his pockets or
turning a hair.
It is a moment when the boldest charger's heart beats
quick. Old Brooke stands with the ball under his arm
motioning the school back; he will not kick out till they
are all in goal, behind the posts. They are all edging
forward, inch by inch, to get nearer for the rush at Crab
Jones, who stands there in front of old Brooke to catch
the ball.
13. If they can reach and destroy him before he catches,
the danger is over; and with one and the same rush they
will carry it right away to the schoolhouse goal. Fond
hope! it is kicked out and caught beautifully.
Crab strikes his heel into the ground to mark the spot
where the ball was caught, beyond which the school line
may not advance; but there they stand, five deep, ready
to rush the moment the ball touches the ground.
*Take plenty of room! don't give the rush a chance of
reaching you! place it true and steady!  Trust Crab
Jones. He has made a small hole with his heel for the
ball to lie on, by which he is resting on one knee, with
his eye on old Brooke. "Now! "  Crab places the ball
at the word, old Brooke kicks, and it rises slowly and
truly as the school rush forward.
14. Then a moment's pause, while both sides look up-r- 2 2 e.Captain Hawthorne died when Nathaniel was but four
years old, and his Grandfather Manning took the family
to his home. There were uncles and aunts, and they
were very fond of the golden-haired boy and his two
sisters.
2. Nathaniel showed a fondness for reading when very
young, and chose many of the best authors. When he
was six years old his favorite book was Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress"; and whenever he went to visit his
Grandmother Hawthorne, he used to take the large
family copy to an armchair near the window and read it
by the hour. His imagination was active, and he used to
tell long stories of the strange adventures and wonderful
things he was to have when he should be a man.
His uncle, Robert Manning, took charge of the future
author's education, sending him to the best schools, and
afterwards to college. When he was nine years old, he
lamed his foot at a game of ball. It was slow in gaining
strength, and he was obliged to use crutches.
During this time, his teacher, Mr. Joseph Worcester,
the author of the dictionary, used to come to his house
every evening to hear his lessons. He amused himself,
while confined to the house, with publishing a little newspaper, which he printed with his own hand.
3. When Nathaniel was eight or nine years old his
mother took her three children to Raymond, Me., on-7 364 (tat the spinning ball.  There it flies straight between
the two posts, some five feet above the crossbar, an
unquestioned goal; and a shout of real, genuine joy
rings out from the schoolhouse players-up and a faint
echo of it comes over the close from the goal-keepers
under the doctor's wall.
A goal in the first hour- such a thing has n't been
done in the schoolhouse match this five years.
15. " Over! " is the cry; the two sides change goals,
and the schoolhouse goal-keepers come threading their way
across through the masses of the school, the most openly
triumphant of them, amongst whom is Tom, a schoolhouse boy of two hours' standing, getting their ears boxed
in the transit.
Tom is indeed excited beyond measure, and it is all
the sixth-form boy - kindest and safest of goal-keepers
--has been able to do to keep him from rushing out
whenever the ball has been near their goal. So he
holds him by his side and instructs him in the science
of touching.
16. And now the last minutes are come, and the
school gather for their last rush, every boy of the
hundred and twenty who has a run left in him. Reckless
of the defense of their own goal, on they come across the--E  365.level big-side ground --the ball well down amongst
them --straight for our goal, like the column of the
Old Guard up the slope at Waterloo.
All former charges have been child's play to this.
Warner and Hedge have met them, but still on they
come. The bulldogs rush in for the last time; they are
hurled over or carried back, striving hand, foot, and
eyelids.
17. Old Brooke comes sweeping round the skirts of the
play, and, turning short round, picks out the very best
heart of the scrimmage and plunges in. It wavers for
a moment--he has the ball! No, it has passed him,
and his voice rings out clear over the advancing tide:
"Look out in goal!"
Crab Jones catches it for a moment, but before he can
kick, the rush is upon him and passes over him, and he
picks himself up behind them with his straw in his
mouth, a little dirtier, but as cool as ever.
The ball rolls slowly in behind the schoolhouse goal,
not three yards in front of a dozen of the biggest school
players-up.
18. There stands the schoolhouse prepositor, safest
of goal-keepers, and Tom Brown by his side, who has
learned his trade by this time. Now is your time, Toar.
The blood of all the Browns is up, and the two rush in
together and throw themselves on the ball, under the-48 366 8.--
very feet of the advancing column, the prepositor on
his hands and knees arching his back, and Tom all along
on his face.
Over them topple the leaders of the rush, shooting over
the back of the prepositor, but falling flat on Tom and
knocking all the wind out of his small body.
" Our ball," says the prepositor, rising with his prize;
"but get up there; there's a little fellow under you."
They are hauled and roll off him and Tom is discovered,
a motionless body.
19. Old Brooke picks him up.'Stand back! give
him air!" says he, and then, feeling his limbs, adds:
"No bones broken. How do you feel, young'un?"
"Hah-hah," gasps Tom, as his wind comes back;
"pretty well, thank you- all right."
"Who is he?" says Brooke. "Oh, it's Brown; he's
a new boy. I know him," says East, coming up.
"Well, he is a plucky youngster, and will make a
player," says Brooke.
And five o'clock strikes. "No side" is called, and
the first day of the schoolhouse match is over.THE ENCOUNTER WITH  THE PANTHER.
BY JAMES FENIMORE COOPER.
JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, an eminent American novelist, was
born in Burlington, N. J., in September, 1789.
His early life was spent on the shores of Lake Otsego, New
York, where his father lived while the future novelist was very
young. At that time this tract of country was a wilderness, and
the boy became familiar with the hunters and Indians who lived
upon the frontier.
His father, Judge Cooper, was a man of wealth and culture,
and sent his boy to Yale University at the early age of thirteen.
Young Cooper spent three years there and then entered the navy,
remaining in this service until his marriage in 1811, when he
turned his attention to writing.
There were almost no American novels at this time, and the
public were enthusiastic over the author's tales of Indian life and
adventures on the sea.
Cooper's works consist of thirty-two volumes, the most popular
of which are " The Pilot," " The Spy," "The Prairie," and "The
Last of the Mohicans." He died at Cooperstown, in September, 1851.

1. THE day was becoming warm, and the girls plunged
more deeply into the forest. Every tall pine and every
shrub or flower called forth some simple expression of
admiration.In this manner they proceeded along the margin of
the precipice, catching occasional glimpses of the placid
Otsego, when Elizabeth suddenly started and exclaimed:
2. "Listen! there are the cries of a child on this
mountain! Is there a clearing near us, or can some
little one have strayed from its parents?"
" Such things frequently happen," returned Louisa.
"Let us follow the sounds; it may be a wanderer
starving on the hill."
Urged by this consideration, the girls pursued with
quick and impatient steps the low, mournful sounds that
proceeded from the forest. More than once Elizabeth
was on the point of announcing that she saw the sufferer,
when Louisa caught her by the arm, and, pointing behind
them, cried: "Look at the dog! "
3. Brave had been their companion from the time the
voice of his young mistress lured him from his kennel
to the present moment: his advanced age had long before
deprived him of his activity.
Aroused by the cry from Louisa, Miss Temple turned
and saw the dog with his eyes keenly set on some distant
object, his head bent near the ground, and his hair actually
rising on his body through fright or anger.  He was
growling in a low key and occasionally showing his teeth
in a manner that would have terrified his mistress had
she not so well known his good qualities.-- 869 9..4. "Brave!" she said, "be quiet, Brave!  What do
you see, fellow?" At the sounds of her voice, the rage of
the mastiff, instead of being at all diminished, was very
sensibly increased. He stalked in front of the ladies and
seated himself at the feet of his mistress, growling louder
than before, and occasionally giving vent to his ire by a
short, surly barking.
5. " What does he see? " said Elizabeth; " there must
be some animal in sight."
Hearing no answer from her companion, Miss Temple
turned her head and beheld Louisa, standing with her
face whitened to the color of death, and her finger
pointing upward with a sort of flickering, convulsed
motion.
The quick eye of Elizabeth glanced in the direction
indicated by her friend, where she saw the fierce front
and glaring eyes of a panther fixed on them in horrid
malignity and threatening to leap.
"Let us fly!" exclaimed Elizabeth, grasping the arm
of Louisa, whose form yielded like melting snow.
6. There was not a single feeling in the temperament
of Elizabeth Temple that could prompt her to desert a
companion in such an extremity. She fell on her knees
by the side of the inanimate Louisa, tearing from the
person of her friend, with instinctive readiness, such
parts of her dress as might obstruct her respiration,-.8 370 84and encouraging their only safeguard, the dog, at the
same time by the sounds of her voice.
"Courage, Brave!" she cried, her own tones beginning
to tremble, "courage, courage, good Brave! "
7. A quarter-grown cub, that had hitherto been unseen,
now appeared, dropping from the branches of a sapling
that grew under the shade of a beech.  This vicious
creature approached the dog, imitating the actions and
sounds of its parent, but exhibiting a strange mixture
of the playfulness of a kitten with the ferocity of its race.
Standing on its hind legs, it would rend the bark of
a tree with its fore paws and play the antics of a cat;
and then, by lashing itself with its tail, growling and
scratching the earth, it would attempt the manifestations
of anger that rendered its parent so terrific.
8. All this time Brave stood firm and undaunted, his
short tail erect, his body drawn backward on its haunches,
and his eyes following the movements of both the female
panther and the cub. At every gambol played by the
latter it approached nigher to the dog, the growling of
the three becoming more horrid at each moment, until
the younger beast, overleaping its intended bound, fell
directly before the mastiff.
There was a moment of fearful cries and struggles, but
they ended almost as soon as commenced by the cub
appearing in the air, hurled from the jaws of Brave with-.371  8a violence that sent it against a tree so forcibly as to
render it completely senseless.
9. Elizabeth witnessed the short struggle, and her
blood was warming with the triumph of the dog, when
she saw the form of the old panther in the air, springing
twenty feet from the branch of the beech to the back of
the mastiff.
No words of ours can describe the fury of the conflict
that followed. It was a confused struggle on the dry
leaves, accompanied by loud and terrific cries.
Miss Temple continued on her knees, bending over the
form of Louisa, her eyes fixed on the animals with an
interest so intense that she almost forgot her own stake
in the result.  So rapid and vigorous were the bounds
of the panther that her active frame seemed constantly in
the air, while the dog nobly faced his foe at each successive leap.
10. When the panther lighted on the shoulders of
the mastiff, which was her constant aim, old Brave, though
torn with her claws and stained with his own blood that
already flowed from a dozen wounds, would shake off his
furious foe like a feather and, rearing on his hind legs,
rush to the fray again with jaws distended and a dauntless eye.
But age and his pampered life greatly disqualified the
noble mastiff for such a struggle.  In everything butcourage he was only the vestige of what he had once
been.
11. A higher bound than ever raised the wary and
furious beast'far beyond the reach of the dog, who was
making a desperate but fruitless effort to dash at her,
from which she alighted in a favorable position on the
back of her aged foe. For a singJe moment only could
the panther remain there, the great strength of the dog
returning with a convulsive effort.
But Elizabetlh saw, as Brave fastened his teeth in the
side of his enemy, that the collar of brass around his
neck, which had been glittering throughout the fray, was
of the color of blood, and, directly, that his frame was sinking to the earth, where it soon lay prostrate and helpless.
Several mighty efforts of the wildcat to extricate
herself from the jaws of the dog followed, but they
were fruitless until the mastiff turned on his back,
his lips collapsed, and his teeth loosened, when the short
convulsions and stillness that succeeded announced the
death of poor Brave.
12. Elizabeth now lay wholly at the mercy of the
beast. There is said to be something in the front of the
image of the Maker that daunts the hearts of the inferior
beings of His creation; and it would seem that some
such power, in the present instance, suspended the threatened blow.-.8 373  (--
The eyes of the monster and the kneeling maiden
met for an instant, when the former stooped to examine
her fallen foe, next to scent her luckless cub.  From
the latter examination she turned, however, with her
eyes apparently emitting flashes of fire, her tail lashing
her sides furiously, and her claws projecting inches from
her broad feet.
13. Miss Temple did not or could not move. Her
hands were clasped in the attitude of prayer, but her
eyes were still drawn to her terrible enemy; her cheeks
were blanched to the whiteness of marble, and her lips
were slightly separated with horror.
The moment seemed now to have arrived for the
fatal termination, and the beautiful figure of Elizabeth
was bowing meekly to the stroke, when a rustling of
leaves behind seemed rather to mock the organs than
to meet her ears.
"Hist! hist!" said a low voice, "stoop lower, girl;
your bonnet hides the creature's head."
14. It was rather the yielding of nature than a compliance with this unexpected order that caused the head
of our heroine to sink on her bosom, when she heard the
report of the rifle, the whizzing of the bullet, and the enraged cries of the beast which was rolling over on the
earth, biting her own flesh and tearing the twigs and
branches within her reach.  At the next instant, the-.e 23 8.the banks of Sebago Lake. Here the boy lived a free
out-of-door life, and formed his habits of solitude. "I
lived in Maine," he said, "like a bird of the air, so perfect
was the freedom I enjoyed."
He would skate alone in the moonlight upon Sebago
Lake, and often, when tired, would rest in some woodcutter's cabin, warming himself by the huge fireplace.
The deep silence and dark shadows of the pine forests
along the lake shore must have filled his mind with
strange pictures and weird fancies.
In the summer time, he would fish all day or go hunting
armed with an old fowling-piece. Those were delightful
days; but by and by his mother decided that her boy must
learn something more than he got from this wild life, and
Nathaniel was sent back to Salem to prepare for college.
4. In 1821 he entered Bowdoin College. There he led
a happy life, having among his college mates the poet
Longfellow and Franklin Pierce, afterward President of
the United States. It was while in college that he
decided to become an author. He had written verses
some years before, but they had not much merit.
After his graduation he returned to Salem. There he
spent many hours in writing and taking long walks by
himself. His thoughts and fancies were busy as he
roamed about, and much of the beauty of his writings is
due to these solitary rambles.--  374 8fonnrm of the Leather-stocking rushed by her, and he
called aloud:
"Come in, Hector, come in;'t is a hard-lived animal,
and may jump again."
15. The brave hunter fearlessly maintained his position
in front of the girls, notwithstanding the violent bounds
and threatening aspect of the wounded panther, which
gave several indications of returning strength and ferocity,
until his rifle was again loaded, when he stepped up to
the enraged animal, and, placing the muzzle close to her
head, every spark of life was extinguished by the discharge.
The death of her terrible enemy appeared to Elizabeth
like a resurrection from her own grave. Notwithstanding
the fearful aspect of the panther, the eye of the brave
girl had never shrunk from its gaze; and long after the
event, the sweetness of her midnight sleep would be
disturbed, as her active fancy conjured, in dreams, the
most trifling movements of savage fury that the beast
had exhibited in its moment of power.A key to the symbols most of which are used in this Reader tio indicate

V-4924815. A  lady, who was the Annie in "Little Annie's
Ramble," in " Twice Told Tales," remembers Hawthorne
when he returned from Bowdoin College.
She was a little girl and used to sit on his knee,
listening to stories more wonderful and beautiful than
any she had ever read in anry of her fairy books.
In 1837 Hawthorne
published a number of
his stories, under the
title of "Twice Told
Tales."  This book attracted but little attention from  the public,
although his genius was
recognized by some.
__:~.:..:.~          His old classmate,
Mr. Longfellow, was
NORTH BRIDGE, CONCORD BATTLEFIELD, NEAR much impressed by
THE " OLD MANSE."
THE OLD MANSEthem and praised them
highly. Hawthorne, however, was so modest, sensitive,
and retiring that he was unwilling to thrust himself forward, and published nothing more for a number of years.
These two modest little volumes of sketches established
Hawthorne's reputation as one of the most original
authors of our time.
6. In 1842 he was married to Sophia Peabody, and-~3 384 Epop u lar' i ty

they went to Concord, where they lived in the "Old
Manse," a famous homestead near the Concord battlefield.
He and his wife were very happy in this quiet old farmhouse, enjoying together the rural life, and seeing only a
few friends, among them Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Their days glided by as peacefully as the gentle Concord
River, which flowed at the foot of the meadow behind the
"Old Manse."  Hawthorne could see this river from his
study window, and said of it, -
"In the light of a calm and golden sunset it becomes
lovely beyond expression; the more lovely for the
quietude that so well accords with the hour, when even
the wind, after blustering all day long, usually hushes
itself to rest."
7. For four years Hawthorne made this his home.
During this time he wrote the stories called " Mosses
from an Old Manse," and it was here that his daughter
Una was born. Two other children were born later,
Julian, the well-known writer, and Rose. These children
were very dear to their father. He cared for them lovingly, and told them wonderful stories.
The four years in Concord were followed by four years
in Salem, where Hawthorne held a position in the Custom
House. It was not a pleasant place, this dull old Custom
House, but he filled his office most faithfully, using his
spare moments for writing. When he lost the office, in-'*8 26 GE1849, he was discouraged, for he had no heart to try to
sell his books.
8. Mr. James T. Fields, a well-known publisher and
friend of Hawthorne's, went to see him at this time, and
insisted on seeing what he had been writing. Hawthorne
refused at first to spiow it to him, saying, "Who would
THE "OLD MANSE," ONCORD, MASS.
risk pu  shing a book for me, the most unpopular writer
in Am  ica?"  "I would," said Mr. Fields, and Hawthorne  t him take the plan of the story called " The
Scarlet etter."
Mr. Fields read it on his way to Boston, wrote him a
note all aglow with admiration, and returned to Salem
the next day to arrange for its publication. "The Scarlet- 27.Letter" proved to be a book so full of power, feeling,
and poetic spirit that it made the writer famous, and his
fame increased steadily. His people are lifelike; but an
air of mystery broods over them and, holds the reader
spellbound.
9. Hawthorne removed during this year to Lenox, and
lived in a little red cottage among the Berkshire Hills.
There he and his family had a delightful home, enjoying
the constant change-on the lake and mountains, which
could be seen from their windows. Here it was that he
wrote " The House of the Seven Gables."  This story is
full of grace and beauty, and there is a charm about its
quaint characters.
In 1853, President Pierce, Hawthorne's old college
friend, sent him to Liverpool, as American Consul. During his stay there, he received honor and attention from
the best families in England. "Our Old Home" was
written at this time.
10. In 1857, after his term of office as Consul was over,
he went to Italy. He was charmed with the life there,
and said he should carry the old villa with its moss-grown
tower and "' clap it into a romance"; and it was there that
he began " The Marble Faun," which was published both
in England and in America.
Before going to England, Hawthorne had bought a
house in Concord, which he called " The Wayside." He- 289and his family returned there in 1860. In this quiet spot
Hawthorne spent the last four years of his life writing in
the little tower room he had added to his house, that he
might be by himself, and muse and think. At one side
of his house lay a little hillside where he might walk,
and in pleasant weather he could be found there.
Among his writings are a number of stories for children: "The Tanglewood Tales," " The Snow-Image," " The
Wonder Book," and some stories of American history.
11. During the last years, Hawthorne's health began
to fail, and he was unable to apply himself to his writing.
In the month of May, 1864, he went away for a trip with
his old friend President Pierce, and while at Plymouth,
N. H., he fell into a deep sleep never to waken. He was
carried to Concord, and is buried under a group of pines
in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.-od29 8.APRIL.
BY HELEN HUNT JACKSON.
MRS. JACKSON, whose writings under the pseudonym of " H. H."
are favorably known, was the daughter of Professor Fiske of Amherst College. She was born at
Amherst, Mass., in 1831. At an
early age she married an army
officer who met with an accidental
death during the war. Five years
afterward she married Mr. Jackson and made her home in Colo-  
rado.
Mrs. Jackson wrote many vol-  
umes of both prose and verse,
and several stories for children.   
She was deeply interested in the
Indians, and in 1884 published a
powerful novel in their behalf called "Ramona."  Her poems are
marked by spiritual truth and glow with the highest beauty. Mrs.
Jackson died in California in 1885.
ROBINS call robins in tops of trees;
Doves follow doves with scarlet feet;
Frolicking babies, sweeter than these,
Crowd green corners where highways meet.
Violets stir and arbutus wakes,
Claytonia's rosy bells unfold;
Dandelion through the meadow makes
A royal road, with seals of gold.--0 so.Golden and snowy and red the flowers,
Golden and snowy and red in vain;
Robins call robins through sad showers;
The white dove's feet are wet with rain.
For April sobs while these are so glad,
April weeps while these are so gay,--
Weeps like a tired child who had,
Playing with flowers, lost its way.
THE SNOW-IMAGE:
A CHILDISH MIRACLE.

1. ONE afternoon of a cold winter's day, when the sun
shone forth with chilly brightness after a long storm,
two children asked leave of their mother to run out and
play in the new-fallen snow. The elder child was a little
girl, whom, because she was of a tender and modest disposition, and was thought to be very beautiful, herparents, and other people who were familiar with her,
used to call Violet. But her brother was known by the
style and title of Peony, on account of the ruddiness of
his broad and round little phiz, which made everybody
think of sunshine and great scarlet flowers....
" Yes, Violet, - yes, my little Peony," said their kind
mother; "you may go out and play in the new snow."
2. Forth sallied the two children, with a hop-skip-andjump that carried them at once into the very heart of a
huge snowdrift, whence Violet emerged like a snow
bunting, while little Peony floundered out with his round
face in full bloom. Then what a merry time had they!
To look at them, frolicking in the wintry garden, you
would have thought that the dark and pitiless storm had
been sent for no other purpose but to provide a new plaything for Violet and Peony; and that they themselves
had been created, as the snowbirds were, to take delight
only in the tempest, and in the white mantle which it
spread over the earth.
3. At last, when they had frosted one another all over
with handfuls of snow, Violet, after laughing heartily at
little Peony's figure, was struck with a new idea.
"You look exactly like a snow-image, Peony," said
she, "if your cheeks were not so red. And that puts me
in mind! Let us make an image out of snow, -an
image of a little girl,- and it shall be our sister, and-1e 32 8shall run about and play with us all winter long. Won't
it be nice?"
"Oh, yes! " cried Peony, as plainly as he could speak,
for he was but a little boy. " That will be nice! And
mamma shall see it! "
"Yes," answered Violet; "'mamma shall see the new
little girl. But she must not make her come into the
warm parlor; for, you know, our little snow sister will
not love the warmth."
4. And forthwith the children began this great business of making a snow-image that should run about; while
their mother, who was sitting at the window and overheard some of their talk, could not help smiling at the
gravity with which they set about it.  They really
seemed to imagine that there would be no difficulty whatever in creating a live little girl out of the snow....   
Now, for a few moments, there was a busy and earnest but indistinct hum of the two children's voices, as
Violet and Peony wrought together with one happy consent. Violet still seemed to be the guiding spirit, while
Peony acted rather as a laborer, and brought her the
snow from far and near.
5. " Peony, Peony! " cried Violet; for her brother was
at the other side of the garden. "Bring me those light
wreaths of snow that have rested on the. lower branches
of the pear-tree. You can clamber on the snowdrift,-3,- 33 6Peony, and reach them  easily. I must have them  to
make some ringlets for our snow sister's head! "
"Here they are, Violet!"'answered the little boy.
"Take care you do not break them. Well done! Well
done! How pretty!"
"' Does she not look sweetly?" said Violet, with a very
satisfied tone; "' and now we must have some little shin-.
ing bits of ice to make the brightness of her eyes. She
is not finished yet. Mamma will see how very beautiful
she is; but papa will say,'Tush! nonsense! - come in
out of the cold!'"
6. There was a minute or two of silence; for Peony,
whose short legs were never weary, had gone on a pilgrimage again to the other side of the garden. All of a
sudden Violet cried out, loudly and joyfully," Look here, Peony! Come quickly! A light has been
shining on her cheek out of that rose-colored cloud, and
the color does not go away! Is not that beautiful?"
"Yes; it is beau-ti-ful," answered Peony.   O Violet,
only look at her hair! It is all like gold!"
"Oh, certainly," said Violet, as if it were very much a
matter of course. " That color, you know, comes from
the golden clouds that we see up there in the sky. She
is almost finished now. But her lips must be made very
red, - redder than her cheeks. Perhaps, Peony, it will
make thein red if we both kiss them!"7. Accordingly, the mother heard two smart little
smacks, as if both her children were kissing the snowimage on its frozen mouth. But, as this did not seem to
make the lips quite red enough, Violet next proposed that
the snow-child should be invited to kiss Peony's scarlet
cheek.
"Oh, what a cold kiss! " cried Peony.
8. Just then there came a breeze of the pure west wind,
sweeping through the garden and rattling the parlor
windows. It sounded so wintry cold that the mother
was about to tap on the window pane with her thimbled
finger, to summon the two children in, when they both
cried out to her with one voice,"Mamma! mamma! We have finished our little snow
sister, and she is running about the garden with us!"
"Dear mamma! " cried Violet, "pray look out and see
what a sweet playmate we have!"
9. The mother, being thus entreated, could no longer
delay to look forth from the window. And what do you
think *she saw there?  Violet and Peony, of course, her
own two darling children. Ah, but whom or what did
she see besides? Why, if you will believe me, there was
a small figure of a girl, dressed all in white, with rosetinged cheeks and ringlets of golden hue, playing about
the garden with the two children!
The child seemed to be on as familiar terms with Violet- 35 9e-  
and Peony, and they with her, as if all the three had been
playmates during the whole of their little lives. The
mother thought to herself that it must certainly be the
daughter of one of the neighbors, and that, seeing Violet
and Peony in. the garden, the child had run across the
street to play with them. So this kind lady went to the
door, intending to invite the little runaway into her comfortable parlor; for, now that the sunshine was withdrawn, the atmosphere out of doors was already growing
very cold.
10. But, after opening the house door, she stood an
instant on the threshold, wondering how a little girl
could look so much like a flying snowdrift, or how a
snowdrift could look so very like a little girl.
She called Violet, and whispered to her.
"Violet, my darling, what is this child's name? " asked
she. "Does she live near us?"
"Why, dearest mamma," answered Violet, "this is our
little snow sister, whom we have just been making!"
"Yes, dear mamma," cried Peony, running.to his
mother, and looking up simply into her face. "This is
our snow-image! Is it not a nice little child?"-   37  eTHE SNOW-IMAGE.

1. AT this instant a flock of snowbirds came flitting
through the air. As was very natural, they avoided
Violet and Peony. But, - and this looked strange,they. flew  at'; once to the white-robed child, fluttered
eagerly about her head, alighted on her shoulders, and
seerned to claim her as an old acquaintance.
She, on her part, was evidently as glad to see these
little birds, old Winter's grandchildren, as they were to
see her, and welcomed them by holding out both her
hands. Hereupon they each and all tried to alight on
her two palms and ten small fingers and thumbs, crowding one another off, with an immense fluttering of their
tiny wings. One dear little bird nestled tenderly in her
bosom; another put its bill to her lips. They were as
joyous, all the while, and seemed as much in their element
as you may have seen them when sporting with a snowstorm.
2. "Violet," said her mother, greatly perplexed, "tell
me the truth, without any jest. Who is this little girl?"--  38  84
~' My darling mamma," answered Violet, looking seriously into her mother's face, and apparently surprised
that she should need any further explanation, "I have
told you truly who she is. It is our little snow-image,
which Peony and I have been making. Peony will tell
you so, as well as I."
"Yes, mamma," asseverated Peony, with much gravity
in his crimson little phiz; "this is little snow-child.  Is
not she a nice one? But, mamma, her hand is, oh, so
very cold!"
3. While mamma still hesitated what to think and
what to do, the street gate was thrown open, and the
father of Violet and Peony appeared, wrapped in a pilotcloth sack, with a fur cap drawn down over his ears and
the thickest of gloves upon his hands. He soon perceived,
the little white stranger, sporting to and fro in the garden, like a dancing snow-wreath, and the flock of snowbirds fluttering about her head.
"Pray, what little girl may that be?" inquired this
very sensible man. " Surely her mother must be crazy to
let her go out in such bitter weather as it has been to-day,
with only that flimsy white gown and those thin slippers!"
('Dear father," cried Violet, putting herself before
him. "This is our little snow girl, and she cannot live any
longer than while she breathes the cold west wind. Do
not make her come into the hot room! "-4989a O--
4. But now kind Mr. Lindsey had entered the garden,
breaking away from his two children, who still sent their
shrill voices after him, beseeching him to let the snowchild stay and enjoy herself in the cold west wind. As
he approached, the snowbirds took to flight. The little
white damsel also fled backward, shaking her head, as if
to say, " Pray, do not touch me! " and roguishly as it
appeared, leading him through the deepest of the snow.
Once the good man stumbled and floundered down upon
his face, so that, gathering himself up again, with the
snow sticking to his rough pilot-cloth sack, he looked as
white and wintry as a snow-image of the largest size.
5. At length, after a vast deal of trouble, he chased
the little stranger into a corner, where she could not possibly escape him. His wife had been looking on, and, it
being nearly twilight, was wonder-struck to observe how
the snow-child gleamed and sparkled, and how she seemed
to shed a glow all round about her; and when driven into
the corner, she positively glistened like a star!
It was a frosty kind of brightness, too, like that of an
icicle in the moonlight. The wife thought it strange that
good Mr. Lindsey should see nothing remarkable in the
snow-child's appearance.
6. "Come, you odd little thing!" cried the honest
man, seizing her by the hand, " I have caught you at last,
and will make you comfortable in spite of yourself, We-'. 40 9'will put a nice warm pair of worsted stockings on your
frozen little feet, and you shall have a good thick shawl
to wrap yourself in. Your poor white nose, I am afraid,
is actually frost-bitten. But we will make it all right.
Come along in."
7. And so, with a most benevolent smile, this very
well-meaning gentleman took the snow-child by the hand
and led her towards the house. She followed him, droopingly and reluctant, for all the glow and sparkle was
gone out of her figure; and whereas just before she had
resembled a bright, frosty, star-gemmed evening, with a
crimson gleam on the cold horizon, she now looked as
dull and languid as a thaw. As kind Mr. Lindsey led
her up the steps to the door, Violet and Peony looked
into his face, their eyes full of tears, and again entreated
him not to bring their snow-image into the house.
8. "Not bring her in!" exclaimed the kind-hearted
man. "Why, you are crazy, my little Violet! --quite
crazy, my small Peony! She is so cold already that her
hand has almost frozen mine, in spite of my thick gloves.
Would you have her freeze to death?"
His wife, as he came up the steps, had been taking
another long, earnest gaze at the little white stranger.
She hardly knew whether it was a dream or no; but she
could not help fancying that she saw the delicate print of
Violet's fingers on the child's neck. It looked just as if,-C 4 1 ~twhile Violet was shaping out the image, she had given it
a gentle pat with her hand, and had neglected to sinooth
the impression quite away.
"After all, husband," said the mother, -  after all,
she does look strangely like a snow-image! I do believe
she is made of snow! "
9. A puff of the west wind blew against the snow-child,
and again she sparkled like a star.
"Snow!" repeated good Mr. Lindsey, drawing the
reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold. "c No wonder she looks like snow. She is half frozen, poor little
thing! But a good fire will put everything to rights."
The common-sensible man placed the snow-child on
the hearth rug, right in front of the hissing and fuming
stove.
"Now she will be comfortable! " cried Mr. Lindsey,
rubbing his hands and looking about him, with the pleasantest smile you ever saw. " Make yourself at home, my
chliild."
10. Sad, sad, and drooping looked the little white
maiden, as she stood on the hearth rug, with the hot blast
of the stove striking through her. Once she threw a
glance wistfully toward the windows, and caught a
glimpse, through its red curtains, of the snow-covered
roofs and the stars glimmering frostily, and all the delicious intensity of the cold night. The bleak wind rattled-e 42!.the window panes, as if it were summoning her to come
forth. But there stood the snow-child, drooping, before
the hot stove!
But the common-sensible man saw nothing amiss.
11. "Come, wife," said he, "let her have a pair of
thick stockings and a woollen shawl or blanket directly;
and tell Dora to give her some warm supper as soon as
the milk boils. You, Violet and Peony, amuse your little
friend. She is out of spirits, you see, at finding herself
in a strange place. For my part, I will go around among
the neighbors and find out where she belongs."
"Husband! husband! " cried his wife, showing her
horror-stricken face through the window panes. "There
is no need of going for the child's parents! "
"We told you so, father! " screamed Violet and Peony,
as he re-entered the parlor: "You would bring her in;
and now our poor -dear - beau-ti-ful little snow sister is
thawed!"
12. And their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears-; so that their father, seeing what strange
things occasionally happen in this everyday world, felt
not a little anxious lest his children might be going to
thaw too! In the utmost perplexity, he demanded an
explanation of his wife.
She could only reply that, being summoned to the parlor
by the cries of Violet and Peony, she found no trace of-'. 48 8'.
the little white maiden, unless it were the remains of a
heap of snow, which, while she was gazing at it, melted
quite away upon the hearth rug.
13. "And there you see all that is left of it!" added
she, pointing to a pool of water in front of the stove.
"Yes, father," said Violet, looking  reproachfully at
him, through her tears, "there is all that is left of our
dear little snow sister! "
And the Heidenberg stove, through the isinglass of its
door, seemed to glare at good Mr. Lindsey, like a redeyed demon, triumphing in the mischief which it had
done!
A BRAVE BOY.
BY THOMAS NELSON PAGE.
From "Two Little Confederates." Copyright, 1888, by Charles Scribner's Sons.
THOMAS NELSON PAGE, a descendant of General Nelson, one of
the signers of the Declaration of Independence, was born at Oakland, Va., in 1853. The land on which the home of, his boyhood
stood had been granted to General Nelson by King George of
England. The house was situated at the meeting of two roads that
lead to Richmond. During the war these roads were the highways
of two armies.
The boy was taught at home by his aunt and father. He had a
remarkable memory and was very quick at figures.
He and his brothers played about his father's plantation. They
liked to spend their evenings in the log cabins, listening to the--&gt;e 44 e,weird tales told by the colored people, while the burning pine knot
made strange shadows onli the cabin walls.
When the war broke out, the army of North Virginia camped
for two winters near the plantation. The
boys saw a great deal of calmp life, and
listened to war stories without end.
In 1868 the future author went to
)-',g  Washington College, and while there
wrote for the college paper. He after-.... 1:..;       wards taught school, and then studied
law at the University of Virginia, where
he was graduated with honor at the end
of one year.
The many tales heard in his boyhood
and the pictures of plantation life began
to weave themselves into stories.  It
was some time before he was able to find a publisher; but his
talent was finally recognized, and now his tales of the South are
very popular. Whether drawn from  the mansion house or the
cabin, they are filled with humor, pathos, and feeling.
MR. PAGE'S " Two Little Confederates," from which the following selection has been taken, is a story of the war, full of stirring
incidents. Frank and Willie were the " Two Little Confederates."
They had an older brother in the Confederate Army, and he and
Ihis General were hiding in a cave while the Union soldiers were
hlunting for them. The two boys had been to carry some food
to themI.

1. AFTER crossing the gully and walking on through
the woods for what they thought a safe distance, they
turned into the path. They were talking very merrily
about the General and Hugh and their friend Mills, and
were discussing some romantic plan for the recapture of
their horses from the enemy, when they came out of the
path into a road, and found themselves within twenty
yards of a group of Federal soldiers, quietly sitting on
their horses, evidently guarding the road.
2. The sight of the blue coats made the boys jump.
They would have crept back, but it was too late--
they caught the eye of the man nearest them. They
ceased talking as suddenly as birds in the tree stop chirping when the hawk sails over; and when one Yankee
called to them, in a stern tone, "Halt there!" and
started to come toward them, their hearts were in their
mouths.
"Where are you boys going?" he asked, as he came up
to them.'Going home."
"Where do you belong?"
"Over there - at Oakland," pointing in the direction
of their home, which seemed suddenly to have moved a
thousand miles away.
"Where have you been?"  The other soldiers had
come up now.-'8 46 94"Been down this way."  The boys' voices were never
so meek before. Each reply was like an apology.
3. "Been to see your brother?" asked one who had
not spoken before - a pleasant-looking fellow. The boys
looked at him. They were paralyzed by dread of the
approaching question.
"Now, boys, we know where you have been,' said a
small fellow, who wore a yellow chevron on his arm. He
had a thin mustache and a sharp nose, and rode a wiry,
dull, sorrel horse. "You may just as well tell us all about
it. We know you've been to see'em, and we are going
to make you carry us where they are."
"No, we ain't," said Frank, doggedly.
Willy expressed his determination also.
4. "If you don't, it's going to be pretty bad for you,"
said the little corporal. He gave an order to two of the
men, who sprang from their horses, and, catching Frank,
swung him up behind another cavalryman. The boy's
face was very pale, but he bit his lip.
"Go ahead," continued the corporal to a number of
his men, who started down the path. "You four men
remain here till we come back," he said to the men on the
ground, and to two others on horseback. "Keep him
here," jerking his thumb towards Willy, whose face was
already burning with emotion.
5. " I'm going with Frank," said Willy. " Let me go."-_e 47  e(This to the man who had hold of him by the arm.
"Frank, make him let me go," he shouted, bursting into
tears, and turning on his captor with all his little might.
" Willy, he's not goin' to hurt you, - don't you tell! "
called Frank, squirming until he dug his heels so into the
horse's flank that the horse began to kick up.
"Keep quiet, Johnny; he's not goin' to hurt him,"
said one of the men, kindly. He had a brown beard and
shining white teeth.
6. They rode slowly down the narrow  path, the
dragoon holding Frank by the leg. Deep down in the
woods, beyond a small branch, the path forked.
"Which way?" asked the corporal, stopping, and
addressing Frank.
Frank set his mouth tight and looked him in the eyes.
"Which is it?" the corporal repeated.
"I'm not going to tell," said he, firmly.
"Look here, Johnny; we've got you, and we are going
to make you tell us; so you might just as well do it easy.
If you don't, we're goin' to make you."
The boy said nothing.
7. " You men dismount. Stubbs, hold the horses." He
himself dismounted, and three others did the same, giving
their horses to a fourth.
"' Get down!" -this to Frank and the soldier behind
whom he was riding  The soldier dismounted, and the--r 48 &amp;.boy slipped off after him and faced his captor, who held
a strap in one hand.
"Are you goin' to tell us?" he asked.
" No."
"Don't you know?"  He came a step nearer and held
the strap forward.  There was a long silence. The boy's

face paled, but took on a look as if the proceedings were
indifferent to him.
8. "If you say you don't know-" said the man, hesitating in face of the boy's resolution. "Don't you know
where they are?"
" Yes, I know; but I ain't goin' to tell you," said
Frank, bursting into tears.-8 49 94"The little Johnny's game," said the soldier who had
told him the others were not going to hurt Willy. The
corporal said something to this man in an undertone, to
which he replied:
"You can try, but it is n't going to do any good. I
don't half like it, anyway."
Frank had stopped crying after his first outburst.
"If you don't tell, we are going to shoot you," said the
little soldier, drawing his pistol.
9. The boy shut his mouth close and looked straight
at the corporal. The man laid down his pistol, and,
seizing Frank, drew his hands behind him and tied
them.
"Get ready, men," he said, as he drew the boy aside to
a small tree, putting hirim with his back to it.
Frank thought his hour had come. He thought of his
mother and Willy, and wondered if the soldiers would
shoot Willy, too. His face twitched and grew ghastly
white. Then he thought of his father, and of how proud
he would be of his son's bravery when he should hear of
it. This gave hirm strength.
"The knot - hurts my hands," he said.
The man leaned over and eased it a little.
"I was n't crying because I was scared," said Frank.
"Now, boys, get ready," said the corporal, taking up
his pistol.--r050 8610. How large it looked to Frank. He wondered
where the bullets would hit him, and if the wounds
would bleed, and whether he would be left alone all night
out there in the Woods.
"I want to say my prayers," he said, faintly.
The soldier made some reply which he could not hear,
and the man with the beard started forward; but just
then all grew dark before his eyes.
Next, he thought he must have been shot, for he felt wet
about his face, and was lying down. He heard some one
say, " He's coming to "; and another replied, " Thank God! "
11. He opened his eyes. ~ He was lying beside the little
branch with his head in the lap of the big soldier with
the beard, and the little corporal was leaning over him
throwing water in his face from a cap. The others were
standing around.
" What's the matter?" asked Frank.
"That's all right," said the little corporal, kindly.
"We were just a-foolin' a bit with you, Johnny."
"We never meant to hurt you," said the other. " You
feel better now? "
"Yes; where's Willy?"  He was too tired to move.
"He's all right. We'11 take you to him."
"Am I shot?" asked Frank.
"No! Do you think we'd have touched a hair of your
head --and you such a brave little fellow? We were-4951 94.
just trying to scare you a bit and carried it too far, and
you got a little faint, -that's all."
12. The voice was so kind that Frank was encouraged
to sit up.
" Can you walk now? " asked the corporal, helping him
and steadying him as he rose to his feet.
" I'll take him," said the big fellow, and before the boy
could move, he had stooped, taken Frank in his arms, and
was carrying him back toward the place where they had
left Willy, while the others followed after with the horses.
"I can walk," said Frank.
"No, I'll carry you."
13. The boy did not know that the big dragoon was
looking down at the light hair resting on his arm, and
that while he trod the Virginia wood-path, in fancy he
was home in Delaware; or that the pressure the boy felt
from his strong arms was a caress given for the sake of
another boy far away on the Brandywine. A little while
before they came in sight, Frank asked to be put down.
The soldier gently set him on his feet, and before he
let him go, kissed him.
"I've got a curly-headed fellow at home, just the size
of you," he said softly.
Frank saw that his eyes were moist. "I hope you'll
get safe back to him," he said.
"God grant it! " said the soldier.-.*8 52 e.14. When they reached the squad at the gate, they
found Willy still in much distress on Frank's account;
but he wiped his eyes when his brother reappeared, and
listened with pride to the soldiers' praise of Frank's' grit," as they called it. When they let the boys go, the
little corporal wished Frank to accept a five-dollar gold
piece; but he politely declined it.
THE LITTLE POST-BOY.
(Abridged.)
BY BAYARD TAYLOR.
BAYARD TAYLOR, who wrote the story of " The Little Post-Boy,"
was a great traveler and writer.
He was born in 1825 at Kennett
Square, Penn. His earliest desire
was to go forth to see the world.
He writes,  
"In looking back to my childhood, I can recall the intensest'
desire to climb upward and take
n a far wider sweep of vision. I
envied every bird that sat swinging upon the topmost bough of
the great cherry tree; and to rise
in a balloon was a bliss which I
would almost give my life to enjoy.
" Looking out of my window, on a bright  May morning, I discovered a row of slats which had been nailed over the shingles, and-.8 53 s 6had not been removed. Here was a chance to reach the comb of
the steep roof and take my first look abroad into the world. I
ventured out and was soon seated outside the sharp ridge. Unknown forests, new fields, and houses appeared to my triumphant
view. The prospect, though it did not extend more than four
miles in-any direction, was boundless.
"Away in the northeast, glimmering through the trees, was a
white object, probably the front of a distant barn; but I shouted
to the astonished servant girl, who had just discovered me from
the garden below,' I see the falls of Niagara!'"
Bayard had read all the books in the little library of his village
before he was twelve years old, and had several books of his own,
bought with money which he had earned selling nuts. Books of
travel and poetry were his favorites, and he felt sure he should
sometime visit the lands of which he read.
He began writing when very young, but did nothing with his
writings until he was about seventeen, when he went to assist a
printer, who published a village paper. His work there left him
time for reading and writing poems, which were printed in the
newspapers.
His first book was a little volume of poems, published when he
was nineteen. Soon after he went abroad and spent two years
traveling about on foot. On his return, he wrote " Views Afoot,"
which made him well known.
The greater part of his life was spent in traveling and writing.

U'S,'-e 54 e&lt;you many things about their dress, their speech, and their
habits of life, in the different countries I have visited. I
presume, however, that you would rather hear me relate
some of my adventures in which children participated, so
that the story and the information shall be given together.
This one shall be the story of my adventure with a
little post-boy, in the northern part of Sweden. Very
few foreigners travel in Sweden in the winter, on account
of the intense cold.
2. I made my journey in the winter because I was on
my way to Lapland, where it is easier to travel when the
swamps and rivers are frozen, and the reindeer sleds can
fly along over the smooth snow. It was very cold indeed,
the greater part of the time; the days were short and
dark, and if I had not found the people so kind, so cheerful, and so honest, I should have felt inclined to turn
back more than once.
But I do not think there are better people in the world
than those who live in Norrland, which is a Swedish
province, commencing about two hundred miles north of
Stockholm.
They are a tall, strong race, with yellow hair and
bright blue eyes; and the handsomest teeth I ever saw.
They live plainly, but very comfortably, in snug wooden
houses, with double windows and doors to keep out the
cold." 55 9eHere there are neither railroads nor stages, but the
government has established post-stations at distances
varying from ten to twenty miles. At each station a
number of horses are kept, but generally the traveler
has his own sled, and simply hires the horses from one
station to another.
3. I had my own little sled, filled with hay and
covered with reindeer skins to keep me warm. So long
as the weather was not too cold, it was very pleasant to
speed along through the dark forests, over the frozen
rivers, or past farm after farm in the sheltered valleys,
up hill and down, until long after the stars came out, and
then get a warm supper in some dark-red post cottage,
while the cheerful people sang or told stories around the
fire.
At first the thermometer fell to zero; then it went
down ten degrees below; then twenty, and finally thirty.
Being dressed in thick furs from head to foot, I did not
suffer greatly; but I was very glad when the people assured me that such extreme cold never lasted more than
two or three days.
Boys of twelve or fourteen very often went with me to
bring back their fathers' horses, and so long as those
lively, red-cheeked fellows could face the weather, it.
would not do for me to be afraid.
4. One night there was a wonderful aurora in the sky.- 56 -
The streamers of red and blue light darted hither and
thither, chasing each other up to the zenith and down
again to the northern horizon, with a rapidity and a brilliance which I had never seen before. "There will be a
storm soon," said my post-boy; "one always comes after
these lights."
Next morning the sky was overcast, and the short day
was as dark as our twilight. But it was not quite so cold,
and I traveled onward as fast as possible. There was a long
tract of wild and thinly settled country before me, and I
wished to get through it before stopping for the night.
At seven o'clock in the evening I had still one more station of three Swedish miles before reaching the village
where I intended to spend the night. Now, a Swedish
mile is nearly equal to seven English, so that this station
was at least twenty miles long.
5. I decided to take supper while the horse was eating
his feed. They had not expected any more travelers at
the station and were not prepared. The keeper had gone
on with two lumber merchants; but his wife -a friendly,
rosy-faced woman --prepared me some excellent coffee,
potatoes, and stewed reindeer meat, upon which I made
an excellent meal.
I did not feel inclined to go forth into the wintry
storm, but, having set my mind on reaching the village
that night, I was loath to turn back.-.  57 9o"It is a bad night," said the woman, "and my husband
will certainly stay at Umea until morning. Lars will
take you, and they can come back together."
"Who is Lars?" I asked.
" My son," said she. "He is getting the horse ready.
There is nobody else about the house to-night."
6. Just then the door opened, and in came Lars. He
was about twelve years old; but his face was so rosy, his
eyes so clear and round and blue, and his golden hair was
blown back from his face in such silky curls, that he
appeared to be even younger. I was surprised that his
mother should be willing to send him twenty miles
through the dark woods on such a night.
"Come here, Lars," I said. Then I took him by the
hand, and asked,  "Are you not afraid to -go so far tonight?"
He looked at me with wondering eyes and smiled; and
his mother made haste to say: "You need have no fear,
sir. Lars is young; but he'll take you safe enough. If
the storm don't get worse, you'll be at Umea by eleven
o'clock."
7. While I was deliberating with myself the boy had
put on his overcoat of sheepskin, tied the lappets of his
fur cap under his chin, and a thick woolen scarf around
his nose and mouth, so that only the round blue eyes
were visible; and then his mother took down the mittens-'.8 58!tof hare's fur from the stove, where they had been hung
to dry. He put them on, took a short leather whip, and
was ready.
I wrapped myself in my furs, and we went out together.
The driving snow cut me in the face like needles, but
Lars did not mind it in the least. He jumped into the
sled, which he had filled with fresh, soft hay, tucked in
the reindeer skins at the sides, and we cuddled together
on the narrow seat, making everything close and warm
before we set out. I could not see at all.
8. The night was dark, the snow blew incessantly, and
the dark fir-trees roared all around us. Lars, however,
knew the way, and somehow or other we kept the beaten
track. He talked to the horse so constantly and so
cheerfully that after awhile my own spirits began to
rise, and the way seemed neither so long nor so disagreeable.
"Ho there, Axel! " he would say. "Keep the road,not too far to the left. Well done. Here's a level: now
trot a bit."
So we went on, - sometimes up hill, sometimes down
hill, --for a long time, as it seemed. I began to grow
chilly, and even Lars handed me the reins, while he swung
and beat his arms to keep the blood in circulation. He'
no longer sang little songs and fragments of hymns, as
when we first set out; but he was not in the least alarmed-..e 59 ecor even impatient. Whene-ver I asked (as I did about
every five minutes), "Are we nearly there?" he always
answered, "A little farther."
9. Suddenly the wind seemed to increase.
"Ah," said he, "now I know where we are: it's one
mile more." But one mile, you must remember, meant
seven.
Lars checked the horse and peered anxiously from side
to side in the darkness. I looked also, but could see
nothing.
"What is the matter? " I finally asked.
"We have got past the hills on the left," he said.
"The country is open to the wind, and here the snow
drifts worse than anywhere else on the road. If there
have been no ploughs out to-night we'll have trouble."
10. In less than a quarter of an hour we could see that
the horse was sinking in the deep snow. He plunged
bravely forward, but made scarcely any headway, and
presently became so exhausted that he stood quite still.
Lars and I arose from the seat and looked around. For
my part, I saw nothing except some very indistinct shapes
of trees; there was no sign of an opening through them.
In a few minutes the horse started again, and with great
labor carried us a few yards farther.
"Shall we get out and try to find the road? " said I.
"It's no use," Lars answered. "In these new drifts-.66 80 8..
we would sink to the waist. Wait a little and we shall
get through this one."
11. It was as he said. Another pull brought us through
the deep part of the drift, and we reached a place where
the snow was quite shallow. But it was not the hard,
smooth surface of the road: we could feel that the ground
was uneven and covered with roots and bushes.
SEEKING REFUGE FROM THE STORM.
Bidding Axel stand still, Lars jumped out of the sled
and began wading around among the trees. Then I got
o  on the other side, but had not proceeded ten steps
before I began to sink so deeply into the loose snow that
I was glad to extricate myself and return.  It was a
desperate situation, and I wondered how we should ever
get out of it.-&gt; 61 &amp;12. I shouted to Lars, in order to guide him, and it
was not long before he also came back to the sled. "If
I knew where the road is," said he, "I could get into it
again. But I don't know; and I think we must stay
here all night."
"We shall freeze to death in an hour! " I cried. I was
already chilled to the bone. The wind had made me
very drowsy, and I knew that if I slept I should soon be
frozen.
"Oh, no!" exclaimed Lars, cheerfully.'1 am a Norrlander, and Norrlanders never freeze. I went with the
men to the bear hunt last winter up on the mountains,
and we were several nights in the snow. Besides, I know
what my father did with a gentleman from Stockholm on
this very road, and we'll do it to-night."
"What was it?"
"Let me take care of Axel first," said Lars. "We can
spare him some hay and one reindeer skin."
13. It was a slow task to unharness the horse, but we
did it at last. Lars then led him under a fir-tree, and
tied him to a branch, gave him some hay, and fastened
the reindeer skin upon his back.
When this was done, Lars spread the remaining hay
evenly over the bottom of the sled and covered it with
the skins, which he tucked in very firmly on the side-.7  62  &amp;towards the wind. Then, lifting them on the other side,
he said: "Now take off your fur coat, quick, lay it over
the hay and then creep under it."
14. I obeyed as rapidly as possible. For an instant I
shuddered in the icy air; but the next moment I lay
stretched in the bottom of the sled, sheltered from the
storm. I held up the ends of the reindeer skins while
Lars took off his coat and crept in beside me. Then
we drew the skins down and pressed the hay against
them.
When the wind seemed to be entirely excluded, Lars
said we must pull off our boots, untie our scarfs, and so
loosen our clothes that they would not feel tight upon
any part of the body. When this was done, and we lay
close together, warming each other, I found that the chill
gradually passed out of my blood.
15. A delightful feeling of comfort crept over me, and
I lay as snugly as in the best bed. I was surprised to find
that, although my head was covered, I did not feel stifled.
Enough air came in under the skins to prevent us from
feeling oppressed.
There was barely room for the two of us to lie, with no
chance of turning over or rolling about. In five minutes,
I think, we were asleep, and I dreamed of gathering
peaches on a warm August day at home. In fact, I did
not wake up thoroughly during the night; neither did-.0 63 9eLars, though it seemed to me that we both talked in our
sleep.
Just as I was beginning to feel a little cramped and
stiff from lying so still, I was suddenly aroused by the
cold wind on my face. Lars had risen upon his elbow
and was peeping out from under the skins.
16. "I think it must be near six o'clock," he said.
"The sky is clear, and I can see the big star. We can
start in another hour."
I felt so much refreshed that I was for setting out immediately; but Lars remarked, very sensibly, that it was
not yet possible to find the road. While we were talking,
Axel neighed.
"There they are! " cried Lars, and immediately began
to put on his boots, his scarf, and heavy coat. I did the
same, and by the time we were ready we heard shouts and
the crack of whips. We harnessed Axel to the sled, and
proceeded slowly in the direction of the sounds, which
came, as we presently saw, from a company of farmers,
out thus early to plough the road.
After they had passed, we sped along merrily in the
cold, morning twilight, and in little more than an hour
reached the post-house.COPYRIGHT, I898, I899

A MOST original and interesting writer is George MacDonald,
who was born in 1824, in a little town in Scotland, soime thirty
miles or more above Aberdeen. He received a university education
and entered the ministry.  Like all Scotchmen, he dearly loves
his native land, and during all of
his life has been a deep student
of Scottish life and scenery.:  Years ago Mlr. -MacDonald was
obliged to give up regular preachI:::~                   ing on account of his health. He
began to describe the Scottish life
young people.
His fairy tales, especially "At tlhe Back of the Nortlh Wind,"
"Tlle Princess and the Goblin," and "'The Princess and Curdie,"
make fascinating readinig for children, and are full of beautiful
fancies.
This genial Scotch author has made thousands of friends all
over the world who have never seen his face. They have been
won to him by his writings, which appeal to their hearts and
stimulate them to better things.
Mr. MacDonald is tall, of a fine figure and dignified presence,
and has a handsome, striking face with a grave but sweet expression. He speaks with a Scottish accent. He preaches now and
then, but most of his time is devoted to literary work, which was
taken up as a recreation whllen his health failed.-48 65 &amp;SAID the wind to the moon, "I will blow you out.
You stare
In the air
Like a ghost in a chair,
Always looking what I'm about.
I hate to be watched; I will blow you out."
The wind blew hard, and out went the moon.
So deep
On a heap
Of cloudless sleep,
Down lay the wind, and slumbered soon,
Muttering low -' I've done for that moon."
He turned in his bed; she was there again!
On high
In the sky
With her ghost eye,
The moon shone white and alive and plain;
Said the wind - "I will blow you out again."
He blew, and he blew, and she thinned to a thread.'One puff
More's enough
To blow her to snuff!
One good puff more where the last was bred,
And glimmer, glum will go the thread,"-*9 66 8..He blew a great blast, and the thread was gone;
In the air
Nowhere
Was a moonbearn bare;
Far off and harmless the sky stars shone;
Sure and certain the moon was gone!
The wind took to his revels once more.
On down,
In town,
Like a merry-mad clown,
He leaped and halloed with whistle and roar.
"What's that?' The glimmering thread once more.
He flew in a rage -he danced and blew;
But in vain
Was the pain
Of his bursting brain;
For still broader the moon-scrap grew,
The broader he swelled his big cheeks, and blew.
Slowly she grew--till she filled the night
And shone
On the throne
In the sky alone,
A matchless, wonderful, silvery light,
Radiant and lovely, the queen of the night.-- 67.Said the wind -" What a marvel of power am I!
With my breath,
Good faith,
I blew her to death,
First blew her away right out of the sky,
Then blew her in; what strength am I!"
But the moon knew nothing aTout the affair;
For high
In the sky
With her one white eye,
Motionless, miles above the air,
She had never heard the great wind blare.
THE MOUSE AND THE MOONBEAM.
(Abridged.)
From " A Little Book of Profitable Tales," published by Charles Scribner's Sons.
Copyright, 1889, by Eugene Field.
EUGENE FIELD is a writer who belongs to every one. The East
and the West both claim him, and he has written as much for
children as for older people.
His writing was so largely the expression of a warm, loving
heart that no one could be left out or forgotten in the songs that
sprang from its depths.
He was born in the city of St. Louis, in September, 1850.
At the death of his mother, when Eugene was six years old,
he and his brother Roswell were taken to Amherst, Mass.,-_)  6 8  bl*
where their cousin cared for them like a mother. Eugene was a
happy, loving boy, very fond of pets. He had an odd name for
every cat, dog, or bird, and talked with them as if they understood
him. In after years he gave his
children just such odd pet names.
His early education was received at Amherst. He was but
an ordinary scholar, but had a
marked talent for drawing and
would often spend an hour decorating a letter with elves and'I      brownies. His father was a great
student, and the boys at one time
carried on a correspondence with.him  in Latin.  After studying
at Williams and Knox Colleges,
Eugene joined his brother at the University of Missouri, and there
finished his education.
After a trip abroad, he was married to Miss Comstock, the sister
of a college friend. He now began work in earnest on a newspaper
in St. Louis, becoming quite famous in his line of writing. In
1883 he went to Chicago, where he remained the rest of his life.
His poetic talent was very slow in showing itself, the first poem of
any merit being written when he was thirty. His earlier writings
were on the comic line, and it was not until after the publication of
"Little Boy Blue" that the deeper fountains of his genius became
apparent.
Unlike most writers, he loved to have others near him while he
worked. He delighted in Nature, but wished some dear companion
close at hand to share his pleasure in her. Many were the boyhood
rambles he took over the hills about Amherst, and in later life his
eye was quick to notice and delight in the changes in the landscape
about him. He made friends everywhere, but was at his best in
his family. Much of his tenderest verse is full of bright pictures
of his home life. Mr. Field died in 1895.-46 69 8'.dlg'ni fled        pas'ttur age

1. WHILST you were sleeping, little Dear-my-Soul,
strange things happened; but that I saw and heard them,
I should never have believed them. The clock stood; of
course, in the corner, a moonbeam floated idly on the
floor, and a little mauve mouse came from the hole in the
chimney corner and frisked and scampered in the light of
the moonbeam upon the floor.
The little mauve mouse was particularly merry; sometimes she danced upon two legs and sometimes upon
four legs, bfit always very daintily and always very
merrily.
2. "Ah, me!" sighed the old clock, "how different
mice are nowadays from the mice we used to have in the
good old times! Now there was your grandma, Mistress
Velvetpaw, and there was your grandpa, Master Sniffwhisker,- how grave and dignified they were!
"Many a night have I seen them dancing upon the
carpet below me, but always the stately minuet and
never that crazy frisking which you are executing now,
to my surprise - yes, and to my horror, too."
"But why should n't I be merry?" asked the little-8 70 ~8LMAUVE MOUSE.nl    I In  
MAUVE MOUSE.
mauve mouse. " To-morrow
is Christmas, and  this  is
Christmas eve."
"So it is," said the old
clock.  "I had really forgotten all about it.  But,
tell me, what is Christmas
to you, little  Miss Mauve
Mouse?"
3.'"A great deal to me!"
cried the little mauve mouse.'"I have been very good a
very long time: I have not
used any bad words, nor have
I gnawed any holes, nor have
I stolen any canary seed, nor
have I worried my mother
by running behind the flour
barrel where that horrid trap
is set. In fact, I have been
so good that I'm very sure
Santa Claus will bring me
something very pretty."
This seemed to amuse the
old clock mightily; in fact,
the old clock fell to laughing-4867 1 6O'so heartily that she struck twelve instead of ten, which
was exceedingly careless.
4. "Why, you silly little mauve mouse," said the old
clock, 1" you don't believe in Santa Claus, do you?"
"Of course I do," answered the little mauve mouse.
"Believe in Santa Claus?  Why should n't I?  Did n't
Santa Claus bring me a beautiful butter-cracker last
Christmas, and a lovely gingersnap, and a delicious rind
of cheese, and - and - lots of things? I should be very
ungrateful if I did not believe in Santa Claus, and I
certainly shall not disbelieve in him at the very moment
when I am expecting him to arrive with a bundle of
goodies for me."
5. "But if you believe in Santa Claus, why aren't you
in bed?" said the old clock.
"That's where I shall be presently," answered the
little mauve mouse, " but I must have my scamper, you
know. It is very pleasant, I assure you, to frolic in the
light of the moon;- only I cannot understand why you
are always so cold and so solemn and so still, you pale,
pretty little moonbeam."
"Indeed, I do not know that I am so," said the moonbeam. "But I am very old, and I have traveled many,
many leagues, and I have seen wondrous things. Sometimes I t-ss upon the ocean, sometimes I fall upon a
slumbering flower. I see the fairies at their play, and I-4 72 8e.hear mothers singing lullabies. Last night I swept across
the frozen bosom of a river."
6. "How strangely you talk," said the old clock.
"Now, I'11 warrant me that, if you wanted to, you could
tell many a pretty and wonderful story. You must know
many a Christmas tale; pray, tell us one to wear away
this night of Christmas watching."
"I know but one," said the moonbeam. "I have told
it over and over again, in every land and in every home;
yet I do not weary of it. It is very simple. Should you
like to hear it?"
"Indeed we should," said the old clock; "but before
you begin, let me strike twelve, for I should n't want to
interrupt you."
7. When the old clock had performed this duty, the
moonbeam began its story:--
"Upon a time --so long ago that I can't tell how long
ago it was --I fell upon a hillside. It was in a far distant
country; this I know, because, although it was the Christmas time, it was not in that country as it is wont to be in
countries to the north. Hither the snow king never
came; flowers bloomed all the year, and at all times the
lambs found pleasant pasturage on the hillsides.
" The night wind was balmy, and there was a fragrance
of cedar in its breath. There were violets on the hillside,
and I fell amongst them and lay there. I kissed them-e 73  e&lt;and they awakened.'Ah, is it you, little moonbeam?'
they said, and they nestled in the grass which the lambs
had left uncropped.
8. " A shepherd lay upon a broad stone on the hillside;
above him spread an olive tree, old, ragged, and gloomy.
The shepherd's name was Benoni. Wearied with long
watching, he had fallen asleep; his crook had slipped
from his hand.
" Upon the hillside, too, slept the shepherd's flock. I
had counted them again and again; I had stolen across
their gentle faces and brought them pleasant dreams of
green pastures and of cool water-brooks.
"' Ah, is it you, little moonbeam?' quoth the violets.'You have come in good time. Nestle here with us, and
see wonderful things come to pass.'
"'What are these wonderful things of which you
speak?' I asked.
9. "'We heard the old olive tree telling of them tonight,' said the violets.
"'Do not go to sleep, little violets,' said the old olive
tree,'for this is Christmas night, and the Master shall
walk upon the hillside in the glory of the midnight
hour.'
" So we waited and watched; one by one the lambs fell
asleep; one by one the stars peeped out; the shepherd
nodded and crooned and crooned and nodded, and at last1Sue~t T. imttb
WITH THE
LOVE OF HIS WIFE-4 74 &amp;he, too, went fast asleep, and his crook slipped from his
keeping.
"Then we called to the old olive tree yonder, asking
how soon the midnight hour would come; but all the
old olive tree answered was,'Presently, presently,' and
finally we, too, fell asleep, wearied by our long watching, and lulled by the rocking and swaying of the old
olive tree in the breezes of the night.
10. "' But who is this Master?' I asked.
"' A child, a little child,' they answered.' He is called
the little Master by the others.  He comes here often
and plays among the flowers of the hillside. Sometimes
the lambs, gamboling too carelessly, have crushed and
bruised us so that we lie bleeding and are likely to die;
but the little Master heals our wounds and refreshes us
once again.'
"I marveled much to hear these things.'The midnight hour is at hand,' said I,'and I will abide with you
to see this little Master of whom you speak.' So we
nestled among the verdure of the hillside, and sang songs;
one to another.
11. "' Come away!' called the night wind;' I know a
beauteous sea not far hence, upon whose bosom you shall
float, float, float away out into the mists and clouds, if
you will come with me.'
"But I hid under the violets and amid the tall grass,- 75 8*that the night wind might not woo me with its pleading.' Ho there, old olive tree!' cried the violets;' do you
see the little Master coming? Is not the midnight hour
at hand?'
"' I can see the town yonder,' said the old olive tree.'A  star beams bright over Bethlehem, the iron gates
swing open, and the little Master comes.'
12. "Two children came to the hillside.* The one,
older than his comrade, was Dimas, the son of Benoni.
He was rugged and sinewy, and over his brown shoulders
was flung a goatskin; a leathern cap did not confine his
long, dark, curly hair. The other child was he whom
they called the little Master; about his slender form
clung raiment white as snow, and around his face of
h0avenly innocence fell curls of golden yellow.
"So beautiful a child I had not seen before, nor have I
ever since seen such as he. And as they came together
to the hillside, there seemed to glow about the little
Master's head a soft white light, as if the moon had sent
A.ts tenderest, fairest beams to kiss those golden curls.
13. "' What sound was that?' cried Dimas, for he was
exceeding fearful.
"' Have no fear, Dimas,' said the little Master.'Give
me thy hand, and I will lead thee.'
" Presently they came to the rock whereon Benoni, the
shepherd, lay; and they stood under the old olive tree,-48768'13and the old olive tree swayed no longer in the night wind,
but bent its branches reverently in the presence of the
little Master. It seemed as if the wind, too, stayed in its
shifting course just then; for suddenly there was a
solemn hush.
"'Thy father sleeps,' said the little Master,'and it is
well that it is so; for that I love thee, Dimas, and that
thou shalt walk with me in my Father's kingdom, I
would show thee the glories of my birthright.'
14. "Then all at once sweet music filled the air, and
light, greater than the light of day, illumined the sky and
fell upon all that hillside.  The heavens opened, and
angels, singing joyous songs, walked to the earth. More
wondrous still, the stars, falling from their places in the
sky, clustered upon the old olive tree, and swung hither
and thither like colored lanterns. The flowers of the hillside all awakened, and they, too, danced and sang.
"The angels, coming hither, hung gold and silver and
jewels and precious stones upon the old olive, where
swung the stars; so that the glory of that sight, though
I might live forever, I shall never see again.
"When Dimas heard and saw these things he fell upon
his knees, and catching the hem of the little Master's
garment, he kissed it.
"'Greater joy than this shall be thine, Dimas,' said
the little Master;' but first must all things be fulfilled.'- 77.15. " All through that Christmas night did the angels
come and go with their sweet anthems; all through that
Christmas night did the stars dance and sing; and when
it came my time to steal away, the hillside was still beautiful with the glory and the music of heaven."
"Well, is that all?" asked the old clock.
"No," said the moonbeam; "but I am nearly done.
The years went on. Sometimes I tossed upon the ocean's
bosom, sometimes I scampered o'er a battlefield, sometimes I lay upon a dead child's face. I heard the voices
of Darkness and mothers' lullabies and sick men's
prayers, - and so the years went on.
16. "I fell one night upon a hard and furrowed face.
It was of ghostly pallor. A thief was dying on the cross,
and this was his wretched face. About the cross stood
men with staves and swords and spears, but none paid
heed unto the thief. Somewhat beyond this cross another
was lifted up, and upon it was stretched a human body
my light fell not upon.
"But I heard a voice that somewhere I had heard
before,- though where I did not know, - and this voice
blessed those that railed and jeered and shamefully entreated. And suddenly the voice called'Dimas, Dimas!'
and the thief upon whose hardened face I rested made
answer.
17. " Then I saw that it was Dimas; yet to this wicked-.3   78  9ecriminal there remained but little of the shepherd child
whom I had seen in all his innocence upon the hillside.
Long years of sinful life had seared their marks into his
face; yet now, at the sound of that familiar voice, somewhat of the old-time boyish look came back, and I seemed
to see the shepherd's son again.
"'The Master!' cried Dimas, and he stretched forth
his neck that he might see him that spake.
"' 0 Diinas, how art thou changed!' cried the Master,
yet there was in his voice no tone of rebuke save that
which cometh of love.
18. " Then Dimas wept, and in that hour he forgot his
pain. And the Master's consoling voice and the Master's
presence there wrought in the dying criminal such a new
spirit that when at last his head fell upon his bosom, and
the men about the cross said that he was dead, it seemed
as if I shined, not upon a felon's face, but upon the face
of the gentle shepherd lad, the son of Benoni.
"And shining on that dead and peaceful face, I bethought me of the little Master's words that he had
spoken under the old olive tree upon the hillside: Your
eyes behold the promised glory now, 0 Dimas,' I whispered,'for with the Master you walk in Paradise.'"
19. Ah, little Dear-my-Soul, you know --you know
whereof the moonbeam spake. The shepherd's bones are
dust, the flocks are scattered, the old olive tree is gone,-48 79 Stthe flowers of the hillside are withered, and none knoweth
where the grave of Dimas is made. But last night
again there shined a star over Bethlehem, and the angels
descended from the sky to earth, and the stars sang
together. in glory.
And the bells, - hear them, little Dear-my-Soul, how
sweetly they are ringing, --the bells bear us the good
tidings of great joy this Christmas morning, that our
Christ is born, and that with him he bringeth peace on
earth and goodwill toward men.

(sh)
1. MR. BOWEN came over from England more than
two hundred years ago, bringing his family with him.
The country was then covered with woods. Indians,
deer, wolves, and foxes had it pretty much to themselves.
There was one other house in the valley, and only one,
and that belonged to a man named Moore. Four miles
away, at the Point, there were some dozen or twenty
houses, a store, and a mill; no road between, only a-.)8 80 84blind pathway through the woods. Those woods reached
hundreds of miles.
2. Mr. Bowen had lived in this country a little more
than a year when his wife died, leaving three children,Philip, not quite eleven, Nathaniel, six, and Pol4y, three.
He hired a young girl to take care of these children
and to keep house for him. Her name was Florinda
LeShore.  She was born in France, but had spent the
greater part of her life in England. She was only fifteen
years old.
3. Florinda went to Mr. Bowen's house sometime in
November.  On the 29th of December, as Mr. Bowen
and Mr. Moore were saddling their horses to go to the
store, word came that they must start at once for a place
about fifteen miles away to consult with other settlers
as to what should be done to defend themselves against
the Indians.
So the two men turned their horses' heads in the
direction of Dermott's Crossing, and thought they should
make good time and be back by noon of the next day.
4. Two days and two nights passed, and they had
neither come nor sent any message. By that time there
was not much left to eat in either house. Florinda and
the children slept both nights at Mrs. Moore's. Mrs.
Moore's house was built of heavy timbers, and its doors
were oak, studded with spikes.-.9881 8.The Indians never attacked a strong house like that,
especially if guarded by a white man with firearms.
Mrs. Moore was a feeble woman. She had two little
children, and her brother was then living with her,- a
young man named David Palmer, at that time confined
indoors on account of having frozen his feet badly.
5. On the second morning Philip said to Florinda that
he would take his hand sled and go through the woods
to the store and get some meal and some bacon for themselves and Mrs. Moore. Florinda felt loath to let him go.
It was a long distance, the snow was deep,-no track,
and woods nearly all the way. But Philip said that he
was n't afraid; the oldest boy ought to take care of the
family; and at last Florinda said he might go. For,
unless he did, they might all starve, especially if there
should come on a heavy snowstorm.
6. Florinda spent the day in spinning and in other
work for the family. As soon as it began to grow dark,
Mrs. Moore sent her little boy over to inquire. Florinda
sent word back that Philip had not come, and that she
should wait until he did come before going over to Mrs.
Moore's.
After the boy had gone back, Florinda barred the door
and shut all the window shutters but one. She left that
open so that Philip might see the firelight shining through.
The children began to cry because Philip was out all-.8 82 8.--
alone in the dark woods, and Florinda did everything
she could to take up their minds. Nathaniel told afterward of her rolling up the cradle quilt into a.baby for
little Polly, and pinning an apron on it, and of her setting
him letters to copy on the bellows with chalk.
At last little Polly fell asleep and was put into bed.
Nathaniel laid his head on Florinda's lap and dropped
asleep there, and slept till she got up to put more wood
on. It was then nearly twelve o'clock. Nathaniel woke
in a fright. He had been dreaming about wolves, which
made him cry.
7. In the midst of his crying there came a tap at the
door.  Florinda made no answer. Then a voice said
softly, "Florinda?" It was the young man, David Palmer,
Mrs. Moore's brother. He had crawled all the way
between the two houses to see if they were safe and if
they would not come over. Florinda said no, that she
had plenty of work to do and was not afraid, and meant
to stay and keep a good fire for Philip.
The young man told her the window shutter ought to
be shut, to keep the light from shining out, in case any
Indians might be going through the woods; that when
Philip got within half a mile of the house he could keep
his course by the brook. Florinda closed the shutter. He

Nathaniel climbed up and looked through the knot hole,
and told Florinda he saw a fire in the woods. Florinda
said she thought not, may be it was the moon rising, and
kept on with her spinning. By and by he looked again,
and said he did see a fire and some Indians sitting down
by it.
Florinda left her wheel then and looked through,
and said yes, it was so. She kept watch afterwards,
and saw them put out the fire and go away into the
woods toward the Point. By this time it was pretty
near morning.
On the back side of the hut, near the fireplace, there
had been in the summer a hole or tunnel dug through to
the outside under the logs. It was begun by a tamne
rabbit that belonged to Nathaniel.
9. The children at play dug the hole deeper and wider,
and it came quite handy in getting in firewood. This
passage was about four feet deep. They called it the
"back doorway." When winter came on it was filled up
with sand and moss. No doubt Florinda planned exactly
what to do in case of an attack, as she spent the latter
