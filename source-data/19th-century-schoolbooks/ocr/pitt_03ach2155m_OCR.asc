integrity, have experienced a greater reverse of
fortune.

2. In very early life, he served as apprentice to
n tallow chandler ; but he soon found that cutting
wicks, and filling moulds, would never satisfy his
strong and inquisitive mind.

3. He had a great predilection for n seilor’e life.
He was eager to see mankind under all the va-
riety of appearances, which tnnnners, habits, and
costume, liave given them. A spirit of enterprise
was the first trait of character which developed
itself very strongly.

4. He read xtith eagerness accounts of cabin
boys, who had become admirals; of chimney-
aweepers converted into mayors of London; of
scholars, poor and _secluded in early life, whose
names had gone down to posterity, folliiwed by a
long wake of glory; and of rustick clerks, who,
by some fortunate venture at sea, had amassed a
splendid fortune.

5. Had his father encouraged his ropensity for
a seafaring life, he probably would are been an
industrious sailor, ti skilful pilot, and an economi-
cal and nclicious captain. Luckily for him, how-
ever, Mjr. Franklin thought best to thwart his
boyish inclinations ; and he lived to show all these
qualities in the cltarttcter of a philosopher and
statesman.

6. The twidity with which he dead all the
books that came in his way, induced his father (3
hind him an apprentice to an elder son, who was
then upprinter in Boston. In this trade, he made

JUVENILE, READER. 101

rapid proﬁciency, and was soon very useful to his
brother; unfortunately, however, they could not
agree together.

7. Benjamin had published some verses and
essays in his brother’s newspaper, which met wit-eh
considerable praise. This ﬂattered his youthful
vanity; and according to his own account of
their disagreement, he was as much to blame’ for

forwardness . and selfismportance, as his brother

was for severity.

8. Whatever might be the causes of complaint,
they became so irksome to him, that he absconded
from Boston, and oﬂered himself as a journeyman
printer in Philadelphia. -

9. Thetaccount of his ﬁrst visit to that city, af-
fords a striking contrast to his success in after life.
“ I was,” sayshe, “ in my working dress which
was covered with _dirt; and my pack! ,.s were
stuffed with shirts and stockings.”  

10. Fatigued and hungry, with very little money
in his purse, he roamed along the streets, untilshe
met a child with a loaf of bread. He eagerly in-
quired,where;.i_t was bought ; and having the ba-
ker’s pointed out to him, he purchased three large.
rolls,’ which he devoured as he walked, along’
through thcarprincipal streets.

11. After this refreshment, he followed a crowd
of well dressed people, who were all going the
same way, and veryfsoonfound himself in the in-
teriour of a Friends’ meeting-house.

12.,‘ 'Sucli:Qw‘as this ﬁrst introduction to thecity
of Phﬂadiélphia, Where his shrewdness and talent

102 coats’:

for business, soon made him a distinguished
citizen.

13. The great cause of Doctor Franklin’s rise
in the world was his habit of close obsen.'ation
upon men and things. His attention was always
awake, always interested in what was around him.

14. This led him to itwent his metallick kite,
with silken cords to draw lightning down from
the heavens; this led him to apply his knowledge
to a practical use, by the introduction of lightning
rods; and to this we owe the seritentious wisdom,
which every where pervades his writings. Per-
haps economy was it still more striking trait of his
charaeltet than shrewd discrimination.

15. Every child has read the story of the dear-
bought whistle; and most children have probably
ﬁgured to themselves how Benjamin Franklin
looked when he went home piping in the merri~
merit of his heart, and thinking how his brothers
and sisters would envy him the noisy plaything.

1.6. And then his look of disappoiritment and
vexation, when every one in the house laughed at
fit: Kurchaoe, and told liim he had paid “ too clear

is whistle.”

17'. This lemon seems to have made a. deep
imprmion upon him; for economy was the spirit
breathed from all his actions, and all his writings.
He was frugal in his own expenses; frugal in
hk systemof politicks; and frugal evenin his

18.  irmead of saying that it is diﬁcult
human doeplyinclebttobeindopendoutinhia

JL'VF.NII.E naansn. 103

integrity, and to avoid ﬂattering the rich, he says,
with peculiar brevity, “ It is hard for an empty
bag to stand upright.” Yet his economy seems
to have had no tinge of meanness.

19. He was always willing to lend money to
those who were entering life destitute; and when
those people wereable and willing to pay hitn, he
would often say, “ lend it to the first poor trades-
man you find, who is industriom and honest; and
tell him to lend it to another, as soon as; he is able
to spare it, In this way,witl1 a small sum of
money, I shall do good to the end of time.”

20. This extraordinary man was born in Bos-
ton, and he always said he owed his thirst for
knowledge entirely to the good education he re-
ceived from the free grammar schools of that in-
telligent eity. It wax Doctor Frank1in’e misfor-
tune, to have associated, in early life, with some
unprincipled characters, and to have read perni-
cious books.

21. It is impossible to go through the tempta~
lions of life, with any degree of safety, without
the protection of religious principle. Hence, we
find this learned man bitterly regretting, in his old
age, the errours of his misguided youth.

22. Let this teach the young, that they can not
be too careful in the choice of their companions,
and their books. And, if the laugh of the gay
and ﬁeshionable, should ever make industry and
economy a like oontemptible virtues, let them
rermmber tat Benjamin Franklin, 3. poor, hard-
 mechnnick, became bymeuuof than

104 coanh

very virtues, a philosopher, whose discoverieo were
useful and celebrated throughout Europe.

23. If they grow weary of application, and de-
spise frugality, let them think of a poor printer boy,
eating his roll of dry bread, in the streets of Philip
delphia, afterward ambassador to the Court of
France, welcomed to the most splendid of Parisian
saloons, and his gray hairs crowned with a. wreath
of laurel by the young and fair of that enthusiastiek
notion.

 

BEES.

1. As the children of Mrs. Johnson were, one
evening, at ten, eating some honey, the otrriovus
up rance of the honey~eomb induced them to
as their mother a great many questions about
bees

2. They knew how honc}' and wax were ob-
tained and preserved by bees, from reading Mina
Edgeworth’s book about little Frank, but they
 to know 3. great deal more; for they had
heard their father once talking with a gentleman
about the economy of bees, and they did not know
what  meant by economy of bees.

3. Mrs. Johnson told them, What was called
“ the economy of bees,” signiﬁed their admirwle
management of their work, and ﬁdupoml of them-
uelves into little partiw, the better to accomplish ‘n;
and also their submitting to be directed bypont boo.

which we distinguish by the name of Queen-bee,
from her commanding the whole hive.

4. The queen is easily distinguished from the
rest by the size and shape of her body. On her
depends the welfare of the whole community.
She is seen, at times, with 8. numerous retinue,
marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremi-
ty of her body into each of them, and leaving in
each an egg.

5. A day or two nﬂer this egg isdeposited, the
grub is excluded from the shell, having the
shape of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and ly-
ing softly on a bed of whitish coloured gelly, on
which it begins to feed. The neuter, or working
bees, then attend it with astonishing tenderness
and anxiety; they furnish it with food, and watch
over it with unremitting assiduity.

6. In about six days, the grub arrives at its full
growth, when its atlectionate attendants shut up
the mouth of its cell with wax, to secure it from
injury. The grub spins a silken lining all round
its cell, and then turns to e Chrysalis. In
about seventeen days it breaks through this
lining and the waxen lid, and comes forth aper-
{ect bee.

7. It is pleamnt to see the neuter bees, who
form only the labouring part of the eomiiiunity, in
the act of collecting the mealy dust of ﬂowers,
for the basis of their wax. i

8. They roll themselves in the ﬂower cup,tho
dust of which adheres to their heirs; then b ' -
ing their but over their bodiegtheyﬁﬂ with

106 case’:

two small baskets, or cavities edged with hairs,
appended to their hinder legs.

,9. As soon as the bee, thus laden, comes to
the hive, others meet it, and taking the dust from
its legs, swallow it; their stomachs being the
place where it is converted into wax, Wlllcll they
throw up and mould into ropcr form.. The
males are called drones ; they ave no stings, and
are always killed by the neuters about the month
of September.

10. The bees have many enemies; one is 3
little moth, that comes ﬂuttering about the mouth
of the hive, and lays its eggs there. From these
eggs, little caterpillars are hatched, which creep
in, and destroy the young bow in their cells;
then, when they are fully grown, they spin a
web, and turn to moths in the hive.

11. Another enemy is the sparrow, and he goes
very cunningly to work. He alights on the board
before the hire, and taps smartly against it with
his bill. A bee comes directly to the door, and is
snapped up by the sparrow. Wasps and hornets
also ill bees : they rip them open with their teeth
to suck out the honey, which is contained in a lit-
tle sack.

12. Bees keep their hire beautifully neat and
clean. Their industry and activity are truly
wonderful; not one in the whole hive, excepting
the drones, is unemployed; some are engaged in
gntherin r honey and wax; others in rebuilding
rotten ; some keip guard at the entrance of
Lhehivc, to prevent erinsectsgoing in; some

mvmunz amuse. 107

are employed in carrying out the dead, for when
one bee dies, the other bees will not allow the dead
body to remain in the hive.

13. The working bees, or neuters, are very
fond of their queen. If, by any accident, she be
destroyed, at first, the whole hive is thrown into
confusion, and all labour is suspended. But if
there be any eggs in the cell, they are able to pro-
duce another queen, for this bee, while young, is
fed by the others, with a kind of peculiar food, and
they ﬁt up a cell for her reception, much larger
than the cells of the neuters.

14. If a ueen be taken from a hive and kept
apart from t e working bees, she will refuse to
eat, and, in the comes of four or ﬁve days, will die
of hunger.

Well as its principal ornament. It is also not less
useful than ornarnerrtal ; for being suﬁiciently
large and busliy to cover the whole body, it serves
as an excellent defence against the inelemenciea
of the weather. It also greatly assists it in cling»
ing and adlreririg to trees.

4. I.rinnc.1:us, with other naturalists, assures us,
that in cr'os:;ei1rg a river, the squirrel places itself
upon :1 piece of bark, and erecting its (All in order

2. Coarse, brown, paper, used for wrapping, is
made of old ropes, old twine, andooften of woollen

of straw, to a considerab e extent.

INTRODUCTION.

OBSERVAIIONS  THE ,PRINCIPLES OF GOOD READING.

Tns art of reading with propriety, and speaking gracefully, is
a matter of so much utility and importance to man, in the various
departments of society, that it is greatly to be regsetted so neces-
sary a part of education should be almost totally neglected. That
a general inability to read and speak with elegance prevails,
is fully evinced both from private and publick performances.
The source from which this incapacity arises, is either natural
or artiﬁcial. ' , - , . \
To read with propriety is a pleasing and important attainment,
reductive of improvement both to the understandinrr and the
ieart. t It is essential to a complete reader, that he minutely per-
ceive the ideas, and enter into the feelings of the author, Whose
sentiments he professes to repeat; for how is it possible to rep-
resent clearly to others, what we have but faint or inaccurate
conceptions of ourselves "I _ ,,

,That the cause of badreading and speaking is not natural,
will appear evident by considering‘, that there are few persons,
if any, who, in private discourse, do not deliver their sentiments
with ‘propriety and force, whenever they speak in earnest. Here,
then, is an unerring standard ﬁxed for reading and speaking
justlyrand, forcibly; which is, to adopt the same easy and natural
mode to read and speak publickl y, as we use in private conver-
sation’. l —

"This natural mode would certainly be adopted, were we not,
in early life, taught a different way, with tones and cadences,
different ' from those which are‘ used in common conversation;
and this artiﬁcial method is substituted instead of the natural
one, in all performances at school, as well as in reading. To
correct, in some degree, this artiﬁcial manner, it will be necessa-
ry to unfold the real sources of our errours and faults in the art

made of an infusion of galls, oopperaa, and gum-
nrabick.

2. Ink used for printing, is made by boiling
linseed oil, and burning it a short time, and mixing
it with lnxnpblaok, with an addition of soap and

or appearance till some other means are used, such
as holding it to the fire, or rubbing something
over it.

THE HUMMIN GBIRD.

1. OF all the birds that ﬂutter in the garden, or
paintthe landscape, the hummingbird is the most
delightful to look upon, and the most inoffensive;
Of this charming little animal, there are six or
seven varieties, from the size , of a small Wren,

down to that of an hurnblebee. A European

would not readily suppose, that there existed any
birds so very small, and yet so completely furnish-
ed with a bill, feathers, wings, and intestines, exs
a_.ct.ly resembling those of the largest kind.

‘2. ’ Birds not so large as the end of one’s little
ﬁnger, would probably be supposed mere creatures
of imagination, "were they not seen in inﬁnite num-‘
hers, and as frequent as butterﬂies in a summer’s
day, sporting in the ﬁelds of America, frornﬂower
to ﬂower, and extracting‘ sweets with their little
bills.

3. The smallest humrningbirdis about the size
of a hazelnut. The yfeathers on its wings and tail
are black; .,but those on its body, and under its

wings, are of a greenish brown, with a ﬁne red

cast or gloss, which no silk- or velvet can imitate.
It has a small crest on its head, green at the bot-
tom, and as it were gilded at the top, and which

112 cosvﬁs

sparkles in the sun like a little star in the middle
of its forehead. The bill is black, straight, slender,
and of the length of a smell pin.

4. It is inconceivable how much these birds add
to the high. ﬁnishing and beauty of a. rich, luxuri-
ous western lniiclscnpe. As soon as the sun is
risen, the hummingbirds, of different kinds, are
seen ﬂuttering about the flowers, without ever
lighting upon them. Their wings are in such
to id motion, that it is impossible to discern their
no cure, except by their glittering.

5. They are never still, but continually in mo-
tion, visiting ﬂower after ﬂower, and extracting
its honey‘ as if with 8. kiss. For this purpose they
are furnished*with rt forky tongue, that enters the
cup of tl1e?ﬁo“it'er, and extracts its nectared tribute.
Upon this alone they subsist. The rapid motion
of their wings occasions: a htnnming sound, from
whence they have their name; for whatever di-
vides the air swiftly, must produce murmur.

6. The nests of these birds are also very curi-
ous. They are suspended in the air, at the point
of the twigs of an orange, rt pomegranate, or a
citron-tree; sometimes even in houses, if a small
and convenient twig be found for the purpose. The
female is the architect, while the trials goes in
quest of materials; such as cotton, ﬁne moss, and
the ﬁbres of vegetables. Of these materials a nut
is composed, about the size of a herrs egg cut in
two; It is admirably contrived, and warmly lined
 cotton.

7. ‘Thou are never more than two eggs found

JUVENILE READER. 113

in the nest ; these are about the Size of small peas,
and as white as snow‘, with here and-therera ye_l-
low speck. The male and the female sit upon
the nest by turns ; but the female takes to herself
the greater share. She seldom quits the nest‘,
except a few minutes in the morning and evening,
when thedew is upon the ﬂowers, and their honey
in perfection. During this short interval, the male
takes her place. y

8. The time of incubation continues twelve
days; at the end of which the young ones appear,
much about the‘ size of a blue-bottle ﬂy. They
are at first bare ; by degrees they are covered with
down; and, at last, feathers succeed, but lessbeau-
tifulgat first than those of the old ones. r T

Eatll.€f Labat, in his account of the mission
to Arneigca, says, “ that his companion found the
nest of? a‘i3hum1ningbi1'd, in a shed near the dwel-
ling-house"; and took it in, at a time when the
young ones were about ﬁfteen or twenty days old.
He placed_the1nin.a cage at his chamber window,
to be amused by their sportive ﬂutterings ; but‘ he
was much surprised to see the old ones, which
came and fed their brood regularly every hour in
the day. ‘ l “

10. “By tl)lS:§§l11eanS they themselves grew so
tame, that theywseldom quit the chamber; and,
without any constraint, came to live with their
young  All four frequently perched upon

their master’si hand, chirping as if they had been
at liberty abroad. He fed them with a very ﬁne
clear paste, made of wine, biscuit, and sugar.

11-A eons’:  

11. " They thrust their tongues into this paste,
till they were satisﬁed, and then ﬂuttered and
chirped about the room. I never beheld any
thing more_ agreeable,” continues he, “ than this
lovely little family, which had possession of my
companion’s chamber, and ﬂew in and out just as
they thought proper; but were ever attentive to
thegvoice of their master, when he called them. A

12. “ In this manner they lived With him above
six months; but, at a time when he expected to
see a new colony formed, he unfortunately forgot
to tie up their cage to the ceiling at night, to pre-

serve them from the rats, and he found in the,
morning, to his great mortiﬁcation, that they were

all devoured.”

RELIGION.

p ,1. RELIGION is the daughter of lieaven, parent
of our virtues, and source of all trueéiflicity ; she
alone gives peace and contentment, divestsr the
heart of anxious ca-res,,burs'ts on the mind a ﬂood
of joy, and sheds unmingled and perpetual sun»
shine in the pious breast, By Her the spirits of
darkness are banished from the earth, and angel-
ick ministers of grace thicken unseen, the regions
of mortality.  g

the cup ‘ofaﬂiiction, blunts the sting of death, and
wherever seen,‘fe1t, and enjoyed, breathesaround
her an everlasting spring.

3, IWould you Wish, amidst the great variety of
religious systems in vogue, to make a right dis-
tinction, and prefer the best? Recollect the char-
acter of Christ; keep a steady eye on that uni-
versal and permanent good will to men, inwhich‘
He lived, by which He suffered, and for which He
died.

4, . What now would you expect from a mind
-so purely. and habitually benign? Is it possible
ztosuppose, that at heart thus warm and wide ‘could

1"harbcur a narrow wish, or utter a partial senti-y

étnent ?,7 ~ Mostiluckily, in this point, full satisfaction
is in every mane -power.

5. Go, search the religion He has left, to the
bottom ; not in those artiﬁcial theories, which
ihavedone it the most essential injury ;‘ or in their
-manner, who assume’ His name, but overlook His
egraniple, and who are for ever talking about the
tiiiirits of His death, at the expense of those virtues
which adorn His life,

6. Not in these wild and romantick notions,
which, to make us christians, would make us fools;
but in those inspi1'ed wgitings, and in those alone,
which contain His geniiine history, and His ‘bles-
sed gospel; and which, in the most peculiar and
extensive sense, are the words of eternal life.

7. Read the" scriptures, then, as you would read
the last will of some deceased friend, in which
you expected a large beguest; and. tell me;~in the

1 16 r.:oBn’s

sincerity of your soul, what you see there to cir-
cumscribe the social affectinxis, to crush the risings
of benevolence: or tn check the generous eﬂltsions
of humanity. ltiittleness of mind and nnrrownem
of temper, were certain] no parts of nttr Snviour’s
character; and He enjnins notliingg which He did
not uniformly and minutelj; exemplify.

8. Strange, that an institution, tvliieh begins
and ends in benignity, should he prostituted to
countenance the \\'()rl<i11g:3.0f malevolent passions,
should produce animosities among those whom it
was intended to unite; but there is not at corrup-
tion in the hunian liezim which has not sometimes
borrowed the garb of religion.

9. Cliristinnity, limwever, is not less precious to
the honest, becattse knaven and fools have abused
her; and let bigots and skepticlgggay what they
please, she softens and enlarges heart, warm:
and impregnates the mind of man, as certainlv‘,
and essentittlly, as the sun does the earth.

MODESTY.

1. Mome;s'rx' is one ofwtlie chief ornaments of
youth, and has ever been” esteemed a presagte of
rising merit; it covers a multitude of faults, and
doubles the lustre of every virtue. which it seems

to hide; the perfections of men being like 

ﬂawers which appear mare beautiful, when their
lave: are a little contracted and folded up, than

JUVENILE READER. 117

when they are full blown, and display themselves
without any reserve to the view.

2. Modesty is a. polite accomplishment, and
generally an attendant upon merit. It is engaging
to the highest degree, and wins the hearts of all
our acquaintance. On the other hand, none are
more disgusting in company, than the iinpudcnt
and presuming.

3. The man who commends and speaks well
of himself on all occasions, we generally dislike.
On the contrary, he who studies to conceal his
own deserts, who does justice to the merit of others,
who talks but little of himself, and that with mod-
esty, makes a favourable impression on the r-
‘eons with whom he is conversing, captivates tiiﬁir
minds. and gains their esteem.

4. Modesty, however, widely differs from an
awkward bashfulneas, which is as much to be
condemned as the other is to be applauded. A
gentleman who is acquainted with life, enters a
room with gracefulness, and with a modest as-
surance addresses the company in an easy and
natural manner, and without the least embarraes~
ment.

5. This is the characteriotick of good breeding,
and a very necessary knowledge in our intercourse
with men ; for one of inferionr talents, with the
behaviour of a gentleman, is frequently better re-
ceived than a man of sense, with the address and
manner: of a clown. i

THE FORCE OF CONSCIENCE.

1. A .ri:Wr.LLr:rt, a men of reputation and con
siderable wealth, having occasion, in the way of
his business, to travel at some distance from the
place of his abode, took with him a servant, in
order to take care of his portmnnteau.

2. He had with him some of his best jewels,
and at large sum of money, to which his servant
was liltewise privy. The master liming occesion to
dismount on the road, the servant, wnteliiug his
opportunity, took it pistol from his rnasteﬁs saddle,
and shot him dead on the spot; then riﬂing him
of his jewels and money, and hanging 8. large
stone to his neck, he threw him into the nearest
canal.

3. With this booty he made off to a distant part
of the country, where he had reason to believe that
neither he nor his master was known. There
he began to trade in a very low way at ﬁrst, that
his obscurity might screen him from observation,
and in the course of several years, seemed to rise
by the natural progress of husinem, into wealth
and consideration; so that this good fortune ap-
peared at once the effect and reward of industry
and virtue.

4. Of these he connterfeited the appearance so
well, that he grew into great credit, and married into
a reputable family; and, by laying out his sudden
 discreetly, as he saw occasion, and joining to
Ill 8 universal affability, he was admitted to n

share of the government of the town, and rose
from one post to another, till at length he was
chosen chief ITlZlg‘lEll‘ZllC.

5. In this oﬁice he maintained a fair character,
and continued to fill it with no small up lause,
both as governour and as a judge, till one try, as
he sat on the bench with some of his fellow judge:
a. criminal was brought before him, who was ac
cused of murdering his master.

6. The evidence came out full, the jury brought
in their verdict, that the prisoner was guilty, and
the whole assembly waited for the sentence of the
president of the court with great suspense. Mean-
while, he appeared to be in unusual disorder and
agitation of mind; his colour often changed; at
length he arose from his seat, and coming down
from the bench, placed himself just by the unfor-
tunate man at the bar, to the astonishment of all
the people.

7. “ You  before you,” said he, addressing
himself to his fellow judges, “ you see before you
a striking iustaxice of the just awards of heaven,
which this day, after thirty years concealment,
presents to you a. greater criminal than the man
just now found guilty.” Then he made 0. full
confession of his guilt, and all its ttggmvations.
“ Nor can I feel,” continued he, “ any relief from
the agoniee of an mvakenetl conscience, but by
requiring that justice be forthwith done against me,
in the most publick and eolernn manner.”

8. Amuzement seized the whole assembly, ‘and,
especially the minds of his fellow judges. They,

The principal obgects to be attained 13 reading are th§:§‘:
1. To acquire know edge. .2. To assist .t e memory to retain
this knowledge, when acquired; and, 3. To communicate it to
others. ' The first‘ two are answered by silent reading; but to
communicate knowledge to others, loud readin is necessary.
The structure of written language hasbeen suﬂieiently regarded

THE ZEBRA.

1. Tim zebra is one of the most beautiful of
animals. Nothing can exceed the regularity of
its colours, \\‘l1l(3ll, in the male, are white and
brown, and in the fcrnttle white and blank, ranged
in alternate stripes over the whole body, in’ a. style
so beautiful and OI'I)8.I1‘lCl1l.£!l, that it might, at the
first oi l1t,:seem the effect of the most exquisite
art, rtrger than the genuine production of nature.
The thighs, legs, and even the tall, are beautiful
in the same style of elegance; and every part is
equally decorated.

2. This animal has hitherto been esteemed ah-
aolutely tintnnieable. Some naturalists suppose,
that, with proper management, it might be con-
verted to the mme uses as the horse. This opino
ion, however, is but ill supported by experimce,
for those that have been caught have generally
dbcovered lit degree of viciousnws, that has ren-
dered it unsafe to approach them.

3. A zebra, which was long kept in France,

was exceedingly wild at his arrival, and was neva

ﬁnmpletely tamed. He was, indeed, broken for

Jev.exu.u xtzwen. 121

the saddle, but his stubbornness rendered t
precaution 11cceeear_\'; and two men were ob iged
to hold the bridle while another was riding hiin.

4. A beautiful male zebra, at Exeter-chmlge,
London, which was afterward burnt to death, by
the mischievous not of ti. monkey setting ﬁre to
the straw on which he lay, appeared to have lost
his native wildness, and was so gentle, no to outlet
8. child of six years old to sit quietly on his back,
without exhibiting the least sign of displeasure.
He was fainilinr even with etrnngers, and received
these kinds of cnressee, that are usually given to
the horse, with evident satisfaction.

5. The zebra is only found in the southern‘ 
gione of Africa, from Abyesinia to the Cape 
Good Hope, and from Mozambique to Congo.
Vihole herds of these animals are sometimes seen
feeding; but on account of their ewiftneee, they
are exceedingly diﬁicult to take. The Dutch of
the Cape colony have employed every means to
subdue and tame the zebra, but without success.

  

 

THE OSTRICH.

1. True gigantick creature generally measures
seven feet from the top of its head to the
three of which are allowed for the head and neck,
as from the back it is only four; but when it is
stretched out in a line, it measures six feet from the
head to the end of the bgclkg each wing, without

1% coats’:

the feathers, is about a foot and a. half in length;
but when they are on, they are at least double.

2. The feathers upon the tail and wings, are
held in such high estirrmtion, that the creature in
hunted merely for their sake. Its appetite is more
inordinate than can possibly be conceived. It
will greedily devour leather, glass, iron, stones, tin,
lead, and cork. The eggs of this animal weigh
three pounds.

3. Of all orea.tures that-make use of their logs,
the ostrich has the Cllilfittttel‘ of being the ﬂeetest.
Ilia wings, as well as his legs, keep in motion like

two oars to Walt him along; and did he k for-

ward in 3. direct line, instead of n‘eirct1lar c use,
  would find no difﬁeulty in outstripping his
pursuers.

  

 

THE EAGLE.

1. The royal, ‘or golden eagle, is the largmt
and noblest of all the class of birds, that bears the
name of eagle; and as the lion obtains preemi-
nence among animals, so the eagle is allowed to
pomeos it among birds.

2. It weighs between twelve and thirteen
pounds; and the wings, extended, measure up-
wards of seven feet. Both the sight and smelling
are remarkably acute.

3. The lega are yellow, short, and very strong,
three inches in circumference, and feathered to tho

JUVENILE neanna. 128

vet feet. The toes are covered with large scales,
at armed with most formidable claws, the mid-
dle of which are two inches in length.

4. The eagle is naturally a solitary animal ;
and it is as extraordinary to see two pairs of eagles
on the same mountain, as two lions in the same
forest. The eagle’s nest is usually built in an in-
accessible cliff of a rnountain or rock.

5. The strength of the eagle is great. With
his wings he is able to strike a blow, which will
kill a man. He soars to greater heights than any
other bird, and carries to his lofty nest, geese,
lambs, and sometimes children four or ﬁve years
old, to be devoured by his young ones.

6. The bald eagle, which is the emblem of the
United States, Mr. Wilsott describes thus :

7'. “ Formed by nature for braving the severest
cold; feeding equally upon the produce of the sea,
and of the land ; possessing powers of ﬂight capa~
ble of outstripping even the tempests themselves ;
unawcd by anything but man.

8. “ From the ethereal heights to which he
no-ate, looking abroad, at one glance, on an im-
measurable ex anse of forest, ﬁelds, lakes, and
ocean, deep be we him; he appears indiﬁerent to
change of seasons; as in a few minutes he can

from summer to winter, from the lower to the
igher regions of the atmosphere; and thence
dwcend at will to the torrid or frozen  of
the earth. He is therefore found at all seasons in
the countries which he inhabit.”

THE MIMICK, OR MOCKING BIRD.

1. Tmcnsz is a. bird in some parts of our coun-
try, which is thus described in Wilson’: Orni-
thology:

2. The plumage of this bird has nothing gaudy
or brilliant about it; but his ﬁgure is well propor-
tioned, and even ha..nds.omc.

3. The ease, elcgaxice, and rapidity of his move-
ments, the animation of his eye, and the intelli-
gence he displays in listening, and laying 11 les-
sons from almost every species of the feat cred
creation, within his liearing, are really surprising.

4. To these qualities we may add that of 9.
voice, full, strong, and musical, and capable of al-
most evory modulmion. In the measure and ac-
cent, he faithfully follows his originals. In force
and sweetnea of exp:-ewion, he greatly improves
upon them.

5. In his native groves, while.  are al-
teady vocal with at multitude of Warblers, his; ad»
mimble song rises pm-eminent over every com-
 Tho ear can listen to his musick alone,
to which that of the others seems a mere accom-
paniment. , '

6. i Neither is his strain altogether timitativo.
His native notm, which are easily distinguishabm
 and full, and varied seemingly beyond

13. This excessive fondness for variety, how-

ever, in the opinion of some, injures his song.   His

elevated imite;tions~ of the brown thrush, are“?-*f1'e~
qurently interrupted by the crowing of cocks‘; " and

ment, that the sole performer, in this singular con~
cert, is the admirable bird now before us.

 

CHOCOLATE.

1. Crrocormrr; is made of the kernel of the
cocoa-nut, with other ingredients, generally a little

These are called cloves.

SALT.

1. Common: salt is a substance used for season-
ing certain kinds of food, and for the preservation
of meat; and, it is used for other purposes.

2. Salt is found almost every where. It is
found native in the earth, or it is produced‘ by
evaporation and crystallization from water im-
pregnated with saline particles.  

3. The water of the ocean contains salt. Springs
of water have been found in various parts of the
World, which also contain salt.

4. A great quantity of Water is collected, and
placed so that the water evaporates and leaves the
salt: sometimes the water is boiled away in ket~
ties, and the salt is left.

53 There are many salt mines composed of
pure rock ‘salt, deep under ground. The most
celebratedare those of Cracow in Poland.

NITRE.

2. It is continually formed in inhabited placer,

I1\"1‘P.ODL'C’I‘ION. xiii

others, however, maste ‘s have used the stops as marks of tones
also. That they can not answer this end is certain, for the tones
preceding auses and rests in discourse, are numerous and vari-
ous, accor ing ‘to the se_nse of the words, the emotions of the
mind, or the exertions of fancy; each of which would require a
distinct, and can not be represented by so small a number as four
or five, which are used as stops. _ The masters have given what
they callproper tones to their pupils in reading, by annexing
artiﬁcial tones to the stops, which no way correspond to those
which are used in discourse. The comma, semicolon, and colon,
are - pronounced in the same tone; and only diﬁ'er in point of
time, as two or three to one; while the period is markedby a
dilferent tone. The one consists _in.a uniform elevation, and
the other in as uniform depression of the voice, which occasions
that disagreeable monotony, which so generally prevails in read-
in , and which destroys all propriety and force in speakinrr.

%Iere', then, is the chief source of that unnatural manner of
reading, which necessarily defeats all eleganceand gracefulness
in private and publick reading and speaking, for the sight of the
stops as naturally excites the tones which the pupil was early
taught to associate with them, as the sight of the words excites
their pronunciation; and thus the habit of reading will only
serve to conﬁrm him in the faulty manner which he has acquired.

To give rules for the management of the voice in reading, by
which the necessary pauses, emphasis, and tones, maybe diseov~
cred and put in practice, is not possible. , After all the directions
that can be offered on these points, much will remain to be tau ht
by the living instructor: much will be attainable by no ot er
means than the force of example inﬂuencing the imitative owers
of the learner. Some rules and principles on these hea s-will,
however, be found useful, to prevent erroneous and vicious modes
of utterance ; to give the young reader some taste of the subject;
and to assist him in acquiring a just and accurate mode of de-
livery. The observations which we ‘have to make, for these
purposes, may be comprised under the following heads: -PROPER
LOUDNESS or VOICE; DISTINCTNESS ; SLOWNESS ; PROPRIETY or
PRONUNCIATION ; rmpnasrs; TONES; muses; and MODE or
READING VERSE.

PROPER. LOUDNESS OE‘ VOICE.

The first attention of every person who reads to others, doubt-
less, must be, tolmake himself be heard by all those to whom he
reads. He must‘ endeavour to ﬁll with his voice the space oc-
cupied by the company. This power of voice, it may be thought,

2

 sheltered from rain, and in all situations
where animal matters are decomposed.

3. It is of great use in the arts. It is the prin-
cipal ingredient in gunpowder, and is useful in
medicines, in preserving meat, butter, tizc. It is
a. white substance, and has an acrid, bitter taste.

RICE.

1. Rice is a plant which is cultivated in all
warm climates, and the grain forms a large por-
tion of the food of the inhabitants.

2. In America, it grows chieﬂy on low moist
land, which’ can be overﬂowed.

3. It is a light food, and seems intended by the
wise and benevolent Creator to be the proper food
of men in warm climates.

 

NIAGARA RIVER AND FALLS?

1. NIAGARA river connects Lake Erie with
Lake Ontario, is about thirty miles in" length, and
forms a part oimthe western boundary between the
state of New York and Upper Canada.

2. The falls of this river, seven miles from Lake
Ontario, are the greatest curiosity in this or my
other 

3. To have I tolerable idea. of this stnpendoun

ruvemnn READER. 131

cataract, it will be necessary to know, that the
country which contains Lake Erie is elevated
about three hundred feet above that which con-
tains Lake Ontario.

4. The slope which separates the upper and
lower country, is generally very steep, and in many
places it is nearly perpendicular.

5. Some have conjectured, that from the great
length of time, the quantity of water, and the dis-»
tanoe which it falls, the rocks have been worn
away seven miles from Lake Ontario, up the river
towards Lake Erie, by which this astonishing
chasm is formed. .

6. This river is one of the largest in the world,

and yet the whole of its waters is discharged with

great velocity down this chasm, by a fall of it hun-
dred and fifty feet perpendicular. W

7. It is not easy to bring the imagination to
correspond to the greatness of the scene. A river
extremely deep and rapid, and that serves to drain
a great part of the waters of North America into
the Atlantick Ocean, is here poured precipitately
down a ledge of rocks_, that rises, like a. wall, across
the whole bed of its stream. The river, 8. little
above, is nearly three -quarters of a mile broad;
and the rocks, where it grows more narrow, and
over which the water falls, are four hundred yards
over.

8. The direction of the rocks is not straight
across, but hollowing inwards like a horseshoe;
sothettliecatnracqwhichbends to the Ilnpoof

132 men’:

the omtacle, rounding inwards, presents a kind of
theatre, the most tremendous in nature.

9. Just in the middle of this circular wall of
waters, a little island, that has braved the fury of
the current, presents one of its points, and divides
the stream at the top into two parts; but they
unite again long before they reach the bottom.

10. The noise of the falls is frequently heard
at the distance of twenty or thirty miles; and the
fury of the waters, at the termination of their fall,
is inconceivable. A perceptible tretnuloue motion,
is felt at the distance of several rode around the
falls.

11. The dashing of the water produces a mist,
that new to the very clouds; and which forms a
most beautiful rainbow, when the sun shines.

12. Just below the great fall, the water and
foam may be seen pulled up in large spherical
ﬁgurw, which burst at the top, and pr ‘eat a
column of the spray to a. great height, an then
subside, and are succeeded by others which burst
in like manner.

13. The fog or spray, in the winter season, falls
upon the neighbouring trees, to which it congeals,
and ezrhibits a very beautiful crystalline appear-
ance.

14. It is very difficult to descend into the chasm
of this stupendous cataract, on account of the great
height of the banks; but after a person has de-
scended, he may go up to the foot of the falls, and
take shelter behind the descending column of
water, between that and the precipice, where there

THE TWO MEN AND THEIR BARLEY‘

I, A NUMBER of years ago, two neighbours-,“ it
a newly settled part of the country, were travelling
together, each with a -load of barley to carry to the
malt—l1ouse.. At that place, the barley was to be
inspected, and, ‘if found good, to be ground into
malt for the s making of beer.

2. For a considerable distance, these travellers
foundtthegdride. more pleasant than they had ex-
pected.  They pconversed in a social manner on
different, subjects, as the various streams, .cleared

farms, andycottages, they passed ;, and among other«

_tl,};ings, related the various opinions they hadheard
concerning the malt-house to which they were
going. l

L 3. As they advanced, doubts V began to arise in
their minds, respecting the course they should
take; for the country Was hilly, and diﬁerent
paths were seen, which appeared to lead in the
same general direction. The travellers had exam-
ined the geography and , maps; but neither of
them had ever passed that way b;eg:o1‘e.

p l  After the best iinformatio11‘7‘?5t’§‘l1 ey could get,
 came, at last, to a fork in the roads, where
they found themselves unable to agree. , One

said, the riglit hand, and the‘ other said the left,’

12

134 coBB’s

was the proper course; and ﬁnally, each took his
own way, in the firm belief, that his neighbour
was wrong.

5. As it happened, both men arrived at the
malt-house, nearly at the same time. Their
meeting was very unexpected to both; and they
still wished to know, which of the two ways was
the better; but, on inquiry, they found that, though
there were diﬁF'erent roads, and it was of some con»
sequence for travellers to make a wise choice, yet,
the main question, at that place, was, not which
one of a dozen ways they come, but whether their
barley was good.

6. We may learn from this story, that if peo-

ple agree, in the main points, they should not get

angry and abuse each other, as they sometimes
do, because they cannot think alike in triﬂing
things; or that if two persons, both meaning to do
right, should differ in opinion, respecting very im-
portant aﬂairs, it would be proper for each to en-
joy his own way of thinking, and not quarrel
about it.

 

r THE WHISTLE.

1. WHEN I was a child, at seven years old, my
friends, on a holyday, ﬁlled my pockets with cop-
pers. I went directly to a shop where they sold
toys for children; and being charmed with the
sound of a whistle, that I met by the way in the

hands of another boy, Iyoluntarily oﬁ'ered all my
money for one.

2. Ithen came home, and went whistling all
over the house, much pleased with my whistle,
but disturbing all the family.

3. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, under-
standing the bargain I had made, told me I had
given four times as much for it as it was worth.

4. This put me in mind what good things I
might have bought with the rest of my money;
and they laughed at me so much for my folly,
that I cried with vexationg and the reflection
gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me
pleasure. - V

5. This, however, was afterward of use to me,
the impression continuing on my mind; so that
often, when I was tempted to buy some unneces-

sary thing, I said to myself—-do not give too much

for the whistle; and so I saved my money,

6. As I grew up, came into the world, and ob-
served the actions of men, I thought I met with
many, very many, who gave too much for their
Whistle.

7’. ‘When I saw any one too ambitious of court
favours, sacriﬁcing his time in attendance on
levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and per-
haps his friends, to attain it, I iliave said to my-
self-—this man gives too much for his whistle.

8. When I saw another fond of popularity, con-
stantly employing himself in political bustles,
neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by

136 e~oeB’s

that neglect~—he pays indeed, says I, too much
for his Whistle.

9. If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind
of «comfortable living, all the pleasure of doing good
to ‘others, all the esteem of his fellow-citizens, and

the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of J

accumulating \vealth~———poor man, says I, you do
indeed pay too much for your whistle.

10. VVhen I meet a man of pleasure, sacriﬁcing
every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his
fortune, to more corporeal sensations—-~mistal:en
man, says I, you are providing pain for yourself
instead of pleasure: you give too much for your
Whistle.

11. If I see one fond of ﬁne clothes, ﬁne furni-
ture, ﬁne equipage, all above his fortune, for
which he contracts debts, and ends his career in
prison-—-alas! says I, he has paid dear, very dear,
for his whistle. ~

12. When I see a beautiful sweet tempered
girl, married to an ill—natured brute of a husband
-r--what a pity it is, says I, that she has paid so
much for a whistle.

«13. In short, I conceived that great part of the
miseries of mankind were brought upon them by
the false estimates they had made of the value of
things, and by their giving too much for their

FILIAL AFFECTION.

1., AMONG. all human duties, none have « a
stronger claim to our attention than ﬁlial affection;
for next to our Maker, our parents are entitled to
our veneration, gratitude, and esteem. ;

2. Yet with all these claims upon their children’s
affection, how often has the unhappy parent the
misery of ﬁnding impudence substituted in the place
of humility, arrogance in that of dependence, and
\ndifl'erence' in that of duty; and instead of their
;hildren’s submitting with docility to the expe-
rience of a. e, behold them vain through ignorance,

and presuiiriptuous through folly !

3. It unfortunately happens, that the age which -

stands in most need of advice, should be the most
prone to reject it. In China, so great is the vener-
ation and respect in whichthe parental character
is heid, that an instance of its authority being dis-
puted, is absolutely unknown.

4. The virtue of ﬁlial tenderness is so strongly

‘exemplified in the following instance, that one need

only read it,‘to catch the virtuous sentiment, and
imitate the pious example.

5. A Roman lady of rank, was accused of a.
crime against the state, for which she was tried
and condemned‘ to suffer death. a The keeper of
the prison, who was ordered to be her executioner,
not only felt a great degree of repugnance to the
oﬁice, but was absolutely incapable of performing
it; yet aware that his own life depended upon the

12*

138 coBB’s

discharge of his duty, he durst not attempt pre.
serving her existence.

6. 'I‘hus circumstanced, the cruel idea, which
had compassion for its foundation, occurred, of
letting her remain without sustenance, knowing
that she must then die from Want, and -that he
should escape the pain of becoming her execu-
tioner.

7. A man in that situation, who could shrink
from the discharge of his duty from motives ‘of
humanity, it is natural to suppose, might easily
be subdued by tenderness, and overcome by per-
suasion.

8. It is no wonder that he yielded to the en-
treaties of the daughter, and permitted her to visit
her unhappy mother; though he was under the
necessity of searching her, to prevent her being
the conveyer of any kind of nourishment. ,

9. Several days elapsed without any striking.a.l-
teratipn in the unfortunate mother’s appearance.
This circumstance called forth the keeper's as-
tonishment so much, that he began to imagine the
daughter had contrived some means of eluding his
vigilance, and therefore ‘resolved to watch them
when the daily meeting took place.

10. He did so, and beheld a sight that called
forth his pity and admiration. An affectionate
daughter was presented to his view, lengthening
out her parent’s existence, by that nourishment
nature had given for the support of ~ 'her own oil'-
spring, and endeavouring to avert the decrees of

JUVENILE nnsnrsn. I39

justice, by the nutritious qualities of the  or
tenderness!

11. The humane keeper instantly ﬂew to her

judges, described theinteresting‘ scene he had be-
held, and had the happiness of procuring a pardon
for the unfortunate mother. V y    
12. The senate were so struck with this lin-t
stance of amiable tenderness, that they ordered a
temple to be erected to ﬁlial piety, on the spot
where the prison stood, and both mother and
daughtersto be maintained at the publick expense.

 

ON STUDY.

1. STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and
for ability. Their chief use for delight is in pri-
vacy, and retirement; for ornament, is in dis-.
course; and for ability, is in the judgement and
disposition of business.

2. For expert men can execute, and perhaps

judge of particulars, one by one; but the general;

counsels, and plots, and marshalling of gaﬂhirs,
come best from those who are learned.

3. To. spend too much time in studies is sloth;
to usethem too much for ornament, is aﬁ"ectation,;
to make judgement wholly by their rules, is the
humour of a scholar.

4. They perfect nature, and are perfected by
experience; for natural abilities are like natural
plants, which need pruning by study; and studies

is wholly a natural talent. It is, ina great measure, the gift of
nature; but it may receive considerable assistance from art.
Much depends, for this purpose, on the proper pitch and manage-
ment "of the voice. Every person has three pitches in his voice ;
thetmen, the MIDDLE, and the Low one. The high, is that
which he uses in calling aloud to some person at a distance.
The low is, wlienhe approaches to a whisper. The middle is,
thatwhich he employs in common conversation, and which he
should encrally use in reading to others. For it is 21- great mis-
take to imagine that one must take the highest itch of his voice,
in order to be well heardin a large company. his is confound-
ing two things which are different, loudness or strength of sound,
with the key or note on which we s oak. There is a variety of
sound within the compass of each ey. . A speaker may there-
fore render his voice louder, without altering the key: and we
shall alwaysbe able to give most body, most perseverin-g‘ force of
sound, to that pitch of voice, to which, in conversation, we are
accustomed. \Vl1ereas, by settinrr out on our highest pitch or
key, we certainly allow ourselves fess compass, and are likely to
strain our voice before we have done. We shall fatigue our-
selves, and read with pain ; and whenever a personspeaks vvith
ppin to himself, he is always heard with pain by his audience.
ct us therefore give the voice full strength and swell of sound;
but always pitch it on our ordinary speaking key. It should be
a constant rule never to utter a greater quantity of voice than
we can afford without pain to ourselves, and without any extraor-
dinary effort. As long as we keep within these bounds, the’
other organs of speech will be at liberty to discharge their sever-
al ofﬁces with ease; and we shall always have our voice under
command. Butdwliciiever we transgress these bounds, we give
up the reins, and have no longer any manacrenient of it. It is a
useful rule, too, in order to be well heard’, to -cast our eye on
some of the most distant persons in the company, and to consider
ourselveis as reading to them. ‘Va naturally and mechanically
utter our words with such a degree of strength, as to make our-
selvfcs be heard by the person whom we address, provided he is
within the reach of our voice. i As this is the case in conversa-
tion, it will hold also in reading to others. But let us remember,
that in reading, as Well as in conversation, it is possible to offend
by speaking too loud. This extreme hurts the car, by making
the voice come upon it in rumbling, indistinct -masses.
By the habit of reading, when young, in a loud and vehement
manner, the voice becomes ﬁxed in a strained and unnatural
key ; and is rendered incapable of that variety of elevation and

teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom
won by observation.

6. Read not to contradict and refute, or to be-
lieve and take for granted, or to ﬁnd talk and dis»
course, but to weigh and consider. Some books
are to be read only in part; others to be read, but

THE UNGBATEFUL GUEST.

1. Pntnrp, king of Macedon, is celebrated for
an act of private justice, which does great honour
to his memory. A certain soldier in the Macedo-
nian army, had, in various instances, distinguished
himself by extraordinary acts of velour, and had
received many marks of Philip’s approbation and
favour.

2. On at particular occasion, this soldier enn-

JUVENILE READER. 141

barked on board a vessel, which was wrecked by
a violent storm; and he was cast on theshore,
helpless and naked, with scarcely any appearance
of life.  

3. A Macedonian, whose lands were contigu-
ous to the sea, came opportunely to be a witness
of his distress; and, with the most humane and
charitable tenderness, ﬂew to the relief of the un-
happy stranger. e

4. He bore him to his house, laid him in his
own bed, revived, ‘cherished, and comforted him;
and, for forty days, supplied him freely with all
the necessaries and conveniences which his lan~
guishing condition could require.

5. The soldier, thus happily rescued from death,
was incessant in the warmest expressions of gra‘ti~
tude to his benefactor; he assured him of his interest
with the king, and of his determination to obtain
for him, from the royal bounty, the noble returns
which such extraordinary benevolence had merited.
He was at length completely recovered, and was
supplied by his kind host with money to pursue
his journey.’ a

6. After some time, the soldier presented hhn-
self before the king ; he recounted his misfortunes ;
he magniﬁed his services: and this inhuman
wretch, who had looked .with an eye of envy on
the possessions, of the man by Whom his life had
been preserved, was’so devoid of gratitude, and
of every humane sentiment, as to request that the
king would bestow upon him the house and lands,

M3 cone’:

where he had been so tenderly and kindly enter-
mined.

7. Unhappily, Philip, without examination,
procipitately granted his infamous request. The
soldier then returned to his presenter, and repaid
his goodmm by driving him from his settlement,
and taking immediate pOS8cSSiOI1 of all the fruits
of his honest ixidttstry.

8. The poor mam, stung with such an instance
of unparalleled ingfratitttde and inmnsibility, boldly
determined, instead of submitting to his wrongs,
to seek relief; and, in :1 letter addressed to Philip,
re resented his own, and the soldihﬁs conduct, in
a Vvely and affecting manner.

9. The king was instantly fired with indigna-
tion. He ordered that ample justice should be
done without delay; that the possessions should
be immediately restored to the man whose charita-
ble offices had been thus horribly repaid; and, to
show his ahhorrence of the deed, he caused the
soldier to be seized, and ta liave these words brand-
ed on his fore.head«-~“ The Ungrateful Guest.”

THE HORSE.

1. THE various excellences of this noble animal,
the grandeur of his stature, die elegance and pro-
Etion of his paI1s,the beautiful smoothness of

' skin, the variety and gracefulneen of his mo-

JUVENILE READER. 143

tiqns, and, above all, his usefulness, entitle him to
as precedence in the history of the brute creation.

2. A horse is a very sagacious creature; he

knows his own stable, and can smell it afar off;
when he sees or smells any horse that he knows,
he neighs to it, and often gets an answer in the
same way. _ .

3. This animal never forgets any place where
he has once been ; and he will ﬁnd his way home

from a. great distance, even by a road on which he-

has never gone before. '

4. He is also a very docile creature; and, when‘.
taught to carry a person on his back, his rider gov-g
erns him by his sense of feeling, that is, by the

curb, which he gives him with the bit, by a touch
with his spurs, or by a stroke with his whip.

5. The horse is quicksigl1t'ed.; he can see
things in the night, which his rider can not per-
ceive; but when it is too dark for his sight, his
sense of smelling is his guide. When he smells a.
ditch, a pond, or a lake, he will start back, to the
great surprise of his master.

6. A horse sleeps much less than we do. He
requires so much time to feed in, that (if We‘, llow
for the hours which he has to work, often twelve

in the day, a11d_;;so'rnetimes more) he seldom 
above three or «four hours out of the twenty-four ;.
get he is‘ not soon tired, though his work is often.

ard, and his time of fasting often long.
7. In, summer, horses, in the country, feed on
grass, or on grassgand oats ; and in winter,'they
eat oats, corn, and hay. When grazing in the

144 cQB.B’S

pasture, they always choose the shortest grass,'he~
cause, it is the sweetest ; and, as they have cutting
teeth in both their jaws, they can eat very near the
ground.

8. The age of a horse may be known by his
teeth until he is six or seven years old, but with
certainty no longer; yet horse-dealers, by an art
Well known to themselves, can make a horse ap-
pear to be four or ﬁve years old, when he is not
more than three, or three and a half. By this
trick, they not only deceive the buyer, which is
very Wrong, but also ruin the horse, by making
him subject to harder labour than his strength can
bear.

9. A horse, if properly treated, commonly lives

to the age of twenty—ﬁve or thirty years; and,
when he dies, his skin is taken off, and sold to the
tanner, to be made into leather for shoes and boots,
arid for many other purposes. . The leather made
from it, however, is not so strong as that made of
the calf—skin.
T -10. The ﬂesh of a horse is not good for us to
eat ; his mane and tall are made into very good
coverings for chair bottoms and sofas, and answer
a good purpose for ﬁshing-lines.

- 11. There, are many varieties of the horse.
Among those in a domestickstate, we ﬁnd the
racer, slender, with elegant limbs, and capable of
great speed; the truck horse, heavy and clumsy,
but very strong and useful; the carriage horse,
with his beautiful and smoothskin, polished by
high feeding; and the charger,?or war horse.

12. Horses are found in a wild state, in the ex-
tensive plains ,.of' ‘Arabia and Africa, where they
range without control. They are also found
wild in the immense plains west of the Mississippi
river, and in South America, having been original-
1y brought from Europe by the Spaniards,

13. In these plains, the wild horses may be
seen feeding together in herds of several hundreds,
and sometimes thousands; one of them acting as
a sentinel to give notice of the approach of an ene-
my. This he does by a kind of snorting noise,
upon which they all set off at full speed, making
the very ground tremble with the noise of their
boots. The wild horses of Arabia are esteerned
the most beautiful in the world.-

dc ression which constitutes the true ‘harmony of utterance‘, and

ords ease to the reader, and pleasure to the audience. This
unnatural ‘pitch of the voice, and disagreeable monotony,'.are
most observable in persons who were taught to read in large
rooms; who were accustomed to stand at too great a distance,
when reading to their teachers_; whose instructers were very
imperfect in their hearing; or who were taught by persons that
considered loud expression as the chief requisite in forming ‘a
good reader. These are circumstances which demand the seri-
ous attention of everyone to whom the education of youth is
committed.

DISTINCTNESS.

- In the next p.Iace,to being well heard and clearly understood,
distinctness of articulation contributes more than mere loudness
of sound. The quantity of sound neeessar to ﬁll even a large
space, is smaller than is commonly imagine ; and, with distinct
articulation, a person with a weak voice will make it reach far-
ther,'than the strongest voice can reach without it. . To this,
therefore, every reader ought to pay great attention. He must
give every sound which he utters, its due proportion; and make
every syllable, and even every letter in the word which he pro-
nounces, be heard distinctly; without slurring, whispering, or
suppressing any of the proper sounds.

An accurate knowledge of the simple, elementary sounds of
the lanrruage, and a facility in expressing them, are so necessary
to distmctness of expression, that if the learner’s attainments
are, in this respect, imperfect, (and many there are in this situa-
tion,) it will be incumbent on his teacher to carry him back to
these primary articulations, and to suspend his progress till he

become perfectly master of them. It will be in vain to press him»

forward, with the hope of forming a good reader, if he can not
completely articulate every elementary sound of the language.

nee nsemzia or SLOWNESS.

In order to express ourselves distinctly, moderation is requisite
with regard to the speed of pronouncing. Precipitancy of speech
confounds all articulation, and all meaning. It is scarcely ne-
cessary to observe, that there may be also an extreme on the_op-
posite side. It is obvious that a lifeless, drawling manner of
reading, which allows the minds of , the hearers to be alwa ‘s out-

.runn'ing t'he.s'peaker, must render every such performance insipid

and ﬁitiguin . i But the extreme ‘of reading too fast is much more
common, an requires the more to be guarded against, because,

THE DOG.

_ 1. THE dog is very bold,‘sagacion‘s,a‘nd affec-

will die to defend him or it.

2. He listens to his voice, obeys his commands,
partakes of his pleasures, and follows his steps;
and he will not forsake him «while he lives.

the terrier, the pointer, are names of diﬂbrent spe»
cies of dogs.

4. The mastill is a large and strong dog. He
is kept to protect houses and gardens. He does
not molest those who do not disturb him ; but he
warns, them to keep away, by his loud and tar.
rifick barking.

5. The mastiﬁ‘ is not so playful as some other
dogs are, but he knows how to punish the imparti-
nence of an inferiour.

6. The out is the useful servant of the farmer.
He lcnotvs his nmster’s own ﬁelds, and cattle. He
takes care of his ma.sster’s ﬁelds, and does not
trouble himself with those of others. He walks
peaceably about among his master’s cattle, but he
barks furiously at strangers, and drives them away.

7. The shephercfs dog knows every one of his
master’s sheep. He will not suffer any strange
sheep to come among them. He takes care of
them when the shepherd is absent, assists to drive
them to the ﬁeld, and conducts them back to the
fold.

8. The hound runs more swiftly, or he is more
ﬂeet than any other species of the dog. He is
used in hunting the deer, the fox, and the ham.

9. The spaniel swims well. He is fond of the
water, is a beautiful animal, his hair is

feet and a half, while that of the largest mastiff is

scarcely known to exceed three feet.’ The colour
of the wolf is a mixture of black, brown, and iron

_ gray. He’ is much stronger than the dog. a

appetite for animal food is the most voracious, and
Whose means of satisfying it are most easily obtain-

«can ﬁt him for pursuing, overtaking, and con-
quering his prey; and yet his appetite is so great,
that he frequently dies for Want of food. ,

3. Though naturally dull and cowardly in his
disposition, necessity seems to make him hold, and
he will undauntedly attack any animal, that is
immediately under the protection of man, particu-
larly lambs and sheep; and when the calls of

both men and women.

1. THEI1EU.a1'4e three species of the bear ’; the
White, the black, and the brown bear.‘ i

2. 'The.;white,bear lives very far to the north,
where it is almost always winter. He is much
stronger, larger, and ﬁercer, than either the brown»,
or the black bear, and sometimes measures no less
than twelve feet in length.

3. During winter, he lies buried in snow, in a
stage of‘ torpor; in summer, he lives chieﬂy on
ﬁs .

4. The brownbear. is a ﬁe1'ce, carnivorous ani-
mal; so extremely voracious, that he not only at-
tacks ﬂocks and herds, but even devours carcasses,
when in a putrid state, .

5. The black bear can never » be brought to
taste of ﬂesh, nor has he ever been knoxvn to, at-
tack any.;animal for the sake of devouring it.

6. Roots and ‘vegetables of every kind co-nstitute

his principal food ; but his favourite repast is honey
and milk, Heisextremelycommon in the forests
of America.

7. The form of the bearis rude andimissliaped;
His 2- body is covered with a coarse ‘ and‘ shaggy
hide, Hist tail is very short ; not more than four

or five inches.  length.

8. His? legs are thick and“In1_1SCL1l€LT€;~ and the
long and ﬂat soles of this paws, tho’ugh‘they en'a+
ble him to tread with peculiar ﬁrmness, render
his pace at the same time very awkward and

capable of grasping, somewhat in the manner of a
hand, enabling him to climb with "great facility
the most lofty trees. H t

ful blow. He can rear himself at pleasure .on his
hinder paws, and, seizing his adversary in his
embrace, can easily squeeze thestrongest man to

1.1. ‘The -bear delights in solitude, and ichooses
his dentin the precipice of lonely mountains, or in

‘the deep recesses of some gloomy forest. Here he

passes the greater part of the winter, without ever
stirring abroad. g p

  12. He has not, like the ant and the bee, laid
up any hoard of provisions for the"season,but be-

iingwvery fat,‘ he ‘seems to live by his fatness;

1'3.’ Theunder parts of his paws, too,‘are at that
time full of a white milky juiice, and ' ‘duiring his
retirement, he is said to derive considerable nourish-
ment from sucking them.

14. When he ﬁrst crawls abroad again in
spring, he is extremely lean and feeble, and. his
feet are so tender that he ﬁnds it diﬂicult tomove.

THE LION.

1. , ,'I,‘HEllion is one of the most terribleof al

animals.’ Some lions are saidto be nearly. ﬁve‘

feet high, and between nine and ten from thenose.
to the _end_ of the back. The ordinary height,
.l1_o,wev_er, isibetween three and four feet; the .lion'.-
ess is not so‘ large. 1
2. He .belongs to hot countries; to Asia and
Africa. ,The Africans use the lion’s skinto sleep
upon. , Tgheglipn loves hiskeep_er, a1_id,allOW$ him
to play with him ; he is not cruel to some animals.
Little dogs have been put into his den, and he has
given; them food, and played with them. The
lion has been known to live seventy years. J
3. The general colour of the lion is yellow. .His
look, is .b,.0ld, hisgait proud, and his voice terrible.
His face. is broad, and some have thought that it
resernblesithe human kind. It is surrounded with
a,\.'ei'yf_lor1,gi'n'1ane, which gives it a most majesticlc
appearance.
‘ 4. Thetop of the head, the temples, the checks,

the under jaw, the neck, the breast, the shoulders, ,

and the hinder part of the legs, are all, frirnished
with long hair, while the other part of the body is
Covered iw_ith_very short. hair. i

5. His teeth ar_e terrible, and his paws like those

156 coBs’s

of the cat. His eyes are bright and ﬁery, nor
even in death does this terrible look forsake them.

6. He prowls about for food by night, and bold~
ly attacks all animals that come in his way. The

lion, produced under the burning sun of Africa, is

of all creatures the most undaunted.

7. Those that are bred in more temperate coun-
tries, or near the top of cold lofty mountains, are
far less dangerous, than those which are bred in

the valleys.

a 8. Pierce and formidable, as the lion appears,
he seems instinctively to dread the attacks ofman ;
and in those countries, where he is frequently op»
posed, his ferocity and courage gradually decrease.

e '9. This alteration in the animal’s disposition,

proves at‘ once that he is capable of "being tamed;
and, in fact, nothing is more common than for the

keepers of wild beasts to amuse themselves by

playing with the lion, and even to chastise him
without a fault ; yet the creature bears it all with
calmness. A '

f 10. The lion, on the whole, is a generous mind-
ed beast, and has given frequent proofs both of the
courage and magnanimity of his disposition.

11. ‘He has often been seen to‘ spare the lives
of those animals that have been thrown him to
eat, to live with them in habits of sociability and
friendship, and willingly. to share with them the
food that was given for his own support.

  12. Another superiority, which thelion possesses’
over every other animal of the carnivorous kind,

is, that he kills from necessity more than choice,

mvr—:Nu.n READER. 157

and never destroys more than he is able to con-
aume.

THE TIGER.

1. The tiger is a native of Asia, occurring from
China and Chinese Tartary to Armenia, but
chieﬂy frequenting the hot climates of India and
the Indian Islands, particularly the hilly and wood-
& districts ; lurking in thickets, from which it is-
sues to spread its ravages all around, attacking the
ﬂocks and herds, unterriﬁed by the sight or resist-
ance of man, and closing even with the lion, in
such fierce encounters, that the combatants have
been known to fall together.

2. When undisturbed, the tiger plunges his
head into the body of his victim, and quatie large
draughts of blood, the sources of which are getter»
ally exhausted before his thirst is allayed.

3. The tiger, though very beautiful in form and
colour, is one of the most odious of all creatures.
Though he is generally ranked next to the lion,
he is destitute of those qualities for which that
animal is admired.

4. He is ﬁerce without provocation, and cruel
without necessity. Tliough glntted with slaughter,
he is never satisﬁed; but still continues the carnage,
and seems to have his courage inﬂamed by not
meetin with resistance.  

5. he tiger is the only species of qundrupeds,

whose spirit nlmolntely refu.~:sestol)otal1‘1ed. Neither
force nor restraint, neitlior cruelty nor kindness,
makes the sliglitest impression on his stubborn
heart.

6. Ho snaps at the hzmd which supplies him
with food, with the sonic ferocity as that by which
he is chastised.

7'. The tiger is a. tremendous animal. His
strength is anmzring. Wlion he has killed any
large animal, such as it butlhlo, or horse, he carries
it to :1 remote port of the forest, for the purpose of
devouring it with the greater ease; and bounds
along with re. rapid motion, unchecked by tho

THE ELEPHAKT.

1. Tr-tr: elephant, (1 native of Asia and Africa,
is the largest, the storongeot, the most sagacious,
and the most docile, of all wild beasts. The usual
height of this nnsig;htly creature is from eight to
twelve. or fourteen feet.

2. The colour is nearly hlack ; the eyes; which
are very small, are lir«:l_\.3, bright, and expressive;
tbhood ears are broad, and long, in proportion to the

y. M

3. It has two long ivory msks, thicker towards
tho head than a. stout mans ann, and a trunk,
which it can contract or lengthen, as need requires.

4.  trunk is as useful to the animal as our

JUVENILE READER. 159

hands are to us. With this singular organ‘ it can
take up the smallest object; it serves itself with it;
and, in case of an attack, ﬁghts with it. It can
also untie knots of ropes, and open and shut gates.

5- The legs of this stupendous quadruped are

like columns of from twelve to eighteen inches in
diameter, and from four-to six feet high. Theffeet
are short, and divided into ﬁve toes each, and are
armed with nails of a horny substance, but which
are so covered with skin, that they are sca.rcely
visible.
  6. Elephants appear to know more than any
other brute animal; they are kind to those who
treat them Well ; but they hurt or kill those who
injure them.

7. Theselephant, in a state of nature, is neither
ﬁerce nor mischievous. It is peaceable, mild, and
brave; and exerts its powers only in its own de-
fence, or in defence of those of its own kind, with
Whichit is social and friendly.

8. In a state of conﬁnement, elephants have
been known:/to live a hundred and thirty years. i

9. Elephants often assemble in large troops;
and as they march, which is mostly in quest of
food, the forests seem to tremble under them.

10. In their passage they bear down the branches
of trees, Which, together with roots, herbs, and
leaves, are their common food they have no ob-
jection, however, to grain and fruit, but will not eat
either ﬁsh or ﬂesh.

11. In a state of captivity, they will drink ale,

when it has grown into a habit, few errours are more difficult to
be corrected. To ronounce with a proper degree of slowness,
and with full and c ear articulation, is necessary to he studied by
all, who wish to become good readers; and it can not be too
much recommended to them. Snch a pronunciation gives vv eight
and dignity to the subject. . It is a great assistance to thevoice,
by the pauses and rests winch it allows the. reader more easily‘ to
make; and it enables the reader to swell all his sounds, both
with more force and more ‘harmony.

PROPRIETY or PRONUNCIA'i‘I_OZ\‘.

After the fundamental attentions to the pitch and manage-
ment of the voice, to distinct articulation, and to a proper degree
of slowness of speech, what the young reader must, in the next
place, study, is propriety of pronunciation; or, giving to every
word which he utters, that sound which the best usage of the lan-
guage appropriates to it, in opposition to broad, vulgar, affected,
or provincial pronunciation. This is requisitebothfor reading
intelligibly, and for ‘reading. with’ correctness and case. In:
structions concerning this article may be best given by the
teacher. But there is one observation, which it may not be im-
proper here to make. In the English language, ‘every word
which consists of more syllables than one, has one accented syl-
lable. ~ The accents rest sometimes on the vowel, sometimes on
the consonant. Thegenius of the language requires the voice
to mark that syllable by astronger percussion, and to pass more
slightly over the rest. Now, after we have learned the proper
seatsof these accents, it is an important rule,‘ to give every word
just the same accent in reading as in common discourse. Man
persons err in this respect. VV hen they read to others, and wit
solemnity, they pronounce the syllables in a different manner
from what they do at other times. They dwell upon them and
protract them; they multiply accents on the same word; from
a mistaken notion, that ‘it gives gravity and importance to their
subject, and adds to the energy of their delivery. VVhereas
this is one of the greatest faults that can be ‘committed in pro-
nunciation: -it makes what is called a pompous or mouthing
manner ;‘ and gives an artiﬁcial, affected air to reading, which
-detracts greatly both from its agreeableness and its impression.
, Sheridan and ‘Walker have published dictionaries, for ascertain-
ing the. true and best ronunciation of the wordsof our language.
By attentively consu ting them,'particularly “ Walker’s Critical
Pronouncing Dictionary,” the young reader willbe much assisted

wine, and spirituous liquors; for which, indeed,
they seem to linve a particular predilection.

12. Froin the eleplmnts, that have been ex-
hibited in this country, we know that they are very
observing, and judge very correctly of the good, or
the ill treetiiient which they receive.

13. He is sometimes seized with a kind of
hrensy, which renders him extremely formidtu
le; so that, on the first symptoms of madnem,

he is commonly killed to prevent mischief : yet, in
these ﬁts, he has oﬂen been known to distinguish
his benefactors; so strongly are gratitude and
xmgnanixnity imprewed on the nature of this as-
tonisliing mass of animated matter.

14. The elephant lives’ at peace with the other
inhabitants of the forest. His great size and
strength render him an object of terrour; as with
such power and such eagocity, neither the lion,
nor the tiger, can contend with any prospect of‘
success.

THE CAMEL.

1. Tim: camel is a. native of Arabia, and is
chieﬂy conﬁned to that and the adjacent countriw,
where it lies, from time immemorial, been used in
traveteing those immense deserts of burning sand.

2. These deserts are impassable to every other
guedruped except the dromedary, which, although

istinguished by it different name, and by having

JUVENILE READER. 161

two   hunches: on its back, while the camel has

only one, is supposed to be originally of the same

race.

3. Neither fatigue nor thirst Wears out this
strong and patient animal. Horses and -mules
could not carry the same burdens, or endure the
want of water, as the camel does. God has ﬁtted
him ‘for the countries Where he has placed him,
and adapted him to the service of mankind.’ « .

,4. In Turkey, Arabia, Persia, and Egypt, their
whole commerce is ‘carried on by means of these

tiseful’ animals.

5.. Of‘ all the. quadrupeds with which the earth
is replenished, thisis the most tame and submis-
sive. , He kneels down to be loaded and unloaded,
and, eveniivhen overburdened, often ‘rnak.esi;the
most piteous .cornplaints, without offering the least
resistance., ' The camel carries a load of three ‘or
four hundred pounds. ‘

. . 6. ’When the camel is loaded, he -trots about
twenty-ﬁve miles in a ‘day; but when he carries
only a man upon hisback, he can travel one hun-
dred and ﬁfty miles in a day.

  7. Thecamel is, to the Arabian, what the rain-
deer is to the Laplander. Its milk is rich and nu-
tritive; its ﬂesh, when young, -is, excellent .-food,

wholesome and . invigorating; and its hair, or-

ﬂeece, ‘ which ,falls- off always in the spring, is
manufactured into ‘ﬁne stuffs, and almost--every

article necessary for clothing, bedding, and: the

covering of their ‘ tents. ,
.8. To comprehend the full value of this animal,
1 4*

162 coBB’s

we must ﬁgure to ourselves a country without
vex‘-dure and without water, Where a clearsky and
burning sun above, (from which no friendly shade
affords a shelter,) parches every living creature
with. intolerable thirst ; while an immense expanse

of scorched sands beneath, presents to the eye a ,

dreary scene of barren uniformity, in which no ob-
ject reminds the traveller of the existence of ani-
mated nature. Such are those immense deserts
Which. the camel and the dromedary. alone can
traverse.

9. In viewing the singular conformation of this
animal, we can not fail to trace the evident marks
which it bears of a regular design, inan organiza~
tion «so wonderfully adapted to the purposes for
which he is used, and to the place which he is ap-
pointed to hold in the system of animated nature.

10. His feet are peculiarly adapted to the soil on
which he is to tread. They‘ are liable to be in-
jured by travelling on stones; and he can not
well support himself on moist and slippery clays ;
-but his broad hoofs are perfectly calculated for
travelling on the dry and parched sands of Arabia.

11. But the peculiar and distinguishing charac-
teristick of the .camel, is its faculty of abstaining

‘from water longer than any other animal; a. proper»

ty so necessary in those immense deserts.

12. For this the God of nature has provided by
a singular internal conformation ; for, besides the
four stomachs which he has, in common with
other ruminating animals, he’ is also furnished
with a ﬁfth bag, that serves as a reservoir for wa-

n:vE2m.n READER. 163

ter, where it remains uncorrupted, and without
min ling with the other alirnents.

1‘ . ‘When the camel is pressed with thinit, or
has need of water to moisten his eliment, in cheuu
ing the end, he draws up into the stomach, or even
into the throat, 8. part of this reserve. Furnished
with so capacious and so convenient a receptacle,
he can take a prodigious quantity of water at once,
and rernnin inziny days without drinking.

1-1. It is remarkable, that all attempts to intro-
duce either the camel or the reindeer into other
countries than those to which they originally be-
long, have completely failed. Both the one and
the other appear evidently designed by Providence
for the service and solace of man, in those countries
where no other animals are qualiﬁed to supersede
their utility. e

15. Camels live forty or fifty years. There is
a. kind of camel in South America, called a lama.

THE PANTHER.

1. Tm: panther is a. native of Africa. He is a.
fierce, ferocious animal, of the size of a large dog;

THE LEOPARD.

e 1‘. Tm»: leopard is a. native of Africa and Asia.
It is larger than the ounce, opd loss than the pan-
ther. This animal is so mpocious as to Spare
neither man nor beast.  

2. The leopard dilfors from the panther and
the ounce in the beauty of its colour, which is of a.
lively yellow, with smaller spots than those of the
panther and ounce, and disposed in groups.

 

THE WHALE.

1. 'I'm:~; whale is the general name of an order
of animals irihzthiting the ocean. It is the largest

animal of which we have any account, and proba~v

my the largest in the World.

2. It is sometimes ninety feet in length in the
northern seas, and in the torrid zone much larger.
The whole furnishes us with oil, whalebone, 65¢.

JUVENILE READER. W65

3. Forinerly, as we are told, he was two hun-
dred and fifty feet long ; but such numbers have
been destroyed, that it is seldom one is now _found,
which is one "hundred feet in length.

4. The head of the whale is about one third of
the whole animal, and yet the eyes are not larger
than those of the ox. His tail is his principal
weapon, with the ‘stroke of which, he can upset a
boat, or dash it in pieces.

‘ 5. Nothing can exceed the affection of the fe-
male for her young, whom she never forsakes
either in danger or distress.

6. There seems to be an analogy between the
whale and the elephant ; for both are the strongest

and largest animals in their respective elernents,

which are never to be dreaded, unless injured or
rovolred.

7. The whale is incomparably fatter than any
other animal, though he subsists chieﬂy on an
insect not larger than a bean, which ﬂoats in
clusters on the ocean. ,

8. The whale-ﬁshery is pursued chieﬂy for the
oil it affords. A young whale, at the time he is
weaned, is said to produce ﬁfty barrels, of oil.

EMPHASIS.

. By emphasis is meant a full and stronger sound of voice,-
by which we distinguish some word or words, on which we de-
s1 11 to lay particular stress, and to show how they affect the rest
ofg the sentence. Sometimes the emphatick words must be dis-
tinguished by a particular tone of voice, as well as by a particular
stress. On the right management of the emphasis depends the
life of pronunciation. If no emphasis be placed on any words,
not only is discourse rendered heavy and lifeless, but the meaning
left often ambiguous. If the emphasis be placed wrong,’ we per-
vert and confound the meaning wholly.

Emphasis may be divided into the supnmovn and the INFERI-
OUR emphasis. The superiour emphasis determines the meaning
of a sentence, with reference to something said before, presup-

oscd by the author as general knowledge, or removes an am-

iwuity, where a passage may have more senses than one. The
in eriour emphasis on orces, graces, and enlivens, but does not
ﬁx, the meaning of any passage. The words to which this lat-
ter emphasis is given, are, in general, such as seem the most im-
portant in the sentence, or, on other accounts, to merit this dis-
tinction. The following passage will serve to exemplify the
superiour emphasis:
“ Of man’s first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world, and all our wo,” dzc.
“ Sing heavenly muse 1”

Supposing that originally other beings, besides men, had dis-
obeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the circum-
stance were well known to us, there would fall an emphasis
utpon the word man’s in the first line; and hence it would‘ read
1. us :

“ Ofman’s ﬁrst disobedience, and the fruit,” die.

But if it wereta notorious truth, that mankind had transgressed
in a peculiar manner more than once, the emphasis would fall on
ﬁrst ,- and the line be read,

“ Of man’sﬁrst disobedience,” ’&»c.

AIR.

1. AIR is the fluid Wl1lCl1 we breathe. Air is
inodorous,i1n'isiblo, insipid, colourless, olasticlc, pos-
sessed of gmvity, easily moved, rareﬁed, and com
doused.

2. The whole mass of fluid, consisting of air,
aqueous and other vapours, surrounding the earth,
is called the atmosphere.

3. Air is necessary to life; being inhaled into
the lungs, it is supposed to furnish the body with
heat and axiiniation. It is the medium of sounds,
and necessary to combustion.

 

STEAM.

1. S*rr:.m is the vapour of water, or the elastick,
aerifonn ﬂuid generated by hooking water to the
boiling point.

:2. When produced. under the common a£mo~
.-spherick promote, its elasticity is equivalent to the

JUVENILE READER. .1711

pressure of the atinosplxere, and it is called low
steam.  

3. But wheii it is heated in a conﬁned state,
its elastic}: force is rapidly ztugmented, and it is
then called high stezun.

4. On the application of cold, steam instantly
returns to the state of water, and thus forms 0.
sudden vacuum.

5. From this property, and from the facility
with which an elaetiek force is generated by

agent at once the most powerful and the most

THE INDIAN AND THE BRITISH
OFFICER.

1. Dcmxo the last American war, a company
of Delaware Indians attacked a small detachment
of the British. troops, and defeated them.

2. As the Indians had greatly the advantage of
awiftoess of foot, and were eager in pursuit, very
few of the fugitives escaped ; and those who fell
into the enomfs hzmds were treated with a cruelty
of which there are not mzmy examples even in the
country.

3. 'I‘wo of the Indians came up with a young
oﬂicer, and attacked him WlI.l1 great fury; as they
were anned with a kind of bztttle-axe, which they
wl a tomahawk, he had no hopes of escape, and
thought only of selling his life as dearly as he
oould; but just at this time another Indian came

up, who seemed to be advanced in years, and was

armed with a bow and arrows.
 The old man instantly drew his bow; but
the: having taken his aim at the oﬁw, howd-

rvvamrrr. READER. 175:

denly dropped the point of his arrow, and interg-
posed between him and his pursuers, who -were
about to out i him in pieces: they retired ' 
respect.

5. The old man then took the ofﬁcer by the
hand, soothedhim into conﬁdence by caresses, and,
having conducted him to his hut, treated.»-him,
with a kindness which did honour to his pro-
fessions.

6. He made him less a slave than a companion,
taught him the; language of t.he_ country, {and in-
structedghim in the rude arts that are practised by
the inhabitants.

7. They lived together in the most cordial amiss

ty; and the young oﬂicer found nothing__t_o' ;regre:t,_,e

but that sometimes the old man ﬁxed:‘f£hi:Sa'gey‘,e_8;
upon him, and, having regarded him for some.

‘minutes, with a steady and silent attention,

into tears.
8. In the mean time the spring returned ;_ and

the Indians having recourse to their arms, again

took the ﬁeld. The old man, who Wasestill,_,vigo_1_'»,
ous, and Well able to bear the fatigues of —war,j;set
out with them, and accompanied by his prisoner.

9. They marched above two hundred leagues,
across the forest, and came at length to a plain
where the British forces were encamped. "The
old man showed his prisoner the tents at adistanc_e,,
at the ‘same time remarking his countenance with

the «most diligent attention.

10. _“ There,” says he, “ are your countrymen;

nation, and take up the hatchet against us Cl”

_ 12. The officer answered, “ I would rather lose
my own life, than take away that of my deliver-

»er.”. l,Th_e Indian then bending down his head,

and covering his face with both his hands, stood
some time silent; then looking earnestly at his
prisoner, he said, in a voice that was at once soft~
erred by tenderness and grief, “ hast thou a fa-

‘more. I saw my son fall in battle; he fought at

my side; I saw him expire! but he died like a.

THE OCCASIONS OF INTEMPERANCE.

1. IT is truly astonishing, my friends, to behold i

pervades thevarious classes of our community.

been rocked upon the ocean, and ripened beneath
an Indian sky, down to those who solace them-
selves with the ﬁery liquor} that has cursed no
other shores than our own ; down, till it reaches
the miserable abode, where the father and mother

will have rum, though the children cry for bread;

5. Down to the bottom, even to the prison-‘house,
the forlorn inmate of which hails him his best
friend, who is cunning‘ enough to convey to him,
undiscovered, the all-consoling, the all-corroding
poison. V

mutual regard, by daily and nightly libations ‘at
some fashionable hotel; it is the custom.

'7. The more advanced take turns in ﬂinging

open their own doors to each other, and the purity
of  esteem is testiﬁed by the number of bot-
tles they ‘canempty together ; it is the custom.

8. The husband deems _it but civil to commemo-
rate the accidental visit of his acquaintance by a
glass of ancient spirit, and the wife holds it a duty
to celebratethe ﬂying call of her companion with
a. taste of the latest liqueur; for this, also, is the
custom. The interesting gossiping of every little

tomary cordial.

THE EFFECTS OF A HUSBANUS IN-.

TEMPERANCE.
[Extractifrom tl1g,,san1e Address]
1. IT is, my friends, in the degradation of a hus-

band by intemperance above all, where she, who
has ventured every thing, feels that every thing

 is lost. VVornan, silent-suffering, devoted Woman,

here bends to her direst aﬂliction.

2. The measure of her W0 is, in truth, full,
whose husband is a drunkard. Who sliall pro-
tect her, when he is her insulter, her oppressor “.1
What shall delight her, when she shrinks from the
sight of his face, and trembles at the sound of his
voice? ,

3. The hearth is indeed dark, that he has made
desolate. There, through the dull midnight hour,
her griefs are whispered to herself; her bruised
heart bleeds in secret.

4. There, while the cruel author of her distress

16*

186 coBB’s

is drowned in distant revelry, she holds her solita-
ry vigil, waiting, yet dreading h_is return, that will
only wringfrom her by his unkindness, tears even
more scalding than those she sheds over his trans-
gression. i -

5. To ﬂing a deeper gloom across the present,
memory turns back, and broods upon the past.
Like the recollection to the sun-stricken pilgrim,
of the cool spring that he drank at in the morning,
the joys of other days come over her, as if only to
mock her parched and weary spirit.

6. She recalls the ardent lover, whose graces

won her from the home of her infancy; the en- ~

raptured father, who bent with such delight over
his new-born children; and she asks, if this can
really be he; this sunken being, who has now
nothing for her but the sot’s disgusting brutality;
nothing for those abashed andtrembling children,
but the sot’s disgusting example 1 i

7. Can we wonder, that amid these agonizing
momeilts, the .tender cords of violated affection
should snap asunder? that the scorned and de-
Serted wife should confess, “there is no killing
like that which kills the heart ?” that though it
‘Would have been hard for her to kiss for the last
time the cold lips of her dead husband, and lay his
body for ever in the dust, it is harder to behold him

a so debasing life, that even his death would be
greeted in mercy?

8. Had he died in the light of his goodness, be-
queathing to his family the inheritance of an un-
tarnished name, the example of virtues that should

JUVENILE READER. 187

blossom for his sons and daughters from the tomb;
though she would have wept bitterly indeed, the
tears of grief would not have been also the tears
of shame. >

9. But to behold him, fallen away from the
station he once adorned, degraded from eminence
to ignominy; at home, turning his dwelling to
darkness, and its holy e‘ndearments to mockery;
abroad, thrust from the companionship of the

worthy, a self-branded outlaw ; this is the we that

the wife feels is more dreadful than death; that
she mourns‘ over as worse than widowhood.

THE EFFECTS OF INTEMPERANCE
UPON A REPUBLICK.

[Extract from the same Address.)

1. IN a national point of view, my friends, the
subject of intemperance assumes a fearful political
importance. The ruinous consequences of wide
spread intemperance to a people governing them-
selves, can hardly be overrated.

2. If there be on earth one nation more than
another, whose institutions must draw their life-.-
blood from the individual purity of its citizens, that
nation is our own. _

3. Rulers by divine right, and nobles by heredi-
tary succession, may, perhaps, tolerate with impu-
nity those depraving indulgences which keep‘ the
great mass abject.

188 centre

4. Where the many enjoy little or no power,
it were a trick of policy to wink at those enema-
ting vices, which would rob them of both the abili-
ty and the inclination to enjoy it.

5. But in our country, where ztltiioet every man,
however humble, bears to the omnipotent ballot-
box his full portion of the sovereignt) ; where at
regular periods the ministers of authority, who
went forth to rule, return to be ruled, and la
down their dignities at the feet of the monarch
multitude; where, in short, publick sentiment is
the absolute lever that moves the political world,
the purity of the people is the rock of political
safety. ‘ ‘

6. We may boast, if we please, of our exal‘ed
privil es, and fondly imagine that they will be
etern ; but whenever those vices shall abound,
which undeniably tend to debasement, steeping
the poor and the ignorant still lower in poverty and
ignorance, end thereby destroying that wholesome
mental equality, which can alone sustain rt eelti
mlal people, it will be found by woful experience,
that our happy system of government, the best
ever devised for the intelligent and good, is the
very worst to be intrtrsted to the degraded and
vicious.

7'. The great majority will then truly become a
many-headed monster, to be tamed and led at will.

8. The tremendous power of suﬂrage, like the
nrength of the eyelets Naznrite, so far from being
their rotection, will but serve to pull down upon
their code the temple their ancestors retired for

Jvvnxzxitz RE.tDl3It. 189

them. Caballers and dem.:tgog'ues will find it an
easy task to delude those who lmve deluded them-
selves; and the {modern of the people will ﬁnally
be buried in the grave of their virtues.

9. National greatness may survive; s lendid
talents and brilliant victories may ﬂing their delu-
sive lustre abroad ; these can illumine the darkness
that lmngs round the throne of a despot; but their
light will be like the baleful ﬂame that hovers over
decaying mormlity, and tells of the corruption that
{esters beneath.

10. The immortad spirit will have gone; and
along our shores, mid among our hills, those shores
made sacred by the sepulchre of the pilgrim, those
hills hallowed by the uncofiined bones of the pa-
triot; even there, in the ears of their degenerate
descendants, shall ring the last knell of departed
liberty.

“ In this species of composition, plausibility is much more es-
sential than probability.” In these examples, the emphasis re-
quires the accent to be placed on syllables, to which it does not
commonly belong.

In order to acquire a proper management of the emphasis,
the great rule to be given, is, that the reader study to attain a
jjust conception of the force and spirit of the sentiments which

e is to pronounce. For to lay the emphasis with exact ro-

riety, is a constant exercise of ood sense and attention. t is
at from being an inconsiderab e attainment. It is one of the
most decisive trials of a true and just taste; and must arise
from feelin delicately ourselves, and from judging accurately
of what is . ttest to strike the feelings of others. '

There is one errour, against which it is particularly proper to
caution the learner, namely; that of multiplying emphatical
words too much, and using the emphasis indiscriminately. It
is only by a. prudent res_erve and distinction in the use of them,
that we can give them any Weight. If they recur too often ; if
a reader attempts to render every thing he expresses of high
importance, by amultitude of strong emphases, we soon learn
to pay little regard to them. To crowd every sen.tence- with
emphatical words, is like crowding all the pages of a book with
Italick characters, which, as to the effect, is just the same as to
use no such distinctions at all.

TONES.

Terms are different both from emphasis and pauses; con-
sisting in the notes or variations of sound which we employ in
the expression of our sentiments. Emphasis affects particular
words and phrases, with a degree of tone or inﬂection of voice ;
but tones, peculiarly so called, affect sentences, paragraphs, and
sometimes even the whole of a discourse. ,

To show the use and necessity of tones, we need only ob-
serve, that the 1nind,»in communicating its ideas, is in a constant
state of activity, emotion, or agitation, from the different effects
which thoseideas produce in the speaker.

The limits of this introduction do not admit of examples to
illustrate the variety of tones belonging to the different. as-
sions and emotions.’ VVe shall, however, select one, whic is
extracted from the beautiful lamentation of David over Saul and
Jonathan, and which will, in some degree, clucidatevvhat has
been said on this subject. “ The beauty of Israel is slain upon

4. Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper
use of those means which the God of nature has
placed in our power. Three millions of people,
armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a
country as that which we possess,are invincible by
any force which our enemy can send against us.

5. Besides, sir, we shall not fight“ our battles
alone. There is a just God who presides over the
destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends
to ﬁght our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not
to the strong alone ; it is to the vigilant, the active,
the brave. ,

6. Besides, sir, we have no election. , We
were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to
retire from the contest. There is no retreat, but
in submission and slavery ! Our chains are forged!
Their clanking may be , heard on the plains of
Boston‘! The war is inevitable ; and let it come!

I repeat it, sir, let it come!

7.:It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.
Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace; but there is
no peace. The war is actually begun! The

to our ears the clash of roaountling arms !

8. Our brethren are ztlrcmly in the ﬁeld! Why
stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen
wish? W'hat woultl they ltzwe? Ia life so clear,
or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price

1. Tm-2 war of the revolutitm closed in 1783,
and General Waslltington immediately repaired to
congress, tlmn in session at Annapolis, ta resign
his cmnmission. That august body gave him
publicl: tmdicmze on the day succeeding that of his
arrival, at 12 o’clocl<.

2. He was introdtrccrl by the secretary, and
corrducted to at clmir. Soon after, the president
arose, and lIlfO|.‘l1'lf‘,'(ll'lil1)., that the United Sta1es,in
congress assembled, were prepared to receive his
mmmumcation.

3. General W'aslrington then rose, and delivered
the following address :

4. “ Mn. Pru:srm::\"r,-—-Tlre great events on

taken place, I have now the honour of offering my
sincere comgratukttions to congress, and of present-

hands the trust committed to me, and to claim the
indulgence of retiring from the service of my

5. “ Happy in the conﬁrmation of our independ-
ence and several ty, and pleased with the oppor-
tunity afforded t e United States of becoming a
respectable nation, I resign, with satisfaction, the
appointment I accepted with difﬁclence; a dim-
dence in my ability to accomplish a task so ardtt~
ous, which, however, was superseded by a con-
ﬁdence in the rectitude of our cause, the support
of the supreme power of the Union, and the
bleaing of Heaven.

6. S‘ The successful termination of the war, has
veriﬁed the most sanguine expectations; and my
gratitude for the interposition of Providence, and
the assistance I have received from my country»
men, increases with every review of the momentous
contest.

in general, I shot: d do injustice to my own feel-

ON THE DEATH OF WASHINGTON.

[An extract from Major General Lee’s Funeral Oration, deliver-
ed before both Houses, at the request of _Congress, Decem-
ber 26, 1799.]

1. IN obedience to your Will,  rise your humble
organ; with the hope of executing a part of the
system of publick mourning, which you have been
pleased to adopt commemorative‘ of the death of
the most illustrious and most beloved personage
this country has ever produced; and Which, While

it transmits to posterity your sense of the awful"

event, faintly represents your knowledge of the

consummate excellence you so cordially honour.
2. Desperate indeed is any attempt on earth to

meet correspondently this dispensation of heaven;

for, while with pious resignation we submit to the

will of an all gracious Providence, we can never

cease lamenting in our ﬁnite View of Omnipotent

17'

194 eoBi3’s

wisdom, the heart—rending privation for which our
nation weeps.

3. When the civilized world shakes to the centre;
when every moment gives birth to strange and
momentous changes; when our peaceful quarter
of the globe, exempt as it happily has been from
any share in the slaughter of the human race,
may yet be compelled to abandon her paciﬁck
policy, and to risk the doleful casualties of war:
what limit is there to the extent of our loss?
None within the reach of my words to express;
none which your feelings will not disavow.

_ 4. The founder of our federal republick 3, our
bulwark in war, our guide in peace, is no more!
0 that this were but questionable! Hope, the
comforter of the wretched, would pour into our
agonizing hearts its balmy dew. But, alas ! there
is no hope for us !

5. Our VVASHINGTON is removed for ever ! Pos-
sessing the stoutest frame, and purest mind, he
had passed nearly to the age of sixty-eight years,
in the enjoyment of high health, when, habituated
by his care of us to neglect himself, a slight cold,
disregarded, became inconvenient on Friday, op-
pressive on Saturday, and, defying every medical
interposition, before the morning of Sunday, put
an end to the best of men !

6. An end, did I say? His fame survives!
bounded, only by the limits of the earth, and by
the extent of the human mind. lHe survives in
our ‘hearts, in the growing knowledge of our chil-

JUVENILE READER. 195

dren, in the affection of the good throughout the
world:  

7. And when our monuments shall be done
away; when nations now existing shall be no
more; when even our young and far spreading
empire shall have perished, still will our WAsH~
ING1-‘oN’s glory unfaded shine, and die not, until
love of virtue cease on earth, or earth itself sink
into chaos.

8. How, my fellouucitizens, shall I single out
to your grateful hearts his pre-erninent worth?
Where shall I begin in opening to your View a.
character throughout sublime? Shall I speakof
his warlike achievements, all springing from.obe~
dience to his country’s will; all directed to his
country’s good ?

9. Moving in his own orbit, he imparted heat
and light to his most distant satellites ; and com-
bining the physical and moral force of all within
his sphere, with irresistible weight he took his
course, comrniserating folly, (lisdaining vice, dis—
maying treason, and invigorating despondency;
until the auspicious hour arrived, when he brought
to submission the since conqueror of India; thus

’ ﬁnishing his long career of military glory, with a

lustre corresponding to his great name, and in
this his last act of war, aﬁixing the seal of fate to
our nation’s birth.

10. To the horrid din of battle, sweet peace
succeeded; and our virtuous Chief, mindful only
of the common good, in a moment tempting per-
sonal aggrandizernent, hushed the discontents of

196 coBB’s

growing sedition; and, surrendering his power
into the hands from which he had received it, com
verted his sword into a ploughshare, teaching an
admiring world, that to be truly great, you must
be truly good.

11. Was I to stop here, the picture would be
incomplete, and the task imposed, unﬁnished.
Great as was our WASHINGTON in war, and as
much as did that greatness contribute to produce
the American Republick, it is not in war alone his
pre-eminence stands conspicuous. _

12. His various talents, combining all the capa-
cities of a statesman with those of a soldier, ﬁtted
him alike to guide the councils, and the armies of
our nation.

13. Scare-ely had he rested from his martial
toils, while his invaluable parental advice was still
sounding in our ears, when he who had been our
sword and our shield, was called forth to act a less
splendid, but more important part.

14. Possessing a clear and penetrating mind, a
sound and strong judgement, calmness and temper
for deliberation, with invincible ﬁrmness and per-
severance in‘ resolutions maturely formed, drawing
information from .all, acting from himself, with
incorruptible integrity and unvarying patriotism;
his own superiority, and the publick conﬁdence
alike marked him as the man designed by heaven
to lead in the political as well as military events
which have distinguished the era of his life.

15. The ﬁnger of an overruling Providence,
pointing at WAsH1NGToN, was neither mistaken

JUVENILE READER. 197

nor unobserved ; yvhen, to realize the vast hopes to
which our revolution had given birth, a change of
political system became indispensable.

16. How novel, how grand the spectacle ! Inde-
pendent States stretched over an immense territory,
and known only by common diﬂiculty, clinging
to their union as the rock of their safety, de-
ciding by frank comparison of their relative con-
dition, to rear on that rock, under the guidance
of reason, a common government, through whose
commanding protection, liberty and order, with
their long train of blessings, should be safe to
themselves, and the sure inheritance of their pos-
terity.

17. This arduous task devolved "on citizens se-
lected by the people, from knowledge of their Wis-
dom, and conﬁdence in their virtue. In this
august assembly of sages and patriots, W'AsHING-
TON, of course, was found; and, as if acknowl-
edged to be the most wise,.where all were Wise,
with one Voice, he was declared their Chief.

18. How well he merited this rare distiriction-~
how faithful were the labours of himself and his-
compatriots—-—the work of their hands, and our
union, strength, and prosperity, the fruits‘ of that
Work, best attest.

 But, to have essentially aided in presenting
to h,'s country this consummation of herihopes,
neither satisﬁed the claims of his fellow-citizens
on histalents, nor those duties which the posses-
sion of those talents imposed.

20. Heaven had not infused into his mind such

17 *

an uncommon share of its ethereal spirit to remain
unemployed, or lyestowed on him his genius, un-
accompanied with the corresponding duty of de-
voting it to the common gocxl. To luwe framed
a. constituttiun, xme showing only, without reali~
Zing, the getleral l1t1;)piI1ees.

A111en*it:.#1, etemlfzust in her preference, with one
voice sunmmoued lter belcwed WAss1»nz~:m‘oz~z, un-
przuztieetl as he was in the duties of civil adm.inis~
tmtion, to execute this last act in the completion of
the national felicity.

'22. Ol")£‘(ll€1ll. to her call, he asstlnled the high
ofﬁce with that sclf~tlisu*ust peculiar to his innate
mtxleety, the conetaxtt attendant of pre-eminent
virtue.

23. What xvas the burst of joy, through our
anxious land, on tliis exl1ila.rateing"e\‘ent, is known
to 113 all. The ( f*t%‘d, the yeung, the hrave, the
fair, rivalled each other in demm1strations of grati~
tude; and this high wrought, delightful scene,
was lteightened in its etlect, by the singular eon-
test lyetween the zeal of the bestowcrs and the
avoidance of the receiver of the honours bestowed.

between virtue and  between duty and
advantage, between the genuine maxims dun

honest and magnnnimous policy, and the solid re-
wards of publick prosperity and individual felicity.

26. Watching wit 1 equal and comprehensive
eye over this great znisexriblagc of communities and
interests, he laid the foundations of our national
policy in the unerring, immutable principles of mo-
rality,  on religion, exemplifying the pre-emi-
nence of it free governrnent, hy all the attributes
which win the allizctions of its citizens, or corn»

THE TRUE POLICY OF AMERICA.

{An extract from De VVitt Clintorvs Speech, delivered in the
Senate of the United States, February ‘23, 1803.]

1. IF I were called upon, Mr. Chairman, to me»
scribe a c/nurse of policy rnoet important for this
country to pursue, it would be to avoid European
connexions and wars.

2. The time must arrive when we will have to
contend with some of the great. powers of Europe,
but let that. period he put oil‘ as long as pmeihle.
It is our interest and our duty to cultivate peace,
with sincerity and good faith.

3. As a young nation, pursuing industry in
every channel, and adventuring commerce in
every sea, it is highly important that we should
not only have a paciﬁck character,’ but that we
should really deserve it.

cumcised triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no
dew or rain upon you, or ﬁelds of offerin s; for there the
shield of the mighty was vilely cast away; t e shield of Saul,
as though he had not been anointed with oil.-” The first of
these divisions expresses sorrow and lamentation: therefore the
note is low. The next contains a spirited command, and should
be renounced much higher. The other sentence, in which he
ma es a pathetick address to the mountains where his friends
had been slain, must be expressed in a note quite different from
the former two; not so low as the ﬁrst, or so high as the sec-
ond, in a manly, ﬁrm, and yet plaintive tone. _

But when we recommend to readers an attention to the tone
and lan uage of emotions, we must be understood to do it with
roper limitation. Moderation is necessary in this point, as it
is in other things. For when reading becomes strictly imita-
tive, it assumes atheatrical manner, and must be highly improp-
er, ‘as well as give offence to the hearers; because it is incon-
sistent with that delicacy and modesty which areindispensable
on suchoccasions. The speaker who delivers his own emotions
must be supposed to be more vivid and animated, than would be
pro‘p;3r'in the person who relates them at second -hand.

' i e shall conclude with the following rule, for thetones that
indicate the passions and emotions. “In reading, ‘let all your
tones of expression be borrowed from those of common speech,
but, in some degree, more faintly characterized. Let those tones

which signify any disagreeable passion of the mind, he still more.

faint than those which indicate agreeable emotions ;‘ and, on all
occasions, preserve yourselves from bein’ so far affected with the
subject, as to be able to proceed throug it, with that easy and
masterly manner, which has its good effects in this, as well as
in every other art.”

PAUSES OR. STOPS.

Pauses or rests, in speaking or reading, are ‘a totalcessation
of the voice, during a erceptible, and, in many cases, a measu-
rable space of time- auses are equally necessary to the speaker
and the hearer. To the speaker, that he may take breath, with-
out which he can not proceed far in delivery; and that he may,
by these temporary rests, relieve the organs of speech, which
otherwisewould be soon tired by continued action : to the hearer,
that‘ the ear also may be relieved from. the fatigue, which it
would otherwise endure -from a continuityof‘ sound ; and that

4. If We manifest an unwarrantable ambition,
and a rage for conquest, we unite all the great
powers of Europe against us. The security of all
the,European possessions in our vicinity, will eter-
nally depend, not upon their strength, but upon
our moderation and justice.

5. Look at the Canadas; at the Spanish terri-
tories to the south; at the British, Spanish, French,
Danish, and Dutch West India islands, at the vast
countries to the west, as far as where the Paciﬁck
rolls its waves.

7 6. Consider well the eventful consequences that

would result, if we were possessed by a spirit of _

conquest. Consider well the impression, which a
manifestation of that spirit will make upon those
who would be affected by it.  

7'. If we are to rush at once into the territory of
a neighbouring nation, with ﬁre and sword, for
the misconduct of a subordinate oﬁicer, will not
our national character be greatly injured ".3

8. Will we not be classed with the robbers and
destroyers of mankind? Will not the nations of
Europe perceive in this conduct the germe of a
lofty spirit, and an enterprising ambition, which
will level them to the earth, when age has matured
our strength, and expanded our powers of annoy-
ance, unless they combine to cripple us in our in-
fancy ?

9. May not the consequences be, that we must
look out for a naval force to protect our commerce,

that a close alliance will result, that we will be

thrown at once into the ocean of European poli-

ticks, Where every Wave that rolls, and every Wind
that blows, will agitate our bark?

10. Is this a desirable state of things ‘I Will the
people of this country be seduced into it by all the
oolourings of rhetorick, and all the arts of sophis-
try; by vehement appeals to their pride, and artful
addresses to their cupidity ‘.1 t

11. No, sir. Three fourths of ‘the American
people, I assert it boldly and without fear of con-
tradiction, are opposed to this measure. ’ g

12. And would you take up arms with a’ mill-
stone hanging round‘ your neck? How would
you bear up, not only against the force of the ene-
my, but against the irresistible current of pub1ick'
opinion? The thing, sir, is impossible;   the
measure is worse than madness; it is wicked, be-
yond the powers of description.

 

ADDRESS TO THE SURVIVING SOL-
DIERS OF THE REVOLUTION.

[An extract from Daniel Webster’s Address, delivered at the
laying of the corner stone of the Bunker Hill Monument,
June 17th, 1825.]

1. VENERABLE MEN! you have come down to
us, from a former generation.  Heaven has boun-
teously lengthened out your lives, that you might
behold this joyous day.

2. You are now upon the heights of? Bunker,
where you stood, ﬁfty years ago, this“ very hour;

202 coBB’s

with your brothers, and your neighbours, shoulder
to shoulder, in the strife for your country.

3. Behold, how altered! The same heavens
are indeed over your heads; the same ocean rolls
at your feet; but all else, how changed! You
hear now no roar of hostile cannon; you see no

mixed volumes of smoke and ﬂame, rising from}

burning Charlestown.

4. The ground strewed with the dead and the
dying ; the impetuous charge ; the steady and
successful repulse; the loud call to repeated as-
sault ; thesummoning of all that is manly to re.-
peated resistance; a thousand bosoms freely and
fearlessly bared, in an instant, to whatever of ter-
rour there may be in war and death ; all these you
have witnessed, but you witness them no more.

5. All is peace. The heights of yonder Ine-

tropolis, its towers and roofs, which you then saw,

ﬁlled with wives and children and countrymen, in
distress and terrour, and looking, with unutterable
emotions, for the issue of the combat, have pre-
sented you, today, with the sight of its whole
happy population, come out to welcome and greet
you with a universal jubilee. «

6. Yonder proud ships, by a felicity of position,
appropriately lying at the foot of this mount, and
seeming fondly to cling around it, are not means
of annoyance to you, but your country’s own
,«means of distinction and defence.

7'. All is peace; and God has grantedyou this
sight of your country’s happiness, ere you slumber
in the grave for ever.

the reward of’ your patriotick toils; and he has al-

THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.

1. THE press is one of the ‘most useful discov-
eries for the general diffusion of knowledge in the
‘world, that has ever been made.

2. Periodical publications may be very useful to
society, by enlightening the minds of the citizens,
instructing them in the affairs of common life, the
stéite of their country, and the common good.

3. This country has long enjoyed the beneﬁts
resulting from such publications. Such, in gener-
al, has been the usefulness of the freedom of the
press, that we have had great occasion to exalt in
the privilege.

4. VVell regulated newspapers and niagazines,
are of inestimable value. In them we mayiiﬁnd
instruction for the artisan, the mechanick, the
husbandman, the divine, and the statesman.  
i 5. Here the scholar and sentimentalist may ﬁnd
both improvement and entertainment. Here,too,
every individual may trace men and manners";
may read thecllaracters of those in office, discover
by what methods they came there, and what are
the ruling motives that govern their‘actionS.‘

Where robins shall. sing of my love,
And sparrows my visits shall greet.

the understanding may have suﬂicient time to mark the distinc-
tion of sentences, and their several members. ,

There 2 re twokinds of pauses ; first, emphatical pauses, and
next, such as marl; the distinctionof the sense. An emphati-
cal pause is made, after something has been said of great im-
portance, and on which the speaker desires to ﬁx the hearer’s at-
tention. Such pauses have the same effect as a strong empha-
sis, and are subject to the same rules, especially that of not

-using them too frequently,

But the most frequent and the principal use of pauses, his to
mark the divisions of the sense, and at the same time to allow
the reader to draw his breath; and the proper and delicate ad-«
justment of such pauses is one of the most nice and difficult a‘r~
ticles of delivery. In all reading, the_manage_ment of the breath
requires a great deal of care, so as not to oblige us to divide
words from each other, which have so intimate .a connexion,
that they ought to be pronounced with the same. breath, and
without the least separation. ‘ ‘

Pauses in reading and publick speaking, must be governed by
the same manner in which we utter ourselves in or inary, sen-
sible conversation, and not upon the stiff, artiﬁcial manner,
which we acquire from reading books accordincr to the common
punctuation. The points in printing are far iiom markin all
the auses which ought to be used in speaking. A forum at-
tention to those resting places, has been the cause of a tedious
monotony, by leading the reader to a similar tone at every, step,
and.a uniform cadence at every period.

To render pauses pleasing and expressive, they must not only
be used in the right place, but also accompanied with a proper
tone of voice, by which the nature of these pauses is intima-

ted. , Sometimes it is only a slight and simple suspension of ‘

voice that is proper ; sometimes a dc rec of cadence in the voice
is required; and sometimes that peculiar tone and cadence, which
denote the sentence to be ﬁnished. In all these cases, We are
to regulate ourselves, by attending to the same manner, in_which
nature teaches us to ‘speak, when engaged in real and earnest
discourse with others. i .4, \

It is a general rule, that the suspending pause should be used
when the sense is incomplete; and the closing one, when it is
ﬁnished. But there are phrases, in which, although the sense
is not completed, the voice takes the closing, rather than the
suspending pause ;.and others, in which the sentence ﬁnished
by the pause-‘of suspension.

letters, and only the long and short sounds of the vowels. ‘

Cobb’s SPELLING-BOOK, containing the Ru-

diments of the English Language, arranged in catechetical order ;‘an'

than are generally inserted in Spelling-Books; many useful tables: and
the pro er names in the New‘Testament. Designed to teach the or-

“ This S ellin -Book has peculiar claims to attention. Mr. Cobb might,
we think, have one a signal service to education by publishing a cor’-‘
rected abridgment of Walker’s Dictionary, or a vocabulary of disputed
or doubtful words. He has evidently bestowed much attention on such
subjects ; and even his Spelling-Book wears a formidable air of authority
from the labour and research by which it is characterized. The lessons
are uncommonly full and accurate. The whole work, ‘indeed, is highly
creditable to the author’s intelligence and‘industry.”—Amerz’can Journal
qf Education. T

“The author has certainly evinced great industry and research, and
has shown himself well acquainted with the department in which he has
so diligently laboured.”—-New York Times.

“ Cobb’s Spelling-Book is, we are confident, by far the most correct one
at present to be found.”--—Clea1:ela7td (Ohio) Herald.

“ The plan and general arrangement of the book are probably the best.
which, in a mere Spelling-Book, can be adopted. It contains a greater
number of words, and those more agcurately classedin the several tables,
than we have noticed in any other SfJe‘l1ing‘~Book.”-— Geneva Gazette.

“The whole arrangement of the lessons is more simpliﬁed, and better

adapted to the capacity of the child, than that of the books in general
use.”- -Cats/sill Recorder.

“ Its correctness of spelling and ronunciation, the excellent arrange’-.

“ Cobb‘s Juvenile Reader, No. l, is the first number of a series of small
books, designed to aid children in their first essays at reading-, by L. Cobb,
author of a Spelling-Book, and other works for instruction. The‘ aim of
the author a pears to be, to lead the young reader by easy and regular
gradations, rom simple to complex sentences, graduating at every stage,
the subject, matter, and the style, to the advancement of the pupil’s' under-
standing. The importance of such a course of reading, to most children,
must be obvious. A very common errour, in all books of this class, which

have fallen under our inspection, is, that polysyllables are copiously in-'

ti-oduced, into even the earliest reading‘ lessons, andthe langua e is too
elevated for juvenile comprehension. he natural effect is, that ereadi
ing of the child is purely mechanical ; he learns to read words‘ without
connecting ideas with them, and the consequence to the child can not be
misconceived.

“The author of the Juvenile Reader seems to have avoided these er-
rours, while he has given to the child a neat and interesting little volume,
from which he can not fail to derive irn ortant lessons in 1'no'ra‘1it'y.? One

xxii INTRODUCTION.

Nothing is more destructive" to energy and propriety than the
habit of confounding the closing pause, with that fall of the
voice, or cadence, with which many readers uniformly ﬁnish a
sentence. The tones and inflections of t-he voice, at the close of
a sentence, should be varied according to the general nature of
the’disco'urse, and the particular construction and meaning of
the sentence. In plain narrative and argumentation, attention
to the manner in which we relate a fact, or maintain an argu-
ment, in conversation, will show, that it is frequently more
proper to raise the voice than to ﬁrll it, at the. end of a sentence.

In pathetick pieces, especially those of the plaintive, tender,
or solemn kind, the tone of the passion will often require a still
greater cadence of the voice. The best method of correcting a
uniform cadence, is frequentl ’ to read select sentences, in which
antitheses are introduced, an argumentative pieces, or such as
abound with interrogatives, or earnest exclamations.

MANNER OZ-‘ READING VERSE.

,When we are reading verse, there is a peculiar diﬁiculty in
making‘ the pauses justly. The diﬁiculty arises from the melody
of verse, which dictates to the ear pauses or rests‘ of its own : and
to adjust and compound these properly with the pauses of the
sense, so as neither to hurt the ear, nor offend the understanding,
is so very nice a matter, that it is no Wonder we so seldom meet
with good readers _of poetry. There are two kinds of auses
that belong to the melody of verse: one is, the pause at t e end
of the line ; and the other, the caesural pause in or near the mid-
dle ofit. With regard to the ause at the end_ of the line, which
marks that strain or verse to e ﬁnished, rhyme renders this al-
ways sensible, and in some measure compels us to observe it in
our pronunciation. In respect to blank verse, we ought also to
read it so as to make every ‘Pine sensible to the ear: for, what is
the use of melody, or for what end has the poet composed in verse,
if, in reading his lines, We suppress his numbers, by omitting the
ﬁnal pause, and degrade them, by our pronunciation, "ito mere
prose ‘I At the same time that we attend to this pause, every ap-
Iiearance of sin -song and tone must be carefully juarded against,

he close of t e line where it makes no pause in the meaning,
ought not to be marked by such a tone. as is used in ﬁnishing a
sentence; but, without either fall or elevation of the voice, it
should be denoted only by so slight a suspension of sound, as
may distinguish the passage from one line to another, without
injuring the meaning. ‘

‘rm: srors on POINTS, AND ornrzn crmmcrsas usian IN
WRITING AND PRINTING.

The use of punctuation is designed, ﬁrst, to assist the reader

to discern the grammatical construction, and next, to regulate his
ronunciation. The several stops as the are used in writrn
_ . ,. 7

and printing, shall be mentioned, with particular reference,

however, to thepreceding observations on the pauses or stops.

A comma[ ,  denoting, especially in long sentences, a little
elevation of the voice, is the shortest pause, at which the reader’s
voice should stop the time of pronouncing one syllable.

A semicolon ;P denoting, for the most part, an evenness of
the voice, at Whic 1 the reader’s voice should stop the time of
pronouncing two syllables. '

A colon [ :] marks a little depression of the voice, at which
the reader’s voice should stop the tune of pronouncing four syl-
lables. ' ' '

A period  ] is a- full stop, denoting a greater depression of
the voice, than the colon, at which the rea er’s voice should stop

‘the time of pronouncing six syllables.

A note of interrogation  C?] shows that a question is asked,
and the end of the sentence preceding it should be read with a
raised or elevated tone of . voice, except when a question is asked,
by who, which, what, how, why, when, where, wherefore, which
sentences should be read with a depression of the voice at the
en_d of them.

A note of exclamation  is a mark of wonder, surprise, or
admiration. , The reader’s voice should stop as long at a note of
exclamation and interrogation, as at a colon.

- A hyphen [-] is used in connecting compound words; and,
it is used when a word is divided, and the former part of the
word is written at the end of one line, and the latter art of it

-at the beginning of ‘another. In thiscase, it should ways be

placed at the en of the ﬁrst line. . .. _

The best and easiest rule for dividing the syllables in spelling,
is to divide them as they are naturally divided in a right pro-
nunciation. ' ‘

A parenthesis  )]' includes something explanatory, which,
if omitted, would not obscure the sense. The words included.‘
in a parenthesis, should be read with a weaker tone of voice than
the rest of the sentence. ’

An apostrophe ["] is used to show the possessive case, as, a

xxiv I.\"rrmnccrio:c.

iman’s property. It is likewise used to show that some letter or

letters are omitted, as, lov’d for loved, ’tis for it is, &c.

An asterisk [* ], obelisk ["'r ], parallels [ H ], and many other i

marks, are used to direct the reader to some note or remark in
the margin or at the bottom of a-page.

A‘caret[ A  is used to show that some letter or word has been
omitted through mistake. In this case, the letter or word should

. ' D

be‘ inserted above the line, -and the caret under it; thus, maner;
161' 

I loved her for modesty and virtue.
A

A quotation [ “ ”] is two inverted commas, placed at the be-
ginning of ‘a passage, which is uoted from some other author,
and two apostrophes, placed at t e conclusion of it; as, “The
proper study of mankind is man.”

A section [§] is used to divide a discourse or chapter into
less parts. .

An, index or hand [age] points out a remarkable passage, or

‘something that requires particular attention.

_A paragraph [ ‘ll ] denotes the beginning of a new subject.

The «crotchets [ ] include a word or sentenc which is intend-
ed to exemplify the foregoing sentence ; or wh'ch is intended to
supply some deficiency, or rectify some mistake.

An ellipsis [-—-] isuscd when some letters in a word are
omitted; as, la-—g for king: it is also used to denote an uncer-
tain pause only; then it is called a dash.

, A brace[ ] is used to. connect several lines or words to-
gether.

A diaeresis [ --] is put over the latter of two vowels, to show
that they belong to two distinct syllables ; thus, Creator.

We shall close these rules and observations, _by a remark of
considerable importance to young persons who are desirous of
learning to read well. Few rules on the subject are intelligible
to children, unless illustrated by the voice of as competent ins-
structer. They should, therefore, pay great attention to the
manner in which their teacher, and other persons of approved
skill, perform the business of reading. ‘They should observe
their mode of pronouncing the words, placing the emphasis,

‘making the pauses, managing the voice, and adapting it to the

various sub°eets they read; and, in all these respects, endeavour
to imitate mm as nearly as possible.

THE TWINS.

1., .DURING the period of the war of the revolu-
tion, there resided, in the western part of Massa-
chusetts, a farmer, by the name of Stedrnan. He
was a man of substance, descended from a very
respectable English family, well educated, distin-
guished for great ﬁrmness of character in general,
and alike remarkable for ‘ inﬂexible integrity and
steadfast loyalty to his king. «

2. Such was the reputation he sustained, that,
even when the most violent antipathies against
royalism swayed the community, it was still ad-
mitted on all hands, that farmer Stedrnan, though
a tory, was honest in his opinions, and ﬁrmly be-

lieved them to be right.

3. The period came when Burgoyne was ad
vancing, from the north. It was a time of great
anxiety with both the friends and foes of the revo-
lution, and one which called forth. their highest
exertions. The patriotick militia ﬂocked to the
standard of Gates and Stark, while many of the
tories resorted to the quarters. of Burgoyne and
Baum. ‘ Among the latter was Stedman.

4-. He had no soonerdecided it to be his duty,
than he took a kind farewell of his wife, a woman
of. uncommon beauty, gave his children, a twin
boy and girl, a long embrace, then mounted his
horse, and departed. He joined himself to the
unfortunate expedition of Baum, and wastaken,

with other prisoners of war, by the victorious
Stark.

5. He made no attempt to conceal his name or
character, which were both soon discovered, and
he was accordingly committed to prison as a traitor.
The jail, in which he was conﬁned, was in the
western part- of Massachusetts, and nearly in ; a
ruinous condition. y

6. The farmer was one night awaked from his
sleep, by several persons in his room. “Come,”
said they, ,“you can now regain your liberty: we
have made a breach in the prison, through which

you can escape.”

7’. To their astonishment, Stedman utterly re-
fused‘ to leave his prison. In vain they eXpostu-
lated with him ; in vain they represented to him
that his life was atstake.

8. His answer was, that he was a true man,
and a subject of KingGeorge; and he would not
creep out of a h.ole at night, and sneak away from
the rebels, to save his neck from the gallows.
Finding it altogether fruitless to attempt to move
him, his friends left him, with some expressions of
spleen. .

9. The time at length arrived for the trial‘ of
the prisoner. . The distance to the place where the
court was sitting was about sixtymiles. Stedman
remarked" to the sheriff, when he came to attend
him,- that it" would save some expense and incon-
venience, if he could be permitted to go alone, and
on foot. y

10. “ Andi suppose,” said the sheriff, “ that you
should prefer your safety to your honour, and
leave me to seek you in the British eamp ‘P’ “ I

had thought,” said the fummr, reddening with in
diglnation, “ that I was speaking to one who knew
me.”

11. “I do know you, im:leed," said the sheriff ;
“I spoke but in jest; you shall have your way.
Go, and on the third day I slmll expect to see you
at S---—.” The further departed, anti, at the ap-
pointed time, he placed himself in the hands of

12. I was now engaged as his cotms-rel. Sted~
man insisted, before the court, upon telling his
whole story ; and, when I wuuld have taken ad-
vantage of S0m8 teclmiml paints, he sharply re-
buked me. and told me: that he has! not employed
the to pI‘e\‘£tt‘tt.‘.t1t£‘, but only to assist him in telling
the truth. i

13. I had never seen such a display of simple
integrity. It was affecting to witness his love. of
holy, unmrnislxed truth, elevating him abave every
other cousideratiun, and presiding in his breast as a
sentiment even superiuur to the love of life.

15. Stedmau was condemned. I told him than
was 8 chance of pardon, if he wculd ask for it. I
drew up at petitien, and requmtw him to sign it;
but he refused.

17’. “ No 3 ask me not to sign that petition. If

quires the blood of an honest man, for a conscien-
tious discharge of what he deemed his duty, let
me be its victiin.

18. “ Go to in}; judges, and tell them, that I

was in vain that I pressed the subject; and I went

19. This led him frequently to take excursions
into the country, for the purpose of sketching such

think, striking portraits of the wife and children of

to? for to counterfeit and tlissemble, is to put on
the appearance of some real excellence.

2. Now, the best wzty in the world for ti. man to

5. Tlterefure, if any men think it convenient
to seem good} let him be so indeed, and then his
goodness will appear to every body’s satisfacﬁon ;
so that upon all amounts sincerity is true wisdom.

6. Particularly as to the affairs of this world, in-
tegrity has many advantages over all thepﬁne and
artificial wztye of diesitnulation and deceit; it it
much the plainer and easier, much the safer and
more secure way of dealing in the world.

7. It has less of trouble and ditﬁculty, of en-
tanglement and perplexity, of danger and

carryingus thither in a straight line, and will b '

will then serve his turn, neither truth no: false-

16. And I have often thought that God has,
in his great wisdoxii, hid from men of false and dis-
honest minds, the wonderful advantagw of truth
and integrity to the prosperity even of our worldly
affairs: these men are m blinded by their cova-

MATERNAL AFFECTION.

1. Womszﬁs charms are certainly many and
pogeerful. The expanding tom jam bursting

altar, awakens edrriiratien and interest, and the
blush of her cheek ﬁlls wit.li deliglit; but the
charm of maternity is more sublime thzm all these.

2. Heaven has imprinted in the mother’e face
something heyonrl this week}, something which
claims kimlrecl with the skies; the rmgelick smile,
the tender look, the waking, \va.tchful eye, which
keeps its fond vigil over her r~.lu1nberir'1g babe.

3. Tlieee are objects which neither the pencil
nor the chisel can touch, which poetry fails to exalt,
which the mo.-st eloquent tongue in vain would
eulogize, and on which all description becomes in--

4. In the heart of man lies this lovely picture;
it lives in his synrpatliies; it reigns in his ell‘ec~
tions ; his eye looks around in \"3.ll1 for such rm-
other object on earth.

5. Maternity, ecstatick sound 3 so twined round
our hearts, that they muet ceztee to throb ere we
forget it! it is our ﬁret love; it is part of our re-
ligion.

THE MAN WITH ONE BAD HABIT.

1. Mn. l}'p'roN, of Ceiiibridge, was the son of a
poor, industrious shoemaker. He learned his fa~
tliefs trade, and being prudent and steady, he
was S001} in the way of xnaking a comfortable lit—
tle property.

2. He married (1 worthy }*oung vcomen, who al—
xtwtye IIhEtI1{1g(:{ll0 make their own neat ﬁre-side
the most pleasant place in the wliole world to her
hard-working lmsband.

3. The floor xms a.lwa}'s nicely sanded, the
hetmli swept clemgend £1 plentiful kettle of warm
broth or soup was always provided for his return.

4. Things were in this state at the commence-
ment of the revolutioimry v»*m'. Then Mr. Upton
felt it his duty to join the ariny.

5. It was no doubt a. sad trial to the honest man
to leave the place, where he had spent so many

happy hours ; but his wife and children must be e
de

ended ; so he buckled on his sword, and, \vith~
out Ihedding it tear. he hurried to the camp.

Jvn~::~nx..s: nmvrzn. 47

6. His cotzrage and good conduct were soon
noticetl by the 0ll’1c»£:res', and he was made one of
Washington’.~3 life-gimrrl. Like every one else,
who know that great and  man, he soon loved
him with unbounded €tl.mCl))‘Tl8Dt and respect.

7. While the general had his head quarters at
Cmnlwrirlyzo, it wars frequently necessary for detach
merits of the tinny to mziko excursions into the
ncigl1l)or1r'ix1g towns-,=.

8. On one of t.l1cse2 occz1.<:ions, \\’asl1ington and
his life-guard were pm:-iauod by :1 company of
British soldiers. Tlroy retired as rapidly as pos-
szil)le, but the Engllzsh being cloxe upon their rear,
they were often obliged to turn and ﬁglit.

9. In the midst of the retreat, an Englishman
had just raisecl his: sword above the head of the
general, \\'l‘t(?.n Mr. Upton sprang forward and
placed his body l)ot\\*or:n him and the commander.
Tlio upliltcd weapon rleoocxxdod upon his thigh,
and cirippled him for life.

10. After tlmy had safely affected their return
to the Americmi lmrrzrckse, Wasliingzton called to
inquire concerning theman,wl1o had so generous-
ly preserved his life at the risk of his own.

11. “ 'I‘l1anks lye to God, my general, that your
life is saved,” exclaimed the wounded soldier;
“ America. could lose outzh «:1 man as I am, but
what could she do without your honour?”

12. His wound disabled him for battle, but he
continued to perform various: services to his coun-
try until the close of the war. After 

48 conrrs

country in the possession of peace and freedom, he
returned to his home.

13. True, it was now almost demlated and com-
fortlese. No one had been left to cttlttivate his
smtdl farm; and what little stock he possessed had
been killed for the use of the ziriny. America
was then too poor to pay their soldiers for tirhat
they had lost and stttfererl; and Mr. Upton was
obliged to contend with poverty as he could.

14. Hisltt1rd~ea1‘t1ed bread, liowever, was sweet-
ened by the respect wliieli was every where paid
to him. ‘When he swung his axe over his shoulder,
and went forth to labour in the woods, he was al-
ways welcomed with smiling looks and e. cordial
shake of the hands from his companions ; and the
older boys would often call out to their little
brothers, “ Otl‘ with your ha Joe, and make a
bow, for there is the man wh saved the life of
General Waslxington.”

15. The poor soldiers of the revolution had but
few of those comforts, winch now make our fire-
aidm so cheerful; but when the long winter even-
ings come on, dearly did they love to tight their
bottles over again, and often would they so to
Mr. Upton, “ The loss of your limb in sue a
cause, neighbour, is a greater honour to you, than
if you had King Geor :93 crown upon your head.”

16. The team wool sornetfimm trickle down his
cheeks, as he replied, “ The Lord make us thank-
ful thathit sags! his bonour’s life. It is little Vt:

17'. Now, rny young rezulere, this was in 1784,
which you all ought to rcmexnber was the year
after Great Britain acknowledged the independence
of America; and can you believe that only four
years after, when General llfaehington dmired an
interview with Mr. Uptozr, he was ashamed to
grant it 1?

18. Yes! the man, whose bravery saved his
general; whose integrity won the respect of his
neighbours ; whose industry had procured a com-
fortable home; and whose kindness had ensured
him an affectionate fa1hily,gave‘way to the sin of
intemperance.

19. Once hie little ones used to run out eagerly
to kl:~“~:=; his healthy, good-humoured countenance;
but now he had become so cross and troublesome
that clrildren were afraid of him. His ﬁrm, bold
step, had become weak and trembling with in-
toxication; and his round, handsome face, was
new red and bloated.

20. When Washington visited‘ Eexv England,
he sent a servant to request a visit from his. old
prwerver. The wretched man heard the sum-
mons, and wept aloud. “Heaven knows,” mid
he, “ that in my best days, I would have walked
from here to Mississippi, for the honour which
Washington now pays me.

‘Pun Author has long considered that a series of elementary
Reading‘-Books, which shall contain a greater variety of subjects;
better adapted to the capacities and tastes of children than any
now in use, would be an acquisition to our already extended list
of Class-Books. _ . f ,

Works designed for instructing children in reading, should
treat of such subjects as are within the range of their experience,
pleasing to their imaginations, and chaste and progressive in style
and matter; for, it must __be obvious to every reflecting‘ 
that the rudiments of correct reading are more likel toibép ac-
quired when the subject and language are easily un erstood

while the subject matter should be within the reach of the child’s.

capacity, care shouldylikewise be taken that it be of a useful and
moral tendency. The practice "of giving children dialogues ‘be.-
tween wolves and sheep, cats and mice, &c. &c., often met with
in elementary Reading-Books, containing statements and details
of things which never did, and which never can take place, is as
destructive of truth and morality, as it is contrary to the prin-
ciples of nature and philosophy. ' i

. In preparing these numbers, great pains have been taken so i

to arrange the different lessons, as to lead the child by a regular
radation from easy to diﬂicult reading, to adapt the subjects to
iis advancement, and to place before him such matter, and such
only, as shall convey to the juvenile mind correct views, and e'ust
principles of morality. It has also been the particular aim 0 the

conquest, but in the 1“ltZl1n%‘S of his spoil.

3. In the other methods of atttack, in the other
forms which death assumes, the {cable and the
aged, who at the best can live but a. short time, are

JUVENILE READER. 51

usually the victims; here they are the vigorous
and the strong.

‘4. It is remarked by the most ancient of poets,
that in peace children bury their parents, in war
parents bury their children; nor is the diﬁ"erence
small.

5. Children lament their parents, sincerely in-
deed, but ‘with that moderate and tranquil sorrow,
which it is natural for those to feel who are con-
scious of retaining many tender ties, many anima-
ting prospects.

6. Parents mourn for their children with the
bitterness of despair; the aged parent, the widow-

ed mother, loses, when she is deprived of her chil-

dren, every thing but the qapacity of suffering;
her heart, withered and desolate, admits no other
object, cherishes no other hope. It is Rachel,
weeping for her children, and refusing to be com-
forted, because they are not.

'7. But to conﬁne our_ attention to the number
of slain, would give us a very inadequate idea of.
the ravages of the sword. The lot of those who
perish instantaneously may be considered, apart

from religious prospectsgggs comparatively happy,-i

since they are exempt f1'of’n those lingering ‘diseases
and slow torments to which others are liable.

a stranger, or an enemy, without being sensibly
moved, and promptedby compassion, to lend him
every assistance in our power. Every trace of re-
sentment vanishes in a ,moment ; every» other.
emotion gives way to pity and terrour.

posed to the piercing air, while the blood, freezing

TO TEACHERS.

The practice of teaching a child to read before he is familiar with the
orthography and pronunciation of words, is productive of great injury,
and tends to retard rather than facilitate correct reading. No erson
should attempt to read until he is able to call or pronounce, at sig t, the
words most commonly met with in com osition; and, this can be more
easily acquired by reading words in a 311 icious and analogical classiﬁca-
tion in a Spelling-Book, than in detached reading lessons.

The Author has already published a small or “First Book,” and a
" Spelling-Book,” in which all the words in general use are arranged in
classes according to the peculiar vowel and consonant sounds, and cnl~
culated to render eat? and familiar, the principles of Walkers system
of pronunciation. 0 these works, he begs leave to refer those who
may use these numbers ; and, he would respectfully suggest the proprie-
tyof ac-customing the child to pronounce the words in the spel ing lea-
aons, Without naming the letters, until he shall be_quite familiar with

‘them, a practice which will tend greatly to facilitate his reading, by
1

enabling im to associate the pronunciation of words with the characters
which compose them, to render his enunciation clear and distinct, and
free him from those embarrassrnents which too .fre uently terminate in
n conﬁrmed habit of stammering. This practice t e Author pursued
for years while engaged in the business of teaching with results entire-
l satisfactory ' and his experience imboldene him to recommend it to
one intrust with the instruction ofyoutli.

MONEY.

1. MONEY is any piece of metal, usuallygold,
silver, or copper, stamped by publick authority, and
used as the medium of commerce.

2. ,Gold and silver, containing great value in a
small compass, and being therefore of easy con-
veyance, and being also durable and little liable to
diminution by use, are the most convenient metals
for coin or money, which is the representative of
commodities of all kinds, of lands, and of every
thing that is capable of being transferred in com-
merce. . i ,

3. Metal money, which is stamped, is called

coin. The American coin of the greatest value

is the eagle, equivalent to ten dollars, and the half
¢agle,§eqt1al to ﬁve dollars; they are made of gold.
4.’§?Dolla1's, half, and quarter dollars, dimes and

JUVENILE -READER. 65

half dirnes,.are made of silver. Cents, one hun-
dred of which make a dollar, are made .of copper.

5. Metal money being heavy, and consequently
inconvenient to carry in large quantities, bank
notes or bills of credit were invented toremedy this
inconvenience. '

6. The directors of a bank, instead of circulating
coin or the property of the bank, issue notes or
bills stamped with the value of the money or coin
for which they are a substitute.

7. All paper moneys.are made redeemable by

the directors of the banks who issue them, in coin,

gold, silver, or copper, equivalent to thevalue for
which they were issued. Barter or exchange was
practised, before money was invented.

8. Some people think if they have a great deal
of money they shall be happy. But if We have
much more money than We need, we are not hap-
pier for it. ,

9. We should take care of our money, and not
spend it foolishly; but we should not love it too
much.

10. We can alwaysﬁnd opportunities to expend
our money in assisting the poor and distressed, if,
We have more than we actually need.

HEAT.

.1. HEAT, as a cause of sensation, that is, the
matter of heat, is considered to be a subtitle ﬂuid,
contained in a greater or less degree in all bodies.

2. In modern chymistry, it is called calorick.
pg 3. It expands all bodies in different proportions,
and is the cause of ﬂuidity and evaporation.’

4. A certain degree of it is also essential to ani-
mal and vegetable life.

5. Heat is latent, when so combined with other

matter as not to be perceptible. It is sensible, when

it is evolved and A perceptible. .

.6. Heat, as a sensation, IS the effect produced
onthe sentient organs of animals, by the passage
of calorick, disengaged from surrounding bodies,
to the organs.

7. When We touch or approach a hot body, the
calorick or heat passes from that body to our or-
gans of feeling, and gives the sensation of heat.

8. On the contrary, when we touch a cold body,
the calorick or heat passes from the hand to that
body, and causes a sensation of cold.

THE DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND GIRL.

1. IN the city of Hartford, Connecticut, among
other interesting institutions, is an asylum for the
education of the deaf and dumb. The building is
large and commodious, and ﬁnely situated upon a
commanding eminence. r

2. Among the inmates of the mansion is one,
who particularly excites the attention of strangers.
She is entirely deaf, dumb, and blind. Her name
is Julia Bruce ; and she is a native of the imme-
diate neighbourhood of the asylum.

3. She was the daughter of exceedingly poor
parents, who had several "younger children, to
whom she Was in the habit of showing such of-
ﬁces of kindness as her own afflicted state ad-
mitted. ,   e

4. When the weather became cold, she would
occasionally kneel on the floor of their humble
dwelling, to feel Whether the other children of the
family were furnished with stockings or shoes,
While she was without, and Would express uneasi-
ness at the contrast;

5. Seated on her little block, weaving strips of
thin hark, with pieces of leather and thread,¥W“hich
her father in his process of making shoes rejected,
she amused herself by constructing for her cat,
bonnets and vandikes, not wholly discordant with
the principles of taste. a r

6. Her mother sometimes left  with the-‘care
of the young children.  On one occasion, she dis-

68 coBr3’s

covered that her sisters had broken a piece of
crockery, and imitating what she supposed would
be the discipline of their mother, gave the offender
a blow. V

'7. But placing her hand upon the eyes of the
little girl, andascertaining that she wept, she im-
mediately took her in her arms, and with the most
persevering tenderness soothed her into good hu-
mour and conﬁdence. r

8. Her parents were at length relieved from the
burden of her maintenance, by some charitable
individuals, who paid the expenses of her board
with an elderly matron, who kept a school for
small children.

9. Here her sagacity was continually on the
stretch to comprehend the nature of their employ-
ments, and, as far as possible, to imitate them.
Observing that a great part of their time was oc-
cupied with books, she often held one before her
sightless eyes with long patience.

10. She would also spread a newspaper for her
favourite kitten, and putting her ﬁnger on its
mouth, and perceiving that it did not move like
those of the scholars when reading, would shake
the little animal, to express her displeasure at its
indolepce and obstinacy.

11. But her principal solace was in the employ-
ments of needlework and knitting, which she had
learned at an early age to practise. Counterpanes,
beautifully made by her, of small pieces of calico,
were repeatedly disposed of, to aid in the purchase
of her wardrobe; i

-12. It was occasionally the practice of gentle-
men, who from pity or curiosity visited her, to
make trial of her sagacity, ~ by giving her their
watches, and employing her to restore them to the
right owner.

13. They would change their position with re-
gard to her, and eachstrive to take the watch that
did not belong to him .; but though she might at
the same time hold two or three, neither stratagem

nor persuasion would induce her to yield either of.

them, except to the person from whom she had re-
ceived it. t

14. Though nurtured in extreme poverty, and
after her removal from the parental roof, in the
constant habit of being in contact with articles of
dress or, food, which strongly tempted her desires,
she has never been known to appropriate to her-
self, without permission, the most triﬂing object.

15. And, in presenting her any gift, it is neces-
sary, before she will consent to accept it, to assure
her repeatedly, by a sign which she understands,
that it ‘is for her. i

16. Continuing to become an object of increased
attention, and her remote situation not being con-
venient for the access bf strangers, application was
made for her admission into the asylum, and per-
missien was accorded by the directors in the suin-
mer of 1825.

17. As soon as she was admitted, she busied
herself in qtiietly--exploring the size of ‘ the apart-
ments, and heightof,‘ the staircases ; and now she
never makes a falsestiep upon a ﬂight ‘of stairs, or

possible to displace a single article in her drawers,

19. If any part of her dress requires mending,
she is prompt and skilful inrepairing it, and her
perseverance in this branch of economy greatly di-
minishes the expense of her clothing.

20. Julia Bruce leads a life of perfect content~
ment, and is, in this respect, both an example and

21. The genial inﬂuences of spring Wake her

EMULATION WITHOUT ENVY.

1. FnANK’s father was speaking to a frfiend,

alone day, on the subject of competition at school,
He said,“ that he could answer for it, that envy is

‘not the necessary ‘consequence of competition at

school; he had been excelled by many, but he

could not recollect ever having felt envious of his

successful rivals ; or,” added he, “did my winning
many. a prizefrom my friend Birch ever diminish
his friendship for me.”

2. In support of the truth’ of what Frank’s’

father had asserted, the friend, who was present,
related an anecdote, which had fallen under! his

sown observation, in a school in his neighbou1'~

hood.

3. At this school, the sons ,of several, wealthy
farmers, and others, who were poorer, received in-
struction. i Frank? listened with great attention,
while the gentleman gave the following account

of the two rivals:
4. “It happenedthat the son of a rich farmer,»

and of a. poor widow, came in competition for the
monitorship of their class, They were so nearly
equal, that the master could scarcely depicle, be-
tween them ; 2 some days one, and some days the
other, gained thehead of the class. It was deter-
mined, by seeingfvvho should be at the head of the
class for the greater number of days in thevvaeek.

5. 1“ The widow’s son, by the last claylss an-

swer, gained the victory, and maintained  places

73 com’:

the ensuing week, till the school was dismissed for
the vacation or liolydays.

6. “ When they met again he did not appear,
and the farmer's; eon being next in excellence,
might I10\\'htt‘V€: been at the head of his class; but
instead of seizing that vacant place, which had
devolved to him, by the nowappearance of his ri-
ral, he went to the tx'idow‘s house to inquire what
could he the cause‘ of her .=:ms absence.

7. “ Poverty‘ was the cause ; she found that she
was not able, witli her utmost endeavours, to con-
tinue to pay for his tuition, and for the necmary
books, and the poor boy had returned to daylo-
bour, as it was his duty, for her support.

8. “ The fo.rmer’s. son, out of the allov.*e.nee of
pocket-n1oney,,tt'liich his father gave him, and
without letting any one but the widow and her
can know what he did, bought all the neéesstuy
books, and paid for the tuition of his rival, and
hrought him back again to the head of his clam,
where he continued to be monitor for o. considera-
ble time, at the expense of hi;-3 generous rit’nl.”

ry. Mary came up to ask what pleased him m
much, and he repeated it to her with deﬁﬁlﬁs

THE AIR-BALLOON-

1;. I HAD the pleasure yesterday,',a:s{said Edward,

iir*.e%a letter to 'Wi_lliam,},p‘f seeing a sight which

was perfectly new to me ; and, as a description of
it; may very probably be so to you, I shall make it
the-rsubjectsof a” letter. i

2. It had been announced for some time past in
our’ town, ‘tl1at‘~a- person wasilto ascend inan air;
balloon-'fro;mi an adjoining ﬁeld, some day this
week, and ‘preparations ‘were’ made by the r owner
for aciiommodating "a number of spectators...

3. Brit ~befo’re,I proceed, I shall tell‘ you some~
thing about the nature of air~balloons, as my fa-
ther was so good as to explain it ytevgme tbeforieiil
went to see it.

4. You know that every where above us is ﬁlled
with air, which is ‘a transparent ﬂuid like water",
only a great dealclighter. And as in Vvatergeveryi
thing lighter than itself vﬁill rise up through it, so

pwhatever islighter thang, air -will rise in it, till it

comes to air still lighter than itself. Thus We see
smoke ascend throiughfthe air till it all disappears.

45. Now, if smoke were eased in a ballfof very
iine paper, or tsilk, it would mount inthe air, till
the smoke tvasgrfotvns cold, when it wouldfbecome
heavier and fall again; and this, my father says,
was the ﬁrst notion of the inventor of balloons,
who contrived a   ball of silk, into which fresh
smoke was continually conveyed by a ﬁre of Wet
straw burning beneath.

7*

78 cores’:

i A6. But the chymists having found a A kind of
airmuoh lighter than common air, it was thought
better to fill the ball, or balloon, with this, as it
would not want a fresh supply, or be in danger of
taking ﬁre.   '

'7. So the way is, to make a globe of some ﬁne
materials, so large,; that when ﬁlled, with this very
light ‘air, the weight of the whole shall be a great
deal less than that of an equal bulk of common
air; in’ which case, it‘ will rise,- andij carry up with

it‘ any additional weight that will“7still' leave it

lighter than common air‘; just as a large cork
would rise through Water, though 83. Small piece of
lead were hung to it ; and now you know as much
of the matter as I do,

8, My father and I took seats upon a kind of
stage, where we 4 saws a very large globe with
gay stripes of diﬁ‘erent colours, held by several
men with cords, while it was filling with air,‘ by
means of pipes coming from a number of tubs, in
which we were told tl1"e2'e were i1'on—ﬁlings and
oil of vitriol, (sulphuric-k ‘acid 3) for ‘this light air
proceeds from iron while dissolving in a strong
acid.

9. The balloon gradually swelled, like a bladder
when it is blown up, and at last became almost
round, and it obliged the men to pull hard by the
ropes to keep it down, '

10,_ There was hung to it something like a boat,
\Vh.lt3l1.th6y called a car, painted prettily, and sur-
rounded with net~work. When all was ready, 3.
man came, and, after pulling off his hat to the

wvnm-Ln anannn. T9"

company, who».=g“avex him a: cheer, boldly stepped‘

into the car, and sat down.

11. At last, the -cords which held the balloon,
were cut, and it rose slowly from the midst of the
crowd of spectators, all gazing at the wonderful
sight. I shall never forget what I felt. Imagine
a globe as large as your great hall ascending ma...
jestically into the air, with a man hanging beneath,
who waved a ﬂag he held in his hand, while he
was gradually lessening to view. ,

12. The balloon ﬁrst rose nearly straight, and
then was carried ‘gently by the wind to one side,
while it still continuedlmounting higher and high-
er. The day was ﬁne ; but there were some
clouds in the sky, into which the balloon at length
entered, and for a time was lost to our sight. We

then saw." it’ again, not larger in appearance than ,

a paper kite,‘ and the car no larger than one of the
knots in the tail of the kite,

13. When I thought that there was a human
creature flying away at that amazing height in
the_ air, noboclyfcould guess whither, my blood
ran cold, and -I wished for nothing so muchaas
that he were safe down again, At last, the bal-
loon was no "longer to be seen, and we returned
home full of anxiety. i

'14- Before night, however, we were informed

by some Amen who rode after it, I do not mean-
through the air, but on the ground, 4 that it do-

scended about ﬁfteen miles oﬁ", having gone that
distance in less than half an hour.‘
  15. Perhaps’ you will say, why should it come

lived, enjoying the delights of their virtue and af-
fection. Each suceectling season returned to shed
its blessings upon them. The parents were kind,
and the children dutiful.

4. But there is no lasting happiness here below.
A sad change was to take place in this little oom-
pany, and the tie of love that so united them, was,
for the first time, to be broken. Mr. Halyard was
taken extremely sick with a fever. Although he
was very weak, yet he had not lost his reason, and
his mind xwrae composed. He perceived that the
physician had no hope of his living.

5. Mr. Halyard said, that while he was able to
speak, he wanted his children to be called, that he
might talk to them. Having been raised up in
his bed, he waited a short time, and then said,
“ My dear children, I see you are much grieved to
think your father must die, and leave you; but
such are the ways of God. that even in this seem-—
ing evil, there is some Wise design for your good.

6. '*' He who madeus, is all-powerful, wise. and
just. It is His law that all things here shall pass
away. All the people in the world must die.
Their bodies turn to dust 2 but our souls will
never die. Our souls will go to another world, to
be punished if we have‘ been wicked, and, if we
have been good, to enjoy everlasting blim. You
will not stay long in this world. It is only to try
you, and to prepare you for a better one.

7. “ It seems; but a. short time, my deal’ 3801!,

8. “ He is a. kind parent, and has said, He will
not forsake those who put their trust in Him. His
Word is true. Of this He has given me‘ proof, in

the trying scenes through which I have passed;

and you know, fmy children, I have great reason

.to~be thankful.”

9. Here Mr. Halyard was obliged to stop speak-
ing-, for he was very weak; and theytgave him
some drink in‘ a glass to wet his mouth. _The
bright sun was just shining into the room. = “ So,”
said this good man, “the sun of "my life is going
down, and no rising sun will shine again on me,
till the last morning shall beam on the wor,ld.
W10. “ ‘It is true I am yet in the prime of H man-
hood,‘ andit is hard parting from you, my dear
children, i and from your dear mother; from my
good friends; from all the tender, recollections and

will be your mother’s protector; He -will be your
father. While you are yoimg, remember this
great God. Never speak’ His name but with rever-

"ence., Strive to do His will. Remember that His H

eye is always upon you, and thatno evil deed can
be concealed from Him. Thinks what He has
done for me, and what He will do for all, who love
andobey Him.

13. “ What your fortune is to be in the World

tell.) I have but little to leave you,- except a name
unstained, and a.-f_ather’s blessing. If you do ,well

17. The next morning, about daybreak, having
his senses to the last moment, he prayed his great

pleasant and solemn, he said to those about him,
“ Farewell, good friends,” and died as calnily an

INDIA RUBBER, OR SYRLYNGE TREE.

1. No substance is yet known, which is so lia»
ble, and at the same time so elastick, as India ub-
ber. The tree from which it i: produced is called
the Syringe tree, and is a. native of Cayenne and
other parts of South America. -

2. This substance oozes out under the form of
a. vegetable milk, from incisions made in the tree,
and is chieﬂy gathered in the time of rain, because,
though it may be collected at all times, it ﬂows
then most abundantly.

3. It thickens and hardens gradually, by being
exposed to the air; and as soon as it acquires a
solid consistence, it xnanifests a very extraordinary
degree of ﬂexibility and elasticity.

4. The Indians make boots of it, which water
one not penetrate, and which, when smoked, have

Q the appearance of real leather.

5. Bottles are also made of it, to the neck of
which are fastened hollow reeds, so that the 

Jovemnn ruumzn. 55

oontained in them may be forced through the reeds,
or pipes, by pressure, whence it obtained the name
of syringe tree.  

6. One of these, ﬁlled with water, is always
presented to each of their guests, at their entertain-
ments, who never fail to make use of it before
eating.

7. Flambeaux, an inch and a half in diameter,
and two feet long, are likewise made of this resin,
{which give a beautiful light, have no bad smell,
and burn twelve hours. A kind of cloth is also
prepared from it, which the inhabitants of Quito
apply to the same purposes as our oil-cloth and
sail-cloth. _

8. This substance is formed, in fire, by means
of moulds, into a variety of ﬁgures for use and or~
nament; and the process is said to be thus: the
juice, which is obtained by incision, is spread over
pieces of clay, formed into the desired shape; and
as fast as one layer is dry, another is added, till
the vessel becomes of a proper thickness.

9. The whole is then held over a strong smoke
of vegetables on ﬁre, whereby it is hardened into

the texture and appearance of leather ; and, before

the finishing, while .yet soft, it is capable of having
any impreaesion made on the outside, which re-
mains ever after. When the whole is done, the
inside would is picked out.   ,

10. Among us, great use is made of it by point-
ers and others, for Jobbing out black-lead '
marks; it is also made into tuba. and employed
in various complaints by gorgeous.

CHARACTER OF‘ A TRUE FRIEND.

I. CONCERNING the man you call your friend,
tell me, will he weep with you in the honor of dis-
tress ‘.3 W ill he fnltllftllly reprove you to your
face, for £tCtlOl‘lS for xvlixiclt others are ridiculing, or
censoring you, behind your back ‘.1 Will he dare
stand forth in your rlofoncc, when detmction is

2. Will he acknowlerlgc you with the same§cor-
diality, untl belmvo to you with the some friendly
attention, in the oonipouy of your superiours in
rank and fortune, as when the claims of pride or
vanity do not interfere with those of friendship?

3. If misfortunes and losses should oblige you to
retire into the walk of life, in which you can not
appear with the stune distirnction, or entertain your
friends with the sauna liherality as formerly, will
he still think himself lmppy in your moiety?

4. And instead of gradually withdrawing him-

in professing ltimssolf your friend; and cheerfully as:
sist you to support the burden of your aﬁiictions ’.1

5. When ‘sickness shall call you to retireyfrom
the gay and busy scenes of the world, will he fol-
low you into your gloomy retreat, and listen with
attention to your tale of we 1? Will he administer
the halmof consolation to your fainting spirit?

6. And, lastly, when death shall burst mundcr
every eztrthly tie, will he shed a tear upon your

grave, and lodge the deer remembrance of your
mutual friendship in his heart, as a treasure never
to he resigned? The man who will not do all
this, may be your companion, your ﬂattcrer, your
seducer; but he is not your FRIENIJ.

 

OXEN.

1. Oxm: is the general name given to horned
cattle. These animals differ much in size. A
let   e, full grown bullock, is usually about five feet
in eight, and seven feet in length, from its fore»-
heed to the end of its back. It lies a stout heed,
bulky body, long tail, and rather short legs.

2. The skin is tough, and covered with thick,
soft hair. The ox is of a sluggish nature, ve
strong, yet gentle. There are oxen in nearly :11
parts of the world. Those of Egypt, about the
river Nile, are as white as snow, and of a very large
size.

3. The cow is the female of the ox. She re»
sembles the ox in shape and appearance, except
that her head is smaller. Some cows and oxen
are without home.

4. The natural dwelling places of these animals
are the fields, which supply them plentifully with
various kinds of grass and herbage, on which they
ciontentedly feed. ,

5. There they mminate,‘ or chew the cud :i in
other words, after they have swallowed the grace

$ coma’:

down into their etomeehe, it rises up, and returns
into their mouths, where they slowly chew it over
again. .

6. The cow, perhaps, is more useful to mankind
than any other animal. She supplies us with
great quantities of milk, from the use of which
mankind in general, but particularly children, de~
rive the greatest nourishment. The milk, when
churned, is made into butter; and, when ourdled,
is pressed into cheese. —

7’. These animals are of various colours; they
also differ much in the appearance of their heads;
and some have short, while others have long horns,
with which they can easily toss up into the air a
large dog, or other weighty thing.

8. The ﬂesh of these animals aﬂbrds that moat
rmtritious food called beef, so much valued and de-
sired by mankind at large. Their skips, when
properly prepared, become leather, which serves
for boots, shoes, and irizmy other useful purposes.

9. Of their horns are made combs, boron,
handles for knives, ‘and drinking vessels; aml,
when softened and out thin, they are used to make
the trans   rent sides of lanterns.

10. Th: large bones are used to form many at-
ticles, which, in the whitened; of their appearance,
nearly resemble ivory, and the smell bones pro-
duce an oil, which is much used to clean harness,
imdl the trappings belonging to a coach.

11. Their blood is an excellent manure hr
ﬁuit-tunes, and '3 the chief ingredient employed in

:t:vr:.xrr.r: nnanrzn. 89

manufacturing that fine colour called Prussian
blue ; it is also much used in reﬁning sugar.

12. Glue is made of the gristlee and finer pieces
of cuttings and paringe of the hides, boiled in we»
ter till they are reduced to it gelly, and then dried.

13. In short, the blood, fat, marrow, skin, hair,
horns, hoofs, liver, gall, bones, and milk, have all
their particular uses in manufactures, commerce,
and medicine.

INGRATITUDE, OR INKI..E AND YARICU.

1. AMONG the various vices to which human
nature is prone, and which mark the degradation
it has suffered, none more strikingly evince its do-
basement than the practice of ingratitude.

2. For other vices, and other failinga, reason
may be able to assign a cause; but for that she

must search in vain. That kindness should ever

be returned with cruelty, or affection be treated
with neglect, is humanity’s shame, and man’s dis-
grace. .

3. Mr. Thomas Inkle, a young London mer~
chant, was the third son of a wealthy citizen, who
had carefully instilled into his mind a love of gain,
and a desire of acquiring wealth; and this pro-
pensity, which he had imbibed from precept, and
felt from nature, was the grand inducement for
him to try his fortune in the West Indies. Inklo’s
person was absolutely the reverse of his mind; the

4. Ditriiig the voyage, the Achilles, the name of
the vessel in wliich he embarked, put into a creek
to avoid the fury of it $tOI‘I1‘t; and young Inkle,

5. Tliey llitd not walked far up the country be»

and fear and apprehension lent wing“9 to their
ﬂight. Inkle outrau his cempantiens, and, breath»
less with terrouij, sought security? in the thicket of
:3. forest.

6. He had not been long in that forlorn situa-
tion, when his astonishment was called forth by
the appearance of a. yeung femelegwhwe benignant
ooimtennnce seemed instantly to compassionate his
forlorn situation. The name of the female was
Yarice.

7. Gentlenm and sweetness were displayed in
every feature; and when Inkle, by signs, acquaint-
ed her with his forlorn situation, she evidently

raved that e_vinpat.hy was conﬁned to no particuo
er clime, and that lminanity depends not upon the
colour of the skin.

8. The generous Indian was a woman of high
birth; and knowing that the tenderness she felt
for the unfortunate stranger would be displeasing
to her parents, she felt the necweity of

15. Love, which had been a transitory passion,
and which had acquired its foundation in interest,
now yielded to a superiour claim. His freedom
once obtained, the means were totally forgotten,
and the unfortunate Yarico considered as a tax
upon his bounty.

16. As soon as the vessel am't'ed at Barbadoee,
the merchants crowded round it for the purpose of
purchasing their slaves. The despicable Inlrle
was animated at the sight, and resolving to re-
lieve himself of what he considered as a burden,
offered the beauteoua Yarioo, his amiable deliverer,
to the highest bidder!

3. In your childhood, she mourned over your
little griefs; rejoiced in your innocent delights;
administered to you the healing balm in sickness;
and instilled into your mind the love of truth, of
virtue, and of wisdom. Oh ! cherish every senti-
ment of respect for such a mother. She merits
your warmest gratitude, esteem, and veneration.

 

AN ADDRESS TO YOUTH.

L YOUTH is the season proper to cultivate the
benevolent and humane affections.‘ As a great
part of your happiness is to depend on the con-
nexions which you form with others, it is of high
importance, that you acquire betimes the temper
and the manners which will render such can-
nexions comfortable. Let a sense of justice be
the foundation of all your social qualities.

2. Engrave on your mind that sacred rule, of
“ doing in all things to others as you wish they
would do unto you.” For this end, impress your-
selves with a deep sense of the original and natu-
ralequality of men.

3. Whatever advantages of birth or fortune you
posses, never display them with an ostentatious
superiority. Leave the uubordinationn of rank,

94 comma

to regulate the intercourse of more aulvaaced years.
At present it becomes you to act among your
companions as a man with man.

, 4. Remember how unknown to you are the vi-
cissitudes of the world; and how often they, on
whom ignorant and contomptuotis young men
once looked down with scorn, have risen to be
their superiours in future. years. Compassion is an
emotion of Wllltill you ought never to be ashamed.
Graceful in youth  the tour of sympathy, and

the heart that melts at the tale of wo.

5. Lot not ease and indulgence contract your
affections, and wrap you up in selﬁsh exijoynicnt.
Accustom yourselves to think of the distresses of
human life; of the solitary cottage, the dying
parent, and tho weeping orphan. Never sport
with pain and distress in any of your amuse-
ments, or treat even the meanest insect with
wanton cruelty.

FILIAL SENSIBILITY.

1; .A YOUNG gentleinan in one of the academies
at Paris, was remarked‘ for eating nothing bug
soup, and dry bread, and drinking only water?
The governour of _ the institution, attributing this
singularity to excess of devotion, reproved his pu-

96 coaB’s

pi], and endeavoured to persuade him to alter his
resolution.

' 2. Finding, liomzver, that his remonstrancee “*

were ineffectual, he sent for him again, and ob-
served to him, that such conduct was highly un-
becoming, and that it was his duty to conform to
the miles of the academy. He then endeavoured
to learn the reason of his pupils conduct; but as
the youth could not be prevailed upon to impart
the secret, the governour at last threatened to send
him back to his family.

3. This mcnace produced an immediate expla-
nation: “ Sir,” said the young man, “ in my fa-
thcr‘s house I eat nothing but black bread, and of
that very little; here I have good soup and excel-
lent white bread; and though I might, if I chose
it, fare luxuriously, I can not persuade myself to
take any thing else, when I reflect on the situation
in which I have left my father and motl1er.”l~

4. The governour was greatly moved by this
instance of ﬁlial eens.ibilit_v, and could not refrain
from tears. “ Your fatlier,” said he, “ has been in
the arrny ; has he no pension?” “No,” answered
the youth, ‘* he has long been soliciting one; but,
for want of money, has been obliged to give up
the pursuit; and rather than contract any debts at
Versailles, he has chosen a life of wretchedneae in
the country.”

5. “ Well,” replied the governour, “ if the
lactic as you have represented it, I  to to-
cure for your hther a pension of ﬁve h F
livree a year. And since your friend! are in so re-

duoed circumstances, take these three louis-d’or
for your pocket expenses. I will undertake to
remit your father the first half year of his pension
in advance.”

6. “ Ah, Sir !" replied the youth, “ as you have
the goodness to propose reniitting a sum of money
to my father, I cntreztt you to add to it these three
louis-d’or. As I have here every thing I can wish
for, I do not need them; but they would be of
great use to my father in the maintenance of hit
other children.”

THE BEAVER.

1. Tim beaver, which in an amphibious animal,
is very common in the northern parts of America.
He is about two feet long, and not quite one in
height.

2. In form he resembles a. rat, except in the tail,
which is broad and flat. The colour of the hair is
3. light brown, and the fur is of great value. The
teetlrnre fanned like those of the rat, and are well
adapted to the purpose of cutting down trees.

3. The beaver, when separated from his com-
prmions, and kept in a state of conﬁnement, ap-
pears to be a mild, gentle animal, devoid of -
sion, but inca ble of attachment, and notur y of
a morbid, meisncholy cast.

4. But, though solitude and conﬁnement have
such an eﬂect upon this animal, society produces a

9

98 conrfs

most astonishing change; for in his natural state,
we behold him ardent ancl persevering, and offer-
ing an instructive lesson to menlrind.

6. About the month of July, the beavers begin
to assemble for the purpose of forming that social
compact, which is to oontinue the greatest part of
the year; and, these communities generally con-
sist of two hundred of this ekilful and ingenious
race.

6. The place where they aseernble is always by
the side of :1 river, or lake; and, if they choose a
river, their first object is to form a dam across the
stream, whicli they sogeoiotlsly contrive in the
most .s:~.*l'1t'tl.l0\v part; and, if a. tree is accidentally
placed near the spot, they instantly resolve to out
it down, and in this enterprise succeed by gnawing
it at the root.

7'. When. the tree ie fallen into the river, they
proceed to gnaw off the branches. It then serves
as a. support to that fahrick which, with so much
labour, they are about to rear.

8. The work is then filled up with wood of vn-
rious sizes, which they have out and collected, and
interwoven together; and this is plastered over
with clay; against which they raise a large bank
of earth, ten or twelve feet thick at the bottom, and
sloping oil‘ from the water; till it is about two feet
thick at the top.

9. When the beavers’ dam is completed, they
build their hebitations near the land, but partly in
the water. Some of their houses are so large, an
to contain families of ﬁfteen or twenty beavers;

JUVENILE nmnnn. 99

and they have sometimes twenty or thirty houses
in one village. On a sudden alarm, they dive into
the water.

10. The beaver lives on wood of various kinds,
and roots. In eating, he sits like the squirrel, and
holds his food in his fore paws.

AFFECTION“ TO PARENTS.

1. AN amiable youth was lamenting, in terms
of the sincerest grief, the death of :1 most affec-
tionate parent. His companion endeavoured to
console him by the reﬂeétion, that he had always
behaved to the deceased with duty, tenderness, and

res Gt.

5 Sol thought, answered the youth, while m
parent was living ; but now I can recollect, wit
pain and sorrow, many instances of disobedience
and neglect, for which, alas ! it is too late to make
