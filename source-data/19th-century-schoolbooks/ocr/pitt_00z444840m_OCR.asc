successfully, a few sounds of vowels and consonants may
be taught by ear,.Without reference to the letters which
represent them. Afterward the analysis of simple mono-
syllables may be brought out, thus:

Teacher speaks the Word man. Pupil repeats-man.

Teacher: “Listen, and tell me what sound you hear ﬁrst,~—
m-m-mam.” The pupil is led to distinguish the sound, and to repeat
it,--m.

Teacher: “ Tell me what is the last sound you hear,-man-n-n.”
Pupil repeats the sound,——~n.

Teacher: “Listen again. W1 at do you hear between m and n,——-
m-a-n 2” Pupil gives the short sound of a.

Teacher: “Tell me again what is the ﬁrst sound you hear,-—-
m-a-n.” Pupil gives the so‘und,——-m.

Teacher, making the letter m upon the blackboard: “ When you
see that letter it means that you are to make the sound, m.” Point-
ing to the letter: “Make the sound.” Child repeats,——m.

In the same way the other sounds are taught. After which the
pupil may be led to combine the sounds; as, d.-m, (I-n, m-(1, m—d-n-.
In this manner teach the ﬁrst lesson, and proceed with each succes-
sive one, as fast as new sounds are introduced.

_ THE VOICE.
From the very beginning, children should be taught

to speak in pleasant conversational tones ; and the same-

tones are to be carried into their reading. To give ease
and naturalness, nothing is more important than to read
in phrases. Thus, “I can see,” should be spoken as
ﬂuently as if it were one word, like “ repartee.” The
articles a and the should always be joined to the follow-
ing word, as if they formed the ﬁrst syllable of it.

The ﬁrst steps in reading are to enable a child to
recognize on the printed page words with which he is
already familiar in speech. Every new word which
occurs in any lesson is therefore to be taught him in
conversation ‘before he meets with it in type.

Then We got out of the boat and
had a run in the Woods.

We heard a funny noise-—-—quaek,

a lot of ducks. They came to eat

She stooped down, and two doves
ate out of her hand.

Then one little white dove said,
“I know where the best crumbs

This pleased George very much.
He looked up into his Mamma’s

Jane. “The cat knows that she

So J a.ne went to the door; and,
when the cat saw her, it said
“Mew! mew! mew!” moreand
more loud.

Then she ran to the top of the
stairs, and said “Mew! mew!
mew!” as if she would like to say
“Come! Come as fast as you can !”

Jane went with the cat; and

ONCE I knew a boy Who took
a walk on the sea shore with his
father.

While they were there, the boy’s
father said, “ Do you see these men
getting into the beat ?”

“ Yes, sir,” said the boy.

“ You see, too, that they are
large men, and that it is a large
beat?”  
  “Yes, sir,” said the boy.

“Well,” said his father, “now
We will watch them, and when
they go away, they Will seem to

grow smaller and smaller. When

they are a great Way off on the
