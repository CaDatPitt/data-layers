40FORMATION OF THE CA_PIT_ALSART OF WRITING.
Tlhe follouwing chapter, with the annexed dialogues,
relates particularly to the 2d, 3d, 4th and 6th
book8s.
THE elegance of writing depenlds much upon the
natural aid easy slope of the letters, and the beauty
anid unliformity of the turns, both at top and bottom,
as well as on thle ploper distance of the letters from
each otller. It is well known, that children, when
finst belinning to write, are very apt to set their letters too upright.  This practice habituates tlhem to
an unnatural and awkward motion of the fingers, and
consequeiently prevents them front making handsome
oval turns; and while tihis hlabit conitinues it eff'ectually prevents tihem from writing ain easy and elegant
hand. To remedy the foleimentiont'ld inconvenience
of contraetillg an awkward habit of forlming   the letters, and to help cllildrim to give a propel slant to
letters, and to a natural motion of the fingers, I haive
made use of the period and the parallel or slanting
litns to great a(dvantage. By the hell) of these lines
the mind is wholly at liberty, and can now withl composure attend to a careful and slow movement of tlhe
pen, whichl is absolutely necessary for a learner
soon to form a proper oval turn, either at the top or
bottom of his letters.
By invariably practising on these lines at first, the
learner, by the strong force of habit, will of necessity
much sooner acquire a natural and easy motion of the
fingers, as well as the proper slope of the letters. In
sculpture, painting, music, &amp;c. learners have beea

Observations on the pressure and rise of the Pen,
as illustrated in the foregoing pages.
It may not be, amiss to mention the most essential fallts, to which clildren are subject in drawing
the leading strokes, that they may be more effectually gutardled against them.
1. Instead of pressing the pen sufficiently hlard
at thle,beginning of every letter, whlichl ought to be
square and ftlll upon the top, they are ever apt to do
the contrary, viz,. to strike tile pen light, and conseqiuently to leave the top shbarp.
2. They are likewise verly apt to press hardest
upon tile pen whelre it should rise, viz. at the bottom turn of all the letters.
3. They are likewise very apt in drawing the
body of the 1, as well as all tihe down strokes, and
in carrying.up all the hair strokes, to move the pen
much quicker thlan it oughIt to be moved by a
lealrner.
4. More especially are they apt to move the pen
the quickest where it shoultd be carried as slowly as
it possibly can be moved, viz. at the bottom turn of
all the letters; as there is a twofold motion of thle
pen required in this turn, viz. the pen mtst gradually rise from a full to a fine hair stroke, and at the
same time move to the right in a circular direction.
At the top ttun they are apt not only to move the
pen much too quick, but also to come to a full pressure at once before the turn is comlpleted.
With lregard to the movement of the open,ART OF] WRITING.
It is as necessary that learners sllould at first be
tautlht to observe a proper space of time for the righit
imovement of the pen, in order soon to draw the
strokes accurately, as it is that they shouldl be taught
to observe a proper time in plronouncing a word, or
in sounding the notes in music.*
This will appear obvious when we consider the
smallness of the space between wllere the pen must
I)e-in to rise and the line; this space being so minute, that if the pen be move(l with that rapidity of
motion, wlhichl learners are apt to do, and which is
geinerally allowed, it is drawn over this space muclh
sooner titan the minnd can p)ossibly perceive the
gradual cilange, which ought to take place, viz.
from a ftill to a fine hair stroke, as well as a contrary
dlirection, viz. fronm  a straight line to a circular one.
From the foregoing  observations may be inferred, that if the lead(ing strokes are to be (trawn in a
certain dlirection, and if they require the pen to be
pressed in one part, and eased or carried light in
anothler, in or(ler to have letters appear graceful to
the eye; then it is highly necessary for teachers to
help) the learner immediately to perceive whereinl
this symmetry anl dlue proportion consists, as well
as thle right movement of the pen, in order to effect
the operatioll required.
Nonw since it is impossible for the human mintl
It may be noticed here, that this very slow movement of
tle pen should not be practised after children have obtained a
good idea of a letter, and fully understand the rise andl preslire of the pen, &amp;e.

lhaving first fullly conceived of the simplle parts of
which it is composed, it is necessary that teacher.s.
as soon as possible, lelp the learner to a right idea
of the first, second, an(d third parts of each stroke.
If so, is it not beyonid dispute, tlhat oftentimes those,
who want the attention of the master most, have it
least? I mean those, who are just beginning to
write.
For, though it must be confessed that it is very
laborious, and needs great patience to reuIlate tlle
arm, paper, pen, &amp;e. as often as is needed, wlichl
for some weeks may be as often as every two or
three minutes; yet, as this must be attended to, )efore they can ever write with freedom and ease, it is
much the best to keep thlem right at first, before bad
hlabits are confirmed; as it will then be much harder
to correct them. Not oinly so, but the proficiency of
the pupils will abunlldantly compensate for the pains
necessary to produce the deiredl effect.
OF THE UISE OF THE DRY PEN.
ITr has bee)n observed, in the preceding palrt, of
this work, that two things should be first and principally attended to, in order soon to write a fair
hand.
t. T1he mind must be impressed with a just idea
of each principal stroke.
t. The. next thing is to learn the use of the pen,
and the righlt motion of the fingers.ART OF WRITING.                   vr
N ow, to oltaini botli these purposes, let this simple and easy, but ulseful method be practised.  let
tle learner be always furnished with two well made
penes, the onle of whichl shouldl be always used e.ntirely dry in the following manner.
Let the dry pen be drawn very slowly, and witl
great care, several times over eachl stroke or letter;
the learner observing at the same time very critically
where the pen should be pressed, in order to fill tlhe,
body part of the stroke, as well as to understand the
gra(lual rise of the pen from a full to a hair stroke,
without whlicht no person will ever be able to write a
lihandsoe iand.
After dra'wving the pen thus over the copy several times, let the learner, with ink in the otlher pen,
draw onIly five or six strokes, as slowly as possible,
rmememering g in wliat part the pen must ble pressed,
and in what part it Imust legin to rise, as his copy
hlas just taught him.  Then let the dry pen be dlrawn
several times over the stroke again, as before directed.  Iket this metlhlod be constantly practised, not
only in drawing the first strokes, and in making
single letters; but likewise at first writing joining
hland copies.
Whllen writing joining hand, one word only should
be traversed over several times, add then written,
before the scholar proceeds with the dry pen to another; as it is much easier to remember the right
joiningt of five, six, or seven letters only, than fifteen
or twentv.
This method will soon prove its utility; as byAR'T OF WRITING.

IDIALOGUE ON TIFE USE OF TlIE'DRY PE.N.
4. Q. What is meant lby thle dry) pen?
4.:It is a well made pen to be used without ink.
2. Q. IHow is the dry pen to be used?
4q. It is to be carefully drawn or traced over tlle
strokes or skeletons of letters before dhrawing the
same with ink.
3. q. WVhat is thle proper use and benefit of the
dry pen?
J. It is uised to teachl the learner the proper
movement, pressure, and rise of the pei. It is also
of great use thoroughly to impress the mind of tlle
pupil witlh correct idleas of the shape of the letters.
4. Q. What are we to understand by the pressure of the pen?
4. As all the stems andi body part of every letter
are to be drawn and filled to a proportionable thickness, that weight of the hand, whiclh spreads the nib
ufitcientdy to fill the strokes composing letters, may
be. called the pressure of the pen.
6r. Q, What do we understand by the rise of the
pen?
~4. It is that careful, nearly perpendicular mo.
tion of the pen, which is necessary when leaving theART OF WRITING.     5

&amp;. q. Does a carefuil andl prop)er uise of thie dry

9. Q. Rlow dloes the use of the dry pen hielp us
to undlerstand the pressuire andI rise- of the pen?
J. By a slow and careful use of the dry pen, tihe
learner is obliged constantly and( criticanlly to view

As it tends veiy mulch to the iniprovenlent of
yoittl. thfat their writing be m4ade a dliversion ratlier
tllan a task, proper meanlls should be takelin to keep
the attentionI of childrilen awake.
1. As one mealns to accomplish tlIis, let the old,
formal, clistomlary method of tyinlg children to tlhe
disagreeable task of writing ten or twelve lines of
the same copy be entirely tllrown aside.,'hio is there, even among those who hIave already attained the knowledge of writintg, tlat is i)ot
in some degree weary after writing only live or six
lines of the same copy? Variety is IIpasing to all.,
but especially to cihildren; while, a continual sameness is not only apt to tire, bIut also to create a

fiied to hlis seat, and to -,rite ten or tweelh'e lines of
tile saine copy, when he N was sufficiently tired in
writign half that numler.
Are not tihe cfl7eets of this very visible in tile
greater Ipadrt or chihrn's writing hooks, whllere this
formial method is practised?  Do not we often see
the Ilast lines of tileir copies by no m1ieans so correct
tas tihe formert?  No wondcl, therefore, that little or
no imi)rvenlent is nulde, while thieir employment is
niuchl morle a l)frden than a (liver, ion.
(llihdren shlould never he obfliged to write more
tllan four or five lines of one copy at a tinme; as thtere
are lbut very few copies, wslicll do not contain four
or five of the leaditlt strokes; anld as the letters in
all copies are mIade b)y thle same rule; there can be
no disadvantage in gratif-ying the fancies of children
in this respect.
2. As another meatls to fix the attention of chlildren, andl to make writin= anl amusCement to tthem, it
is advised tlhat a school never be kept to writing
more tihan thirty or forty minutes at a time; supposing (as it ouoht to be) that their whole attention for
thlis time is engaled in drasing every stroke or letter accurately, according to the platte.  After thiat
period of time. it would be well to let the whole
school rest for thie space of ten or fiflecn miniutes; ini
whlich time they may witll advantage amuse themselves by repeating a dialogue to eachl othler respecting- the letters, &amp;c. or let them be otherwise
amused, as the discretion of their instructor may
dictate.
t0ART OF WRITING.
It is granted tlhat this seems to be attended with
some little inconvenience. Notwitlhstanding it answers a very valuable purpose. By these means the
mindi may be kept from  being tired, and fitted for
closer application. This will make their learning
pleasant and aigreeable.
Thus would the minds of children be thoroughly
engaged, andl in this way they may attain more knowledge of writing in two or three months, than most
acqutire in as many years, where therre are uo means
used to fix their attention. Is it not evident, that a
child would acquire more skill in penmanship by
writing three or four lines with tlhe utmost care andl
attention, than by writing several whllole copies with
a heedless mimi,d without a desire to excel?
Tlle autllor of this work has not only often heard
tile common complaint of want of room in schools,
)but having been cmployed as a teachler in several
states of the Union, has himself, in numerous instances, to his great mortification, experienced the peculiar disadl-vantage of seeing his lpuIpils crowdled or
rather packed together in a small room, poorly lighted, with very unequial warmth, and the writing-tables
anid seats ill constructed.
From the too small size of schoolhouses, the
following great disadvantages arise.

posture is a great impediment to their learning iu

easily estimated.
As it was proposed, at a former session, that the Legislature shouhl print, or cause to be printedl at their expenise, a certain number of copies and distribute them amlong thle towns in

talents. The testimotials, which have been communicated to
the author, arc numerous: among others we would mention the

seven or eight years of age. The R1ev. 3Mr. Ilunting.ton states it
as fullyv his opinion--" that a complete set of books, comprising
this system, would be of more valule in his familv, to teach his
chiltdren a knowledge of this useful art, than 300 dollars expndsed in the common mnode of instructionl inasmiuch as children and youth may, by this method, acquire a fatir and even elegant land *writing, by way of amulsement and relaxation, and

After an intimate acquaintance with this system, the Rev.

Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Hon. Joseph Moffett of
Brimfield, and Rev. Charles Stearns, D. D. A,. S. of Lincoln,
state tlis: --   We do believe, that a complete set of tMr. Jenkins' books on penmanship, would be of more real use to a
family of half a dozeu children, than 300 dollars would be expended in learning them to write in the usual way."'STATEMENNT.

I r iE authior of the. following work has, since the year
I1781 been emtployed in ten states of the Union, as an'instructor in the art of writing. Diin,it period lhe has.
seen,~ with mutchi regret, the want of a proper, natural, and
e.asy method for acquiring an art, so necessary for the gentleiciatn anid tie, mian of buisiness.
The longIer lie continiued his employment, and the more lie
extendled his aequiain'tance with the hiand writing of diffierent
gentflemen andI lad(ies, the more! fuilly was hie convinced of the
importance oif somne alterationg in the contmon mode of insrt metioui.
To remnedy thiis deficiency, hef hias, withi mtuch studly, indefaiti"oable lao,and great expense of time and money,
composedl the following) System-thie result of long experienlce, whtich is, niow submiitted to the candid( public, utinder the

published, have taken the liberty to deviate from the original
plan, and have palmed their filched and mutilated works on
the public, under the idea of improvements. It may therefore
be here thought proper, that the discerning public should be
informed of the circumstances, by which the author was led
to the discovery of this new System of Writing.
At an early period of life, he was invited to enter upon the
useful employment of teaching a country school; but having
been tauglht the art of writing in the very imperfect manner
common in his childhood, more than forty years ago, without
system or rule, he was mortified at the thought of furnishing
his pupils with the very defective models of his own pen, for
their improvement in so elegant an art.
From his early youth he had been highly gratified by
examining beautiful specimens of penmanship, and felt a
strong desire to imitate them; but had, after frequent attempts, for years despaired of ever obtaining a handsome
hand-much less did he think himself capable of teaching
others to excel in the art, within a far shorter period than
usual.
At first he procured well written copies for the use of his
pupils; but he soon felt the truth of an observation made by
some of his employers, that a teacher ought to be capable of
instructing his pupils without a borrowed hand. This intimation at once inspired him with a renewed desire, not only
of his own improvement, but that of his pupils also, in the
art in which he felt himself so very deficient.
In his course of instruction, the author was led to a careful
and frequent inspection of the performances of his pupils,
and to criticise every letter, and parts of letters; thus, when
he observed a defect in the part of an n, m, h, p, &amp;c. he
required his pupils to draw several of these distinct parts,
and labored to correct the errors and defects of their pen;
showing them particularly how each part, or parts, of one
letter, was the part, or parts, of several other letters. This
mnode of instruction soon proved beneficial to his pupils, andfully convinced the author that it was the most rational and
expeditious method of teaching this art. In the year 1789,
at Bennington, Vermont, the author made a more thorough
experiment in teaching, being employed by several gentlemen
to instruct their sons in writing. Their improvement was
highly satisfactory to their parents, and the late Rev. Job
Swift, D. D. late Hon. Moses Robinson, Hon. Isaac Tichenor,
and Hon. Noah Smith, with other gentlemen, became zealous
patrons of his mode of instruction, and recommended him to
the public as an instructor of writing. In this way the author
still persevered, insensibly progressing towards a regular
System. At length he undertook a more minute analysis of
the letters. After several different dissections and arrangements, both of the capitals and small letters, he was highly
gratified to find, from this critical investigation, that nearly the
whole alphabet was composed of six principal strokes or
lines. These he arranged, named, and numbered, as in his first
book, and they are the proper foundation of the whole work.
These, with the sqheme annexed, which exhibits the component parts of the letters, he submitted to the inspection of the
Hon. William S. Johnson, late President of Columbia College, New York. This gentleman was highly pleased with
the plan; he said it was new to him, and encouraged the
author to prepare it for publication, at the same time assuring
him that he would give it his signature, when ready for the
Press.
The common practice of setting children to write without
giving them previous instruction, as to the proper ideas of
the shape and formation of the letters, is attended with much
greater disadvantages and embarrassments than is generally
imagined, as they must necessarily be wholly ignorant of
the proper mechanical movement of the pen.
In this way they have two difficulties at once to overcome;
one is, the obtaining a distinct idea of the letter; the other
is, learning the use of their pen; and in proportion as they
tare ignorant of the shape of the letters, they must be at a
ix
PREFACE.loss how to form  them--no person being able to make that
of which he hlas no conception. And as their attention must
be divided between the two beforementionedl objects, it is
impossible for them to obtain a proper idfea of eithler, as their
pen nmoves at random, lihaving nlo guide or director.
From this view of the sublject it is not surprising, that
elilhlren, in general, are obliged to spenl nlmany years in acquirinig even a moderate skill in the art of' w ritin., and that
after so great waste of time an(d stationary-, and other contiingent expenses, so fe tw arrive at any detxerity in it.
To ptut a pupil to writing, ulnder these disadvantages, is as
inconsistent as it wouhll be to set a lad to translate Virgil
berore hie had studied hiis Latin Gjranmmar. or to solve a ditfieult )rol)leml in imathenmaties, witlhout the knowledge of the
power of figures.
An ingenious icnlhanic 3will ever obtain, as far as possible,
a clear anll distitnct ideal of all thle component parts of the
mnachinle which he is about to fo)rm, otherwise hie miight labor
for months to no purpose. It is also allowed by all, thlat for a
youth to obtatin the knowledge. of any mechllanical art, lie must
be tautlght the nature atrid use of tools, before lie can iliake
proficiency.  Therefore, as writing is in some measure a
meehaniceal art, it should be melchanically taiught; and as
there is in nature a certain proportion for the heighlt and
breadth of a letter, wlhich strikes thIe eye agreeably, so there
is a natural and easy movement of the fingers aind pen, necessary to d(ran the letter with freedom, and wilhout w-hich
the pupil will labor in vain to acquire this useful and ornamental art.
The necessity of a System for teaching the art of writing
in a simple, eheap, and accurate nmanner, and in a short time,
will clearly appear, upon a due consideration of the following reasons: viz.
i. The laborious, tiresome, loag, and expensive way of
learning to write heretofore praetised.
2. The shortness of h.s-men life.

arising froni transcribing many limportant and instructive
htistorical sket-ches, and moral observations, and particularly
from ani early correspondenice witht others, fromn which they
miight receive mnany advantages.
The authior remembers, that in conversation withi the celebrated Doct. Rush, about twenty years since, he informed] him,
thtat'He then had two letters lringby himnu-nanswered, ashe
could by no means decipher the names of the subscribers."
YVouth sihould he taught that it isi but a poor compliment to
oblige their friends to sit poring over a half written letter,
xiwith difficulty reading one part, and guessing at thle otlher.
which aLt once robs theln of that pleasure and satisfaction.
which naturally arise in the mind -shile readling the lettert
of a friend, written, not only in a good style, but in a fair,

ehirbgraphy has frequettly been the means of introducing

After duly reflecting,; on all the above conlsiderations. and
numerous others, which will iiaittrally- Ie su";el,tecd to the

The facts contained in the following certfijcates, the
author hopes, will be a sufficient apology, 7witlh a
candid public, for their niumber.  He might have
greatly increased the number, but these are thought
to conltain the fullest ecidence of the utility of this
mode of instructio,, and to establish his claim as
the voriginal invreltor.  He has spent the prime of
his life in improving and peTifecting the art;endured nmuch labor andfatigue;--sacrficed nmuch
time and prloperlty, greatly embarrassed himself
and family;--and sofir from   sharing the profits
which have beein 7imade by those, who have taught
on his systemn, he is left under the pressure of the
exlpenses he lhas incurred in the prosecution of

Boston, Feb. 24, 1810.
Having for a number of years past made use of the outlines
of John Jenkins' mode of Pennmanship, I feel it my duty to assure the public, that, in my opinion, a person of proper age
may learn more in two or three weeks, by a strict attention to
those rules, than is usually learned in as many years in the old
way.                                D. H. LEONARD.

AItkinson, Jan. 28, 1811.
As a friend to justice and merit, I certify, that I have examined Mr. John Jenkins' System of Writing, and am fully convinced of its great utility in obtaining a proper and systematical
knowledge of chirography, in a much shorter period than usual.
I also testify, that about eighteen months since Mr. D. H.
Leonard came here, recommended' as an uncommon teacher of
writing. He was employed to instruct the youth in this vicinity
in my house, who made great proficiency in this art, in a short
time. That he was in partnership with a certain Abel Wrifford, and they both taught on the plan, or system, of the abovesaid Jenkins.
From the best information, I am convinced, that the publication of the above described system, would be extensively
useful to the people of our country; and it is earnestly recommended to their attention.

lVarrez,. June 28, 1810.
Fromn an attentive examination and tel years' experience,
lwe do not hesitate to give it as our opinion, that Air. J. Jenkiiis' System of Writing is by far superior to anly that has been
presented to the public, and well calculated, not only to insure
success. but also to save mintch time and expense ill acquiring
this ulsefuil and onlamental brancll of polite edIucation. In justice to Mr. Jenkins we must also observe, that it is likewsise our
opinion, that 11. Dean's Analytical Guide is vastly inferior to
that of Nlr. Jenkins' and that what little it contains, in any
measure calculated to facilitate the art of writing, seems to he
co)pied from Mr. Jenkins' System, whlieb las been in use nearly
twenty years.                    SAMUEL RANDALL,

By receiving six or eight lessons in writing from Mr. J.
Jenkins, I obtained more kno-wledge in penmanship, than in
several years before. I am therefore fully eonvinced that persons, eveni after they have arrived to manhood, may receive
very peculiar advantages from his instructions.
Mr. ELIJAH LORlING.
Boston, Feb. 22, 13182.
T'his certifies, that about fifteen years since, I was instructed in wsriting by Mr. John Jenkins, and received more knowledge
in penmanship from fifteen lessons, given by him in the space
of thirty hours, than I had obtained before in seven years; and
from this knowledge I instructed a child, who was previously
ignorant c f the art; to write a fair hand in fifteen days, and am
confident his system, universally adopted, woulld prove an immense saving both of time and expense; and Mr. Jenkins in
justice ought to receive the profits of his original invention and
indisputable right.                  JOHN P. CLARK.

xxiMRECOMMENDATIONS.
J'ewt  orkl, Dec. 1Y, 1st2.
About seventeen years ago, I was presented with a copy of
Jenkins' System of Penmanship, and, on examining its principles, was at once convinced of its great utility over every other
plan, with which I was acquainted. I have tested its utility
ever since in teaching, and do not hesitate to say, that it is natural and simnple, and better calculated to facilitate the art of
pelnmanshlip, than any other which has come under my observat ion.
It is true, a number of works lhave been published on this
subject, in various parts of the U nited States; hut they all appear toh be mere copies of Mr. Jenkins' book. These outrageous and flagrant plagiarisms have enabled the compilers to
amnass fortunes, while the real author, after having devoted the prime of his life to the completion of his system, is now
almost worn out witll age and infirmity, and languishing in obscnritv. BIit it is hope(l tihat the plhilantlropic, and the patroilisers of learning and the fine arts, will, even at this late
period. recognise the author, and bestow upon him his just rewatrtd.                             ALBERT PICKET,

thereon. On a mature examination of the work, I was fully
convinced of the utility and correctness of the principles on
which Mr. Jenkins had formed his system, and believe it, fronm
nmy own experience, to be the only sure an(d expeditious mode
of teaching the useful art of writing. I do fulrther testify, that
I have examined and compared various works that have been
published by difierent authors since Mr. Jenlkiins' firs' publication, and do fully agree with many gentlemen in the state of
Massachusetts, that %ihatever is excellent or valulable in the methods proposed by these authors to tealch the art of Writing in
a new and more expeditious manner is evidently eopied from
the work of J. Jenkins. From a ftill convielion of the utility
of this system, I sincerely hope an enlightened community will
liberally support and eneourage the publication of this importaut and useful guide to the attainment of tile polite art of lecgant penmanship.

THE subscribers are convinced thatt Mr. John Jenlkins is in

HA VVING examined Mr. J,. Jenkins' system of teaching the
Art of Writing, we are confident, were it introduced into all
our schools, there would be a vast saving both of time and expense, as it is eminently calculated to ensure an elegant hand in
a short time. We have also examined H. Dean's Analytical
Guide, so called, and A. Wrifford's Writing Copies, and, in
xxxiRECOMMENDATIONS.
justiee to the public and to Mr. Jenkins, we must also observe,
that it is our opinion that their works are a great imposition on
the publie, and vastly inferior to that of Mr. Jenkins; and that
what little they contain, in any measure caleulated to fitcilitate
the Art of Writing, appears to be copied fronm Mr. Jenkins'
system, which has been in use nearly twenty years.

JASON PARK,             3of youth.
From the Ree. Jntes.31orse, Rector of the Episcopal Chl-rch..Jbewlcburport, Oct. 8, 811.
CoNVINCtDO of the great importalnce of chirograply, and of
the many advantages, which must arise from a mtode of instructing in this art, by which our youth mar- be enabled to acquire a
habit of writing with ease, elegance and rapidity in a much
shorter time, and at vastly less expelse, than inl the old common method of iinstructing, I would recommend Mr. Jolrhn Jenkius' system, as combining all these qualities in an emiinent degree. His system, being apparently the original, from whsieh
A. WritTord and others have copied, embraces all the improvements, which tile latter have proposed, without the defects attending their mode of instruction. By Mr- Jenkins' method the
pupil is taughlt to iwrite a round, fair, and plain hand, without
those breakilgs of the letters, whieh, on experience and observation, I am convinced are great defects in their mode of teaching;
by which the writing is less legible, and cannot possibly lie used in the comnmon concerns of penmanship with sufficient ease
or rapidity.  It appears in fact, that the fautlts of the latter
arise principally from deviating from Jenkins' original; and
that Mr, Jenkin%s deserves the whole credit of the new and imnprovedl plan of teaching this elegant art upon the most correct
principles and expeditious method, and of course merits the patronae of a liberal community.       JAMNES MORSE.
P. S. I recommend Mr. Jenkinls' plan withl thile more coIn.
fidence from having received instructions from him in his branch
about sixteen years since; and from having also instructed with
success upon his principles.

Beverly, Oct. 23, 1811.
HAVING for about twenty years been acquainted with J.
Jenkins' first book of penmanship, I have not only considerably
improved my own hand, but found it highly useful in teaching
others. And having carefully examined H. Dean's Analytical
Guide, so called, and A. Wrifford's Copies, it is my opinion,
that whatever, in either of them, is either more new or useful
than common, is evidently copied from J. Jenkins' original
work.
I feel confident that if Mr. Jenkins' whole system were introduced into our schools, there would be an immense saving,
both of time and expense; and therefore highly deserving of
general patronage.     ISAAC FLAGG, A. U. Preceptor.
MR. JENKINS, SIR,.Newport, Jdug. 27, 1810.
HAVING learned to write from your system, and also having
taught from its principles with great success for a number of
years, I do most cheerfully recommend your plan of instruction
to the public, as deserving the most liberal encouragement.
LEVI TOWER, Preceptor of JXewport Jcademy,
MR. JENRKINS, SIR,        Xezwport, u.ug. 28, 1810.
You have my entire approbation of your plan of writing.
Your analysis of the letters of the alphabet, and specimens of
the progress and completion of the art, combine, with the accuracy of mechanism and proof of demonstration, the amusement of drawing; and are peculiarly adapted to exercise
the ingenuity and improve the taste of the young, and lead
them to pursue as a pleasure, what has commonly been performed as a task.-With my wishes for your success by a liberal subscription,      I am your friend,

To the friends of scientce, jutstice, and nmerit.
Warehouse Point, Feb. 23, 113s.
HAVING examined Jenkins' plain and easy system of acquiring the art of writing, I am fully convinced, that he is the.
real discoverer of that which is generally ascribed to A. Wrifford. As I am acquainted with Wrifford's copies, and have
compared them with Jenkins' book, published in 1791, I am
convinced that Wrifford obtained his skill and fame as a teacher of the art of writing from that book, that he has been guilty
of atrocious plagiarism, that he has made no improvement on
Jenkins' system, and that he has altered niothing for the better,
but many things for the worse.
I sincerely wish that Jenkins' whole system may come into
universal use, not only for the good of the indefatigable author,
but for the immense benefit of the public.
Rev. NATHANIEL HUSE.
Farmington, Jan. 12, 1813.
From an examination of Mr. Jenkins' plain and easy system
of the art of writing, I am satisfied that it promises the highest
utility, and that a set of the books, which he proposes to publish, would assist any single person in the art of penmanship,
far more than the lessons given by Dean, Towne, Wrifford, and
others, who have professed to lead their pupils to a speedy acquaintance with the art. It appears that Mr. Jenkins is the
original author of the rules, which these gentlemen have adopted and taught with so much success to their pupils, and to
their own great emolument; while he has himself been endeavouring to perfect the system and prepare it for publication.

TimE subseriber, having been taught by A. Wrifford his system of wsriting, improperly so called anl lhaving lately had ani
opportulnity crit ically to examiine Mr. Jenkins' system (cf writing,
and eompared the same with that published and taught by A.
Wriford, (teems it a duty he owes to the publle and Mr. Jenkins, to deelare his conviction, that A. Wrifford has purloined
and( adopted every importanit and essential principle of Mr.
Jenkins' system, an(d that his deviations have been made apparently to evade the direct chargem of plagiarism, and are in their
tendency ealculated to prevent the acquirement of a free aind
easy style of writing.
Much experience and investigatiou of the essential principles of the Art of Writing induces him to acknowledge, that
Mr. Jenkins' mode possesses an infinite supelority over that
taught bhy A. Wrifford, both in taste and substantial advantage
to the pupil.
The above is in justice to an injured and deserving man,

ADDRESS
TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS.
I'ilcosE parents and guardians, who consider that
lhealth is one of thle greatest of temporal blessings, and
v1who duly estimate the advantages of a good education,
will doubtless cheerfully encourage the publication of
anf easy and expeditious mo(le of acquiring the art of
writing. The planl of this work is such, tlhat not only
tlhe robust anl lhealtlly may be freed from long and
painful confinement in school; but thousands of children, who are of a slender and weakly constitution, or
th!ose who lhave not the advantages of attending common
sclhools, by using a set of these books, may learn to
write at home; whereas, in the usual mode of instructionl cllildren often write for months, with very little improvement-thieir minds must necessarily become tired,
if not disgusted, with a continual sameness. Thus many
despair of ever acquirilng  a handsome hand, and neglect writing at all, or content themselves with barely
coniveying their ideas in a rough and homely dress.
For waint of an easy system, comprising simple rules
andl examples, which children can see and understand,
year after year, and vast sums of money are spent to
little purpose. Tllhousands, who have natulrally a taste
for fine writing, after all tleir pains and loss of time,
write but miserably. This failure arises not from wantTO() PARENTS AN'ID GUARDIANS.
of capacity, or fi'om any natural defect in their organs:
but from tile want of such a system, as should awaken
their curiosity, and interest their feelings;-such a svstelcn as should insure tlhen some improvement at every
step, should excite thllir emulation, produce patience
anld perseverance, and speedily enable them to write
\vith facility and elegance. Instead of this, it is much tot
be lameIinted, that in the common mode of instruction, by
far the greater nulmber of children arle furnished with
but ordinary colties; alnd being seated at a distance
froni thl teacher, widlout rules, ainId w\%ith but little if
-Iidy assistance, thley are left to trudge on, year after
year, amlidst innlumerable discouragemelnts, and by the
imere dlint of iteil o-wn genius, t'o acqluire one of thle
ltiiest an(Id most usefiul arts, of which, indeed, but few
teacliers themselves are master's.
It is o)bvious to all, that chtillhIen have a natural
propelnsity for dlrawing-a fontldness for imitating witl
a pen or p)encil any thingl which strikes their mlindls as
bein curious or beautiful.  This is evident from their
volulntary attempits to draw trees, flowers, birds. &amp;c.'Now as " a hanlldsome piece of writing is a speaking
ictiture" whllich immniediately pleases tevery belholder,
tile inclination of children, jlust menlltioed, lmay be
turned(t to til: best tadvantnge in teaclilng the art of
writing.''The plan of this work is calculated to cherislh a1nd improve this inclination.  The rules are so
ldain and easy. that the pupil wvill advance with rapidity:-every ntew lesson wvill give him adlditional lleaslitre andl promplt him to furtlhert exertion.  The followinu blooks are reduced to such lessons, that the learner
nlay every hour perceive his own improvement. and by
practice will be gradually led from the first lrinciples,
to a correct formation of the letters, andl to tleir (ifferent com-binationls in joining hand.  Thus, instead of
colnfining children to writing as a tedious and laborious
task, tllhey may acquire the art of writilng merely by
way of amusement, as well as save a vast portion of
time for improvement ia various other branches of use.

ful science.  And what call be nmore gratifying to parents. than to see this elegant and useful brancll of eduication acquired by their clilldren witli so little expense,
anid in so shllort a time?
It is much to be regaretted that it has become of
late years in a degree fashionable to write a scrawling
and almost unintelligible hand.  Letters of business
or friendship are too often written in this way.  BIut
to write in suchi a manner might seem to discover a want
of taste, andil little respect for those to whom w%ve write.
Why should noIlt this be tloultghlt as r1'eal a (leict, aS to
read( or spell erroneollsly, or to speak ungralnmatiely?
It is certainly desirablle that letters sllhoul(l be so written that they may p)lease, not only by their sentiments,
but also by the legibility and clcglance of the lhandwritin g.
But it is of still more importance in mercantile
anid all pullic lbusiness, that writing sho11ull bIe eSxcteited in a failr hand.  1Boo(k accounts, bon1)l(s, (Ile(ls,
lnotes, &amp;c. very much dependt oil tile l,.iliility of the.
i Nriting, and often on a single letter.
In view of thlese thinigs it is evidently of great conlseqtuence that exertions shouldl Ibe made to Iprevent tile
furlther prevalence of a careless and bad hal)it in writillg.
As soon as child(ren have regularly gone tlirotlirh,
ant sufficiently practised the lessons of large,joining-'han(l copies, and have enltere(l upon the lessons of thel
small or running, hand, it would greatly tend to their
advantage to be provided with a bIlank book, ruled fi r
tihe purpose, in which they should, at their leisure, or
by way of amusement, be instructed to transcribe in a
fair an(d neat hand such miscellaneouls pieces and select
sentences in prose or verse as the parents or teachers
mnay direct.
In this book, also, may b1e noted down various instructions of the parents, and particular ruiles of duty
to be observed by children.  The text on Sabblath

ART OF WRITING.
Ix every art and science there are certain first andi(
fixe(d principles, which are as a fo,unldation upon whichll
the whole is built. The rilght iunderstaniding of thesu
is alsollutely necessary, that we may become masters
of tlhe art which we undertake to learn.  And a
neglect of tllese in learning to write, is the only reason
lhy man, whlo have spent time sufficient to lhave
been accomplished writers, are, after all, incapable
of writing a legible hand, and are thereby, in a great
measure, disqualified for the service of the public;
or even to transact private business with propriety.
IMy first oblject, therefore, in my schools, has
generally been to teach the learner to draw the principal strokes singly, with a ldegree of accuracy, before
lie has been allowed to make letters composed of
tw-o strokes: By this method I have lhad the great
pleasure of seeing the art of writing acquired in less
than one fourth of thle time usually consumed in the
common way. This is certainly a matter of great
and lasting importance, both to parents and children.
It will be easily admitted, that writing is gained
by imitation, rather tha# by reasoning; a little atten74              AW }.RT 0 F W RIITINI i.
tio!! will also convilnce any one, that nearly all the letters, Iothll great alnl small, are made by tile (lifterent
combinations of a few leadini   strokes.  Hlence may
I)e seen tile necessity of learners havin  well imprlessed oIi ttheir mil(Is at first, a clear alld (listiiiet idea
of the prinicipl)l strokes; for as the peni must follow
the mind of a writer, a just idea of the best formed
cllatlacters oughlt to lbe well implre,ssedl   olt the mind,l
tllat they may!be ilstanltly realdy to (lrop) fr(oml thle Ien
when calletd for.  A nteglect of thlis is tile realsolln w\htly
so many lnmonltls, and even years, alre, with many,
but lidtle better tllhanl tlhriownl away.
The'refore, sinlce the letters of the alphabet are
formledl I)y the (lifflclrent combinatiotls of a few principal strokes, it must at once appear evident to every
(liseernllint  minld, that pupils shouldl:l  at first be taught
to tlraw  these strokes separately, until they lhave

able al t ()oce to dliscernc.  where the pen ouwllt to have
been carried ligllter, or pressetl  iardtlel, ill orlder to

From the reason and lnature of tlings, it appears
as niecessary that learners shlould be well instructed
in the manner of (Irawvinig the first or leading strokes.
in order soon to become masters of this art. as that
they shoulldl be taught to know andl sound the letters
of the alphablet, before they are set to reading vlordl
of five or six syllables.
Another great defect in teaching this art is. a
neglect of a proper standartd for imitation.  People
in genleral are not thoroughly sOnsible of the greatARtT OF WRITING.
inconvellience arising firom  the imitation of a bad
hand: or of the slow   I)orogress n which is madel in
consequence of being tauglht l)y a succession of masters n ho write a diversity of liandls. It is tiherefore of
tihe first importance, especially where there is a fre(uent change of mmasters, to lhave some regular, tixec
stan(lard, w lleelry to attain the Art, of Wlritimll: so
that, evlen tllhoughl the teacnll' slion(mid nolt write an

improv\ing, and lnot lose so great a proportionll of that
short pittaxnce of timne whlicl is allottell to thousands
of our youth for the acquisition of this art.  All lre

to initate, in writing, one and the same standard, we
shall sooIn perceive the agreeab)le effect of tlhat larmony and similarity whlicih will be the natural consequence.
Those logicians reason backwards, who tell jus,
it is best for clildren at first to have a poor copy for
imitation, lest they be discouraged; they do not
consider that this method not only at once cramps a
child's genius, and consequlently is the dlirect way

3ART OF WRITING.'to Aistourage him, (as such ungraceful copies are
not suflicient to keep hlis attention awake) but that
it will take as long, if not longer, exactly to imitate
a bad hand, as it would a good ole.
Thlere are three very great disadvantaes wh-lich
naturally arise from not having the best of copies for
imitation at first beginning to write.  1st, There is
a great loss of time. 2dly, There is also a great
Waste of money; and this is not the worst; for 31dly,
Bad habits must of necessity be contractedl; for
while a cihild lhas before lim a very imperfect copy
for imitation, he is not only lalboring to impress his
mind with quite a wrong idea of a letter bult he
likewise habituates himself to a Nwrong motion of thle
fingers, and plressure of the pen. in (llawing this
letter; and these halbits are corrected afterwards
with great difficulty. if ever, as must be acknowIcldged by all wh11o cosider the force of custom; it
heine; mulch hairder to correct a bad habit, than to
acquire a good one at first.
Now, since it must cost unwearied labor, both
for the teacher atnd learner. to rid the mind from a
wrong idea of a letter, as well as to acquire the right
motion of the fingers and pressure of the pen, wlhat
a pity it is that (so much time and other expenses
should be throwii away. only to acquire a bad habit
of writing, when a hancdsonle hand, by proceeding
in a regular met hod. niay be learned in a much
shorter time, and witil less expense.

he attended to, that any one may soon become master
of this art.
The first is, to get a perfect idea of each priltcipal
stroke well impressed on the mind.
The second is, to acquire the right motion of the
fingers, or pressure of the pen, in order to draw
these strokes upon the paper; both of whichl may
soon be acquired by a careful use of the dry pen,
of whichi more will be said hlereafter.
iMy present design is, in the most easy and familiar malnner, at once to give the learner filly to
understand the ground work of this art, and at the
same time to describe the most legible and suitable
characters of the best plates now in use.
I have therefore in the following work dissected
thle letters, placing thle six principal strokes by
themselves, that the learner may draw them accurately, before he proceeds to form letters; as soon
as he is able to do this, he will go on to write with
great ease-because twenty-five of the small letters,
and several of thle capitals, are made by the different combinations of these principal strokes, withi
but a little variation or addition. It is therefore the
ilnterest of the learner to pay his first attention to
these strokes, which are exceedingly simple, considered separately, their likeness one to anothler, and
their dependance on each other, as may be plainly
seen and easily understood, by attending to the
rollowing explanations.uld observations.If any slloulli obj ect againlst tlle  being placedl

and fore and mi(ddle fingers, with the scoop) or hollow of the pen directly toward the breast. The pen
will then be il a proper position to be received into
the right hand. Then,

first put the ball of his middle finger directly on the
right side of the pen at the upper part of the scoop;
then lay Whis forefiniger on the back of the pen so as tQ

outAward, raising tile end as high as tile first joillt of
thle middle fingoer-taking care to hide tlhe g;reater
part of the ball under the penu. Thnts let the pen be
heldl, lightly and easily, without the least griping of
the pen or contracting of the fingers.
4. Let him turtl Ihis hand well over to the left, so
tlhat the pen may ranle over te righlit stlholder near
the neck, in this position resting  tlhe handl on the inside of thle wrist and the ends of the tlir(d andI foturthl
fin,gers; taking- care to keep the elbow wtithin an inch
or two of thie body.  Thle pen )being heild thius, both
parts of the nib will bear equally on the pall)r. The
plupil may now remain in tli's situation for three or
folulr minutes; the teacher. in the meant1 time, remninidin g him to notice every ipm'tictllar respecting the positioln of hils hody, his arms his lingers, andl pen.

that only the riglit side of thie nil) will touch thie paper.  This is to be done ont purpose to make hinm see
and know that it is a wrong position. As thl learner
is ver napt to get a habit of writin in thii awkw-ard
manner, it will be imlportant plainly to show lhim,
that if the pen be hleld tllitus, it will occasion unevenness annd spattering, and relnder it mucli more dtifflcult to learn to w-rite titan if the pen be held properly.

OF THE PROPORTION OF THE
LE TTERS.
As thle beauty and perfection of a piece of writing is much enhanced by the due proportion of thle
letters, it is necessary this proportion should be
mna(te familiar to twhe pupil as soon as possible; for
whelln he is made to discern the regular and uniform
symmetry of a letter, his mind is at once captivated
withla a desire to excel in thlis usefill accomplishment,
andtl what othlerwise woul(i be deemed an irksome
task, is now performed with plearsure; and as the
six prineipal strokes are mathematically a(djusted to
each other, the followinm tlialocle is calculated not
ollly to impress the minld more thoomughly with thle
forte,-oing pvriliciples, blut also to lead to a full unlderstandlilln of tlhe ust land uniform proportion of thle
letters, wllwlh wvill soon become familiar by practice
on0 the following bhooks.
1. q. What do we mneau by the proportion of
letters?
J/. Whlen letters are drawn (of a proper height
and wildth, aind the stents1 of which they are fornmed
are also of a proper width, the letters arc properly
proportioned.
2. Q. At what height ought letters to be drawn?
Ai. Tile letters may be drawn larger or smaller.
as fancy may dictate; yet a common copy hand
oughllt, to be three ei;ghtlls of an inch high.

4. Q. What is the proportionable width of an n
three eighths high.
A.. Its width is two tllirds its perpendicular
heighlt; that is, it is three eighths high, and itB
width, including the stems, two eighths.*
5. Q. Whlat is tile proper width of each of the
stems of the n..i. One sixth part of the whole width.
6. Q. How may this proportion be ascertained?.. D)ivide the width into siX equal partsat two
parts is the widtlh of the stems, and four parts is the
inuward width of n.
7. Q. Are the stems of the othler letters to be
drawn of the same width as the stems of the n?
A.. Yes.
8. Q. What is the proper width of the swell of
lihe o c, e and x?
J. The wide.st part of tile swell is of the same
wtidth of thle stems of the other letters.
9. Q. At what height are the stems of the b, d4
h, k and I drawn above the body of the letters?.A. The height of the n; and it is to be observed
that the stems of tile p, q andf, when not looped, are
drawn the same length below the body of the letters,
and the stems of the j, g, y, long f and f, whea
looped, may be drawn about one third longer.
* In small, or running hand, the letters are wider in pro,
portion to their heiwgit, and the stems are'drawn longer.
t If any prefer a lighter hand, divide the width of n into
-ceven equtal parts, thus will your stems be one sixth part narFrOvier.l0. q. Whiy i's n called the, inesure letter?1./1. Because thie parts of many of thte letter-s are
drawn of thte same wvidthi;* as the h, m, p), &amp;c. as
may easily be seeni in the plate. Al-so becauise the
equal parts of the i'nward width of nt form the distance
between all the letters, ini thte eonstruction of a senitence, as is more fully explainied in the following
dialogule.
11. qI. Whiat lines are used to assist the learnier
in drlrwingr anid propmrtioning- his letter-s when writingr a coIpy hand?
J~. Four full lines and a (lotted one, all drawni
hiorizonitally.
12u. q. How are thtese four full Ilines distinguished?
Al. By first, seconid, th~it'ld and finith.
13. Q. Whiat is thieir different use?
A. The first, or upper Iline, hounds the heighlt of
the stems of b, d, hi, k anid l. Thte seeond h)ounids
the hieighit of thie body of thie letters. The thiritd is
that oni whichl the body of thte letters is footed. The
fourth'is that oni whiceh the stems of the p, q and f
whlen niot looped9 are footed.
14. Q?. Whtat is the use of the dottodI line?
A. It hounds tie, stems of j, g, longr-f andj
when looped, at the bottom.
As the o) has buit one full stroke, its inward widthi is nearly
one sixth greater thani that of n, which has two full strokest.
Thle o, whent drawn to form the a, d, g and q, may be one half
the width or the stem narrower.
