in withdrawing some passages from  their orignal connexion, and bringing
others into immediate contain which were originally separate, and in connecting them by a phrase or a htie of my own--ny answer is, first, that I have in
no instance wantonly sacnficed or maimpd the beautiful ot'spring of their
imagination; and, secondly, my reason, for the violence that in any case has
been offered them, was miy wish to crowd as many of them as I could into the
narrow space within which I am restricted, and so to group them that they
might do all possible good in their present service, and thus reflect all possible
honor upon their parents.-When I have been compelled to amputate, I
have conscientir osly endeavored to retrench only "those members of the
body which seemed to be more feeble," that upon the others might be bestowed
the "'more abundant honor."  If I have broken off the legs and arms of the
Farnese Hercules, it was that I might the better display " the breadth of his
shoulders, alld the spaciousness of his chest."
Without attempting to furnish schools with what might be denominated a
pronouncing reader, I have, in many instances, indicated the proper pronunciation, either by such accents, attached to the words in the text as are generally understood, or, where these accents were insufficient, by a note at the
foot of the page. This has been done only in words of which a vicious pronunciation has obtained in some parts of the country, and even these I have
not uniformly or constantly marked  supposing it sufficient to have called the
attention of teachers, once or twice, to any particular word. When the pronlutciation of an English word is given, it is that of Walker. In orthography,
the same standard has been followed, with perhaps one or two deviations upon
the authority of Johnson.
In regard to errata, whether in respect to the real words of the author, the
spelling, or the punctuation, it is hoped that there will be no great cause of
complaint. In many instances, in the lessons from Shakspeare especially, I
have restored the genuine reading of the author, which has been corrupted in
mnany other compilations.  The punctuatioii too, which when incorrect, so
constantly misleads the learner, and embarrasses the learned, has been an
object of assiduous care. Should any one be curious to compare particular
pieces in this compilation, especially those from Shakspeare, with the same
in other school-books, he will probably feel that it is but just, before condemning this for differing from them, either in the reading or the punctuation,
to refer to some good edition of the author, for satisfaction as to his words
and then, by a careful comparison of the different modes of poiniting, to judge
which of them best discovers his meaning.
Sach as I have been able to matke the book, in respect to its arrangement,
accuracy, and general character, it goes forth into the world without any letters of recommendation. The truth is, I have asked none for it. If it is a
good book, the public understands its own interests too well to let it die. If
it is not a good one, no recommendations can keep it alive. I have made it,
in the hope that it might be an acceptable offering to schools, especially those
of this city, in which there are many children who are the objects of my pastoral care. In regard to them, and the young in general, the book will fulfil
my hopes, if, uhile it helps them on towards the end of their scholastic labors-the general improvement of their minds,-it shall enable them better
to understand and discharge their duties in life, and lead them to contemplate
with pleasure and religious reverence, the c'laracter of the Great Author of
their being, as discovered in his works, his providence, and his word; and
thus help them to attain the end of their Christian faith,-the salvation of
their souls.

PREFACE.Lines written during a thunder storm.-DMITRIEV.*
IT thunders! Sons of dust, in reverence bow!
Ancient of days! Tl'hou speakest from above:
Thy right hand wields the bolt of terror now;
That band which scatters peace and joy and love
Almighty! trembling like a timid child,
I hear thy awful voice--alarmed--afraidI see the flashes of thy lighltning wild,
And in the very grave would hide my head.
Lord! what is man? Up to the sun he fliesOr feebly wanders through earth's vale of dust:
Thlere is he lost'midst heaven's high mysteries,
And here in error and in darkness lost:
Beneath the storm-clouds, on life's raging sea,
Like a poor sailor-by the tempest tost
In a frail bark-the sport of destiny,
He sleeps-and dashes on the rocky coast.
Thou breathest;-and the obedient storm is still:
Thou speakest;-silent tne submissive wave:
Man's shattered ship the rushing waters fill,
And the hush'd billows roll across his grave.
Sourceless and endless God! compared with Thee,
Life is a shadowy, momentary dream:
And time when viewed thro-ugh Thy eternity,
Less than the mote of morning's golden beam.
LESSON XXXIX.
Interview between TWaverley and Fergus Mac-Ivor, at Carlisle,
previous to the execution of the latter.-SCcTT.
AFTER a sleepless night, the first dawn of morning found
Waverley on the esplanade in front of the old Gothic gate
of Carlisle castle.  But he paced it long in every direction
before the hour when, according to the rules of the garrison, the gates were opened, and the drawbridge lowered.
He produced his order to the sergeant of the guard, and was
admitted.  The place of Fergus's confinement was a gloomy

[Lesson 39.and vaulted apartment in the central part of the castle; a
huge old tower, supposed to be of great antiquity, and surrounded by outworks, seemingly of Henry VIII's time, or
somewhat later. The grating of the huge old-fashioned
bars and bolts, withdrawn for the purpose of admitting Edward, was answered by the clash of chains, as the unfortunate chieftain, strongly and heavily fettered, shuffled
along the stone floor of his prison, to fling himself into his
friend's arms.'"My dear Edward," he said, in a firm and even cheerful
voice, "this is truly kind. I heard of your approaching
happiness with the highest pleasure; and how does Rose?
and how is our old whimsical friend the Baron  Well, I
am sure, from your looks-and how will you settle prece'dence between the three ermines passant, and the bear and
boot-jack?"" "How, O how, my dear Fergus, can you talk
of such things at such a moment?"-" Why, we have entered Carlisle with happier auspices, to be sure-on the
16th of November last, for example, when we marched in,
side by side, and hoisted the white flag on these ancient
towers.  But I am no boy, to sit down and weep because
the luck has gone against me. I knew the stake which I
risked; we played the game boldly, and the forfeit shall be
paid manfully.
"You are rich," he continued, "Waverley, and you are
generous; when you hear of these poor Mac-Ivors being
distressed about their miserable possessions by some harsh
overseer or agent of government, remember you have warn
their tartan, and are an adopted son of their race.  The
Baron, who knows our manners, and lives near our country,
will apprize you of the time and means to be their protector. Will you promise this to the last Vich Ian Vohr?"Edward, as may vwell be believed, pledged his word; which
afterwards he so amply redeemed, that his memory still
lives in these glens by the name of the Friend of the Sons
of Ivor.-" Would to God," continued  the chieftain, "I
could bequeath to you my rights to the love and obedience
of this primitive and brave race: or at least, as I have striven to do, persuade poor Evan to accept of his life upon their
terms; and be to you what he has been to me, the kindest
-tlie bravest-the most devoted    "
The tears which his own fate could not draw forth, fell
fast for that of his foster-brother.  " But," said he, drying
them, "that cannot be. You cannot be to them  Vich Iaai

97Vohr; and these three magic words," said he, half smiling,'are the only Open Sesam}e to their feelings and sympathies; and poor Evan must attend his foster-brother in death,
as he has done through his wvhole life."-" And I am  sure,"
said Maccombich, raising himself from the floor, on whicll,
for fear of interrupting  their conversation, he had lain so
still, that in the obscurity of the apartment, Edward was
not aware of his presence,-- "I am  sure Evan never desired nor deserved a better end then just to die with his
chieftain."
A tap at the door now announced the arrival of the priest;
and Edward retired while he administered to both prisoners
the last rites of religion, in the mode which the church of
Rome prescribes.  In about an hoar he was readmittedI
Soon after, a file of soldiers entered with a blacksmith, who
struck the fetters from  the legs of the prisoners.  "You
see the compliment they pay to our Highland strength and
courage; we have lain chained here like wild beasts, till
our legs are cramnped into palsy; and when they free us,
they send six soldiers with loaded mruskets' to prevent our
taking the castle by storm."
Shortly after, the drums of the garrison beat to arms.
"This is the last turn out," said Fergus, " that I shall hear
and obey.  And now, my dear, dear Edward, ere we part,
let us speak of Flora,-a subject which awakes the tenderest feeling that yet thrills within me."-" We part not
here?" said XWTaverley.  " O yes, we do, you must come no
farther.  Not that I fear what is to follow for myself," he
said proudly; "nature has her tortures as well as art, and
how happy should we think the man who escapes from  the
throes of a mortal and painful disorder in the space of a
shlort half hour! And this matter, spin it out an they will,
cannot last long-er.  But what a dying man can suffer firmly, may kill a living friend to look upon.
"This same law of high treason," he continued, with astonishing firmn-ess and composure, " is ojne of the blessings,
Edward, with which your free country has accommodated
poor old Scotland: her own jurisprudence, as I have heard,
was much milder. B13t I suppose, one day or other, when
there are no longer any  wild Highlanders to benefit by its
tender mercies, they will blot it from their records, as levelling them with a nation of cannibals.  The mummery too,
of exposing the senseless head! they have not the wit to
grace mine  with a piaper coronet; there would be some.

THE AMERICANsa'tire in that, Edward.  I hope they will set it on the Scotch
gate though, that I may look, even after death, to the blue
hills of my own country, that I love so dearly!"
A bustle, and the sound of wheels and horses' feet, was
now heard in the court-yard of the castle.-An officer appeared, and intimated that the high sheriff and his attendants
waited before the gate of the castle, to claim the bodies of
Fergus AMac-Ivor and Evan Maccoinbich: " I come," said
Fergus. Accordingly, supporting Edward by the arm, and
followed by Evan Dhu and the priest, he moved down the
stairs of the tower, the soldiers bringing up the rear. The
court was occupied by a squadron of dragoons and a battalion of infantry, drawn up in a hollow square.
Within their ranks was the sledge or hurdle, on which the
prisoners wWre to be drawn to the place of execution, about
a mile distant from Carlisle. It was painted blackc, and
drawn by a white horse. At one end of the vehicle sat the
executioner, a horrid looking fellow, as beseemed his trade,
with the broad axe in his hand; at the other end, next the
horse, was an empty seat for two persons.  Through the
deep and dark Gothic archway that opened on the drawbridge, were seen on horseback the high sheriff and his attendants, whom the etiquette* betwixt the civil and military
power did not permit to come farther.
"This is well GOT UP for a closing scene," said Fergus,
smiling disdainfully as he gazed around upon the apparatus
of terror. Evan Dhu exclaimed with some eagerness, after
looking at the dragoons, " These are the very chields that
gallopped off at Gladsmuir ere we could kill a dozen of
them. They look bold enough now, however."  The priest
entreated him to be silent.
The sledge now approached, and Fergus turning round
embraced Waverley, kissed him  on each side of the face,
and stepped nimbly into his place. Evan sat down by his
side. The priest w-vas to follow in a carriage belonging to
his patron, the Catholic gentleman at whose lhouse Flora
resided. As Fergus waved his hand to Edward, the ranks
closed around the sledge, and the whole procession began
to move forward.
There was a momentary stop at the gateway, while the
governor of the castle and the high sheriff went through a
short ceremony, the military officer there delivering over
the persons of the criminals to the civil power. "God save
King George!" said the high sheriff. When the formality

Lesson 39.1concluded, Fergus stood erect in the sledge, and with a finn
and steady voice replied, " God save King James!"  These
were the last words which Waverley heard him speak.
The procession resumed its march, and the sledge vanished forrlm beneath the portal, under which it had stopped
for an instant.  The dead march, as it is called, was instantly heard; apd its meldancholy sounds were mingled.

Egyptian Mummies, Tombs, and M41anners.-BELZONI.

the foot of the Lybian mountains, on the west of Thebes,

ITHE AMERICANform of large and of small chambers, each of which has its
separate entrance; and, though they are very close to each
other, it is seldom  that there is any interior communication from  one to another.  I canll truly say, it.is imnpossible to give any description sufficient to convey the smallest
idea of those subterranean abodes and their inhabitants.
There are no sepulchres in any part of the world like thlem;
there are no excavations, or mines, that can be compared to
these truly astonishing places; and no exact description can
be given of their interior, owing to the difficulty of visiting these recesses.  The inconveniency of entering into
them  is such, that it is not every one who can support the
oxertion.
A  traveller is generally satisfied when he has seen the
large hall, the gallery, the staircase, and as far as he can
conveniently go: besides, he is taken  up with the strange
-Works lhe observes cut in various places, and painted on each
side of the walls; so that when he comes to a narrow and
difficult passage, or a descent to the bottom of a well or
cavity, he declines taking such trouble. naturally supposing that he cannot see in these abysses ny thing so'magnificent as what he sees above, and con'*quently deeming
it useless to proceed any farther.
Of some of these tombs many persons could not withstand
the suffocating air, which often causes fainting.  A vast quantity of dust rises, so fine that it enters into the throat and
nostrils, and chokes the nose and mouth to such a degree,
that it requires great power of lungs to resist it, and the
strong effluvia of the mummies. This is not all; the entry
or passage where the bodies are, is roughly cut in the rocks,
and the falling of the sand from the upper part or ceiling of
the passage causes it to be nearly filled up. In somne places
there is not more than a vacancy of a foot left, wVhich you
must contrive to pass through in a creeping posture like a
snail, on pointed and keen stones, that cut like glass.
After getting through tlese passages, some of them  two
or three hundred yards long, you generally find a more commodious place, perhaps hiogh enough to sit.  But what a place
of rest! surrounded by bodies, by heaps of mumamies in all
directions; which, previous to my being accustomed to the
sight, impressed me with horror.  The blackness of the wall,
the faint light given by the candles or torches for want of
air, the different objects that surrounded me, seeming to
converse with eachl other, and the Arabs with the candles or

selves resembling living mummies, absolutely formned a scene
that cannot be described. In such a situation I found myself several times, and often returned exhausted and fainting, till at last I became inured to it, and indifferent to what
I suffered, except from the dust, which never failed to choke
my throat and nose; and though, fortunately, I am  destitute of the sense of smelling, I could taste that the mummies were rather unpleasant to swallow.
After the exertion of entering into such a place, through
a passage of fifty, a hundred, three hundred, or perhaps six
hundred yards, nearly overcome, I sought a resting-place,
found one, and contrived to sit; but when m-y weight bore
on the body of an Egyptian, it crushed like a band-box. I
naturally lhad recourse to my hands to sustain my weight,
but they found no better support; so that I sank altogether
among the broken mummies, with a crash of bones, rags,
and wooden cases, which raised such a dust as kept me motionless for a quarter of an hour, waiting till it subsided
again. I could not remove from the place, however, without increasing it, and every step I took I crushed a mummy
in some part or other.
Once I was conducted from  such. a place to another resembling it, through a passage of about twenty feet in
length, and no wider than what a body could be forced
through. It was choked with mummies, and I could not
pass without putting my face in contact with that of some
decayed Egyptian; but as the passage inclined downwards,
my own weight helped me on; however, I could not avoid
being covered with bones, legs, arms, and heads, rolling
from above. Thus I proceeded from one cave to another,
all full of mummies piled up in various -ways, some standing,
some lying, and some on their heads.
The purpose of my researches was to rob the Egyptians
of their papyri; of which I found a few hidden in their
breasts under their arms, in the space above the knees, or
on the legs, and covered by the numerous folds of cloth that
efivelop the mummy.  The people of Gournou, who make
a trade of antiquities of this sort, are very jealous of'strailgers, and keep them as secret as possible; deceiving travellers, by pretending that they have arrived at the ernd of the
pits, when they are scarcely at the entrance. *::
I must not omit, that among these tombs we saw-some
which contained the mummies of animals intermixed with

human bodies. There were balls, cows, sheep, monkeys,
foxes, bats, crocodiles, fishes, and birds in them: idols oftell
occur; and onle tomb was filled with nothing but cats, carefully folded in red and white linen, the head covered by a
mask representing the cat, and mad&amp;e of the same linen. I
have opened all these sorts of animals.  Of the bull, the
calf, and the sheep, there is no part but the head which is
covered with linen, and the horns project out of the cloth'
the rest of the body being represented by two pieces of
wood, eighteen inches wide, and three feet long, in a horizontal direction, at the end of which was another, placed
perpendicularly, two feet high, to form the breast of the
animal.  The calves and sheep are of the same structure,
and large in proportion to the bulls.  The monkey is in its
full form, in a sitting posture. The fox is squeezed up by
the bandages, but in some measure the shape of the head is
kept perfect. The crocodile is left in its own shape, and
after being well bound round with linen, the eyes and mouth
are painted on this covering.  The birds are squeezed together, and lose their shape, except the ibis, which is found
like a fowl ready to be cooked, and bound round with linen
like all the rest. * x *
The next sort of mummy that drew my attention, I believe I may with reason conclude to have been appropriated
to the priests. They are folded in a manner totally different from the others, and so carefully executed, as to show
the great respect paid to those personages.  The bandages
are stripes of red and white linen intermixed, covering the
whole body, and producing a curious effect from  the two
colors.  The arms and legs are not enclosed in the samne
envelope with the body, as in the common mode, but are
bandaged separately, even the fingers and toes being preserved distinct.  They have sandals of painted leather on
their feec, and bracelets on their arms and wrists. They
are always found with the arms across the breast, but not
pressing it; and though the body is bouind with such a quantity of linen, the shape of the person is carefully preserved
in every limb. The cases in which mummies of this sort
are found, are somewhat better executed, and I have seen
one that had the eyes and eyebrows of enamel, beautifully
executed in imitation of nature. *  *x x
The dweiling-place of the natives is generally in the passages, between the first and second entrance into a tomb.
The walls and the roof are as black as any chimney.  Theinner door is closed up with mud, except a small ap'erture
sufficient for a man to crawl through.  Within this place the
sheep are kept at night, and occasionally accompany their
masters in their vocal concert.  Over ther door-way there
are always some half-broken Egyptian figures, and the two
foxes, the usual guardians of burial-places. A small lamp,
kept alive by fat from the sheep, or rancid oil, is placed in
a niche in the wall, and a mat is spread on the ground; and
this formed the grand divan' wherever I was.
There the people assembled round me, their conversation
turning wholly on antiquities. Such a one had found such
a thing, and another had discovered a tomb. Various articles
were brought to sell to me, and sometimes ~I -hacl reason torejoice at having stayed there.  I was sure of a supper of
milk and bread served in a wooden bowl; but whenever
they supposed I should stay all night, they always killed a
couple of fowls for me, which were balced in a small oven
heated with pieces of mummy cases, and sometimes with
the bones and rags of the mumrmies them.selves. It is no
uncommon thing to sit down near fragments of bones: hands,
feet, or skulls, are often in the way; for these people are
so accustomed to be among the mummies, that they think
no more of sitting on them than on the skins of their dead
calves. I also became indifferent about them at last, and
would have slept in a mummy pit as readily as out of it.
Here they appear to be contented. The laborer comes
home in the evening, seats himself near his cave, smokes
his pipe with his companions, and talks of the last inundation of,the Nile, its products, and what the ensuing season
is likely to be. His old wife brings him  the usual bowl of
lentils and bread moistened with water and salt, and (wh;en
she can add a little butter) it is a feast. Knowing nothing
beyond this, he is happy. The young man's chief business
is to accumulate the amazing sum of a hundred piastres
(eleven dollars and ten cents,) to buy himself a wife, and to
make a feast on the wedding-day.
If he have any children, they want no clothing: he leaves
them to themselves till mother Nature pleases to teach them
to work, to gain money enough to buy a shirt or some other
rag to cover themselves; for while they are children they
are generally naked or covered with rags.  The parents
are roguishly cunning, and the children are schooled by
their example, so that it becomres a matter of course to
cheat strangers. WVould any one believe that, in such a
[Lesson 40,
104
THE AMERICANstate of life, luxury and ambition exist? If any woman be
destitute of jewels, she is poor, and looks with envy on one
more fortunate then herself, who perhaps has the worth of
half a crown round her neck; and she who has a few glass
beads, or some sort of coarse c6ral, a couple of silver
brooches, or rings on her arms and legs, is considered as
truly rich and great. Some of them are as complete coquettes in their way as any to be seen in the capitals of
Europe.
When a young man wants to marry, he goes to the father of the-intended bride, and agrees with him what he is
-to pay for her.'. This being settled, so much money is to be
spent on the wedding-day feast. To set up housekeeping,
nothing is requisite but two or three earthen pots, a stone
to grind meal, and a mat which is the bed. The spouse
has a gown and jewels of her own; and if the bridegroom
present her with a pair of bracelets of silver, ivory, or
glass, she is happy and fortunate indeed.
The house is ready, without rent or taxes. No rain can
pass through the roof; and there is no door, for there is no
want of one, as there is nothing to lose. They make a kind
/of box of clay and straw, which, after two or three days'
exposure to the sun, becomes quite hard. It is fixed on a
stand, an ap'erture is left to put all their precious things into
it, and a piece of mummy-case forms the door. If the house
does not please them, they walk out and enter another, as
there are several hundreds at their command; I might say
several thousands, but they are not all fit to receive inhabitants.

Or doffed thine own to let Queen Dido pass,
Or held, by Solomon's own invitation,
A torch at the great Temple's dedication.
I need not ask thee if that hand, when armed,
Has any Roman soldier mauled and knuckled,
For thou wert dead, and buried, and embalmed,
Ere Romulus and Remus had been suckled  -
Antiquity appears to have begun
Long after thy primeval race was run.
Since first thy form was in this box extended,
We have, above ground, seen some strange mutations;
The Roman empire has begun and ended;
New worlds have risen-we have lost old nationsj
And countless kings have into dust been humbled,
While not a fragment of thy flesh9 has crumbled.
Didst thou not hear the pother o'er thy head,
When the great Persian conqueror; Cambyses,
March'd armies o'er thy tomb with thundering tread,

And shook the Pyramids with fear and wonder,
When the gigantic Memnon fell asunder?

WrITEN breezes are soft, and skies are fai;r
I steal an hour from study and care,
And hie me away to the woodland scene,
WVhere wanders the stream with waters of fgreen
As if the bright fringe of herbs on its brink
Had given their stain to the wave they drink.
And they, whose meadows it murmurs through,
Have named the stream from its own fair hue.
Yet pure its waters, its shallows are bright
With colored pebbles and sparkles of light,
And clear the depths where the eddies play,
And dimples deepen and whirl away;
And the plane-tree's speckled a,ns o'ershoot
The swifter current that mines its root;
Through whose shifting' leaves, as youl walk the hill,.
The quiver;ng glinmmer of sun and rill
With a sudden flash on the eye is throwrn,

To bathe in those waters so pure and sweet.
Yet, fair as thou art, thou shunnest to glide,
Beautiful stream! by the village side,
But windest away from haunts of men,
To silent valley, and shaded glen.
And forest, and meadow, and slope of hill,
Around thee, are lonely, lovely, and still.
Lonely-save when, by thy rippling tides,
From thicket to thicket the angler glides;
Or the simpler comes, with basket and book,
For herbs of power on thy banks to look:
Or haply some idle dreamer like me,
To wander, and muse, and gaze on thee.

On the river cherry and seedy reed;
And thy own wild music, gushing out
With mellow murmur, or fairy shout,
From dawn to the blush of another day,
Like traveller singing along his way.
That fairy music I never hear,
Nor gaze on those waters so green and clear,
And mark them winding away from sight,
Darkened with shade, or flashing with light,
While o'er thee the vine to its thicket clings,
And the zephyr stoops to freshen his wings;But I wish that fate had left me free
To wander these quiet haunts with thee,
Till the eating cares of earth should depart,
And the peace of the scene pass into my heart;
And I envy thy stream as it glides along
ThroLugh its beautiful barnlts, in a trance of song.
Though forced to drudge for the dregs of men,
And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen
And mingle among the jostling crowd,
Where the sons of strife are subtle and loud;
I sometimes come to this quiet place,
To breathe the air that ruffles thy face,
And gaze upon thee in silent dream;
For, in thy lonely and lovely stream,
An image of that calm life appears

[Lweon 4P~LESSON XLIII.
The mutual relation between sleep and night.-PALEY.
THE relation of sleep to night appears to have been expressly intended by our benevolent Creator. Two points
are manifest; first, that the animal frame requires sleep;
secondly, that night brings with it a silence, and a cessation
of activity, which allow ol sleep being taken without interruption, and without loss.  Animal existence is made up of
action and slumber: nature has provided a season for each.
An animal which stood not in need of rest, would always live
in day-light.  An animal, which, though m.ade for action,
and delighting in action, must have its strength repaired by
sleep, meets, by its -constitution, the returns of day and
night. In the human species, for instance, were the bustle,
the labor, the motion of life upheld by the constant presence of light, sleep could not be enjoyed without being disturbed by noise, and without expense of that time which the
eagerness of private interest would not contentedly resign.
It is happy, therefore, for this part of the creation, I mean
that it is conformable to the frame and wants of their constitution, that nature, by the very disposition of her elements, has commanded, as it were, and imposed upon them,
at moderate -i,:,ervals,  a general intermission of their toils,
their occupaiOns, and their pursuits.
But it is not for man, either solely or principally, that
night is made. Inferior, but less perverted natures, taste
its solace, and expect its return, with greater exactness and
advantage than he does.  I have often observed, and never
observed but to admlire, the satisfaction, no less than the
regularity, with which the greatest part of the irrational
world yield to this soft necessity, this grateful vicissitude;
how comfortably the birds of the air, for example, address themselves to the repose of the evening; with Nwhat
alertness they resume the activity of the day.
Nor does it disturb our argument to confess, that certain
species of animals are in motion during the night, and at
rest in the day.  With respect even to them, it is still true,
that tbere is a change of condition in the animal, and an external change corresponding with it.  There is still the relation, though inverted.  The fact is, that the repose of
other animals sets these at liberty, and invites them  to their
food or their sport.
Lesson 43.1
109If the relation of sleep to night, and in some instances,
its converse, be real, we cannot reflect without amazement
upon the extent to which it carries us.  Day and night are
things close to us; the change applies immediately to oU1
sensations; of all the phenomena of nature, it is the most
obvious, and the most familiar to our experience: but, in its
cause, it belongs to the great motions which are passing in
the heavens.  Whilst the earth glides round her axle, she
ministers to the alternate necessities of the animals dwelling
upon her surface, at the same time tlhtt she obeys the ilfluence of those attractions which regulate the order of many
thousand worlds.  The relation therefore of sleep to night,
is the relation of the inhabitants of the earth to the rotation
of their globe: probably it is more; it is a relation to the
system, of which. that globe is a part; and, still further, to
the congregation of systems, cf which theirs is only one.
If this account be true, it connects the meanest individual
with the universe itself; a chicken, roosting upon its perch,
with the spheres revolving in the firmamrient.
LESSON XLIV.
Social worship agreeable to the best impulses of our nature.--,
MIRS. BARBAULD.
SENTIMENTS of admiration, love and joy, swell the bosom
with emotions which seek for fellowship and communication.
The flame indeed may be kindled by silent musing; but
when kindled it must infallibly spread. The devout heart,
penetrated with large and affectiDg views of the immensity
of the works of God, the harmony of his laws, and the extent af his beneficence, bursts into loud and vocal expressions of praise and adoration; and from a full and overflowing sensibility, seeks to expand itself to the utmost limits of
ireation.  The mind is forcibly carried out of itself, andembracing the whole circle of animated existence, calls on
all above, around, below, to help to bear the burden of its
gratitude.  Joy is too brilliant a thing to be confined within
our own bosoms; it burnishes all nature, and with its vivid
coloring gives a kind of factitious life to objects without
sense or motion.  There cannot be a more striking proof
of the social tendency of these feelings, than the strong propesnity we have te szippos  auditors wheni there are none.
110
THE A31ERICAN
[Lesson 4t.When men are wanting, we address the animal creation;
and rather than have none to partake of our feelings, we
find sentiment in the music of birds, the hum of insects
and the low of kine: nay, we call on rocks and streams and
forests to witness and share our emotions. Hence the royal
shepherd, so'journing in caves and solitary wastes, calls on
the hills to rejoice, and the floods to clap their hands: and
the lonely poet, wandering in the deep recesses of uncultivated nature, finds a temple in every solemn grove, and
swells his chorus of praise with the winds that bow the lofty cedars. And can he, who, not satisfied with the wide
range of animated existence, calls for the sympathy of the
inanimate creation, refuse to worship with his fellow men?
Can he who bids "Nature attend," forget to "join every
living soul" in the universal hymn? Shall we suppose
companions in the stillness of deserts, and siall we overlook
them amongst friends and townsmen?  It cannot be! Social worship, for the devout heart, is not more a duty than
it is a real want.

Lord Bacon, (in his study.) Now, my pen, rest awhile.

and tell the spiders not to be astonished if their holes are

sort.  And now, as I lift each book, methinks its cumbrous
leaves club all their syllegisms, and conspire to weigh down
that feeble arm, which has just been employed in transcribing the Novum  Organon.  Alas! that folly and falsehood
should be so hard to grapple with-but he that hopes to

tired. My single brain is matched against the errors of,nousands; and yet every time I return to reflect upon the
laws of nature, she meets my thoughts with a more palpable sanction, and a voice seems to whisper from the midst
of her machinery, that I have not inquired in vain.    Ho!
who waits in the antichamber there? Does any one desire
an audience?
Page. The Queen has sent unto your lordship, Mr. William Shakspeare the player.
Bacon. Indeed!-I have wished to see that man.  Show
him in. Report says, her majesty has lately tasked him to
write a play upon a subject chosen by herself.  Good-morrow, Mr. Shakspeare.
Shakspeare. Save your lordship! here is an epistle -from
her majesty.
Bacon. (Reads.) " The Queen desiies, that as Mr. Shakspeare would fain have some savor of the Queen's own
poor vein of poesy, he may be shown the book of sonnets,
written by herself, and now  in the keeping of my Lord
Chancellor, who indeed may well keep what he hath so
much flattered; although she does not command him to hide
it altogether from the knowing and judicious."
Shakspeare. How  gracious is her majesty! Sure the
pen, for which she exchanges her sceptre, cannot choose but
drop golden thoughts.
Bacon. You say well, Mr. Shakspeare. But let us sit
down and discourse awhile.  The sonnets will catch no
harm by our delay, for true poetry, they say, hath a bloom
which time cannot blight.
Shakspeare. True, my lord. Near to Cas alia there bubbles also a fountain of petrifying water, wherein the muses
are wont to dip'whatever posies have met the approval of
-Apollo; so that the slender foliage, which originally sprung
forth in the cherishing brain of a true poet, becomes hardened in all its leaves, and glitters as if it were carved out of
rubies and emeralds. The elements have afterwards no
power over it.
Bacon. Such will be the fortune of your own productions.
Shakspeare. Ah, my lord! do not encourage me to hope
so. I am but a poor unlettered man, who seizes whatever
rude conceits his own natural vein supplies him with, upon
the enforcement of haste and necessity; and therefore I
fear that such as are of deeper studies than myself will
JJ23
[Lesson 45.
THE AMERICANfind many flaws in m}i handiwork to laugh at both now and
herecafter.
Bacon. He that can make the multitude laugh and weep
as you do, Mr. Shakspeare, need not fear scholars.--A head
naturally fertile and for'getive is worth many libraries, inasmuch as a tree is more valuable than a basket of fruit, or
a good hawk better than a bag full of game, or the little
purse which a fairy gave to Fortunatus more inexhaustible
than all the coffers in the treasury. More scholarship might
have sharpened your judgment, but the particulars whereof
a character is composed, are better assembled by force of
imagination than of judgment, which, although it perceive
coherences, cannot summon up materials, nor melt them
into a compound, with that felicity which belongs to imagination alone.
Shakspeare. My lord, thus far I know, that the first
glimpse and conception of a character in my mind are always
engendered by chance and accident.  We shall suppose, for
instance, that I am  sitting in a tap-room, or standing in a
tennis-court. The behavior of some one fixes my attention. I note his dress, the sound of his voice, the turn of
his countenance, the drinks he calls for, his questions and
retorts, the fashion of his person, and, in brief, the whole
out-goings and in-comings of the man.--These grounds of
speculation being cherished and revolved in my fancy, it becomes straightway possessed with a swarm of conclusions
and beliefs concerning the individual.  In walking home, I
picture out to myself, what would be fitting for him to say
or do upon any given occasion, and these fantasies being recalled at some after period, when I am writing a play, shape
themselves into divers mannikins, who are not long of being
nursed into life. Thus come  forth Shallow, and Slender,
and Mercutio, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek.
Bacon. These are characters which may be foun(d alive -i"n
the streets.  But how frame you such interloc'utors as Brutus and Coriolfinus?
Slakspeare. By searching histories, in the first place,
my lord, for the germ: The filling up afterwards comes
rather from feeling than observation. I turn myself into a
Brutus or a Coriolanus for the time; and can, at least in
fancy, partake sufficiently of the nobleness of their nature,
to ptut proper words into their mouths. Observation will
not supply the poet with every thing. He must have a
st;c"k of exalted sentiments in his own mind.
10*
Lesson 45.]
113Bacon. In trui h, Mr. Shakspeare, you have observed the
world so well, and so widely, that I can scarce believe you
ever shut your eyes. I too, although much engrossed with
other studies, am, in part, an observer of mankind. Their
dispositions, and the causes of their good or bad fortune,
cannot well be overlooked even by the most devoted questioner of physical nature. But note the difference of habitudes. No sooner have I observed and got hold of particulars, than they are taken up by my judgment to be commented upon, and resolved into general laws. Your imagination keeps them to make pictures of. My judgment, if
she find them to be comprehended under something already
known by her, lets themn drop, and forgets them; for which
reason, a certain book of essays, which I am writing, will
be small in bulk, but I trust not light in substance.-Thus
do men severally follow their inborn dispositions.
Shakspeare. Every word of your lordship's will be an
adage to after times. For my part, I know my own place,
and aspire not after the abstruser studies: although I can
give wisdom a welcome when she comes -in my way. But
the inborn dispositions, as your lordship has said, must not
be warped from their natural bent, otherwise nothing but
sterility will remain behind. A leg cannot be changed into
an arm. Among stage-players, our first object is to exercise
a new candidate, until we discover where his vein lies.
Bacon. I am told that you do not invent the plots of
your own plays, but generally borrow them from some common book of' stories, such as Bocaccio's Docameron, or
Cynthio's Novels. That practice must save a great expenditure of thought and contrivance.
Shakspeare.  It does, my lord. I lack patienc3 to invent
the whole from the foundation.
Bacon. If I guess aright, there is nothing so hard and
troublesome as the invention of coherent incidents; and yet,
methinks, after it is accomplished, it does not show so h,igh
a strain of wit as that which paints separate characters ail:d
objects well. Dexterity would achieve the making of a plot
better than genius, which delights not so much in tracing
a curious connexion among events, as in adorning a fantasy
with bright colors, and eking it out with suitable appendages. Homer's plot hangs but ill together. It is indeed
no better than a string of popular fables and superstitions,
caught up from  among the Greeks; and I believe that
they who, in the time of Pisis'tratus, collected this poem,

[Lesson 45.
THE AMERICANdid more than himself to digest its particulars. His praise
must therefore be found in this, that he reconceived, amplified, and set forth, what was but dimly and poorly conceived
by common men.
Shakspeare. My knowledge of the tongues is but small,
on which account I have read ancient authors mnostly at
second hand. I remember, when I first came to London,
and began to be a hanger-on at the theatres, a great desire
grew in me for more learning than had fallen to my share
at Stratford; but fickleness and impatience, and the bewilderment caused by new objects, dispersed that wish into
empty air. Ah, my lord, you cannot conceive what a strange
thing it was for so impr-essible a rustic, to find himself
turned loose in the midst of Babel! My faculties wrought
to such a degree, that I was in a dream all day long. My
bent was not then toward comedy, for most objects seemed
noble and of much consideration. The music at the theatre
ravished my young heart; and amidst the goodly company
of spectators, I beheld, afar off, beauties who seemed to
out-paragon Cleopatra of Egypt. Some of these primitive
fooleries were afterwards woven into Romeo and Juliet.
Bacon. Your Julius Ctesar and your Richard the Third
please me batter. From  my youth upward I have had a
brain politic and discriminative, and less prone to marvelling and dreaming than to scrutiny. Some part of my juvenile time was spent at the court of France, with our ambassador, Sir Amias Paulet; and to speak the truth, although
I was surrounded by many dames of high birth and rare
beauty, I carried oftener Machiavelli* in my pocket than
a book of madrigals, and heeded not although these wantons made sport of my grave and scholar-like demeanor.
When they would draw me forth to an encounter of their
wit, I paid them  off with flatteries, till they forgot their
aim in thinking of themselves. Michael Angelo said of
Painting, that she was jealous, and required the whole man,
undivided. I was aware how much more truly the same
thing might be said of I'hilosophy, and therefore cared not
bow  much the ruddy complexion of my youth was sullied
over the midnight lamp, or my outward comeliness sacrificed to my inward advancement.
Shakspeare.  Speaking of bodily habitudes, is it true that
your lordship swoons whenever the moon is eclipsed, even
though unaware of what is then passing in the heavens

LESSON XLVI.
On the relative value of good sense and beautty, in tte female
sex.-LITERARY GAZETTE.
NOTWITHISTANDING the lessons of moralists, and the declamations of philosophers, it cannot be denied that all mankind have a natural love, and even respect, for external
beauty. In vain do they represent it as a thing of no value
in itself, as a frail and perishable flower; in vain do they
exhaust all the depths of argument, all the stores of fancy,
to prove the worthlessness of this amiable gift of nature.
However persuasive their reasonings may appear, and however we may, for a time, fancy ourselves convinced by them,
we have in our breasts a certain instinct, which never fails
to tell us, that all is not satisfactory, and though we may
not be able to prove that they are wrong, we feel a conviction that it is impossible that they should be right.
They are certainly right in blaming those who are rendered vain by the possession of beauty, since vanity is at all
times a fault: but there is a great difference between being
116
[Lesson 46.
THE AMIERICANvain of a thing, and being happy that we have it; and that
beauty, however little merit a woman can claim to herself
for it, is really a quality which she may reasonably rejoice
to possess, demands, I think, no very labored proof.  Every
one naturally wishes to please. To this end, we know how
important it is that the first impression we produce should
be favorable.  Now this first impression is commonly produc_d through the medium of the eye; and this is frequently so powerful as to resist for a long time the opposing evidence of subsequent observation.   Let a man of
even the soundest judgment be presented to two women,
equally strangers to him, but the one extremely handsome,
the other without any remarkable advantages of person,
and lie will, without deliberation, attach himself first to the
former.  All men seem  in this to be actuated by the same
principle as Socrates, who used to say, that when he saw a
beautiful person, he always expected to see it animated by
a beautiful soul.
The ladies, however, often fall into the fatal error of
imagining that a fine person is, in our eyes, superior to
every other accomplishment, and those who are so happy as
to be endowed with it, rely, with vain confidence, on its irresistible power, to retain hearts as well as to subdue them.
-Hence the lavish care bestowed on the improvement of
exterior and perishable charms, and the neglect of solid and
durable excellence; hence the long list of arts that administer to vanity and folly, the countless train of glittering
acomplishments, and the scanty catalogue of truly valuable acquirements, which compose, for the most part, the
modern svstem of fashionable female education. Yet so far
is beauty from being in our eyes an excuse for the want of
a cultivated mind, that the women who are blessed with
it, have, in reality, a much harder task to performi, than
those of their sex who are not so distinguished. Even
our self-love here takes part against them; we feel ashamed of having suffered ourselves to be caught like children, by mere outside, and perhaps even fall into the contrary extreme.
Could " the statue that enchants the woild,"-the Venus
de Medicis, at the prayer of some new Pygnlalion, become
suddenly animated, how  disapointed would he be, if she
were not endowed with a soul answerable to the inimitable
perfection of her heavenly form? Thus it is with a fine
woman, whose only accomplishment is external excellenoe
Lesswit 46.1
117She may dazzle for a time; but when a man has once
thought, "what a pity that such a masterpiece should be
but a walking statue!" her emnpire is at an end.
On the other hand, when a woman, the plainness of
whose features prevented our noticing her at first, is found,
upon nearer acquaintance, to be possessed of the more
solid and valuable perfections of the mind, the pleasure we
feel in being so agreeably undeceived, makes her appear
to still greater advantage: and as the mind of man, when
left to itself, is naturally an enemy to all injustice, we,
even unknown to ourselves, strive to repair the wrong we
have involuntarily done her, by a double portion of attention and regard.
If these observations be founded in truth, it will appear
that, though a woman with a cultivated mind may justly
hope to please, without even any superior advantages of
person, the loveliest creature that ever came from  the hand
of her Creator can hope only for a transitory empire, unless she unite with her beauty the more durable charms of
intellectual excellence.
The favored child of nature, who combines in herself
these united perfections, may be justly considered as the
masterpiece of the creation-as the most perfect image of
the Divinity here below.  Man, the proud lord of the creation, bows willingly his haughty neck beneath her gentle
rule.  Exalted, tender, beneficent is the love that she inspires.  Even Time himself shall respect the all-powerful
magic of her beauty.  Her charms may fade, but they shall
never wither; and memory still, in the evening of life,
hanging with fond affection over the blanched rose, shall
view, through the veil of lapsed years, the tender bud, the
dawning promise, whose beauties once blushed before the
beams of the morning sun.
LESSON  XLVII.
A morning in the Highlands of Scotland.-Punishment of a
Spy whose employers had betrayed PLob Boy Mlac Greg,or.*
SCOTT.
I SIIALL never forget the delightful sensation with which
* At the time this celebrated Highland Chieftain was taken prisonci,
iMorris had been sent as a hostage for his personal safety, which being
tiolated.excited the wrath so powerfully described in this extract.I exchanged the dark, smoky, smothering atmosphere of the
Highland hut, in which we had passed the night so uncomfortably, for the refreshing friagrance of the morning air,
and the glorious beams of the risinr sun, which, from  a tabernacle of purple and golden clouds, were darted fuill on
such a scene of natural romanc6 and beauty as had never
before greeted my eyes.  To the left lay the valley, down
which the F'orth vwandered on its easterly course, surroundin g the beautiful detached hill, with all its garland of woods.
On the right, amid a profusion of thickets, knolls, and
crabs, lay the bed of a broad mountain lake, lightly curled
into tiny waves by the breath of the morning breeze, each
glittering in its course undar the influence of the sunbeams.
High hills, rocks, and banks, waving with natural forests of
birch and oak, formed the borders of this enchanting sheet
of water; and, as their leaves rustled to the wind and twinkled in the sun, gave to the depth of solitude a sort of life
and vivacity.  Mian alone seemed to be placed in a state of
inferiority, in a scene where all the ordinary features of nature were raised and exalted,
It was under the burning influence of revenge that the
wife of MacGregor commanded that the hostage, exchanged
for her husband's safety, should be brought into her presence.
I believe her sons had kept this unfortunate wretch out of
her sight, for fear of the consequences; but if it was so,
their humane precaution only postponed his fate. They
dragged forward, at her summons, a wretch, already half
dead with terror, in whose agonized features, I rec'ognised,
to my horror and astonishment, my old acquaintance Morris.
He fell prostrate before the female chief with an effoit
to clasp her knees, from  which she drew back, as if his
touch had been pollution, so that all he could do in to'ken
of the extremity of his humiliation, was to kiss the hem of
her plaid.  I never heard entreaties for life poured forth
with such agony of spirit.   The ecstasy of fear was such,
that, instead of paralyzing his tongue, as on ordinary occasions, it even rendered him eloquent, and, with cheeks as
pale as ashes, hands compressed in agony, eyes that seemedc
to be taking their last look of all mortal objects, he protested, with the deepest oaths, his total ignorance of any
design on the life of Rob Roy, whom  he swore he loved
and honored as his own soul.-In the inconsistency of his
terror, he said, he was but the agent of Others, and he
Lesson 47.]
119muttered the name of Rashleigh.--He prayed but for life
-for life he would give all he had in the world;-it
was but life he asked-life, if it were to be prolonged
under tortures and privations;-he  asked  only breath,
though it should be, drawn in the damps of the, lowest caverns of their hills.:   
It is impossible to'describe the scorn, the loathing, and
contempt, with which the wiife of MacGregor regarded this
wretched petitioner for the poor boon of existence.;I could have bid you live," she said, "had life been to
vou the same weary and wasting burden that it is to methat it is to every noble and4 generous mind.--But youwretch! you could creep through the world unaffected by
its various disgraces, its ineffable miseries, its constantly accumulating masses of crime and sorrow,-you could live
and enjoy yourself, while the noble-minded are betrayed,while nameless and birthless villains tread on the neck of
the brave and long-decended,-you could enjoy yourself,
like a butcher's dog in the shambles, battening on garbage,
while the slaughter of the brave went on around you!
This enjoyment you shall not live to partake  of; you
shall die, base dogr, and that before yon cloud has passed
over the sun."
She gave a brief command, in Gaelic, to her attendants,
two of whom seized upon the prostrate suppliant, and hurried him to the brink of a cliff which overhung the flood.
He set up the most piercing and dreadful cries that fear
ever uttered-I may well term  them  dreadful, for they
haunted my sleep for years afterwards.  As the murderers,
or executioners, call them  as you will, dragged him  along,
he r6cognised me even in that moment of horror, and exclaimed, in the last articulate words I ever heard him  utter,
" O, Mr. Osbaldistone, save me!-save me!"
I was so much moved by this horrid spectacle, that although in momentary expectation of sharing his fate, I did
attempt to speak in. his behalf, but, as might have been expected, my interference was sternly disregarded.  The victim was held fast by some, while others, bindinig a large
heavy stone in a plaid, tied it round his neck, and others
again eagerly stripped him of some part of his dress.  Half
naked, and thus manacled, they hurried him into the lake,
there about twelve feet deep, dro-wning his last death-shriek
with a loud halloo of vindictive triumph, over which, however, the yell of mortal agony was distinctly heard.  The`49P.
[Lessoni 47 1heavy burden splashed in the dark-blue waters of the lake,
and the Highlanders, with their pole-axes and swords,
watched an instant, to guard, lest, extricating himself from
the load to which he was attached, he might- have struggled
to regain the shore. But the knot had been securely bound;
the victim sunk without effort; the waters, which his fall
had disturbed, settled calmly over him, and the unit of that
life for which he had pleaded so strongly, was for ever
withdrawn from the sum of human existence.
LESSON XLVIII.
April Day.-ANoNYMous.*
ALL day the low-hung clouds have dropt
Their garnered fulness down;
All day that soft, gray mist hath wrapt
Hill, valley, grove, and town.
There has not been a sound to-day
To break the calm of nature;
Nor motion, I might almost say,
Of life, or living creature;Of vwaving bough, or warbling bird,
Or cattle faintly lowing;I could have half believed I heard
The leaves and blossoms growing.
I stood to hear-I love it wellThe rain's continuous sound;
Small drops, but thick and fast they fell,
Down straight into the ground.
For leafy thickness is not yet
Earth's naked breast to screen,
Though every dripping branch is set
With shoots of tender green.
Sure, since I looked at early morn,
Those honey-suckle buds
Have swelled to double growth; that thorn
Hath put forth larger studs.

LESSON L.
The WThite Bear.-PERCIVAL.
THE white bear of Greenland and Spitzber(en is considerably larger than the brown bear of Europe, or the black
bear of North America.  This animal lives upon fish and
seals, and is seen not only upon land in the countries bordering on the North Pole, but often upon floats of ice
several leagues at sea. The following relation is extracted
from the " Journal of a Voyage for making discoveries
towards the North Pole."
Early in the morning, the man at the mast-headl gave
notice that three bears were making their way very fast
over the ice, and that they were directing their course
towards the ship.  They had, without question, been invited by the scent of the blabber of a sea-horse, killed
a few days before, which the men had set on fire, and which
was burning on the ice at the time of their approach.
12'3
Le0sson 50.]
FIRST CLASS BQOOK.They proved to be a she-bear and her two cubs; but the
cubs were nearly as large as the dam. They ran eagerly to
the fire, and drew out from the flames part of the flesh of
the sea-horse that remained unconsumed, and ate it voraciously. The crew from the ship threw great lumps of the
flesh of the sea-horse, which they had still left, upon the
ice.  These the old bear carried away singly; laid every
lump before her cubs as she brought it, and dividing it, gave
each a share, reserving but a small portion to herself. As
she was taking away the last piece, they levelled their
muskets at the cubs, and shot them both dead; and in her
I?etreat, they wounded the dam, but not mortally.
It would have drawn tears of pity from any but unfeeling
minds to mark the affectionate concern expressed by this
poor beast, in the last moments of her expiring young.
Though she was sorely wounded, and could but just crawl
to the place where they lay, she carried the lump of flesh
which she had fetched away, and placed it before them.
Seeing that they refused to eat, she laid her paws first
upon one and then upon the ether, and endeavored to
raise them up. It was pitiful to hear her moan. When she
found she could not stir them, she went off; and, stopping
when she had gotten to some distance, she looked back and
moaned. Wlhen she found that she could not entice them
away, she returned, and smelling around them, began to lick
their wounds.  She went off a second time as before; and
having crawled a few paces, looked again behind her, and
for some time stood moaning. But still her cubs not rising
to follow her, she returned to them again, and, with signs of
inexpressible fondness, went round one and round the other, pawing them and moaning. Finding at last that they
were cold and lifeless, she raised her head towards the ship
and growled at the murderers, who then shot her with a volley of musket balls.  She fell between her cubs and died
licking their wounds.
LESSON LI.
The Miseries of War.-ROBERT HALL.
TIotUGri the whole race of man is doomed to dissolution,
and we are all hastening to our long home; yet at each suc124
[Lesson 51
THIE AMERICANcessive moment, life and death seem to divide between them
the dominion of mankind, and life to have the larger share.
It is otherwise in war: death reigns there without a rival,
and without control. War is the work, the element, or
rather the sport and triumph of Death, who glories not
only in the extent of his conquest, but in the richness of his
spoil. In the other methods of attack, in the other forms
which death assumes, the feeble and the aged, who at the
best can live but a short time, are usually the victims; here
they are the vigorous and the strong.
It is remarked by the most ancient of poets, that in peace
children bury their parents, in war parents bury their children: nor is the difference small. Children lament their
parents, sincerely, indeed, but with that moderate and tranquil sorrow, which it is natural for those to feel who are
conscious of retaining many tender ties, many animating
prospects. Parents mourn for their children with the bitterness of despair; the aged parent, the widowed mother,
loses, when she is deprived of her children, every thing but
the capacity of suffering; her heart, withered and desolate,
admits no other object, cherishes no other hope. It is Rachel, weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are not.
But, to confine our attention to the number of the slain,
would give us a very inadequate idea of the ravages of the
sword. The lot of those who perish instantaneously may
be considered, apart from religious prospects, as comparatively happy, since they are exempt from those lingering
diseases and slow torments to which others are liable. We
cannot see an individual expire, though a. stranger, or an
enemy, without being sensibly moved, and prompted by
compassion to lend him every assistance in our power.
Every trace of resentment vanishes in a moment: every
other emotion gives way to pity and terror.
In these last extremities we remember nothing but the respect and tenderness due to our common nature.  What a
scene then must a field of battle present, where thousands
are left without assistance, and without pity, with their wounds
exposed to the piercing air, while the blood, freezing as it
flows, binds them to the earth, amidst the trampling of
horses, and the insults of an enraged foe! If they are
spared by the humanity of the enemy, and carried from the
field, it is but a prolongation of torment.  Conveyed in uneasy vehieles, often to a remote distance, through roads

it impossible to give to each the attention he demands.  Far
from their native home, no tender assiduities of friendship,
no well-known voice, no wife, or mother, or sister, is near
to sooth their sorrows, relieve their thirst, or close their
eyes in death! Unhappy man! and must you be swept into
the grave unnoticed and unnumbered, and no friendly teai
be shed for your sufferings, or mingled with your dust?
We must remember, however, that as a very small proportion of a military life is spent in actual combat, so it is a
very small part of its miseries which must be ascribed to
this source. More are consumed by the rust of inactivity
than by the edge of the sword; confined to a scanty or unwholesome diet, exposed in sickly climates, harassed with
tiresome marches and perpetual alarms; their life is a continual scene of hardships and dangers. They grow familiar
with hunger, cold, and watchfulness. Crowded into hospitals and prisons, contagion spreads amongst their ranks,
till the ravages of disease exceed those of the eneiny.
We have hitherto only adverted to the sufferings of those
who are engaged in the profession of arms, without taking
into our account the situation of the countries which are
the scene of hostilities. How dreadful to hold every thing
at the mercy of an enemy, and to receive life itself as a
boon dependent on the sword! How boundless the fears
which such a situation must inspire, where the issues of life
and death are determined by no known laws, principles, or
customs, and no conjecture can be formed of our destiny,
except as far as it is dimly deciphered in characters of
blood, in the dictates of revenge, and the capric'es of power!
Conceive but for a moment the consternation which the
approach of an invading army would impress on the peaceful
villages in our own neighborhood.  When you have placed
yourselves for an instant in that situation, you will learn
to sympathize with those unhappy countries which have sustained the ravages of arms.  But how is it possible to give
you an idea of these horrors? Here you behold rich harvests, the bounty of Heaven, and the reward of industry,
consumed in a moment, or trampled under foot, while famine
and pestilence follow the steps of desolation. There the

Consideration of the excuses that are offered to pallzate a neglect of religion.-IBucySIINSTE R.
FIRST, it is often said, that time is wanted for the duties
of religion.  The calls of business, the press of occupation,
the cares of life, will not suffer me, says one, to give that
time to the duties of piety, which otherwise I would gladly
bestow.  Say.you this without a blush? You have no time,
then, for the especial service of that great Being, whose
goodness alone has drawn out to its present length your
cobweb thread of life; whose care alone has continued you
*Pron. bad.
Lesson 53.]
IOQUin possession of that unseen property, which you call your
time.  You have no time, then, to devote to that gvreat
Being, on whose existence  th  e i         ofte! o f'' universe
depends; a Being so grea.-.t thai i: his attinti'cn could for
an instant be diverted, yo  fa li never a.ain tmo risoe  il h is
promise should fail, your hopes, your expectatiocs vanish
into air; if his power should be weakened, man, angel,
nature perishes.
But, let me ask by what right do you involve yourself
in this multiplicity of cares?   -Wh;  do you ecve  arouand
you this web of occupation, and then ccmpnatin-, that you
calnot break it?  Will you say, that your tirme.is your own,
and that you have a right to employ in ii thIe manner
you please?  Believe me, it is not you owln.  it belongs to
God, to religion, to mankind.  You pomssess not a1 hour, to
which one of these puts not in a prefrabole c,nlaim;  and are
such claimants to be dismissed without allottiig to them a
rrmoment?
But for what else can you find no leisure?  Do you find
none for amusement? Or is amusement itself your occupation?  Perhaps pleasure is the pressinc business of your
life; perhaps pleasure stands walting to catch your precious moments as they pass.  Do you find none for the pursuit of curious and secular knowledge?   If you find none,
then, for religion, it is perhaps because you wish to find
none; it would be, you think, a tasteless occupation, an insipid entertainment.
But this excuse is founded on a most erroneous conception of the nature of religion. It is supposed to be something, which interrupts business, whlich wastes tirne, and interferes with all the pleasant and profitable pursuits of life.
It is supposed to be something whiiMch must be practised
apart from  every thing else, a distinct profession, a peculiar
occupation.   The  means  of religion, meditation, reading, and prayer, will, aTnd ought, indeed, to occupy distinct
portions of our time.  But religion itself demands not distinct hours.  Religion -will attend you not as a trouble,some,
but as a pleasant and useful companion in every proper
place, and every temperate occupation  of life.   It will
follow  you to the  warehouse  or to the office;  it will
retreat with you to the country, it will dwell with you in
town; it will cross the seas, or travel over mountains, or
remain with you at home.  Without your consent, it will
not desert you in prosperity, or forget you in adversity.  Ii

wsvalk wvith yotu in o'ladsorne union to the house of God; it
will follow you beyond the confines of the world, and dwell
xvith you in heavcn for ever, as its native residence.
Ag'aill, it is said, am I not as good as others?  Why is
an attention to religion, an unpopular piety, a rigid virtue
requiredi of me, which cannot be found in the circle of my
acquaintance, or in the wsorld at large?  Whly am I urged to
set up as a reformer, or expose myself to the scorn of mankind?  But the majority of men are poor; does this however check the ardor of your pursuit of wealth; or do you
avoid a new acquisition, because you fear it will expose
you to the envy of your inferiors?  The majority of mankind are ignorant; but is ignorance therefore honorable,
or is learning contemptible or in;idious?
WVe have now supposed, that piety and unsullied virtue
would sometimes be attended with scorn.  But even this
is an unwarranted supposition.  Piety is venerated by the
impious. Unyielding virtue is admired by the corrupt;
disinterested goodness by the selfish; temperance, chastity,
humanity, by the intemperate, unchaste, and  ambitious.
Consider, too, to what extravagance this excuse would lead.
It places you loosely floating on the inconstant tide of popular manners.  If this rises, you indeed are raised; if it
falls, you descend, howvever imperceptibly, on its surface.  It
is an excuse, which might be offered with equal propriety by
the corrupt inhabitanls of Sodom, as by you.
LESSON LIVY.
Su'jcct continued.
IT is said, religion is dull, unsocial, uncharitable, enthusiastic, a dainper ol human joy, a morose intruder upon
hunman pleasure.  If this were true, nothing could be more
incorgruous  than  the parable, which represents it as an
entertainmnent.  But if this be the character of religion, it
is surely the very reverse of wlvat we should suppose it to
be, and the reverse indeed of what it ought to be. Perhaps, in your distorted vision, you have mistaken sobriety
Lesson 54.]
13ifor dulness, equanimity for moroseness, disinclination to
bad company for aversion to society, abhorrence of vice
for uncharitableness, and piety for enthusiasm.
No doubt, at the table of boisterous intemperance, religion, if she were admitted as a guest, would wear a very
dull countenance. In a revel of debauchery, and amidst the
brisk interchange of profanity and folly, religion might appear indeed a dumb, unsocial intruder, ignorant of the
rhetoric of oaths and the ornaments of obsc6nity. These
are scenes, it must be acknowledged, of what is falsely
called pleasure, in which religion, if embodied and introduced, would be as unwelcome a guest, as the emblematic
coffin, which the Egyptians used to introduce in the midst of
their entertainments.  From such instances, however, to accuse religion of being unfriendly to the enjoyment of life, is
as absurd as to interpret unfavorably the silence of a foreigner, who understands not a word of our language.
But as long as intemperance is not pleasure, as long as
profaneness, impurity, or scandal is not wit, as long as excess is not the perfection of mirth, as long as selfishness is
not the surest enjoyment, and as long as gratitude, love, reverance, and resignation are not superstitious affections, so
long religion lays not an icy hand on the true joys of life.
Without her all other pleasures become tasteless, and at last
painful.  To explain to you, indeed, how  much she exalts,
purifies and prolongs the pleasures of sense and imagina
tion, and what peculiar sources of consolation, cheerfulness,
and contentment she opens to herself, would lead us at present into too wide a range.
Excuses for irreligion are drawn from the failings and
imperfections of christians.  There, says the profligate, are
your boasted saints.  They have their faults, as well as
those who make not so great pretensions to piety.  Thus
it happens, that some remains of imperfections, some constitutional infirmity, some unamiable weakness of good men,
is brought forward and exhibited in all the triumph of illiberality to the gaze of a censorious world.  The character
of the mind is drawn from a single trait, from some casual
wrinkle, some unlucky deformity.  The point, in which a
good man is as frail as others, is selected and contem'plated
with renewed pleasure, while those points, in which he is
superior to other men, are unobserved or unacknowledged.
This is partial, unjust, uncharitable, iniquitous.
But the excuse closes not here.  Of what religion has
[Lesson 54.
132
THE AISERICANfailed to remove, it is most absurdly called the cause. If
apparently devout and pious habits are ever found associated with a temper, which is not open as day to melting
charity, it is religion which hardens the heart, it is religion
which locks the coffers.  Whatever passion it has failed to
subdue, or whatever fault it has been unable to prevent, it
is impiously said to encourage.   Equally absurd would it
be, to attribute the wTeakness of a broken bone to the kind
attentions of the surgeon, the pain of a wounc to the balmy
hand which would assuage it.
But of all the faults of christians, from which excuses
for irreligion are drawn, the occasional extravagances into
which pious men have fallen, afford the most plausible
apologies.  The history of religion is ransacked for instances of persecution, of austerities, and enthusiastic irregularities, and when they are all collected, the cold-hearted, thoughtless irreligionist exclaims, these are the fruits of
piety!
But why is it never considered, that the same ardent
temperament, the same energy  of passions, if they  had
been united with any other subject, would have rushed into
similar extremes? In a mind of such a mould, religion, as
is often said, is the occasion only, not the cause of extravagance.  When enthusiasm, however, is the result of mere
ignorance, as it most commonly is, the excuse entirely fails.
Ignorance  is not devotion, nor the mother of devotion;
zeal is not religion, enthusiasm is not piety, solitude is not
purity, spiritual pride is not conscious innocence, and the
preternatural heat of the passions is not the warmth of love
to God or man.
You would not judge of the usual moisture of any region
from the occasional inundation of its rivers. The influence
of true religion is imild, and soft, and noiseless, and constant
as the descent of the evening dew on the tender herbage,
nourishing and refreshing all the amiable and social virtues;
but enthusiasm is violent, sudden, rattling as a summer
shower, rooting up the fairest flowers, and washing away
the richest mould in the pleasant garden of society.
Excuses for a neglect of religion are suggested by diffe.
rent seasons of life.  Youth, in the fulness of its spirits,
defers it to the sobriety of manhood; manhood, encumbered
with cares, defers it to the leisure of old age; old age,
weak and hesitating, is unable to enter on an untried mode
of life. The excuses of youth are those which are most

FIRST CLASS BOOK.frequently offered, and most easily admitted.  The restrictions of religion, though proper enoutgh for maturer age,
are too severe, it is said, for this frolicsome and gladsome
period.  Its consolations, too, thev do not want.  Leave
them  to prop the feeble limbs of old agre, or too cheer the
sinkling spirits of adversity.  False and pernicious maxim!
As if, at the end of a stated number of years, a man could
become religious in a moment! As if the husbandman, at
the end of summer, could call iup a harvest from the soil
which he had never tilled! As if manhood, too, would have
no excuses! And what are they?  That he has grown too
old to amend.  That his ptirents took no pains with his
religious education, and therefore his ignorance is not his
own fault.  That he must be making provision for old age;
and the pressure of cares will allow him  no time to attend
to the evidences, or learn the rules of religion. Thus life
is spent in framing apologies, in makinl and breaking resolutions, and protracting amendment, till death places his
cold hand on the mouth open to make its last excuse, and
one more is added to the crowded congregation of the dead,
LESSON LV.
Subject concluded.
Tmiz excuses, which we have alrel,y considered, are tli
fling, however, compared with the following.
It is said, "it is by no means certain, that there is a
future state of retribution beyond the limits of the world.
WNho has ever seen it?  It is not certain, that the religion,
which you urge us to embrace, comes from  God.  Many
objections may be made to its evidences."   Most of the
irreligion, which prevails among the more informed ciasses
of society, results from a lurking skepticism, which infests
their thoughts, and, in relation to religion, leads them  to
act in direct opposition to all the maxims, which usually
govern the conduct of men.
It is indeed true, that the existence of a future world is
not to us as certain as the existence of the present; neither
can we ever have that intuitive assurance of the being of a
God, that we necessarily possess of our own existence;
neither can the factrz of the gospel history, which happened
[Lessorz 55.two thousand years ago, be impressed on our belief with
that undotbting conviction, which we hare of the reality of
scenes, which are passing imrnmmediately before our eyes.
But the question is not, whether the gospel history can
be demon'strated.  Few sulbjects which occupy huma-n contemplation  admit strict and  matnhemlatical proof.   The
whole life of man is but a perpetual comparison of evidence, and balancing of probabilities.  And upon the supposition that religious truths are only probable, the excuse
we have mentioned will not relieve irreligion from  the
charge of presumptuous and consummate folly.
But it is said, many objections have been made to the
evidences of revelation; and many of its difficulties remain
yet unexplained.  It is true, that objections have been often
made and often  answered, and not only  answered, but
refuted.  But some difficulties, it is said, vet remain.  it is
true, they do remain; and the excuse siall be admitted,
when  any  other subject of equal importance  shail oe
produced, in which difficulties do not remain.  ThI-e  most
plausible objections, which have been made to any truth
within the circle of human knowlege, are those which
have been offered against the existence of a nmaterial world;
but did this ever check an operation in mechanics, or
excuse from his daily task a single laborer?
A man of ingenuity might offer a thousand objections
against the probability of your living till the morrow; but
would this rob you of a moment's rest, or frustrate a single
plan, which you had meditated for the approaching day?
If we subtract from the difficulties, which attend revelation,
those which have been erected by the injudicious zeal of
some of its friends in attempting to prove too much, vwe
shall find, that, in the vast storehouse of facts which history
presents, for none can there be produced a greater mass of
evidence than for the birth, the death, and resurrection 3f
Jesus Christ-and upon the supposition of their truth, irreligion is nothing better than distraction.
Another excuse, however, is offered; which perhaps has
greater secret influence in quieting the conscience than any
other.  We are desired to look at the list of great names,
who have been adversaries of christianity.  Can that evidence, it is asked, be satisfactory, which failed to convince
such minds as these - If the probable truth of revelation is
to be ascertained in this manner, the dispute will soon be
at ant end; for it would be no difficult task to produce, from

But I believe these instances are not alleged to disprove
the truth, but only to weaken the importance of Christianity.
They are alleged only to excuse an inattention to reilgion,
and show that it is not very dangerous to err with such great
names on our side. Truths, it is said, which such understandings disbelieved, surely cannot be of infinite importance.
Nothing would tend more to remove such apologies, than a
fair, impartial, and full account of the education, the characters, the intellectual pr6cesses, and the dying moments of
such men.  Then it would be seen, that their virtues were
the result of the very principles they had assailed, but from
whose influence they were unable wholly to escape.  Then
it would be seen, that they had gained by their skepticism
no new pleasures, no tranquillity of mind, no peace of conscience during life, and no consolation in the hour of death.
Such are the excuses which irreligion offers. Could you
have believed, that they were so empty, so unworthy, so
hollow, so absurd?  And shall such excuses be offered to
the God of heaven and earth? By such apologies shall
man insult his Creator? Shall he hope to flatter the ear of
Omnipotence, and beguile the observation of an omniscient
spirit?  Think you, that such excuses will gain new importance in their assent toj the throne of the Majesty on high?
Will you trust the interests of eternity in the hands of these
superficial advocates?
You have pleaded your incessant occupation. Exhibit
then the result of your employment.  Have you nothing to
produce but these bags of gold, these palaces, and farms,
these bundles of cares, and heaps of vexations? Is the eye
of Heaven to be dazzled by an exhibition of property, an
ostentatious show of treasures? You surely produce not
all these wasted hours, to prove that you had no time
for religion.  It is an insult to the Majesty of Heaven.
Again, you have pleaded your youth, and you have pleaded
your age. Which of these do you choose to maintain at
the bar of Heaven? Such trifling would not be admitted in
the intercourse of men, and do you think it will avail more
with Almighty God?
It must however be acknowledged, that the case of the
irreligious is not desperate, while excuses are thought proper
[Lesson 55and necessary.  There is some glimmering of hope, that the
man who apologizes is willing to amend.  God preserve us
from that ob'duracy of wickedness, which disdains to palliate
a crime; from  that hardihood of unbelief, which will not
give even a weak reason, and which derides the offer of
an excuse.  But the season of apologies is passing away.
All our eloquent defences of ourselves must soon cease.
Death stiffens the smooth tongue of flattery, and blots out,
with one stroke, all the ingenious excuses, which we have
spent our lives in framing.
At the marriage-supper, the places of those who refused
to come, were soon filled by a multitude of deligh.ted guests.
The God of Heaven needs not our presence to adorn his
table, for whether we accept, or whether we reject his gracious invitation, whether those who were bidden taste or
not of his supper, his house shall be filled. Though many
are called and few chosen, yet Christ has not died in vain,
religion is not without its witnesses, or heaven without its
inhabitants.  Let us then remember, that one thing is needful, and that there is a better part than all the pleasures and
selfish pursuits of this world, a part which we are encouraged to secure, and which can never be taken away.

In the wild pomp of mountain majesty!

Would gladly woo thine Echoes with his string,
Though from thy heights no more one Muse shall wave her

Mllaternal affection.--ScRAP BooK.
WoMAN's charms are certainly many and powce:ful.  The
expanding rose just bursting into beauty has an irresistible
bewitchingness;-the blooming bride led triumphantly to
the hymeneal altar awakens admiration and interest, and
the blush of her cheek fills with delight;-- but the charm of
maternity is more sublime than all these. IHeaven has imprinted in the mother's face something beyond this world,
something which claims kindred with the skies,--the angelic smile, the tender look, the waking, watchful eye,
which keeps its fond vigil over her slumbering babe.
These are objects which neither the pencil nor the chisel
can touch, which ] )etry fails to exalt, which the most eloquent tongue in vain would eulogize, and on which all description becomes ineffective.  In the heart of man lies this
lovely picture; it lives in his sympathies; it reigns in his
affections; his eye looks round in vain for such another object on earth.
Maternity, extatic sound! so twined round our hearts,
that they must cease to throb ere we forget it!'tis our first
love;'tis part of our religion.  Nature has set the mother
upon such a pinnacle, that our infant eyes and arms are,
first, uplifted to it; we cling to it in manhood; we almost
worship it in old age.  He who can enter an apartment, and
behold the tender babe feeding on its mother's beauty-.nourished by the tide of life which flovs through her generoiis veins, without a panting bosom  and a grateful eye, is

LESSON LIX.
The last days of Herculaneumz.-ScRAP BooK.
A GREAT city-situated amidst all that nature could create
of beauty and of profusion, or art collect of science and
magnificence--the growth of many ages-the residence of
enlightened multitudes-the scene of splendor, and festivity, and happiness-in one moment withered as by a spell
-its palaces, its streets, its temples, its gardens,' glowing
with eternal spring,' and its inhabitants in the full enjoyment
of all life's blessings, obliterated from their very place in
crdation, not by war or famine, or disease, or any of the
natural causes of destruction to which earth had been accustomed-but in a single night, as if by magic, and amid
the conflagration, as it were, of nature itself, presented a
subject on which the wildest imagination might grow weary
without even equalling the grand and terrible reality. The
eruption of Vesuvius, by which Herculaneum and Pompeii
were overwhelmed, has been chiefly described to us in the
letters of Pliny the younger to Tacitus, giving an account
of his uncle's fate, and the situation of the writer and his
mother. The elder Pliny had just returned from the bath,
and was retired to his study, when a small speck or cloud,
which seemed to ascend from Mount Vesuvius, attracted his
attention. This cloud gradually increased, and at length
assumed the shape of a pine tree, the trunk of earth and
vapor, and the leaves, "red cinders." Pliny ordered his
galley, and, urged by his philosophic spirit, went forward
to inspect the phenomenon.  In a short time, however, philosophy gave way to humanity, and he zealously and adventurously employed his galley in saving the inhabitants of
the various beautiful villas which studded that enchanting
coast. Amongst others, he went to the assistance of his
friend Pomponianus, who.was then at Stabiae. The storm
of fire, and the tempest of the earth, increased; and tht

of their houses, to rush out into the fields with pillows tied
down by napkins upon their heads, as their sole defence
against the sbower of stones which fell on them. This, in
the course of nature, was in the middle of the day; but a
deeper darkness than that of a winter night had closed
around the ill-fated inmates of Herculaneum.  This artificial d:arkness continued for three days and nights, and when,
at length, the sun again appeared over the spot where Her.
culaneum stood, his rays fell upon an ocean of lava! There
was neither tree, nor shrub, nor field, nor house, nor living
creature; nor visible remnant of what human hands had
reared-there was nothing to be seen, but one black extended surface still streaming with mephitic vapor, and heaved into calcined waves by the operation of fire and the undulations of the earthquake! Pliny was found dead upon
the seashore, stretched upon a cloth which had been spread
for him, where it was conjectured he had perished early,
his corpulent and apoplectic habit rendering him an easy
prey to the suffocating atmosphere.

New zmode of fishing.-SCRAP BOOx.
SEVERAL years ago, a farmer, who resided in the immediate
neighborhood of Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, kept a gander,
who had not only a great trick of wandering himself, but
also delighted in piloting forth his cackling harem, to weary
themselves in circumnavigating their native lake, or in
straying amidst forbidden fields on the opposite shore. Wishing to chleck this vagrant habit, he one day seized the gander just as he was about to spring into his favorite element,
and tying a large fish-hook to his leg, to which was attached part of a dead frog, he suffered him to proceed upon his
voyage of discovery. As had been anticipated, this bait
soon caught the eye of a greedy pike, which swallowing
the deadly hook, not only arrested the progress of the astonished gander, but forced him to perform half a dozen somersets on the surface of the water! For some time the struggle
was most amusing--the fish pulling, and th, bird screaming
with all its might-the one attempting to fly, and the other
to swim, from the invisible enemy-the gander the one man

and casting between whiles many a rueful look at his snowwhite fleet of geese and goslings, who cackled forth their
sympathy for their ailticted comml',ore.  At length victory
declared in favor of the feathered angler, who, bearing aweay
for the nearest shore, landed on the smooth green grass on,
of the finest pikes ever caught inl the Castle-loch.  This
adventure is said to have cured the gander of his propensity
for wandering; but on this point we are inclineid to be a
little skeptical--particularly as we lately heard, that, at thp
Leservoir near Glasgow, the country people are in the
habit of employing ducks in this novel mode of fishing. We
cannot, to be sure, vouch for this last hact; but, in the days
of yore, hawks were taught to bring down woodcocks and
muirfowl, and why might not a similar course of training
enable ducks to bring up pikes and perches?

Splendors beyond what gorgeoas Summer knows,
Or Autumn, with his many fruits and woods
All flushed with many hues. Come, when the rains
Have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice,'WNhen the slant sun of February pours
Into the bowers a flood of light. Approach!
The incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps,
And the broad, arching portals of the grove
Welcome thy entering.  Look, the massy trunks
Are cased in the pure crystal; branch and twig
Shine in the lucid covering; each light rod,
Nodding and twinkling in the stirring breeze,
Is studded with its trembling water-drops,
Still streaming', as they move, with colored light.
But round the parent steim the long, low boughs
Bend in a glittering ring, and arbors hide
The glassy fioor. O! you might deem the spot
The spacious cavern of some virgin mine,
Deep in the womb of Earth, where the gems grow,
And diamonds put forth radiant rods, and bud
With amethvst and topaz, and the place
Lit up, imost royally, with the pure beam

Of fairy palace, that out-lasts the nig,ht,
And fades not in the glory of the sun;
Where crystal columns send forth slender shafts
And crossing arches, and fantastic aisles*
Wind from the sight in brightness, and are lost
Among the crowded pillars.  Raise thine eye:T'hou seest no cavern roof, no palace vault;
There the blue sky, and the white drifting cloud
Look in.  Again the wildered fancy dreams
Of sporting fountains, frozen as they rose,
And fixed, with all their branching jets, in air,
And all their sluices sealed. All, all is light,
Light without shade.  But all shall pass away
With the next sun.  From numberless vast trunks,
Loosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound
Like the far roar of rivers; and the eve
Shall close o'er the brown woods as it was w,"'

The Seasonzs.-M'ONTiLY ANTI-IOLOGY.
I solitary court
The inspiring breeze, and meditate upon the book
Of nature, ever open; aiming thence
Warm fiom the heart to learn the moral song.--
PERSONS of reflection and sensibility contem'plate with interest the scenes of nature.  The changes of the year ilnpart
a color and character to their thoughts and feelingrs.  When
the seasons walk their round, when the earth buds, the corn
ripens, and the leaf falls, not only are the senses impressed,
but the mind is instructed; the heart is touched with sentiment, the fancy amused with visions. To a lover of nature
and of wisdom, the vicissitude of seasons conveys a proof
and exhibition of the wise and benevolent contrivance of
the Author of all things.
When suffering the inconveniences of the ruder parts of
the year, we may be tempted to wonder why this rotation
is necessary;--why we could not be constantly gratified
witlh vernal bloom  and fragtrance, or summer beautv and
profusion.  We imagine that, in a world of our c;. -;,n,
there would always be a blessing in the air, and  l'.o'ers
and fruits on. the earth.  The chilling blast and driving

[Lesson'2.snow, the desolated field, withered foliage, and naked trees
should make no part of the scenery which we would produce. A little thought, however, is sufficient to show the
folly, if not impiety of such distrust in the appointments of
the great Creator.
The succession and contrast of the seasons give scope to
that care and foresight, diligence and industry, which are
essential to the dignity and enjoyment of human being~,
whose happiness is connected with the exertion of their
faculties.  With our present constit-ution and state, in which
impressions on the senses enter so much into our pleasures
and pains, and the vivacity of our sensations is afficted by
comparison, the uniformity and continuance of a perpetual
spring would greatly impair its pleasing effect upon our
feelings.
The present distribution of the several parts of the year,
is evidently connected with the welfare of the whole, and
the production of the greatest sum of being and enjoyinent.
That motion in the earth, and change of place in the sun,
which cause one region of the globe to be consigned to cold,
decay, and barrenness, impart to anothex heat and life, fertility and beauty.  Whilst in our climate the earth is bound
with frost, and the'chilly smothering snows' are falling, the
inhabitants of another behold the earth, first planted with
vegetation and apparelled in verdure, and those of a third
are rejoicing in the appointed weeks of harvest.
Each season comes, attended with its benefits, and beauties, and pleasures.  All are sensible of the charms of
spring.  Then the senses are delighted with the feast, that
is furnished on every field, and on every hill.  The eye is
sweetly delayed on every object to which it turns.  It is
grateful to perceive how widely, yet chastely, nature hath
mnixed her colors and painted her robe;  how bountifully
she hath scattered her blossoms and flung her odors.  We
listen with joy to the melody she hath awakened in the
groves, and catch health from  the pure and tepid gales tlat
blow from the mountains.
When the summer exhibits the whole force of active natore, and shines in full beauty and splendor; when the
succeeding season offers its'purple stores and golden grain,'
or displays its blended and softened tints; when the winter
puts on its sullen aspect, and brings stillness and repose,

the preceding months, inviting us to reflection, and compen13

xIsating for the want of attractions abroad, by fireside delights
and home-felt joys; in all this interchange and variety we
find reason to acknowledge the wise and benevolent care of
the God of seasons.
WVe are passing from the finer to the ruder portions of
the year.   The sun emits a fainter beam, and the sky is
frequently overcast.  The gardens and fields have become
a waste, and the forests have shed their verdant honors.
The hills are no more enlivened with the bleating of floc.ls,
and the woodland no longer resounds with the song of birds.
In these changes we see evidences of our instability, and
images of our transitory state.'So flourishes and fades majestic man.'Omr life is compared to a falling leaf.  When we are disposed to count on protracted years, to defer any  serious
thoughts of futurity, and to extend our plans through a long
succession of seasons; the spectacle of' the'fading, many.
colored woods,' and the naked trees, affords a salutary admonition of our frailty.  It should teach us to fill the short
year of life, or that portion of it which may be allotted to
us, with useful employments and harmless pleasures; to
practice that industry, activity, and order, which the course
of the natural world is constantly preaching.
Let not the passions blight the intellect in the spring of
its advancement; nor indolence nor vice canker the promise
of the heart in the blossom.  Then shall the summer of
life be adorned with moral beauty; the autumn yield a
harvest of wisdom  and virtue; and the winter of age be
cheered with pleasing reflections on the past, and bright
hopes of the fiture.
LESSON  LXIII.
[In the Zo5nomia of Dr. DARWIN, among various instances recorded
by that philosophical physician of what he calls mani'acal hallucina.
tion, or mental delusion, is the case of a young farmer of AWarwickshire,
whose story was well authenticated in the public papers of the time.
A poor elderly woman in his neighborhood was in the habit, urged
by the pinching necessities of an inclenment winter, of taking a few
sticks from his grounds and his hedge, to preserve the fading fire in her
forlorn cottage.  Suspecting the delinquent, the hardhearted hind

situation, and the cruelty of her oppressor, she kneeled, and, rearing
her withered hands to the cold moon, prayed that "he might never
again know the blessing of warmth."  The consciousness of w-rong,
the solemnity of the hour, the pathetic tone, " sharp misery," and impassioned gesture of the miserable matron at once extinguished the
dim reason of the rustic. He immediately complained of a preternatura. chilness, was continually calling for more fire and clothes,

death, which happened shortly after. On this singular story is founded
the following ballad, which is in the genuine spirit of ancient English
song, and shows, by proof irrefragable. that simplicity, and the language of ordinary life, may be connected with the most exquisite
poetry.                                        Farmer's MIuseum.]
Goody Blake and Harry Gill.-WonDSWORII1.
OH! what's the matter? what's the matter?
What is't that ails young Harry Gill?
That evermore his teeth they chatter,
Chatter, chatter, chatter still.
COf waistcoats Harry has no lack,
Good duffle gray, and flannel fine;
He has a blanket on his back,
And coats enough to smother nine.
In March, December, and in July,'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;
The neighbors tell, and tell you truly,
His teeth they chatter, chatter still.
At night, at morning, and at noon,'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;
Beneath the sun, beneath the moon,
His teeth they chatter, chatter still.
Young Harry was a lusty drover,
And who so stout of limb as he?
His cheeks were red as ruddy clover,
His voice was like the voice of three.
Auld Goody Blake was old and poor,
Ill fed she was, and thinly clad;
And any mah who passed her door,
Might see how poor a hut she bad.
All day she spun in her poor dwelling,
And then her three hours' work at night!
Alas!'twas hardly worth the telling,
It would not pay for candle-light.

--This woman dwelt in Dorsetshire,
Her hut was on a cold hill side,
And in that country coals are dear,
For they come far by wind and tide.
By the same fire to boil their pottage,
Two poor old dames, as I have known,
WTill often live in one small cottage,
But she, poor woman, dwelt alone.'Twas well enough when summer came,
The long, warm, lightsome summer day,
Then at her door the canty dame
Would sit, as any linnet gay.
But when the ice our streams did fetter,
Oh! then how her old bones w6uld shake!
You would have said if you had met her,'Twas a hard time for Goody Blake.
Her evenings then were dull and dread;
Sad case it was, as you may think,
For very cold to go to bed,
And then for cold not sleep a wink.
Oh joy for her! whene'er in winter,
The winds at night had made a rout,
And scattered many a lusty splinter,
And many a rotten bough about.
Yet never had she, well or sick,
As every man who knew her says,
A pile before hand, wood or stick,
Enough to warm her, for three days.
Now when the frost was past enduring,
And made her poor old bones to ache,
Could any thing be more alluring,
Than an old hedge to Goody Blake?
And now and then it must be said,
When her old bones were cold and chill,
She left her fire, or left her bed,
To seek the hedge of Harry Gill.
Now Harry he had long suspected
This trespass of old Goody Blake,
And vow'd that she should be detected,
And he on her would vengeance take.

[Lesson 63.And oft frbm his warm fire he'd go,
And to the fields his road would take,
And there, at night, in frost and snow,
He watch'd to seize old Goody Blake.
And once behind a rick of barley,
Thus looking out did Harry stand;
The moon was full, and shining clearly,
And crisp with frost the stubble land.
-He hears a noise-he's all awakeAgain!--on tiptoe down the hill
He softly creeps--'Tis Goody Blake!
She's at the hedge of Harry Gill.
Right glad was he when he beheld her:
Stick after stick did Goody pull,
He stood behind a bush of elder,
Till she had fill'd her apron full.
When with her load she turn'd about,
The by-road back again to take,
He started forward with a shout,
And sprang upon poor Goody Blake.
And fiercely by the arm he took her,
And by the arm he held her fast,
And fiercely by the arm he shook her,
And cried, "I've caught you then at last!
Then Goody, who had nothing said,
Her bundle from her lap let fall;
And kneeling on the sticks, she.pray'd,
To God that is the judge of all.
She pray'd, her wither'd hand uprearing,
While Harry held her by the arm"God! who art never out of hearing,
0 may he never more be warm!"
The cold, cold moon above her head,
Thus on her knees did Goody pray,
Young Harry heard what she had said,
And icy cold he turrn'd away.
He went complaining all the morrcw
That he was cold and very chill:
His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow
Alas that day for Harry Gill!

Like a loose casement in the wind.
And Harry's fleshl it fell away;
And all who see him say'tis plain,
That live as long as live he may,
He never will be warm again.
No word to any man he utters,
Abed or up, to young or old;

LESSON LXIV.
Suypposed feelings of Aidan on being called into existence.*--
BUFFON.
I REMEMBER the moment when my existence commenced:
it was a moment replete with joy, amazement, and anxiety.
I neither knew what I was, where I was, nor from whence
I came. I opened my eyes; what an increase of sensation!
The light, the celestial vault, the verdure of the earth, the
transparency of the waters, gave animation  to my spirits,
and conveyed  pleasures which  exceed  the powers of exI'ression.
* The above extract is taken from Buffon's Natural History, and contains
a ve-ry vivid dcescriptiin of the slow and painful process by. which human?)eings acquire what may be called the use anid knowledge of their,ienses.'ihe idea, that Adam had to undergo nearly the same dlscipline a, a little
cnlild, before he acquired a knowledge of himself and of that sublime creation
of which he was then the sole heir, is, of course, altogether imaginiary, and
merely assumed for the purpose of illustration.
150
LLesson 64.
THE AMERICANI at first believed that all these objects existed within me,
and formed a part of myself. When totally absorbed in this
idea, I turned my eyes to the sun: his splendor overpowered me. I voluntarily shut out the light, and felt a slight
degree of pain. During this moment of darkness, 1 imagined
that I had lost the greatest part of my being.
When reflecting, with grief and astonishment, upon this
great change, I was roused with a variety of sounds. The
singing of birds, and the murmuring of the breezes, formed
a concert which excited the most sweet and enchanting
emotions. I listened long, and was convinced that these
harmonious sounds existed within me.
Totally occupied with this new spccies of existence, I had
already forgot the light, though the first part of my being
that I had rec'ognised. I again, by accident, opened my
eyes, and was delighted to find myself recover the possession of so many brilliant objects. This pleasure surpassed
every former sensation, and suspended, for a time, the
charming melody of sound.                  4
I fixed my eyes on a thousand objects; I soon perceived
that I had the power of losing and of recovering them, and
that I could, at pleasure, destroy and renew this beautiful
part of my existence.
I could now see without astonishment, and hear without
anxiety, when a gentle breeze wafted perfumes to my nostrils. This new and delightful sensation agitated my frame,
and gave a fresh addition to my self-love.
Totally occupied by all these sensations, and loaded with
pleasures so delicate and so extensive, I suddenly arose, and
was transported by the perception of an unknown power.
I had made but a single step, when the novelty of my situation rendered me immoveable. My surprise was extreme,
I thought my being fled from me: the movement I had
made confounded the objects of vision; and the whole creation seemed to be disordered.
I raised my hand to mny head; I touched my forehead
and my eyes; and I felt every part of my body. The hand
no'v appeared to be the principal organ of my existence.
The perceptions afforded by this instrument were so distinct and so perfect; the pleasures conveyed by it were so
superior to those of light and sound, that, for some time, I
attached myself entirely to this substantial part of my being,
and I perceived that my ideas began to assume a consistence
and reality which I had never before experienced.  Every

FIRST CLASS BOOK.part of my lTody, which I touched with my hand, reflected
the sensation, and produced in mri mind a double idea.
By this exercise I soon learned, that the faculty of feeling
was expanded over every part of my frame; and I began to
recognise the limits of my existence, which till now seemed
to be of an immense extent.
I surveyed my body, and I judged it to be of a size so
immense, that all other objects, in comparison, seemed to be
only luminous points. I followed my hand with my eyes,
and observed all its motions. Of all these objects my ideas
were confused and fallacious. I imagined that the motion
of my hand was a kind of fugitive existence, a mere succession of similar causes; I brought my hand near my eye; it
then seemed to be larger than my whole body; for it concealed from my view almost every other object.
I began to suspect that there was some illusion in the
sensation conveyed by the eyes. I distinctly perceived that
my hand was only a small part of my body; but I was unable to comprehend how it should appear so enormously
large, I therefore resolved to depend for information upon
the sense of feering alone, which had never deceived me,
and to be on my guard against all the other modes of sensation.
This precaution was extremely useful to me. I renewed
my motions, and walked with my face turned toward the
heavens. I struck against a palm tree, and felt a slight
degree of pain. Seized with terror, I ventured to lay my
hand upon the object, and discdvered it to be a being distinct
from myself, because it gave me not, like touching my
own body, a double sensation: I turned from it with horror, and perceived, for the first time, that there was something external, something which did not constitute a part of
my own existence.
It was with difficulty that I could reconcile myself to this
discovery; but, after reflecting on the event which had happened, I concluded that I ought to judge concerning external objects in the same manner as I had judged. concerning
the parts of my body; and the sense of feeling alone could
ascertain their existence.  I resolved, therefore, to feel
every object that I saw. I had a desire of touching the
sun; I accordingly stretched forth my hands to embrace the
heavens; but they met, without feeling any intermediate
object.
Every experiment I made served only to increase my as*
152
[Lesson 64.
TIIE AMERICANtonishment; for all objects appeared to be equally near,
and it was not till after an infinite number of trials, that I
learned to use my eye as a guide to my hand. As the hand
gave me ideas totally different from the impressions I received by the eye, my sensations were contradictory; the
judgments I formed were imperfect; and my whole existence was disorder and confusion.
Reflecting deeply on the nature of my being, the contradictions I had experienced filled me with humility: the
more I meditated, my doubts and difficulties increased.
Fatigued with so many uncertainties, and with anxious emotions which successively arose in my mind, my knees bended,
and I soon found myself in a situation of repose. This state
of tranquillity added fresh force to my senses. I was seated under the shade of a beautiful tree. Fruit of a vermilion hue hung down, in the form of grapes, within reach of
my hand.  These fruits I gently touched, and they instant!y
separated from the branch. In laying hold of one of them,
I imagined I had made a great conquest; and I rejoiced in
the faculty of containing in my hand an entire being which
made no part of myself. Its weight, though trifling, seemed
to be an animated resistance, which I had a pleasure in being able to conquer.
I held the fruit near my eyes: I examined its form and
its colors. A delicious odor allured me to bring it near
my lips, and I inhaled long draughts of its per'furnes. WThen
entirely occupied with the sweetness of its fragrance, my
mouth opened, and I discovered that I had an internal sense
of smelling, which was more delicate and refined than that
conveyed by the nostrils. In fine, I tasted the fruit. The
novelty of the sensation, and the exquisiteness of the savor,
filled me with astonishment and transport. Till now I had
only enjoyed pleasures; but taste gave me an idea of voluptuousness.  The erljoyment was so congenial and intimate,
that it conveyed to me the notion of possession or property.
I thought that the substance of the fruit had become part of
my own, and that I was endowed with the power of transforming bodies.
Charmed with this idea of power, and with the pleasures
I felt, I continued to pull and to eat. But an agreeabie:languor gradually impaired  my senses; my limbs grew
heavy.; and my mind seemed to lose its natural activity. I
perceived this inaction by the feebleness of my thoughts:
the dulness of my sensations rounded all external objects

153and conveyed only weak and ill-defined ideas. At this instant my eyes shut, and my head reclined upon the grass.
Every thing now  disappeared: darkness and confusion
reignled. The train of my ideas was interrupted; and I
lost the consciousness of my existence. My sleep was profound; but, having no mode of measuring time, I knew
nothing of its duration. My awakening appeared to be a
second birth; for I only perceived that I had ceased to exist.
This temporary annihilation gave me the idea of fear, and
made me conclude that my existence was not permanent.
Another perplexity  arose; I suspected that sleep had
robbed rile of some part of my powers: I tried my different
senses, and endeavored to recognise all my former faculties. W7hen surveying my body, in order to ascertain its
indentity, I was astonished to find at my side another form
perfectly similar to my own! I conceived it to be another
self; and, instead of losing by sleep, I imagined myself to
be doubled.
I ventured to lay my hand upon this new being: with rapture and astonishment I perceived that it was not myself,
but something much more glorious and desirable; and I
imagined that my existence was about to dissolve, and to be
wholly transfused into this second part of rny being.
I perceived her to be animated by the touch of my hand:
I saw her catch the expression in my eyes; and the lustre
and vivacity of her own made a new source of life thrill in
my veins.
At this instant the sun had finished his course; I perceived, with pain, that I lost the sense of seeing; and the present obscurity recalled in vain the idea of my former sleep.

Scottish Music;--its peculiarity accountedfor.-BEATTIE.
THE Highlands of Scotland are a picturesque, but in gene
ral a melancholy country. Long tracts of mountainous desert covered with dark heath, and often obscured by misty
weather; narrow valleys, thinly inhabited, and bounded by
precipices resounding with the fall of torrents; a soil so
rugged and a clime so dreary, as in many parts to admit
neither the amusements of pasturage, nor the labors ot
154
[Lesson 65.
THE AMERICAN1.55
agriculture; the mournful dashing of waves along the friths
and lakes that intersect the country; the portentous nroises
which every change of the wind, and every increase and
diminution of the waters are apt to raise in a lonely region,
full of echoes, and rocks, and caverns; the grotesque and
ghastly appearance of such a landscape by the light of the
moon; objects like these diffuse a gloom over the fancy,
w-hich may be compatible enough with occasional anid social
merriment, but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts even of
an ordinary native in the hour of silence and solitude.
What then woulj it be reasonable to expect from  the
fanciful tribe, from the musicians and poets, of such a region?  Strains, expressive of joy, tranquillity, or the softer
passions? No; their style must have been better suited to
their circumstances. And so we find, in fact, that their
music is. The wildest irregularity appears in its composition: the expression is warlike and melancholy, and approaches even to the terrible.-And that their poetry is
almost uniformly mournful, and their views of nature dark
and dredry, will be allowed by all who admit the authenticity of Ossian; and not doubted by any who believe those
fragments of Highland poetry to be genuine, which many
old people, now alive, of that country, remember to have
heard in their youth, and were then taught to refer to a
pretty high antiquity.
Some of the southern provinces of Scotland present a
very different prospect.  Smooth and lofty hills covered
with  verdure; clear streams winding throtugh long  and
beautiful valleys; trees produced without culture, here
straggling or single, and there crowding into little groves
and bowers; with other circumstances peculiar to the districts alluded to, render them fit for pasturage, and favorable to romantic leisure and tender passion.
Several of the old Scotch songs take their names from the
rivulets, villages, and hills adjoining to the Tweed near Melrose; a region distinguished by many charming varieties of
rural scenery, and which, whether we consider the fare of
the country or the genius of the people, may properly enough
be termed the Arcadia of Scotland. And all their songs

Fortitude of the Indian Character.-ADAIR's TRAVELS.
A PARTY of the Seneca Indians came to war against the
Katawbas, bitter enemies to each other. In the woods the
former discovered a sprightly warrior belonging to the latter, hunting in their usual light dress; on his perceiving them
he sprung off for a hollow rock four or five miles distant, as
they intercepted him  from running homeward. He was so
extremely swift and skilful with the gun, as to kill seven
of them in the running fight before they were able to
surround and take him. They carried him to their country
in sad triumph; but though he filled them with uncommon grief and shame for the loss of so many of their kindred,
yet the love of martial virtue induced them to treat him,
during their long journey, with a great deal more civility
than if he had acted the part of a coward.
The women and children, when'they met him  at their
several towns, beat him and whipped him in as severe a
manner as the occasion required, accordingr to their law of
justice; and at last he was formally condemned to die by
the fiery torture. It might reasonably be imagined, that
what he had for some time gone through, by being fed with
a scanty hand, a tedious march, lying at night on the bare
ground, exposed to the changes of the weather, with his
arms and legs extended in a pair of rough stocks, and
suffering such punishment on his entering into their hostile
towns, as a prelude to those sharp torments to which he
was destined, would have so impaired his health, and affected his imagination, as to have sent him to his long sleep, out
of the way of any more sufferings.
Probably this would have been the case with the major
part of white people under similar circumstances; but I never
knew this with any of the Indians: and this cool-hea(led,
Frave warrior,-did not deviate from their rough lessons of
martial virtue, but acted his part so well as to surprise
and sorely vex his numerous enemies:-for when they were
taking him, unpinioned, in their wild parade, to the place
of torture, which lay near to a river, he suddenly dashed
down those who stood in his way, sprung off, and plunged
into the water, swimming underneath like an otter, only risIng to take breath, till he reached the opposite shore.
He now ascended the steep bank, but, though he had good
reason to be in a hurry, as many of the enemy were in the
LLesson 66,

THE AMERICANwater, and others running, like blood-holnds, in pursuit of
him, and the bullets flying around him froIn the time he took
to the river, yet his heart did not allow him to leave them
abruptly.  He chose to take leave in a formal manner, in
return for the extraordinary favors they had done, and
intended to do him.  So, stopping a moment, to bid them
defiance, in the genuine style of Indian gallantry, he pult:ip
the shrill war-whoop, as his last salute, till some more convenient opportunity offered, and darted off in the manner of
a beast broke loose from its torturing enemies.
He continued his speed, so as to run by about midnight of
the same day as far as his eager pursuers were two days in
reaching. There he rested, till he happily discovered five
of those Indians who had pursued him:-he lay hid a little
way off their camp, till they were sound asleep. Every
circunistance of his situation occurred to him, and inspired
him with heroism. He was naked, torn, and hungry, and
his enraged enemies were come up with him; but there was
now every thing to relieve his wants, and a fair opportunity
to save his life, and get great honor and sweet revenge by
cutting them of.--Resolution, a convenient spot, and sudden
surprise, would effect the main object of all his wishes and
hopes. He accordingly crept, took one of their tomahawks,
and killed them  all on the spot-clothed himself, and took
a choice gun, and as much ammunition and provisions as
he could well carry in a running march. He set off afresh
with a light heart, and did not sleep for several successive
nights, except when he reclined as usual, a little before day,
with his back to a tree.
As it were by instinct, when he found he was free from
the pursuing enemy, he made directly to the very place
where he had been taken prisoner and doomed to the fiery
torture, after having killed seven of his enemies.  The
bodies of these he dugo up, burnt them to ashes, and went
home in safety with singular triumph.--Other pursuing
enemies caine, on the evening of the second day, to the
camp of their dead people, when the sight gave them a
greater shock than they had ever known before.  In their
chilled war council they concluded, that as he had done
(such surprising things in his defence before he was captivated, and even after that, in his naked condition, he must
surely be an enemy wizard; and that, as he was now well
armed, he would destroy them all should they continue the
pursuit;-they therefore very prudently returned home.

FIRST CLASS BOOK,LESSON LXVII.
The Widow and her Son.-WAsmHIGTON IRVING.
DtURING my residence in the couintry, I used frequently to
attend at the old village church, which stood in a country
filled with ancient families, and contained within its cold and
silent aisles,* the congregated dust of many noble generations.
Its shadowy aisles,* its mouldering monuments, its dark oaken
pannelling, all reverend with the gloom  of departed years,
seemed to fit it for the haunt of solemn meditation.  A Sunday, too, in the country, is so holy in its repose; such a
pensive quiet reigns over the face of nature, that every
restless passion is charmed down, and we feel all the natural
religion of the soul gently springing up within us:
" Sweet day, so pure, so calm, so briglit,
The bridal of' the earth and sky!-"
1 do not pretend to be what is called a devout ran; but
there are feelings that visit me in a country church, amid
the beautiful serenity of nature, which I experience no where
else; and if not a more religious, I think I am a better man
on Sunday, than on any other day of the seven.
But in this chlurch I felt myself continually thrown back
upon the world, by the frigidity and pomp of the poor worms
aro;llld me.  The only being that seemed thoroughly to
feel the humble and prostrate piety of a true Christian, was
a poor decrepit old woman, bending under the weight of
years and infirmities.  She bore the trace of something
better than abject poverty. The lingerings of decent prilde
were visible in lier appearance.  Her dress, though humble
in the extreme, was scrupulously clean.   Some trivial respect, too, had been awarded her, for she did not take her seat
among the village poor, but sat alone on the steps of the
altar. She seemed to have survived all love, all friendship,
all society; and to have nothing left her but the hopes of
heaven.   When I saw  her feebly rising and bending her
aged form  in prayer-habitually conning her prayer-book,
which her palsied hand and failing eyes would not permit
her to read, but which she evidently knew  by heart-I felt
persuaded that the faltering voice of that poor woman arose
to Heaven far before the responses of the clerk,t the esvell
of the organ, or the chanting of the choir.t
I am fond of loitering about country chuirches, and this
was s; ueiightt-uiiy situated, that it frequently attracted me.

T Pron. l kwIre.It stood on a Knoll, round which a stream made a beautiful
bend, and then wound its way through a long reach of soft
meadow  scenery.  The church'was surrounded by yew
trees, which seemed almost coeval with itself.  Its tall
Gothic spire shot up li(ghtly from among them, with rooks
and crows generally wheeling about it.  I was seated there
one still, sunny morning, watching two laborers who were
digging a grave.-They had chosen one of the most remote
and neglected corners of the church-yard; where, from the
number of nameless graves around, it would appear that the
indigent and friendless were huddled into the earth.  I was
told that the new-made grave was for the only son of a poor
widow.
While I was meditating on the distinctions of worldly
rank, which extenld thus down into the very dust, the toll
of the bell announced the approach of the funeral.  They
were the ob'sequies of poverty, with which pride had nothing to do. A coffin of the plainest materials, without pall
or other covering, was borne by some of the villagers. l'he
sexton walked before with an air of cold indifference. There
were no mock mourners in the trappings of affected wo;
but there was one real mourner who feebly tottered after the
corpse. It was the aged mother of the deceased-the poor
old -woman whom I had seen seated on the steps of the altar.
She was supported by an humnble friend, who was endeavoring to comfort her. A few of the neighboring poor had
joined the train, and some children of the village were run.
ning hand in hand, now shouting with unthinking mirth,
and now pausing to gaze, with childish curiosity, on the
grief of the mourner.
As the funeral train approached the grave, the parson issued from the church porch, arrayed in the surplice, with
prayer-book in hand, and attended by the clerk.*  The service, however, was a mere act of charity.  The deceasedl
had been destitute, and the survivor was pennyless.  It was
shuffled through, therefore, in form, but coldly and unfeelingly. The well-fed priest moved but a few steps from tile
church door; his voice could scarcely be heard at the
grave; and never did I hear the funeral service, that sublime
and touching ceremony, turned into such a frigid mummery
of words.
I approached the grave.  The coffin was placed on the
ground.  On it was inscribed the name and age of the
deceased--" George Somers, aged 26 years." The poor

FIRST CLASS BOOK.mother had been assisted to kneel down at the head of it.
Her withered hands were clasped as if in prayer, but I
could perceive, by a feeble rocking of the body, and a convulsive motion of the lips, that she was gazing on the last
relics of her son, with the yearnings of a mother's heart.
The service being  ended, preparations were made to
deposit the coffin in the earth.  There was that bustling
stir which breaks so harshly on the feelings of grief and
affection: directions given in the cold tones of btusiness; the
striking of spades into sand and gravel; which, at the grave
of those we love, is, of all sounds, the most withering.  The
bustle around seemed to waken the mother from a wretched
reverie.  She raised her glazed eyes, and looked about with
a faint wildness.  As the men approached with cords to lower
the coffin into the grave, she wrung her hands and broke
into an agony of grief. The poor woman who attended her
took her by the arm, endeavoring to raise her from  the
earth, and to whisper something like consolation--" Nay,
now-nay, now-don't take it so sorely to heart."   She
could only shake her head, and wring her hands, as one not
to be comforted.
As they lowered the body into the earth, the creaking of
the cords seemed to agonize her; but when, on some accidental obstruction, there was a justling of the coffin, all the
tenderness of the mother burst forth; as if any harm could
come to him  who was far beyond the reach of worldly
suffering.
I could see no more--mrny heart swelled into my throatmy eyes filled with tears--I felt as if I were acting a barbarous part in standing by and gazing idly on this scene of
maternal anguish. I wandered to another part of the churchyard, where I remained until the funeral train had dispersed.
When I saw the mother slowly and painfully qulitting the
grave, leaving behind her the remains of all that was dear
to her on earth, and returnin(g to silence and destitution, my
heart ached for her.  What, thought I, are the distresses of
the rich! they have friends to sooth-pleasures to beguilea world to divert and dissipate their griefs.  What are the
sorrows of the young! Their growing minds soon close
above the wound-their elastic spirits soon rise beneath
the pressure-their green and ductile affections soon twine
round new objects.  But the sorrows of the poor, who have
no outward appliances to sooth-the sorrows of the aged,
with whom life at best i; but a wintry dav, and who can

aged, solitary, destitute, mourning over an only son, the
last solace of her years; these are indeed sorrows which
make us feel the im'potency of consolation.
LESSON LXVIII.
The same-concluded.
IT was some time before I left the church-yard. On my
way homeward, I met with the woman who had acted as
comforter: she was just returning from  accompanying the
mother to her lonely habitation, and I drew from her some
particulars connected with the affecting scene I had witnessed.
The parents of the deceased had resided in the village
from childhood. They had inhabited one of the neatest
cottages, and by various rural occupations, and the assistance
of a small garden, had supported themselves creditably and
comfortably, and led a happy and a blameless life. They
had one son, who had grown up to be the staff and pride of
their age.-" Oh, sir!" said the good woman, " he was such
a likely lad, so sweetly tempered, so kind to every one
round him, so dutiful to his parents! It did one's heart good
to see him of a Sunday, drest out in his best, so tall, so straight,
so cheery, supporting his old mother to church-for she was
always fonder of leaning on George's arm  than on her
goodman's; and, poor soul, she might well be proud of
him, for a finer lad there was not in the country round."
Unfortunately, the son was tempted, during a year of
scarcity and agricultural hardship, to enter into the service
of one of the small craft that plied on a neighboringr river.
He had not been long in this employ, when he was entrarped by a press-gang and carried off to sea. His parents
received tidings of his seizure, but beyond that they could
learn nothing. It was the loss of their main prop. The
father, who was already infirm, grew heartless and melancholy, and sunk into his grave. The widow, left lonely in
her age and feebleness, could no longer support herself,
and came upon the parish.  Still there was a kind feeling
toward her throughout the village, and a certain respect, as
being one of the oldest inhabitants. As no one applied for
the cottage in which she had passed so many happy days,
14*'Iesson 6S.j'
FIRST CLASS BOOK.
161she wat pernlitted to remain in it, where she lived solitary
and almost helpless. The few wants of nature were chiefl'y
supplied from the scanty productions of her little garden,
which the neighbors would now and then cultivate for her.
It was but a few days before the time at which these circumstances were told me, that she was gathering some vegeLables for her repast, when she heard the cottage-door which
faced the garden suddenly opened. A stranger came out,
and seemed to be looking eagerly and wildly around. He
was dressed in seaman's clothes, was emaciated and ghastly
pale, and bore the air of one broken by sickness and hardships. He saw her, and hastened toward her, but his steps
were faint and faltering; he sank on his knees before her,
and sobbed like a child. The poor woman gazed upon him
with a vacant and wandering eye-"Oh my dear, dear
mother! don't you know your son! your poor boy George!"
It was, indeed, the wreck of her once noble lad; who, shattered by wounds, by sickness, and foreign imprisonment,
had, at length, dragged his wasted limbs homeward, to
repose among the scenes of his childhood.
I will not attempt to detail' the particulars of such a
meeting, where joy and sorrow were so completely blended:
still he was alive! he was come home! he might yet live
to comfort and cherish her old age! Nature, however, was
exhausted in him; and if any thing had been wanting to
finish the work of fate, the desolation of his native cottage
would have been sufficient. He stretched himself on the
pallet on which his widowed mother had passed many a
sleepless night, and he never rose from it again.
The villagers, when they heard that George Somers had
returned, crowded to see him, offering every comfort and
assistance that their humble means afforded.-He was too
weak, however, to talk-he could only look his thanks.
His mother was his constant attendant; and he seemed
unwilling to be helped by any other hand.
There is something in sickness that breaks down the
pride of manhood; that softens the heart, and brings it
back to the feelings of infancy. Who that has languished,
even in advanced life, in sickness and despondency; who
that has pined on a weary bed, in the neglect and loneliness of a foreign land; but has thought on the mother " that
looked on his childhood," that smoothed his pillow, and
administered to his helplessness? Oh! there is an enduring
tenderness in the love of a mother to a son that transcends
162
THE AMERICAN
[Lesson 68al: the other affections of the heart. It is neither to be
chilled by selfishness, nor daunted by danger, nor weakened
by worthlessness, nor stifled by ingratitude. She will sacrifice every comfort to his convenience; she will surrender
every pleasure to his enjoyment; she will glory in his fame,
and exult in his prosperity:--and, if adversity overtake him,
he will be the dearer to her by misfortune; and if disgrace
settle upon his name, she will still love and cherish him;
and, if all the world beside cast him off, she will be all the
world to him.
Poor George Somers had known well what it was to be in
sickness, and have none to sooth-lonely and in prison, and
none to visit him. He could not endure his mother from
his sight; if she moved away, his eye would follow her.
She would sit for hours by his bed, watching him  as he
slept. Sometimes he would start from a feverish dream,
and look anxiously up until he saw her venerable form
bending over him; when he would take her hand, lay it
on his bosom, and fall asleep with the tranquillity of a child.
In this way he died.
My first impulse, on hearing this humble tale of affliction,
was to visit the cottage of the mourner, and administer
pecuniary assistance, and, if possible, comfort. I found,
however, on inquiry, that the good feelings of the villagers
had prompted them to do every thing that the case admitted; and as the poor know best how to console each other's
sorrows, I did not venture to intrude.
The next Sunday I was at the village church; when, to
my surprise, I saw the old womanw tottering down the aisle
to her accustomed seat on the steps of the altar.
She had made an effort to put on something like mourning for her son; and nothing could be more touching than
this struggle between pio-us affection and utter peverty: a
black riband* or so-a faded black handkerchief, and one
or two more such humble attempts to express by outward
signs that grief which passes show. When I loolked round
upon the storied monuments; the stately hatchments; the
cold marble pomp, with which grandeur mourned magnificently over departed pride; and turned to this poor widow,
bowed down by age and sorrow at the altar of her God,
and offering up the prayers and praises of a pious, though
a broken heart, I felt that this living monument of real grief
was worth them all.
I related her story to some of the wealthy members of the

Lesson 68.]congregation, and they were moved by it. They exerted
themselves to render her situation more comfortable, and to
lighten her afflictions. It was, however, but smoothingc a
few steps to the grave. In the course of a Sunday or two
after, she was missed from her usual seat at church, and
before I left the neighborhood, I heard, with a feeling of
satisfaction, that she had quietly breathed her last, and
gone to rejoin those she loved, in that world where sorrow is
never known, and friends are never parted.

A devotional spirit recommended to the young.-CAPPE.
DEVOTION is a delicate and tender plant: as much as
it is our duty and our interest to be possessed of it, it is not
easily acquired, neither can it be carelessly maintaiiled.*  It
must be long tended, diligently cultivated, and affectionately
cherished, before it will have struck its roots so deep as to
grow up and flourish in our hearts; and all along, till it attains to its perfect vigor and maturity in heaven, it needs
to be defended from the adverse influences of things seen
and temporal, of a vain imagination and an earthly mind.
The best season for acquiring the spirit of devotion is in
early life; it is then attained with the greatest facility, and
at that season there are peculiar motives for the cultivation
of it. Would you make sure of giving unto God his right,
and of rendering to the great Creator and Governor of the
world the glory due unto his name, begin to do it soon; before the glittering vanities of life have dazzled and enslaved
your imagination, before the sordid interests, of this world
have gotten possession of your soul, before the habits of
ambition, or of avarice, or of voluptuousness, or of dissipation, have enthralled you; while your minds are yet free,
and your hearts yet tender, present thenm unto God.
It will be a sacrifice superlatively acceptable iunto him, and
not less advantageous to yourselves.  Beseech him that he
will awaken in you every sentiment of piety; beseech him
tat he will direct and prosper your endeavors to acquire,

THERE is an " even tide" in the year,--a season, as we
now witness, when the sun withdraws his propitious light,vwhen the winds arise, and the leaves fall, and nature around
us seems to sink into decay. It is said, in general, to be the
season of melancholy; and if, by this word, be meant that it
is the time of solemn and of serious thought, it is undoubtedly the season of melancholy;--vet, it is a melancholy so
soothing, so gentle in its approach, and so prophetic in its
influence, that they, who have known it, feel, as if instinctively, that it is the doing of God, and that the heart of man is
not thus finely touched, but to fine issues.
1. It is a season, which tends to wean us from the passions
of the world. Every passion, however base or unworthy,
is yet eloquent.  It speaks to us of present enjoyment;it tells us of what men have done, and what men may do,
and it supports us every where by the example of many
around us  When we go out into the fields in the even166

[Lesson 71.ing of the ymar, a different voice approaches us.  WVe regard, even in spite of ourselves, the still but steady advances of time,
A few days ago, and the summer of the year was grateful,
and every element was filled with life, and the sun of
Heaven seemed to glory in his ascendant. He is now enfeebled'n his power; the desert no more "blossoms like
the rose;" the song of joy is no more hleard among the
branches; and the earth is strewed* with that f6liage which
once bespoke the magnificence of summer.  Whatever may
be the passions which society has awakened, we pause,
amid this apparent desolation of nature.  We sit down in
the lodge " of the way-faring man in the wilderness," and
we feel that all we witness is the emblem of our own fate.
Such also, in a few years, will be our own condition.  The
blossoms of our spring,-the pride of our summer will also
fade into decay;--and the pulse that now beats high with
virtuous or with vicious desire, will gradually sink, and then
must stop forever.
We rise from  our meditations with hearts softened and
subdued, and we return into life as into a shadowy scene,
where we have "disquieted ourselves in vain."  Such is
the first impression which the present scene of nature is
fitted to make upon us.  It is this first impression which
intimidates the thoughtless and the gay; and, indeed, if
there were no other reflections that followed, I know not
that it would be the business of wisdom to recorrmmend such
meditations.  It is the -onsequences, however, of such previous thoughts, which are chiefly valuable; and among these
there are two which may well deserve our consideration.
2. It is the peculiar character of the melanlcholy which
such seasons excite, that it is general.  It is not an individual remonstrance;-it is not the harsh language of human
wisdom, which too often insults, while it instructs us.  When
the winds of autumn sigh around us, their voice speaks not
to us only, but to our kind; and the lesson they teach us is
not that we alone decay, but that siuch also is the fate of all
the generations of m;in.-" They are the green leaves of the
tree of the desert, which perish and are renewed."
Irn such a sentiment there is a kind of sublimity mingled
with its melancholy;-our tears fall, but they fall not for
ourse.ves;-and, although the train of our thoughts may
have begun with the selfishness of our own concerns, we
feel that, by the ministry of some mysterious power, they

167end in awakening our concern for every being that lives.Yet a few years, we think, and all that now bless, or all
that now convulse humanity will also have perished. The
rightiest pageantry* of life will pass,-the loudest notes cf
triumph or of conquest will be silent in the grave;--the
wiclied, wherever active, " will cease from  troubling," and
the weary, wherever suffering, "w -ill be at rest."
under an impression so profournd, we feel our own hearts
better.  The cares, tfie animosities, the hatreds which society may have engendered, sink  unperceived from  our
bosoms.  In the genleral desolation of nature, we feel the
littleness of our own passions;-we look forward to that
kcindred evening which time must bring to all;--we articipate the graves of those we hate, as of those we love.
Every unkind passion falls, with the leaves that fall around
us; and we return slowly to our homes, and to the society
which surrounds us, with the wish only to enlighten or to
bless them.
3. If there were no other effects of such appearances of
nature upon our minds, they would still be vaiuable,-they
would teach us humility,-and with it they would teach us
charity.  In the same hour in which they taught us our own
fr'agility, they would teach us commiseration for the whole
family of man.-But there is a farther sentiment which
such scenes inspire, more valuable than all; and we know
little the designs of Providence, when we do not yield ourselves in such hours to the beneficent instincts of our imagination.
It is the unvarying character of nature, amid all its scenes,
to lead us at last to its Author; and it is for this final end
that all its varieties have such dominion upon our minds.
We are led by the appearances of spring to see his bounty;.
and we are led by the splendors of summer to see his greatness. In the present hours, we are led to a higher sentiment; and, what is most remarkable, the very circumstances of melancholy are those which guide us most securely to
put our trust in him.
We are witnessing the decay of the year;--we go back
in imagination, and find that such, in every generation, has
been the fate of man;--we look forward, and we see that
to such ends all must come at last;-we lift our desponding
eyes in search of comfort, and we see above us, One, " who
is ever the same, and to whose years there is no end."
Amid the vicissitudes of nature, we discover that central
*Prcn. pAd'-j,ln-tre.
168
[Lesson 71,
THE AMERICANmajesty "in whom there is no variableness nor shadow cf
turning." We feel that there is a God; and from the tempestuous sea of life, we hail that polar star of nature, to
which a sacred instinct had directed our eyes, and wh-ich
burns with undecaying ray to lighten us among all the dark
ncess of the deep.
From this great conviction, there is another sentimert
which succeeds.  Nature, indeed, yearly perishes; but it is
yearly renewed. Amid all its changes, the immortal spirit
of H im that made it remains; and the same sun which now
marks with his receding ray the autumn of the year, will
again arise in his brightness, and bring along with him the
promise of the spring and all the magnificence of summer.
Under such convictions, hope dawns upon the sadness of
the heart. The melancholv of decay becomes the very
herald of renewal;--the magnificent circle of nature opens
upon our view;--we anticipate the analogous resurrection
of our being;--we see beyond the grave a greater spring,
and we people it with those who have given joy to that
which is passed.  With such final impressions, we submit
olurselves gladly to the destiny of our being. While the sun
of mortality sinks, we hail the risingo of the Sun of Righteousness, and, in hours when all the honors of nature are perishing around us, we prostrate ourselves in deeper adoration
before Him who "sitteth upon its throne."
Let, then, the young go out, in these hours, under the
descending sun of the year into the fields of nature. Their
hearts are no-w ardent with hope,-with the hopes of fame,
of honor, or of happiness; and in the long perspec'tive
which is before them, their imagination creates a world
where all may be enjoyed.  Let the scenes which they
now may witness, moderate, but not extinguish their ambition:-while they see the yearly desolation of nature, let
them see it as the emblem of mortal hope;-while they feel
the disproportion between the powers they possess, and the
time they are to be employed, let them carry their ambitious
eve beyond the world;--and while, in these sacred solitudes,
a voice in their own bosom corresponds to the voice of decaying nature, let them take that high decision which becomes
those who feel themselves the inhabitants of a greater world,
and who look to a being incapable of decay.

GILBEIrT AINSLIE was a poor man; and he had been a poor
man all the days of his life, which were not few, for his thin
hair was now waxing gray.  He had been born and bred on
the small moorland farm which he now occupied; and he
hoped to die there, as his father and grandfather had done
before him, leaving a family just above the  mrore  bitter
wants of this world.  Labor, hard and unremitting, had
been his lot in life; but although sometimes severely tried,
he had never repined; and througil all the mist, and gloom,
and even thle storms that had assailed himn, he had lived on,
from  year to year, in that calm  and resigned contentment,
which unconsciously cheers the hearth-stone of the blameless poor.'With his own hands he had ploughed, sowed, and reaped
his often scanty harvest, assisted, as they grew up, by three
sons, who, even in boyhood, were happy to work along with
their father in the fields.  Out of doors or in, Gilbert Ainslie
was never idle.  The spade, the shears, the plough-shaft,
the sickle, and the flail, all came readily to hands that
grasped them  well; and not a morsel of food was eaten
under his roof, or a garment worn there, that was not honestly, severely, nobly earned.  Gilbert Ainslie was a slave,
but it was for them he loved with a sober and, deep affection.
The thraldom under which he lived God had imposed, and
it only served to give his character a shade of silent gravity,
but not- austere; to make his smiles fewer, but more heartfelt; to calm his soul at grace before and after meals; and
to kindle it in morning al'd evening prayer.
There is no need to tell the character of the wife of sucli
a man.  Meek and thoughtful, yet gladsome and gay withal,
her heaven was in her house; and her gentler and weaker
lhands helped to bar the door against want.  Of ten children
that had been born to them, they had lost three; and as
they had fed, clothed, and educated them  respectably, so
did tlhey give them  who died a respectable funeral.  Thle
livirng did not grudge to give up, for a while, some of their

the little sums which their industry had saved, decent mourn/ngs, worn on Sabbath, and then carefully laid by.  Of the
seven that survived, two sons were farm-servants in the
neighborhood, while three daughters and two sons remained
at home, growing, or grown up, a small, happy, hardworking
household.
Many cottages are there in Scotland like Moss-side, and
many such humble and virtuous cottagers as were now beneath its roof of straw.  The eye of the passing traveller
may mark them, or mark them not, but they stand peacefully in thousands over all the land; and most beautiful do
they make it, through all its wide valleys and narrow glens,
-its low holms encircled by the rocky walls of some bonny
burn,-its green mounts elated with their little crowning
groves of plane trees,--its vellow cornfields,-its bare, pastoral hiil-sides, and all its heathy moors, on whose black
bosom lie shining or concealed glades of excessive verdure,
inhabited by flowers, and visited only by the far-flying bees.
Moss-side was not beautiful to a careless or hasty eye;
but when looked on and surveyed, it seemed a pleasant
dwelling.  Its roof, overgrown with grass and moss, was
almost as green as the ground out of which its weatherstained walls appeared to grow.  The moss behind it was
separated from a little garden, by a narrow slip of arable
land, the dark color of which showed that it had been won
from the wild by patient industry, and by patient industry
retained.  It required a bright sunny day to make Moss-side
fair; but then it was fair indeed; and when the little brown
moorland birds were singing their short sbngs among the
rushes and the heather, or a lark, perhaps lured- thither by
some green barley field for its undisturbed nest, rose ringing
all over the enlivened solitude, the little bleak farm smiled like
the paradise of poverty, sad and affecting in its lone and
extreme simplicity.
The boys and girls had made some plots of flowers among
the -vegetables that the little garden supplied for their homely
meals; pinks and carnations, brourght from walled gardens
of rich men farther down in the cultivated strath, grew
here with somewhat diminished lustre; a bright show of
tulips had a strange beauty in the midst of that moor-land;

Lesson 72.]
171In this cottage, Gilbert's youngest child, a girl about nine
years of age, had been lying for a week in a fever. It was
now Saturday evening, and the ninth day of the disease.
Was she to live or die?  It seemed as if a very few hours
were between the innocent creature and Heaven. All the
symptoms were those of approaching death.  The parenls
knew well the change that comes over the human face,
whether it be in infancy, youth, or prime, just before the
departure of the spirit; and as they stood together by Margaret's bed, it seemed to them  that the fatal shadow hal
fallen upon her features.
The surgeon of the parish lived somle miles distant, but
they expected him now every moment, and many a wistful
look was directed by tearful eyes along the moor. The
daughter, who was out at service, came anxiously home on
this night, the only one that could be allowed her, for the
poor must work in their grief, and hired servants must do
their duty to those whose bread they eat, even when nature
is sick,-sick at heart. Another of the daughters came in
from the potato-field beyond the brae, with what wLas to be
their frugal supper. The calm, noiseless spirit of life was
in and around the house, while death seemed dealing with
one who, a few days ago, was like light upon the floor, and
the sound of music, that always breathed up when most
wanted; glad and joyous in common talk,-sweet, silvery,
and mournful, when it joined in hymn or psalm.
One after the other, they all continued going up to the
bed-side, and then coming away sobbing or silent, to see their
merry little sister, who used to keep dancing all day lilce a
butterfly in a meadow field, or like a butterfly with shut
wings on a flower, trifling for a while in the silence of her
joy, now tossing restlessly on her bed, and scarcely sensible
to the words of endearment whispered around her, or the
kisses dropt with tears, in spite of themselves, on her burning
forehead.
Utter poverty often kills the affections; but a deep. constant, and common feeling of this world's hardships, and an
equal participation in all those struggles by which they may
be softened, unite husband and wife, parents and children,
brothers and sisters, in thoughtful and subdued tenderness,
making them happy indeed while the circle round the fire
is unbroken, and yet preparing them every day to bear the
separation, when some one or other is taken slowly or sud.

[Lesson 72.
THE AMERICANalthough, incideed, nature sometimes will wrestle with necessity; and there is a wise moderation both in the joy and the
grief of the intelligent poor, which keeps lasting trouble
away from their earthly lot, and prepares them silently and
unconsciously for Heaven.
" Do you think the child is dying?" said Gilbert with a
calm voice to the surgeon, who, on his wearied horse, had
just arrived from another sick-bed, over the misty range of
hills; and had been looking steadfastly for some minutes on
the little patient.  The humane man knew the family well,
in the midst of whom he was standing, and replied, " While
there is life there is hope; but my pretty little Margaret is, I
fear, in the last extremity."  There was no loud lamentation
at these words-all had before known, though they would
not confess it to themselves, what they now were told--and
though the certainty that was in the words of the skilful man
made their hearts beat for a little with sicker throbbings,
made their pale faces paler, and brought out from  some
eyes a greater gush of tears; yet death had been before in
this house, and in this case he came, as he always does, in
awe, but not in terror.
There were wandering, and wavering, and dreamy deli ious
phantasies in the brain of the innocent child; but the few
words she indistinctly uttered were affecting, not rending to
the heart, for it was plain that she thought herself herding
her sheep in the green, silent pastures, and sitting wrapped
in her plaid upon the sunny side of the Birk-knowe.  She
was too much exhausted-there was too little life-too little
breath in her heart, to frame a tune; but some of her words
seemed to be from favorite old songs; and at last her mother
wept, and turned aside her face, when the child, whose blue
eyes were shut, and her lips almost still, breathed out these
lines of the beautiful twenty-third psalm:
The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green: he leadeth me
The quiet waters by.
The child was now left with none but her mother by the
)bed-side, for it was said to be best so; and Gilbert and his
family sat down round the kitchen fire, for a while, in silence.
In about a qularter of an hour, they began to rise calmly,
and to go each to his allotted work. One of the daughters
went forth with the pail to milk the cow, and another began

173
Lesson 72.]
FIRST CLASS BOOK.to set out the table in the middle of the floor for supper,
covering it with a white cloth.  Gilbert viewed the usual
household arrangements with a solemn and untroubled eye;
and there was almost the faint light of a grateftll smile
on his cheek, as he said to the worthy surgeon, "You will
partake of our fare after your day's travel and toil of humanity."
In a short, silent half hour, the potatoes and oat-cakes,
butter and milk were on the board; and Gilbert, lifting up
his toil-hardened, but manly hand, with a slow motion, at
which the room  was as hushed as if it had been empty,
closed his eyes in reverence, and asked a blessing.  There
was a little stool, on which no one sat, by the old man's
side.  It had been put there unwittingly, when the other
seats were all placed in their usual order; but the golden
head that was wont to rise at that part of the table was
now wanting.  There was silence-not a word was saidtheir meal was before them,-God had been thanked, and
they began to eat.
LESSON LXXIII.
The same-concluded.
WMHILE they were at their silent meal, a horseman came
galloping to the door, and, with a loud voice, called out
that he had been sent express with a letter to Gilbert
Ainslie; at the same time rudely, and with an oath, demanding a dram for his trouble.  The eldest son, a lad of eighteen,
fiercely seized the bridle of his horse, and turned his head
away from the door.  The rider, somewhat alarmed at the
flushed face of the powerful stripling, threw down the letter
and rode off.
Gilbert took the letter from his son's hand, casting, at
the same time, a half upbraiding look on his face, that was
returning to its former color. "I feared,"--said the youth,
w'th a tear in his eye,-" I feared that the brute's voice,
and the trampling of the horse's feet would have disturbed
her." Gilbert held the letter hesitatingly in his hand, as if
afraid, at that moment, to read it; at leiigth, he said aloud
to the surgeon: "You know that I am a poor man, and debt,
if justly incurred, and punctually paid when due, is no disTHE AMERICAN
174
[Lesson 73,honor." Both his hand and his voice shook slightly as he
spoke; but he opened the letter from the lawyer, and
read it in silence.
At this moment his wife came from her child's bed-side,
and looking anxiously at her husband, told him  "nct to
mind about the money, that no man, who knev him, would
arrest his goods, or put him into prison.  Though, dear me,
it is cruel to be put to it thus, when our bairn* is dyingr, and
when, if so it be the Lord's will, she should have a decent
burial, poor innocent, like them  that went before her."
Gilbert continued reading the letter with a face on which
no motion could be discovered; and then, folding it up, he
gave it to his wife, told her she might read it if she chose,
and then put it into his desk in the room, beside the poor
dear bairn.  Shle took it from  him, without reading it, and
crushed it into her bosom; for she turned her ear towards
her child, and, thilnking she heard it stir, ran out hastily to
its bed-side.
Another hour of trial past, and the child was still swimming for its life.  The very dogs knew there was grief in
the house, and lay without stirring, as if hidingr themselves,
below the long table at the window.  One sister sat with an
unfinished gown on her knees, that she had been sewingt
for the dear child, and still continued at the hopeless work,
she scarcely knew why; and often, often, putting up her
hand to wipe away a tear.  "What is that?" said the old
man to his eldest daughter: "What is that you are laying
on the shelf?"  She could scarcely reply that it was a riband and an ivory comb that she had brought for little Margaret, against the night of the dancing-school ball.
And, at these words, the father could not restrain a long,
deep, and bitter groan; at which the boy, nearest in age to
his dying sister, looked up, weeping in his face, and letting
the tattered book of old ballads, which he had been poring
on, but not reading, fall out of his hainds, he rose froin his
seat, and, going into his father's bosom, kissed him, and
asked God to bless him; for the holy heart of the boy was
moved within him; and the old man, as he e-nbraced him,
felt that, in his innocence and simplicity, he was indeed a
comforter.  " The Lord giveth, alnd the Lord talieth away,"
said the old man; " blessed. e tbhe name of the Lord."

to keep alive, and to improve, the genuine spirit of devotion.
Entreat him that he will give you to behold himself in whatever else you see, and to discern his providence in all the
events that you observe, or that you experience. Put your
hearts into his hands, and importune him, (if importunity it
can be called,) to lay them open unto all the blessed influences of the discoveries he has made of himself and of his
will, in his works, or in his ways, or in his word.  Implore
him to give you and preserve to you, the liveliest sensibihfty
to all things spiritual and divine; and while thus you ask it,
seek for it, in the conscientiousx use of the appointed means
of grace, and by every method that intelligence and prudence and experience recommend to you.
Let it be a perpetual object with you every day, to be improving in this heavenly temper. The spirit of devotion will
be very hard to kindle in the frozen bosom of old age, and
not very easy to introduce through the giddy heads into the
busy hearts of manhood or advanced youth. If you wish
then to reach that better world, where devotion;, pure and
ardent, is one of the most striking characters of its inhabitants, and, at the same time, one of the most essential ingredients in the happiness that they enjoy, you cannot be
too early, and you cannot be too constant, in your endeavors to acquire and maintaint the spirit of devotion.
It is an acquisition well worth all that it can cost you to
attain it: for if the genuine spirit of devotion occupies your
heart, it will preserve you from  the corruptions that are in
the world; it will give you courage to be singular, when to
do your duty it will be necessary to be singular; it will
malke all your duties easy, and most of them it will make
pleasant to you; it will shed the sweetest light upon the
pleasing scenes and incidents of life, and will diffuse its
cheering rays even over the darkest and most gloomy.
The pleasures that you may take will be infinitely more
enjoyed by you, if God, the Author of them, has possession
of your hearts; and the pains you cannot shun will be far
less grievous to you, if God, who maketh darkness and createth evil be regarded by you as the wise and kind Dispenser of your lot.  "Remember," then, while you are yet
entering upon life, "' remember your Creator in the days of
your youth, before the evil day comes, and the years draw
nigh, in which ye shall say, I have no pleasure in them."

the minister of Auchindown never left his Manse,* except,
as now, to visit the sick or dying bed.  Scarcely could
Gilbert reply to his first question about his child, when the
surgeon camne from  the  bed-room, and said, " Margaret
seems lifted up by God's hand above death and the grave:
I think she will recover.  She has failen asleep; and when
srLe wakes, I hope-I believe-that the danger will be past,
and that your child will live."
They were all prepared for death; but now  they were
found unprepared for life. One wept that had till then
locked up all her tears within her heart; another gave a
short, palpitating shriek; and the tender-hearted  Isabel,
who had nursed the child when it was a baby, fainted away.
The youngest brother gave way to gladsome smiles; and,
calling out his dog Hector, who used to sport with him and
little sister on the moor, he told the tidings to the dumb,
irrational creature, whose eyes, it is certain, sparkled with
a sort of joy.
The clock, for some days, had been prevented from striking the hours; but the silent fingers pointed to the hour of
nine; and that, in the cottage of Gilbert Ainslie, was the
stated. hour of family worship.  His own honored minister
took the book:
He waled a portion witlh judicious care:
And Let us worship God, he said, with solenmn air.
A chapter was read-a prayer said;-and so, too, was sung
a psalm; but it was sung low, and with suppressed voices,
lest the child's saving sleep might be broken; and now and
then the female voices trembled, or some one of them  ceased altogether; for there had been tribulation and anguish,
and now hope and faith were tried in the joy of tharnksgiving.
The child still slept; and its sleep seemed more sound
and deep.  It appeared almost certain that the crisis was
over, and that the flower was not to fade.  "Children,'
said Gilbert, " our happiness is in the love we bear to one
another; and our duty is in submitting to and ser-ving God.
Gracious, indeed, has he been unto us.  Is not the recovery

thousands, would we not have filled up her grave with the
worthless dross of gold, rather than that she should have
gone down there with her sweet face and all her rosy

over the room.
"Never mind the letter, nor the debt, father," said the
eldest daughter. "We have all some little things cf our own
-a few pounds-and we shall be able to raise as much as
will keep arrest and prison at a distance.  Or if chey do
take our furnliture out of the ho-;se, all except Margaret's
bed, who cares?  We will sleep on the floor; and there are
potatoes in the field, and clear water in the spring.  We
need fear nothing, want nothing; blessed be God for all his
mercies."
Gilbert went into the sick room, and got the letter from
his wife, who was sitting at the head of the bed, watching,
with a heart blessed beyond all bliss, the calm  and regular
breathings of her child.  "T his letter,"' said he mildly, "is
not from a hard creditor.  Come with me while I read it
aloud to our children." - The letter was read aloud, and it
was well fitted to diffuse pleasure and satisfaction through
the dwelling of poverty. It was from an executor to the
will of a distant relative, who had left Gilbert Ainslie fifteen
hundred pounds. "The sum," said Gilbert, "is a large'one to folks like us, but not, I hope, large enough to turn
our heads, or make us think ourselves all lords and ladies.
It will do more, far more, than put me fairly above the
world at last. I believe, that with it, I may buy this very
farm, on which my forefathers have toiled. But God,
whose Providence has sent this temporal blessing, may he
send wisdom and prudence how to use it, and humble and
grateful hearts to us all."
" You will be able to send me to school all the year round

may hold the plough still, for you draw a straighter furrow

may sit now oftener in your arm-chair by the ingle. You
will not need to rise now in the dark, cold, and snowy winter mornings, and keep thrashing corn in the barn for hours

turn herself on her lowly bed, but with meaning in her eyes,
memory in her mind, affection in her heart, and coolness in
all her vrens, a happy group were watching the first faint
smile that broke over her features; and never did one who
stood there forget that Sabbath morning, on which she
seemed to look round upon them all with a gaze of fair and

rescued from the power of the grave.

Yet every blade of grass, and every flower,
And every bud and blossom of the spring,

Over a kindred grave. Ay-and the song
Of woodland wooer, or his nuptial lay,
As blithe as if the year no winter knew,
Is the lament of universal death.
The merry singer is the living link
Of many a thousand years of death gone by,
And many a thousand in futurity,The remlnant of a moment, spared by him
But for another meal to gorge upon.
This globe is but our fathers' cemeteryThe sun, and moon, and stars that shine on high,

IF the blessings of oar political and social condition have
not now been too highly estimlated, we cannot well over-rate
the responsibility which they impose- upon us.  We hold
these institutions of government, religion, and learning, to be
transmitted as well as enjoyed. We are in the line of con~eyance- through vwhich whatever has been obtained by the
Lsson 78.]
11,93spirit and efforts of our ancestors, is to be communicated to
our children.
We are bound to maintain* public liberty, and, by the example of our own systems, to convince the world, that order
and law, religion and morality, the rights of conscience, the
rights of persons, and the rights of property, may all be
preserved and secured, in the most perfect manner, by a
government entirely and purely elective. If we fail in this,
our dis'ster will be signal, and will furnish an argument,
stronger than has yet been found, in support of those opi.
nions, which maintain* that government can rest safely on
nothing but power and coercion. As far as experience may
show errors in our establishments, we are bound to correct
them; and if any practices exist, contrary to the principles
of justice and humanity, within the reach of our laws or our
influence, we are inexcusible if we do not exert ourselves
to restrain and abolish them.
I deem it rmy duty, on this occasion, to suggest, that the
land is not yet wholly free from the contamination of a traffic, at which every feeling of humanity  must revolt-I
mean the African slave'trade.  Neither public sentiment,
nor the law, has yet been able entirely to pfut an end to this
odious and abonminable trade. At the moment when God,
in his mercy, has blessed the world with a universal peace,
there is reason to fear, that, to the disgrace of the christian
name and character, new efforts are making for the extension of this trade, by subjects and citizens of christian states,
in whose hearts no sentiment of justice inhabits, and over
whom neither the fear of God nor the fear of man exercises
a control. In the sight of our law, the African slave trader
is a pirate and a filon; and in the sight of Heaven, an of.
fender far beyond the ordinary depth of human guilt.  There
is no brighter part of our history, than that which records'
the measulres which have been adopted by the government,
at an early day, and at different times since, for the suppression of this traffic; and I would call upon all the true
sons of New-England, to cooperate with the laws of man,
and the juLstice of Heaven.
If there be, within the extent of our knowledge or:nflu.
ence, any participation in this traffic, let us pledge ourselves here, upon the TRock of Plymouth, to extir'pate and
destroy it. It is not fit that the land of the pilgrims should
bear the shame longer.  I hear the so lnd of the hammer--
I see the smoke of the furnaces where manacles and fetters

are still f5rged for human limbs.  I see the visages of those,
who by stealth, and at midnight, labor in this work of hell,
foul and dark, as may become the arti'ficers of such instrurnents of misery and torture.   Let that spot be purified, or
let it cease to be of New-England.   Let it be purified, or
let it be set aside from the christian world; let it be pfit out
of the circle of human sympathies and human regards; and
let civilized man henceforth have no communion with it.
I would invoke those who fill the seats of justice, and all
who minister at her altar, that they execute the wholesome
anrd necessaryr severity of the law. I invoke the ministers of
our religion, that they proclaim its denunciation* of these
crimes, and add its solemn sanctions to the authority of human laws.   If the pulpit be silent, whenever, or wherever
there may be a sinner, bloody with this guilt, within the
hearing of its voice, the pulpit is false to its trust.
I call on the fair merchant, who has reaped his harvest
upon the seas, that he assist in scourging from those seas the
worst pirates that ever infested them.   That ocean which
seems to wave with a gentle magnificence, to waft the burdens of an honest commerce, and to roll its treasures with a
conscious pride; that ocean which hardy industry regards,
even when the winds have ruffled its surface, as a field of
grateful toil; what is it to the victim of this oppression when
he is broiught to its shores, and looks forth upon it for the first
time, from  beneath chains, and bleeding with stripes?-;Vhat is it to him, but a wide spread prospect of suffering,
anguish, and death?-Nor do the skies smile longer; nor is
the air frfigrant to him.  The sun is cast down from heaven.

If you would be happy when you die, be pious while you

you can attain these objects.  To those who have let that
golden opportunity slip by them; whose youth is past, and
the spirit of devotion not attained; whose manhood is arrived, and thm t temper not yet formed; whose old age is come,
and their hearts still sensual, frivolous and vain; I have no
comfort to administer, for I have no authority to comfort
you. Your best friends can only pity you and pray for you,
that God will take away your stony hearts, and give you

the question. Never, my young friends, never let that question be asked concerning you.  Surely you do not envy
their condition, concerning whom it may be justly asked.
Take heed that you do not come into their place.
To conclude: do not fear to adinit the sentiments, and to
cultivate the spirit of devotion; there is nothing tedious,
dull, or irksome in it. It is pleasant even as pleasure's self.
Though I am about to adopt the language of a poet, it is
not the language of imagination merely that I speak; what
has been said of liberty, with some degree of truth, may,
with the most perfect truth, be said of the genuine spirit of

" It makes the gloomy face of nature gay,

On tlthe reasonableness of Christian faith -BUCKIuIINSTER.
IT is a common artifice, of those who wish to depreciate
the value of this essential principle of a christian's life, to
represent faith as something opposed to reason. So far is this
from being triue, that faith is, in fact, the most reasonable
thing in the world; and, wherever religion is not concerned,
the universal'practice of mankind evinces, that suchl a principle is indispensable to the most common exercise of the
* Pront. commonly, por tenf-o like o in nor.

LLessoon 81.
understanding  and to the daily conduct of life.  Faith is
reasonable, because it is the involuntary homage which the
mind pays to the preponderance of evidence.  Faith, that is
not founded on testimony, is no longer faith.
And as it is suficient evidence only, on which a rational
faith can be supported, so if the whole of this evidence is
intelligibly presented to a sound understanding, it will not
fail to command belief.  An eye, not affected by disease,
casily distinguishes colors; and we unavoidably believe the
existence of the objects within the sphere of its vision.  Now
the laws of moral proLability are just as sure as the laws of
vision.  That the same exhibition of facts, or the same
pr6c'ess of reasoning, dces not produce equal conviction on
different minds, is not more surprising than that the same
glasses will not make objects equally distinct to eyes differently af'ected.  But, to conclude, from  this variety of
effect, that the objects presented do not exist, or that the
laws of vision are ill-founded and absurd, would be no more
unreasonable than to assume the folly of' religious faith, or
to doubt the rational conviction of a pious and impartial inquirer, merely because the whole world are not believers.
We cannot wonder, that the evidences, on which our
christian faith is built, do not produce universal conviction,
when we remember, that this is a religion, which contradicts many of the selfish propensities of the heart, and is at
war with all the lusts to which we are habitually enslaved.
It is a religion, wvnich condemns many of our habits, and
requires us to moderate our growing attachment to a world
we cannot bear to leave; a religion, which often opposes
our passions, which shows us the folly of our fondest expectations, which alarms our sleeping fears, undervalues the
objects of our estimation, requires the surrender of our
prejudices, and makes it necessary for us to be in readiness
to yield up even our comforts and oiur life.
Astonishing would it be, indeed, if a system  like this
should command universal belief, if prejudice should have
nothing to object, captiousness nothing to cavil at, and indifference no excuses.  Astonishing, indeed, would it be,
if the evidences of such a revelation should be received,
with  equal facility, by the worldly and the spiritual, the
careless and the inquisitive, the proud and the humble,
the ambitious and the unaspiring, the man immersed in
pleasure and dissipation, and the man who has been long
disciplined in the school of disappointment and affliction.Neither is religious faith unreasonable, because it includes
miraculous events, nor because it embraces a series of truths,
which no individual reason could have ascertained, or of
which it may not, even now, see the necessity.  It is on
this account, however, that we so often hear faith opposed
to reason; but, on the same principle, faith in any extrtordinary occurrence would be opposed to reason.
The only objection to the credibility of miracles is, that
they are contrary to general experience; for to say, that
they are contrary to universal experience, is to assume the
very fact in question.  Because they are supernatural, no
testimony, it is maintained, can make  it reasonable to be.
lieve them. This would_ not be just, even if the miracles
which religious faith embraces were separate, insulated
facts, which had no connexions with any other interesting
truths; much less when they make part of a gran I system,
altogether worthy the interposition of God to establish.
The extraordinary nature of miraculous facts, considered
by themselves, is, it is true, a presumption against them, but
a presumption, which sufficient testimony ought as fairly to
remove, as it does remove the previous improbability of
ordinary facts, not supernatural.  A man, born and living
within the tropics, who had never seen water congealed,
would, no doubt, think it a very strange story, if a traveller
from the north should assure him, that the same substance,
which he had always seen liquid, was, every year, in other
countries, converted into a solid mass capable of sustaining
the greatest weights.
What could more decisively contradict all the experience
of the tropical inhabitant, and even the experience of those
with whom  he had always been connected?  Yet should
we not think it very unreasonable, if he should, in this case,
persist in discrediting the testimony even of a single man,
whose veracity he had no reason to suspect, and much
more, if he should persist in opposition to the concurrent
and continually increasing testimony of numbers? Let this
be an illustration of the reasonableness of your faith in
imiracles.
As it respects the credibility of revelation, you have this
alternative.  Will you believe, that the pure system  of
christian faith, which appeared eighteen hundred years ago,
in one of the obscurest regions of the Roman empire, at the
moment of the highest mental cultivation and of the lowest
moral degeneracy, which superseded at once all the curious

FIRST CLASS BOOK.fabrics of pagan philosophy, which spread almost instanta.
neously through the civilized world in opposition to the
prejudices, the pride and the persecution of the times,
which has already had the most beneficial influence on society, and been the source of almost all the melioration of
the human character, and which is now the chief support of
the harmony, the domestic happiness, the morals and the
intellectual improvement of the best part of the world-will
you believe, I say, that this system  originated in the unaided reflections of twelve Jewish fishermen on the sea of
Galilee, with the son of a carpenter at their head?  Or will
you admit a supposition, which solves all the wonders of
this case, which accounts at once for the perfection of the
system, and the miracle of its propagation,--that Jesus was,
as he professed to be, the prophet of God, and that his
apostles were, as they declared, empowered to perform  the
miracles, which subdued the incredulity of the world.
I appeal to you, ye departed masters of pagan wisdom,
Plato, Socrates, Cicero, which of these alternatives is the
most rational, the most worthy of a philosophical assent?
Your systems have passed away, like the light clouds, which
chase one another over the hemisphere; but the gospel of
Jesus Christ, the sun of righteousness, pursues its equal and
luminous career, uninterrupted and unobscured. Surely, if
a miracle of the New  Testament is incredible, what will
you say of the enormous faith of a man, who believes in
that monster of improbability, which we have described,
the simply human origin and progress of christianity.

-  Oniie importance of Christian faith.-BUCKMINSTER.
THE value of christian faith may be estimated from  the
consolations it affords.
Who w;ould look back upon the history of the world with
the eye of incredulity, after having once read it with the
eye of faith? To the man of faith it is the story of God's
operations. To the unbeliever it is only the record of the
strange sports of a race of agents, as uncontrolled, as they
are unaccountable. To the man of faith every portion of
history is part of a vast plan,, conceived, ages ago, in the
imind of Omnipotence, which has been fitted plecisely to the
THE AMERICAN
[Lessong 82.period it was intended to occupy.  The whole series of
events forms a magnificent and symmetrical fabric to the
eye of pious contemplation; and though the dome be in the
clouds, and the top, from  its loftiness, be indiscernible to
mortal vision, yet the foundations are so deep and solid,
that we are sure they are intended to support something
permanent and grand.
To the skeptic all the events of all the ages of the world
are but a scattered crowd of useless and indrrested materials.
In his mind all is darkness, all is incomprehensible. The
light of prophecy illuminates not to him  the obscurity of
ancient annals.  He sees in. them neither design nor operation, neither tendencies nor conclusions.  To him the wonderful knowledge of one people is just as interesting, as the
desperate ignorance of another.  In the deliverance, which
God has sometimes wrought for the oppressed, he sees
nothing but the fact; and in the oppression and decline of
haughty empires, nothincg but the common accidents of
national fortune.  Going about to account for events, according to what he calls general laws, he never for a moment considers, that all laws, whether physical, political,
or mroral, imply a legislator, and are contrived to serve
some purpose. Because he cannot always, by his shortsighted vision, discover the tendencies of the mighty events,
of which this earth has been the theatre, he looks on the
drama of existence arounl! him as proceeding without a plan.
Is that principle, then, of no importance, which raises man
above what his eyes see, or his ears hear, or his touch feels,
at present, and shows him  the vast chain of human events,
fastened eternally to the throne of God, and returning,
after embracing the universe, again to link itself to the footstool of Omnipotence?
Would youi know the value of this principle of faith to the
b)ereaved?  Go, and follow a corpse to the grave.  See the
body deposited there, and hear the earth thrown in upon all
that remains of your friend.  Return now, if you will, and
brood over the lesson, which your senses have given you,
and derive from  it what consolation you can.  You have
learned nothing but an unconsoling fact.  No voice of comfort issues from the tomb. All is still tnere, and blank and
lifeless, and has been so for ages.

not an affliction is lost, not a changcre is unimproved.  He
studies even his own history with pleasure, and finds it full
of instruction.  The darlk passages of his life are illuminated
with hope; and he sees, that, although he has passed through
many dreary defiles, yet they have opened at last into
brighter regions of existence.  He recalls, with a species of
wondering gratitude, periods of his life, when all its events
seemed to conspire against him.  Hemmed in by straitened
circumstances, wearied with repeated blows of unexpected
misfortune, and exhausted with the painful anticipatio, of
more, he recollects years, when the ordinary love of life
could not have retained him in the world. Ma-ny a time he
might have wished to lay down his being in disgust, had not
something, more than the senses provide us with, kept up
the elasticity of his mind.  He yet lives, and has found that
light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright
in heart.
The man of faith discovers some gracious purpose in
every combination of circumstances.  Wherever he finds
himself, he knows that he has a destination-he has, therefore, a duty.  Everv event has, in his eye, a tendency and an
aim.  Nothing is accidental, nothing without a purpose, nothing unattended with benevolent consequences. Every thing on
earth is probationary, nothing ultimate. He is poor-perhap..
his plans have been defeated-he finds it difficult to provide
for the exigencies of life-sickness is permitted to invade
the quiet of his household-long confinement imprisons his
activity, and cuts short the exertions, on which so manv depend-something apparently unlucky mars his best plarsnew failures and embarrassments among his friends present

nature of his fortitude.  There are those, whose sympathetic piety can read and interpret the characters of resignation on his brow.  There are those, in fine, who have felt
the influence of faith.
In this influence there is nothing mysterious, nothing romantic, nothing of which the highest reason may be ashanied.  It shows the christian his God, in all the mild maiesly
of his parental character.  It shows you God, disposing in
still and benevolent wisdom the events of every individual's
life, pressing the pious spirit with the weight of calamity to
increase the elasticity of the mind, producing characters of
unexpected worth by unexpected misfortune, invigorating
certain virtues by peculiar probations, thus breaking the fetters which binds us to temporal things, and

like apprehension?   The world, it is trrue, begins to shut
in.  The shadows of evening collect around his senses.  A
dark mist thickens and rests upon the objects, which have
hitherto engaged his observation.  The countenances of his
friends become more and more indistinct.  The sweet expressions of love and friendship are no longer intelligible.
tHis ear wakes no more at the well-known voice of his children, and the soothing accents of tender affection die away,
unheard, upon his decaying senses.  To him the spectacle
of human life is drawing to its close, and the curtain is descending, which shuts out this earth, its actors, and its scenes.
He is no longer interested in all that is done under the sun.

NVight.-DENNIE's LAY PREACHER.
"Watchman, what of the night?"
Isaiah xxi. Il.
To this query of Isaiah, the watchman replies, " That
the nlorning cometh, and also the night."  The brevity
196
[Lesson 86.of this answer has left it involved in something of the
obscurity of the season when it was given.  I think that
night, however sooty and ill-favored it may be pronounced
by those who were born under a day-star, merits a more
particular description. I feel peculiarly disposed to arrange
some ideas in favor of this season. I know that the majority are literally blind to its merits; they must be prominent indeed to be discerned by the closed eyes of the snorer,
who thinks that night was made for nothing but sleep.  But
the student and the sage are willing to believe that it was
formed for higher purposes; and that it not only recruits
exhausted spirits, but sometimes informs inquisitive, and
armends wicked ones.
Duty, as well as inclination, urges the Lay Preacher to
sermonize, while others slumber.  To read numerous volumes in the morning, and to observe various characters at
noon, will leave but little time, except the night, to digest
the one or speculate upon the other. The night, therefore,
is often dedicated to composition, and while the light of the
paly planets discovers at his desk the Preacher, more wan
than they, he may be heard repeating emphatically with
Dr. Young,
"Darkness has much Divinity for me."
He is then alone, he is then at peace.  No companions near,
but the silent volumes on his shelf, no noise abroad, but the
click of the village clock, or the bark of the village dog.
The deacon has then smoked his sixth, and last pipe, and
asks not a question more, concerning Josephus, or the
church. Stillness aids study, and the sermon proceeds.
Such being the obligations to night, it would be ungrateful not to acknowledge them. As my watchful eyes can
discern its dim beauties, my warm heart shall feel, and my
prompt pen shall describe, the uses and the pleasures of
the nocturnal hour.
Watchman, what of the night?  I can with propriety
imagine this question addressed to myself: I am a professed
l.ucubrator, and who so well qualified to delineate the sable
hours, as
" A meagre, muse-rid mope, adust and thin?"
However injuriously night is treated by the sleepy moderns,
~the vigilance of the ancients could not overlook its benefits
and joys.  In as early a record as the book of Genesis, I
find that Isaac, though he devoted his assiduous days to

197action, reseried speculation till night.  "He went out to
meditate in the field at the eventide."  He chose that sad,
that solemn hour, to reflect upon the virtues of a beloved,
and departed mother.  The tumult and glare of day suited
not with the sorrow of his soul. lie had lost his most
amiable, most genuine friend, and his unostentatious grief
was eager for privacy and shade. Sincere sorrow rarely
suffers its tears to be seen. It was natural for Isaac to se.
lect a season to weep in, which should resemble " the colcr
of his fate."  The darkness, the solemnity, the stillness
of the eve, were favorable to his melancholy purpose. He
forsook, therefore, the bustling tents of his father, the
pleasant "south country," and " well of Lahairoi," he went
out and pensively meditated at the eventide.
The Grecian and Roman philosophers firmly believed
that " the dead of midnight is the noon of thought." One
of them is beautifully described by the poet, as soliciting
knowledge from the skies, in private and nightly audience,
and that neither his theme, nor his nightly walks were forsaken till the sun appeared and dimmed his "nobler intellectual beam." We undoubtedly owe to the studious nights
of the ancients most of their elaborate anid immortal pro.
ductions. Among them it was necessary that every man of
letters should trim the midnight lamp.  The day might be
given to the forum or the circus, but the night was the season for the statesman to project his schemes, and for the
poet to pour his verse.
Night has likewise with great reason been considered m
every age as the astronomer's day. Young observes, with
energy, that " an undevouzt astronomer is mad."  The privilege of contemplating those brilliant and numerous myriads
of planets which bedeck our skies is peculiar to night, and
it is our duty, both as lovers of moral and natural beauty, to
bless that season, when we are indulged with such a gorgeous
display of glittering and iuseful light.  It must be confessed
that the seclusion, calmness, and tanquillity of midnight, is
most friendly to serious, and even airy contemplations.
I think it treason to this sable power, who holds divided
empire with day, constantly to shut our eyes at her approach.
To long sleep, I am decidedly a foe. As it is expressed by
a quaint writer, we shall all have enough of that in the
grave. Those, who cannot break the silence of night by
vocal throat, or eloquent tongue, may be permitted to disturb it by a snoire.  But he, among my readers, who possesses

LESSON LXXXVII.
Midnight Musings.-W-T. IRVING.
I AMI now alone in my chamber. The family have long
since retired. I have heard their steps die away, and the
doors clap to after them. The murmur of voices and the
peal of remote laughter no longer reach the ear.  The
clock from the church, in which so many of the former
inhabitants of this house lie buried, has chimed the awful
hour of midnight.
I have sat by the window and mused upon the dusky
landscape, watching the lights disappearing one by one
fromr the distant village; and the moon rising in her silent
majesty, and leading up all the silver pomp of heaven. As
I have gazed upon these quiet groves and shadowing lawns,
silvered over and imperfectly lighted by streaks of dewy
moonshine, my mind has been crowded by "thick coming
fancies" concerning those spiritual beings which
".--. Walk the earth
Unseen both when we wake and when we sleep."
Are there, indeed, such beings?  Is this space between us
and the Deity filled up by innumerable orders of spiritual
beings, forming the same gradations between the human
soul and divine perfection, that we see prevailing from
humanity down to the meanest insect? It is a sublime and
beautiful doctrine inculcated by the early fathers, that there
are guardian angels appointed to watch over cities and nations, to take care of good men, and to guard and guide the
steps of helpless infancy.  Even the doctrine of departed
spirits returning to visit the scenes and beings, which were
dear to them during the bodies' existence, thouglh it has
been debased by the absurd superstitions of the vulgar, in
itself is awfully solemn and sublime.
Lesson 87.]
199Itowe'er lightly it nmay be ridiculed, yet, the attention
involuntarily yielded to it whenever it is made the subject
of serious discussion, and its prev'alence in all ages and
countries, even among newly discovered nations that have
had no previous interchange of thought with other parts of
the world, prove it to be one of those mysterious and instinctive beliefs, to which, if left to ourselves, we should naturally
incl ine.
In spite of all the pride of reason and philosophy, a vague
doubt will still lurk in the mind, and perhaps will never be
eradicated, as it is a matter that does not admit of positive
demonstration.  Who yet has been able to comprehend and
describe the nature of the soul; its mysterious connexion
with the body; or in what part of the frame it is situated?
We know rnerelyr that it does exist: but whence it came,
and when it entered into us, and how it is retained, and
where it is seated, and how it operates, are all matters of
mere speculation, and contradictory theories. If, then, we
are thus ignorant of this spirituval essence, even while it
forms a part of ourselves, and is continually present to our
consciousness, how can we pretend to ascertain or deny its
powers and operations, when released from its fleshly prisonhouse?
Every thing connected with our spiritual nature is full of
doubt and difieculty.  "We are fearfully and wonderfully
made:" we are surrounded by mysteries, and we are mysteries even to ourselves. It is more the manner in which
this superstition has been degraded, than its intrinsic absurdity, that has brought it into contempt. Raise it above
the frivolous purposes to which it has been applied, strip it
of the gloom and horror with which it has been enveloped,
and there is none, in the whcle circle of visionary creeds,
that could more delightfully elevate the imagination, or
more tenderly affect the heart. It would become a sovereign
comfort at the bed of death, soothing the bitter tear wrung
from us by the agony of mortal separation.
WVhat could be more consoling than the idea, tha-t the
souls of those we once loved were permitted to return and
watch  over our welfare?--that affectionate and gua]dian
spirits sat by our pillows when we slept, keeping a vigil
over our most helpless hours?-that beauty and innocence,
which had languished into the tomb, yet smiled unseen
around  us, revealing  themselves in  those blest dreams
wherein we live over again the hours of past endearments 2

[Lesson 87.A belief of this kind would, I should think, be a new incentive t, virtue, rendering us cir'cumspect, even in our
nimost secret moments, from  the idea that those we once
loved and honored were invisible witnesses of all our actions.
It would take away, too, from that loneliness and destitution, which we are apt to feel more and more as we get on
in our pilgrimage through the wilderness of this world, and
find that those who set forward with us lovingly and cheerily, on the journey, have one by one dropped away from
our side.  Place the superstition in this light, and I coniess
I should like to be a believer in it.-I see nothing in it
that is incomlpatible witli the tender arnd merciful nature of
our religion, or revolting to the wishes and affections of
the heart.
There are departed beings that I have loved as I never
again shall love in this world; that have loved me as I
never again shall be loved.  If such beings do even retain
in their blessed spheres the attachments which they felt on
earth; if they take an interest in the poor concerns of
transient mortality, and are permitted to hold communion
with those whom they have loved on earth, I feel as if
now, at this deep hour of night, in this silence and solitude,
I could receive their visitation with the most solemn but
unalloyed delight.
In truth, such visitations would be too happy for this
world: they would take away fromp the bounds and barriers
that hem us in and keep us from each other.  Our existence
is doomed to be made up of transient embraces and long
separations. The most intimate friendshiD--of what brief
and scattered portions of time does it consist! We take
each other by the hand; and we exchange a few words
and looks of kindness; and we rejoice together for a few
short moments; and then days, months, years intervene,
and we have no intercourse with each other.  Or if we
dwell together for a season, the grave soon closes its gates,
and cuts off all further communion; and our spirits must
remain in separation and widowhood, until they meet again
in that more perfect state of being, where soul shall dwell
with soul, and there shall be no such thing as death, or ab-.
sencc, or any other interruption of our union.

Spr in g-.-DL NNIE.'Triuly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun."--Ecclesiastes, xi. 7.
THE sensitive Gray, in a frank letter to his friend West,
assures himn that, when the sun grows warm enough to tenlpt
him  froml the fire-side, he will, like all other things, be the
better for his influence; for the sun is an old friend, and an
excellent nurse.  This is an opinion, which will be easily
entertained by every one, who has been cramped by the icy
hand of Winter, and who feels the gay and renovating influence of Spring.  In those mournful months, when vegetables and animals are alike coerced by cold, man is tributary to the howling storm and the sullen sky; and is, in the
pathetic phrase of Johnson, a " slave to gloom." But when
the earth is disencumbered of her load of snows, and warmth
is felt, and twitteringr swallows are heard, he is again j6c'und
and free.  Nature renews her charter to her sons, and rejoicing mortals, in the striking language of the poet, " revisit
light, and feel its sovereign, vital lamp." Hence is enjoyed,
in the highest luxury,
"Day, and the sweet approach of even, and morn,
e   And sight of vernal bloom, and summer's rose,
And flocks, and herds, and human face divine."
It is nearly impossible for me to convey to my readers an
idea of the " vernal delight," felt, at this period, by the Lay
Preacher, far declined in the vale of vears. My spectral
figure, pinched by the rude gripe of January, becomes as
thin as that "dagger of lath," employed by the vaunting
Falstaff; and my mind, affected by the universal desolation
of Winter, is nearly as vacant of joy and bright ideas, as
the forest is of leaves, and the grove is of song.
Fortunately for my  happiness, this is only  periodical
spleen. Though, in the bitter months, surveying my extenuated body, I exclaim, with the melancholy prophet, "IMy
leanness, my leanness, wo unto me!" and though, advertlng
to the state of my mind, I behold it, " all in a robe of darkest grain;" yet, when April and May reign in sweet vicissitude, I give, like Horace, care to the winds; and perceive
the whole system excited, by the potent stimulus of sunshine.

"Young and old come forth to play,
On a sunshine holiday."
In merry Spring-time, not only birds, but mel'ancholic,
old fellows, like myself, sing.  The sun is the poet's, the
invalid's, and the hypochon'driac's friend.  Under clement
skies, and genial sunshinle, not only the body is corroborated, but the mind is vivified, and the heart becomes " open as
day."  I may be considered fanciful in the assertion, but I
am  positive that many, who, in November, December, January, February, and March, read nothing but Mandeville,
Rochefoucauit,* and Hobbes, and cherish malignant thoughts,
at the expense of poor human nature, abjure their evil books
and sour theories, when a softer season succeeds.  I have,
myself, in Wibnter, felt hostile to those, whom I could smile
upon in May, and clasp to my bosom  in June.  Our moral
qualities, as well as natural objects, are affected by physical
laws; and I canl easily conceive that benevolence, no less
than the sun flower, flourishes and expands under the luminary of day.
With unaffected earnestness, I hope that none of my
readers will look upon the agreeable visitation of the sun,
at this beauteous season, as the impertinent call of a crabbed'monitor, or an impor'tunate dun.  I hope that none will
churlishly tell him " how they hate his beams." I am credibly informed that several of my city friends, many fine
ladies, and the worshipful society of loungers, consider the
early call of the above red-faced personage, as downright
intrusion.  It must be confessed that he is fond of prying
into chambers and closets, but, not like a rude searcher, or
libertine gallant', for injurious or licentious purposes.  Ilis
designs are beneficent, an.d he is one of the warmest friends
in the woild.
Notwithstanding, his looks are sometimes a little suspicious, and he presents himself with thg fiery eye and flushed
cheek of a jolly toper, yet this is only a new proof of the
fa.'lacy of physiognomy,t for he is the most regular being in

Extract from'A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of
Ossian.'-BLAIR.
BESIDES human personages, divine or supernatural agents
are often introduced into epic poetry; form-ingr  what is
called the machinery of it; which most critics hold to be
an essential part. The marvellous, it must be admitted,
has always a great charm  for the bulk of readers.  It gratifies the imagination, and affords room for striking and sublime  description.  No  wonder, therefore, that all poets
should have a strong propensity towards it.
But I must observe, that nothingr is more difficult, than
to adjust properly the marvellous with the probable. If a
poet sacrifice* probability, and fill his work with extravagant
supernatural scenes, he spreads over it an appearance of
romance' and childish fiction; he transports his readers from
this world, into a fantastic, visionary region; and loses
that weight and dignity which should reign in epic poetry.
No work, from  which probability is altogether banished,
can make a lasting or deep impression.  Human actions.
and manners, are always the most interesting objects which
can be presented to a human mind.
All machinery, the]refore, is faulty which withdraws these
too much from  view; or obscures them  under a cloud of
incredible fictions.   Besides being temperately employed,
machinery ought always to have some foundation in poptlar
belief.  A poet is by no means at liberty to invent what
system of the marvellous he pleases:   He must avail himself eithler of the religious faith, or the superstitious credulity,
of the country wherein he lives; so as to give an air of
probability to events which are most contrary to the common
coiurse of nature.
In these respects, Ossian appears to me to have been
remarkably happy.  He has indeed  followed the  samne

invented by him, in consequence of profound reflections on
the benefit it would yield to poetry.  Homer was no such
refining genius. He found the traditionary stories on which
lie built his Iliad, mingled with popular legends, concerning
the intervention of the gods; and he adopted these, because
they amused the fancy.
Ossian, in like manner, found the tales of his country full
of ghosts and spirits: It is likely he believed them himself;
and he introduced them, because they gave his poems that
solemn and marvellous cast, which suited his genius.  This
was the only machinery he could employ with propriety;
because it was the only intervention of supernatural beings,
which agreed with the common belief of the country. It
was happy; because it did not inter-fere, in the least, with
the proper display of human characters and actions; because
it had less of the incredible, than most other kinds of poetical machinery; and because it served to diversify the scene,
and to heighten the subject by an awful grandeur, which is
thle great design of mnachirery.
As Ossian's mythology is peculiar to himself, and makes a
considerable figure in his other poems, as well as in Fingal,
it may be proper to mrnake somie observations on it, independent of its subserviency to epic composition. It turns for the
most part on the appearances of departed spirits.
These, consonantly to the notions of every rude age, are
represented not as purely imr.aterial, but as thin airy forms,
which can be visible or invisible at pleasure; their voice
is feeble; their arm  is weak; but they are endowed with
knowledge more than human.  In a separate s{(t',:  they
retain the same dispositions which animated them  in this
life.  They ride on the wind; they bend. their airy bows;
and pursue deer formed of clouds.  The ghosts of departed
bards continue to sing.  The ghosts of departed heroes
frequent' the fields of their former fame.  "Thev rest together in their caves, and talk of mortal men.  Their songs
are of other worlds. They come sometimes to the ear of
rest, and raise their feeble voice."
All this presents to us much the same set of ideas, conzerning spirits, as we find in the eleventh booix uf the
Od'yssey, where Ulysses visits the regions of the dead:
And in the twenty-third book of the Iliad, the ghost of Patroclus, after appearing to Achilles, vanishes precisely like

As you have been used to look to me in all your actions,
and have been afraid to do any thing, unless you first knew
my wili; so let it now be a rule of your life to look up to
God in all your actions, to do every thinc in his fear, and to
abstain from every thing which is not according to his will.
Next to this, love all mankind with such tenderness and affection, as you love yourself. Think how God loves all mankind how merciful he is to them, how tender he is of them,
how carefully he preserves them, and then strive to love the
world as' God loves it.
Do good, my son, first of all to those who most deserve it,
but remember to do good to all. The greatest sinners
receive daily instances of God's goodness towards them; he
nourishes and preserves them, that they may repent and
return: to him; do you therefore imitate God, and think no
one too bad to receive your relief and kindness, when you
see that he wants it.
Let your dress be sober, clean, and modest; not to set off
the beauty of your person, but to declare the sobriety of
your mind; that your outward garb may resemble the inward plainness and simplicity of your hleart.  For it is highly reasonable that you should be one man, and appear outwardly such as you are inwardly.
In meat and drink, observe the rules of christian tempe
rance and sobriety; consider your body only as the servant
and minister of your soul; and only so nourish it, as it may
best perform an humble and obedient service.
Love humility in all its instances; practise it in all its
parts; for it is the noblest state of the soul of man: it will
set your heart and affections right towards God, and fill you
with whatever temper is tender an:d affectionate towards
men.
Let every day therefore be a day of humility: condescend to all the weakness and infirmities of your fellowcreatures; cover their frailties; love their excellences; encourage their virtues; relieve their wants; rejoice in their
prosperity; compassionate their distress; receive their
friendship; overlook their unkindness; forgive their malice; be a servant of servants; and condescend to do the
lowest offices for the lowest of mankind.

one of Ossian's, emitting a shrill, feeble cry, and melting
away like smole.
But though  Homer's  and  Ossian's  ideas concerning
ghosts were of the same nature, we cannot but observe that
Ossian's ghosts are drawn with much stronger and livelier
colors than those of Homer.  Ossian describes ghosts with
all the particularity of one who had seen and conversed
with them, and whose ima(gination was full of the impression they had left upon it.  Crugal's ghost, in particular, in
the beginninlg of the second book of Fingal, may vie with
any appearance of this kind, described by any epic or tragic
poet whatever..Most poets would have contented themselves with telling
us, that he resembled, in every particular, the living Crugal; that his form  and dress were the same, only his face
more pale and sad; and that he bore the marlc of the
v.ound by which he fell. But Ossian sets before our eyes
a spirit from the invisible world, distinguished by all those
features, which a strong astonished imagination would give
to a ghost.  "A dark red stream  of fire comes down from
the hill.  Crugal sat upon the beam; he that lately fell by
the hand of Swaran, striving in the battle of heroes. His
face is like the beam of the setting moon.  His robes are
of the clouds of the hill.  His eves are like two decaying
flames.  Dark is the wounl of his breast.  The stars dimtwinkled through his form; and his voice was like the sound
of a distant stream."
The circumstance of the stars being beheld, " dim-twinkling through his form,"  is wonderfiully picturesque; and
conveys the most lively impression of' his thin and shadowy
substance.  The attitude in which he is afterwards placed,
and the speech put into his mouth, are full of that solemn
and awful sublimity, which suits the subject.  " Dim, and in
tears, he stood and stretched his pale hand over the hero.
Faintly he raised his feeble voice, like the gale of the
reedy Lego.  Mly ghost, O Connal' is onl my native hills,
but my corse is on the sands of Ullin.  Thou shalt nev:;r
talk with Crugal, or find his lonle steps in the heath.  I am
light as the blast of Cromla; and I move like the shadow
of mist.  Connal, son of Colgar! I see the dark cloud of
death.  It hovers over the plains of Lenna.  The sons of
green Erin shall fall.  Remove from  the field of ghosts.
Lilke the darkened moon he retired in the midst of the
whistling blast."Several other appearances of spirits might be pointed
out as among the most sublime passages of Ossian's poetry.
The circumstances of them are considerably diversified;
and the scenery always suited to the occasion. " Oscar
slowly ascends the hill. The meteors of night set on the
heath before him. A  distant torrent faintly roars. Unfrerluent blasts rush throiugh aged oaks. The half-enlightened
moon sinks dim and red behind her hill. Feeble voices are
heard on the heath.  Oscar drew his sword."
Nothing can prepare the fancy more happily for the
awfiul scene that is to follow.  "Trenmor calne from his
hill, at the voices of his mighty son. A cloud, like the steed
of the stranger, supported his airy limbs. His robe is of the
mist of Lano, that brings death to the people. His sword
is a green meteor, half-extinguished.  His face is without
form, and dark. He sighed thrice over the hero:  And
thrice, the winds of the night roared around. Many were
his words to Oscar. He slow-ly vanished, like a mist that
melts on the suny hill."'T'o appearances of this kind, we can find no parallel
among the Greek or Roman poets. They bring to mind
that noble description in the book of Job: "In thoughts
from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on
men, fear came upon ine, and trembling, which made all
my bones to shake. Then a spirit passed before my face;
the hair of my flesh stood up: It stood still, but I could not
discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes:
--There waxs silence, and I heard a voice-Shall mortal man
be more just than Go J?"#

7'le Baptism.--VILso N.
IT is a pleasant and impressive time, when at the close of
Il vine service, in some small country church, there take
place the gentle stir and preparation for a baptism.  A sudden air of cheerfulness spreads over the whole congrregation; the more solemn expression of all countenances fades
away; and it is at once felt, that a rite is about to be performed, which, although of a sacred and awful kind, is yet
connected with a thousand delightful associations of purity,
beauty, and innocence.  Then there is an eager bending of
smiling faces over the humble galleries-an unconscious
rising up in affectionate curiosity-and a slight murmuring
sound. in which is no violation of the Sabbath sanctity of
God's house, when in the middle passage of the chuirch the
party of women is seen, matrons and maids, who bear in
their bosoms, or in their arms,-the helpless beings about to
be made members of the Christian communion.
* Sentines were placed on the surrounding hills, to give warning of the ap.
preach of the military.
Lesson 93.]
211There sit, all dressed becomingly in white, the fond and
happy baptismal. group.  The babes have been intrusted,
for a precious hour, to the bosoms of young maidens, who
tenderly fold them to their yearning hearts, and with endearments taught by nature, are stilling, not always successfully, their plaintive cries. Then the proud and delighted
girls rise up, one after the other, in sight of the whole congregation, and hold up the infants, arrayed in neat caps and
long flowing linen, into their father's hands. For the poorest
of the poor, if he has a heart at all, will have his infant
well dressed on such a day, even although it should scant
his meal for weeks to come, and force him  to spare fuel to
his winter fire.
And now the fathers are all standing below the pulpit,
with grave and thoughtful faces.  Each has tenderly taken
his infant into his toil-hardened hands, and supports it in
gentle and steadfast affection. They are all the children of
poverty, and, if they live, are destined to a life of toil. But
now poverty puts on its most pleasant aspect, for it is beheld standing before the altar of religion with contentnlent
and faith.
This is a time, when the better and deeper nature of
every man must rise up -within him; and when: he must
feel, more especially, that he is a spiritual and an immortal
being making covenant with God.  He is atout to take upon
himself a holy charge; to promise to look after his child's
immortal soul; and to keep its little feet from  the paths of
evil, and in those of innocence and peace.  Such a thought
elevates the lowest mind above itself-diffuses additionial
tenderness over the domestic relations, and makes them
who hold up their infants to the baptismal font, better fathers,
husbands, and sons, by the deeper insight which they then
possess into their nature.and their life.
The minister consecrates the water-and as it falls on
his infant's face, the father feels the great oath in his soul.
As the poor helpless creature is wailing in his armrs, he
thinks how needful indeed to human infancy is the love of
Providence!  And when, after delivering each his child
into the arms of the smiling maiden from  whom  he had
received it, he again takes his place for admonition and
advice before the pulpit, his mind is well disposed to think
on the perfect beauty of that religion of which the Divine
Fou.nder said, " Suffer little children to be brought unto me,
for of such is the kingdom of heaven!"
212
[Lesson 93.
THIE AMIERICANThe rite of baptism had not thus been performed for
ieveral months in the kirk* of Lanark.  It was now the hottest time of persecution; and the inhabitants of that parish
found other places in which to worship God and celebrate
the ordinances of religion. It was the Sabbath-day,-and
a small congregation, of about a hundred souls, had met
for divine service in a place of worship more magnificent
than any temple that human hands had ever built to Deity
Hlere, too, were three children about to be baptized.  The
congregation had not assembled to the toll of the bell,-but
each heart knew the hour and observed it; for there are a
hundred sun-dials among the hills, woods, moors, and fields,
and the shepherd and the peasants see the hours passing by
them in sunshine and shadow.
The church in which they were assembled, was hewn,
by God's hand, out of the eternal rocks. A river rolled its
way through a mighty chasm of cliffs, several hundred feet
-high, of which the one side presented enormous masses, and
the other corresponding recesses, as if the great stone girdle had been rent by a conv-ulsion.  The channel was overspread with prodigious fragments of rock or large loose
stones, some of them smooth and bare, others containing
soil and -verdure in their rents and fissures, and here and
there crowned with shrubs and trees.  The eye could at
once command a long stretching vista, seemingly closed and
shut up at both extremities by the co/ilescin-g cliffs.
This majestic reach of rivers contained pools, streams,
rushing shelves, and waterfalls innumerable; and when the
water was low, wrhich it now was in the common drought,it was easy to walk up this scene with the calm blue slcky
overhead, an utter and sublime solitude.  On looking up,
the soul was bowed down by the feeling of that prodigrious
height of unsealeaable and often overhangnging cliff.  Between
the channel and the summit of the far-extended precipices,
were perpetually flying rooks and wood-pigeons, and now
and then a hawk, filling the profound abyss with their wild
cawing, deep murmur, or shrilly shriek.
Sometimes a heron would stand erect and still on some.

out those galleries from the solid rock, and laid at their feet
the calmn water in its transparent beauty, in which they
could see themselves sitting in reflected groups, with their
Bible s in their hands.
Here, upon a semi-circular ledge of rocks, over a narrow
chasm  of which the tiny stream  played in a murmuring
waterfall, and divided the congregation into two equal parts,
sat; about a hundred persons, all devoutly listening to their
minister, who stood before them  on what might well be
called a small natural pulpit of living stone.  Up to it there
led a short flight of steps, and over it waved the canopy of
a tall graceful birch tree.  This pulpit stood on the middle
of the channel, directly facing that congregation, and separated from  them  by the clear, deep, sparkling pool into
which the scarce-heard water poured over the blackened
rock.
The water, as it left the pool, separated into two streams,
and flowed on each side of that altar, thus placing it in an
island, whose -large mossy stones were richly embowered
under the golden blossoms and green tresses of the broom.
Divine service was closed, and a row of maidens, all clothed
in purest white, came gliding off from  the congregation,
and crossing the stream on some stepping stones, arranged
themselves at the foot of the pulpit, with the infants about
to be baptized.  TThe fathers of the infants, just as if they
had been in their own kirk, had been sitting there during
worship, and now stood up before the minister.
The baptismal water, taken from that pellucid pool, was
lying consecrated in a small hollow of one of the upright
stones that formed one side or pillar of the pulpit, and the
holy rite proceeded.   Some of the younger ones in that
semi-circle kept gazing down into the pool, in which the
whole scene was reflected, and now and then, in spite of
the grave looks, or admonishing whispers of their elders,
letting a pebble fall into the water, that they might judge
of its depth from the length of time that elapsed before the
clear air-bells lay sparkling on the agitated surface.
The rite was over, and the religious service of the day
closed by a psalm.  The mighty rocks heninmed in the holy
sound, and sent it, in a more compacted volume, clear,
sweet, and strong, up to heaven.  When the psalm ceased,
an echo, like a spirit's voice, was heard dying away high
up among the magnificent architecture of the cliffs, and
214
[Lesson 9,8once more might be noticed in the silence the reviving voice
of the waterfall.
Just then a large stone fell firom  the top of the cliff into
the pool, a loud voice was heard, and a plaid* hung over on
the point of a shepherd's staff   Their watchful sentinel
had descried danger, and this xvas his warning.  Forthwith
the congregation rose.  r'iere were paths dangerous to unpr:ctised feet, along the ledges of the rocks, leading up to
several caves and places of concealment.  The more active
and young assisted the elder--more especially the old pastor,
and the women with the infants; and many minutes
had not elapsed, till not a living creature was visible in the
channel of the stream, but all of them hidden, or nearly so,
in the clefts and caverns.
The shepherd who had given the alarm  had lain down
again in his plaid instantly on the green swardt upon the
summit of these precipices.  A party of soldiers were immediately upon him, and demanded what signals he had
been making, and to whom; when one of them, looking'
over the edge of the cliff, exclaimed, " See, see! Hulmphrey, we have caught the whole tabernacle of the Lord in
a net at last.  There they are, praising God among the
stones of the river MIlouss.  These are the Cartland Craigs.
By my soul's salvation, a noble cathedral!"  "Fling  the
lying sentinel over the cliffs.  Here is a canting covenanter
for you, deceiving honest soldiers on the very Sabbath-day.
Over with him, over with him-out of the gallery into the
pit."
But the shepherd had vanished like a shadow; and mixing with the tall green broom and bushes, was nlaking his
unseen way towards a wood. ".Satan has saved his servant;
but come, my lads-follow me-I knowv the way down into
the bed of the stream-and the steps up to Wallace's Cave.

The soldiers dashed down a less precipitous part of the
wooded banks, a little below tle " crIaigs," and hurried iup
the channel.  But nwhen they reached the altar where the
old gray-haired minister lhad been seen standingc, and the
rocks that had been covered with people, all was silent and

Anecdotes of lMozart.--ScRAP BooK.
THE most celebrated of Mozart's Ital;an  operas is Don
Juan, of which the overture was composed under very remarlcable  circumstances.  Mozart'was much  addicted to
trifling amusement, and was accustomed to indulge himself
in that too common attendant upon superior talent, procrastination. The general rehearsal of this opera had taken
place, and the evening before the first performance had arrived, but not a note of the overture was written.
At about eleven at night, Mozart came home, and desired
his wife to make him  some punch, and to stay with him to
keep him awake. Accordingly, when he began to write, she
began to tell him fairy tales and odd stories, which made
him laugh, and by the very exertion preserved him  from
sleep. The punch, however, made him  so drowsy, that he
could only write while his, wife was talking, and dropped
asleep as soon as she ceased.
He was at last so fatigued by these unnatural efforts, that
he persuaded his wife to suffer him  to sleep for an hour.
He slept, however, for two hours, and at five o'clock  n the
morning, she awakened him.  He nad appointed hi, music
copiers to come at seven, and when they arrived, the overture was finished. It was played without a rehearsal, and
was justly applauded as a brilliant and grand composition.
re ought at the same time to say, that some very sagacious
critics have discovered the passages in the composition
where Mozart dropt asleep, and those where he was suddenly awakened.'Firn bodily frame of Mozart was tender and exquisitely
ernslble; Xil health soon overtook him, and brought with it
a melancholy, approaching to despondency.  A very short

THE AMER1CAN
[Lesson 95.time before his death, which took place when he was only
thirty-six, he composed that celebrated requiem, which, by
an extraordinary presentiment of his approaching dissolution, he:onsidered as written for his own funeral.
On(e day, when he was plunged in a profound reverie, he
heard a carriage stop at his door.  A stranger was announced,
who requested to speak with him. A  person was introduced, handsomely dressed, of dignified and  impressive
manners.  "I have been commissioned, Sir, by a man of
considerable importance, to call upon you."-," Who is he?"
interrupted Mozart.  "He does not wish to be known.""Well, what does he want?"  "He has just lost a person
whom he tenderly loved, and whose memory will be eternally dear to him. He is desirous of annually commemorating this mournful event by a solemn service, for which
he requests vou to compose a requiem."
Mozart was forcibly strusck by this discourse, by the grave
mauiner in which it was uttered, and by the air of mystery
in which the whole was involved. He engaged to write the
reqliem..  The stranger continued, " Employ all your genius
on th' s work; it is destined for a connoisseur." -" So much
the better."--" What time do you require?"--" A month.""Very well; in a month's time I shall return-what price
do you set on your work?"  "A  hundred ducats."*-The
stranger counted them on the table, and disappeared.
Mozart remained lost in thought for some time: he then
suddenly' called for pen, ink and paper, and, in spite of
his wife's entreaties, began to write. This rage for compositiovr'ontinued several days; he wrote day and night, with
an -ardor,which seemed continually to increase; but his
constitution, already in a state of great debility, was unable
to support this enthusiasm; one morning he fell senseless,
and was obliged to suspend his work.  Two or three days
after, when his wife sought to divert his mind from  the
gloomy presages which occupied it, he said to her abruptly,
" It is certain that I am writing this requiem  for myself; it
will serve for my funeral service."  Nothing could remove
this impression from his mind.
As he went on, he felt his strength diminish from day to
lay, anc the score advancing slowly.  The month which he
had fixed being expired, the stranger again,made his appearance.  ~I have found it imposs;ble," said Mozart, " to
keep my word."  " Do not give yourself any uneasiness,"
replied the stranger; " what further time do you require?'
Pron dilk-its.
Lesson 95.]
2195-" Another month: the work has interested me more than I
exp?cted, and I have extended it much beyond what I at first
designed."-" In that case, it is but just to increase the pre
mium; here are fifty ducats more."--" Sir," said Mozart,
witli increasingr astonishment, " who then are you?"--" That
is nothing to the purpose  in a month's timie I shall return."
MIozart immediately called oine of his servants, and ordered him  to follow  this extraordinary personage, and find
out Nho he was; but the man failed from want of skill, and
returned nithout being able to trace him.
Poor Mozart vwas then persuaded that he was no ordinary
being; that he had a connexion with the other world, and
was sent to announce to him  his approaching end.-He applied himself with the more ardor to his requiem, which
he regarded as the most durable monument of his genius.
While thus employed, he was seized with the most alarming
fainting fits, but the work was at length completed before
the expiration of the month.  At the time appointed, the
stranger returned, but Mozart wvas no more.
His career was as brilliant as it was short.  HIe died before he had completed his thirty-sixth year; bu!t in this short
space of time he had acquired a name which will never
perish, so long as feeling hearts are to be founid

Of that wild land, beyond the golden wave,
Where I, not he, was doomed to be a slave;
Cold o'er his limbs the listless languor (rew;.
Paleness came o'er his eye of placid blue,
Pale mourned the lily where the rose had died,
And timid, trerobling, came he to my side.

LESSON XCVII.
Character of Mr. Jamnes WTatt.t
DEATH is still busy in our high places:--and it is with
great pain that we find ourselves called upon, so soon after
the loss of Mr. Playfair, to record the decease of another of
our illustrious countrymen,-and one to whom  mankind
has been still more largely indebted.  Mr. James Watt, the
great improver of the steam-engine, died on the 25th of
April, at his seat of Heathfield, near Birmingham, in the
84th year of his age.
This name fortunately needs no commemoration of ours;
for he that bore it survived to see it crownved with undisputed and unenvied honors; and many generations will
probably pass away befere it shall "have gathered all its
fame."   We have said tha.t Mlr. Watt was the great imnprover of the steam-engine; but, in truth, as to all that is
admirable in its structure, or vast in its utility, ha. should
rather be described as its inventor.  It -was by his inventions that its action was regulated so as to make it capable
of being applied to the finest and most delicate manufac* Pron. strow.
t The above beautiful tribute to the memory of the great inventor of the
steam-engine is abridged by MclDiarmid froml an article which appeared in
the " Scotsman" newspaper,-and whlich was ascribed to Francis Jeffrey, Esq

THE AMERICANtures, and. its power so increased as to set weight and solidity
at defiance.
By his admirable contrivances, and those of a kindred and
lamented genius in America,* it has become a thing stupendous alike for its force and its flexibility,-for the prodigious
power -'which it can exert, and the ease and  precision and
ductility with which it can be varied, distributed, and applied.  The trunk of an elephant that can pick up a plin or
rend an oak is as nothing to it.  It can engrave a seal, and
crush inasses of obdurate metal before it,-draw out, without
breakling, a thread as fine as gossamuer, and lift up a ship of
war like a. bauble in the air.  It can embroider muslin  and.
ffirge anchors,-cut steel into ribands, and  impel loaded
vessels against the fury of the winds and waves.
It would be difficult to estimate the value of the benefits
-which these inventions have conferred upon the country.There is no branch of industry that has not been indebted
to them; and in all the most material, they have not only
widened most nagnificently the field of its exertions, but
multiplied a thousand fold the amount of its productions.
It is our i:nproved steam-engine that hias fought the battles
of Europe, an.-  exalted and sustained, through the late tremendous corntest, the political greatness of our land.  It is
the same great power which. enables us to pay the interest of
our debt, and to maintain the arduous struggle in which we
are still engaged, wvith th.e skill and capital of countries less
oppressed with taxation.
But these are poor and narrow vievws of its importance.
It has increased indefinitely the mass of human comforts and
enjoyments, and rendered cheap and accessible all over the
world the materials of wealth and prosperity.  It has armed
the feeble hand of man, in short, with a power to which. no
limits can be assigned; completed the -dominion of mind
over the most refractory qualities of matter; and laid a sure
foundation for all those future miracles of mechanic po'wer
which are to aid and reward the labors of after generat-ions.
It is to the genius of one man, too, that all this is mainly
owing; and certainly no man ever before bestowed such a
gift on his kind.  The blessing is not only universal, but unbouinded; and the fabled inventors of the plotugh and the
loom, wvho are deified by the erring gratitude of their rude
contemp oraries, conferred less inlportant benefits on mlankind
than the i.ventor of our present steam-engine.

and it is sufficient for his race and his country.  But to
thlose to whom he more immediately belonged, who lived in
his society and enjoyed his conversation, it is not, perhaps,
the character in which he will be most frequently recalled
-most deeply lamented-or even most highly admired.Independently of his great train of attainments in the mechanics, Mr. Watt was an extraordinarv, and in manly
respects a wonderful man. Perhaps no individual in his age
possessed. so much and such varied and exact information-had
read so much, or remembered what he had read so accurately
and well.
He had infinite quickness of apprehension, a prodigious
memory, and a certain rectifying. and methodizing power of
understanding, which extracted something precious out of
all that was presented to it. His stores of miscellaneous
knowledge were immense--ai:d yet less astonishing than
tile command which he had at all times over them.  It
seemed as if every subject that was casually started in conversation with him, had been that wlhich he had been last
occupied in studying and exhausting; such was thl?a copiousness, the precision, and the admirable clearr.ess of the information which he poured out upon it without effort or
hesitation.

the branches of physical science, might perhaps have beer.

usual occupations, and  probably is not generally knovn,
that he was curiously learned in many branches of antiquity, metaphysics, medicine, and entomology, and perfectly
at home in all the details of architecture, music, and law.
He was well acquainted, too, with nlost of the modern languages-and familiar with their most recent literature.  Nor
was it at all extraordinary to hear the great mechanician and
engineer detailing and expounding, for hours together, the
metaphysical theories of the German logicians, or criticising
the measures or the matter of German poetry.
In his temper and dispositions he was not only kind and
affectionate, but generous and considerate of the feellhngs of
all around him, and gave the most liberal assistance and

the calm  and cheerful evening of life that he had been p- rmitted to enjoy, after the honoraLle labors of the day had

19He then spoke of his funeral, and cheerfully gave directions concerning the manner of his interment.  " There is
a spot," said he, "near the village of Dauphigny, which
would suit me nicely; you krnow it well, for I have often
said I should like to be buried there; and let me beg of
you, as you value your old friend, not to suffer any pomp to
be used at my burial; no:r any monument, nor monumental
inscription whatsoever to mark where I am  laid; deposit
me quietly in the earth, place a sun-dial over my grave, and
let rne be forgotten."
A  letter at this time arriving from  England, containing
pleasiing information of his son, it wvas read aloud by his
servant; upon the conclusion of which, Mr. Howard, turning his head, said, " Is not this comfort for a dying father?"
He then made the Admiral promise to read the service of
the Church of England over his grave, and that he should
be biuried in all respects according to the forms of his own
country.
Having succeeded in his application, the countenance of
Mlr. Howard brightened, a glearn of evident satisfaction carne
over his face, and he prepared to go to bed.  He then made
his will; shortly after which, symptoms of deliriumn appeared.
After this he ceased to speak.  A physician was called in,
who prescribed the musk draught. It was administered by
Admiral Mordvinof, who prevailed on Mr. Howard to swallow a little; but he refused the rest, evincing great disapprobation.  A rattling in the throat ensued, and he shortly
after breathed hlis last.
"I cannot name this gentleman," says Mr. Burke, " without remarking that his labors and writings have done much

He  was a stout-built, round-shouldered, squab-looking
man, of a bearish aspect.  His features were hard, and his
healt was harder.  You could read the interest-table in the
wrinkles of his brow, trace the rise and fall of stocks by
the look of hIis countenance; while avar',:e, selfishness, and
money-getting, glared from his gray, glassy eye.  Nature
had poured no lalmn ito o his breast; nor was his "gross and
earthly mould" susceptible of pity.  A single look of his
Wu.luld daunt the most impoitunate petitioner that ever attempted to extract hard coin by the soft rhetoric of a
heart-moving tale.
The wife of one whom  he had known in better days,
pleaded before him for her sick husband, and famishing infants.  Jacob, on occasions like these, was a man of few
words.  He was as chary of them as of his money, and he
let her come to the end of her tale without interruption.
She paused for a reply; but he gave none.  "Indeed, he is
very ill, Sir."--" Can't help it."--" We are very distressed."
--" Can't help it."-" Our poor children, too."
"Can't help tlhat neither."
The petitioner's eye looked a mournful reproach, which
would have interpreted itself to anv other heart but his,
"Indeed, you can;" but she was silent.  Jacob felt more
awkwardly than he had ever done in his life.  His hahd involuntarily scrambled  about his breeches' pocket.'here
was somethinr like the weakness of human nature stirring

into his hand-his fingers insensibly closed; but the effort
to draw  thein forth, and the impossibility of effecting it
without unclosillg  them, roused the dormnant selfishness of
his nature, and restored his self-possession.

The Highlntder.-W. GILLESPIE.
Many years azo, a poor Highland soldier, on his return to his native
hills, fatigued, as it was supposed, by tthe length of the march an(d
the heat of the weathler, sat down under the shade of a birch-tree, ois
the solitary road( of Lowrini, thlt winds along the mar!rin of Loch
Ken, in Galloway.   Here he was found dlead, and this incident
forms the subject of the following verses.
FRoii the ciimes of the sun, all war-worn and weary,
The Highlander sped to his youthful abode;
Fair visions of home cheered the desert so dreary;
Though fierce was the noon-beanm and steep was the road.
Till spent with the march that still lengthened before nim,
He stopped by the way in a sylvan retreat;
The light shady boughs of the birch-tree waved o'er him,
And the stream of the mountain fell soft at his feet.
He sunk to repose where the red heaths are blended,
One dream of his childhood his fancy past o'er;
But his battles are fought, and his nlarch.... it is en led;:
The sound of the bagpipe shall wake him no more.No arm in the aay of the conflict could wound him,
Though war lanched her thunder in fury to kill;
Now the angel of death in the desert has found him,
Now stretched him in peace by the stream of the hill.
Pale Autumn spreads o'er him the leaves of the forest,
The fays of the wild chant the dirge of his rest'
And thou, little brook, still the sleeper deplorest,
And moisteneth the heath-bell that weeps on his breast.

Yet wore one dusky hue;
The cranes upon the mosque
Kept their night-clatter still;
When through the gate the early traveller pass'd.
And when, at evening, o'er the swampy plain
The bittern's boom came far,
Distinct in darkness seen,
Above the low horizon's lingering light,
Rose the near ruins of old Babylon.
Once, from her lofty walls the charioteer
Looked down on swarming myriads; once she flung
Her arches o'er Euphrates' conquered tide,
And, through her brazen portals when she poured
Her armies forth, the distant nations looked
As men who watch the thunder-cloud in fear,
Lest it should burst above them.- She was fallen'

Lanced at the intruding staff her arrowy tongue.

Broken by many a mass of blackest shade;

LESSON CIV.
Daily Prayer.--Morning.--CANNING.
THE scriptures of the Old and New Testaments agree in
enjoining prayer. Let no man call himself a christian, who
lives without giving a part of life to this duty. We are not
taught how often we must pray; but our Lord in teaching
us to say, " Give us this day our daily bread," implies that
we-should pray daily. As to the particular hours to be given to this duty, every christian may choose them  for himself. Our religion is too liberal and spiritual to bind us to
any place or any hour of prayer. But there are parts of
the day particularly favorable to this duty, and which, if
possible, should be redeemed for it.
The first of these periods is the morning, which even nature seems to have pointed out to men of different religions,
as a fit time for offerings to the Divinity. In the morning
our minds are not so much shaken by worldly cares and
pleasures, as in other parts of the day. Retirement and
sleep have helped to allay the violence of our feelings, to
calm the feverish excitement so often produced by intercourse with men. The hour is a still one. The hurry and
tumults of life are not begun, and we naturally share in the
tranquillity around us. Having for so manly hours lost our
hold on the world, we can banish it more easily from the
mind, and worship with less divided attention.  This, then,
is a favorable time for approaching the invisible Auth(r of
our being, for strengthening the intimacy of our minds with
h-im, for thinking upon a future life, and for seeking those
spiritual aids which we need in the labors and temptat'ons
of every day.
In the morning there is much to feed the spirit of devotion. It offers an abundance of thoughts, friendly to pious
feeling. When we look on creation, what a happy and
touching change do we witness! A few hours past, the earth
was wrapt in gloom and silence  There seemed "a pause
LLesson 104,
Inzqfl  
THE AMERICANin nature."  But now, a new flood of light has broken forth,
and creation rises before us in fresher and brighter hues,
and seems to rejoice as if it had just received birth from its
Author.
The sun never sheds more cheerful beltms, and never
prochl.,ms more loudly God's glory and goodness, than when
he retarxns after the coldness and dampness of night, anri
awakens man and inferior animals to the various purposes
of their being.  A  spirit of joy seerrs breathed over the
earth and through the sky. It requires little effort of imagination to read delight in the kindled clouds, or in the
fields bright with dew. This is the time when we can best
feel and bless the Power which said, "let there be light;"
which " set a talernacle for the sun in the heavens," and
made him  the  dispenser of fruitfulness and  enjoyment
through all regions.
If we next look at ourselves, what materials does the
morning furnish for devout thought! At the close of the past
day, we were exhausted by our labors, and unable to move
without wearisome effort.  Our minds were slugcgish, and
could not be held to the most interesting objects.  From this
state of exhaustion, we sunk gradually into entire insensibility.  Our limbs becamne motionless; our senses were
shut as in death.  Our thoughts were suspended, or only
wandered confusedly and without aim.  Our friends, and
the universe, and God himself were forgotten.
And what a change does the morning bring with it! On
waking'we find, that sleep, the image of death, has silently
infused into us a new  life.  The weary limbs are braced
again.  The dim eye has become bright and piercing.  The
mind is returned from  the region of forgetfulness to its
old possessions.  Friends are met again with a new interest.  We are again capable of devout sentiment, virtuous
effort, and Christian hope.  With what subjects of gratitude,
then, does the morning furnish us?  Wre can hardly recall
the state of insensibility from which we have just emerged,
without a consciousness of our dependance, or think of the
renovation of our powers and intellectual being, without
feeling our obligration to God.
There is something very touching in the consideration, if
we will fix our minds upon it, that God thought of us when
we could not think; that he watched over us when we had
no power to avert peril from ourselves; that he continued
our vital motions, and in due time broke the chains of sleep.
Lesson 104.]Time never returns.
Marl how it snows! how fast the valley fills,
And the sweet groves the hoary garment wear;
Yet the warm sun-beams, bounding from the hills,
Shall melt the veil away, and the young green appear.
But when old age has on your temples shed
Her silver frost, there's no returning sun:
Swift flies our summer, swift our autumn's fled,
WVhen youth and love and spring and golden joys are gone.
A temple.
How reverend is the face of this tall pile,
Whose. ancient pillars rear their marble heads,
To bear aloft its arch'd and pond'rous roof,
By its own weight made steadfast and immovcable,
Looking tranquillity! It strikes an awe
And terror on my aching sight: the tombs
And monumental caves of death look cold,
And shoot a chiliness to my trembling heart.
A battle.
Now, shield with shield, with hemPet helmet clos'd,
To armor armor, lance to lance oppos'd,
Host against host the shadowy squadrons drew;
The sounding-darts, in iron tempests, flew.
Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,
And thrilling shouts and dying groans arise;
With streaming blood the slipp'ry fields are dy'd,
And' slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
Family devotion.
Lo, kneeling down to Heaven's Eternal King,
The saint, the father and the husband prays:
Hope springs exulting on triumphant wing
That thus they all shall meet in futua days:
There ever bask in uncreated rays,  7'
No more to sigh or shed the bitter tear,
Together hymning their Creator's praise,
In such society yet still more dear;
WThile circling Tirne moves round in an eternal sphere.
[Lesson 3.and set our imprisoned faculties free.  How fit is it, at thlis
hour, to raise to God the eyes which he has opened, and the
arm which he has strengthened; to acknowledge his providence; to consecrate to him  the powers he has renewed!
How fit that he should be the first object (f the thoughts
and afl'ections which lie has restored! How fit to employ
in his praise the tongue he has loosed, and the breath which
he has spared!
But the morning is a fit time for devotion, not only from
its relation to the past night, but considered as the introduction of a new day.  To a thinkingr mind, how natural at
this hour are such reflections as the followring:--I am now
to enter on a new period of my life, to start afresh in my
course.  I am to return to that world, where I have often
gone astra-y; to receive impressions which may never be
effaced; to perform actions which will never be forgotten;
to strei-gthen a character, which will fit me for heaven or
hell.  I am this day to meet temptations which have often
subdued me; I am to be entrusted again with opportunities
of usefulness, which I have often neglected.  I am to influence the minds of others, to help in moulding their characters, and in deciding the happiness of their present and
future life.  How  uncertain is this day! What unseen
dangers are before me! What unexpected changes may
await me! It may be my last day! It will certainly bring
me nearer to death and judgment!
Now, when entering on a period of life so important, yet
so uncertain, how fit and natural is it, before we take the
first step, to seek the favor of that Being on whom the lot
of every day depends; to commit all oiur interests to his
almighty and wise providence; to seek his blessing on our
labors, and his succor in temptation; and to consecrate to
his service the day which he raises upon us! This morning
devotion not only agrees with the sentiments of the heart,
hut tends to make the day happy, useful, and virtuous.
Having cast ourselves on the mercy and protection of the
Almighty, we shall go forth with new confidence to the labors and duties which he imposes.  Our early prayer will
help to shed an odor of piety through the whole life. God,
having first occupied, will more easily recur to our mind.
Our first step will be in the right path, anid we may hope a
happy issue.
So fit and useful is morning devotion, it ought not to be
omitted without necessity.  If our circumstances will allow
236
tLesson 104,
THE AMERICAN.,the privilege, it is a bad sign, when no part of the morning
is spent in prayer.  If God find no place in our minds at
that early and peaceful hour, he will hardly recur to us in
the tuniults of life.  If the benefits of the morning do not
soften us, we can hardly expect the heart to melt'with gratitude through the day.  If the world then rush in, and t. le
Fossession of us, when we are at some distance and have had
a respite from  its cares, how can we hop)e to shake it off,
when we shall be in the midst of it, pressed and agitated by
it on every side?
Let a part of the morning, if possible, be set apart to devotion; and to this end we should fix the hour of rising, so
that we may have an early hour at our own disposal.  Our
piety is suspicious, if we can renounce, as too many do, the
pleasures and benefits of early prayer, rather than forego
the senseless indulgence of unnecessary sleep.- Wlhat! we
can rise early enough for business.  We can even anticipate
the dawn, if a favorite pleasure or an uncommon gain requires the effort.  But we cannot rise, that we may bless our
great Benefactor, that we may arm  ourselves for the severe
conflicts to which our principles are to be exposed.  We
are willing to rush into the world, without thanks offered,
or a blessing sought. From a day thus begun, what ought
we to expect but thoughtlessness and guilt!
LESSON CV.
Daily Prayer.-Evening.-CHANNING.
LET us now consider another part of the day which is favorable to the duty of prayer; we mean the evening.
This season, like the.morning, is calm  and quiet.  Our labors are ended.  The bustle of life is gone by.  The distracting glare of the day.'as vanished.  The darkness wlhich
surrounds us favors seriou-iess, composure, and solemnity.
At night the earth fades from our sight, and nothing of creation is left us but the starry heavens, so vast, so magnificent, so serene, as if to guide up our thoughts above all
earthly things to God and immortality.
This period should in part be given to pra-er, as it furnishes a variety of devotional topics and excitements.  Thle
evening is the close of an important division of time, and is
Lessonr 105.]
2037therefore a fit and natural season for stopping and looking
back on the day.  And can we ever look back on a day
which bears no witness to God, and lays no claim to our
gratitude? Whlio is it that strengthens us for daily  labor,
gives us daily bread, continues our friends and commrnmn
pleasures, and grants us the privilege of retiring, afLer the
cares of the day,. to a quiet and beloved home?
The review of the day will often sugcest not only the"bordinary benefits, but peculiar proofs of God's goodness,
unlooked for euccesses, singular concurrences of favorable
even s, singular blessinigs sent to our friends, or new anid
powerful aids to our own virtue, which call for peculiar
thankfulness.  And shall all these benefits pass awav unnoticed?  Shall we retire to repose as insensible as the wearied brute?  Itow fit and natural is it, to close with pious
acknowledrgment, the day which has been filled with divine beneficence!
But the evening is the time to review, not ohly our blessings, but our actions.  A  reflecting mind will naturally renember at this hour that another day is gone, and gone to
testify of us to our judge.  How natural and useful i(nquire,
what report it has carried to heaven! Perhaps -1save the
satisfaction of looking back on a day, which in its general
teinor has been innocent and pure, whlich, having becrun with
God's praise, has been spent as in his presence; which has
proved the reality of our principles in,cmptation: and shall
such a day end without gratefully acknowledgingo Him in
whose strength we have been strong, and to whom we owe
the powers and opportunities of Christian improvement?
But no day will present to us recollections of purity unmixed with sin.  Conscience, if suffered to inspect faithfully and speak plainly, will recount irregular desires, and defective motives, talents wasted and time misspent; and shall
we let the day pass from  us without penitently confessing
our offences to Him who has witnessed them, and who has
promised pardon to true repentance?  Shall we retire to
rest with a burden of unlamented and unforgiven guilt upon
our consciences?  Shall we leave these stains to spread over
and sink into the soul?
A religious recollection of our lives is one of the chief instruments of piety.  If possible, no day should end without
it. If we take no account of our sins on the day on which
they are committed, can we hope that they will recur to us
at a more distant period, that we shall watch against them
238
[Lesson 105.
THE AMEERICA Nto-morrowv, or that we shall gain the strength to resist them,
vwhich we will not implore?
The evening is a fit time for prayer, not only as it ends
the day, but as it immediately prece(les the period of repose.
The hour of activity having passed, we are soon to sink
into insensibilty and sleep.  How fit that we resign ourselves to thie care of that Being who never sleeps, to whom
the darkness is as the light, and whose providence is our
only safety! How fit to entreat him  that he would keep us
to antother day; or, if our bed should prove our grave, that
he would give us a part in the resurrection of the just, and
awake us to a pu-rer and immnortal life!  Let our prayers,
like the incicnt sacrifices, ascend morning and evening.  Let
our days begin and end with God.

Affecting picture of constancy in love.-CRABBE.
YES! there are real mourners--I have seen
A fair, sad girl; mild, suffering, and serene;
Attention (through the day) her duties claimed,
And to be useful as resigned she aimed:
Neatly she dressed. nor vainly seemed to expect
Pity for grief, or pardon for neglect;
But when her nwearied parents sunk to sleep,
She sought her place to meditate and weep.
Then to her mind was all the past disolayed,
That faithful memory brings to sorrow's aid:
For then she thought on one regretted youth,
Her tender trust, and his unquestioned truth;
In every place she wandered, where they'd been
And sadly-sacred held the parting scene,
Where last for sea he took his leave;-that place
With double interest would she nightly trace.
For long the courtship was, and he would say
Each timne he sailed-this one, and then the day--
Yet prudence tarried, and when last he went,
He drew from pitying love a full consent.
Happy he sailed, and great the care she took,
That he should softly sleep, and snmartly look;
White was his better linen, and his check
Was made more trim than any on the deck;
And every comfort men at sea can know,
Was hers to buy, to make, and to bestow:
For he to Greenland sailed, and much he told,
How he should guard against the climate's cold,
Yet saw not' danger; dangers he'd withstood,
Nor could she trace the fever in his blood:
His messmates smiled at flushings in his cheek,
Anld he too smiled, but seldom would he speak;
For now he found the danger, felt the pain,
With grievous symptoms he could not explain.
He called his friend, and prefaced with a sigh
A lover's message--" Thomas, I must die:
Would I could see my Sally, and could rest
My' throbbing temples on her faithful breast,
And gazing go!-if not, this trifle take,
And say, till death I wore it for her sake:
2 1L"
[Lesson 10Q8Yes! I must die-blow on, sweet breeze, blow on'
Give me one look, before my life be gone,
Oh! give me that! and let me not despair,One last, fond look!-and now repeat the prayer."
He had his wish-had more; I wTill not paint
The lovers' meeting: she beheld him faintWith tender fears, she took a nearer view,
Her terrors doubling as her hopes withdrew;
He tried to smile; and, half succeeding, said,
" Yes! I must die"-and hope for ever fled.
Still, long she nursed him; tender thoughts meantime
Were interchanged, and hopes and views sublime.
To her he came to die, and every day
She took sonle portion of the dread away;
WTith him she prayed, to him his Bible read,
Soothed the faint heart, and held the aching head:
She came with smiles the hour of pain to cheer;
Apart she sighed; alone she shed the tear;
Then, as if breaking from a cloud, she gave
Fresh light, and gilt the prospect of the grave.
One day he lighter seemed, and they forgot
The care, the dread, the anguish of their lot;
They spoke with cheerfu}ness, and seemed to think,
Yet said not so-" perhaps he will not sink."
A sudden brightness in his look appeared,
A sudden vigor in his voice was heard;She had been reading in the Book of Prayer,
And led him forth and placed him in his chair;
Lively he seemed; and spoke of all he knew,
The friendly many, and the favorite few;
Nor one that day did le to mind recall,
But she has treasured, and she loves them all;
When in her way she meets them, they appear
Peculiar people-death has made them dear.
He named his friend, but then his hand she pressed,
And fondly whispered " Thou must go to rest."
"I go," he said; but as he spoke, she found
His hand more cold, and fluttering was the sound;
Then gazed affrightened; but she caught a last,
A dying look of love, and all was past!
She placed a decent stone his grave above,
Neatly engraved-an offering of her love;
For that she wrought, for that forsook her bed,
Awake alike to duty and the dead;

The least assistance--'twas her proper care.

Then go again, and thus her hour employ,
While visions please her, an'd while woes destroy.

years of manhood, is to settle himself in the wvorld-which
means nothing more than to begin his rambles.  To this
end, he takes to himself for a wife some buxom  country
heiress, passing rich in red ribands, glass beads and mock
tortoise-shell combs, with a white gown and morocco shoes
13r Sunday, and deeply skillied in the mystery of making,.pple-sweetmeats, long sauce, and pumpkin pie.  Having
ihus provided himself, like a pedlar, with a heavy knapsack, wherewith to regale his shoulders throuch the journey of life, he literally sets out on his peregrinations.
His whole family, household furniture, and farming utensils, are hoisted into a covered cart; his own and wife's
wardrobe packed up in a firkin-which done, he shoulders
his axe, take staff in his hand, whistles "Yankee doodle,"
and trudges off to the woods, as confident of the protection
of Providence, and relying as cheerfully on his owin resour'ces, as ever did a patriarch of vore, when he journeyed
into a stran(ge country of the Getltiies.  Having buried himself in the wilderness, he builds himself a log-hut, clear,
away a corn-field and potato-patch, and. Providence smil
ing utpon his labors, he is soon surrounded by a snaug farm,
andt somne half a score of flaxen-headed urchins, who, by
thleir size, seem to have sprung all at once out of the earth,
like a crop of toadstools.
But it is not the nature of this most indefatigable of speculators to rest contented with any state of sublunary enjoymerit: improvement is his darling  passion; and  having
thus improved hlis lands, the next state is to provide a
mansion worthy the residence of a landholder. A huge
244
rLesson 109.
THE AMIERICANpalace of pine-boards, immedid/'ely springs up in the midst
of the wilderness, large enough for a parish church, and
furnished with windows of all dimensions; but so rickety
and flimsy withal, that every blast gives it a fit of the ague
By the time the outside of this mighty air-castle is completed, either the funds or the zeal of our adventurer are exhausted, so that he barely manages to half finish one room
within, where the whole family burrow  together, while the
rest of the house is devoted to the curing of pumplkins, or
storing of carrots and potatoes, ancd is decorated With fanciful festoons of dried apples and peaches.
The outside remaining unpainted, grows venerably black
with time; the family wardrobe is laid under contribution
for old hats, petticoats, and breeches to stuff into the broken
windows; while the four winds of heaven keep up a whistling and howling about the aerial palace, and play as many
unruly gambols as they did of yore in the cave of iEolus.
The humrble log-hut, which whilom  nestled this improving
family snugly  within its narrow  but comfortable  walls,
stands hard by, ignominious con'trast! degraded into a cowhouse or pig-sty; and the whole scene reminds one forcibly
of a fable, which I am  surprised has never been recorded,
of an aspiring snail, who abandoned his humble habitation,
which he had long filled with great respectability, to crawl
into the empty shell of a lobster, where he could no doubt
have resided with great style and splendor, the envy and
hate of all the pains-taking snails in his neighborhood, had
he not accidentally perished with cold in one corner of his
stupendous mansion.
Being thus completely settled, and, to use his own words,
"to rights," one would imagine that he would begin to enjoy the comforts of his situation, to read newspapers, to talk
politics, n6glect his own business, and attend to the affairs
of the nation, like a useful or patriotic citizen; but now it
is that his wayward disposition again begins to operate.  He
soon grows tired of a spot where there is no longer any room
for improvement, sells his farm-his air-castle, petticoatwindows and all, reloads his cart, shoulders his axe, puts
himself at the head of his family, and wanders away in
search of new lands, again to fell trees, again to clear cornfields, again to build a shingle-palace, and again to sell off,
and w\ander.

The Chinese Prisoner.-PERcrvAL.
A CERTAIN emperor of China, on his accession to the throne
of his ancestors, commanded a general release of all those
who were confined in prison for debt. Amongst that number was an old man, who had fallen an early victim to adversity, and whose days of imprisonment, reckoned by the
notches which he had cut on the door of his gloomy cell, expressed the annual circuit of more than fifty suns.
With trembling limbs and faltering steps, he departed from
his mansion of sorrow: his eyes were dazzled with the splendor of the light; and the face of nature presented to his
view a perfect paradise. The jail in which he' had been
imprisoned, stood at some distance from  Pekin, and to that
city he directed his course, impatient to enjoy the caresses
of his wife, his children, and his friends.
Having with difficulty found his way tothe street in which
his decent mansion had formerly stood, his hearf became more
and more elated at every step he advanced. With joy he
proceeded, looking eagerly around; but he observed few of
the objects with which he4had been formerly con'versant. A
magnificent edifice was erected on the site of the house
which he had inhabited; the dwellings of his neighbors
had assumed a new form; and he beheld not a single face of
wh   he had the least remembrance.
/Xn aged beggar who with trembling kinees stood at the
gate of a portico, from which he had been thrust by the insolent domestic who guarded it, struck his attention. He
stopped, therefore, to give him a small pittance out of the
bounty with which he had been supplied by the emperor,
and received, in return, the sad tidings, that his wife had
fallen a lingering sacrifice to penury and sorrow; that his
children were gone to seek their fortunes in distant or unknown climes; and that the grave contained his nearest and
most valuable friends.
Overwhelmed with anguish, he hastened to the palace of
his sovereign, into whose presence his hoary locks and
mournful visage soon obtained admission; and casting himself at the feet of the emperor, " Great Prince;"-l:  cried,

On the dangers of moral sentiment, unaccompanied with active
virtlue.-ALISON.
OF the vario-as appearances of melancholy weakness in
youth, none is more general or more fatal to exvery duty or
hope of the christian, than that, where the youthful taste is
exalted above the condition in which life is to be passed.
The faithful parent, or the wise instructer of the young, will
ever assiduously accommodate the ideas of excellence to the
actual circumstances and the probable scenes in which their
future years are to be engaged; and every condition of' life
undoubtedly affords opportunities for the highest excellence
of which our nature is'susceptible.  If, on the other hand,
these hours are neglected,-if the fancy of youth be suffered
to expand into the regions of visionary perfection,-if cornpositions, which nourish all these chinierical opinions, are
permitted to, hold an undue share in the studies of the
young,-if, what is far more, no employments of moral labor
and intellectual activity are afforded them to correct this
progressive indolence, anld give strength and energy to their
opening  minds, there is much danger that the seeds of
irreme'diable evil are sown, and that the future harvest of
life will be only feebleness, and contempt, and sorrow.
If, in the first place, it is to the common duties o.f life
they advance, how  singularly unprepared are they for their
discharge! In all ranks and conditions, these duties are the
same;-every where sacred in the eyes of God and man;every where requiring activity, and firmness, and perseverance of mind;-and every where only to be fulfilled by the
deep sense of religious obligation.  For such scenes, however, of common trial and of universal occurrence, the
characters we are considering are ill prepared.-Their habits have given them no energy or activity;-their studies
have enlightened their imaginations, but not, warmed their
hearts;-their anticipations of action have been upon a romantic theatre, not upon the humble dust of mortal life.
It is the fine-drawn scenes of visionary aistress to which
they have been accustomed, not the plain  circumnstances of
common wretchediness.-It is the momentarv exertions of
generosity or greatness which have elevated their fancy,
not the long and patient struggle of pious duty.-It. is before
246
[Lesson 110.an admiring world that they have hitherto conceived them.
selves to act, not in solitude and obscurity, amid the wants
of poverty, the exigencies of disease, or the deep silence of
domestic sorrow.-ITs it wonderful that characters of this
enfeebled kind shotlid sometimes recoil from  the duties to
which they are called, and which appear to them in colors
so uinexpected?--tiat they should consider the world as a
gross and vulgar scene, uinworthy of their interest, and its
comlmon obiigations as something beneath them to perforrn;
and  that, with an affectation  of proud superiority, they
should wish to retire from a field in which they have the
presump.tion  to think it is fit onlv for vulgar minds to
combat?
If these are the opinions Nwhich they form  on their entrance upon the Nworld and all its stern realities, it is tie
" fountain from which many waters of bitterness will flow.'
Youth may pass in indolence and imagination, but life must
necessarily be active; and what must be the probable character of that life which begins with disgust at the simple,
but inevitable duties to which it is called, it is not difficult
to determine.
From hence come many classes of character with which
the world presen-ts us, in what we call its higher scenes,
and which it is imipossible to behold without a sentiment of
pity, as well as of indignation; in some, the perpetual affectation of sentiment, and the perpetual absence of its reality;
in others, the warm  admiration of goodness, and the cold
and indignant performance of their own most sacred duties;
in some, that childish belief of their own superior refinement, wEich leads them  to withdraw  from  the common
scenes of life and of business, and to distinguish themselves
only by capriciotus opinions and fantastic lanners; and in
others, of a bolder spirit, the proud rejection of all the duties and decencies which belong only to common men,--the
love of that distinction in vice wvhic'h they feel themselves
unable to attain in virtue, and the gradual but too certain
advance to the last stages of guilt, of impiety, arnd of wretchedness.  Such are sometimes the "issues" of a once prornising youth! and to these decrees of folly or of guilt, let the
e-arents and the instructers of the young ever remember,
what those infant hearts may come, which have not been
kept with all diligence," and early exercised in virtuous
activity.
Amid these delulsions of fancy, life. meanwhile, with all

FIRST CLASS BOK.1its plain and se:iov, business, is passing;--their contemporaries, in every line, are starting, before them in the road
of honor, of fortune, or of usefulness; and nothing is now
left them  but to concentrate all the vigror of their minds to
recover the ground,which they have lost.   But if this last
eunery be wvantinog, if whiat they " would," they yet fail to
"do," what, alas! can be the termination of the once ardent
and aspiring mind, but ignominy and di,grace!-a heart
dissatisfied with mankind anrid with itself; a conscience sicklening at the review of what is passed; a failing fortune; a degra(led character; and, -what I ftear is ever the last and the
most frantic refuge of selfish and disappointed anlbition,infidelity and despair.
It is ever painful to trace the history of human degradat.on, and it would even be injurious to religion and virtue to
do it, if it were  not at the same time to exhibit the means
by which these evils may be prevented.  Of the character
which I have now attempted to illustrate, the origin may be
expressed in one word;--it is in the forgetfulness of duty,
i, the forgetfulness that every power, and advantage, and
possession of our being, are only trusts committed to us
for an end, not properties which  we are to dispose of at
pleasure;-in the forgetfulness thiat all our imaginary virtues are  "nothing worth," unless they spring from  the
genuine  and permanent source of moral and  religious
obligation.
WVherever, indeed, we look around us upon general life,
we may every where see, that nothing but the deep sense of
religion can produce either consistency or virtue in human
conduct.  The world deceives us on one side-our imaginations on another,--our passions upon all.  Nothing could
save us; nothing, with such materials, could hold tog'ether
even the fabric of society, but the  preservation of that
deep and instinctive sense of duty, which the Father of
nature hath mercifiully gWen to direct and illuminate us in
every relation of life; whiclh is " none other" than hib own
voice; to which all our other powers, if they aim either alt
wisdoin or at virtue, mnust be stibservient; and which leads
us, if we listen to it, to every tlhing for which we were called
into being, either Lhere or hereafter.

Infidelity.-ANDrEw THOMPSON.
WE have heard, indeed, cf men who affected to hold fast
by the tenets of natura' rvlig;ion, while they repudiated those
of divine revelation; but -;,e hLve never been so fortunate
as to see and converse with otne of tilem  whose creed, select, and circumscribed, and palatable as he had made it,
seenled to have any serious footing in his mind, or any
practical influence oin his life; who could restrain his sneer
at piety the most untinctured  with  enthusiasm; or who
could check his speculations, however hostile to the system
he had affected to embrace; or who worshipped the God in
whose existence and attributes he acknowledged his belief;
or who acted with a view to that immortality for which he
allowed that the soul of man is destined.
It is true the votaries of infidelity are often placed in circumstances which constrain them  to hold such language,
and maintain such a deportment, as by itself might indicate
the presence of Christian principle.  They are frequently
not at liberty to give that full play, and that unreserved
publicity to their unbelief, in which, however, it is naturally
disposed to indulgre, and in which it would undoubtedly
manifest itself, were it free to operate at large.  And you
may not therefore, at particular times, and in particular
situations, perceive any marked distinction between them
and the devoted followers of Jesus of Nazareth.
They may have a farmily, and in the tenderness of parental
affection, and with the conviction that what they regard as
altogether false may contribute as much to the virtue and
happiness of their children as if it were altogether true,
they may shrink from  any declaration of infidelity within
the domestic circle.  They may acknowledge, in the season of their own distress, or they- may suggest, amid the
distresses of their friends, thoseeonsiderations to which
the mind, Nwhen softened or when agitated by affliction,
naturally clinTs, even though it has no habitual conviction
of their truth. and no proper title to the consolation which
they afford.  They may be driven by bodily anguish, or by
irnpending danger, to utter the langulage of a piety, which,
till that moment, was a stranger even to their lips, just as
the mariner has been known, amidst the perils and horrors of a shipwreck, to cry for mercy from  that God whose
existence he had never before confessed, but by his-pro.

249faneness and his blasphemies. Or they may even be strongIv and insensibly induced to accommodate themselves to
prevailing customs, and to pay an outward homage to the
faith of the New Testament. by occasionally attending its
institutions, though they are all the while regarding it as a
mere harmless fable, if not as a contemptible or a pernicious superstition.
But look at them when placed in those circumstances
whlich put ifo such restraints upon What they may say and
do as the enemies of Christianity; observe them when the
pride of intellect tempts them to display their learning or
their ingenuity in contending against the vul(gar faith-or
when they have a passion to gratify which needs the aid of
some principle to vindicate its indulgence-or when they
have nothing to fear from  giving utterance to what thev
think and feel-or when they happen to be associated with
those among whom the quality of freethinking prevailsobserve theIn as to the language which they employ, and
the practice which ihey maintain with respect to religion,
in the ordinary course and tenor of their lives; and then
say what positive proofs they give you of the reality or of
the efficacy of those religious principles which they profess
to have retained, af..r putting away from them the doctrine
of Clhrist.
Say, if instead of affording you positive proofs of such
r;m'anent and distinctive piety, they are not displaying daily
and inveterate symptoms that G-od, and Providence, and
immortality, are not in all their thoughts.  Say, if you
have not seen nmany  a melancholy demonstration of that
general irreligion which we have ascribed to them  as the
consequence of their throwingg off the dominion of the Gospel. And say if you have not been able to trace this down
through all the gradations of infidelity, from the speculative
philosopher, wvho has decided that there is no Savior, till
you come to the fool, Oio says, in the weakness and the
wickedness of his heart, that there is no God.
LESSON  CXII.
Same subject-concluded.
IT is amidst trials and sorrows that infidelity appears In
its justest and most frightful aspect. When subjected to the
[Lesson 112.
mzo0multifarious ills whicn flesh is heir to, what is there to uphold our spirit, but the discoveries and the prospects that
are unfolded to us by revelation?  What, for this purpose,
can be compared with the belief that every thing here below is under the manaagement of infinite wNisdom and goodness, and that there is an immortality of bliss awaiting us
in another world?  If this conviction be taklen avway, what
is it that we can have recourse to, on which the mind may
patiently and safely! repose in the season of adversity?
Where is the balm  which I may apply with effect to my
wounded heart, after I have rejected the aid of the Almigihty
Physician?
Imnpose upon me whatever hardships you please; give me
nothing  but the tread of sorrow  to eat; take froin me the
friends in whom I had placed my confidlence; lay me in the
cold hut of poverty, and on the'horny bed of disease; set
death before me in all its terrors; do all this,-only let me
trust in my Savior, and I will " fear no evil,"-I will rise
superior to affliction,-I will " rejoice in my tribulation."
But let infidelity interpose between God and my' soul, and
draw  its impenetra,ble veil over a fiuture state of existence,
and limit all my trust to the creatures of a day, and all rmy
expectations to a few years as uncertain as they are short,
and how shall I bear up, with fortitude or with cheerfulness, under the burden of distress?  Or where shall I find
one drop of consolation to put into the bitter draught which
has been giver me to drink?  I look over the wihole rtn'rge
of this wvilderness in which I dwell, tbut I'see not one covert
from the storm, nor one leaf for the healing of my soul, nor
one cup of cold wtater to refresh me in the -weariness and
the faintings of my pilgrimage.
The very conduct of infidels, in spreiading their system
with so much eagerness and induaitry, affords a striking proof
that its influence is essentially hostile to human happiness.
For what is their conduct?  WTh lhey  allow that religion
contrib'utes largely to the comfort of nan,-that in this respect, as well as,with respect to morality, it would be a great
evil were it to lose its hold over their affections,-and that
those are no friends to the world who wouldt shake or destroy their belief in it.  And yet, in the very face of this
acknowledgment, they scruple not to publish their doubts
and their unbelief concerning it amonog their fellow-men,
and with all the cool deliberation of philosophy, and sometimes witll all the keenness and ardor of a zealot, to do t.h",
Lesson 112.]
251very thing which they profess to deprecate as pernicious to
the well-being and comfort of the species.  Whether they
are sincere in this profession, or whether they are only
trifling with the,ense and fee'lng cf mlankind, still it demon'strates the hardening influence of their principles; and
from principles, which nrake tthose who hlold them so reckless of the peace and order and happiness of their brethren,
what can be reasonably expected, but every thing which is
mrost destructive of human comfort?
It is true, the infidel may be very humane in the intercourse of life; but, after all, what dependence can be
placed upon that humanity of his, which deals out bread to
the hungry, and clothing to the naked, and yet would sacrifice to literary vanity, or to something vw9rse, whatever can
give support in trial, and consolation at death? HIe may
sympathize with me in my distress, and rypeak to me of irni
mortality, and, at the very moment, l;s con.titutional kindness may be triumphing over his c,le -bloo&amp;ed and gloomy
speculations. But his speculations have shed a misery over
my heart, which no language oi hi~ can dissi-ate, and which
makes his most affectionate words sound in my ear like the
words of mockery and scorn.
He has destroyed me, and he cannot save me, and he
cannot comfort me.  At his bidding' I have renounced that
Savior in whom I once trusted and was happy, and he now
T ties me;--as if his most pitying tones could charm  away
the anguish of my bosom, and make me forget that it was
he himself who planted it there, and planted it so deep,
and nourished it so well, that nothingr but the power of
that heaven, whose power I have denied, is able to pluck it
out!
Yes, after he has destroyed my belief in the superintending providence of God,--after he has taught me that the
prospect of a hereafter is but the baseless fabric of a vision,
-.after he has bred anr  nourished in me a contempt for
that sacred volume which alone throws light over this benighted world,-after having argued nie out of my faith by
his sophistries, or laughed me out of it by his ridicule,-after
having thus wrung from my soul every drop of consolation,
and dried up my very spirit within me,-yes, after having
accomplished this in the season of my health and my prosperity, he would come to.me while I mourn, and treat me.like a drivelling idiot, whom he may sport with, because he

FIRST CLASS BQQJ.LESSON CXVIII.
Remarkcs on thle pegriskable nature of poetical fame.--JEFFREY.
[Fromn a Review of Campbell's Specimlens of British Poets.]
NEsT to the impression of the vast fertility, compass, and
beauty of our English poetry, tle reflect/on that recurs
most frequently and forcibly to us, in accompanying Mr.
Campbell through his wide survey, is the perishable nature
of poetical fame, and the speedy oblivion that has overtaken
so many of the promised heirs of immortality.  Of near
two hundred and fifty authors, whose works are cited in
these volumes, by far the greater part of whom were celebrated in their generation, there are not thirty who now
enjoy any thing that can be called popularity--whose works
are to be found in the hands of ordinary readers-in the
shops of ordinary booksellers-or in the press for republication.  About fifty more may be tolerably familiar to men
of taste or literature-the rest slunmber on the shelves of
collectors, and are partially known to a few antiquaries and
scholars.
Now, the fame of a poet is popular, or nothing.  He
does not address himself, like the man of science, to the
learned, or those who desire to lealrn, but to all mankind
and his purpose being to delight and to be praised, necessarily extends to all who can receive pleasure, or join in applause.  It is strange, and somewhat humiliatin(r, to see how
great a proportion of those who had once fought their way
successfully to distinction, and surmounted the rivalry of
contemporary envy, have again sunk into neglect.  We have
great deference for public opinion; and readily admit that
nothing but what is good can be permanently popular.-But
while we -would foster all that it bids to live, we would willingly revive much that it leaves to die.  The very multiplication of works of amusement necessarily withdraws many
from  notice that deserve to be kept in remembrance, for
we should soon find it labor, and not amusement, if we
were obliged to make use of them all, or even to take all
upon trial.
As the materials of enjoyment and instruction accumulate
dround us, more and more must thus be daily rejected and
left to waste: fp,hile our tasks lengthen, our lives remain
as short as ever-;" an  the calls on our time multiply, while
our time itself is 1fiingr.swiftly away.  This superfluity and
[Lesson 118abundance of our treasures, therefore, necessarily renders
much of them worthless; and the veriest accidents may, in
such a case, determine what part shall be preserved, and
what tllrown away and neglected.  When an army is decimated, the very bravest may fall; and many poets, worthy
of eternal remembrance, have been forgotten, merely because there was not room in our memories for all.
By such a work as the " Specimens," however, this injustice of fortune may be partly redressed-some small fragments of an immortal strain may still be rescued from oblivion-and a wreck of a name preserved, which time appeared to have swallowed up for ever.  There is something
pious, we think, and endearing, in the office of thus gathering up the ashes of renown that has passed away; or rather,
of calling back the departed life of a transitory glow, and
enabling those great spirits which seemed to be laid for
ever, still to draw  a tear of pity, or a throb of admniration,
from  the hearts of a forgetful generation.  The body of
their poetry, probably, can never be revived; but some
sparks of its spirit may yet be preserved in a narrower and
feebljer frame.
When we look back upon the havoc which two hundred
years have thus made in'the ranks of oulr immortals,--and,
above all, when we refer their rapid disappearance to the
quick succession of new  competitors, and the accumulation
of more good works than there is time to peruse,--we cannot help being dismayed at the prospect which lies before
the writers of the present day.  There never was an age so
prolific of popular poetry as that in which we now live,and as wealth, population, and education extend, the pr6'd*e is likely to go on increasing.
The last ten years have produced, we think, an annual
supply of about ten thousand lines of good staple poetry--
poetry from the very first hands that we can boast of-that
runs quickly to three or four large editions-and is as likely
to be permanent as present success can make it. Now, if
this goes cn for a hundred years longer, what a task will
await teie poetical readers of 1919! Our living poets will
then be nearly as old as Pope and Swift are at presentbuftthere will stand between them and that generation nearly
ten times as much fresh and fashionable poetry as is now
interposed between us and those writers:-and if Scott, and
Byron, and Campbell, have already cast Pope and Swift a
good deal into the shade, in what form and dimensions are

they themselves likely to be presented to the eyes of their
great-grandchildren?
The thouglht, we owvrn, is a little appalling; and, we confess, we see nothing better to imagine than that they may
find a comfortable place in some new collection of specimens
-the cen'tenary of the present publication.  There--if the
future editor have any thing like the indulgence and veneration for antiquity of his predecessor-there shall posterity
still hang with rapture on the half of Campbell-and the
fourth part of Byron-and the sixth of Scott and the scatteredtythes of Crabbe-and the three per cent. of Southey,
--hile some good-natured critic shall sit in our mouldering chair, and more than half prefer them to those by whom' have been superseded!: is an hyper'b6le of gooct ature, however, we fear, to
ascribe to them even those d4mensions at the end of a cen,
tury. After a lapse of 250 yeas, wve:re afraid to think of
the space they may have shrunlc into, W:e- have no Shakspeare, alas! to shed a never-setting light on his contempo,

given up in despair.
LESSON CXIX.
The RId- Stone. -V,ILsoN.
THEn coffin was let down to the bottom of the grave, the
planks were removed from  the heaped-up brink, the first
rattling clods had struck their knell, the quick shovelling
was over, and the long, broad, skilfully cut pieces of turf
were aptly joined together, and trimly laid by the beating
spade, so that the newest mound in the church-yard was
scarcely distingcuishable from those that.were grown over
by the undisturbed grass and daisies of a luxuriant spring.
The burial was soon over; and the party, with one consenting motioln, having uncovered their heads, in -decent reveren'ce of the place and occasion, were beginning to separate, and about to leave the church-yard.
Here, some acquaintances, from  distant parts of the
parish, who had not had opportunity of,ddressing each
other in the house that had belonged to the deceased, nor
262in the course of the few hundred yards that the little procession had to move over from his bed to his grave, were
shaking hands quietly but cheerfully, and inquiring'ifter the
welfare of each other's -families. There, a small knot of
neighbors were  speaking, without exaggeration, of the
respectable character which the deceased had borne, and
menticning to one another little incidents of his life, some of
them so remote as to be known only to the gray-headed persons of the groupe; while a few yards farther removed
from the spot, were standing together parties who discussed
ordinary concerns, altogether unconnected with the funeral,
such as the state of the markets, the promise of the season,i
or change of tenants; but still with a sobriety of manner
and voice, that was insensibly produced by the influence of
the simple ceremony now closed, by the quiet graves around,
and the shadow of the spire and (ray walls of the house of
God.
Two men yet stood together at the head of the grave,
with  countenances of sincere, but uniZpassioned  grief.
They were brothers, the only sons of"i h   who had been
buried. And there was soniething in their situationjJhat
naturally kept the eyes ofti.nany directed upon them. far a
long time, and more intently, than would }ave been the case,
had there been nothing more observable-about them than
the common symptoms of a common sorrow.  But'these two
brothers, who were now standing at the'head of their father's grave, had for some years been totally estringed from
each other, and the only words that had passed between
them, during all that time, had been uttered within a few
days past, during the necessary preparuations for the old
man's funeral.
No deep and deadly quarrel was between these brothers,
and neitherl *- them  could distinctly tell the cause of this
unnatural estrangement.  Perhaps dim  jealousies of their
father's favor-selfish thoughts that will sometimes force
themselves into poor men's hearts, respecting tePmporal expectations-unaccommodating  manners  on  1o3th  sides-.
taunting words that mean little when uttered, but xvvlich
rankle and fester in remembrance-imagined opposition of
interests, that, duly considered, would have been found one
and the same-these, and many other causes, slight when
single, but strong when rising up together in one baneful
band, had gradually but fatally infected their hearts, till
at 15ast they who in youth had been seldom separate, and
263

FIPST CLASS BOOK.truly attached, now met at market, and, miserable to say,
at church, with dark and averted faces, like difibrent clansrnen during a feud.
Surely if any thing could have softened their hearts towards each other, it must have been to stand silently, side
by side, while the earth, stones, and clods, wrere falling
down upon their father's coffin. And doubtless their hearts
were so softened.  But pride, though it cannot prevent the
holy affections of nature from being felt, may prevent them
from being showvn; and these two brothers stood there together, determined not to let each other know the mutual
tenderness that, in spite of them, was Oushing lip in their
hearts, and teaching them the unconfessed folly and wickedness of their causeless quarrel.
A head-stone had been prepared, and a person came forward to plant it.  The elder brother directed him  how to
place it-a plain stone with a sand-glass, skull, and crossbones, chiselled not rudely, and a few  words inscribed.
The younger brQther regarded the operation with a troubled eye, and sa,, loudly enough to be heard by several
of e  by-standers, " William, this was not kind in you; you
shduld have told me of this. I loved my father as well as
you could love him.  You were the elder, and, it may be,
the favorite son;'but I had a right in nature to have joined
you in orlnering this head-stone, had I not?"
During these words, the stone was sinking into the earth,
and many persons who were on their way from the grave
returned.  For a while the elder brother said nothing, for
he had a consciousness in his heart that he ought to have
consulted his father's son in designing this last becoming
mark of affection and respect to his memory, so the stone
was planted in silence, and now stood erect, decently and
simply among the other unostentatious memorials of the
humble dead.
The inscription merely gave'the name and age of the
deceased, and told that the stone had been erected "by his
affectionate sons."  The sight of these words seemed to
soften the displeasure of the angry man, and he said, somevhat more mildly, "Yes, we were his affectionate sons,
and since my name is on the stone, I am satisfied, brother.
We have not drawn together kindly of late yoars, and perhaps never may; but I acknowledge and  respect your
worth; and here, before our own friends, and before the
Iriends of our father, with my foot above his head, I express
264
C THE AMIERICAN
[Lesson 1 1 9.my willingness to be on other and better terms with you,
and if wre cannot command love in our hearts, let us, at
least, brother, bar out all iunklindness."
The minister, who had attencded the funeral, and had
something entrusted to him  to say publicly before he left
the church-yard, now came forward, and asked the elder
brother, why he spake not refgarding this matter.  He saw
that there was something of a cold, and sullen pride rising
up in his heart, for not easily may any man hope to disnliss from  the chabmber of his heart even the vilest guest,
if once cherished there.   With a solemn, and almost severe
air, he looked upon the relenting mdn, and then, changing
his countenance into serenity, said gently,
Behold how good a thingl it is,
And how becoming well,
Together such as brethren are,
I1 unity to dwell.
The time, the place, and this beautiful expression of a
natural sentiment, quite overcame a heart, in which many
kind, if not warm, affections dwelt; and the man thus appealed to, bowed down his head and wept.  "Give me
your hand, brother;" and it was given, while a murmur of
satisfaction arose from  all present, and all hearts felt lindlier and more humanely towards each other.
As the brothers stood fervently, but composedly, grirsping
each other's hand, in the little hollow that lay between the
grave of their mother, long since dead, and of their father,
whose shroutd was haply not yet still from  the fall of dust
to dust, the minister stood beside them  with a pleasant
countenance, and, said, "I must fulfil the promise I made
to your father on his death-bed.  I must read to you a few
words which his handl  wrote at an hour when his tongue
denied its office. I must not say that you did your duty to
your old father; for did he not often beseech you, apart
from one another, to be reconciled, for your own sakes as
Christians, for his sake, and for the sake of the mother who
bare you, and, Stephen, who died that you might be born?
When the palsy struck him for the last time, you were both
absent, nor was it your fault that you were not beside the
old man when he died.
"As long as sense continued with him here, did he think
of yon two, and of you two alone.  Tears were in his eyes;
I saw them  there, and on his cheek too, when no breath
came from his lips.  But of this no more.  He died with

warm ruins, spread over the now naked plain.
The ear is filled with the confused bellowing of oxen, and
sad bleating of over-driven sheep; they are swept from
their peaceful plains; with shouting and goading are they
driven-away; the peasant folds his arms, and resigns his
faithful fellow-laborers.
The farmer weeps over his barns consumed by fire, and
his demolished roof, and anticipates the driving of the winter snows.
On that rising grolund, where the green turf looks black
with fire, yesterday stood a noble mansion:; the owner had
said in his heart, here will I spend the evening of my days,
and enjoy the fruit of my years of toil: my name shall descend with mine inheritance, and my children's children
shall sport under the trees which I have planted.--The
fruit of his years of toil is swept away in a moment; wasted, not enjoyed; and the evening of his days is left desolate.
The temples are profaned: the soldier's curse resounds
in the house of God: the marble pavement is trampled by
iron hoofs: horses neigh beside the altar.
Law  and order are forgotten: violence and rapine are
abroad: the golden cords of society are loosed.
Here are The shriek of wo and the cry of anguish; and
there is suppressed indignation bursting the heart with silent despair.
The groans of the wounded are in the hospitals, and by
the road-side, and in every thicket; and the housewife's
web, whiter than snow, is scarcely sufficient to stanch the
blood of her husband and children.-Look at that youth,
the first-born of her strength; yesterday he bounded as the
roe-buck; was glowing as the summer-fruits; active in
sports, strong to labor; he has passed in one moment from
youth to age; his comeliness is departed; helplessness is
-his portion, for the days of future years. He is more decrepit than his grandsire, on whose head are the snows of
eighty winters; but these were the snows of nature; this is
the desolation of man.

Some turned their heads away to hlide the tears that
needed not to be hidden,-and when the brothers had released each other from a long and sobbing embrace, many
went up to them, and, in a sin,g!le word or twvo, expressed
their joy at this perfect reconcilement.  The brothers themselves walked away from the church-yard, arm in arm with
the minister to the manse.  On the following Sabbath, they
were seen sitting wvith their families in the same pew, and
it was observed that they read together off the same Bible
when the minister gave out the text, and that they sang
together, talking hold of the same psailm-book.  The same
psalm was sung, (given out at their own request,) of which
one verse had been repea.ted at their father's grave; a
larger sum  than usual was on that Sabbath found in the
plate for the poor. for Love and Charity are sisters.  And
ever z.fter, both duringr the peace and the troubles of this
life, the hearts of the brothers were as one, and in nothing
were they divided.

Like a struggling dream at break of day.
No image meets my wandering eye,
But the new-risen sun and the sunny sky.
Though the night-shades are gone, yet a vapor dull
Bedims the waves so beautiful;
While a low and melancholy moan
Mourns for the glory chat hath flowin.
LESSON CXXIII.
Dr. Slop and Obadiah, meeting.-STERNE.
IMAGINE to yourself, a little squat, uncourtly figure of a
Dr. Slop, of about four feet and a half, perpendicular height,
with a breadth of back, and a sesquipedality of belly, which
might have done honor to a sergeant' in the horse-guards.
Such were the outlines of Dr. Slop's figure, which-if you
have read Hogarth's analysis of beauty, (and if you have
not, I wish-you would;)--you must know, may as certainly
be caricatured, and conveyed to the mind by three strokes as
three hundred.
Imagine such a one,-for such, I say, were the outlines
of Dr. Slop's figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot,
waddling through the dirr. upon the vertebrae of a little
diminutive pony, of a pretty color.- but of strengthalack! scarce able to have made an amble of it, under such
a fardel, had the roads been in an ambling condition.-They
were not.-Irnagine to yourself, Obadiah mounted upon a

TIIE AMERICANstrong monster of a coach-horse, pricked into a full gallop,
and making all practicable speed the ad verse way.
Pray, Sir, let me interest you a momert in this description.
Had Dr. Slop beheld Obatdiah a mile off, posting in a
narrow lane directly towards him, at that monstrous rate,splashing and plunging like a devil through thick and thin
as he approached, would not such a phenomenon, with such
a vortex of mud and water moving along with it, rolund its
axis,--have been a subject of juster apprehension ta Dr.
Slop in his situation, than the worst of Whiston's colnets?
-To  say nothing of the nucleus; that is, of CObadialh and
the coach-horse.-In my idea, the vortex alone of them
was enough to have involved and carried, if not the doctor,
at least the doctor's pony, quite away with it.
What then do you think must the terror and hydrophobia of Dr. Slop have been, when you read (whi-h you are
just going to do) that he was advancing thus warily along
towards Shandy HIall, and had approached within sixty
yards of it, and within five yards of a sudden turn, made by
an acute angle of the garden wall,-and in the dirtiest part
of a dirty lane,-when Obadiah and his coach-horse turned
the corner, rapid, furious,-pop,-full upon him!-Nothing,
I think, in nature can be supposed more terrible than such a
rencounter,-so imprompt! so ill prepared to stand the shock
of it as Dr. Slop was!
What could Dr. Slop do?   he crossed himself-  Pugh!
--but the doctor, Sir, was a Papist.-No matter; he had
better have kept hold of the pomrnel.--He had so; nay, as
it happened, he had better have done nothing at all; for in
crossing himself he let go his whip,-and in attemlpting
to save his whip between his knee and his saddle's skirt, as
it slipped, he lost his stirrup,-in losing which he lost his
seat; and in the multitude of all these losses (which, by the
by, shew what little advantage there is in crossing) the
unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mnind.  So that without waiting for Obadiah's onset, he left his pony to its
destiny, tumbling off it diagonally, something in the style
and manner of a pack of wool, and without any other consequence from the fall, save that of being left (as it would
have been) with the broadest part of him sunk about twelve
inches deep in the mire.
Obadiah pulled off his cap tws.ice to Dr. Slop;--once as he
was falling, and then again when lie saw him seated.-Illtimed complaisance! had not the fellow better have stopped

FIRST CLASS BOOK.his horse, and go o1, and helped him?  Sir, he did all thac
his situation would allow;-but the momenteum of the coachhorse was so great, that Oadiah could not do it all at once,
he rode in a circle three tinmes round Dr. Slop, before he
could fully accomplish it any how; and at last, when he did
stop the beast, it was done with such an explosion of mud,
that Obadiah had better have been a league off. In short,
never was a Dr. Sbop so beluted, and so transubstantiated,
since that affair camne iinto fashion.

leroic Self-Denial.-ILITERARy GAZETTE.
DARK burned the candle on the table at which the student.
of divinity was reading in a large book: " It all avail aothing, and nothing will ever come of it," said he fre,ally to
himself, and closed the volume, "I shall never become a
preacher, I may study and tire myself as much as I will!
The first sermon, in which I shall certainly hesitate, will
without doubt render all this trouble vain; for do not I
myself know the timidity and the peculiar misfortune which
accompany me in every undertaking?"
He now took from his dusty shelves a AIS. and set himself down to read: it was an account of Rome, and particularly of St. Peter's Churchs which was described with all
the enthusiasm of an artist.  He suddenly rose, and clapping
his hands together, said with transport, " 0 heaven, I must
certainly see all this myself!"
But how? oine does not get to Rome for nothing; the
finan'ces of the good student were in a very bad condition,
and however carefully he examined and fumbled througl
all his pockets, he collected only a few pence, which certainly were not sufficient to pay his expenses to Rome. He
went to bed quite restless, and even forgot to put out his
candle, which at other times he never omitted; but during
this uneasy night, he thought of means to accomplish his
purpose.  The next morning he fetched an old clothes man,
iand sold every thing except the dress he had on, and a single
shirt for change which he put in his pocket.
The sum, which he got from the greedy Israelite for all
272
[Lessonz 124.
TIIE AMERICANhe had, was not much, and yet honesty, a virtue which he
possessed in t-he highest degree, demanded of himn to pay
his few small debts.  After he had performed this duty in
the most conscientious manner, he counted up his renmaining
property, and was pleased onl finding himself the possessor
of five dollars, because he hoped wvith this suml, and  i.th
strict frugality, to travel to Romle and back again.
He now, therefore, began his ijourney in the highest spirits,
and wandered over fertile Germany with heartfelt joy, at
the beauties of nature in his beloved country.  How  did
Italy's mild and balsami'ic airs refresh him! how did he
indulge all his senses in the conltemplation of the delightful
scenes that crowded on him  from every side! and howv did
his heart thrill with bliss when he beheld the towers of Rome
shiining in the misty distance! Longr did he stand gazing and
enraptured, and a tear of joy stood in his eyes; lie walked
on, lost in thought, and toNwards evenincg he reached a hill
at the foot of which the Queen of Cities, illumined with
gold and purple, by the blush of the evening sky, lay in
the most glorious splendor. He "seated himself upon the
summit of the hill, and turned his eyes constantly, with the
nmost heartfelt longing, towards the object of his secret
wishes.
After his soul had satiated itself with this delightful picture, he at length thought of examining his stock of money,
that he might see hoAw much he could spare in Rome in
examining the captivating wonders, without depriving himself of the necessary means for his journey baclk. When
he had counted it, he found that he had just spent the half
of it, viz. two dollars and a half.  Of course he had been
frequently obliged, in the pursuit of Ihis journey, to beg a
night's lodging and dinner from  the clergymen on the road,
to be able to reach so far upon so trifling a sum, but never
did he receive money or ask almns. If, then, he would return to his native country without begging, he must not
see Romne, and he had, in fact,.the heroic  self-denial to
form  this resolution on the spot.  HIe, therefore, remained
for that night on this hill, saw the moon and stars rise over
the much-beloved Rorne; he listened with silent deligllt to
the chmne of the church bells in the stillness of the evening, and when ttie morning sun, rising in the east, tinged
the domes and towers of the city withl red, he "cast one
longing, lingering look behind." and began in silent musing
his journey horrme

He returned home with his longing, gratified, and employed his last penny in pra-ing the boatmnan who ferried him
over to his native isl~ind.  Hle renounced the study of divinity, which he hated, and entered into the service of a
peasant, with whom he continued for a whole year, at the
end of which he employed his wag'es which he had saved.

travelling, he set out upon a pilgrimage.
LESSON CXXV.
0Oz the waste of lfe.-FRANKLIN.
ABIERGUS was a gentleman of good estate; he was bred to
no business, and could not contrive howv to waste his hours
agreeably; he had no relish for any of the proper works of
life, nor any taste for the improvement of the mind; he
spent generally ten hours of the four-and-twenty in bed; he
dozed away two or three more on his cotuch; and as many
were dissolved in good liquor every evening, if he met with
comnpany of his own hunor.--Thus he mrade a shift to
wear off ten years of his life since the paternal estate fell
into his hands.
One evening as he was musin( alone, his thoughts happened to take a most unusual turn. for they cast a glance
backward, and he begana to reflect on his manner of life.
He bethought hiinself wlhat a nurnber of living' beings had
been made a s'icrifice to support his carcass, and how much
corn and wvine had been mningled with these offerings; and
he set himself to compute what he had devoured since he
came to the age of man.  "About a dozenl feathered creatures, small and great, hale, o-ne week with another," said
he, " given up their lives to prolong mine, whlich, in ten
years, amounts to at least six thousand.  Fifty sheep have
been sacrificed in a year, with lhalf a hecatomb of blacl
cattle, that I might have the choicest parts offered weekly
upon my table.
"Thus a thousand beasts, out of the flock and the herd, have
been slain in ten years' time to feed me, besides what the
forest has supplied me with. MIany hundreds of fishes have,
274
THE AMEER,ICAN
[Lesson 125.in all their variety, been robbed of life for mly repast, anc
of the smaller fry some thousands. A measure of corn
would hardly suffice me fine flour enough for a month's provision, and this arises to above six score bushels; and many
hoghleads ef winle and other liquors have passed through
this body of mine-this wretched strainer of meat and
drink!  And -what have I done all this time for God anA
man?  W'hat a vast profusion of good things upon a useless
life, and a worthless liver?
" There is not the meanest creature among all those which
I have devoured, but hath answered the end of its creation
Ibett  than I.  It was made to support human nature, and
it_[ done so. Every crab and oyster I have eat, and
eve  grain of corn I have devoured, hath filled up its place
in the rank of beings with more propriety and honor than
I have done.  Oh, shameful waste of life and time!"
In short, he carcied on his moral reflections with so just
and severe a force'of reason, as constrained him to change
his whole course of life; to break off his follies at once, and
to apply himself to gain some useful knowledtge, when he
was more than thirty years of age.  He lived many following years with tlle character of a wbrthy man and an excellent Christian; he died with a peaceful conscience, and the
tears of his country were dropped upon his tomb.
The world, that knew the whole series of his life, were:amazed at the mighty change. They beheld him as a wonder of reformation, while he himself confessed and adored
the Divine power and mercy which had transformed him
from a brute to a man.  But this was a single instance, and
we may almost veiture to write miracle upon it.  Are there
not numbers, in this degenerate age, whose lives thus run to
utter waste, without the least tendency to usefulness?

LESSON VI.
Parallel between Pope and Dryden.-JoHNsoN.
Por,E professed to have learned his poetry from Dryden,
whom, whenever an opportunity was presented, he praised
through his whole life with unvaried liberality; and perhaps
his character may receive some illustration, if he be comhtared with his master.
Integrity of understanding, and nicety of discernment,
were not allotted in a less proportion to Dryden than to Pope.
The rectitude of Dryden's mind was sufficiently shown by
the dismission of his poetical prejudices, and the rejection of
unnatural thoughts and rugged numbers. But Dryden never desired to apply all the judgment that he had. He wrote,
and professed to write, merely for the people; and when he
plased others, he contented himself. He spent.,no time in
struggles to rouse latent powers; he never attempted to
make that better which was already good, nor often to mend
what he must have known to be faulty. He wrote, as he
tells us, with very little consideration: when occasion or
necessity called upon him, he poured out what the present
moment happened to supply, and, when once it had passed
the press, ejected it from his mind; for, when he had no pecuniary interest he had no further solicitude.
Pope was not content to satisfy; he desired to excel, and
therefore always endeavored to do his best; he did not
court the candor, but dared the judgment of his reader,.
and, expecting no indulgence from  others, he shewed none
to hinmself. He examined lines and words with minute and
punctilious observation, and retouched every part with indefatigable diligence, till he had left nothing to be forgiven.
For this reason he kept his pieces very long in his hands,
while he considered and reconsidered them. The only
poems which can be supposed to have been written with

Fingal's Battle with the Spirit of Loda.-OssIAN.
MIONING rose in the east; the blue waters rolled in light.
Finga?* bade his sails to rise, and the winds- came rustling
* "It may not be improper here to observe, that the accent ought
always to he placed on the last syllable of Fingrtl."-klcPherson's wiote
to l'ingal, B. 1.from  their hills.  Inistore rose to sight, and Carric-thura's
mossy towvers.  But the sign of distress was on their top:
the green flame edged with smoke.  The king of Morven
struck his breast: he. assumed at once his spear.   His
darkened brow bends forward to the coast: he looks baclc
to the lagging wiynds.  His hair is disordered on his back.
The silence of the king( is terrible.
Night camle down on the sea: Rotha's bay received the
ship.  A rock bends alojng the coast with all its echoingr
wvood.  On the top is the circle of Loda, and the mossy
stone of power.  A narrow plain spreads beneath, covered
with grass and aged trees, which the midnight winds, in
their wrath, had torn from  the shaggy rock.  The blue
course of a stream  is there: and the lonely blast of ocean
pursues the thistle's beard.  The flame of three oals arose:
the feast is spread around: but the soul of the king is sad
ftr Carric-thura's battling chief.
The wan cold moon rose in the east.   Sleep descended
cn the youths.   Their blue helmets glitter to the beam: the
fading fire decays.  But sleep did not rest on the king: he
rose in the midst of his arms, and slowly ascended the hill
to behold the flame of Sarno's tower.
The flame was dim  and distant; the moon hid her red
face in the east.  A blast came from  the mountain, and
bore on its wing the spirit of Loda.  He came to his place
in his terrors, and he shook his dusky spear. His eyes
appear like flames in his dark face; and his voice is like
distant thunder.   Fingal advanced with the spear of his
strength, and raised his voice on high.
" Son of night, retire: call thy winds and fly: Why dost
thou come to my presence with thy shadowy arms?  Do I
fear thy gloomy form, dismal spirit of Loda?  Weak is thy
shield of clouds: feeble is that meteor, thy sword.  The
blast rolls them together, and thou thyself dost vanish. Fly
from my presence, son of night! call thy wings and fly "
"Dost thou force me from  my place," replied the hollowv
voice: "The people bend before me.  I turn the battle in
the field of the valiant.  I look on the nations and they
vanish: my nostri's pour the blast of death.  I come abroad
on the winds: the tempests are before my face.  But my
dwelling is calm, above the clouds; the fields of mny rest
are pleasant."
" "Dwell -tlien in thy calm  field," said Fingal, "and let
Comhal's son be forgot.  Do my steps ascend, from my hills,
280
[Lesson 128.into thy peaceful plains? Do I meet thee, with a spear, on
thy cloud, spirit of disrmal Loda?  Why, then, dost thou
frown on Fingal?. Or shake thine airy spear?  But thou
frownest in vain: I never fled from mighty men.  And shall
the sons of the wind frighten the king of Morvven! No: he
knows the weakness of their arms."
" Fly to thy land," replied the formn: "receive the wind
and fly. The blasts are in the hollow of my hand: the
course of the storm is mine.  The ling of Sora is mny son,
lie bends at the stone of my power.  His battle is around
Carric-thura; and he will prevail.  Fly to thy land, son of
Comhal, or feel my flaming wvratli."
He lifted high his shadowy spear; and bent forward his
terrible height.  But the king, advancing, drew his sword;
the blade of dark-browvn Luno.  The gleaming path of the
steel winds through the gloomny gthost.  The  form  fell
shapeless into air, like a c.lumnr of tmoke, which the staff
of the boy disturbs, as x. "e9es from  the half-extinguished
furnace.
The spirit of Loda shrieked, as, rolled into himself, he
rose on the wild. Inistore shook at the sound.  The waves
heard it on the deep: they stopped, in their course, with
fear: the companions of Fingal started, at once; and took
their heavy spears.  They missed the king; they rose with
rage: all their arms resound.
The moon came forth in the east.  The king returned in
the gleam of his arms. The joy of his youths was great;
their souls settled, as a sea from a storm.  Ullin raised the
song of gladness.  The hills of Inistore rejoiced.  The
flame of the oak arose; and the tales of heroes are told.

Death of Carthon.-Ossian's address to thie Sun?.--THE SAMIIE.
THE battle ceased along the field, for the bard had sung
the song of peace. The chiefs gathered round the falling
Carthon, and heard his words, with sighs.  Silent they
leaned on their spears, while Ba!c!utha's hero spoke. His
hair sighed in the wind, and his words were feeble.
" King of Morven," Cartlion said, " I fall in the midst
of my course. A foreign tomb receives, in youth, the last

Perfiaps the husband of Moina will mourn over his fallen
Carthon."  His words reached the heart of Clessammor:
he fell, in silence, on hIis son.  The host stood darkened
around: no voice is on the plains of Lora.  Night came,
and the,goon, from  the east, looked on the mournful field:
but still they stood, like a silent grove that lifts its head on
Gormal, when the loud winds are laid, and dark autumn is
on the plain.
Three days they mourned over Carthon: on the fourth
his father died. In the narrow plain of the rock they lie;
and a dim ghost defends their tomb.  There lovely Moina
is often seen; when the sun-beam darts on the rock, and all
around is dark.  There she is seen, Malvina, but not like
the daughters of the hill. Her robes are from the stranger's land; and she is still alone.
Fingal was sad for Carthon; he desired his bards to mark
the day, when shadowy autufmn returned. And often did
they mark the day, and sing the hero's praise.  "C Who
comes so dark from ocean's roar, like autumn's shadowy
cloud? Death is trembling in his hand! his eyes are flames
of fire! Who roars along dark Lora's heath? Who but
Carthon king of swords? The people fall! see! how  he
strides, like the sullen ghost of Morven! But there he lies,
a goodly oak, w.hich sudden blasts overturned! When shalt
thou rise, Balclutha's joy! lovely car-borne Carthon? Who
comes so dark from ocean's roar, like autumn's shadowy
cloud?" Such were the words of the bards, in the day of
their mourning: I have accompanied their voice; and added
to their song. My soul has been mournftil for Carthon, he
fell in the days of his valor: and thou, 0 Cless'mmor!
where is thy dwelling in the air?  Has the youth forgot his
wound? And flies he, on the clouds, with thee?  I feel the
sun, O Malvina; leave me to my rest.  Perhaps they may
come to my dreams; I think I hear a feeble voice. The
beam of heaven delights to shine on the grave of Carthotl:
I feel it warm around.
0 thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers!  Whence are thy beams, 0 sun! thy everlasting

storm.  But to Ossian, thou lool;est in vain; for he bellolds
thy beams no more; wvhether thy yellow hair flows on the
eastern clouds, or thou trernblest at the gates of the west.
But thou art perhaps, like me, for a season, and thy years
will have an end. Thou shalt sleep in thy clouds, careless
of the voice of the morning.  Exult then, 0 sun, in the

his journey.

CENTRE of light and energy! thy way
Is through the unknown void; thou hast thy throne,
MIorning, and evening, and at noon of day;
Far in the blue, untended and alone:
Ere the first-wakened airs of earth had blown,
Oni didst thou march, triumphant in thy light;
Then didst thou send thy glance, which still hath flow-n
Wide through the never-ending worlds of night,
And yet thy full orb burns with flash unquenched and bright
Thy path is high in heaven;-we cannot gaze
On the intense of light that girds thy car;
There is a crown of glory in thy rays,
W'hich bears thy pure divinity afar
To mingle with the equal light of star;
For thou, so vast to us, art, in the whole,
One of the sparks of night, that fire the air;
And, as around thy centre planets roll,
So thou, too, hast thy patlh around the Central Soul.

When through their heaven thy chanoging car is borne;
Thou wheel'st away thy flight,-the woeds are shorn
Of all their waving locks, and storms awake;
All, that was once so beautiful, is torn

And in their maddening rush the crested mountains shake.

Of their chilled frames, and then they proudly spurn
All bands that would confine, and give to air

such regard to the times as might hasten their publication,
were the two satlres of Thirty-eight: of which Dodsley told
me, that they were brought to him by the author, that they
might be fairly copied.  " Every line," said he, " was then
written twice over; I gave him a clean transcript, which he
sent some time afterwards to me for the press, with every line
written twice over a second time."
His declaration, that his care for his works ceased at their
publication, was not strictly true. His parental attention
never abandoned them: what he found amiss in the first
edition, he silently corrected in those that followed. He
appears to have revised the iliad, and freed it from some of
its imperfections; and the Essay on Criticism received many
improvements after its first appearance. It wiill seldom be
found that he altered without adding clearness, elegance, or
vigor. Pope had perhaps the judgment of Dryden; but
Dryden certainly wanted the diligence of Pope.
In acquired knowledge, the superiority must be allowed
to Dryden, whose education was more scholastic, and who,
before he became an author, had been allowed more time
for study, with better means of information. His mind has
a larger range, and he collects his images and illustrations
from a more extensive circumference of science. Dryden
knew more of man in his general nature, and Pope in his
local manners. The notions of Dryden were formed by
comprehensive speculation, and those of Pope by minute
attention.  There is more dignity in the  knowledge of
Dryden, and more certainty in that of Pope.
Poetry was not the sole praise of either; for both excelled lilkewise in prose; but Pope did not borrow his prose
from his predecessor. The style of Dryden is capricious
and varied; that of Pope is cautious and uniform.  Dryden
obeys the motions of his own mind; Pope constrains his
mind to his own rules of composition.  Dryden is sometimes
v(ihement and rapid; Pope is always smooth, uniform, and
gentle. Dr-den's page is a natural field, rising into inequalities, and diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation; Pope's is a velvet lawn, shaven by the sithe
and levelled by the roller.
Of genius, that power which  constitutes a poet; that
quality without which judgment is cold, and knowledge is
inert; that energy which collects, combines, amplifies, ard
animates; the superiority must, with some hesitation, be
allowed to Dryden. It is not to be inferred, that of this

LESSON  CXXXII.
On the use and abuse of amusements.-ALIsoN.
IT were unJust and ungratefiul to conceive that the amusements of life are altogether forbid by its beneficent Author
They serve, on the contrary, important purposes in the
economy of human life, and are destined to produce important effects, both upon our happiness and character.  They
are, in the first place, in the language of the Psalmist, " the
wells of the desert;" the kind resting-places in which toil
may relax, in which the weary spirit may recover its tone,
and where the desponding mind may resume its strength
and its hopes.
They are, in another view, of some importance to the dignity of individual character.  In every thing we call amusemellt, there is generally some display of taste and imagination,-some elevation of the mind from mere animal
indulgence, or the baseness of sensual desire.  Even in the
scenes of relaxation, therefore, they have a tendency to
preserve the dignity of human character, and to fill up the
vacant and unguarded hours of life with occupations innocent, at least, if not virtuous. But their principal effect,
Lesson 132.]
287perhaps, is upon the social character of man.  Whatever
amusement is sought, it is in the. society of our brethren;
and whenever it is found, it is in our sympathy with the
happiness of those ariound us. It bespeaks the disposition
of benevolence, and it creates it.
When men assemble, accordingly, for the purpose of gene.
ral happiness or joy, they exhibit to the thoughtful eye,
one of the most pleasing appearances of their original characters.  They leave behlind them, for a time, the faults of
their station and the asperities of their temper;-they forget the secret views, and selfish purposes of their ordinary
life, and mingle with the crowd around them with no other
view than to receive and to communicate happiness.  It is a
spectacle which it is impossible to observe without emotion;
and, while the virtuous man rejoices at the evidence which
it affords of the benevolent constitution of his nature, the
pious man is apt to bless the benevolence of that God, who
thus makes the wilderness and the solitary place be glad,
and wvhose wisdom renders even the hours of amusement
slubservient to the cause of virtue.
It is not, therefore, the use of the innocent amuisements
of life which is dangerous, but the abuse of them;--it is not
when they are occasionally, but when they are constantly
pursued; when the love of amusement degenerates into a
passion, and when, from being an occasional indulgence, it
becomes an habitual desire.  What the consequences of this
inordinate love of amusement are, I shall now  endeavor
very briefly to show you.
When we look, in a moral view, to the consequences of
human pursuits, rwe are not to stop at the precise and immediate effects which they may seem to have upon character.
It is chiefly by the general frame of mind they produce, and
the habitual dispositions they create, that we are to determine whether their influence is fortunate or unfortunate on
those who are englaged in them.  In every pursuit, whatever
gives strength and enerrgy to the mind of man, experience
teaches to be favorable to the interests of piety, of knowledge, and of virtue;--in every pursuit, on the contrary,
whatever enfeebles or limits the powers of mind, the same
experience every where shows to be hostile to the best
interests of human nature.
If it is in this view we consider the effects of the habitual
love even of the most innocent amusement, we shall find
that it produces necessarily, for the hour in which it is in21qss
TIIE AMERICAN
ILesson 132dulged, an enfeebled and dependent frame of mind; that in
such scenes energy resolves, and resolution fades;-that in
the enjoyment of the present lhour, the past and the future
are alike forgrotten; and that the heart learns to be satisfied
with passive emotion, and momentary pleasure.
It is to this single observation, my young   friends, that I
wish at present to direct your attention; and to entreat you.o consider what may be expected to be the effects of such
a character of mind, at your age, upon the honor and happiness of future life.
1. It tends to degrade all the powers of the understanding. It is the eternal law of nature, that truth and wisdom
are the offspring of labor, of vigor, and perseverance in
every worthy object of pursuit.  The eminent stations of
fame, accordingly, and the distinguished honors of knowledge, have, in every age, been the reward only of such early
attainments, of that cherished elevation of mind which pursues only magnificent ends, and of that heroic fortitude
which, whether in action or in speculation, pursues them by
the means of undeviating exertion.
For the production of such a character, no discipline can
be so unfit as that of the habitual love of amusement. It
klindles not the eye of ambition;-it bids the heart beat with
no throb of generous admiration;-it lets the soul be calm,
while all the re-st of our fellows are passing us in the road of
virtue or of science.  Satisfied with humble and momentary
enjoyment, it aspires to no honor, no praise, no pre-eminence, and, contented with the idle gratification of the present hour, forgets alike what man has done, and what man
was born to do.
If such be the character of the youthful mind, if it be
with such aims and such ambition that its natural elevation
can be satisfied, am I to ask vou, what must be the appearances of riper years?-what the effect of such habits
of thought upon the understanding of manhood?  Alas! a
greater instructer, the mighty instructer, experience, may
show you in every rank of life what these effects are.-It
will show you men born with every capacity, and whose
first years glowed with every honorable ambition, whom
no vice even now degrades, and to whom no actual guilt is
affixed, who yet live in the eye of the world only as the
objects of pity or of scorn,-who, in the idle career of habitual amusement, have dissipated all their powers, and lost
all their ambition,-and who exist now for no purpose, but
25
289
Lesson 132.1
FIRST CLASS BOOK.to be the sad memorials of i(rnoble taste anld degraded understanding.
2. The inordinate love of pleasure is, in the seconid place
equally hostile to tlie moral character.  If the feeble and
passive disposition of mind which it produces be unfavorable to the exertions of the understanding, it is, in the same
measure as unfavorable to the best employments of the
heart.  The great duties of life, the duties for which every
man and wonman is born, demand, in all situations, the mind
of labor and perseverance.  Frem  the first hour of existence to the last,-from the cradle of the infant, beside
which the mother watches wi:'h unslumbering eye, to the
grave of the aged, where the son pours his last tears upon
the bier of his fathler,-in all that intermediate time, every
day calls for exertion and activity, and the moral honors
of our being call only be won by the steadfast magnanimity
of pious duty.
If such be the laborious but animiating destiny of man, is
it in the enervating school of habitual amusement, that the
young are to fit themselves for its high discharge? Is it from
hence that the legislator is to learn those lengthened toils
which decide the happiness of nations; or the warrior, that
undaunted spirit, which can scorn both danger and death in
the defence of his country? Or is it here, my young friends,
that experience tells you, you can best learrn to perform  the
common duties of your coming days; those sacred duties
of domestic life which every one is called to dischar(e,
firom which neither riches nor poverty are free, and which,
far more than all others, open to you the solemn prospect
of being either t'he blessings or the curses of society.
Alas! experience has here also decided; it tells you, that
the mind which exists only for pleasure, cannot exist for
duty:-it tells you, that the feeble and selfish spirit of
amusement gradually corrodes all the benevolent emotions
of the heart, and withers the most sacred ties of domestic
affection;-and it points its awful finger to the examples of
those, alas! of both sexes, whomi the unrestrained love of
idle pleasure first led to error and folly, and whom, with
sure but fatal progress, it has since conducted to be the objects of secret shame, and public infamy.
3. In the last place, this unmanly disposition is equally
fatal to happiness as to virtue.  To the wise and virtuous,
to those who use the pleasures of life only as a temporary
relaxation, as a-resting-place to animate them on the great

full, while to those who linger by its side, its waters are
soon dried and exhausted.
I speak not now of those bitter waters which must mingle
themselves with the well of unhallowed pleasure,-of the
secret reproaches of accusing conscience,-of the sad sense
of shame and dishonor,--end of that degraded spirit, which
must bend itself beneath the scorn of the world;--I speak
only of the simple and natural effect of unwise indulgence;
-that it renders the mind callous to enjoyment;-and that,
even though the " fountain were full of wrater," the feverish

enjoyment;--the mature hastening, with hopeless step, to
fill up the hours of a vitiated being;--and, wlhat is still more
wretclhed, the hoary head wandering in the way of folly,
and, with an unhallowved dotagre, returning again to the
trifles and the amusements of childhood.
Such then, my younc friends, are the natural and experienced consequences of the inordinate love even of innocent
amusement, and such the intellectual and moral degradation
to which the paths of pleasure conduct. Let me entreat
you to pause, ere you begin your course; ere those habits
are acquired which may never again be subdued;--and ere
ye permit the charms of pleasure to wind around your soul
their fascinating powers.
Thinkl, with the elevation and grenerosity of your age,
whether this is the course that leads to honor or to fame;whether it was in this discipline that they were exercised,
who, in every age, have blessed, or have enlightened the
world,--whose shades are present to your midnight thoughts,
-and whose names you cannot pronounce without the tear
of gratitude or admiration.
Think, still more, whether it was to the ends of unmanly
pleasure that you were dedicated, wrhen the solemn service of
religion first enrolled you in the number of the faithful, and
when the ardent tears of your parents mingled with the waters
of your baptism. If they live, is it in such paths that their anxious eyes delight to see you tread?-If they are no more, is
it onsuch scenes that they can bend their venerated heads
from Heaven, and rejoice in the course of their children?LESSON CXXXII1.
The needless alarm:-A Tale. -CowPER.
THERE is a field through which I often pass,
Thick overspread with moss and silky grass,
Adjoining close to Kilwick's echoing wood,
Where oft the she-fox hides her hapless brood,
Reserved to solace many a neighboring squire,
That he may follow them through brake and brier,
Contusion hazarding of neck, or spine,
Which rural gentlemen call sport divine.
A narrow brook, by rushy banks concealed,
Runs in a bottom, and divides the field;
Oaks intersperse it, that had once a head,
But now wear crests of oven-wood instead;
And where the land slopes to its watery bourn,
Wide yawns a gulf, beside a shaggy thorn;
Bricks line the sides, but shivered long ago,
And horrid brambles intertwine below:A hollow, scooped, I judge, in ancient time,
For baking earth, or burning rock to lime.
Not yet the hawthorn bore her berries red,
With which the fieldfare, wintry guest, is fed
Nor Autumn yet had brushed from every spray,
With her chill hand, the mellow leaves away;
But corn was housed, and beans were in the stack:
Now, therefore, issued forth the spotted pack,
With tails high mounted, ears hung low, and throats
With a whole gamut filled of heavenly notes,
For which, alas! my destiny severe,
Though ears she gave me two, gave me no ear.
The sun, accomplishing his early march,
His lamp now planted on heaven's topmost arch,
When, exercise and air my only aim,
And heedless whither, to that field I came,
Ere yet, with ruthless joy, the happy hound
Told hill and dale that Reynard's track was found,
Or with the high-raised horn's melodious clang
All Kilwickx and all Dinglederry* rang.
Sheep grazed the field: some with soft bosom pressed
The herb, as soft, while nibbling strayed the rest:
Nor noise was heard, save of the hasty brook,

With all these hideous howlings to the skies,

For such a cause, to feel the slightest fear.
Yourselves have seen what time the thunders relled

But more discreet than he, a Cambrian ewe.
"How! leap into the pit, our life to save?
To save our life leap all into the grave?

The depth, how awful! falling there we burst:
Or, should the brambles, interposed, our fall

For, with a race like theirs, no chance I see
Of peace or ease to creatures clad as we.
Meantime, noise kills not.  Be it Dapple's bray,
Or be it not, or be it whose it may,
And rush those other sounds, that seem by tongues
Of demons uttered, from whatever lungs,
Sounds are but sounds; and, till the cause appear,
We have at least commodious standing here.
Come fiend, come fury, giant, monster, blast
From earth, or hell, we can but plunge at last."

Forest Trees.-WV. IRVING.
I IIAVE paused more than once in the wilderness of America, to conternm'plate the traces of some blast of wind, which
seemed to lhave rushed down from the clouds, and ripped
its way through the bosom of the woodlands; rootingr up,
shivering, and splintering the stoutest trees, and leaving a
long track of desolation.
There is somethingl  awful in the vast havoc made among
these gigantic plants; and in considerin, their magnificent
remains, so rudely torn and mangled, hurled down to perish
prematurely on their native soil, I was conscious of a strong
movement of sympathy with the wood-nymphs, grieving to
be dispossessed of their aincient habitations.  I recollect also
hearin(g a traveller of poetical temperament, expressing the
kind of horror which he felt in beholding, on the banks of
the Missouri, an oalc of prodigious size, which had been
in a manner overpowered by an enormous wild grape-vine.
The vine hnd clasped its huge folds round the trunk, and
from thence had wound about every branch and! twig, until
the mighty tree had withered in its emnbrace.  It seemed
like Lao'con struggf,ling inefTectually in the hideous coils of
the monster Python.  It was the lion of trees perishing in
the embraces of a vegetable Boa.

more; for every other writer since Mlilton must give place
to Pope; and even of Dryden it must be said that if he has
brighter paragraphs, he has not better poems. Dryden's
performances were always hasty, either excited by some
external occasion or extorted by domestic necessity; he
composed without consideration, and published without correction. What his mind could supply at call, or gather in
one excursion, was all that he sought, and all that he gave.
The dilatory caution of Pope enabled him to condense his
sentiments, to multiply his images, and to accumulate all
that study might produce, or chance might supply. If the
flights of Dryden, therefore, are higher, Pope continues longer on the wing. If of Dryden's fire the blaze is brighter, of
Pope's the heat is more regular and constant. Dryden often surpasses expectation, and Pope never falls below  it.
Dryden is read with frequent astonishment, and Pope with
perpetual delight.
This parallel will, I hope, when it is well considered, be
found just; and if the reader should suspect me, as I suspect
myself, of some partial fondness for the memory of Dryden,

he had gone considerabl-e distances to exaTnine trees which
were celebrated among rural amateurs'; for it seems that
trees, like horses, have their established points of excellence,
and that there are some in England which enjoy very
extensive celebrity from bein(g perfect in their kind.
There is somethiljg nobly simple and pure in such a taste.
It argues, I think, a sweet and generous nature, to have
this strong relish for the beauties of vegetation, and this
friendship for the hardy and glorious sons of the forest.
There is a grandeur of thought conniected with this part of
riral economy.  It is, if I may be allowed the figure, the
heroic line of husbandry. It is worthy of liberal, ands freeborn, and aspiring men.  He who plants an oak looks- forward to future ages, and plants for posterity.  Nothing can
be less selfish than this.  He cannot expect to sit in its
shade nor enjoy its shelter; but he exults in the idea that
the acorn which he has buried in the earth shall grow up
into a lofty pile, and shall keep on flourishing, and increasing,
and benefiting mankind, long after he shall have ceased to
tread his paternal fields.
Indeed, it is the nature of such occupations to.ift the
thought above mere worldliness. As the leaves of trees are
said to absorb all noxious qualities of the air, and breathe
forth a purer atmosphere, so it seems to me as if they. drew
from us all sordid and angry passions, and. breathed forth
peace and  philanthropy.  There is a serene and settled
majesty in woodland scenery that enters into the soul, and
dilates and elevates it, and fills it with noble inclinations. The
ancient and hereditary groves, too, that embower this island,*
are nlost of them full of story. They are haunted by the recollections of the great spirits of past ages, who have sought
for relaxation among them, from' the tumult of arms, or the
toils of state, or have wooed the muse beneath their shade.
It is becoming, then, for the iligh and generous spirits of
an ancient nation to cherish these sacred groves that sur
round their ancestral mansions, and to perpetuate them to
their descendants.  Brought up, as I have been, in republican habits and principles, I can feel nothing of the servile
reverence for titled rank, merely because it is titled.  But

and feel how  hereditary distinction, when it falls to the lot
of a generous mind, may elevate that mind into true nobility.
It is o-ne of the efiects of hereditary rank, whoen it fails thus
happily, that it multiplies the duties, andl, as it wer, extends the existence of the possessor.  fie does not f -cl
himself ea mere individual link in creation, responsible only
for his own brief term of being.   He carries backl his existence in proud recollection, and he extends it forwvard in
honorable anticipation.   Ile lives with his ancestry, and
he lives with his posterity.  To both does he consider himself involved in deep responsibilities. As he has received
much from those that have gone before, so he feels bound
to transmit much to those who are to come after hinm.
His, domestic undertakings seem to imply a longer existenct than those of ordinary men.  None are so apt to build
and: plant for future centuries, as noble spirited mllen who
have received their heritages front foregoing ages.
I can easily imagine, therefore, the fondness and pride
with which I have noticed English gentlemen, of generous
temperaments, but high aristocratic feelings, contem'plating
those magnificent trees, which rise like towers and pyranmids from the midst of their ipaternal lands.  There is an
affinity between all natures,7nimate and inanimate.  The
oak, in the pride and lustihood of its growth, seems to me to
take its range with the lion and the eagle, and to assimilate,
in the grandeur of its attributes, to heroic and intellectual
man.
With its mighty pillar rising straight and direct toward
heaven; bearing up its leafy honors from the impurities of
earth, and supporting them  aloft in free air and glorious
sunshine, it is an emblem of what a true nobleman should
be; a refu-ge for the weak,-a shelter for the oppressed,a defence for t'he defenceless; warding off from  them  the
peltings of the storim  or the scorching rays of arb'itrary
power.  He who is tis, is an ornamrent and a blessing to
his native land.  He who is otherwise, abuses his eminent
advantages;-aouses the grandeur and prosperity which he
has drawn from the bosom of his country.  Slhould tempests

Old 3Iortality.-TALES OF MIY LANDLORD.
AMoST readers must have witnessed wit}h delight the joyous
burst which attends the dismissing of a village-school, on a
fine summer evening.  The buoyant spirit of childhood, repressed with so much difficulty during the tedious hours of
discipline, may then explode, as it were, in shout, and song,
and frolic, as the little urchins join in groups on their playground, and arrange their matches of sport for the evening
But there is one individual who partakes of the relief afforded by the moment of dismission, whose feelings are not
so obvious to the eye of the spectator, or so apt to receive
his sympathy.
I mean, the teacher hirnself, who, stunned with the hum,
and suffocated with the closeness of his school-room, has
spent the whole day (hirnself against a host) in controlling
petulance, exciting indifference to action, striving to enlighten stupidity, and laboring to soften obstinacy; and
whose very powers of intellect have been confounded by
hearing( the same dull lesson repeated a hundred times by
rote, and only varied by the )Wious blunders of the reciters.
&gt; Even the flowers of ciassiodenius, with which his solitaryv
fancy is most gratified, have been rendered degraded, in
his imagination, by their connexion with tears, with errors,
and with punishment: so that the Eclogues of Virgril, and
Odes of Horace, are each inseparably allied in association
with the sullen figure and monotonous recitation of some blubbering sclool-boy.  If to these mental distresses are added a
delicate frame of body, and a mind ambitious of some higher
distinction than that of being the tyrant of childhood, the
reader may-have some slight conception of the relief which
a solitary walkl, in the cool of a fine summer evening, affords
to the head which has ached, and the nerves which have
been shattered for so many hours, 1n plying the irksome
task of public instruction.
To me, these evening strolls have been the happiest hours
of an unnhappy life; and if any gentle reader shall hereafter
find'pleasulre in pursuing these luclubrations, I am  not unwilling he should knovw, that the pian of thein has been
usually traced in those moments, when relief from  toil and
clamor, combined with the quiet scenery around me, has
disposed my mind to the task of composi,ion.
298
[Llesson: 8,5.299
MIy chief haunt, in these hours of golden l1isurie, is the
banks of a small stream, whlich, winding' through'a lone
vale of green bracken,' passes in front of the village schoolhouse of Gandercleuch.  For the first quarter of a mile,
perhaps, I may be disturbed from my meditations, in order
to return the scrape, or doffed bonnet, of such stragTglers
ameong my pupils as fish for trout or minnows in the littlz
brook, or seek rushes and wild-flowers by is mnargin.-But,
beyond the space I have mentioned, the juvenile anglers do
not, after sun-set, voluntarily extend their excursions.
The cause is, that farther up the narrow  valley, and in
a recess' which seems scooped out of the side of the steep,
heathy bank, there is a deserted burial-ground, vwhich the
little cowards are fearful of approaching' in the twiligrht.  To
me, however, the place has an iilexpressible charm.  It has
been long the favorite termination of mny walks, and if my
kind pa'tron forgets not his promise, will (and. probably at
no very distant day) be my final resting-place after my
mortal pilg'rimage.
It is a spot which possesses all the solemnity of feeling
attached to a burial-ground, without exciting those of a
more unpleasant descriptio'n.  Having. been very little used,
for many years, tlie few hillocl* which rise above the level
plain are covered with the same short velvet turf.  The
mnonurnents, of which,there are not above seven or eight, are
half sunk in the grounLd, and overgrown with moss.  No
newly erected tomb disturbs the sober serenity of our reflections by reminding us of recent calamity, and no rank
springing grass forces ripon our imagination the recollection,
that it owes its dark luxuriance to the foul and festering
remnants of mortality which ferment beneath.
The daisy which sprinkles the sod, and the hare-bell
which hangs over it, derive their pure nourishment from the
dew of heaven, and their growth impresses us with no degrading or disa'usting. recollections.  Death has, indeed, been
here, and its traces are before tius; but they are softened
and deprived of their horror by our distance from  the period
when they have been first impressed.  Those who sleep
beneath. are only connected with us by the reflection that
they have once been what we now  are, and that, as their
relics are now  identified  with their mother earth, ours
shall, at some future period, undergo the samle transformation.
Yet, although the moss has been collected on the most.Lesson 133.]modern of these humble tombs, during four generations of
mankind, the memory of some of those who sleep beneath
thein is still held in revered remembrance.  It is true, that,
upon the largest, and, to the antiquary, the most interesting monument of the group which bears the effigies* of a
doughty knight in his hood of mail, with his shield hanging
on his breast, the armorial bearings are defaced by time,
and a few worn-out letters may be read at the pleasure of
the decipherer; and it is also true that, of another tomb
richly sculptured with an ornamented cross, mitre, and pastoral
staff, tradition can only aver, that a certain nameless bishop
lies interred there.
But upon other two stones which lie beside, may still be
read in rude prose, and ruder rhyme, the history of those
who sleep beneath them.  They belong, we are assured by
the epitaph, to the class of persecuted Presbyterians who
afforded a melancholy subject for history in the times of
Charles II. and his successors.  In returning from the battle
of Pentland Hills, a party of the insurgents had been
attacked in this glen, by a small detachment of the king's
troops, and three or four either killed in the skirmish, or
shot, after being made prisoners, as rebels taken with a"rms
in their hands.
The peasantry continue to attach to the tombs of those
victims of prel'acy an honor which they do rot attach to
more splendid mausoleums; and when they point them out
to their sons, and narrate the fate of the sufferers, they
usually conclude, by exhorting them to be ready, should
times call for it, to resist to the death in the cause of civil
and religious liberty, like their brave forefathers.
One summer evening, as in a stroll, such as I have described, I approached this deserted mansion of the dead, I
was somewhat surprised to hear sounds distinct from those
which usually sooth its solitude, the gentle chiding, namely,
of the brook, and the sighing of the wind in the boughs of
three gigantic ash-trees, which mark the cemetery.   The
clink of a hammer was, upon this occasion, distinctly heard;
and I entertained some alarmn that a march-dike, long meditated by the two proprietors whose estates were divided by
my favorite brook, was about to be drawn up the glen in
order to substitute its rectilinear deformity for the graceful
winding of the natural boundary.
As I approached, I was agreeably undeceived. An old

man was seated,upon the monument of the slaughtered
Presbyterians, and busily employed in deepening, with his
chisel, the letters of the inscription, which, announcing, in
scriptural language, the promised blessings of futurity to be
the lot of the slain, anathematized the murderers with corresponding violence.
A  blue bonnet of unusual dimensions covered the gray
hairs of the pious workman.  His dress was a large old-fashioned coat, of the coarse cloth called hoddin-gray, usually
worn by the elder peasants, with waistcoat and breeches of
the same; and the whole suit, though still in decent repair,
flad obviously seen a train of long service. Strong clouted
shoes, st-udded with hob-nails, and gramoches, or leggins,
nmade of thick black cloth, completed his equipment.
Beside him fed, among the graves, a pony, the companion
of his journey, whose extreme whiteness as well as its projecting bones and hollow eyes, indicated its antiquity.  It
was harnessed in the most simple manner, with a hair tether,
nalter, and a suink, or cushion of straw, instead of bridle
and saddle.  A  canvass pouch hung around the neck of
the animal, for the purpose, probably, of' containing the rider-'s tools, and any thing else he might have occasion to
carry with him.  Although I had never seen the old man before, yet, from the singularity of his employment, and the
style of his equipage, I had no difficulty in recognizing a
religious itinerant vwhom I had often heard talked of, and who
was known in various parts of Scotland by the title of Old
3lortality.
LESSON CXXXVI.
Th/e same-z concluded.
WIHERE the old man was born, or what Mwas his real name,
I have never been abie to learn; nor are the motives which
made him desert his home, and adopt the erratic mode of
life wshich he pursued, knowvn to me except very generally.
According to the belief of most people, he was a native of
either the counlty of Dum~fries or Galloway, and lineally
descended fromr some  of those champions of the Covenant
whose deeds aind sufferings were his favorite theine.
He is said to have held, at one period of his life, a, small
moorland farm; but, whether from pecuniary losses, or do26mestic misfortune, he had long renounced that and every
other gainful calling. In the language of Scripture, he left
his house, his horne, and his kindred, and wandered about
until the day of his death; a period, it is said, of about
thlirty years.
During this long pilgrima(ge, tle pious enthusiast regulated his circuit so as annually to visit the graves of the unfortunate Covenanters who suffered by the sword or by the
executioner, during the reigns of the two last monarchs of
the Stuart line.  Their tombs are often apart from all human
habitation, in the remrote moors and wilds to which the wanderers had fled for concealment. But, wherever they existed,
Old Mortality was sure to visit them when his annual round
brought them within his reach.
In the most lonely recess'es of the mountains, the moorfowl shooter has been often surprised to find hiln busied in
cleaning the rmoss from the gray stones, renewing with hi4
chisel the half-defaced inscriptions, and repairing the emblems of death with which these simple monuments are
usually adorned.
Motives of the most sincere, though fanciful devotion, induced the old man to dedicate so many years of existence
to perform this tribute to the memory of the deceased warriors of the church.  He considered himself as fulfilling a
sacred duty, while renewving, to the eyes of posterity, the
decaying emblems of the zeal and sufferings of their forefathers, and thereby trimming, as it were, the beacon light
which was to warn future generations to defend their religion even unto blood.
In all his wanderings, the old pilgrim  never seemed to
need, or was known to accept, pecuniary assistance.  It is
true, his wants were very few; for wherever he went he
found ready quarters in the house of some Cameronian of
his own sect, or of some other religious person.  The hospitality which was reverentially paid to him he always acknowledged by repairing the grave stones (if there existed
any) belonging to the family or ancestors of his host. As
the wanderer was usually to be seen bent on this pious task
within the precincts of some country church-yard, or reclined on the solitary tomb-stone among the heath, disturbing the plover and the black-cock with the clink of his chisel
and mallet, with his old white pony grazing by his side, he
acquired, from  his converse among the dead, the popular
appellation of Old Mortality.
[lesson 136,
302
TEHE AMERICANThe character of such a man would have in it little connexion even with innocent gayety. Yet among those of his
own religious persuasion, he is reported to have been cheer
ful. The descendants of persecutors, or those whom he supposed guilty of entertaining similar tenets, and the scoffers
at religion by whom he was sometimes assailed, he usually
termed the generation of vipers. Conversing with others,
he was grave and sententious, not without a cast of severity.
But he is said never to have been observed to give way to
violent passion, excepting upon one occasion, when a mis'chievous truant-boy defaced with a stone the nose of a cherub's face which the old man was engaged in retouching. I
am, in general, a sparer of the rod, notwvithstanding the
maxim of Solomon, for which school-boys have little reason
to thank his memory' but on this occasion I deemed it
proper to show that I did not hate the child.-But I must
yreturn to the circumstances attending my first interview
*'with this interesting enthusiast.
In accosting Old Mortalitv, I did not fail to pay respect
to his years and, his principles, beginning my address by a:espectful apology fGr interrupting his labors. The old man
intermitted the operation of the chisel, took off his spectacles and wiped them, then replacing them on his ne e, acknowledged my courtesy* by a suitable return. Encob aged
by his affabllity, I intruded upon hinm some questions.oincerning the sufferers upon whose monument he was now
employed.
To talk of the exploits of the Covenanters was the delight,
as to repair their monuments was the business, of his life. He
was profuse in the communication of all the minute information which he had collected concerning them, their wars,
and their wanderings.  One would almost have supposed he
must have been their contemporary, and have actually beheld the passages which he related; so much had he identified his feelings and opinions with theirs, and so much had
his narratives the circumstantiality of an eye-witness.***'
Soothing the old man by letting his peculiar opinions pass
without contradiction, and anxious to prolong conversation
with so singular a character, I prevailed upon him to accept
that hospitality which my patron is always willing to extend
tc those who need it. In our x;ay to the schoolmaster's
house we called at the Wallace Inn, where I was pretty
certain I should find my patron about that hour of the
evening.

FIRST CLASS BOOK.After a courteous interchange of civilities, Old Mortality
was prevailed upon to join his host in a single glass of liquor,
and that on condition that he should be permitted to name
the pledge, which he prefaced -w%ith a grace of about five
minutes, and then, with bonnet doffed and eyes uplifted,
drank to the memory of those heroes of the Kirk who had
first uplifted her banner upon the mountains. As no persuasion could prevail on him to extend his conviviality to a
second cup, my patron accompanied him home, and accommodated him with the prophet's chamber, as it is his pleasure
to call the closet which holds a spare bed, and which is frequently a place of retreat for the poor traveller.
The next day I took my leave of Old Mortality, who
seemed affected by the unusual attention with which I had
cultivated his acquaintance, and listened to his conversation.
After he had mounted, not without difficulty, the old white
pony, he took me by the hand, and said, " The blessing of
our Master be with you, young man. My hours are like
the ears of the latter harvest, and your days are yet in the
spring; and yet, you may be gathered into the garner of
mortality before me; for the sickle of death cuts down the
green as oft as the ripe; and there is a color in your
cheek, that, like the bud of the rose, serveth oft to hide the
worm of corruption. Wherefore, labor as one who knoweth
not when his master calleth. And if it be my lot to return to
this village after you are gone home to your own place,*these auld withered hands will frame a stone of memorial,
that your name may not perish from among the people."
I thanked Old Mortality for his kind intentions in my behalf, and heaved a sigh, not, I think, of regret so much as
of resignation, to think of the chance that I might soon require his good offices. But though, in all human probability,
he did not err in supposing that my span of life may be
abridged in youth, he had over-estimated the period of his
own pilgrimage on earth. It is now some years since he
has been missed in all his usual haunts, while moss, lichen,
and deer-hair, are fast covering th-se stones, to cleanse
which had been the business of his life.
About the beginning bf this century, he closed his mortal
Joils, being found on the highway near Lockerby, in Dumfries-shire, exhausted and just expiring. The old white pony,
the companion of all his wanderings, was standing by the
side of his dying master. There was found upon his person
a sum of money sufficient for his decent interment, which
304
THE AMERICAN
rLesson 136.serves to show that his death was in no ways hastened by
violence, or by want.
The common people still regard his memory with great
respect; and many are of opinion that the stones which he
repaired will not again require the assis'ance of the chisel.
They even assert, that, on the tombs wi ere the manner of
the martyrs' murder is recorded, their names have remained
indelibly legible since'the death of Old Mortality; while
those of the persecutors, sculptured on the same monuments,
have been entirely defaced.  It is hardly necessary to say
that this is a fond imagination, and that, since the time of
the pious pilgrim, the monuments, which were the objects of
his care, are hastening, like all earthly memorials, into ruin
and decay.

Of that tall pine, the shadow of whose bare
And slender stem, while here I sit at eve,
Oft stretches towards me like a long straight path,
Traced faintly in the green sward; there, beneath
A plain blue stone, a gentle dalesman lies,
From whom, in early childhood, was withdrawn -
The precious gift of hearing. He grew up
F'rom vear to year in loneliness of soul;
And tbhis deep mountain valley was to him
Soundless with all its streams. The bird of dawn
Did never rouse this cottager from sleep
With startling summons: not for his delight
The vernal cuckoo shouted; not for him
Murmured the laboring bee. When stormy winds
Were working the broad bosom of the lake
Into a thousand, thousand sparkling waves,
Rocking the trees, and driving cloud on cloud,
Along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags,
The agitated scene before his eye
Was silent as a picture: evermore
Were all things silent wheresoe'er he moved.
Yet, by the solace of his owvn pure thoughts
Upheld, he duteously pursued the round
Of rural labors; the steep mountain-side
Ascended, with his staff and faithful dog;
The plough he guided, and the sithe he swayed;
And the ripe corn before his sickle fell
Among the j6c'und reapers. For himself,
All watchful. and industrious as he was,
He wroug,ht not; neither field nor flock he owvned:

And when, mature in manhood, he beheld

By the pure bond of independent love,
An inmate of a second family,
The fellow laborer and friend of him
To whom the small inheritance had fallen.
Nor deem that his mild presence was a weight
That pressed upon his brother's house; for books
Were ready comrades* whom he could not tire,Of whose society the blameless man
Was never satiate. Their familiar voice,
Even to old age, with unabated charm
Beguiled his leisuret hours; refreshed his thoughts;
Beyond its natural elevation raised
His introverted spirit; and bestowed
Upon his life an outward dignity
Which all acknowledged. The dark winter night,
The stormy day, had each its own resource;
Song of the muses, sage histcric tale,
Science severe, or word of holy writ,
Announcing immortality and joy
To the assembled spirits of the just,
From imperfection and decay secure.
Thus soothed at home, thus busy in the field,
To no perverse suspicion he gave way,
No languor, peevishness, nor vain complaint:
And they who were about him did not fail
In reverence, or in courtesy; they prized
His gentle manners:-and his peaceful smiles,
The gleams of his slow-varying countenance,
Were met with answering sympathy and love.
At length, when sixty years and five were told,
A slow disease insensibly consumed
The powers of nature; and a few short steps
Of friends and kindred bore him from his home

Under a lucky planet, who to-day
Puts mourning on for his inheritance.
T. When first I heard his death, that very wish

LESSON CXL.
Singuzlar Adventuzre.*
CoLTER came to St. Louis in May 1810, in a small canoe
from the head waters of the Missouri, a distance of 3000(
miles, whlich he travzrsed in 30 days.  I saw him on his arrival, and received from  him an account of his adventures,
after he had separated from Lewis and Clark's party; one
of these, for its singularity, I shall relate.
On the arrival of the party at the head waters of the
Missouri, Coiter, observing  an appearance of abundance of
beaver being there, got permission to remain and, hunt for
some time, which he did in company with a man of the
name of Dixon, whio had traversed the immense trW-~::of
country from St. Louis to the head waters of the Missouri
aJone.  Soon after, he separated from  Dixon, and trapped
mn company with a hunter named Potts; and aware of the
hostility of the Blackfoot Indians, one of whom had been

311killed by Lewis, they set their traps at night, and took them
up early in the morning, remaining concealed during the
day.
They were examining their traps early one morning', in a
creek about six miles from that branch of the Missouri called Jefferson's Fork, and were ascending in a canoe, when
they suddenly heard a great noise, resembling the trampling
of animals; but they could not ascertain the fact, as the
high perpendicular banks on each side of the river impeded
their view.  Colter immediately pronounced it to be occasioned by Indians, and advised an instant retreat, but was
accused of cowardice by Potts, who insisted that the noise
was caused by buffaloes, and they proceeded on.
In a few minutes afterwards their doubts were removed,
by a party of Indians making their appearance on both sides
of the creek, to the amount of five or six hundred, wTho
beckoned them  to come ashore.  As retreat was now impossible, Colter turned the head of the canoe; and, at the
moment of its touching, an Indian seized the rifle belonging
to Potts; but Colter, who is a remarkably strong man, immediately retook it, and handed it to Potts, who remained in
the canoe, and, on receiving- it, pushed off, into the river.
He had scarcely quitted the shore, when an arrow was shot
at him, and he cried out, " Coiter, I arm wounded!" Colter
remonstrated with him on the folly of attempting to escape,
and urged him  to come ashore.  Instead of complying, he
instantly levelled his rifle at the Indian, and shot him dead
on the spot.
This conduct, situated as he was, may appear to have
been an act of madness, but it was doubtless the effect of
sudden but sound reasoning; for, if taken alive, he must
have expecte(i to be tortured to death, according to their custom. He was instantly pierced with arrows so numerous,
that, to use Coiter's words, "'he was made a riddle of."
They now seized Colter, stripped hin  entirely nalked, and
began to consult on the manlner in which he should be put
to death.  They were at first inclined to set him  up as a
mark to shoot at, but the chief interfered, and seizingr him
by the shoulder, a.lked him if he could run fast.
Colter, who had been some time amongst the Kee-katso
or Crow Indians, had in a considerable degree acquired the
Blackfoot language, and Awas also well accquainted with Indian customs; he klnew that he had now to run for his life,
with the dreadful odds of five or six hundred against him,
312
THE AMERICAN
[Lesson 140and those, armed Indians; he therefore cunningly replied,
that he was a very bad runner, although he was considered.
by the hunters as remarkably swift.  The chief now comrnianded the party to remain stationary, and led Colter out
on the prairie three or four hundred yards, and released
him, bidding him save hzimself if hke couZld. At this instant
the horrid war-whoop sounded iLn the ears of poor Coiter,
who, urged with the hope of presnrsving life, ran with a
speed at which himself was suarprised.
He proceeded towards the Jefferson Forlk, havingr to traverse a plain six miles in breadth, aboundin(g with the
prickly pear, oln which he was every instant treading with
his naked feet. He ran nearly half way across the plain,before he ventured to look over his shoulder, when he perceived that the Indians were very much scattered, and that
he had gained ground to a considerable distance from the
main body; but one Indian, who carried a spear, was much
before all the rest, and nlot more than one hundred yards
from him.
A faint gleam  of hope now cheered the heart of Colter,
he derived confidence from the belief that escape was within
the bounds of possibility; but that confidence was nearly
fatal to him; for he exerted himself to such a degree, that
the blood gushed from iiis nostrils, and soon almost covered
the fore part of his body.  He had now arrived within a
mile of the river, when he distinctly heard the appalling
sound of footsteps behind him, and every instant expecced
to feel the spear of his pursuer.  Again he turned his head,
and saw the savage not twenty yards from him.
Determined, if possible, to avoid the expected blow, he
suddenly stopped, turned round, and spread out his arms
The Indian, surprised by the suddenness of the action, and
perhaps by the bloody appearance of Colter, also attempted
to stop,--but, exhausted with running, he fell whilst endeavoring to throw his spear, which stuck in the ground, and
broke.  Cclter instantly snatched up the pointed part, with
which he pinned him to the earth, and then continued his
flight.  The foremost of the Indians, on arriving at the place,
stopped till others came up to join them, when they set up a
hideous yell.  Every moment of this time was improved by
Colter; who, although fainting and exhausted, succeeded in
gaining the skirting of the Cotton-tree wood, on the borders
of the Fork, through which he ran and plunged into the
river.

FIRST CLASS BOOK.Fortunately for him, a little below this place was an
island, against the upper part of which a raft of drift timber
had lodged. He dived under the raft, and, after several efforts, got his head above wrate'r amongst the trunks of trees,
covered over with smaller wood to the depth of several feet.
Scarcely had he secured himself, when the Indians arrived
on the river, screeching and yelling, as Colter expressed it,
" like so many devils."  They were frequently on the raft
during the day, and were seen through the chinks by Colter,
who was congratulating himself on his escape, until the idea
arose that they might set the raft on fire. In horrible suspense he remained until night, when, hearing no more of
the Indians, he dived under the raft, and swam silently
down the river to a considerable distance, where he landed,
and travelled all night.
Although happy in having escaped from the Indians, his
situation was still dreadful; he was completely naked, under
a burning sun--the soles of his feet were entirely filled with
the thorns of the prickly pear-he was hungry, and had no
means of killing game, although he saw abundance around
him-and was at least seven days' journey from Lisa's
Fort, on the Big-horn branch of the Yellow-Stone river
These were circumstances under which almost any man but
an American hunter would have despaired. In seven days,
however, during which he subsisted upon a root much esteemed by the Indians of the Mlissouri, he arrived at the
Fort.
LESSON CXLI.
Xi he discontented pendulum.-JANE TAYLOR.
AN old clock that had stood for fifty years in a farmer's
kitchen, without giving its owner any cause of complaint,
early one summer's morning, before the family was stirring
suddenly stopped.  Upon this, the dial-plate, (if we may
credit the fable,) changed countenance with alarm; the
hands made a vain effort to continue their course; the
wheels remained motionless with surprise; the weigfhts hung
speechless; each member felt disposed to lay the blame on
the others. At length the dial instituted a formal inqcuiry as
to the cause of the stagnation, wxhen hands, wheels, weights,
with one voice protested their innocence.
But now a faint tick was heard below frorn the nendulumwho thus spoke:-" I confess myself to be the sole cause
of the present stoppage; and I am willing, for the generai
satisfaction, to assign my reasons.  The truth is, that I am
tired of ticking."  Upon hearing this, the old clock became
so enraged, that it was on the very point of striking.
"Lazy wire!" exclaimed the dial-plate, holding up its
hands.  "Very good!" replied the penldulum, " it is vastly
easy for you, Mlistress Dial, who have always, as every
body knows, set yourself up above me,-it is vastly easy
for you, I say, to accuse other people of laziness!  You,
who have had nothing to do all the days of your life, but to
stare people in the face, and to amuse yourself with watching all that goes on in the kitchen!  Think, I beseech you,'how you would like to be shut up for life in this dark
closet, and to wag backwvards and forwards, year after year,
as I do."
" As to that," said the dial, " is there not a window in your
house, on purpose for you to look through?"--" For all that,"
resumed the pendulum, "it is very dark here; and although
there is a window, I dare not stop, even for an instant, to
look out at it. Besides, I am really tired of my way of life;
and if you wish, I'll tell you how I took this disgust at my
employment.  I happened this morning to be calculating
how many times I should have to tick in the course of only
the next twenty-four hours; perhaps some of you, above
there, can give me the exact sum."
The minute-hand, being quick at figoures, presently replied, " Eighty-six thousand four hundred times."   " Exactly
so," replied the pendulum; "well, I appeal to you all, if
the very thought of this was not enough to fatigue one; and
xvhen I began to multiply the strokes of one day by those of
months and years, really it is no wonder if I felt discouraged at the prospect; so, after a great deal of reasoning and
hesitation, thinIks I to myself, I'll stop."
The dial could scarcely keep its countenance during this
harangue; but resuming its gravity, thus replied: " Dear
Mr. Pendulum, I am really astonished that such a useful
industrious person as yourself, should have been overcome
by this sudden action.  It is true, you have done a great
deal of work in your time; so have we all, and are likely to
do; which, althoughl it may fatigue us to think of, the question is, whether it will fatigue us to do.  Would you now do
me the favor to give about half a dozen strokes to illustrate
my argument 2"

The pendulum complied, and ticked six times in its usual
pace.  "Now," reulimed the dial, " may    I be allowed to inquire, if that exertion was at all fatizuing or disagreeable to
you?' " Not in the least " replied the pendulum, " it is
not of six strolkes that I complain, nor of sixty, but of millio ns."  "'Very good," replied the dial; "but recollect, that
though you may think of a million strokes in an instant, you
are required to execute but one; and that, however often you
may hereafter have to swino,, a moment will alwrays be given
you to swing in."  C That consideration staggers me, I confess," said the pendulum.  " Then I hope," resumed the dialplate, "we shall all immediately return to our duty; for the
maids will lie in bed if we stand idling thus."
Upon this, the weights, who had never been accused of
light conduct, used all their influence in urging him to proceed; when, as with one consent, the wheels began to turn,
the hands began to move, the pendulum began to swing, and,
to its credit, ticked as loud as ever; while a red beam of
the rising sun that streamed through a hole in the kitchen,
shining full upon the dial-plate, it brightened up, as if nothing had been the matter.
WVhen the farmer came down to breakfast that morning,
upon looking at the clock, he declared that his watch had
gained half an hour in the night.
MTORAL.
A celebrated modern writer says, " Take care of the min-?dtes, anld the houzrs will talie care of themselves."  This is
an admirable remark, and rrmight be very seasonably recollected wvhen we beffin to be "weary in well-doing." from the
thought of having much to do.  The present moment is
all we have to do with, in any sense; the past is irrecoverable; the future is uncertain; nor is it fair to burden one:ioment with the weight of the next.  -Sufficient unto the
mnoment is the trouble thereof.  If we had to walk a hundred rmiles, we should still have to set but one step at a time,
and this pr6cess continued, would infallibly bring us to our
journey's end.  Fatigue generaiily begins, and is always increased, by calculating in a minute the exertion of hours.
Thus, in looking forward to future life, let us recollect
that we have not to sustain all its toil, to endure all its sufferings, or encounter all its crosses, at cnce.  One moment
comes laden with its own little burdens., then flies, and is
succeeded by another no heavier than the last:-if one could
be borne, so can another anc another.
316Even looking forward to a single day, the spirit may
sometimes faint from an anticipation of the duties, the labors, the trials to temper and patieince, that may be expected. Now this is unjustly laying the burden of many thousand moments unon one. Let any one resolve always to do
right now, leaving thFen to do as it can; and if he were to
live to the age of Methuselah, he would never do wrong. But
the common error is to resolve to act right after breakfast, or
after dinner, or to-morrow morning, or next time: but gnow,
3ust now, thzis once, we must go on the same as ever.
It is easy, for instance, for the most ill-tempered person
to resolve that the next time he is provoked, he will not let
his temper overcome him; but the victory would be to subdue temper on the present provocation.  If, without taking
up the burden of the future, we would always make the single effort at the present moment; while there would, at any
one time, be very little to do, yet, by this simple pr6cess continued, every thing would at last be done.
It seems easier to do right to-morrow than to-day, merely
because we forget that when to-morrow comes, then will be
now.  Thus life passes with many, in resolutions for the future, which the present never fulfils.
" It is not thus with those, who, " by patient continuance in
well-doing, seek for glory, honor, and immortality." Day by
day, minute by mninute, they execute the appointed task, to
which the requisite measure of tim.e and strength is proportioned; and thus, having worked while it was called day,
they at length rest from their labors, and their works " follov them."
Let us then, " whatever our hands find to do, do it with
all our might, recollecting that now is the proper and accepted time."

Our hearts bid the tyrants defiance;
Our land,-the first garden of Liberty's treeJt has been, and shall yet be, the land of the free,
For the cross of our faith is replanted,
The pale dying crescent is daunted,
And we marcli that the foot-prints of Mahomet's slaves
May be washed out in blood from our forefathers' graves.
Their spirits are hovering o'er us,
And the sword shall to glory restore us.
Ah! what though no succor advances,
Nor Christendom's chivalrous* lances
Are stretched in our aid?-Be the combatt our own  
And we'll perish or conquer more proudly alone:
For we've sworn, by our country's assaulters,
By the virgins they've dragged from our altars,
By our massacred piatriots, our children in chains,
By our heroes of old, and their blood in our veins,
That living, we will be victorious,
Or that dying, our deaths shall be glorious.
A breath of submission we breathe not:
The sword that we've drawn we will sheathe not
Its scabbard is left where our martyrs are laid,
And the vengeance of ages has whetted its blade.

Letter from the British Spy, in Virginzia.-WIRT.
RIcIisoND, SEPTEMBER 22, 1803.
1 HAVE just returned from an interesting morning's ride.
My object wvas to visit the site of the Indian town, Powhatan; which, you will remember, was the metropolis of the
dominions of Pocahontas' father, and, very probably, the
birthplace of that celebrated princess.
The town was built on the river, about twvo miles below
the ground now occupied by Richmond: that is, about two
miles below the head of tide water.
Aware of the slight manner in which the Indians have
rM I
THE AMER1CAN
[Lesson 146always constructed their habitations, I was not at all disappointed in finding no vestige of the old town. But as I
traversed the ground over which Pocahontas had so often
bounded and froliced in the spriglhtly morning of her
youth, I could not help recalling the principal features of
her history, and heaving a sigh of mingled pity and veneration to her memory.
Good Heaven! What an eventful life was hers! To
speak of nothing else, the arrival of the English in her father's dominions must have appeared (as indeed it iurned
out to be) a most portentous phenomenon.  It is not easy,
for us to conceive the amazernent and consternation which
must have filled her mind and that of her nation at the first
appearance of our countrymen. Their great ship, with all
her sails spread, advancing in solemn majesty to the shore;
their complexion; their dress; their language; their domestic animals; their cargo of new and glittering wealth;
and then the thunder and irresistible force of their artillery;
the distant country announced by them, far beyond the
great water, of which the oldest Indian had never heard,
or thought, or dreamed-all this was so new, so wonderful,
so tremendous, that, I co seriously suppose, the personal
descent of an army of Milton's celestial angels, robed in
light, sporting in the brifht beams of the sun and redoubling,their splendor, making divine harmony with their golden
harps, or playing with the bolt and chasing the rapid lightning of heaven, would excite not more astonishment in
Great Britain, than did the debarkation of the English
among the aborigines of Virginia.
Poor Indians! Where are thev now? Indeed, this is a
truly afflictlng consideration. The people here may say
what they please; but, on the principles of eternal truth and
justice, they have no right to this country. They say that
they have bought it.--Bought it! Yes;--of whom? -Of
the poor trembling natives who knew that refusal would be
vain; and who strove to make a merit of necessity by seeming to yield with grace, what they knew that they had not
the power to retain.  Such a bargain might appease the
conscience of a gentleman of the green bag, "worn and
hackneyed" in the arts and frauds of his profession; but in
heaven's chancery, there can be little doubt that it has been
long since set aside on the ground of compulsion.
Poor wretches! No wonder that they are so implacably
vindictive against the white people; no wonder that the

WHEN a young person who has enioyed the benefit of a
liberal education, instead of leading a life of indolence, dissipation, or vice, elnploys himself in studying the marks of
infinite wisdom and goodness which are manifested in every
part of the visible creation, we know not which we ought
most to congratulate, the public, or the individual.  Selftaught naturalists are often found to make no little pr,gress
* Pron. kwlre.

Lesson 8.1
29rage of resentment is handed down from  generation to
generation; no wonder that they refuse to associate and
mix permanently with their unjust and cruel irvaders and
exter'minators; no wonder that, in the unabatin-: spite and
frenzy of conscious impotence, they wage an eternal war,
as well as they are able; that they triumph in the rare opportunity of revenge; that they dance, sing, and rejoice,
as the victim shrieks and faints amid the flames, when they
imagine all the crimes of their oppressors collected on hihead, and fancy the spirits of their inljured forefathers hovering over the icene, smiling with ferocious delight at the
grateful spectacle, and feasting oil the precious odor as it
arises from the burning blood of the white man.
Yet the people, here, affect to wonder that the Indians
are so very unsusceptible of civilization; or, in other words,
that they so obstinately refuse to adopt the manners of the
white men. Go, Virginian; erase, from the Indian nation,
the tradition of their wrongs; make them forget, if you can,
that once this charming country was theirs; that over these
fields and through these forests, their beloved forefathers,
once, in careless gayety, pursued their sports and hunted
their game; that every returning day found them the sole,
the peaceful, the happy proprietors of this extensive and
beautiful domain.  Make them forget too, if you can, that in
the midst of all this innocence, simplicity, and bliss-the
white man came; and lo!-the animated chase, the feast,
the dance, the song of fearless, thoughtless joy were over;
that ever since, they have been made to drink of the bitter
cup of humiliation; treated like dogs; their lives, their
liberties, the sport of the white men; their country and the
graves of their fathers torn from  them, in cruel succession:
wn-til, driven from  river to river, from  forest to forest, and
through a period of two hundred years, rolled back, nation
upon nation, they find themselves fugitives, vigrants and
strangers in their own country, and look forward to the certain period when their descendants will be totally extin
guished by wars, driven at the point of the bayonet into the
western ocean, or reduced to a fate still more deplorable and
horrid, the condition of slaves.
Go, administer the cup of oblivion to recollection's and
anticipations like these, and then you will cease to complain
that the Indian refuses to be civilized.  But.until then, surely
it is nothing wonderful that a nation even yet bleeding afresh,
from  the memory of ancient wrongs, perpetually agonizedby new outrages, and goaded into desperation and madness
at the prospect of the certain ruin, which awaits their descendants, should hate the authors of their miseries, of their
desolation, their destruction; should hate their manners,
hate their color, their language, their name, and every
thing that belongs to them.  No; never, until time shall wear
out the history of their sorrows and their sufferings, will the
Indian be brought to love the white man, and to imitate his
manners.
Great God! To reflect that the authors of all these
wvrongs were our own countrymen, our forefathers, professors of the meek and benevolent religion of Jesus! O! it
was impious; it was unmanly; poor and pitiful! Gracious
Heaven! what had these poor people done? The simple
inhabitants of these peaceful plains, what wrong, what injury,
had they offered to the Eng,lish? My soul melts with pity
and shame.
As for the present inhabitants, it must be granted that
they are comparatively innocent: unless indeed they also
ha-re encroached under the guise of treaties, which they
themselves have previously contrived to render expedient or
necessary to the Indians.
Whether this have been the case or not, I am too much a
stranger to the interior transactions of this country to decide.  But it seems to me that were I a president of the
United States, I would glory in going to the Indians, throwing
myself on my knees before them, and saying to them, "Indians, friends, brothers, 0! forgive my countrymen! Deeply
have our forefathers wronged you; and they have forced us
to continue the wrong.  Reflect, brothers; it was not our
Fault that we were born in your country; but now, we have
no other home; we have no where else to rest our feet.
Will you not, then, permit us to remain?  Can vou not forgive even us, innocent as we are?  If you can, O! come to
our bosoms; be, indeed, our brothers; and since there is
room enough foi c.s all, give us a home in your land, and
let us be children of the same affectionate family."
I believe that a magnanimity of sentiment like this, folloNwed up by a correspondent greatness of conduct on the
part of the people of the United States, would go farther
to bury the tomahawk and produce a fraternization with the
Indians, than all the presents, treaties, and missionaries that
can be employed; dashed and defeated as these latter means
always are, by a claimn of rights on the part of the white
327
Lesson 146.]
FIRST CLASS BOOK.peop.e which the Indians know to be false and baseless.
Let me not be told that the Indians are too dark and fierce
to be affected by generous and noble sentiments. I will
not believe it. Magnanimitv can never be lost on a natiori which has produced an Alknomok, a Logan, and a
Pocahontas.
The repetition of the name of this amiable princess brings
me back to the point from -which I digressed. I wonder
that the Virginians, fond as they are of anniversaries, have
in:tituted no festival, or order, in honor of her memLory.
For my own part, I have little doubt, from  the histories
which we have of the first attempts at colonizing their
coqntry, that Pocahontas deserves to be considered as the
patrori deity of the enterprise. When it is remembered
how long the colony struggled to get a footing; how often
sickness or famine, neglect at home, mismanagement here,
and- the hostilities of the natives, brought it to the brink of
ruin; throufh what a tedious lapse of time it alternately
languished and revived, sunk and rose, sometimes hanging,
like Addison's lamp, "quivering at a point," then sud.
denly shooting up into a sickly and shortlived flame; in
one word, when we recollect how near and how often it
verged towards total extinction, maugre the pa'tronagp. of
Pocahontas; there is the strongest reason to believe that,
but for her patronage, the anniversary cannon of the fnnlrth
of July would never have resounded throughout the UJi:ted
States.
Is it not probable, that this sensible and amiable woman,
perceiving the superiority of the Europeans, foreseeing the
probability of the subjugation of her countrymen, and snxious as well to soften their destiny, as to save the needless
effusion of human blood, desired, by her marriage with Mr.
Rolfe, to hasten the abolition of all distinction between
Indians and white men; to bind their interests and affections by the nearest and most endearing ties, and to make
them regard themselves, as one people, the children of the
same great family?
If s-uch were her wise and benevolent views, and I have
no doubt but they were, how poorly were they backed by
the British court! No wonder at the resentment and indig'nation with which she saw them neglected; no wonder at
the bittcrness of the disappointment and vexation which she
expressed to captain Smith, in London, arising as well from
the cold reception which she herself had met, as from the'IC)
&amp;- 113
THE AM"IERICAN
[Lesson 146contemptuous and insulting point of view in which she found
that her nation was regarded.
Unfortunate princess! She deserved a happier fate! But
I am consoled by these reflections: first, that she sees her
descendants among the most respectable families in Virginia;
and that they are not only superior to the false shame of
disavowing her as their'incestor, but that they pride themselves, and with reason too, on the honor of their descent,
secondly, that she herself has gone to a country, where she
finds her noble wishes realized; where the distinction of
color is no more; but where, indeed, it is perfectly immaterial "what complexion an Indian or an African sun may
have burned" on the pilgrim.
LESSON CXLVII.
Thanlcsgivin g.-- C RAFTS..
IT is a wise and venerable custom, in New-England, to
set apart one day in the year for the voluntary commemoration of the divine favor, and goodness; and it is pleasing
to see so correct a custom gaining ground in our country.
Not that in New-England, or any where else, it requires a
year to roll over our heads to convince us of the everlasting
mercies of Heaven.  The sublime structure of the universe,
this beautiful landscape, the earth; the magnificent ocean,.
now assailing the clouds with its foam, and then nestling the
little birds on its billows; the glorious sun, and these sweet
sentinels of light, the stars; the voice of the thunder, and
the song of the linnet; who knows any thing of these, and
can, for a moment, doubt the supreme benevolence of the
Almighty!
Yet, although every instant be fruitful in blessings, we are
inattentive, and do not regard; we are ignorant, and do not
appreciate; we are ungrateful, and do not consider; we are
selfish, and will not understand them.  The best require to
be reminded of their duty, and the thoughtless must be told
of it always. It is wise, therefore, to select the season of
gladness, and point to the source of good.  When the husbandman rejoices for the harvest is ripe, and the poor go
into the field to glean
The sheaves, which God ordains to bless
The widow and the fatlherless,
it becomes man to acknowledge the reward of his labors

312.the blessing of his hopes, and the goodness of the giver of
all things.  Then, especially, should he pour forth the grateful incense of his praise, and his devotion.
The Almighty deserves the praise of his creatures. The
flower pays its worship in fragrant exhalation, and the lark
when he carols at the gate of heaven, in praise of their glorious Maker. The sun burns incelise daily, and the virgin
stars keep nightly vigils; the mysterious anthem of the forest
proclaims its devotion, and the sea declares its obedience
as it murmurs into repose.  Every moment of time bears an
errand of mercy, and should not be allowed to pass withost
an acknowledgment of gratitude.

influence still more widely; in the full conviction that that
is the happiest society which partakes in the highest degree
of the ir ild and peaceable spirit of Christianity.
The hours of this day are rapidly flying, and this occasiLn will soJon be passed.  Neither we nor our children can
expect to behold its return.  They are in the distant regions
of futurity, they exist only in the all-creating power of God,
who shall stand here, a hundred years hence, to trace,
through us, their descent from the pilgrims, anJ to survey,
as we have now  surveyed, the pr6gress of their country
during the lapse of a century.  We would anticipate their
concurrence with us in our sentiments of deep regard for
our common ancestors.  We would anticipate and partake
the pleasure with which they will then recount the steps of
New-England's advancement.  On the morning of that day,
although it will not disturb us in our repose, the voice of
acclamation and gratitude, commencing on the rock of Ply
mouth, shall be transmitted through millions of the sons of
the pilgrims, till it lose itself in the murmurs of the Pacific
seas.
WVre would leave, for the consideration of those who shall
then occupy our places, some proof that we hold the blessings transmitted from our fathers in just estimation; some
proof of our attachment to the cause of good government,
and of civil and religious liberty; some proof of a sincere
and ardent desire to promote every thing which may enlarge
the understandings and improve the hearts of men.  And
when, from the long distance of a hundred years, they shall
look back upon us, they shall know, at least, that we possessed affections, which, running backward, and warming
withl gratitude for what our ancestors have done for our
happiness, run forward also to our posterity, and meet them
with cordial salutation, ere yet they have arrived on the
shore of Being.
Advance, then, ye future generations! YWe would hail
you, as you rise in your long succession, to fill the places
which we now fill, and to taste the blessings of existence
where we are passing, and soon shall lhave passed, our human
duration.  We bid you welcome to this pleasant land of

As from the haughty palace. He whose soul
Ponders its true equality, may walk
The fields of earth with gratitude and hope;
Yet, in that meditation, will he find
Motive to sadder grief, when his thoughts turn
From nature's justice to the social wrongs
That make such difference betwvixt man and man.

And best protection, this imperial realm*
While she exacts allegiance, shall admit

335in hknowledge, and to strike out many new lights, by the mere
aid of original genius and patient application. But the well
educated youth engages in these pursuits with peculiar advantage.  He takes more comprehensive views, is able to
consult a greater variety of authors, and, from  the early
habits of his mind, is more accurate and more methodical in
all his investigations.  The world at large, therefore, cannot
fail to be benefited by his labors; and the value of the enjoyments, which at the same time he secures to himself, is
beyond all calculation.  No tedious, vacant hour ever makes
him wish for he knows not what-complain, he knows not

to do, compel him to seek a momentary stimulus to his dormant powers in the tumultuous pleasures of the intoxicating

Whether he be at home or abroad, in every different clime,
and in every season of the year, universal nature is before

teem with objects that keep his attention perpetually awake,
excite him to healthful activity, and charm him with an ever
varying succession of the beautiful, the wonderful, the useful, and the new.  And if, in conformity with the direct tendency of such occupations, he rises from the creature to the
Creator, and considers the duties which naturally result from
his own situation and rank in this vast system of being, he
will derive as much satisfaction from the anticipation of the
future, as from  the experience of the present, an-d the recollection of the past.  The mind of the pious naturalist is always cheerful, always animated with the noblest and most
benign feelings.  Every repeated observation, every unexpected discovery, directs his thoughts to the great Source of
all order, and all good; and harmonizes all his faculti(e
with the general voice of nature.

With his conceptions; act upon his plan,

Of sighing winds on the foamy billow;

So deep, so calm, and so holy a feeling:'Tis soft as the thrill which memory throws
Athwart the soul in the hour of repose.

counts a single breathing inhabitant for every ten silent inmates of this city of the dead.  Already do its fields of
blooming sepulchres stretch far away on every side, across
the brow of the hills and the bend of the vaileys; already
are the avenues which cross each other at every step in this
domain of death so lengthened, that the weary stranger,
from  whatever point he comes, still finds before him many
a dreary mile of road between marshalled tombs and mournful cypresses, ere he reaches his journey's seemingly receding end; and yet, every year does this common patrimony of all the heirs to decay still exhibit a rapidly increasIng size, a freshl and wider line of boundary, and a new

minds and hearts to relax and expand in the happy consciousness of perfect security from invidious remark and carping
criticism; where we may give the reins to the sportiveness
of innocent fancy, or the enthusiasm of warm-hearted feeling; where we may talk s.ense or nonsense, (I pity people

point, iishe hair balance of propriety and good breeding.
It is equally delightful to let the pen talK freely, and unpremeditatedly, and to one by whom we are sure of being
understood; but a formal letter, like a ceremonious morning
visit, is tedious alike to the writer and receiver-for the
most part spun out with unmeaning phrases, trite observations, complimentary fourishes, and pr6testations of respect
and attachment, so far not deceitful, as they never deceive
any body.  Oh the misery of having to compose a set,
proper, well worded, correctly pointed, polite, elegant epistle!-one that must have a beginning, a middle, and an end,
as methodically arranged alnd portioned out as the several
parts of a serrron under three heads, or the three gradations
of shade in a school-girl's first landscape!
For my part, I would rather be set to beat hemp, or
wveed in a turnip-field, than to write such a letter exactly
every month, or every fortnight, at the precise point of time
from the date of our correspondent's last letter, that he or
she wrote after the reception of ours-as if one's thoughts
bubbled up to the well-head, at regular periods, a pint at
a time, to be bottled off for immediate use.  Thought,! what
has thought to do in such a correspondence? It mlvrders
thou.ght, quenches fancy, wastes time, spoils paper, wears
out innocent goose-quills- "I'd rather be a kitten, and cry
mew! than one of those same" prosing letter-mongers.
Surely in this age of invention something may be struck
out to obviate the necessity (if such necessity exists) of so
tasking-degrading the huurian intellect.  Why should not a
sort of mute barrel-organ be constructed on the plan of
those that play sets of tunes and country dances, to indite
a catalogue of polite epistles calculated for all the ceremoInious observances of good breeding? Oh the unspeakable

flowers without shadow--Oh! no-the epistolary steamengine will never come into vogue with those dear creatures-They must enjoy the " feast of reason, and the flow

I believe,) to indite a dutiful epistle to an honored aunt?
I rememlr, as if it were yesterday, the moment when
she who had enjoined the task entered to inspect the performance, which, by her calculation, should have been fully
completed--I remember how  sheepishly I hung down my
head, when she snatched from before me the paper, (on which
I had made no further progress than " My dear ant,") angrily exclaiming, " What, child! have you been shut up here
three hours to call your aunt a pismire."  From that hour
of humiliation I have too often groaned under the endurance
of similar penance, and I have learnt from my own sufferings to compassionate those of my dear sisters in affliction.
To such unhappy persons, then, I would fain offer a few
hints, (the fruit of long experience,) which, if they have not
already been suggested by their own observation, may prove
serviceable in the hour of emergency.
Let them - - - or suppose I address myself to one particular sufferer-there is something more confidential in that,

"Heart speaks to heart"--I say, then, take always special
care to write by candlelight, for not only is the apparently
unimportant operation of snuffing the candle in itself a
momentary relief to the depressing consciousness of mehtal
vacuum, but not unfrequently that trifling act, or the brightening flame of the taper, elicits, as it were, from the dull
embers of fancy, a sympathetic spark of fortunate conception-When such a one occurs, seize it quickly and dexterously, but, at the same time, with such cautious prudence, as
not to huddle up and contract in one short, paltry sentence,
that which, if ingeniously handled, mav be wire-drawn,
so as to undulate gracefully and smoothly over a whole
page.
For the more ready practice of this invaluable art of dilating, it will be expedient to stock your memory with a large
assortment of those precious words of many syllables, that
fill whole lines at once; " incomprehensibly, amazingly, decidedly, solicitously, inconceivably, incontrovertibly."  An
opportunity of using these, is, to a distressed spinner, as delightful as a copy all m's and n's to a child.  "Command

the use of them necessarily creates such a space between

The pleasures of a cultivated Imagination.--DUGALD
STEWART.
THE attention of young persons may be seduced, by well
selected works of fiction, from  the present objects of the
senses, and the thoughts accustomed to dwell on the past,
the distant or the future; and in the same proportion in
which this effect is, in any instance, accomplished, "the
man," as Dr. Johnson has justly remarked, " is exalted in
the scale of intellectual being."  The tale of fiction will
probablv be soon laid aside with the toys and rattles of i.nfancy; but the habits which it has contributed to fix, and
the powers which it has brought into a state of activity, will
remain with the possessor, permanent and inestimable treasures, to his latest hour.
Nor is it to the young alone that these observations are
to be exclusively applied.  Instances have frequently occurred of individuals, in whom the power of imagination
has, at a more advanced period of life, been found susceptible of culture to a wonderful degree.  In such men, what
an accession is gained to their most refined pleasures  
WThat enchantments are added to their most ordinary perceptions! The mind awakening, as if from a trance, to a
new  existence, becomes hobituated to the most interestinlg
aspects of life and of nature; the intellectual eye " is purged of its film;" and things the most familiar and unnoticed,
disclose charms invisible before.
The same objects and events whichv were lately beheld
with indifference, occupy new all the powers and capacities of the soul: the contrast between the present and the
past serving only to enhance and to endear so unlooked for
an acquisition. What Gray has so finely said of the'pleaszires of vicissitude, conveys but a faint image of what is experienced by the man, who, after having lost in vulgar occupations and vulgar amusements, his earliest and most
precious years, is thus introduced at last to a new  heaven
and a new earth:
"The meanest floweret of the vale,
The simplest note that swells the gale,
The common sun, the air, the ski3s,
To him are opening Paradise."
Lesson 9.]
31this charming country.  Indeed, it is too disastrous to be
related or read with indifference.
If you have a large map of Switzerland, I beg of you to
look for a spot in the canton of Schweitz,* situated between
the lakes of Zug and Lowertz on two sides, and the mountains of Rigi and Rossberg on the others.  Here, but three
weeks ago, was one of the most delightfully fertile valleys
of all Switzerland; green, and luxuriant, adorned with several little villages, full af secure aild happy farmers.  Now
three of these villages are for ever effaced from the earth;
and a broad waste of ruins, burying alive more than fourteen
hundred peasants, overspreads the valley of Lowertz.
About five o'clock in the evening of the 3d of September,
a large projection of the mountain of Rossberg, on the northeast, gave way, and precipitated itself into this valley; and
in less than four minutes completely overwhelmed the three
villages of Goldau, Busingen, and Rathlen, with a part of
Lowertz and Oberart.  The torrent of earth and stones was
far more rapid than that of lava, and its effects as resistless
and as terrible.  The mountain in its descent carried trees,
rocks, houses, every thing before it. The mass spread in
every direction, so as to bury completely a space of charming country, more than three miles square.
The force of the earth must have been prodigious, since
it not only spread over the hollow of the valley, but even
ascended far up the opposite side of the Rigi. The quantity
of earth, too, is enormous, since it has left a considerable hill
in what was before the centre of the vale.  A portion of the
falling mass rolled into the lake of Lowertz, and it is calculated that a fifth part is filled up.  On a minuite map you
will see two little islands marked in this lake, which have
been admired for their picturesqueness. One of them is
famous for the residence of two hermits, and the other for
the remains of an ancient chateau,t once belonging to the
house of Hapsburg.
So large a body of water was raised and pushed forward
by the falling of such a mass into the lake, that the two
islands, and the whole village of Seven, at the southern
extremity, were, for a time, completely submerged by the
passing of the swell.  A large house in this villaoge was lifted
off its foundations and carried half a mile beyond its place.
The hermits were absent on a pilgrimage to a distant abbey.
The disastrous consequences of this event extend further

licle population.  A fertile plain is at once converted into a
barren tract of rocks and calcareous earth, and the former
marks and boundaries of property obliterated.  The main
road from  Art to Schweitz is completely filled up, so the
another must be opened with great labor over the Rigi
The former channel of a large stream is choked up, and its
course altered; and, as the outlets and passagre of large
bodies of water must be affected by the filling up of such a
portion of the lake, the neighboring villages are still trembling with apprehension of some remnote consequence, against
which they know not how to provide. Several hundred
men have been employed in opening passages for the stagnant waters, in forming a new road for foot passengers along
the Rigi, and in exploring the ruins.  The different cantons
have contrib'uted to the relief of the suffering canton of
Schweitz, and every head is at work to contrive means to
prevent further disasters.
The number of inhabitants buried alive, under the ruins
of this mountain is scarcelv less than fifteen hundred.  Some
even estimate it as high as two thousand.  Of these, a woman
and two children have been found alive, after having been
several days under ground. They affirm that while they
were thus entornbed, they heard the cries of creatures who
were perishing around them, for want of that succor which
they were so happy as to receive. Indeed, it is the opinion
of many well informed people, that a large number might
still be recovered; and a writer in the Publiciste goes so far
as to blame the inactivity of the neighboring inhabitants;
and quotes many well-attested facts to prove, that persons
have lived a long time, buried under snow and earth.
This at least is probable in the present case, that many
houses, exposed to a lighter weight than others, may have
been merely a little crushed, while the lower story, which,
in this part of Switzerland, is frequently of stone, may have
remained firm, and thus not a few of the inhabitants escaped
unhurt.  The consternation, into which the neighborino
towns of Art and Schweitz were thrown, appears indeed to
have left them incapable of contriving and executing those
labors, which an enlightened compassion would dictate.
The mountain of Rossberg, as well as the Rigi, and other
nmountains in its vicinity, is composed of a kind of brittle
calcareous earth, and pudding stone or aggregated rocks
Such a prodigious mass as that which fell, would easily
Ltesson 156.]
347crumble by its own wei(ght, and spread over a wide surface.
The bed of the mountain, from which the desolation came,
is a plane inclined from north to south.  Its appearance, as
it is now laid bare, would lead one to suppose that the mass,
when it first moved from  its base, slid for some distance
before it precipitated itself into the valley. The height of
the Spitzberg--the name of the projection which fell-above
the lake and valley of Lowertz, rwas little less than two
thousand feet.
The composition of the chain of the Rigi, of which the
Rossberg makes a part, has always been an obstacle in the
way of those system-makers, wlho have built their hypotheses
upon the structure of the Alps.  It has nothing granitic in
its whole mass, and though nearly six thousand feet above
the sea, is green and even fertile to its summit. It is composed of nothing but earth and stone, combined in rude
masses.  It is also remarkable that the strata of whllich it is
clr(mposed, are distinctly inclined from the north toward the
st, th, a character which is common to all rocks of this kind
through the whole range of Alps, as well as to the greater
part of calcareous, schistous, and pyritic rocks, and also to
the whole chain of the Jura.
It was about a week after the fall of the mountain, that
our route through Switzerland led us to visit this scene of
d-solation; and never can I forget the succession of melancholy views, which presented themselves to our curiosity.
In our way to it, we landed at Art, a town, situated at the
southern extremity of the lake of Zug; anld we skirted along
the western boundary of the ruins, by the side of Mount
Rigi, towards the lake of Lowertz.  From  various points
on our passage, we had complete views of such a scene of
destruction, as no words can adequately describe.
Picture to yourself a rude and mingled mass of earth and
stones, bristled with the shattered parts of wooden cottages,
and with thousands of heavy trees, torn up by the roots,
and projecting in every direction. In one part you might
see a range of peasants' huts, which the torrent of earth
had reached with just force enough to overthrow and tear
in pieces, but without bringing soil enough to cover them.
In another were mills broken in pieces by huge roclks, transported from  the top of the mountains, which fell, and were
carrie(d high up the opposite side of the Rigi.  Large pools
of water had formed themselves in different parts of the
ruins, and many little streams, w7hose usual channels hadbeen filled up, were bursting out in various places.  Birds
of prey, attracted by the smell of dead bodies, were hovering all about the valley.
But the general impression made upon us by the sight of
such an extent of desolation, connected, too, with the:dea
that hundreds of wretched creatures were at that moment
alive, buried under a mass of earth, and inaccessible to the
cries and labors of their friends, was too horrible to be described or understood. As we travelled along the borders
of the chaos of ruined buildings, a poor peasant, wearing a
countenance ghastly with wo, came up to us to beg a piece
of money.  He had three children buried in the ruins of a
cct:age, which lie was endeavoring to clear away.
A little furtheri cn, we came to an elevated spot, which
overlooked the whole scene.  Here we found a painter
seated on a rock, and busy in sketching its horrors.  He
had chosen a most favorable point.  Before him, at the
distance of more than a league, rose the Rossberg, from
whose bare side had rushed the destroyer of all this life and
beaunty.  On his right was the lake of Lowertz, partly filled
with thle earth of the mountain.  On the banks of t-iis lake
was a1l that remained of the town of Lowertz. Is church
was demolished; but the tower yet stood amid the ruins,
shattered, but not thrown down.
The figures, which animated this part of the drawing,
were a few miserable peasants, left to grope among the
wrecks of one half their village.  The foreground of the
picture was a wide desolate sweep of earth and stones, relieved by the shattered roof of a neighboring cottage.  On
the left hand spread the blue and tranquil surface of the
lake of Zug, on the margin of which vet stands the pleasant
village of Art, almost in contact withi the ruins, and trembling even in its preservation.
We proceeded in our descent, along the side of the Rigi,
toward the half-buried village of Lowertz.  Here we saw
the poor curate, who is said to have been a spectator of the
fall of the mountain.  He saw the torrent of earth rushing
toward his village, overwhelming half his people, and stopping just before his door! What a situation! He appeared,
as we passed, to be superintendinc tne labors of some of
the survivors, who were exploring the ruins of the place.
A numliber of new-made graves, marked with a plain pine
cross, showed where a few of the wretched victims of this
catastrophe had just been interred.

[Lesson 156.
Our course -ay along the borders of the enchanting lake
of Lowertz.  The appearance of the slopes, on the eastern
arnd southern sides, told us what the valley of Goldau was a
few days since, smiling with varied vegetation, gay with villages and cottages, and bright with promises of autumnal
plenty.  The shores of this lake were covered with ruins of
huts, with hay, with furniture and clothes, which the vast
swell of its waters had lodged on the banks. As we were
walking mournfully along towards Schweitz, we met with
the dead body of a woman, which had been just found. It
was stretched out on a board, and barely covered with a
white cloth.  Two men, preceded by a priest, were carrying it to a more decent burial.
We hoped that this sight would have concluded the horrors of this day's scenery, and that we should soon escape
from every painful vestige of the calamity of Schweitz.  But
we continued to find relics of ruined buildings for a league
along the whole extent of the lake; and a little beyond the
two islands, mentioned above, we saw, lying on the shlore,
the stiff body of a peasant, which had been washed up by the
wraves, and Nwhich two men were examining, to ascertain
where he belonged.  Our guide instantly knew it to be one
of the inhabitants of Goldau.  But I will mention no more
particulars.  Some perhaps that have been related to me are
not credible, and others which are credible are too painful.
The inmmediate cause of this calamitous event is not yet
sufficiently ascertained and probably never will be.  The
fall of parts of hills is not uncommon; and i_n Switzerland
especially, there are several instances recorded of the descent of large masses of earth and stones.  But so sudden
and extensive a ruin, as this, was, perhaps, never produced
by the fall of a mountain.  It can be compared only to the
destruction made by the tremendous eruptions of Etna and
Xe.suvius.
Many persons suppose that the long and copious rains,
which they have lately had in this part of Switzerlnmd, may
have swelled the mountains, in the Rossberg, sufficiently to
push this part of the mountain off its inclined base.  But we
saw no marks of streams issuing from aLy part of the bed
which is laid bare.  Perhaps the consistency of the earth
in the interior of the mountain was so much altered by the
moisture wrhich penetrated into it, that the projection of the
Spitzberg was no longer held by a sufficiently strong cohesion, and its own wreight carried it over.  Perhaps, as theearth is calcareous, a kind of fermentation took pl'lce slfficient to loosen its foundations.  But there is no end to conjectures. The mountain has fallen, and the villages are no
mlor(re.

And repeat the young huntsman's cry;That clatter and laugh when the goatherds take
Their browzing flocks, at the morning's break,
Far over the hills,-not one is awake
In the swell of thy peaceable sky.
They sit on that wave with a motionleos wing,
And their cy-mrlbals are mute; and the desert birds sing
Their unanswered notes to the wave and the sky,
As they stoop their broad wing and go sluggishly by:
For deep, in that blue-bosomed water, is laid
As innocent, true, and as lovely a maid
As ever in cheerfulness carolled her song,
In the blithe mountain air, as she bounded alorg.
The heavens are all blue, and the billow's bright verge
Is frothily laved by a whispering surge,
That heaves, incessant, a tranquil dirge,
To lull the pale forms that sleep below:Forms that rock as the waters flow.

And when o'er its bosom the swift clouds fly,

Soft over its bosom the dim vapors hover

No mantle of wrath over heaven was thrown;
No armies of light with their banners of flame,
On neighing steeds, through the sunset came,
Or leaping from space appeared:
No earthquake reeled: no Thunderer stormed:
No fetterless dead o'er the bright sky swarmed:
No voices in heaven were heard.
But, the hour when the sun in his pride went down,
While his parting hung rich o'er the world,
While abroad o'er the sky his flush mantle was blown

In gold and crimson vapors drest,
To where a people are at rest.
Slowly it came in its mountain wrath;
And the forests vanished before its path;
And the rude cliffs bowed; and the waters fled;
And the living were buried, while over their head
They heard the full march of their foe as he sped;--
And the valley of life was the tomb of the deadThe mountain-sepulchre of all I loved!

What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn,,
Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,
Oft till the star, that rose, at evening bright,
Toward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.
AMeanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,

Rough Satyrs danced, and Fauns with cloven heel
From the glad sound would not be absent long;

Now thou art gone, and never must return!

Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.
As killing as the canker to the rose,

Or frost to flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear,

Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?

Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,
Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,
Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream:

What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,
The Muse herself, for her enchanting son,
Whom  universal nature did lament,
When, by the rout that made the hideous roar,
His gory visage down the stream was sent,
Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?
Alas! what boots it with incessant care
To tend tlhe homely, slighted, shepherd's trade,
And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?
Were it not better done, as others use,
To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,
Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?

356iThe eiTects of foreign travel have been often remarked,
not only in rous;ng the curiosity of the traveller while
abroad, but in correcting, after his return, whatever habits
of inattention he had contracted to the institutions and-manners among which he was bred.  It is in a way somewhat
analogous, that our occasional excursions into the regions of
imagination increase our interest in those familiar realities
from which the stores of imagination are borrowed.  We
learn insensibly to view nature with the eye of the painter
and the poet, and to seize those "happy attitudes of things"
which their taste at first selected; while, enriched with the
accumulations of ages, and with "the spoils of time," we
unconsciously corabine with what we see, all that we know
and all that we feel; and sublime the organical beauties of
the material world, by blending with them  the inexhaustible delights of the heart and of the fancy.
LESSON X.
The happiness of aninmals a proof of the divine benevolence.PALEY.
Timu air, the earth, the water, teem with delighted existence. In a spriPg noon or a summer evening, on whichever side we turn our eyes, myriads of happy beings crowd
upon our view.  "The insect youth are on the wing'
Swarms of new-born flies, are trying their pinions in the
air. Their sportive motions, their gratuitous activity, their
continual change of place without use or purpose, testify
their joy, and the exultation which they feel in their lately
discovered faculties.
A bee amongst the flowers in spring, is one of the most
cheerful objects that can be looked upon.  Its life appears
to be all enjoyment: so busy and so pleased: yet it is only
a specimen of insect life, with which, by reason of the animal being half domesticated, we happen to be better acquainted than we are with that of others.  The whole winged insect tribe, it is probable, are equally intent upon their
proper employments, and un1der every variety of constitution gratified, and perhaps equlally gratified, by the offices
which the Author of their natlire has assigned to them.
But the atmosphere is not the only scene of their enjoy[Lesson 10.Bring the rath primrose that forsaken dies,
The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,
The white pink, and the panzy freaked with jet,
The glowing violet,
The musk-rose, and the well attired woodbine,
With co.-slips wan that hang the pensive head,
And every flower that sad embroidery wears:
Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed,
And daffodillies fill their cups with tears,
To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies.
For, so to interpose a little ease,  
Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise;
Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled,
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,
Where thou, perhaps, under the whelming tide,
Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;
Or whether thou to our moist vows denied,
Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,
VWhere the great vision of the guarded mount
Looks towara Namancos and Bayona's hold;
Look homeward, angel, now, and melt with ruth:
And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth.
Weep no more, woful shepherds, -weep no more,
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor;
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,
And yet anon repairs his drooping head,
And tricks his beams, and, with new-spangled ore,
Flames in the f6rehead of the morning sky:
So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,
Through the dear might of him that walked the waves;
Where other groves and other streams along,
With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,
And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,
In the blest kingdomns meek of joy and love.
There entertain him all the saints above,
In solemn troops, and sweet societSes,
That sing, and singing, in their glory move
And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.
Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;
ltenzeforth thou art the genius of the shore,
1n thy larrge recompense, and shalt be good'~  all thlat wander iii that perilous flood.

A Thunder-storm, among the Highlands of Scotland.-WiVnisoN.
AN enormous thunder-cloud had lain all day over BenNevis, shrouding its summit in thick darkness, blackening
its sides and base, wherever they were beheld from the
surrounding country, with masses of deep shadow, and especially flinging down a weight of gloom upon that magnificent glen that bears the same name with the mountain,
till now the afternoon was like twilight, and the voice of all
the streams was distinct in the breathlessness of the vast
solitary hollow. The inhabitants of all the straths, vales,
glens, and dells, round and about the monarch of Scottish
mountains, had, during each successive hour, been expecting
the roar of thunder and the deluge of rain; but the huge
conglomeration of lowering clouds would not rend asunder,
although it was certain that a calm, blue sky cotld not be
restored till all that dreadful assemblage had melted away
into torrents, or been driven off by a strong wind from the sea.
All the cattle on the hills, and in the hollows, stood still
or lay down in their fear-the wild deer sought in herds the
shelter of the pine-covered cliffs-the raven hushed his
hoarse croak in some grim cavern, and the eagle left the
dreadful silence of tile upper heavens. Now and then the
shepherds looked from their huts, while the shadow of the
thunder-clouds deepened the hues of their plaids and tartans;
and at every crealting of the heavy branches of the pines,
or wide-armed oaks, in the solitude of their inaccessible
birth-place, the hearts of the lonely dwellers quaked, and
they lifted up their eyes to see the first wide flash-the disparting of the masses of darkness-and paused to hear the
long, loud rattle of' heaven's artillery, sliaking the foundations of the everlasting mountains.  But all was yet silent.

Levsou 159.]The peal came at last, and it seemed ae  if an earthquake
had smote the silence.  Not a tree-not a blade of grass
nmoved, but the blow stunned, as it were, the heart of the
solid globe.  Then was there a low, wild, whispering, wailing voice, as of many spirits all joining together from every
point of heaven-it died away-and then the rushing of rain
was heard through the darkness; and, in a few minutes,
down came all the mountain torrents in their power, and
the sides of all the steeps were suddenly sheeted, far and
wide, with waterfalls.  The element of water was let loose
to run its rejoicing race-and that of fire lent it illumination,
whether sweeping in floods along the great open straths, or
tumbling in cataracts from cliffs overhanging the eagle's
eyrie.*
Great rivers were suddenly flooded-and the little mountain rivulets, a few minutes before only silver threads, and
in whose fairy basins the minnow played, were now scarcely fordable to shepherds' feet.  It was time for the strongest
to take shelter, and none now would have liked to issue from
it; for a while there was real danger to life and limb in the
many raging torrents, and in the lightning's flash, the imagination and the soul themselves were touched with awe in
the long resounding glens, and beneath the savage scowl of
the angry sky.  It was such a storm  as becomes an era
among the mountains; and it was felt that before next
morning there would be a loss of lives-not only among the
beasts that perish, but among human  beings overtaken by
the wrath of that irresistible tempest,

forefathers.  When he comes-you will leave us by ourselves
-even my little Flora will go with. you into the air for a
little. The rain--is it not over and gone?  And I hear no
wind-only the voice of streams."
The sound of horses' feet was now on the turf before the
door of the Shealing--and IMr. Macdonald came in with a
friend.  The dying man looked towards his priest with a
happy countenance, and blessed him in the name of Godof Christ-and of his blessed mother.  He then uttered a
few indistinct words addressed to the person who accompanied him-and there was silence in the Shealing.
"I was from home when the messenger carne to my house
-but he found me at the house of Mr. Christie, the clergyman of the Enrglish church at Fort-William, and he would
not suffer me to com.~ up the glen alone-so you nrow see
him- along with me, Lewis.". The dying man said, "This
indeed is Christian charity.  HIere, in a lonely Shealino, by
the death-bed of a poor old man, are standing three ministers
of God-each of a different persuasion-a Catholic--an
Episcopal-and a Presbyter. All of you have been kind
to me for several years-and now you are all anxious foi
the salvation of my soul.  God has indeed been merciful to
me a sinner."
The Catholic Priest was himself an old man--although
thirty years younger than poor Lewis Cameron-and he was
the faithful shepherd of a small flock.  He wa_: revered by
all who knew him, for the apostolical fervor of his faith, the
simplicity of his manners, and the blamelessness of his life.
An humble man among the humble, and poor in spirit in the
huts of the poor. But he had one character in the Highland
glens, where he was known only as a teacher and comforter
of the souls of his little flock--and another in the wide world,
where his name was not undistinguished among those of
men gifted with talent and rich in erudition. He had passed
his youth in foreign countries-but had returned to the neighborhood of his birth-place as his life was drawing towards
a close, and for several years had resided in that wild region,
esteeming his lot, although humble, yet high, if through him
a few sinners were made repentant, and r6signation brought
by his voice to the dying bed.
With this good man had come to the lonely Shealing AMr.
Christie, the Episcopalian Clergymain, who had received his
education in an English University, and brought to the disLessonL ].60.]
359charge of his duties in this wild region, a mil,d cultivated
by classical learning, and rich in the literature and philosophy of Greece and Rome. Towar(ds himn, a very young
person, the heart of the old Priest had warmed on their very
first meetin,g! and they really loved each other quite like
ither and son.
The character of _Mr. Gordon, although unlike theirs in
almost all respects, was yet not uncongenial.  His strong
native sense, his generous feelings, his ardenit zeal, were all
estimated by them as they deserved; and while he wUillingly
bowed to their superior talents and acquirements, he mainta.ined an equality with them  both, in that devotion to his
sacred duties, and Christian care of the souls of his flock,
without which a minister can neither be respectable nor
happy.  In knowledg,e of the character, customs, modes of
thinking and feeling, and the manners of the people, he was
greatly superior to both his friends; and his advice, although
always given with diffidence, and never but when asked,
was most useful to them in the spiritual guidance of theit
ov:n flocks.
This friendlv and truly Christian  intercourse having
subsisted for several years between these three  ministers
of religion, the blessed effects ol it were visible, and were
deeply and widely felt in the hearts of the inhabitants of
this district.  All causes of jealousy, dislike, and disunion,
seemed to vanish into air, between people of these different
persuasions, when they saw  the true regard which they
whom they most honored and revered thus cherished for
one another: and when the ordinary unthinking prejudices
were laid aside, from which springs so much embitterment
of the very blood, an appeal was then made, and seldoml in
vain, to deeper feelings in the heart, and nobler principles
in the understanding, which otherwise would have remained
inoperative.
Thus the dwellers in the glens and on the mountains,
without ceasing to love and delight in their own mode of
worship, and without losing a single hallowed association
that clung to the person of the Minister of God, to the walls
of the house in which he was worshipped, to the words in
which the creature humbly addressed the Creator; or to the
ground in which they were all finally to be laid at rest, yet
all lived and died in mutual toleration and peace. Nor could
there be a more affectingg example of this, than what was
now seen even in the low and lonely Shealing of poo old

THE AMERtICANLewis Cameron. His breath had but a few gasps more to
make-but his Shealing was blessed by the presence of
those men whose religion, different as it was in many outward things, and often made to be so fatally different in
essentials too, was now one and the same, as they stood
beside that death-bed, with a thousand torrents sounding
through the evening air, and overshadowed in their devotion
by the gloomr of that stupendous mountain.
All but the gray-haired Priest now left the Shealing, and
sat down together in a beautiful circlet of green, enclosed
with snmall rocks most richly ornamented by nature, even in
this stormy clime, with many a graceful plant and bloomling
flower, to which the art of old Lewis and his Flora had
added blossoms fronm the calmer gardens at the Fort. These
and the heather perfumed the air-for the rain, though
dense and strong, had not shattered a single spray, and every
leaf and every bloom lifted itself cheerfully up begemmed
with large quivering diamond drops. There sat the silent
party-while death was dealing with old Lewis, and the
man of God giving comfort to his penitent spirit.  They
were waiting the event in peace-and even little Flora,
elevated by the presence of these holy men, whose office
seemed now so especially sacred, and cheered by their
fatherly kindness to herself, sat in the middle of the group,
and scarcely shed a tear.
In a little while, Mr. MIacdonald came out from the Shealing, and beckoned on one of them to approach. They did
so, one'after the other, and thus singly took their last farewell of the ancient man. His agonies and strong convulsions were all over-he was now blind-but he seemed to
hear their voices still, and to be quite sensible. Little Flora
was the last to go in-and she staid the longest. She came
out sobbing, as if her heart would break, for she had kissed
his cold lips, from which there was no breath, and his eyelids that fell not down over the dim orbs.
" He is dead-he is dead!" said the child: and she went
and sat down, with her face hidden by her hands, on a stone
at some distance from the rest, a little birch tree hanging its
limber sprays over her head, and as the breeze touched them,
letting down its clear dew-drops on her yellow hair. As she
sat there, a few goats, for it was now the hour of evening

laid its head on her knees.
The evening had sunk down upon the glen, but the tempest was over, and though the torrents had not yet begun
to subside, there was now a strong party, and no danger in
their all journeying homewards together.  One large star
arose in heaven-and a wide white glimmer over a breaking
mass of clouds told that the moon was struggling througih,
and in another hour, if the upper current of air flowed oni
would be apparent.  No persuasion could induce little Flora
to leave the Shealing-and Hamish Frazer was left to sit
with her all night beside the bed. So the company departed
-and as they descended into the great glen, they heard the
wild wail of the pipe, mixing with the sound of the streams
and the moaning of cliffs and caverns.  It was Hamish
Frazer pouring out a lament on the green before the Shealing-a mournful but martial tune, which the old soldier had
loved, and which, if there were any superstitious thoughts
in the soul of him who was' playing, might be supposed to
sooth the spirit yet lingering in the dark hollow of his native
niountains.  
LESSON CLXI.
Religion and Superstition contrasted.--MRs. CARTER.
I HAD lately a very remarkable dream, which made so
strong an impression on me, that I remember every word of
it; and if you are not better employed, you may read the
relation of it as follows.
[ thought I was in the midst of a very entertaining set of
company, and extremely delighted in attending to a lively
conversation, when, on a sudden, I perceived one of the
most shocking figures that imagination can frame, advancing
towards me. She was dressed in black, her skin was cont.racted into a thousand wrinkles, her eyes deep sunk irn her
head, and her complexion pale and livid as the countenance
of death. Her looks were filled with terror andl unrelenting severity, and her hands armed with whips and scorpions. As soon as she came near, with a horrid frown, and
a voice that chilled my very blood, she bade me follow her.
I obeyed, and she led me through rugged paths, beset with
briers and thorns, into a deep solitary valley. Wherever
362
[Lesson 161.she passed, the fading verdure withered beneath her steps;
her pestilential breath infected the air with malignant
vapors, obscured the lustre of the sun, and involved the fair
face of heaven in universal gloom. Dismal howlings resounded through the forest; from every baleful tree, the
night-raven uttered,his dreadful note; and the prospect was
filled with desolation and horror. In the midst of this tremendous scene, my execrable guide addressed me in the
following manner.
"Retire with me, 0 rash, unthinking mortal! from the
vain allurements of a deceitful world; and learn, that pleasure was not designed as the portion of human life. Man
was born to mourn and to be wretched. This is the condition of all below the stars; and whoever endeavors to oppose
it, acts in contradiction to the will of heaven.  Fly then
from the fatal enchantments of youth and social delight, and
here consecrate the solitary hours to lamentation and wo.
Misery is the duty of all sublunary beings; and every
enjoyment is aln offence to the Deity, who is to be worshipped only by the mortification of every sense of pleasure, and
the everlasting exercise of sighs and tears."
This melancholy picture of life quite sunk my spirits,
and seemed to annihilate every principle of joy within me.
I threw myself beneath a blasted yew, where the winds
blew cold and dismal round my head, and dreadful apprehensions chilled my heart. Here I resolved to lie till the
hand of death, which I impatiently invoked, should put an
end to the miseries of a life so deplorably wretched. In
this sad situation I espied on one hand of me a deep muddy
river, whose heavy waves rolled on in slow, sullen mur
murs.  Here I determined to plunge; and was just upon
the brink, when I found myself suddenly drawn back. I
turned about, and was surprised by the sight of the loveliest
object I had ever beheld.  The most engaging charms of
youth and beauty appeared in all her form; effulgent glories
sparkled in her eyes, and their awful splendors were softened
by the gentlest looks of compassion and peace.  At her
approach, the frightful spectre, who had before tormented
me, vanished away, and with her all the horrors she hadc
caused. The gloomy clouds brightened into cheerful sunshine, the groves recovered their verdure, and the whole
region looked gay and blooming as the garden of Eden. I
was quite transported at this unexpected change, and reviving
pleasure began to gladden my thoughts; when, with a look
363
Lesson 161.]
FIRST CLASS BOOK.of inexpressible sweetness, my beauteous deliverer thus uttered
her divine instructions.
"My name is Religion.  I am the offspring of Truth and
Love, and the pirent of Benevolence, Hope, and Joy. That
monster, from whose power I have freed you, is called Superstition: she is the child of Discontent, and her followers
are Fear and  Sorrow.  Thus, different as we are, she
has often the insolence to assume my name and character,
and seduces unhappy mortals to think us the same, till she,
at length, drives them to the borders of Despair, that dreadful abyss into which you were just going to sink.
"Look round, and survey the various beauties of the
globe, which heaven has destined for the seat of the human
race; and consider whether a world thus exquisitely framed,
could be meant for the abode of misery and pain. For what
end has the lavish hand of Providence diffused innumerable
objects of delight, but that all might rejoice in the privilege of existence, and be filled with gratitude to the beneficent Author of it?  Thus to enjoy the blessings he has sent,
is virtue and obedience; and to reject them merely as means
of pleasure, is pitiable ignorance, or absurd perverseness.
Infinite goodness is the source of created existence.  The
proper tendency of every rational being, from the highest
order of raptured seraphs, to the meanest rank of men, is,
to rise incessantly from lower degrees of happiness to higher.
They have faculties assigned them for various orders of
delights."
"What!" cried I, "is this the language of Religion?
Does she lead her votaries through flowery paths, and bid
them pass an unlaborious life? Where are the painful toils
of virtue, the mortifications of penitents, and the self-denying
exercises of saints and heroes?"
" The true enjoyments of a reasonable being," answered
she mildly, "do not consist in unbounded indulgence, or
luxurious ease, in the tumult of passions, the languor of
indulgence, or the flutter of light amusements. Yielding to
immoral pleasures, corrupts the mind; living to animal and
trifling ones, debases it: both, in their degree, disqualify it
for its genuine good, and consign it over to wretchedness.
Whoever would be really happy, must make the diligent
and regular exercise of his superior powers his chief attention; adoring the perfections of his Maker, expressing goodwill to his fellow-creatures, and cultivating inward rectitude.
To his lower faculties he must allow such gratifications as'376 4
TEI AMIERICAN
[Lesson 161.will, by refreshing, invigorate him  for nobler pursuits.  In
the regions inhabited by angelic natures, unmingled felicity
for ever blooms; joy flows there with a perpetual and
abundant stream, nor needs any mound to check its course.
Beings conscious of a frame of mind originally diseased, as
all th- human race has cause to be, must use the regimen
of a stricter self-government.  Whoever has been guilty of
voluntary excesses, must patiently submit both to the painful
workings of nature, and needful severities of medicine, in
order to his cure.  Still he is entitled to a moderate share
of whatever alleviating accommodations this fair mansion
of his merciful Parent affords, consistent with his recovery.
And, in proportion as this recovery advances, the liveliest
joy will spring from  his secret sense of an amended and
imprQved heart.--So far from the horrors of despair is the condition even of the guilty.-Shudder, poor mortal, at the thought
of the gulf into which thou wast just now going to plunge.
"Whilst the most faulty have every encouragement to
amend, the more innocent soul wi;il be supported with still
sweeter consolations under all its experience of human infirmities, supported by the gladdening assurances, that every
sincere endeavor to outgrow them, shall be assisted, accepted,
and rewarded.  To such a one, the lowliest self-abasement
is but a deep-laid foundation for the mnost elevated hopes;
since they who faithfully examine and acknowledge what
they are, shall be enabled, under my conduct, to become
what they desire.  The Christian anld the hero are inseparable; and to the aspirings of unassuming trust and filial
confidence, are set no bounds.  To him  who is animated
with a view of obtaining approbation from the Sovereign
of the universe, no difficulty is insurmountable. Secure,
in this pursuit, of every needful aid, his conflict with the
severest pains and trials, is little more than the vigorous
exercises of a mind in health. His patient dependence on
that Providence which looks through all eternity, his silent
r6signation,* his ready accommodation of his thoughts and
behavior to its inscrutable ways, are at once the most excellent sort of self-denial, and a source of the most exalted
transports.  Society is the true sphere of human virtue.  In
social, active life, difficulties will perpetually be met with;
restraints of many kinds will be necessary; and studying to
behave right in respect of these, is a discipline of the human
heart, useful to others, and improving to it?elf.  Suffering

ing their juices, and constantly, as it should seem, in the act
of sucking. It cannot be doubted but that this is a state of
gratification. What else should fix them so closely to the
operation, and so long?  Other species are running about,
with an alacrity in their motions, which carries with it every
mark of pleasure. Large patches of ground are sometimes
half covered with these brisk and sprightly natures.
If we look to what the waters produce, shoals of the fry
of fish frequent the margins of rivers, of lakes, and of the
sea itself. These are so happy, that they know not what
to do with themselves.  Their attitudes, their vivacity, their
leaps out of the water, their frolics in it, all conduce to
show their excess of spirits, and are simply the effects of
that excess. Walking by the seaside, in a calm evening,
upon a sandy shore, and with an ebbing tide, I have frequently remarked the appearance of a dark cloud, or rather, very
thick mist, hanging over the edge of the water, to the height,
perhaps, of half a yard, and of the breadth of two or three
yards, stretching along the coast as far as the eye could
reach, and always retiring with the water.
When this cloud came to be examined, it proved to be so
much space, filled with young shrimps, in the act of bounding into the air, from the shallow margin of the water, or
from the wet sand. If any motion of a mute animal could
express delight, it was this: if they had meant to make signs
of their happiness, they could not have done it more intelligibly. Suppose, then, what there is no reason to doubt,
each individual of this number to be in a state of positive
enjoyment; what a sum, collectively, of gratification and
pleasure have we here before our view!
The young of all animals appear to receive pleasure simply from the exercise of their limbs and bodily faculties,
without reference to any end to be attained, or any use to
be answered by the exertion.  A child, without knowing any
thing of the use of language, is in a high degree delighted
with being able to speak. Its incessant repetition of a few
articulate sounds, or, perhaps, of a single word which it
has learned to pronounce, proves this point clearly. Nor is
it less pleased with its first successful endeavors to walk,
or rather, to run, (which precedes walking,) although entirely ignorant of the importance of the attainment to its
future life, and even without applying it to any present purpose. A child is delighted with speaking, without having

good; nor pleasure a crime, but where it strengthens the
influence of bad inclinations, or lessens the generous activity
of virtue. The happiness allotted to man in his present state,
is indeed faint and low, compared with his immortal prospects, and noble capacities: but yet whatever portion of
it the distributing hand of heaven offers to each individual,
is a needful support and refreshment -for the present moment, so far as it may not hinder the attaining of his final
destination.
" Return then with me from continual misery, to moderate
enjoyment, and grateful alacrity: return from the contracted
views of solitude, to the proper duties of a relative and
dependent being. Religion is not confined to cells and
closets, nor restrained to sullen retirement. These are the
gloomy doctrines of Superstition, by which she endeavors to
break those chains of benevolence and social affection, that
link the welfare of every particular with that of the whole.
Remember that the greatest honor you can pay the Author
of your being, is a behavior so cheerful as discovers a mind
satisfied with his dispensations."
Here my preceptress paused; and I was going to express
my acknowledgments for her discourse, when a ring of bells
from the neighboring village, and the new risen sun darting
his beams through my windows, awoke me.

The Waterfall.-DERzHAVIN.
Lo! like a glorious pile of diamonds bright,
Built on the steadf'ast cliffs, the waterfall
Pours forth its gems of pearl and silver light:
They sink, they rise, and sparkling, cover all
With infinite refulgence; while its song,
Sublime as thunder, rolls the woods alongRolls through the woods--they send its accents back,

Beneath the forest-shade; then sweetly flows
A milky stream, all silent as it goes.

Listening-not fearful, for he nothing fears:
His red eyes burn like fury-kindled brands,
Like bristles o'er him his coarse fur he rears;
Howling, thy dreadful roar he oft repeats,
And, more ferocious, hastes to bloodier feats.
The wild stag hears thy falling waters' sound,
And tremblingly flies forward-o'er his back

Close to thine awful pile of majesty,

The world's gay scenery and its pageantries;
Which, as delusive as thy shininig wave,
Glow for the proud, the coward and the slave.
So is our little stream of life poured cut
In the wild turbulence of passion: so,
Midst glory's glance and victory's thunder-shout,
The joys of life in hurried exile goTill hope's fair smile, and beauty's ray of light,
Are shrouded in the griefs and storms of night.
Day after day prepares the funeral shroud;
The world is gray with age:-the striking hour
Is but an echo of death's summons loudThe jarring of the dark grave's prison-door:
Into its deep abyss--devouring allKings and the friends of kings alike must fall."

How justly irnaged in this waterfall!
So wild and furious in thy sparkling birth,
Dashing thy torrents down, and dazzling all;
Sublimely breaking from thy glorious height,
Majestic, thundering, beautiful and bright.
How many a wondering eye is turned to thee,
In admiration lost;--shortsighted men!
Thy furious wave gives no fertility;
Thy waters, hurrying fiercely through the plain,

whither to go. And, previously to both these, it is reasonable to believe, that the waking hours of infancy are agreeably taken up with the exercise of vision, or perhaps, more
properly speaking, with learning to see.
But it is not for youth alone that the great Parent of creation has provided. Happiness is found with the purring
cat, no less than with the playful kitten: in the arm-chaiI
of dozing age, as well as in either the sprightliness of the
dance, or the animation of the chace. To novelty, to acuteness of sensation, to hope, to ardor of pursuit, succeeds,
what is, in no inconsiderable degree, an equivalent for them
all, "preception of ease."  Herein is the exact difference
between the young and the old.  The young are not happy,
but when enjoying pleasure; the old are happy, when free
from  pain.  And this constitution suits with the degrees of
animal power which they respectively possess. The vigor
of youth was to be stimulated to action by impatience of
rest; whilst to the imbecility of age, quietness and repose
become positive gratifications. In one important respect
the advantage is with the old. A state of ease is, generally
speaking, more attainable then a state of pleasure.  A constitution, therefore, which can enjoy ease, is preferable to
that which can taste only pleasure.
This same perception of ease oftentimes renders old age
a condition of great comfort; especially when riding at its
anchor, after a busy or tempestuous life. It is well described by Rousseau, to be the interval of repose and enjoyment, between the hurry and the end of life. How far the
same cause extends to other animal natures, cannot be judged of with certainty. The appearance of satisfaction, with
which most animals, as their activity subsides, seek and
enjoy rest, affords reason to believe, that this source of gratification is appointed to advance I life, under all, or most,
of its various forms.
There is a great deal of truth in the following representation given by Dr. Percival, a very pious writer, as well as
excellent man:  "To the intelligent and virtuous, old age
presents a scene of tranquil enjoyments, of obedient appe
tites, of well regulated affections, of maturity in knowledge,
and of calm preparation for immortality.  In this serene and
dignified state, placed, as it were, on the confines of two
worlds, the mind of a good man reviews what is past with the
complacency of an approving conscience; and looks forward,that falletla to me."  And he divided unto them his living.
And, not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there
wasted his substance with riotous living. And, when he
had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land;
and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his
fields to feed swine. And he would fain have filled himself
with the husks that the swine did eat; and no man gave
unto him.
And, when he came to himself, he said, " How many hired
servants of my father's have bread enough, and to spare;and I perish with hunger!-I will arise, and go to my father,
and will say unto him-Father, I have sinned against heaven,
and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy
son:--make me as one of thy hired servants."
And he arose, and was coming to his father:-but, while
he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had
compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
And the son said unto hinm, "Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
called thy son." But the father said to his servants, " Bring
forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his
hand, and shoes on his feet;-and bring hither the fatted calf,
and kill it; and let us eat and be merry:-for this, my son,
was dead, and is alive again;--he was lost, and is found."
Now his elder son was in the field:-and as he came and
drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And
he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
meant. And he said unto him, " Thy brother is come; and
thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received
him safe and sound."
And he was angry;--and would not go in: therefore
came his father out and entreated him. And he, answering,
said to his father, "Lo, these many years have I served
thee, neither transgressed I, at any time, thy commandment;
and yet-thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make
merry with my friends:-But, as soon as this--thy son was
come, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast
killed for him the fatted calf."
And the father said unto him-" Son, thou art ever with
me; and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we
should make merry and be glad: for this-thy brother--was
dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.."LESSON CLXV.

The rich man and the poor man.-KHEMNITZER.

So goes the world;--if wealthy, you may call
This friend, that brother;-friends and brothers all;
Though you are worthless -witless--never mind it;
You may have been a stable boy-what then?'Tis wealth, good Sir, makes honorable men.
You seek respect, no doubt, and you will find it.
But if you are poor, heaven help you! though your sire
Had royal blood within him, and though you
Possess the intellect of angels too,'Tis all in vain;-the world will ne'er inquire
On such a score:--Why should it take the pains?'Tis easier to weigh purses, sure, than brains.
I once saw a poor fellow, keen and clever,
Witty and wise:-he paid a man a visit,
And no one noticed him, and no one ever
Gave him a welcome. " Strange," cried I, "whence is it J"
He walked on this side, then on that,
He tried to introduce a social chat;
Now here, now there, in vain he tried;
Some formally and freezingly replied,
And some
Said by their silence-" Better stay at home."

He could not pride himself upon his wit;
And as for wisdom he had none of it;

-he durst no more take such a license, than a bear by
his beard;--If in our communion, Sir, a man was to insult
an apostle,-a saint,-or even the paring of a saint's nail,
-he would have his eye scratched out.--Vhat, by the saint?
quoth my uncle Toby. No, replied Doctor Slop, he would
have an old house over his head. Pray is the inquisition an
ancient building, answered my uncle Toby; or is it a modern
one?-I know nothing of architecture, replied Doctor Slop.
An't please your honors, quoth Trim, the inquisition is the
vilest-Prithee spare thy description, Trim, I hate the very
name of it, said my father.--No matter for that, answered
Doctor Slop,-it has its uses; for though I'm  no great
advocate for it, yet in such a case as this, he would soon be
taught better mannerz; and I can tell him, if he went on at
that rate, would be flung into the inquisition for his pains.
God help him then, quoth my uncle Toby. Amen, added
Trim; for Heaven above knows, I have a poor brother who
has been fourteen years a captive in it.--I never heard or
word of it before, said my uncle Toby, hastily: How car]
he there Trim?-O, Sir! the story will make your heart
bleed,-as it has made mine a thousand times;-the short of
the story is this;-That my brother Tom went over, a servant,
to Lisbon-and married a Jew's widow, who kept a small
shop and sold sausages, which, some how or other, was the
cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of
his bed, where he was lying with his wife and two small children, and carried directly to the inquisition, where, God help
him, continued Trim, fetching a sigh from the bottom of his
heart,--the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour; he was
as honest a soul, added Trim (pulling out his handkerchief,)
as ever blood warmed.-The tears trickled down Trim's cheeks faster than he
could well wipe them away.-A dead silence in the room
ensued for some minutes. Certain proof of pity! Come,
Trim, quoth mny father, after he saw the poor fellow's grief
had got a little vent,--read on,-and put this melancholy
story out of thy head-I grieve that I interrupted thee: but
prithee begin the sermon again;-for if the first sentence
in it is matter of atuse, as thou sayest, I have a. great desire
to know what kind of provocation the Apostle has given.
Corporal Trim wiped his face, and returned his handkerchief into his pocket, and, making a bow as he did it,-he
began again.]LESSON CLXVIII.
Thle Abuses of Conscience.-A  Sermon.--STERN'E.
Heb. xili. 18.
For we trust we have a good Conscience.
"--TRUST! Trust we have a good conscience!  Surely
if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend
upon, and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indis'putable evidence, it must be this
very thing,--whether he has a good conscience or no."
[I am positive I am right, quoth Dr. Slop.]
"If a man thinks at all, he cannot well be a stranger to
the true state of this account;--he must be privy to his own
thoughts and desires-he must remember his past pursuits,
and know certainly the true springs and motives, which in
general have governed the actions of his life." [I defy him,
without an assistant, quoth Dr. Slop.]
"In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances; and, as the wise man complains, hardly do we guess
aright at the things that are upon the earth, and iwitih labor
do we find the things that are before us.  But here the mind
has all the evidence and facts within herself;-is cons.ious
of the web she has wove;-knows its texture and fineness,
and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has plan.
ned before her."
[The language is good, and I declare Trim  reads very
well, quoth my father.]
" Now,--as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge
which the mind has within herself of this; and the judgment, either of approbation or censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives; it in,
plain, you will say, from the very terms of the proposition,
-whenever this inward testimony goes against a man, and
he stands self-accused,-that he must necessarily be a guilty
man.-And, on the contrary, when the report is favorable
on his side, and his heart condemns him not;--that it is not
a matter of trust, as the apostle intimates, but a matter of
certainty, and the fact that the conscience is good, and that
the man must be good also."
[Then the apostle is altogether in the wrong, I suppose,
quoth Dr. Slop, and the Protestant divine is in the right.
Lesson 165.]
391Sir, have patience, replied my father; for I think it will
presently appear that Saint Pazul and the Protestant divine
are both of an opinion.--As nearly so, quoth Dr. Slop, as
east is to west;--but this, continued he, lifting both hands,
comes from the liberty of the press.
It is no more, at the worst, replied my uncle Toby, than
the liberty of the pulpit, for it does not appear that the sermon is plJnted, or ever likely to be.
Go on Trim, quoth my father.]
"At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the
case; and I make no doubt but the knowledge of right and
wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of man,-that
did no such thing ever happen, as that the conscience of a
man, by long habits of sin, might (as the scriptures assure
us it may) insensibly become hard;-and like some tender
parts of his body, by much stress and continual hard usage,
lose, by degrees, that nice sense and perception with which
God and nature endowed it:--Did this never happen:-or
was it certain that self-love could never hang the least bias
upon the judgment;--or that the little interests below could
rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions, and
encompass them about with clouds and thick darkness:
could no such thing as favor and affection enter this sacred
court:--did wit disdain to take a bribe in it;-or was ashamed to show its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment:-or, lastly, were we assured that interest stood
always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearing,--and that
passion never got into the judgment-seat, and pronounced
sentence in the stead of reason, which is always supposed to
preside and determine upon the case;--was this truly so, as
the objection must suppose;-no doubt then the religious and
moral estate of a man would be exactly what he himself
esteemed it;--and the guilt or innocence of every man's life
could be known, in general, by no better measure, than the
degrees of his own approbation and censure.
"I own, in one case, wNhenever a man's conscience does
accuse him (as it seldom errs on that side) that he is guilty;
and unless, in melancholy and hypochondriac cases, we
may safely pronounce upon it, that there is always sufficieni
grounds for the accusation.
" But the converse of the proposition will not hold true,
-namely, that whenever there is guilt, the conscience must
accuse: and if it does not, that a man is therefore innocent.
-This is not fact--So that the common consolation which
3582
[Lesson 168.
THE AMIERICANsome good Christian or other is hourly administering to
hirnself,-that he thanks God his mind does not misgive
him; and that, consequently, he has a good conscience, because he has a quiet one,-is fallacious;--and as current as
the inference is, and as infallible as the rule appears at
first sight; yet when you look nearer to it, and try the truth
cf this rule upon plain facts,-you see it liable to so much
error from a false application;-the principle upon which
it goes so often prevented;--the whole force of it lost,
and sometimes so vilely cast away, that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life, which confirm
the account.
"A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his
principles;-exceptionable  in his conduct to the world;
shall live shameless, in the open commission of a sin, which
no reason or pretence can justify,-a sin by which, contrary
to all the worlkings of humanity, he shall ruin for ever the
deluded partner of his guilt;-2rob her of her best dowry
and not only cover her own head with dishonor,-but involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her
sake. Surely, you will think conscience must lead such a
man a troublesome life;--he can have no rest night or day
from its reproaches.
"Alas! Conscience had something else to do all this time,,han breakl in zupon him; as Eli'jah reproached the god
Baa7,- this domrestic god was either talZking, or pursuing, or
was in a journey, or peradventure,ie slept and could inot be
awaked.  Perhaps he wvas going out in company with Honor
to fight a duel; to pay off some debt at play;--or perhaps
Conscience all this time was engaged at home, talking aloud
against petty larceny, and executing vengeance upon some
such puny crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured
hinm against all temptation of committing; so that he lives
as merrily,"-[If he was of our church, though, quoth Dr.
Slop, he could no']--" sieeps as soundly in his bed; and at

than a much better rrman."

he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments.*Pray, how many have you in all? said my uncle Toby,--
for I always forget.-Seven, answered Dr. Slop.-Hurrph!
-said uncle Toby; though not accented as a note of acqui*
escence,--but as an interjection of that particular species of
surprise, when a man, in looking into a drawer, finds more
than he expected.--Humph! replied my uncle Toby.-Dr.
Slop, who had an ear, understood my uncle Toby as well as
if he had written a whole volume against the seven sacraments.-IIumph! replied Dr. Slop (stating my uncle Toby's
argument over again to him)--Why, Sir, are there not seven
cardinal virtues?-Seven mortal sins?-Seven golden candlesticks-Seven heavens?-'Tis more than I know, replied
my uncle Toby.-Are there not seven wonders of the world?
-Seven days of the creation?-Seven planets?-Seven
plagues?-That there are, quoth my father with a most affected gravity. But prithee, continued he, go on with the
rest of thy characters, Trim.]
"Another is sordid, unmerciful," (here Trim  waved his
right hand) " a strait-hearted, selfish wretch, incapable eithee
of private friendship, or public spirit.  Take notice how he
passes by the widow and orphan in their distress, and sees
all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a
prayer."  [An't please your honors, cried Trim, I think this
a viler man than the other.]
" Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions?-No; thank God, there is no occasion.  Ipay every
man his own; I have no debaucheries to answer to my conscience;
-no faithless vows or promises to make up;-I have dishonored no man's wife or child;--thank God, I am not as other
vmen, adulterers, unjust, or even as this libertine, who stands before vme. A third is crafty and designing in his nature. View
his whole life,-it is nothing but a cunning contexture of
dark arts and unequitable subterfuges, basely to defeat the
true intent of all laws,-plain dealing, and the safe enjoyment of our several properties.--You will see such a one
working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance
and perplexities of the poor and needy man,--and raising a
fortune upon the inexperience of a youth, or the unsuspecting temper of l,is friend, who would have trusted him with
his life.  When old age comes on, and repentance calls

or prison opening its gates upon him:-What is there to affright his conscience!-Conscience has got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law, sits there invulnerable,
fortified with Cases and Reports so strongly on all sides;that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold."
[The character of this last man, said Dr. Slop, interrupting Trim, is more detestable than all the rest;-and seems
to have been taken from some pettifogging lawver amongst
you:-amongst us, a man's conscience could not possibly
continue so long blinded,-three times a year, at least, he
must go to confession.  Will that restore it to sight? quoth
my uncle Toby-Go on, Trim, quoth my father.'Tis very
short, replied Trim.-I wish it was longer, quoth my uncle
Toby, for I like it hugely.-- Trim went on.]
" To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in our
mutual dealings with each other, to govern our actions by
the eternal measures of right and wrong:-The first of these
will comprehend the duties of religion,-the second those
of morality, which are so inseparably connected together
that you cannot divide these two tables, even in irnagination,
(though the attempt is oftenl made in practice,) without breaking and mutually destroying them both.
[Here my father observed that Dr. Slop was fast asleep.]
" I said the attempt was often made;-and so it is;-there
being nothing more comm( a than to see a man who has
no sense at all of religion, and, indeed, has so much honesty
as to pretend to none, who would take it as the bitterest affront,
should you but hint at a suspicion on his moral character, or
imagine he wvas not conscientiously just and scrupulous to
the uttermost mite.
" When there is some appearance that it is so,-though one
is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a
virtue as moral honesty, yet were we to look into the groulnds
of it, in the present case, I am persuaded we should find
little reason to envy such a one the honor of his motive.
" Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the
subject, it will be found to rest upon no better foundation
than either his interest, his pride, his ease, or some such
little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great distress.

to call in any physician in this case.]

hear them  make a jest of it every day, and treat all its
sanctions with so much scorn as to put the matter past
doubt. Well, notwithstanding this, I put my fortune into'
the hands of the one;-and, what is dearer still to me, I
trust my life to the honest skill of the other.
" Now let me examine what is my reason for this great
confidence. Why, in the first place, I believe there is no
probability that either of them will employ the power I put
into their hands to nvy disadvantage.-I consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life;-I know their success
in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters.
In a word, I am persuaded that they carlnot hurt me, without hurting themselves more.
" But put it otherwise; namely, that interest lay, for once,
on the other side:-that a case should happen wherein the
one, without stain to his reputation, could secrete my fortune, and leave me naked in the world;-or that the other
could send me out of it, and enjoy an estate by my death,
without dishonor to himself or his art:--In this case, what
hold have I of either of them!--Religion, the strongest of
all motives, is out of the question;--Interest, the next most
powerful motive in the world, is strongly against me:WVhat have I left to cast into the opposite scale to balance
this temptation?-Alas! I have nothing,-but what is lighter
than a bubble-I must lie at the mercy of Honor, or some
such capricious principle-Strait security for two of the
most valuable blessings!   my property and myself.
" As therefore we can have no dependence upon morality
without religion,-so, on the other hand, there is nothing
better to be expected from religion without morality;nevertheless,'tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral

LESSON  CLXXI.
Some account of the character and merits of John Playfair,
Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of
Edinburgh.-JE FFREY.
IT has struck many people, we believe, as very extraordinary, that so eminent a person as Mr. Playfair should have
been allowed to sink into his grave in the midst of us, without calling forth almost so much:as an attempt to commemorate his merit, even in a commonf newspaper; ard that the
death of a man so celebrated and beloved, and at the same
time so closely connected with many who could well appreciate and suitably describe his excellencies, should be left
to the brief and ordinary notice of the daily obituary. No
event of the kind certainly ever excited more general sympathy; and no individual, we are persuaded, will be longer
or more affectionately remembered by all the classes of his
fellow-citizens: and yet it is to these very circumstances
that we must look for an explanation of the app~trent neglect with which his memory has been followed.
We beg leave to assure our readers, that it is merely
from an anxiety to do something to gratify this natural imLTesson 171.]
391patience, tha.t we presume to enter at all upon a subject, to
which we are perfectly aware thatwe are incapable of doing
justice.  For, of Mr. Playfair's scientific attainments-of
his proficiency in those studies to which he was peculiarly
devoted, we are but slenderly qualified to judge; but, we believe, we hazard nothing in sayinog that he was one of the
most learned mathematicians of his age, and among the first
if not the very first, who introduced the beautiful discoveries
of the later continental geometers to the knowledge of his
countrymen, and gave their just and true place, in the scheme
of Europe'an knowledge, to those important improvements by
which the whole aspect cf the abstract sciences has been renovated since the days of our illustrious Newton.
If he did not signalize himself by any brilliant or original
invention, he must at least be allowed to have been a most
generous and intelligent judge of the achievernents of others,
as well as the most eloquent expounder of that great and
magnificent system of knowledge which has been gradually
evolved by the successive labors of so many gifted individuals. He possessed, indeed, in the highest degree, all the
ch'aracteris'tics both of a fi.ne and powerful undertanding
e    -at once penetrating and vigilant--but more distinguished,
perhaps, for the caution and sureness of its march, than for
the brilliancy or rapidity of its movements-and guided and
adorned through all its pr6gress by the most genuine enthusiasm for all that is grand, and the justest taste for all that
is beautiful, in the yuth or the intellectual energy with
which he was habituSilly conversant.
Mr. Playfair wair not merely a teacher; and has fortunately left behind him a variety of works, from which other generations may be enabled to judge of some of those qualifications which so powerfully recommended and endeared him
to his contemporaries.  It is, perhaps, to be regretted that so
much of his time, and so large a proportion of his publications, should have been devoted to the subjects of the Indian
Astronomy, and the Huttonian Theory of the Earth.  For
though nothing can be more beautiful or instructive than his
speculations on those curious topics, it cannot be dissembled
that their results are less conclusive and satisfactory than
might have been desired; and that Ihis doctrines, from the
very nature of their subjects, are more questionable than we
believe they could possibly have been on ally other topic in
the whole circle of the sciences.
A juster estimate of Mr. Playfair's talent, and a truer pic392
[Lesson 171.
THE AiIERICANture of his genius and understanding, is to be found in his
other writings; in the papers, both biographical and scientific, with which he has enriched the transactions of our
Royal Society;--his account of De Laplace, and other articles which he is said to have contributed to the Edinburgh
Review-vthe Outlines of his Lect-ures on Natural Philosophy-and, above all, his Introductory Discourse to the Supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, with the final cor
rection of which he was occupied up to the last moments
that the progress of his disease allowed him to dedicate to
any intellectual exertion.
With reference to these works, we do not think we are
influenced by any national, or other partiality, when we say
that he was certainly one of the best writers of his age; and
even that we do not now recollect any one of his contemporaries who was so great a master of conlposition.  There
is a certain mellowness and richness about his style, which
adorns, without disguising the weight and nervousness, which
is its other great chAracteris'tic-a sedate gracefulness and
manly simplicity in the more level passages-and a mild
majesty and considerate enthusiasm where he rises above
them, of which we scarcely know where to find any other
example.
There is great equability, too, and sustained force, in
every part of his writings. He never exhausts himself in
flashes and epigrams, nor languishes into tameness or insipidity; at first sight you would say, that plainness and good
sense were the predominating qualities; but, by the by, this
simplicity is enriched with the delicate and vivid colors of
a fine imagination-the free and forcible touches of a powerful intellect-and the lights and shades of an unerring, harmonizing taste. In comparinc it with the styles of his most
celebrated contemporaries, we would say that it was more
purely and peculiarly a written style-and, therefore, rejected those ornaments that more properly belong to oratory.
It hlad no impetuosity, hurry, or ve'hemence-no bursts,
or sudden turns, or abruptness, like that of Burke; and
though eminently smooth and melodious, it was not modulated to a uniform system of solemn declamation, like that
of Johnson, nor spread out in the richer and more voluminous elocution of Stewart; nor still less broken into that
patch-work of scholastic pedantry and conversational smartn ess which has found its admirers in Gibbon.  It is a style,
in short, of great freedom, force, and beauty; but the delibeLcsso?i 171.]
393rate style of a man of thought and of learning; and neither
that of a wit, throwing out his extempores with an affectation of careless grace--nor of a rhetoriclan, thinking more
of his manner than his matter, and determined to be admired for his express;on, whatever may be the fate of his sentiments.
But we need dwell no longer on qualities that may be
gathered hereafter from  the works he has left behlind hlim.
-They who lived with him mourn the most for those which
will be traced in no such memorial; and prize, far above
these talents which gained him his high name in philosophy,
that personal character which endeared him  to his friends,
and shed a grace and a dignity over all the society in which
he moved.  The same ad'mirable taste which is conspicuous
in his writings, or rather, the higher principles from which
that taste was but an emanation, spread a similar charm over
his whole life and conversation; and gave to the most learned philosopher of his day, the manners and deportminent of
the most perfect gentleman.
Nor was this in him the result merely of good sense and
good temper, assisted by an early familiarity with good companv, and a consequent knowledge of his own place and that
of all around him.  His good breeding was of a higher descent; and his powers of pleasing rested on something better than mere companionable qualities.  With the greatest
kindness and generosity of nature, he united the most manly
fir,nness, and the highest principles of honor; and the most
cheerful and social dispositions, with the gentlest and steadiest affections.
Towards women he had always the most chivalrous* feelings of regard and attention, and was, beyond almost all
men, ac'ceptable and agreeable in their society-though
withoult the least levity or pretension unbecoming his age or
condition.  And such, indeed, was the fascination of the
perfect simplicity and mildness of his manners, that the
same tone or deportment seemed equally appropriate to all
societies, and enabled him to delight the young and the gay'with the samne sort of conversation which instructed the
learned and the grave. There never, indeed, was a man of
learning and talent who appeared in society so perfectly free
from every sort of pretension or notion of his own importance, or so little solicitous to distinguish himself, or so sincerely willing to give place to every one else.
Even upon subjects which he had thoroughly studied, he
394
TIIE AMERICAN
[LIesson 171.was never in the least impatient to speak, and spoke at all
times without any tone of authority; while, so far from
wishing to set off what he had to say by any brilliancy or
emphasis of expression, it seemed generally as if he had
tried to disguise the weight and originality of his thoughts
under the plainest form of speech, and. the most quitt and
indifferent manner; so that the profoundest remarks and
subtlest observations were often dropped, not only without
any solicitude that their value should be observed, but without any appa'rent consciousness that they possessed any.
Though the most social of human beings, and the most
disposed to encourage and sympathize with the gayety of
others, his own spirits were in general rather cheerful than
gay, or at least never rose to any turbulence or tumult of
merriment: and whi!le he would listen with the kindest indulgence to the more extravagant sallies of his younger
friends, and prompt them by the heartiest approbation, his
own satisfaction might generally be traced in a slow and
temperate smile, gradually mantling over his benevolent and
intelligent features, and lighting up the countenance of the
sage with the expression of the mildest and most gentle
philanthropy.
It was wonderful, indeed, considering the measure of his
own intellect, and the rigid and undeviating propriety of his
own conduct, how tolerant he was of the errors and defects
of other men.  He was too indulgent, in truth, and favorable to his friends-and made a kind and liberal allowance
for the faults of all mankind-except only faults of baseness
or of cruelty-against which he never failed to manifest the
most open scorn and d6testa'tion.  Independent, in short, of
his high  attainments, Mr. Playfair was one of the most
amiable and estimable of men. Delightful in his manners
-inflexible in his principles-and generous in his affections,
he had all that could charm in society, or attach in private:
and while his friends enjoyed the free and unstudied conversation of an easy and intelligent associate, they had at all
times the proud and inward assurance that he was a being
upon whose perfect honor and generosity they might rely
with the most implicit confidence, in life and in death,--and
of whom. it was equally impossible, that, under any circumstances, he should ever perform a mean, a selfish, or a questionable action, as that his body should cease to gravitate, or
his soul to live!
If we do not greatly deceive ourselves, there is nothing

Damon, to do a piece of justice, by rescuing him from a danger which he incurred out of generosity to me.
Diony. And thou, Damon, wert thou not really afraid
that Pythias would never come back, and that thou shouldst
have to pay for him?
Damon. I knew but too well that Pythias would return
runctually, and that he would be much more afraid to
break his word, than to lose his life; would to the gods that
h.s relations and friends had forcibly detained him; so he
would now be the comfort of good men, and I should have
that of dying for him.
Diony. What! does life displease thee?
Damon. Yes; it displeases me when I see a tyrant.
Diony. Well, thou shalt see him no more: I'll have thee
put to death immediately.
Pyth. Pardon the transports of a man who regrets his
dying friend. But remember, that it was I only thou devotedst to death: I come to suffer it, in order to redeem my
friend: refuse me not this consolation in my last hour.
Diony. I cannot bear two men who despise their lives
and my power.
Damon. Then thou canst not bear virtue.
Diony. No: I cannot bear that proud disdainful virtue,
which contemns life, which dreads no punishment, which
is not sensible to riches and pleasures.
Damon. However, thou seest that it is not insensible to
honor, justice, and friendship.
Diony. Guards! take Pythias away to execution: we
shall see whether Darnon will continue to despise my
power.
Damon. Pythias, by returning to submit himself to thy
pleasure has merited his life at thy hand; and I, by giving
myself up to thy indignation for him, have enraged thee:
be content, and put me to death.
Pyth. No, no, Dionysius, remember that it was I alone
who displeased thee: Damon could notDiony. Alas! what do I see?  Where am I?  How unnappy am I, and how worthy to be so! No, I have hitherto known nothing: I have spent my days in darkness and
error: all my power avails me nothing towards making myself beloved: I cannot boast of having acquired, in above
thirty years of tyranny, one single friend upon earth: these
two men, in a private condition, love each other tenderly,here of exaggeration or private feeling--and nothing with
which an indifferent and honest chronicler would not concur.
Nor is it altogether idle to have dwelt so long on the personal character of this distinguished individual; for we are
ourselves persuaded, that this personal character has almost
done as much for the cause of science and philosophy among
us, as the great talents and attainments with which it was
combined-and has contrib'uted, in a very eminent degree,
to give to the better society in which he moved, that tone
of intelligence and liberality by which it is honorably distinguished.
It is not a little advantageous to philosophy that it is in
fashion-and it is still more advantageous, perhaps, to the
society which is led to confer on it this apparently trivial
distinction. It is a great thing for the country at large-for
its happiness, its prosperity, and its renown-that the upper
and influencing part of its population should be made familiar, even in its untasked and social hours, with sound and
liberal information, and be taught to respect those who have
distinguished themselves by intellectual attainments.  Nor
is it, after all, a slight or despicable reward for a man of
genius to be received with honor in the highest and most
elegant society around him, and to receive in his living person that homage and applause which is too often reserved for
his memory.

the Jews from their captivity in that city.

CHIAP. XIII. 1 THE ORACLE CONCERNING BABYLON WHICH WAS
REVEALED TO ISAIAH, THE SON OF A1MOTS.
2   UPON a lofty mountain erect the standard;
Exalt the voice; beckon with the hand;
That they may enter the gates of princes.
3 I have given a charge to my enrolled warriors;
I have even called my strong ones to execute my wrath;
Those that exult in my greatness.
4 A sound of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great
people;
A sound of the tumult of kingdoms, of nations gathered
together!
Jehovah, God of Hosts, mustereth the host for the battle.
5 They come from a distant land, from  the end of the
heavens;
Jehovah, and the instruments of his wrath, to destroy the
whole land.
6 Howl ye, for the day of Jehovah is at hand:
As a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
7 Therefore shall all hands be slackened;
And every heart of mortal shall melt; and they shall be
terrified:
8 Torments and pangs shall seize them;
L'hey shall look one upon another with astonishment:
Their countenances shall be like flames of fire.
9 Blehold, the day of Jehovah cometh, inex'orable;

401Even indignation, and burning wrath:
To make the land a desolation;
And her sinners he shall destroy from out of her.
10 Yea, the stars of heaven, and the constellations thereof,
Shall not send forth their light:
The sun is darkened at his going forth,
And the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
11 And I will visit the world for its evil,
And the wicked for their iniquity:
And I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud;
And I will bring down the haughtiness of the terrible
12 I will make a mortal more precious than fine golQ,
Yea a man, than the rich ore of Ophir.
13 WNherefore I will make the heavens tremble:
And the earth shall be shaken out of her place:
In the indignation of Jehovah God of Hosts;
And in the day of his burning anger.
14 And the remnant shall be as a roe chased;
And as sheep, when there is none to gather them to;
gether;
They shall look, every one towards his own people;
And they shall flee, every one to his own land.
15 Every one, that is overtaken, shall be thrust through:
And all that are collected in a body shall fall by the
sword.
17   Behold, I raise up against them the Medes;
Who shall hold silver of no account;
And as for gold, they shall not delight in it.
18S Their bows shall dash the young men;
Their eye shall have no:pity even on the children.
19 And Babylon shall become-she that was the beauty o'
kingdoms,
The glory of the pride of the ChaldeansAs the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah by the han
of God.
20 It shall not be inhabited for ever;
Nor shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation:
Neither shall the Arabian pitch his tent there:
Neither shall the shepherds make their folds there,
But there shall the wild beasts of the deserts lodge
And howlingo monsters shall fill their houses:
And there shall the daughters of the ostrich dwel.
And there shall the satyrs hold their revels.

And will yet choose Israel.
And he shall give them rest upon their own land:
And the stranger shall be joined unto them,
And shall cleave unto the house of Jacob.
2 And the nations shall take them, and bring them  into
their own place;
And the house of Israel shall possess them in the land
of Jehovah,
As servants, and as handmaids:
And they shall take them captive, whose captives they
were;
And they shall rule over their oppressors.
2   And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah shall
give thee rest from thine affliction, and from thy disquiet,
4 and from the hard servitude, which was laid upon thee:
and thou shalt pronounce this parable upon the king of
Babylon; and shalt say:
HOW   hath the oppressor ceased! the exactress of
gold ceased!
5 Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, the sceptre
of the rulers.
6 He that smote the peoples in wrath, with a stroke unremitted:
He that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and
none hindereth.

of the earth;
He iraketh to rise up from their thrones all the kings of
the nations.
10 All of themn shall accost thee, and shall say unto thee:
Art thou, even thou too, become weak  as we? art thou
made like unto us?
11 Is ti]en thy pride broulght down to the grave; the sound
of thy sprigh.tly instruments?
Is the vermin become thy couch, and the eartl-wornm th3
covering?
12 How art thou fallen from  heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the
morning!
Art cut dowxv to the earth, thou that didst subdue the
nations!
13 Yet thou didst say in thy heart: I will ascend the
heavens;
Above the stars of God I winl exalt my throne;
And I will sit upon the mount of the divine presence, on
the sides of the north:
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be
like the Most High.
15 But thou shalt be brought down to the grave, to the sides
of the pit.
16 Those that see thee shall look attentively at thee; they
shall well consider thee:
Is this the man, that made the earth to tremble; that
shook the kingdoms?
17 That made the world like a desert; that destroyed the
cities?
That never dismissed his captives to their own home?
18 All the kings of the nations, all of them,
Lie down in glory, each in his own sepulchre:
" about which," says Dr. Campbell, " the most prying eye and listening ear
could gain no information;" a mransion of rest into which the good and the evil
descended alike, at their death;-the former, indeed, in peace and a good old
age, crowned with virtue and honor;-and the latter hurried thither by their
vices before their time;-a state in which all contiinued a conscious but inactive existence; and where each retained something of the rank and station
wlhich he had held in life.  Hence, the departed spirits of other kings are
represented, in this verse, as rising up from their shadowy thrones, tc
salute with bitter exultations, the king of Babylon, who had now been brought
down as low as themselves.
It will be observed that, here, the prophet, in the bold metaphor of Oriental
poetry, personifies Hades, in giving to this region of silence and darkness, the
attrilbutes of a stern Ruler over the abode and the spirits of the Jead19 But thou art cast out of the grave, as the tree abominated;*
Clothed with the slain, with the pierced by the sword,
With them that go down to the stones of the pit; as a
trodden carcass.
20 Thou shalt not be joined unto them in burial;
Because thou hast destroved thy country, thou hast slain
thy people.
The seed of evil doers shall never be renowned.
21 Prepare ye slaughter for his children, for the iniquity of
their fathers;
Lest they rise, and possess the earth; and fill the face of
the world with cities.
22 For I will arise against them, saith Jehovah God of Hosts:
And I will cut off from Babylon the name, and the remnant;
And the son, and the son's son, saith Jehovah.
23 And I will make it an inheritance for the porcupine, and
pools of water;
And I will plunge it in the miry gulf of destruction,
saith Jehovah God of Hosts.
24 Jehovah God of Hosts hath sworn, saying:
Surely as I have devised, so shall it be;
And as I have pur'posed, that thing shall stand:
25 To crush the Assyrian in my land, and to trample him
on my mountains.
Then shall his yoke depart from off them;
And his burthen shall be removed from off their shoulder.
26 This is the decree, which is determined on the whole
earth;
And this is the hand, which is stretched out over all the
nations:
27 For Jehovah God of Hosts hath decreed; and who shall
disannul it?
And it is his hand, that is stretched out; and who shall
turn it back?
* That is, as an abomination and detesta'tion; such as the tree is, on which
a malefactor has been halnged. " It is written," saith Saint Paul, Gala. iii. 13,
"cursed is every man that hangeth on a tree:" from Deut. xxi. 23. The Jews
therefore held also as accursed and polluted the tree itself on which a malefactor had been executed, or on which he had been hanged after having been
put to death by stoning.                               Lowth.,esson 175.]

Lochiel's Warning.--C CAMPBELL.
Lochiicl was the chief of the warlile clan of the Camerons; and one ot
the most prominent, in respect to power and influence, among the Highland
chieftains. He attached himself to the cause of Charles Stuart, called the
Pretender, froin the claim that he mrade to the British throne. Inr the following piece, Lochiel is supposed to be marching, with the warriors of his clan,
to Join the standard which Charles had raised among the HIighlands in his
invasion of Scotland in 1745. On his way lie is met by a Seer or Wizard,
who, having, according to the popular superstition, the gift of second sight,
or prophecy, forewarns him of the disastrous even_t of the Pretender's enterprise, and exhorts him to return honle, and not be involed in the certain destruction that awaited the cause and the fillowcrs of Charles, and which
afterwards fell upon them in the battle of Cul'oden.
Seer, Lochiel.
Seer. LOCIIIEL! Lochiel, beware of the day
When the Lowlands shall meet thee in battle array!
For a field of the dead rushes red on my sight,
And the clans of Culloden are scattered in fight:
They rally, they bleed, for their kingdom  and crown;
Wo, wo to the riders that trample them down!
Proud Cumberland prances, insulting the slain,
And their hoof-beaten bosoms are trod to the plain.
But hark! throiugh the fast-flashing lightning of war,
What steed to the desert flies frantic and far?'Tis thine, oh G-lenullin! whose bride shall await,
Like a love-lighted watch-fire, all night at the gate.
A steed comes at morning: no rider is there;
But its bridle is red with the sign of despair.
Weep, Albin!* to death and captivity led!
Oh weep! but thy tears cannot number the dead:
For a merciless sword on Culloden shall wave,
Culloden! that reeks with the blood of the brave.
Lochiel. Go, preach to the coward, thou death-telling seer i
Or, if gory Culloden so dreadful appear,
Draw, d5tard, around thy old wavering sigbt,
This mantle, to cover the phantoms of fright.
Seer. Ha! laugh'st thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn t
Proud bird of the mountain, thy plume shall be torn:
* The Gaelic appellation of Scotlaied, more particularly the lgaLnuds,.

[Lesson 176.Say, rushed the bold eagle exultingly forth.
From his holne, in the dark rolling clouds of the north?
Lo! the death-shot of foemen outspeeding, he rode
Companionless, bearing destruction abroad;
But down let him stoop from his havoc on high!
Ah! home let him speed-for the spoiler is nigh.
Why flames the far summit? Why shoot to the blast
Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?'Tis the fire-shower of ruin, all dreadfully driven
From his eyrie* that beacons the darkness of heaven.
Oh, crested Lochiel! the peerless in might,
Whose banners arise on the battlements' height,
Heaven's fire is around thee, to blast and to burn;
Return to thy dwelling! all lonely return!
For the blackness of ashes shall mark where it stood,
And a wild mother scream o'er her famishing brood.
Lochiel. False Wizard, avaunt! I have marshalled my clan.
Their swords are a thousand, their bosoms are one!
They are true to the last of their blood cnd their breath,
And like reapers descend to the harvest of death.
Then welcome be Cumberland's steed to the shock!
Let him dash his proud foam like a wave on the rock.
But wo to his kindred, and wo to his cause,
WVhen Albin her claymore indignantly draws;
When her bonnetted chieftains to victory crowd,
Clan-Ranald the dauntless, and Moray the proud;
All plaided and plumed in their tartan array---
Seer. ----Lochiel, Lochiel, beware of the day!
For, dark and despairing, my sight I may seal,
But man cannot cover what God would reveal:'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,
And coming events cast their shadows before.
I tell thee, Culloden's dread echoes shall rings
With the blood-hounds, that bark for thy fugitive king.
Lo! anointed by heaven with the vials of wrath,
Behold, where he flies on his desolate path!
Now, in darkness and billows, he sweeps from my sight:t
Rise! rise! ye wild tempests, and cover his flight!'Tis finished.  Their thunders are hushed on the moors;
Culloden is lost, and my country deplores;
Buat where is the iron-bound prisoner? Where?
For the red eye of battle is shut in despair.
*Pron. i'r8. tAlluding to the perilous escape of Clharles from the west
of Scotland.
Lesson 176.]
407Say, mounts he the ocean-wave, lbanished, forlorn,
Like a limb from his country cast bleeding and torn?
Ah no! for a darker departure is near;
The war-drum is muffled, and black is the bier;
His death-bell is tolling; oh! mercy, dispel
Yon sight, that it freezes my spirit to tell!
Life flutters convulsed in his quivering limbs,
And his blood-streaming nostril in angony swims.
Accursed be the faggots, that blaze at his feet,
Where his heart shall be thrown, ere it ceases to beat,
With the smoke of its ashes to poison the gale
Lociel.----Down, soothless insulter! I trust not the tale,
Though my perishing ranks should be strewed* in their gore,
Like ocean-weeds heaped on the surf-beaten shore,
Lochiel, untainted by flight or by chains,
While the kindling of life in his bosom remains,
Shall victor exult, or in death be laid low,
With his back to the field, and his feet to the foe!
And leaving in battle no blot on his name,
Look proudly to heaven from the death-bed of fame.

The Poet and the Alchymist.-NEW MONTIILY MAGAZINS
AUTHORS of modern date are wealthy fellows;-'Tis but to snip his locks they follow
Now the golden-haired Apollo.Invoking Plutus to puff up the bellows
Of inspiration, they distil
The rhymes and novels which cajole us,
Not from the Heliconian rill,
But from the waters of Pactolus.
Befare this golden age of writers,
A Grub-street Garreteer existed,
One of the regular inditers
Of odes and poems to be twisted
Into encomiastic verses,
For patrons who have heavy purses.Besides the Bellman's rhymes, he had
Others to let, both gay and sad,
All ticketed from A to Izzard;
And, living by his wits, I need not add,
The rogue was lean as any lizzard.

[Lesson 177.
TIEE AMIERICANLike a ropemaker's were his ways;
For still one line upon another
He spun, and like his hempen brother,
Kept going backwards all his days.
Hard by his attic lived a Chymist,
Or Alchymist, who had a mighllty
Faith in the Elix'ir Vitae;
And though unflattered by the dimmest
Glimpse of success, he still kept groping
And grubbing in his dark vocation,
Stupidly hoping,
To find the art of changing metals,
And guineas coin from pans and kettles,
By mystery of transmutation.
Our starving Poet took occasion
To seek this conjuror's abode,
Not with encomiastic ode,
Or laiudatory dedication,
But with an offer to impart,
For twenty pounds the secret art,
lVhich should procure, without the pain
Of metals, chymistry, and fire,
What he so long had sought in vain,
And gratify his heart's desire.
The money paid, our bard was hurried
To the philosopher's sanctorum,
WVho, somewhat sublimized and flurried,
Out of his chymnical decorum,
Crowed, capered, giggled, seemed to spurn his
Crucibles, retort, and furnace,
And cried as he secured the door,
And carefully put to the shutter,
"Now, now, the secret I implore;
Out with it-spealc-discover-utter!"
With grave and solemn look, the poet
Cried--" List-O, list! for thus I shew it:Let this plain truth those ingrates strile,
WVho still, though bless'd, new blessings crave,
That we may all have what we like,
Simply by liking what we have."

Extract from a dialogue between a Satiric Poet and lis
Friend.-PoPE.
Friend.'Tis all a libel, Paxton, Sir, will say:Poet. Not yet, my friend! to-morrow, faith, it may;
And for that very cause I print to-day.
How should I fret to mangle every line,
In reverence to the sins of thirty-nine!
Vice, with such giant strides, comes on amain,
Invention strives to be before in vain;
Feign what I will, and paint it e'er so strong
Some rising genius sins up to my song.
F. Yet none but you by name the guilty lash;
Even Guthry saves half Newgate by a dash.
Spare then the person, and expose the vice.
P. How! not condemn the sharper, but the dice!
C Nme on then, Satire! general, unconfired,
Spl.ad. thy broad wing, and souse on all the kind.
Ye statesmen, priests, of one religion all!
Ye tradesmen, vile, in army, court, or hall!
Ye reverend atheists!-F. Scandal! name them, -who?
P. Why that's the thing you bid me not to do.
Who starved a sister,--who forswore a debt
I never named; the town's inquiring yet.
The poisoning dame-F. You mean-P. I don't--F. You do
P. See, now, I keep the secret, and not you!
The bribing statesnlan-F. Hold! too highl you go.
P. The bribed elector-F. There you stoop too low.
P. I fain would please you if I knew with what;
Tell me, which knave is laWvful game, which not?
Must great offenders, once escaped the crown,
Like royal harts, be never more run down?
Admit yourlaw to spare the knight requires,
As beasts of nature may we hunt the squires?
Suppose I censure-you know what I meanTo save a bishop, may I name a dean?
F. A dean, Sir? no; his fortune is not Imade,
You hurt a man that's rising in the trade.
P. If not the tradesman who set up to-day,
Much less the prentice who to-morrow may.
Down, down, proud Satire! though a realm be spoiled,
Arraign no mightier thief than wretched Wild.
410
[Lesson 178.Or, if a court, or country's made a job,
Go, drench a pickpocket, and join the mob.
But, Sir, I beg you, (for the love of Vice!)
The imatter's weighty, pray consider twice;
Have you less pity for the needy cheat,
The poor and friendless villain, than the great?
Alas! the small discredit of a bribe
Scarce hurts the lawyer, but undoes the scribe.
Then better, sure, it charity becomes
To tax directors, who (thank God) have plums;
Still better ministers; or, if the thing
May pinch even there-why lay it on a king.
F. Stop! Stop!-P.:Must Satire, then, nor risc, nor fall?
Speak out, and bid me blame no rogues at all.
F. Yes, strike that Wild, I'll justify the blow.
P. Strike?--Why the man was hanged ten years ago.
WTho now that obsolete example fears?
Even Peter trembles only for his ears.
F. What, always Peter? Peter thinks you mad:You make men desperate, if they once are bad.
But why so few comnmended?-P. Not so fierceYou find the virtue, and I'll find the verse.
But random praise-the task can ne'er be done;
Each mother aslis it for her booby son,
Each widow asks it for the best of men,
For him she weeps, for him she weds again.
Praise cannot stoop, like Satire, to the ground;
The number may be hanged, but not be crowned.
No power the Muse's friendship can command,
No power, when Virtue claims it, can withstand.
-What are you thinking?-F. Faith, the thought's no sin,
I think your friends are out, and would be in.
P. If merely to come in, Sir, they go out,
The way they take is strangely round about.
F. They, too, may be corrupted, you'll allow?
P. I only call those knaves who are so now.
Is that too little?--Comne, then, I'll comply -
Spirit of Arnal! aid me while I lie.
Cobham's a. coward, Polwarth is a slave,
And Lyttleton, a dark, designing knave.
St. John has ever been a mighty foolBut, let me add, Sir Robert's mighty dull,
Has never made a friend in private life,
And was, besides, a tyrant to his wife.411
Lesson 178.1
FIRST CLASS BOOK.Ask you what provocation I have had?The strong antipathy of good to bad.
When Truth or Virtue an affront endures,
The affront is mine, my friend, and should be yours:
Mine, as a foe professed to false pretence,
Who thinks a coxcomb's honor like his sense;
Mine, as a friend to every worthy mind;
And mine as man who feel for all mankind.
F. You're strangely proud-P. So proud, I am no slave.
So impudent, I own myself no knave:
So odd, my country's ruin makes me grave.
Yes, I am proud: I must be proud, to see
Men not afraid of God, afraid of me:
Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne,
Yet touched, and shamed by ridicule alone.
0, sacred weapon! left for Truth's defence,
Sole dread of folly, vice, and insolence!
Reverent I touch thee! but with honest zeal;
To rouse the watchmen of the public weal,
To Virtue's work provoke the tardy hall,
And goad the prel'ate slumbering in his stall.

Dialogue betwveen Prince Edward and his Keeper.--Miss

Ed. WHVAT brings thee now? it surely cannot be
The time of food: my prison hours are wont
To fly more heavily.
Keep. It is not food: I bring wherewith, my lord,
To stop a rent in these old walls, that oft
Hath grieved me, when I've thought of you o'nights -
Through it the cold wind visits you..Ed. And let it enter! it shall not be stopped.
Who visits me besides the winds of heaven?
Who mourns with me but the sad-sighing wind?
Who bringeth to mine ear the mimic'd tones
Of voices once beloved and sounds long past,
But the light-winged and many voiced wind?
Who fans the prisoner's lean and fevered cheek
As kindly as the monarch's wreathed brows,
But the free piteous wind?
I will not have it stopped.

When every bush doth put its glory on,
Like a gemmed bride! your rustics now
And early hinds, will set their clouted feet
Through silver webs, so bright and finely wrought
As royal dames ne'er fashioned, yet plod on
Their careless way, unheeding.
Alas, how many glorious things there be
To look upon! Wear not the forests, now,
Their latest coat of richly varied dyes?
Keep. Yes, good my lord, the cold chill year advances,
Therefore I pray you, let me close that wall.
Ed. I tell thee no, man; if the north air bites,
Bring me a cloak. WVhere is thy dog to-day?
Keep. Indeed I wonder that he came not with me
As he is wont.

He wags his tail, and looks up to my face
With the assured kindness of one
Who has not injured me.

A Sunznzer Evening Meditation.-MRs. BARBAULD.'TIs past! The sultry tyrant of the south
Has spent his short-lived rage; more grateful hours
Move silent on; the skies no more repel
The dazzled sight, but with mnil(d maiden beams
Of tempered lustre, court the cherished eye
To wander o'er their sphere; where, hung aloft,
Dian's bright crescent, like a silver low,
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns,
Impatient for the night, and seems to push
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines
Even itl the eye of day; with sweetest beam
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood
Of softened radiance from her dewy locks.
The shadows spread apace; while meeked-eyed Eve,
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires

413Through the Hesperian gardens of the west,
And shuts the gates of day.'Tis now the hour
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,
The cool damp grotto, or the lonely depth
Of unpierced woods, where wrapt in solid shade
She mused away the gaudy hours of noon,
And fed on thoughts unripened by the sun,
Moves forward; and with radiant finger points
To yon blue concave swelled by breath divine,
Where, one by one, the living eyes of heaven
Awake, quick kindling o'er the face of ether
One boundless blaze; ten thousand trembling fires,
And dancing lustres, where the unsteady eye,
Restless and dazzled, wanders unconfined
O'er all this field of glories; spacious field,
And worthy of the Master; he, whose hand
With hieroglyphics older than the Nile
Inscribed the mystic tablet; hung on high
To public gaze, and said, Adore, O man!
The finger of thy God!
How deep the silence, yet how loud the praise!
But are they silent all? or is there not
A tongue in every star, that talks with man,
And wooes him to be wise? or wooes in vain:
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.
At this still hour, the self-collected soul
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)
Has closed his golden eye, and, wrapt in shades,
Forgets his wonted journley through the east.
Seized in thought,
On fancy's wild and roving wing I sail,
From the green borders of the peopled earth,
And the pale moon, her duteous, fair attendant;
From solitary Mars; from the vast orb
Of Jupiter, whose huge gigantic bulk
Dances in ether like the lightest leaf;
To the dim verge the suburbs of the system,
Where cheerless Saturn'midst his watery moons,
Girt with a lucid zone, in gloomy pomp,

[Lesson 1S0Sits like an exLed monarch: fearless thence
I launch into the trackless deeps of space,
Where, burning round, ten thousand suns appear,
Of elder beam, which ask no leave to shine,
Of our terrestrial star, nor borrow light
From the proud regent of our scanty daySons of the morning, first-born of creation,
And only less than He who marks their track
And guides their fiery wheels.
But 0 thou mighty Mind! whose powerful word
Said, Thus let all things be, and thus they were,
Where shall I seek thy presence? how, unblamed,
Invoke thy dread perfection?
Have -the broad eye-lids of the morn beheld thee?
Or does the beamy shoulder of Orion
Support thy throne?  Oh! look with pity down
On erring, guilty man; not in thy names
Of terror clad; not with those thunders armed
That conscious Sinai felt, when fear appalled
The scattered tribes: thou hast a gentler voice,
That whispers comfort to the swelling heart,
Abashed, yet lonalng to behold her Maler.
But now my soul, unused to stretch her powers
In flight so daring, drops her weary wing,
And seeks again the known accustomed spot,
Drest up with sun, and shade, and lawns, and streams,
A mansion fair and spacious for its guest,
And all replete with wonders. Let me here,
Content and grateful, wait the appointed time,
And ripen for the skies: the hour will come,
When all these splendors bursting on my sight
Shall stand unveiled, and to my ravished sense
Unlock the glories of the world unknown.

In the hues of its grandeur, sublimely it stood,
O'er the river, the village, the field, and the wood;
And river, field, village, and woodlands grew bright,
As conscious they gave and afforded delight.'Twas the bow of Omnipotence; bent in His hand
TVhose grasp at Creation the universe spann'd;'Twas the presence of God, in a symbol sublime
His vow from the flood to the exit of Time!
Not dreadful, as when in the whirlwind he pleads,
When storms are his chariot, and lightnings his steeds,
The black clouds his banner of vengeance unfurl'd,
And thunder his voice to a guilt-stricken world;In the breath of his presence, when thousands expire,;
And seas boil with fury, and rocks burn with fire,
And the sword and the plague-spot, with death strew* the
plain,
And vultures, and wolves, are the graves of the slain  
Not such u-as the Rainbow, that beautiful one!
Whose arch was refraction, its key-stone--the Sun;
A pavilion it seem'd which the Deity graced,
And Justice and Mercy met there, and embraced.
Awhile, and it sweetly bent over the gloom,
Like Love o'er a death couch, or Hope o'er the tomb;
Then left the dark scene; whence it slowly retired,
As Love had just vanish'd, or Hope had expired.
I gazed not alone on that source of my song;
To all who beheld it these verses belong;
Its presence to all was the path of the Lord!
Each full heart expanded,-grew warm, and adored
Like a visit-the converse of friends-or a day,
That bow, from my sight, passed for ever away:
Like that visit, that converse, that day-to my heart,
That bow from remembrance can never depart.'Tis a picture in memory distinctly defined,
With the strong and unperishing colors of mind:
A part of my being beyond my control,
Beheld on that cloud, and transcribed on my soul.
* Pron. strow.Ridge. A general description of that country and its inhabitants may form the subject of a future letter. For the
present, I must entertain you with an account of a most singular and interesting adventure, which I met with, in the
course of the tour.
It was one Sunday, as I travelled through the comnty of
Orange, that my eye was caught by a cluster of horses tied
near a ruinous, old, wooden house, in the forest, not far
from  the road side.  Having frequently seen such objects
before, in travelling through these states, I had no difficulty
in understanding that this was a place of religious worship.
Devotion alone should have stopped me, to join in the
duties of the congregation; but i must confess, that curiosity, to hear the preacher of such a wilderness, was not the
least of my motives. On entering, I was struck with his
preternatural appearance. He was a tall and very spare
old man; his head, which was covered with a white linen
cap, his shrivelled hands, and his voice, were all shaking
under the influence of a palsy; and a few moments ascertained to me that he was perfectly blind.
The first emotions which touched my breast, were those
of mingled pity and veneration. But how soon were all my
feelings changed!  The lips of Plato were never more
worthy of a prognostic swarm of bees, than were the lips
of this holy man! It was a day of the administration of the
sacrament; and his subject, of course, was the passion of
our Savior. I had heard the subject handled a thousand
times: I had thought it exhausted long ago. Little did I
suppose, that in the wild woods of America, I was to meet
with a man whose eloquence would give to this topic a new
and more sublime pathos, than I had ever before witnessed.
As he descended from the pulpit, to distrib'ute the mystic
symbols, there was a peculiar, a more than human solemnity in his air and manner, which made my blood run
cold, and my whole frame shiver.
He then drew a picture of the sufferings of our Savior;
hlis trial before Pilate; his ascent up Calvary; his crucifi"don; and his death.  I knew  the whole history; but
never, until then, had I heard the circumstances so selected, so arranged, so colored! It was all new: and I seemed
to have heard it for the first time in my life. His enunciation was so deliberate, that his voice trembled on every
syllable; and every heart in the assembly trembled in uni-.
son. His peculiar phrases had that force of description,
416
TIIE AMERICAN
[Lesson 1SI.that the original scene appmared to be, at that moment,
acting before our eyes.  We saw  the very faces of the
Jews: the staring, frightful distortions of malice and rage.
WVe saw the buffet: my soul kindled with a flame of indignation; and my hands were involuntarily and convulsively
clinched.
But when he canme to touch on the patience, the forgiving meekness of our Savior; when he drew, to the life,
his blessed eyes streaming in tears to heaven; his voice
breathing to God, a soft and gentle prayer of pardon on
his enemies, "Father, forgive them, for they know  not
what they do"-the voice of the preacher, which had all
along faltered, grew fainter, and fainter, until, his utterance
being entirely obstructed by the force of his feelings, he
raised his handkerchief to his eyes, and burst into a loud
and irrepressible flood of grief. The effect is inconceivable.
The whole house resounded with the mingled groans, and
sobs, and shrieks of the congregation.
It was some time before the tumult had subsided, so far
as to permit him to proceed. Indeed, judging by the usual,
but fallacious standard of my own weakness, I began to be
very uneasy for the situation of the preacher. For I could
not conceive, how he would be able to let his audience
-down from the height to which he had wound them, without impairing the solemnity and dignity of his subject, or
perhaps shockiung them by the abruptness of the fall. Butno: the descent was as beautiful and sublime, as the elevation had been rapid and enthusiastic.
The first sentence, with which he broke the awful silence,
was a quotation from Rousseau: " Socrates died like a philosopher, but Jesus Christ, like a God!"
I despair of giving you any idea of the effect produced by
this short sentence, unless you could perfectly conceive the
whole manner of the man, as well as the peculiar crisis in
the discourse. Never before, did I completely understand
what Demosthenes meanlt by laying such stress on delivery.
You are to bring before you the venerable figure of the
preacher: his blindness, constantly recalling to your reAollection old Homer, Ossian, and Milton, and associating with
his performance, the melancholy grandeur of their geniuses;
you are to imagine that you hear his slow, solemn, well-accented enunciation, and his voice of affecting, trenlbling
melody: you are to rememlber the pitch of passion and enthusiasm to which the congregation were raised; and then,

reigned throughout the house: the preacher, removing his
white handkerchief from his aged face, (even yet wet from
the recent torrent of his tears) and slowly stretching forth
the palsied hand which holds it, begins the sentence: "S' ocrates died like a philosopher"-then pausing, raising his
other hand, pressing them  both, clasped together, with
wvarmth and energy to his breast, lifting his " sightless balls"
to heaven, and pouring his whole soul into his tremulous
voice-" but Jesus Christ-like a God!"  If he had been
indeed and in truth an angel of light, the effect could scarcely have been mnore divine.

Eternity of God.--GREEN~wooD.
WE receive such repeated intimations of decay in the
world through which we are-passing; decline and change
and loss, follow decline and chahge  aned loss in stuch rapid
succession, that we can almost catch the sound of universal
wasting, and hear the work of desolation going on busilv
around us. "The mountain falling comneth to nought, and
the rock is remove'd out of his place. The waters wear the
stones, the things which grow out of the dust of the earth
are washed away, and the hope of man is destroyed."
Conscious of our own instability, we look about for some
thing to rest on, but we look in vain. The heavens and the
earth had a beginning, and they will have an end. The face
of the world is changing, daily and hourly. All animated
things grow old and die. The rocks crumble, the trees fall,
the leaves fade, and the grass withers. The clouds are flying, and the waters are flowing away from us.
The firmest works of man, too, are gradually giving way,
the ivy clings to the mouldering tower, the brier hangs out
from the shattered window, and the wallflower springs fromn
the disjointed stones. The founders of these perishable
works have shared the same fate long ago. If we look
back to the days of our ancestors, to the men as well as the
dwellings of former times, they become immediately associated in our imaginations, and only make the feeling of instability stronger and deeper than before. In the spacious
domes, which once held our fathers, the serpent hisses, and
the wild bird screams. The halls, which once were crowded with all that taste, and science, and labor could procure, which resounded with melody, and were lighted up
with beauty, are buried by their own ruins, mocked by their
own desolation. The voice of merriment, and of wailing,
the steps of the busy and the idle have ceased in the deserted'courts, and the weeds choke the entrances, and the long
grass waves upon the hearth-stone. The works of art, the
forming hand, the tombs, the very ashes they contained, are
all gone.'While we thus walk among the ruins of the past, a sad
feeling of insecurity comes over us; and that feeling is -by

The Battle Hymn of the Berlin Landsturm.*-K6rNER
FATHER of earth and heaven! I call thy name!
Round me the smoke and shout of battle roll;
My eyes are dazzled with the rustling flame;
Father, sustain an untried soldier's soul.
Or life, or death, whatever be the goal'rhat crowns or closes round this struggling hour,
Thou knowest, if ever from my spirit stole
One deeper prayer,'twas that no cloud might lower
On my young fame!--O hear 1 God of eternal power!
God! thou art merciful.-The wintry storm,
The cloud that pours the thunder from its womb,
But show the sterner grandeur of thy form;
The lightnings, glancing through the midnight gloom,
To Faith's raised eye as calm, as lovely come,
As splendors of the autumnal evening star,
As roses shaken by the breeze's plume,
When like cool incense comes the dewy air,
And on the golden wave, the sun-set burns afar.
God.! thou art mighty!--At thy footstool bound,
Lie gazing to thee, Chance, and Life, and Death;
Nor in the Angel-circle flaming round,
Nor in the million worlds that blaze beneath,
Is one that can withstand thy wrath's hot breath.* The Landsturm (German) is the military force of the country as dlstingulshed froil the regular standing army:-the whole mass of the undisciplined
militia, called out in some suddau exigency of the state.

In the dead waist and middle of the night,
Been thus encountered: a figure, like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pie,
Appears before them, and, with solemn march,
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walked
By their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes,
WVithin his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me,
In dreadful secrecy, impart they did;
And I with them, the third night, kept the watch:

FIRST CLASS BOOI300Once on a time, La Mancha's knight, they say,
A certain bard encountering on the wavy,
Discoursed in terms as just, withl looks as sage,
As e'er could Dennis, of the Grecian stage;
Concluding all were desperate sots and fools,
Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules.
Our author, happy in a judge so nice,
Produced his play, and begged the knight's advice:
Made him observe the subject and the plot,
The manners, passions, unities; what not?
All which exact to rule were brought about,
Were but a combat in the lists left out.
"What! leave the combat out?" exclaims the knight.
Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite.
"Not so by heaven!" (he answers in a rage)
"Kni,hts, squires, and steeds must enter on the stafge."
So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain:
"Then build anew, or act it in a plai-i."
Thus critics of less judgment thanl caprice,
Curious, not knowing', not exact, but nice,
Form short ideas; and oflind in arts
(As most in manners) by a love to parts.
Some to conceit alone their taste confine,
And glittering thoughts struck out at every line;
Pleased with a work where nothing's just or fit;
One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit.
Poets, like painters, thus unskilled to trace
The naked nature, and the living grace,
With gold and jewels cover every part,
And hide with ornaments their want of art.
True wit is Nature to advantage dressed,
What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed;
Something, whose truth convinced at sight we find,
That gives us back the image of our mind.
As shades more sweetly recommend the light,
So modest plainness sets off sprig'htly wit;
For works may have more wit than does them good,
As bodies perish through excess of blood.
Others for language all their care express,
And value books, as women men,-for (Iress:
Their praise is still,-the style is excellent:
The sense, they humbly ta]ke upon content.
Words are like leaves; and where they mrost abound,
Mluch fiuit of sense beneatn is rareiy i,und.

[Lesson 190.False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,
Its gaudy colors spreads on every place;
The face of Nature we no more survey,
All glares alike, without distinction gay:
But true expressionx, like the unchabnging sun,
Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon;
It gilds all objects, but it alters none.
Expression is the dress of thought, and still
Appears more decent as more suitable'
A vile conceit in pompous words expressed,
Is like a clown in regal purple dressed:
For diflerent styles with different subjects sort,
As several garDs, with counltry, town, and court.
In words, as fashions, the satne rule will hold;
Alike fantaslti, if too new or old:
Be not the first by whom the new are tried,
Nor yet the Iast to lay the old aside.
But most by numbers judge a poet's song;
And smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong.
In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire;
Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;
WNho haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,
Not mend their minds; as some to church repair,
Not for the doctrine, but the music there.
These, equal syllables alone require,
Though oft the ear the open vowels tire:
Wthile expletives their feeble aid do join,
And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:
While they ring round the same unvaried chimes,
With sure returns of still expected rhymes;
Where'er you find the " cooling western breeze,"
In the next line it "whispers through the trees:"
If crystal streams " with pleasing murmurs creep,"
The reader's threatened, (not in vain,) with " sleep:"
Then at the last and only couplet, fraught
With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,
A needless Alexandrine ends the song,
That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.
Leave such to tune their own d-ull rhymes, and know
What's roundly smooth or languishingly slow;
And praise the easy vigor of a line,
lVhere Denhani's strength and Waller's sweetness join.
True ease in writing comes from art, not ch'ince,
As those move easiest who have learned to dance.

F'IRST CLASS BOOK,our friends, we can hardly speak to them  before they bid us
farewell.  We see them  for a few moments, and in a few
momnents more their countenances are changed. and they
are sent away.  It matteis not how near and dear they are,
The ties which bind us together are never too close to be
parted, or too strong to be broken.  Tears were never kn,vwn
to move the king  of terrors, neither is it enough  that
we are compelled to surrenider one, or two, or many of
those we love; for though the price is so great, we buy no
favor with it, and our hold on those who rernmain is as slight
as ever.  The shadows all elude our grasp, and follow one
another down the valley.  Wte gain no confidence, then, no
feeling of security, by turnin g to our contemporaries and
kindred.  We know  that the forms, which are breathing
around us, are as shortlived and fleeting as those were,
which have been dust for centuries.  The sensation of vanity,
uncertainty, and ruin, is equally strong, whether we muse on
what has long been prostrate, or gaze on what is falling now,
or will fall so soon.
If every thing whtich comes under our notice has endured
for so short a time, and in so short a time will be no more,
we cannot say that we receive the least assurance by thinking on ourselves.  When they, on whose fate we have been
meditating, were engaged in the active scenes of life, as full
of health and hope as we are now, what were we?  We had
no knowledge, no consciousness, no being; there was not a
single thing in the wide universe which knew us.  And after
the same interval shall have elapsed, which now  divides
their days from ours, what shall we be?   What thley are
now.  When a few more friends have left, a few more hopes.deceived, and a few more changes mocked us, "we shall be
brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb: the clods
of the valley shall be sweet unto us, and every man sha11
follow us, as there are innumerable before us."  All power
will have forsaken the strongest, and the loftiest will be laid
low, and every eye will be closed, and every voice hushed,
and every heart will have ceased its beating.  And when
we have gone ourselves, even our memories will not stay
behind us long. A few of the near and dea,r will bear our
likeness in their bosoms, till they too have arrived at the
end of their journey, and entered the dark dwelling of unconsciousness.  In the thoughts of others we shall live only

But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,
The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar.
When Ajax strives some rock's v'st weight to throw,
The line too labors, and the words move slow:

Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main

And bid alternate passions fall and rise!
While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove

Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,
And the world's victor stood subdued by sound.

your g man, whom I consider a rich acquisition. You tr'inscribh so well you must certainly understand grammar. Tell
me, ingenuously, my friend, did you find nothing that shocked you in writing over the homily I sent you on trial? some
neglect, perhaps, in style, or some improper term?

[ Lesson 191Arch. Young, man, you are disposed to flatter; but tell
me, which parts of it did you think most strikingly beautiful.
Gil B. If, where all was excellent, any parts were particularly so, I should say they were the personification of
hope, and the description of a good man's death.
Arch. I see you have a delicate knowledge of the truly
beautiful.  This is what I call having taste and sentiment.
Gil Bias, henceforth give thyself no uneasiness about thy
fortune, I will take care of that.  I love thee, and as a proof
of my affection, I will malke thee my confidant: yes, my
child, thou shalt be the repository of my most secret thoughts.
Listen with attention to what I am going to say.  MIy chief
pleasure consists in preaching, and the Lord gives a bless-:ng to my homilies; but I confess my weakness.  The honor
of being thought a perfect orator has charmed my imagination; my performances are thought equally nervous and
delicate; but I would of all things avoid the fault of good
authors, who write too long.  Wherefore, my dear Gil Blas,
one thing that I exact of thy zeal, is, whenever thou shalt
perceive my pen smack of old age, and my genius flag, don't
fail to advertise me of it, for I don't trust to my own judgment, which may be seduced by self-love. That observation
must proceed from  a disinterested understanding, and I
make choice of thine, which I know  is good, and am  resolved to stand by thy decision.
Gil B. Thank heaven, Sir, that time is far off. Besides,
a genius like that of your grace, will preserve its vigor
much better than any other, or, to speak more justly, will
be always the same.  I look upon you as another Cardinal
Ximines, whose superior genius, instead of being weakened, seemed to acquire new strength by age.
Arch. No flattery, friend, I knosw I am  liable to sink all
at once.  People at my age begin to feel infirmities, and
the infirmities of the body often affect the understanding.  I
repeat it to thee again, Gil Blas, as soon as thou shalt judge
mine in the least impaired, be sure to give me notice.  And
be not afraid of speaking  freely and sincerely, for I shall
receive thy advice as a mark of thy affection.
Gil B. Your grace may always depend upon my fidelity.
Arch. I know  thy sincerity, Gil B1las; and now tell me
plainly, hast thou not heard the people make some remarlcks
upon my late homilies?
Gil B. Your homilies have alvays been admired, but it
375437seems to me that the last did not appear to have had so
powerful an effect upon the audience as former ones.
Arch. How, Sir, has it met with any Aristarchus?*
Gil B. No, Sir, by no means, such works as yours are not
to be criticised; every body is charmed with them. Nevertheless, since you have laid your injunctions upon me to be
free and sincere, I will take the liberty to tell you that your
last discourse, in my judgment, has not altogether the energy of your other performances. Did you not think so,
Sir, yourself?
Arch. So, then, Mr. Gil Blas, this piece is not to your taste?
Gil B. I don't say so Sir, I think it excellent, although
a little inferior to your o)ther works.
Arch. I understand you; you think I flag, don't you? Come,
be plain; you believe it is time for me to think of retiring.
Gil B. I should not have been so bold as to speak so
freely, if your grace had not commanded me; I do no more,
therefore, than obey you; and I most humbly beg that you
will not be offended at my freedom.
Arch. God forbid! God forbid that I should find fault
with it. I don't at all take it ill that vou should speak your
sentiments, it is your sentiment itself, only, that I find bad.
I have been most egregiously deceived in your narrow understanding.
Gil B. Your grace will pardon me for obeyingArch. Say no more, my child, you are yet too raw to
make proper distinctions. Be it known to you, I never
composed a better homily, than that which you disapprove;
for, my genius, thank heaven, hath, as yet, lost nothing of
its vigor: henceforth I will make a better choice of a confidant.  Go! go, Mr. Gil Blas, and tell my treasurer to
give you a hundred ducats,t and may heaven conduct you
with that sum.  Adieu, Mr. Gil B3las! I wish you all manner
of prosperity, with a little more taste.

Alex. Hast thou not set at defiance my authority; violated the public peace, and p'assed thy life in injuring the

Robber. Alexander! I am  your captive-I must hear
what you please to say, and endure what you please to inflict. But my soul is unconquered; and if I reply at all to
your reproaches, I will repiy like a free man.
Alex. Speak freely. Far be it from me to take the advantage of my power, to silence those with whom  I deign

Robber. I must then answer your question by another.
How have you passed your life?
Alex. Like a hero. Ask Fame, and she will tell you.
Among the brave, I have been the bravest: among sovereigns, the noblest: among conquerors, the mightiest.
Robber. And does not Fame speak of me too? Was there
ever a bolder captain of a more valiant band? Was there
ever -but I scorn to boast. You yourself know that I have
not been easily subdued.
Alex. Still, what are you but a robber--a base, dishonest
robber?
Robber. And what is a conqueror?  Have not you, too,
gone about the earth like an evil genius, blasting the fair
fruits of peace and industry; plundering, ravaging, killing,
without law, without justice, merely to gratify an insatiable
lust for dominion? All that I have done to a single district
with a hundred followers, you have done to whole nations
with a hundred thousand.  If I have stripped individuals,
you have ruined kings and princes.  If I have burned a few
hamlets, you have desolated the most flourishing kingdonls
and cities of the earth.  What is, then, the difference, but
that as you were born a king, and I a private man, you have
been able to become a mightier robber than I?
Alex. But if I have taken like a king, I have given like a
king. If I have subverted empires, I have founded greater.
I have cherished arts, commerce, and philosophy.

of thle Neapolitans, who had declared their independence, and
pledged themselves to maintainz it.--MoorF..
Ar, down to the dust with them, slaves as they are!
From this hour let the blood in their da.stardly veins,
That shrunk from the first touch of Liberty's war,
Be sucked out by tyrants, or stagnate in chains!
On-on, like a cloud, through their beautiful vales,
Ye locusts of tyranny!-blisting them o'er:
Fill-fill up their wide, sfinny waters, ye sails,
From each slave-mart in Europe, and poison their shore.
1May their fate be a mock-word-may men of all lands
Laugh out with a scorn that shall ring to the poles,
When each sword, that the cowards let fall from their hands,
Shall be forged into fetters to er.ter their souls!
And deep, and more deep, as the iron is driven,
Base slaves! may the whet of their agony be,
To think--as the damamned haply think of the heaven
They had once in their reach,--that they might have
been free.
Shame! shame! when there was not a bosom, whose heat
Ever rose o'er the zero of Castlereagh's heart,
That did not, like Echo, your war-hymn repeat,
And send back its prayers with your Liberty's start!...
When the world stood in hope--when a spirit that breathed
Full fresh of the olden time whispered about,
And the swords of all Italy, half-vway unsheathed,
But waited one conquering word to flash out!

The Passions.-An Ode.-COLLINS.
WHEN Music, heavenly maid, was young,
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Thronged around her magic cell,
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possessed beyond the Muse's painting;
By turns, they felt the glowing mind
Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined:
Till once,'tis said, when all were fired,
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,
From the supporting myrtles round,
They snatched her instruments of sound;
And, as they oft had heard apart,
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,
Each, for madness ruled the hour,
Would prove his own expressive power.
First Fear, his hand, its skill to try,
Amid the chords bewildered laid;
And back recoiled, he knew not why,
E'en at the sound himself had made.
Next Anger rushed;--his eyes on fire,
In lightnings owned his secret stings,
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept with hurried hand the strings.
With woful measures wan DespairLow sullen sounds his grief beguiled:A solemn, strange, and mingled air:-'Twas sad by fits, by starts'twas wild.
But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair,
Wtvhat was thy delighted measure?
Still it -whispered promised pleasure,
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!
Still would her touch the strain prolong;
And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,
She called on Echo still through all her song:
And where her sweetest theme shle- chose,
A soft responsive voice was heard at every close,
And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair

Same subject concluded.
Is there nothing to counteract the sinking of the heart,
which must be the effect of observations like these?  Is
there no substance among all these shadows?  If all who
live and breathe around us are the creatures of yesterday,
and destined to see destruction to-morrow; if the same condition is our own, and the same sentence is written against
us; if the solid forms of inanimate nature and laborious art
are fading and falling; if we look in vain for durability to
the very roots of the mountains, where shall we turn, and
on what can we rely?  Can no support be offered; can
no source of confidence be named?  Oh yes! there is one
Being to whom we can look with a perfect conviction of
finding that security, which nothing about us can give, and
which nothing about us can take away. To this Being we
can lift up our souls, and on him we mnay rest themrr, exclaiming in the language of the monarch of Israel,." Before
the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." " Of old hast thou laid.,he foundations
of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them
shall wax old like a garment, as a vesture shalt thou change
them, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and
thy years shall have no end."
The eternity of God is a subject of contemplation, which,
at the same time that it overwhelms us with astonishment
and awe, affords us an immoveable ground of confidence in
the midst of a changing world. All things which surround us,
all these dying, mouldering inhabitants of time, must have
had a Creator, for the plain reason, that they could not have
created themselves.  And their Creator must have exixsN,d

WHEN Festin,* heavenly swain, was young,
When first attuned his viol rung,
And the soft hautboy's melting trill
Confessed the magic mnaster's skill;
Beneath his opening windows round
The admiring rabble caught the sound;
And oft, at early morn, the throng
Besieged the house to hear his song.
Till once,'tis said, when all were fired,
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,
With one consent, they brought around
Dire instruments of grating sound;
And each, for madness ruled the hour,
Would try his own sky-rending power.
First in the ranks, his skill to try,
A stout and sturdy clown was there;
A deafening hautboy, cracked and dry,
Brayed harsh discordance on the air:
With breath retained, and labored grin,
Rapt by his own tumultuous din,
With blood suspended in his face,
And paws that could not find their place,

How strong the throes that heaved his massy chejt.
Next came a brawny nurse, but six feet high,'With leathern lungs, and throat of brass supplied;
Striving with " Chevy Chase" and " Lullaby,"
To drown the screeching infant at her side.
And ever and anon the babe she seized,
And squeezed, and sung, and sung and squeezed;
Although sometimes, each dreary pause between,
The strangled infant's piercing shrieks,
And writhing limbs, and blackening cheeks,
Full well confessed the secret pin,
That keenly goaded him withinYet closer squeezed the nurse, and louder was her din.
A wheezing sawyer, standing by,
Industriously was sawing wood;
Though dull his saw, his throat though dry,
A while he used them as he could.
At length, grown tired of toil in vain,
The wretch resolved to change his strain;
With fell intent, defying nature's law,
He paused, and held his breath-to whet his saw.Wlth eyes half closed, and raised to heaven,
And starting teeth from sockets driven,
And clenching jaws, convulsed with ghastly smile,
Across the wiry edge he drew the screaking file.
A boy came next, loud whooping to the gale,
And on his truant shoulders bore a pole:
Two furious cats, suspended by the tail,
Were swinging cheek by jole.
O dulcet cats, thus hung at leisure,*
What was your delighted measure!
Entangled in no faint embrace,
With claws deep buried in each other's face,
How did ye hiss and spit your venom round,
With murderous yell of more than earthly sound!
O dulcet cats! could one more pair like you,

While scarce was heard, so loud he wound his peal,

Then came a child eloped from home,
Pleased, in the streets at large to roam;
His cart behind he dragged;-before,
A huge tin coffee-pot he bore,
Which, ever and anon, he beat
With sticks and stones in furious heat:
Nor heeded he that at his heels
The crier rung his frequent peals.
With brazen throat, and. hideous yell,
That distanced all the hounds of hell,
In air his stunning bell he tossed,
And swelled, and shouted " lost!-lost! --lost!'"

Fast to escape the hated strain,
With ears comprest, some fled amain,
While others paused, all hopeless of relief,
And cursed the stars that had not made them deaf.

Bru. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony;
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
I'll leave you.
Cas. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
I have not from your eyes that gentleness,
And show of love, as I was wont to have:
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.
Bru. Cassius,
Be not deceived; if I have veiled my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am,
Of late, with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors:
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved;
Among which number, Cassius, be you one;
Nor con'strue any further my neglect,
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
Cas. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
By means whereof, this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
B    Nv. No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
But by reflection by some other things.
Cas.'Tis just:
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
(Except immortal Caesar,) speaking of Brutus,
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.

[Lesson 199Bru. Into what daingers would you lead me, Cassius,
T'hat you would have me seek into myself,
For that which is not in me?
Cas. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your gl'ass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous of me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protestor; if you know
That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,
And after scandal them; or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
Bru. Wlhat means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Choose Cmsar for their king.
Cas. Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
Bru. I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well:But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye, and death in the other,
And I will look on both indifferently:
For, let the gods so speed me, as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death.
Cas. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be, as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.

And that same eye, whose bend doth awe the world,
Did lose its lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his, that bide the PRomans

Alas! it cried-Give me some drink, TitiniusAs a sick girl.  Ye gods, it doth amaze me,
A man of such a feeble temper should

And bear the palm alone..Bru. Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are

W-alk under his huge legs, and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at sometimes are mnasters of their fates:

But in ourselves, that we are underlings.

Why should that namer be sounded, more than your's?
Write them together; yours is as fair a name:

FRIENDS, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears:
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil, that men do, lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones:
So let it be with Cesar! The noble Brutus
Hath told you, Ctesar was ambitious.
If it were so, it was a grievous fault:And grievously hath Casar answered it.
fhere, under leave of Brutus, and the rest,
(For Brutus is an honorable m:rn,
So are they all, all honorable men;)
Come I to speak in C asar's funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambiticous;
-And Brutus is an honorable mn-a.
He hath brought many captives home to Rom,

[Lesson 900.Did this in Casar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Amlbition should be made of sterner stuff.
Yet Brutus says he was anmbitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown;
Which he did thrice refuse.  Was this anmbition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And sure he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke;
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
WThat cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
O judgmTnent, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason.-Bear with me:
My heart is in the cofflin there wvith Cesar;
And I must rause till it come back to me.
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world: now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O Masters! If I were disprosed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men.
I wrill not do them wrong--I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment, with the seal of Ctesar;
I found it in his closet:'tis his will.
Let but the commons hlear this testament,
(Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,)
And they would go and kiss dead Ctesar's wounds,
And dip their napkins in his sacred bloodYea, beg a hair of him for memory,
Anld, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing:it as a rich legacy,
Unto their issue.--

455from all eternity, for the plain reason, that the first cause
must necessarily be uncaused. As we cannot suppose a beginning without a cause of existence, that which is the cause
of all existence must be self-existent, an,l could have had
no beginning. And, as it had no beginning, so also, as it is
beyond the reach of all influence and control, as it is independent and almighty, it will have no end.
Here then is a support, which will never fail; here is a
foundation which can never be moved-the everlasting Creator of countless worlds, "the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity."  What a sublime conception! He inhabits
eternity, occupies this inconceivable duration, pervrldes and
fills throughout this boundless dwelling. Ages on ages
before even the dust of which we are formed was created,
HiE had existed in infinite majesty, and ages on ages will roll
away after we have all returned to the dust whence we
were taken, and still HE will exist in infinite majesty, living
in the eternity of his own nature, reigning in the plenitude
of his own omnipotence, for ever sending forth the word,
-wthich forms, supports and governs all things, commanding
new created light to shine on new created worlds, and raising up new created generations to inhabit themn.
The contemplation of this glorious attribute of God, is fitted to excite in our minds the most animating and consoling
reflections. Standing, as we are, amid the ruins of time,
and the wrecks of mortality, where every thing about us is
created and dependent, proceeding from nothing, and hastening to destruction, we rejoice that something is presented to our view which has stood from everlastin(r, and will remain for ever. When we have looked on the pleasures of
life, and they have vanished away; when we have looked
on the works of nature, and perceived that they were changing; on the monuments of art, and seen that they would not
stand; on our friends, and they have fled while we were
gazing; on ourselves, and felt that we were as fleeting as
they; whenwe have looked on every object to which we
could turn our anxious eyes, and they have. all told us that
they could give us no hope nor support, because they were
so feeble themselves; we can look to the throne of God:
change and decay have never reached that; the revolution
of ages has never moved it; the waves of an eternity have
been rushing past it, but it has remained unshaken; the
waves of another eternity are rushing toward it, but it is fix
ed, and can never be disturbed.

And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Cmsar followed it!This was the most unkildest* cut of all!
For, when the noble Ctesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquished him! Then burst his mighty heart:
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,t
WVhich all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.

Then I and you, and all of us, fell down;
Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.

The dint of pity:-these are gracious drops.
Kind souls! What, weep you when you but behold
Our Ctesar's vesture wounded? Look ye here!Here is himself--marred, as you see, by traitors.
Good friends! sweet friends! Let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny!
They that have done this deed are honorable!
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it! They are wise and honorable,
And will, no doubt, with reason answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts!
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But. as you know me all, a plain, blunt man,
Tha' love my friend-and that they know full well,
That gave me public leave to speak of him!
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood:-I only speak right on:
I tell you that which you yourselves do knowShow you sweet Cmsar's wounds, poor, poor, dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me. But, were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
In every wound of Cmsar, that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

Wherein, my letters (praying on his side,
Because I knew the man) were slighted off.

Cas. At such a time as this, is it not meet
That every nice offence should bear its comment?

Are much condemned to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold,
To undeservers.
Cas. I an itching palm?
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.

And chas'tisement doth therefore hide its head.

What villain touched his body, that did stab,
And not for j.ustlce?-What, shall one of us,

But for supporting robbers;-shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?
And sell the mighty space of our large honors,
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.

To make conditions.

Whose soft dominion o'er this castle sways,
And all the widely-silent places round,
Forgive me, if my trembling pen displays
What never yet was sung in mortal lays.
But how shall I attempt such arduous string,
I, who have spent my nights and nightly days
In this soul-deadening place, loose-loitering?
Ah! how shall I for this uprear my moulted wing?
The doors, that knew no shrill alarming bell,
Net cursed knocker plied by villain's hand,
Self-opened into halls, where, wiho can tell
What elegance and grandeur wide expand,
The pride of Tulrkey and of Persia land?
Soft quilts on quilts, on carpets carpets spread,
And couches stretched around in seemly band,
And endless pillows rise to prop the head;
So that each spacious room was one full-swelling bed.
-And every where huge covered tables stood,
With wines high flavored and rich viands crowned;
Whatever sprightly juice or tasteful food
On the green bosom of this Earth are found,
And all old Ocean genders in his round:
Some hand unseen these silently displayed,
Even undemanded by a sign or sound;
You need but wish, and, instantly obeyed,
Fair rianged the dishes rose, and thick the glaisses played.

simplicity of diction in some of the lines, whichl borders on the ludicrous, were
necessary to make the imnitatioli more perfect.-Author.; Ne, nor.Here Freedorl reigned without the least alloy;
Nor gossip's tale, nol ancient maiden's gall,
Nor saintly spleen, durst murmur at our joy,
And with envenomed tongue our pleasures pall.
For why? there was but one great rule for all;
To wit, that each should work his own desire,
And eat, drink, study, sleep, as it may fall,
Or melt the time in love, or wake the lyre,
And carol what, unbid, the Muses might inspire.
The rooms with costly tapestry were hung,
Where was inwoven many a gentle tale,
Such as of old the rural poets sung,
Or of Arcadian or Sicilian vale:
Reclining lovers, in the lonely dale,
Poured forth at large the sweetly tortured heart;
Or, sighing tender passion, swelled the gale,
And taught charmed Echo to resound their smart,
While flocks, woods, streams, around, repose and peace iinpart.
Each sound, too, here, to languishment inclined,
Lulled the weak bosom, and induced ease:
A&amp;rial music in the warbling wind,
At distance rising oft, by small degrees,
Nearer and nearer came, till o'er the trees
It hung, and breathed such soul-dissolving airs
As did, alas! with soft perdition please:
Entangled deep in its enchanting snares,
The listening heart forgot all duties and all cares.
A certain music, never known before,
Here lulled the pensive melancholy mind;
Full easily obtained. Behoves no more,
But sidelong, to the gently waving wind,
To lay the well-tuned instrument reclined,
From which, with airy-flying fingers light,
Beyond each mnortal touch the most refined,
The god of winas drew sounds of deep delight,
Whence, with just cause, the harp of TEolus it hight.*
Ah me! what halnd can touch the string so fine?
WVho up the lofty diapason roll
Such sweet, such sad, such solemn airs divine,
Then let them down again into the soul?

Raising a world of gayer tinct and grace,

Alas! and well-a-day! what can it be?

And labor dire it is, and weary wo:

Or saunter forth, with tottering step and slow:

Strait on the couch their limbs again they throw,
Where hours on hours they siglling lie reclined,
And court the vapory god soft-breathing in the wind.
Now must I mark the villany we found;
But, ah! too late, as shall eftsoons* be shown.
A place here was, deep, dreary, under ground,
Where still our inmates, when unpleasing grown,
Diseased, and loathsome, privily were thrown.
Far from the light of heaven, they languished there,
Unpitied, uttering many a bitter groan;
For of these wretches taken was no care:

And sought all physic which the shops bestow,

LESSON XV.
The Son.- DANA.
THERE is no virtue without a characteristic beauty to
nmake it particularly loved of the good, and to make the
bad ashamed of their neglect of it. To do what is right,
argues superior taste as well as morals; and those whose
practice is evil, feel an inferiority of intellectual power and
enjoyment, even where they take no concern for a principle.  Doing well has something  more in it than the fulfilling
of a duty. It is a cause of a just sense of elevation of character; it clears and strengthens the spirits; it gives higher
reaches of thought; it widens our benevolence, and makes
the current of our peculiar affections swift and deep.
A sacrifice was never yet offered to a principle, that was
not made up to us by self approval, and the consideration
of what our degra(dation would have been had we done
otherwise.  Certainly, it is a pleasant and a wise thing,
then, to follow what is right, ivhen we only go along with
our affections, and take the easy way of the virtuous propensities of our nature.
The world is sensible of these truths, let it act as it may.

The Ass and the Nightingale.-KRILOV.
[From Bowring's Russian Anthology.]

And shouted out, "It la! holla! good friend!

I really wish to know-the world is partial ever--

Through all the regions of sweet music ranging,
Varying her song a thousand different ways;
Rising ar lling, lingering, ever changing:
Full of wig rapture now-then sinking oft
To almost silence-melancholy, soft,
As distant shepherd's pipe at evening's close:Strewing* the wood with lovelier music;-there
All nature seems to listen and reposbe:
No zephyr dares disturb the traniquil air:All other voices of the grove are still,
And the charmed flocks lie down beside the rill.
The shepherd-like a statue stands-afraid
His breathing may disturb the melody,
His finger pointing to the harmonious tree,
Seems to say, " Listen!" to his favorite maid
The singer ended:--and our critic bowed
His reverend head to earth, and said aloud:" Now that's so so;-thou really hast some merit;
Curtail thy song, and critics then might hear it;
Thy voice wants sharpness:--but if Chanticleer
Would give thee a few lessons, doubtless he
Might raise thy voice and modulate thy ear;
And thou in spite of all thy faults may'st be
A very decent singer."The poor bird
In silent modesty the critic heard,
And winged her peaceful flight into the air,
O'er many and many a field and forest fair.
Many such critics you and I have seen:EIeaven be our screen!

In robes of darkness, rides upon the wind
Across the clouded vault of heaven.  What eye

Battle of Flodden Field, anzd Death of lFlarmion.-From SCOTT.
BLOTJNT and Fitz-Eustace rested still
With Lady Clare upon the hill;
On which, (for far the day was spent,)
The western sun-beams now were bent
The cry they heard, its meaning knew,
Could plain their distant comrades view:
Sadly to Blount did Eustace say,
"Unworthy office here to stay!
No hope of gilded spurs to-dayBut, see! look up-on Flodden bent,
The Scottish foe has fired his tent."
And sudden, as he spoke,
From the sharp ridges of the hill,
All downward to the tanks of Till,
Wras wreathed in sable smoke;
Volimed, and vast, and rolling far,
The cloud enveloped Scotland's war,
As down the hill they broke:
Nor martial shout, nor minstrel tone,
Announced their march; their tread alone
At times one warning trumpet blown,
At times a stifled' hum,
Told England, from his mountain-throne
King James did rushing come.
Scarce could they hear, or see their foes,
Until at weapon-point they close.
They close, in clouds of smoke and dust,
With sword-sway, and with lance's thrust;
And such a yell was there,
Of sudden and portentous birth,
As if men fought upon the earth,
And fiends in upper air.

FIRST CLASS BOOK.At length the freshening western blast
Aside the shroud of battle cast;
And, first, the ridge of mingled spears
Above the brightening cloud appears;
And in the smoke the pennons flew,
As in the storm the white sea-mew.
Then marked they dashing broad and far,
The broken billows of the war,
And plumed crests of chieftains brave,
Floating like foam upon the wave;
But nought distinct they see:
Wide raged the battle on the plain;
Spears shook, and falchions* flashed amain;
Fell England's arrow-flight like rain;
Crests rose, and stooped, and rose again,
Wild and disorderly.
Yet still Lord Marmion's falcont flew
With wavering flight, while fiercer grew
Around the battle yell.
The Border slogan AMit the sky:
A Home! a Gordon! was the cry;
Loud were the clanging blows;
Advanced,-forced back,-now low, now hlgn,
The pennon sunk and rose:
As bends the bark's mast in the gale,
When rent are rigging, shrouds, and sail,
It wavered mid the foes.
No longer Blount the view could bear:
"By heaven, and all its saints! I swear,
I will not see it lost!
Fitz-Eustace, you with Lady Clare
May bid your beads, and patter prayer,
I gallop to the host."
And to the fray he rode amain,
Followed by all the archer train.
The fiery youth, with desperate charge,
Made, for a space, an opening large,The rescued banner rose:But darkly closed the war around;
Like pine-tree, rooted from the ground,
It sunk among the foes.

A look and sign to Clara cast,
To mark he would return in haste,
Then plunged into the fight.
Ask me not -what the maiden feels,

Perchaince her reason stoops, or reels;
Perchance a courage, not her own,
Braces her mind to desperate tone.The scattered van of England wheels;She only said, as loud in air
The tumult roared. " Is Wilton there?"They fly, or, maddened by despair,
Fight but to die.-" Is Wilton there?"With that, straight up the hill there rode
Two horsemen, drenched with gore,
And in their arms, a helpless load,
A wounded knight they bore.
Hlis hand still strained the broken brand;
His arms were smeared with blooJ, and sand;
Dragged from the horses' feet,
With dinted shield, and helmet beat,
The falcon-crest and plumage gone;

Young Blount his armor did unlace.
And, gazing on his ghlastly face,
Said-" By Saint George, he's gone!

And see the deep cut on his head!

" Unnurtured Blount! thy brawling cease:

They parted, and alone he lay,

Till pain wrung forth a lowly moan,
And half ne murmured,-" Is there none,

To shrive the dying, bless the dead.

And, as she stooped his brow to lave"Is it tne hand of Clare," he said,
"Or injured Constance, bathes my head?"
I would the Fiend, to whom belongs
The vengeance due to all her wrongs,
Would spare me but a day!

And priests slain on the altar-stone,
Might bribe him for delay.

Supported by the trembling Monk.
The war, that for a space did fail,
Now trebly thundering swelled the gale,
And-Stanley! was the cry;A light on Marmion's visage spread,
And fired his glazing eye:
With dying hand, above his head
He shook the fragment of his blade,
And shouted " Victory!"Charge, Chester, charge! On, Stanley, on!'

wise conduct in the long run, than in the scheines of those
of greater intellect, who go at large without any landmnarks
of principle.  So that virtue seemls of a double nature, and
to stand oftentimes in the place of what we call talent.
This reasoning, or rather feeling, of the worldl is all right;
for the honest man only falls in with the order of nature,
which is grounded in truth, and will endure along with it.
And such a hold has a good man upon the world, that even
where he has not been called upon to make a sacrifice to a
principle, or to take a stand against wrong, but has merely
avoided running into vices, and suffered himself to be borne
along by the delightful and virtuous affections of private life,
an i has found his pleasure in practising the duties of home,
he is looked up to with respect, as well as regarded with
kindness.  We attach certain notions of refinement to his
thoughts, and of depth to his sentiment. The impression he
makes on us is beautiful and peculiar.  Other men in his
presence, though we have nothing to object to themn, and
though they may be very well in their way, affect us as lacking something-we can hardly tell what-a certain sensitive delicacy of character and manner, without which they
strike us as more or less vulgar.
No creature in the world has this character so finely
marked in him, as a respectfill and affectionate son-particularly in his relation to his mother. Every little attention
he pays her, is not only an expression of filial attachment,
and a grateful acknowledgment of past cares, but is an evidence of a tenderness of disposition which moves us the
more, because not looked on so much as an essential property in a man's character, as an added grace which is bestowed only upon a few. His regards d.o not appear like
mere habits of duty, nor does his watchfulness of his mother's wishes seem like taught submission to her will.  They
are tle native courtesies* of a feeling minid, showing themselves amidst stern virtues and masculine energies, like
gleams of light on points of rocks.  They are delightful as
evidences of power yielding voluntary homage to the delicacy of the soul.  The armed knee is bent, and the heart
of the mailed iman laid bare.
Feelings that would seem to be at variance with each
other, meet together and harmonize in the breast of a son.

act of submission which he performs, are not only so many

LESSON CCIX.
On the moral uses of various appearances in the material universe.-ALISON.
By means of the expressions of which it is every where
significant, the material universe around us becomes a scene
of moral discipline; and in the hours when we are most unconscious of it, an influence is perpetually operating, by
which our moral feelings are awakened, and our moral sensibility exercised.   Whether in the scenery of nature, amid
the works and invet;ions of men, amid the affections of
home, or in the inter, ourse of general society, the material
forms which surroun t us are secretly but incessantly influencing our character r    nd dispositions.  And in the hours of
the most innocent dellght, while we are conscious of nothing
but the pleasures we enj(oy, the beneficence of Him that
made us, is employed in conducting a secret discipline, by
which our moral improvement is consulted, and those sentiments and principles are formed, which are afterwards to
create not only our genuine honor, but the happiness of
all with whom it is our fortane to be connected.
There is yet, howvever, a greater expression which the
appearances of the material world are fitted to convey, and
a more important influence, which, in the design of nature,
they are destined to produce upon us; their influence, I
mean, in leading us directly to religious sentimnent.  Had
organic enjoyment been the only object of our formation,
it would have been sufficient to establish senses for the reception of these enjoyments.-But if the promises of our
nature are greater; if it is destined to a nobler conclusion;
if it is enabled to look to the Author of being himself, and
to feel its proud relation to HIM; then nature, in all its aspects around us, ought only to be felt as signs of his providence, and as conductingT us, by the universal language of
these signs, to the throne of the Deity.
How much this is the case with every pure and innocent
mind, I flatter myself few of my readers will require any
illustration.  Whether in fact, the eye of man opens upon
478
THE AMERICAN
[Lesson 209any sublime or any beautiful scene of nature, the first impression is to consider it as designed-as the effect or workmanship of the Author of nature, and as significant of his
power, his wisdom, or his goodness: and perhaps it is chiefly for.this fine issue, that the heart of man is thus finely
tozuched, that devotion may spring from  delight; that the
imagination, in the midst of its highest enjoyments, may be
led to terminate in the only object in which it can finally repose; and that all the noblest convictions and confidences
of religion, may be acquired in the simple school of nature,
and amid the scenes which perpetually surround us.
AWVherever vwe observe, accordingly, the workings of the
human mind, whether in its rudest, or its most improved appearances, we every where see this union of devotional sentiment with sensibility to the expressions of natural scenery.
It calls forth the hymn of the infant bard, as well as the anthem of the poet of classic times.  It prompts the nursery
tales of superstition, as well as the d6monstra'tion of the school
of philosophy.  There is no era so barbarous in which man
has existed, in which the traces are not to be seen of the.alliance which he has felt between earth and heaven; or of
the conviction he has acquired, of the mind that created nature, by the signs which it exhibits: and amid the wildest,
as amid the most genial scenes of an uncultivated world, the
rude altar ofL the savage every where marks the emotions
that swelled in his bosomn wvln he erected it to the awfiul
or the beneficent deities, whose imaginary presence it records.
In ages of civilization aind refinement, this union of devotional sentiment with sensibility to the beauties of natural
scenery, forms one of the most characteristic nmarks of human improvement, and may be traced in every art whicih
professes to give delight to the imagination. The funereal
urn, and the inscription to the dead, present themselves
every where as the mnost interesting incidents in the scenes
of ornamental nature.  In the landscape of the painter, the
colurmns of the temple, or the spire of the chulrch, rise amid
the ceaseless luxuriance of vegetable life, and, by their contrast, give the mighty moral to the scene, whlich we love,
even while we dread it: the powers of music have reached only their highest perfection when they have been devoted to the services of religion: and the description of the
genuine poet has seldom concluded, without some hymn to
the Author of the universe, or some warm appeal to the devotional sensibility of mankind.

and all the artificial pleasures which they feel have occu.

seem to breathe a purer air, and to experience some more

It is on this account that it is of so much consequence, in
the education of the young, to encourage their instinctive
taste for the beauty and sublimity of nature. While it opens
to the years of infancy and youth a source of pure and of
permanent enjoyment, it has consequences on the character
and happiness of future life, which they are unable to foresee. It is to provide them, amid all the agitations and trials
of society, with one gentle and unreproaching, friend, whose
voice is ever in alliance with goodness and virtue, and
which, when once understood, is able both to smooth misfortune and?to reclaim from folly. It is to identify them
with the happiness of that nature to which they belong; to
give th-m an interest in every species of being which surrounds them; and, amid the hours of curiosity and delight,
to awaken those latent feelings of benevolence and of sympathy from which all the moral or intellectual greatness of.man finally arises. It is to lay the foundation of an early
and of a manly piety; amid the magnificent system of material signs in which they reside, to give thenl t[he mighty
key which can interpret them; and to make them look
upon the universe which they inhabit, not as the abode only
of human cares, or human joys, but as the temple of the

In looking over some papers of a deceased acquaintance,
I found the following fragment.  He had frequently spoken
to me of the person whom. it concerned, and who had been
his schoolfellow.  I remember well his one day telling me,
that thinking the character of his friend, and some circumstances in his life, were of such a kind that an interesting,
nmoral little story might be made from them, he had under.
taken it; but considering as he was going on, that bringing
the private character and feelings of a deceased friend before the world, was something like sacrilege, though done
under a fictitious name, he had stopped soon after beginning the tale-that he had laid it away amongst his papers,
and had never looked at it again.

Arthur raised himself heavily forward, and with his hat
still over his brow, turned his glazed and dim  eyes towards
the setting sun.  It was only the night before that he had
heard his mother was ill, and could survive but a day or two.
He had lived nearly apart from  society, and, being a lad of
a thoughtlful, dreamy mind, had made a world to himself.
His thoughts and feelings were so much in it, that except
in relation to his owvn home, there were the same vague and
strange notions in his brain concerning the state of things
surrounding him, as we have of a foreign land.

himself a being suited to his own fancies.  This was the
romance' of life, and though men, with minds like his, make
imagination to stand oftentimes in the place of real existence, and to trake to itself as deep feeling and concern, yet
in domestic relations, which are so near, and usual, and
private, they feel longer and more deeply than those who
look upon their homes as only a better part of the world
which they belong to.  Indeed, in affectionate and good
men of a visionary cast, it is in some sort only realizing their
hopes and desires, to turn them homeward.  Arthur felt that
it was so, and he loved his household the more that they
gave him an earnest of one day realizing all his hopes and
attachments.
Arthur's mother was peculiarly dear to him, in having a
character so much like his own.  For though the cares and
attachments of life had long ago taken place of a fanciful
existence in her, yet her natural turn of mind was strong
_enough to give to these something of the romance' of her
disposition.  This had led to a more than usual openness
and intimacy between Arthur and his mother, and now
brought to his remembrance the hours they had sat togeth.
er by the fire light, when he listened to her mild and melancholy voice, as she spoke of what she had undergone at the
loss of her parents and husband. Her gentle rebuke of his
faults, her affectionate look of approval when he had done
well, her care that he should be a just man, and her motherly anxiety lest the world should go.hard with him, all
crowded into his niind, and he thought that every worldly
attachment was hereafter tc be a vain thing.
He had passed the night between violent, tumultuous
grief, and numb insensibility.  Stepping into the carriage,
with a slow, weak motion, like one who was quitting his sick
chamber for the first time, he began his journey homeward.
As he lifted his eyes upward, the few stars that were here
and there over the sky, seemed to look down in pity, and
shed a religious and healing light upon him.  But they soon
went out, one after another, and as the last faded from his
imploring sight, it was as if every thing good and-iholy had
forsaken himn.  The faint tint in the east soon became a
ruddy glow, and the sun, shooting upward, burst over every
living thing in full glory.  The sight went to Arthur's sick
heart, as if it were in mockery of his misery.
Leaning back in his carriage, with his hand over his eyes,

TIIE AMERICANhe was carried along, hardly sensible it was day.  The old
servant, Thomas, who was sitting by his side went on talking in a low monotonous tone; but Arthur only heard something sounding in his ears, scarcely heeding that it was a
human voice.  He had a sense of wearisomeness from the
motion of the carriage, but in all things else the day passed
as a melancholy dream.
Almost the first words Arthur spoke were those I have
mentioned. As he looked out upon the setting sun, he shuddered through his whole frame, and then became sick and
pale.  He thought he knew  the hill near him; and as they
wound round it, some peculiar old trees appeared, and he
was in a few  minutes in the midst of the scenery near his
home.  The river before him  reflecting the rich evening
sky, looked as if poured out from a molten mine.  The birds,
gathering in, were shooting across each other, bursting into
short, gay notes, or singing their evening songs in the trees.
It was a bitter thing to find all so bright and cheerful, and
so near his own home too.  His horses' hoofs struck upon
the old wooden bridge. The sound went to his heart. It
was here his mother took her last leave of him, and blessed
him.
As he passed through the village, there was a feeling of
strangeness, that every thing should be just as it',as when
he left it.  There was an undefined thought floating in his
mind, that his mother's state should produce a visible chinge
in all that he had been familiar with.  But the boys we:;e at
their noisy  games in the street, the laborers returning,
talking together, from  their work, and the old men sitting'
quietly at their doors.  He concealed himself as well as he
could, and bade* Thomas hasten on.
As they drew  near the house, the night was shutting in
about it, and there was a melancholy gusty sound in the
trees. Arthur felt as if approaching his mother's totnb.
He entered the parlor.  All was as gloomy and still as a
deserted house. Presently he heard a slow, cautious step, over
head.  It was in his mother's chamber.  His sister had seen
him  from the window.  She hurried down, and threwv  ter
armns about her brother's neck, without uttering a word.  As
soon as he could speak, he asked, "Is she alive?"-he
could not say, my mother.  "She is sleeping," answel ed
liis sister, "  and must not know to-night that you are hero;
she is too weak to bear it now."  "I will go look at

shed the first tears which had fallen fromn hinm that day, and
he was more composed.
He enterec  the chamber with a deep and still awe upon
him: and as he drevw near his mother's bed-side, alnd lookied
on hler pale, placidl, and motionless face, he scarcely dared
oreathe lest he should disturb the secret communion that
thle soul was holding with the world illto whicl it wvas about

slightly as she uttered an indistinct sound.  He drew back,
and his sister went near to her, and she spoke.  It was the
same gentle voice wlhich he had known and felt from his
childhood.  The exaltationl of his soul left himn-he sunk
down-and his misery went over him like a flood.
LESSON XVI.
Thue sane- conclzded.
TuIE next dav, as socn as his mother became composed
enough tb see him, Arthur went into her chamber.   She
stretched out her feeble hand, and turneud towards him, with
a look that blessed him.  It was the short struggle of a
meek spirit.  She covered her e-ves wvitil her hand, and the
tears trickled down between her pale, thin fingers.  As soon
as she became tranquil, she spoke of the gratitude she felt
being spared to see him before she died.
"My dear rnother," said Arthur--but he could not g(;
on.  IIis voice was choked, his eyes filled with tears, and
the agony of his soul was visible in his face.  "-Do not be so
afflicted, Arthur, at the loss of me.  We are not to part
forever.  Remember, too, how  co-mfortable and happy you
have made my days.  Heaven, I know, will bless so good a

THE AMIERICANto her." She paused for a moment. " I have always felt
that I could meet death with composure; but I did not
know," she said, with a tremulous voice, her lips quivering
--" I did not know how hard a thing it would be to leave
my children, till now that the hour has come."
After a little while, she spoke of his father, and said, she
had lived with the belief that he was mindful of her, and
with the conviction, which grew stronger as death approached, that she should meet him in another world. She said
but little more, as she grew weaker and weaker every hour.
Arthur sat by in silence, holding, her hand. Ile saw that she
vwa- sensible he was watching her countenance, for every
now and then she opened her dull eye, aiid looked towards
him and endeavored to smnile.

lamp in the chimney corner, the furniture in the room threw
hluge and uncouth figures over the walls. All was unsubstantial and visionary, and the shadowy ministers of death
appeared gathering round, waiting the duty of the hour
appointed thenl. Arthur shuddered for a moment with
superstitious awe; but the solemn elevation which a good
man feels at the sight of the dying, took possession of him,
and he became calm again.
The approach of death has so much which is exalting,
that our grief is, for the time, forgotten. And could one
who had seen Arthur a few hours before, now have looked
upon the grave and grand repose of his countenance, he
would hardly have known him.
The livid hue of death was fast spreading over his mother's face. He stooped forward to catch the sound of her
breathing. It grew quick and faint--" My mother."-She
opened her eyes, for the last time, upon him-a faint flush
passed over her cheek--there was the serenity of an angel
in her look-her hand just pressed his. It was all over.
His spirit had endured to its utmost. It sunk down from
its unearthly height; and with his face upon his mother's
pillow, he wept like a child. He arose with a violent effort,
and stepping into the ad'oining chamber, spoke to his aunt.

Lesson 16,]
49"It is past,' said he.  " Is my sister asleep?--Well, then
let her have rest; she needs it." He then went to his
own chamber and shut himself in.
It is a merciful thing that the intense suffering of sensitive
minds makes to itself a relief.  Violent grief brings on a
torpor, and awn indistinctness, and dimness, as from long
Ywatching.  It is not till the violen:e of affliction has subsided, and gentle and soothing thoughts can find room  to mix
with our sorrow, and holy consolations can minister to us,
that we are able to know fully our loss, and see clearly what
has been torn away from  our affections.  It was so with
Arthur.  Unconnected and strange thoughts, with melancholy but half-formed images, were floating in his mind,
and now and then a gleam of light would pass through it, as
if he had been in a troubled trance, and all was right again.
His worn and tired feelings at last found rest in sleep.
It is an impression which we cannot rid ourselves of if
we would, when sitting by the body of a friend, that he has
still a consciousness of our presence-that though the commonl concerns of the world have no more to do with him,
he has still a love and care of us.  The face which we had
so long been familiar with, When it was all life and motion,
seems only in a state of rest.  We know not how to make
it real to ourselves, that the body before us is not a living
thing.
Arthur was in such a state of nind, as he sat alone in the
room by his mother, the day after her death.  It was as if
her soul had been in paradise, and was now holding commurnion with pure spirits there, though it still abode in the
body that lay before him. He felt as if sanctified by the
presence of one to whom  the other -world had been laid
open-as if under the love and protection of one made holy.
The religious reflections that his mother had early taught
him, gave him strength; a spiritual composure stole over
him, and he found himself prepared to perform the last offices to the dead.
Is it not enough to see our friends die, and part with them
for the remainder of our days-to reflect that we shall hear
their voices no more, and that they will never look on us
again-to see that turning to corruption which was but just
now alive, and eloquent, and beautiful with all the sensations of the solll? Are our sorrows so sacred and peculiar
as to make the world as vanity to us, and the men of it as
strangers, and shall we not be left to our afflictions for a few
AnO
THE AMERICAN
[Zesson 16,hours? Must we be brought out at such a time to the concerned, or careless gaze of those we know not, or be mrade
to bear the formal proffers of consolation from acquaintances who will go away and forget it all? Shall we not be
suffered a little while, a holy and healing communion with
the dead? Must the kindred stillness and gloom  of our
dwelling be changed for the solemn show of the pall, the
talk of the passers-by, and the broad and piercing light of
the comnmon sun? Must the ceremonies of the world wait
on us even to the open graves of our friends?
When the hour came, Arthur rose with a firm step and
fixed eye, though his whole face was tremulous with the
strulggle within him. He went to his sister, and took her
arm  within his. The bell struck. Its he-.Y:v, undulating
sound rolled forward like a sea. He felt a violent beating
through his whole frame, which shook him that he reeled.
It was but a momentary weakness. He moved on, passing
those who surrounded him, as if they had been shadows.
While he followed the slow hearse, there was a vacancy in
his eye as it rested on the coffin, which showed him hardly
conscious of what was before him. His spirit was with his
mother's. As he reached the grave, he shrunk back and
turned deadly pale; but sinking his head upon his breast,
and drawing his hat over his face, he stood motionless as a
statue till the service was over.
He had gone through all that the forms of society required of him. For as painful as the effo:t was, and as little
suited as such forms were to his own thoughts upon the subject, yet he could not do any thing that might appear to the
world like a want of reverence and respect for his mother.
The scene was ended, and the inward struggle over; and
now that he was left to himself, the greatness of his loss
came up full and distinctly before himn.
It was a dreary and chilly evening when he returned
home. When he entered the house from which his mother
had gone for ever, a sense of dreary emptiness oppressed
him, as if his very abode had been deserted by every living
thing. He walked into his mother's chamber. The naked
bedstead, and the chair in which she used to sit, were all
that was left in the room. As he threw himself back into
the chair, he groaned in the bitterness of his spirit. A feeling of forlo-rnness came over him which was not to be relieved by tears. She, whom he had watched over in her dying
hour, and whom he had talked to as she lay before him in

FIRST CLASS BOOK.death, as if she could hear and answer him, had gone from
him. Nothing was left for the senses to fasten fondly on, and
time had not yet taught him to think of her only as a spirit.
But time and holy endeavors brought this consolation; and
the little of life that a wasting disease left him, was past by
him, when alone, in thoughtful tranquillity; and amongst his
friends he appeared with that gentle cheerfulness which,
before his mother's death, had been a part of his nature.

But not in vengeance. Misery is wed
To guilt. And hence these shades are still the abodes

THE AMERICANyou lose sigllt of the land you have left, all is vacancy until you step on the opposite shore, and are launched at once
into the bustle and novelties of another wvorld.
I have said that at sea all is vacancy.  I should correct
the  expression.  To one given up to day-dreaming, and
fond of losing himself in re.veries, a sea voyage is full of
subjects for meditation; but then they are the wonders of the
deep, and of the air, and rather tend to abstract the mind
from worldly themes.  I delighted to loll over the quarterrailing, or climb to the main-top on a calm day, and muse
for hours together on the tranquil bosom of a summer's sea;
or to gaze upon the piles of golden clouds just peering above
the horizon, fancy them some fairy realms, and people them
with a creation of my own, or to watch the gentle undulating billows rolling their silver volumes, as if to die away on
those happy shores.
There was a drelicious sensation of mingled security and
awe, with which I looked down from mry giddy height on the
monsters of the deep at their uncouth gambols. Shoals
of porpoises tumbling about the bow of the ship; the grampus slox-ly heaving his huge form' above the surface; or
the ravenous shark, darting lilke a spectre, through the
blue waters. IMy imagination would conjure* up all that I
had heard; or read of the watery world beneath me; of the
finny herds. that roam its fathomless valleys; of shapeless
monsters that lurk among the very foundations of the earth;
and those wild phantasmrs that swell the tales of fishermen
and sailors.
Sometimes a distant sail gliding along the edge of the
ocean would be another theme of idle speculation.  How
interesting this frag'ment of a world hastening to rejoin the
great mass of existence!- What a glorious monument of
human invention, that has thus triumphed over wind and
wave; has brought the ends of the earth in communion;
has established an interchange of blessings, pouring into the
steril regions of the north all the luxuries of the south;
diffused the light of- know}edge and the charities of cultivated life-; and has thus bound- together those scattered
portions of -the -human  -race, belween which nature seemed
to have'thrown an insurmountable'barrier!
We one day descried some shapeless object drifting at
a distance.  At sea, every thihg that breaks the monotony
of the surrounding expanse attracts' attention.  It proved
to be the mast of a ship that must have been completely

In the Clerk's Office of tf.e District Court of Massachusetts.wrecked; for therm were the remains of handkerchiefs, by
which some of the crew had fastened themselves to this
spar, to prevent their being washed off by the waves.
There was no trace by which the name of the ship could
be ascertained.  The wreck had evidently drifted about for
many months; clusters of shell-fish had fastened about it,
and  long sea-weeds flaunted at its sides.  But where,
thought I, is the crew?  Their struggle has long been
over;-they have gone down amidst the roar of the tempest;-their bones lie whitening in the caverns of the deep.
Silence-oblivion, like the waves, have closed over them,
and no one can tell the story of their end.
What sighs have been wafted after that ship! what prayers offered up at the deserted fire-side of home! How
often has the mistress, the wife, and the mother, pored over
the daily news, to catch some casual intelligence of this
rover of the deep! How  has expectation darkened into
anxiety-anxiety into dread-and dread into despair! Alas!
not one memento shall ever return for love to cherish.  All
that shall ever be known is, that she sailed from her port,
" and was never heard of more."
The sight of the wreck, as usual, gave rise to many dismal anecdotes. This was particularly the case in the evening, when the weather, which had hitherto been fair, began
to look wild and threatening, and gave indications of one
of those sudden storms that will sometimes break in upon
the serenity of a summer voyage. As we sat round the
dull light of a lamp, in the cabin, that made the gloom
more ghastly, every one had his tale of shipwreck and disaster. I was particularly struck with a short one related
by the captain.
"As I was once sailing," said he, " in a fine stout ship
across the banks of Newfoundland, one of the heavy fogs
that prevail in those parts rendered it impossible for me to
see far a-head, even in the day-time; but at night the weather was so thick that we could not distinguish any object
at twice the length of our ship. I kept lights at the masthead, and a constant watch forward to look out for fishingsmacks, which are accustomed to lie at anchor on the banks.
The wind was blowing a smacking breeze, and we were going at a great rate through the water. Suddenly the watch
gave the alarm of'a sail a-head!' but it was scarcely uttered till we were upon her.  She was a small schooner at
anchor, with her broadside towards us.  The crew were all
[Lesson 19,asleep, and had neglected to hoist a light.  We struck her
just a-mid-ships. The force, the size, and weight of our
vessel, bore her down below  the waves; we passed over
her, and were hurried on our course.
" As the crashing wreck was sinking beneath us, I had a
glimpse of two or three half-naked wretches, rushing from
her cabin; they had just started from  their beds to be
swallowed shrieking by the waves. I heard their drowning
cry mingling with the wind.  The blast that bore it to our
ears, swept us out of all further hearing.  I shall never forget that cry! It was some time before we could put the
ship about, she was under such headway.  WVe returned, as
nearly as we could guess, to the place where the smack was
anchored.  We cruised about for several hours in the dense
fog.  We fired several guns, and listened if we might hear
the halloo' of any survivors; but all was silent--we never
heard nor saw any thing of them more!"
It was a fine sunny morning when the thrilling cry of
"land i" was given from the mast-head.  I question whether Columbus, when he discovered the new  world, felt a
more delicious throng of sensations than rush into an American's bosom when he first comes in sight of Europe.
There is a volume of associations in the very name. It is
the land of promise, teeming with every thing of which his
childhood has heard, or on which his studious years have
pondered.
Fro:n that time until the period of arrival, it was all feverish excitement. The ships of war that prowled like guardian  giants round the coast; the headlands of Ireland,
stretching out into the channel; the Welsh mountains, towering into the clouds; all were objects of intense interest.
As we sailed up the Mersey, I reconnoitred the shores with
a telescope.  My eye dwelt with delight on neat cottages,
with their trim shrubberies and green grass plots.  I saw the
mouldering ruins of an abbey overrun with ivy, and the taper spire of a village church rising from the brow of a neighboring hill-all were characteristic of England.
The tide and wind were so favorable, that the ship was
enabled to ceme at once at the pier.  It was thronged with
people; some idle lookers-on, others eager expectants of
friends or relatives.  I could distinguish the merchant to.whom the ship _belonged. I knew him by his calculating
brow and restless air. His hands were thrust into his pockets; he was whistling thoughtfully, and walking to and fro,

FlstST CLASS BOOK.a small space having been accorded to him by the crowd,
in deference to his temporary importance.  There were
repeated cheerings and salutations interchanged between the
shore and the ship, as friends happened to rSc'ognise each
other.
But I particularly noted one young woman of humnble
dress, but interesting demeanor.-She was leaning forward
from among the crowd; her eye hurried over the ship as it
neared the shore, to catch some wished-for countenance.
She seemed disappointed and agitated, when I heard a faint
voice call her name. It was from a poor sailor, who had
been ill all the voyage, and had excited the sympathy of
every one on board. When the weather was fine, his messmates had spread a mat'trass for him  on deck in the
shade; but of late his illness had so increased, that he had
taken to his hammock, and only breathed a wish that he
might see his wife before he died.
He had been helped on deck as we came up the river,
and was now leaning against the shrouds, with a countenance so wasted, so pale, and so ghastly, that it is no wonder
even the eye of affection did not r.c'ognise him. But at the
sound of his voice, her eye darted on his features, it read at
once a whole volume of sorrow; she clasped her hands,
uttered a faint shriek, and stood wringing them  in silent'.agony.
All now was hurry and bustle. The meetings of acquaintances-the greetings of friends-the con:0ultations of
men of business. I alone was solitary and idle. I had no
friend to meet, no cheering to receive. I stepped upon the
land of my forefathers--but' felt that I was a stranger in the
land.

Brief deseription of Pomnpey's Pillar--Address and fearlessness of Britishz Sailors.--IRwN.
IN visiting Alexandria, what most engages the attention
of travellers, is the pillar of Pompey, as it is commonly
called, situated at a quarter of a league from the southern
gate. It is composed of red granite. The capital is Corinthian with palm leaves, and not indented. It is nine feet
[Lesson 20.
C8high.  The shaft and the upper member of the base are
of one piece of 90 feet long, and nine in diameter.  The
base is a square of about 15 feet on each side. This block
of marble, 60 feet in circumference, rests on two layers of
stone bound together with lead; which, however, has not
prevented the Arabs from  forcing out several of them, to
search for an imaginary treavure.
The whole columnt is 114 feet high.  It is perfectly well
polished, and only a litlle shivered on the eastern side.  Nothing can equal the majesty of this montument: seen from  a
distance, it overtops the town, and serves as a signal for vessels.  Approaching it nearer, it produces an astonishment
mixed with awe.  One can never be tired with admiring the
beauty of the capital, the length of the shaft, or the extraordinary'simplicity of the ped'estal. This last has been somewhat damaged by the instruments of travellers who are curious to possess a relic of this antiquity; and one of the
voluites' of the column was prematurely brought down about
twelve years ago, by a prank of some English captains,
which is thus related by Mr. Irwin.
These jolly sons of Neptune had been pushing about the
can on board one of the ships in the harbor, until a strange
freak entered the brain of one of them.  The eccentricity of
the thought occasioned it immediately to be adopted; and
its apparent impossibility was but a spur for putting it
into execution.  The boat was ordered; and with proper
implements for the attempt, these enterprising heroes pushed ashore to drink a bowl of punch on the top of Pomupey's
Pillar! At the spot they arrived; and many contrivances
were proposed to accomplish the desired point.  But their
labor was vain; and they began to despair of success,
when the genius who struck out the frolic happily suggest.
ed the means of performing it.
A man was despatched to the city for a paper kite.  The
inhabitants were by this time apprised of what was going
forward, and flocked in crowds to be witnesses of. the
address and boldness of the English.  The governor of
Alexandria was told that those seamen were about to pull
down Pompey's Pillar.  But whether he gave them  credit
for their respect to the Roman warrior,* or to the Turkish
goverunment, he left them  to themselves, and politely answered, that the English were too great patriots to injure
the- remains of Pompey. He knew little, however, of the
disposition of the people who were engaged in this under*Pron, war'-yft.
Lesson 20.]taking.  Had the Turkish empire risen in opposition, it
would not at, that moment have deterred them.
The kite was brought, and flown so directly over the pillar, that wh-en it fell on the other side, the string loldged
upon the capital.'ile chief obstacle was now overcome.
A two-inich rope was tied to one end of the strinrg, and drawn
over the pillar by the er.d to which t}-e kite was affixed.
By this rope one of thle seamen ascended to the top; a'rl in
less thaan an hour a kind of shroud was constructed, -y
which the whole company went up, and dranlk their p::lr,h
amid the shouts of the astonishedn multitude.  Tro the eye
below, the capital of the pillar does not appear capable of
holding, more than one mart upon it; but our seamen found
it could contain no less than eight persons very conlvenientlv.
It is astonishing that no accident befell these inadcaps, in
a situation so elevated, that it would have turned a landnldl giddy in his sober senses. The only detriment which
the pillar received, was the loss of the volute before mentioned, which came down with a thundering sound, and was
carried to England by one of the captains, as a present to a
lady who had commissioned him  for a piece of the pillar.
The discovery which they made amply compensated for
this mischief; as, without their evidence, the world would
not have known at this hour that there was originally a
statue on this pillar, one foot and ancle of which are still
remaining.  The statue must have been  of a gigantic
size, to have appeared of a man's proportion at so great a
height.
There are circumstances in this story which might give it
an air of fiction, were it not authenticated beyond all doubt.
Besides the testimonies of many eye-witnesses, the adventurers themselves have left us a token of the fact, by the initials of their names, which are very legible in black paint
just beneath the capital.

Interesting account of William  Penn's treaty with the American Indians, previous to his settling in Pennsylvania.EDINBU1G1H REEVIEW.
THE country assigned to him by the royal charter was yet
full of its original inhabitants; and the principles of Wil[Lesson 21.
60
THE AMERICANliam Penn did not allow him to look upon that gift as a
warrant to dispossess the first proprietors of the land. He
had accordingly appointed his commissioners, the preceding
year, to treat with them for the fair purchase of a part of
their lands, and for their joint possession of the remainder;
and the terms of the settlement being now nearly agreed
upon, he proceeded, very soon after his arrival, to conclude
the settlement, and solemnly to pledge his faith, and to ratify and confirm the treaty in sight both of the Indians and
planters.
For this purpose, a grand convocation of the tribes had
been appointed near the spot where Philadelphia now
stands; and it was agreed that he and the presiding Sachems should meet and exchange faith, under the spreading branches of a prodigious elm-tree, that grew on the
bank of the river. On the day appointed, accordingly, an
innumerable multitude of the Indians assembled in that
neighborhood; and were seen, with their dark visages and
brandished arms, rnoving, in vast swarms, in the depth of
the woods which then overshaded the whole of that now
cultivated region.
On the other hand, William Penn, with a moderate attendance of friends, advanced to meet them.  He came of
course unarmed-in his usual plain dress--vithout banners,
or mace, or guard, or carriages; and only distinguished
from his companions by wearing a blue sash of silk network (which it seems is still preserved by Mr. Kett of Seething-hall, near Norwich,) and by having in his hand a roll
of parchment, on which was engrossed the confirmation of
the treaty of purchase and amity.  As soon as he drew
near the spot where the Sachems were assembled, the
whole multitude of Indians threw down their weapons, and
seated themselves on the ground in groups; each under his
ow\n chieftain; and the presiding chief intimated to William
Penn, that the nations were ready to hear him.
Having been thus called upon, he began: "The Great
Spirit," he said, " who made him and them, who ruleth the
heaven and the earth, and who knew the innermost thoughts
of man, knew that he and his friends had a hearty desire
to live in peace and friendship with them, and to serve them
to the utmost of their powver.  It was not their custom to
use hostile weapons against their fellow-creatures, for which
reason they had come unarmed.  Their object was not to do
injury, and thus provoke the Great Spirit, but to do good.
Lesson o1.]
61
FIRST CLASS BOOK.They were then met on the broad pathway of goud faith
and good will, so that no advantage was to be taken on either
side, but all was to be openness, brotherhood, and love."
After these and other words, he unrolled the parchment,
and, by means of the same interpreter, conveyed to them,
article by article, the conditions of the purchase, and the
words of the compact then made for their eternal union.
Among other things, they were not to be molested in their
lawful pursuits even in the territory they had alienated, for
it was to be. common to them and- the English.  They were
to have the same liberty to do all things therein relating to
the improvement of their grounds, and the providing of sustenance for their families, which the English had.  If any
disputes should arise between the two, they should be set-. tied by twelve persons, half of whom should be English,
and half Indians.
He then paid them for the land, and made them  many
presents besides from  the merchandise which had been
spread before them.  Having done this, he laid the roll
of parchment on the ground, observing again, that the
ground should be common to both people. He then added,
that he would not do as the Marylanders did, that is, call
them Children or Brothers only; for often parents were apt
to whip their children too severely, and brothers sometimes
would differ; neither would he compare the friendship between him aild them to a chain, for the rain might sometimes rust it, or a tree might fall and break it; but he
should consider them as the same flesh and blood with the
Christians, and the same as if one mar's body were to be
divided into two parts. He then took up the parchment, and
presented it to the Sachem who wore the horn in the chaplet, and desired him and the other Sachems to preserve it
carefully for three generations, that their children might
know what had passed between them, just as if he himself
had remained with them to repeat it.
The Indians, in return, made long and stately harangues
-of which, however, no more seems to have been reinembered, but that "they pledged themselves to live in love
wi,th William Penn and his children, as long as the sun and
moon should endure."  And thus ended this famous treaty;
-of which Voltaire has remarked, with so much truth and
severity, "that it was the only one ever concluded between
savages and Christians that was not ratified by an oath--
and the only one that never was broken!"

LESSON  XXII,
Visit to the falls of Missouri.-EDINBURGH REVIEW.
As Captains Lewis and Clarke approached-the mountains, and had got considerably beyond the walls already
described, at the meridian nearly of 1100, and the parallel
of about 47~ 20', the same almost as that of the station of
the Mandans, there was a bifurcation of the river, which
threw them into considerable doubt as to which was the
true Missouri, and the course which it behooved them to
pursue.  The northernmost possessed most strongly the
characters of that river, and the men seemed all to entertain no doubt that it was the stream wvhich they ought
to follow.
The commanders of the expedition, however, did not decide, till after they had reconnoitred the country from the
higher grounds, and then determined to follow the southern
branch.  On the eleventh of June, 1S06, Capt. Lewis set
out on foot with four men, in order to explore this river.
They proceeded till the 13th, when, finding that the river
ore considerably to the south, fearing that they were in an
lesson 22.]
6-3~
FIRST CLASS BOOK.error, they changed their course, and proceeded across the
plain.
In this direction Captain Lewis had gone about two miles,
when his ears were saluted witll the agreeable sound of a
fall of water; and as he advanced, a spray, which seemed
driven by the high southwest wind, rose above the plain like
a colfimn of smoke, and vanished in an instant.   Towards
this point, he directed his steps; and the noise, increasing
as he approached, soon became too tremendous to be mistaken
for any thing but the great falls of the Missouri.
Having travelled seven miles after hearing the sound, he
reached the falls about 12 o'clock.  The hills, as he approached, were difficult of access', and about 200 feet high.
Down these he hurried with impatience; and seating himself on some rocks under the centre of the falls, he enjoyed
the sublime spectacle of this stupendous cataract, which,
since the creation, had been lavishing its magnificence on
the desert.
These falls extend, in all, over a distance of nearly twelve
miles; and the medium  breadth of the river varies from
300 to 600 yards.   The principal fall is near the lower extreinity, and is upwards of 80 feet perpendicular.   The
river is here nearly 300 yards wide, with perpendicular cliffs
on each side, not less than 100 feet high. For 90 or 100
yards from the left cliff, the water falls in one smooth, even
sheet, over a precipice at least 80 feet high. The remaining
part of the river precipitates itself also with great rapidity;
but being received, as it falls, by irregular and projecting
rocks, form a splendid prospect of white foam, 200 yards
in length, and 80 in perpendicular elevation.
The spray is dissipated in a thousand shapes, flying up in
high columns, and collecting into large masses, which the
sun adorns with all the coloring of the rainbow.   The fall,
just described, must be one of the most macgnificent and picturesque that is any where to be found.  It has often been
disputed, whether a cataract, in which the water falls in o-ne
sheet, or one where it is dashed irregularly among the ro(ks,
is the finer object.  It was reserved for the Missouri to resolve this doubt, by exhibiting both at once in the greatest
magnificence.
There is another cascade, of about 47 feet, higher up the
river, and the last of all is 26 feet; but the succession of
inferior falls, and of rapids of very great declivity, is astonishingly great; so that, from the first to the last, the
64
[Lesson 22.whole descent of the river is 384 feet.--"Just below the
falls," say's Captain Lewis, "is a little island in the river,
well covered vith timber. Here, on a cotton-wood tree,
an eagle had fixed his nest, and seemed the undisputed mistress of a spot, to invade which neither man nor beast could
venture across the gulf that surrounds it; while it is farther secured by the mist that rises from the falls. This solitary bird has not escaped the observation of the Indians,
who made the eagle's nest a part of their description of the
falls which they gave us, and which proves now  to be correct in almost every particular, except that they did not do
justice to their height."
The river above the falls is quite unruffled and smooth,
with numerous herds of buffaloes feedingf on the plains
around it. These plains open out on both sides, so that it
is not improbable that they mark the bottom of an ancient
lake, the outlet of which the river is still in the act of cutting down, and will squire many ages to accomplish its
work, or to reduce the whole to a moderate and uniform
declivity. The eagle may then be dispossessed of her ancient and solitary domain.

FIRST CLASS BOOK.THIS book has been compiled with a special reference to the puLlic
Reading and Grammar Schools of this city. It is the result of an.ttempt to
supply the want--which has long been a subject of compiaint anmong thos.3
whom the citizens of Boston ha-e charged with the general superint.endence
of their public schools, as well as with those who are appointed to the ilrr;ediate instructioin of them-of a book of Exercist-- in Reading and Speaking
better adapted, than ally English conipilation that has yet appeared, to the
state of society as it is in this country; and less obnoxious to complaint, on
the ground of its national )r political character, than it is reasonable to expect that any English com ilation would be, among a people whose manners,
f,pinions, literary institutii ns, and civil government, are so strictly republhcan
as our own.
But, though the immediate design of this compilation was a limited and
local one, it has been borne in mind, throughout the work, that the want,
which has beoet a subject of complaiiit in this city, must have been still more
widely felt; especially by those, in every part of our country, who are attentive to the national, moral, and religious sentiments, containeJ in the books
that are used by their children while learnino to read, and while their literary
taste is beginning to assume something of tm e character which it ever afterwards retains.
How far the objections, which have been made to cither works of this
sort, have been obviated in the present selection, it is for others to determine.
I willingly leave the decision of this question to the ultimate and only proper
tribunal--the public; to whose kindness, as shown towards one of my
eforts, in another department of literature, i am no stranger, and for which
I should prove myself ungratefiul should I not acknowledge my obligation.-1
only hope that the kindness-of the public towards the past, may not have led
me into presumption and carelessness in regard to the present.
In as much, however, as this book departs, in some particulars, from most
others of the same general character, it may be expected that the author
should assign his reasons for such deviations. These relate principally to
the omission of some things that are usually deemed essential to a schoolreader; and to the arrangement of the materials of which this is made up.
First, then, it may be urged as an objection to this, as a compilation that is
to be used by those who are learning to read, that it consists entirely of exercises in reading and speaking, to the exclusion of those rules, the knowledge
of which is indisrensable to any considerable proficieney in either.
I have observed, however, that that part of school-books which consists of
Brief Treatises upon Rhetoric, Rules for Reading, and Essays on Elocution,
is, almost uniformly, little worn:-an evidence that it is little used; in other
words, that it is of little use. I have construed this fact into an oracular
monition not to devote to such Rules, Treatises, or Essays, any part of the
present work.
Tue truth probibly is, that reading, like conversation, is learned from example rather than by rule.--No one becomes distinguished, as a singer, by uiea
most familiar knowledge of the gamut so, no one is ever made aa accomplished reader or speaker by studying rules for elocution, even though aidedBreathe per'fumes exquisite. Expect it not,
Ye who till noon upon a down-bed lie,
Indulging feverish sleep, or, wakeful, dream
Of happiness no mortal heart has felt,
But in the regions of romance'. Ye fair,
Like you it must be wooed or never won,
And, being lost, it is in vain ye ask
For milk of roses and Olympian dew.
Cosmetic art no tincture can afford,
The faded features to restore: no chain,
Be it of gold, and strong as adamant,
Can fetter beauty to the fair one's will.

THE meek-eyed morn appears, mother of dews,
At first faint gleaming in the dappled east:
Till far o'er ether spreads the widening glow;
And, from before tne lustre of her face,
White break the clouds awav. With quickened step,
Browvn Night retires: Young Day pours in apace,
And opens all:the lawny prospect wide.
The dripping rock, the mountain's misty top,
Swell on the sight, and brighten with the dawn.
Blue, through the dusk, the smoking currents shine;
And from the bladed field the fearful hare
Limps awkward: while along the forest glade
The wild deer trip, and often, turning, gaze
At early passenger. Music awakes
The native voice of undissembled joy;
And thick around the woodland hymns arise.
Rous'd by the cock, the soon-clad shepherd leaves
His mossy cottage, where with Peace he dwells:
And from the crowded fold, in order, drives
His flock, to taste the verdure of the morn.
Falsely luxurious, will not Man awake;
And, springing from the bed of sloth, enjoy
The cool, the fragrant, and the silent hour,
To meditation due and sacred song?
For is there aught in sleep can charm the wise?
To lie in dead oblivion, losing halfThe fleeting moments of too short a life;
Total extinction of the enlightened soul!
Or else to feverish vanity alive,
Wildered, and tossing through distempered dreams?
Who would in such a gloomy state remain
Longer than Nature craves; when every Muse,
And every blooming pleasure wait without,
To bless the wildly devious morning walk?
But yonder comes the powerful King of Day,
Rejoicing in the east. The lessening cloud,
The kindling azure, and the mountain's brow
Illumed with fluid gold, his near approach
Betoken glad. Lo, now, apparent all,
Aslant the dew-bright earth, and colored air,
He looks in boundless majesty abroad,
And sheds the shining day, that burnished plays
On rocks, and hills, and towers, and wandering streams
High-gleaming from afar. Prime cheerer, Light!
Of all material beings first, and best!
Efflux divine! Nature's resplendent robe!
Without whose vesting beauty all were wrapt
In unessential gloom; and thou, 0 Sun!
Soul of surrounding worlds! in whom best seen
Shines out thy Maker! may I sing of thee?'Tis by thy secret, strong, attractive force,
As with a chain indissoluble bounld,
Thy system rolls entire; from the far bourn
Of utmost Saturn, wheeling wide his round
Of thirty years, to Mercury, whose disk
Can scarce be caught by philosophic eye,
Lost in the near effulgence of thy blaze.
Informer of the planetary train!
Without whose quickening glance their cumbrous orbs
WVere brute unlovely mass, inert and dead,
And not, as now, the green abodes of life;
How many forms of being wait on thee,
Inhaling spirit, from the unfettered mind,
By thee sublimed, down to the daily race,
The mixing myriads of thy setting beam.
The vegetable world is also thine,
Parent of Seasons! who the pomp precede
That waits thy throne, as through thy vast domain
Annual, along the bright ecliptic road,
In world-rejoicing state, it moves sublime.Mean-tlnme the expecting nations, circled gay
With all the various tribes of isodful earth,
Implore thy bounty, or send grateful up
A common hymn; while, round thy beaming car,
High-seen, the Seasons lead, in sprightly dance
Harmonious knit, the rosy-fingered Hours,
The Zephyrs floating loose, the timely Rains,
Of bloom ethereal, the light-footed Dews,
And, softened into joy, the surly Storms.
These, in successive turn, with lavish hand,
Shower every beauty, every fragrance shower,
Herbs, flowers, and fruits; till, kindling at thy touch,
From land to land is flushed the vernal year.

Importance of Literature.-LoRD LYTTLETON.
CADMUS AND HERCULES.
Hercules.
Do you pretend to sit as high on Olympus as Hercules? Did you kill the Nemoe'an lion, the Erymanthian boar,
the Lernean serpent, and Stymphalian birds? Did you destroy tyrants and robbers? You value yourself greatly on
subduing one serpent: I did as much as that while I lay in
my cradle.
Cadmus. It is not on account of the serpent, that I boast
myself a greater benefactor to Greece than you. Actions
should be valued by their utility, rather than their splendor. I taught Greece the art of writing, to which laws
owe their precision and permanency. You subdued monsters; I civilized men. It is from untamed passions, not
from wild beasts, that the greatest evils arise to human society. By wisdom, by art, by the united strength of a civil
community, men have been enabled' to subdue the whole
race of lions, bears, and serpents; and, what is more, to
bind by laws and wholesome regulations, the ferocious violence and dangerous treachery of the human disposition.
Had lions been destroyed only in single combat,* men had
had but a bad time of it; and what, but laws, could awe the
men who killed the lions?  The genuine glory, the proper
distinction of the rational species, arises from the perfectiou

THE AMERICANof the mental powers. Courage is apt to be fierce, and
strength is often exerted in acts of oppression: but wisdom
is the associate of justice. It assists her to form equal laws,
to pursue right measures, to correct power, protect wveakness, and to unite individuals in a common interest and general welfare.  Heroes may kill t-yrants, but it is wisdom and
laws that prevent tyranny and oppression.'The;operations
of policy far surpass:the labors of Hercules, preventing
many evils which valor and might cannot even redress.
You heroes regard nothing but glory; and scarcely consider whether the conquests, which raise your fame, are
really beneficial to your country. Unhappy are the people
who are governed by valor not directed by prudence, and
not mitigated by the gentle arts!
Hercules. I do not expect to find an admirer of my strenuous life, in the man who taught his countrymen to sit still
and read; and to lose the hours of youth and action in idle
speculation and the sport of words.
Cadmus. An ambition to have a place in the registers of
fame, is the Eurystheus which imposes heroic labors on
mankind.  The Muses incite to action, as well as entertain
the hours of repose; and I think you should honor them
for presenting to heroes so noble a recreation, as may prevent their taking up the distaff, when they lay down the
club.
Hercules. Wits as well as heroes can take up the distaff.
What think you of their thin-spun systems of philosophy, or
lascivious poems, or Milesian fables?  Nay, what is still
worse, are there not panegyrics* on tyrants, and books that
blaspheme the gods, and perplex the natural sense of right
and wrong? I believe if Eurystheus were to set me to work
again, he would find me a worse task than any he imposed;
he would make me read over a great library; and I would
serve it as I did the Hydra, I would burn as I went on, that
one chimera might not rise from another, to plague mankind. I should have valued myself more on clearing the
library, than on cleansing the Augean stables.
Cadinus. It is in those libraries only that the memory of
your labor exists. The heroes of Marathon, the pitriots
of Thermopyla, owe their fame to me. All the wise institutions of lawgivers, and all the dcoctrines of sages, had per
isbed in the ear, like a dream related, if letters had not
preserved them. O Hercules! it is not for the man who
preferred Virtue to Pleasure, to be an enemy to the Muses$

69Let Sardanapilus and the silken sons of luxury, who have
wasted life in inglorious ease, despise the records of action,
which bear no honorable testimony to their lives: but true
merit, heroic virtue,'should respect the sacredl source of
lasting honor.
Hercules. Indeed, if writers employed themselves only in
recording the acts of great men, mriuch might be said in their
favor. But why do they trouble people with their medita.
tions? Can it be of any consequence to the world what an
idle man has been thinking?
Cadmus. Yes it may. The most important and extensive
advantages mankind enjoy, are greatly owing to men who
have never quitted their closets. To  them mankind are
obliged for the facility and security of navigation. The inr
vention of the compass has opened to them new worlds.
The knowlodge of the mechanical powers has enabled them
to construct such wonderful machines, as perform what the
united labor of millions, by the severest drudgery, could
not accomplish. Agriculture too, the most useful of arts,
has received its share of improvement from the same source.
Poetry, likewise, is of excellent use, to enable the memory
to retain with more ease, and to imnprint with more energy
upon the heart, precepts and examples of virtue. From the
]ittle root of a few letters, science has spread its branches
over all nature, and raised its head to the heavens. Some
philosophers have entered so far into the counsels of Divine
Wisdo.m, as to explain much of the great operations of nature. The dimensions and distances of the planets, the
causes of their revolutions, the path of comets, and the ebbing and flowing of tides, are understood and explained. Can
any thing raise the glory of the human species more, than
to see a little creature, inhabiting a small spot, amidst innumerable worlds, taking a survey of the universe, comprehending its arrangement, and entering into the scheme of
that wonderful connexion and correspondence of things so
remote, and which it seems a great exertion of Omnipotence
to have established? What a volume of wisdom, what a noble theology, do these discoveries open to us!  While some
superior geniuses have soared to these sublime subjects,
other sagacious and diligent minds have been inquiring into
the most minute works of the Infinite Artificer: the same
care, the same providence, is exerted through the whole;.and we should learn from it, that, to true wisdom, utility and
fitness appear perfection, and whatever is beneficial is noble,

[Lesson 25. -
THIE ASIERICANHercules. I approve of science as far as it is assistant to
action.  I like the improvement of navigation, and the discovery of the greater part of the globe, because it opens a
wider field for the master spirits of the world to bustle in.
Cadmus. There spoke the soul of Hercules. But if
learned men are to be esteemed for the assistance they give
to active minds in their schemes, they are not less to be
valued for their endeavors to give them  a right direction,
and moderate their too great ardor. The study of history
will teach the legislator by what means states have become
powerful; and in the private citizen, they will inculcate the
love of liberty and order. The writings of sages point out
a private path of virtue; and show that the best empire is
self-government, and that subduing our passions is the noblest of conquests.
Hercules. The true spirit of heroism  acts by a generous
impulse, and wants neither the experience of history, nor
the doctrines of philosophers to direct it.  But do not arts
and science render men effeminate, luxurious, and inactive?
and can you deny that wit and learning are often made subservient to very bad purposes?
Cadrnus. I will own that there are some natures so happily formed, they scarcely want the assistance of a master,
and the rules of art, to give them force or grace in every
thing they do.  But these favored geniuses are few.  As
learning flourishes only where ease, plenty, and mild government subsists; in so rich a soil, and under so soft a climate,
the weeds of luxury will spring up among the flowers of
art: but the spontaneous weeds would grow more rank, if
they were allowed the undisturbed possession of the field.
L.etters keep a frugal, temperate nation from  growing ferocious, a rich one from  becoming entirely sensual and de.
bauched.  Every gift of Heaven is sometimes abused; but
good sense and fine talents, by a natural law, gravitate towards virtue. Accidents may drive, them out of their proper direction; but such accidents are an alarming omen, and
of dire portent' to the times.  For if virtue cannot keep to
her allegiance those men, who in their hearts confess her
divine right, and know  the value of her laws, on whose
fidelity and obedience can she depend?  May such geniuses
never descend to flatter vice, encourage folly, or propagate
irreligion; but exert all their powers'in the service of VirttLe, and celebrate the noble choice of those, Twho, like Herc-les, preferremi  hei to Pleasure!

0)n the pZeasure of acquiring knowledge.-ALIsoN.
IN every period of life, the acqu3'ition of knowledge is
one of the most pleasing employments of the human mind.
But in y3utll, there are circumstances whi;h make it productive of higher enjoyment. It is then tLat every thing
has the charm  of novelty; that curiosity and fancy are
awake; and that the heart swells with the anticipations of
future eminence and utility. Even in those lower branches
of instruction which we call mere accomplishments, there
is something always pleasing to the young in their acquisition. They seem to become every well-educated person,
they adorn, if they do not dignify humanity; and, what is
far more, while they give an elegant employment to the
hours of leisure* and relaxation, they afford a means of contributing to the purity and innocence of domestic life.
But in the acquisition of knowledge of the higher kind,In the hours when the young gradually begin the study of
the laws of nature, and of the faculties of the human mind
or of the magnificent revelations of the Gospel,--there is
a pleasure of a sublimer nature.  The cloud, which, in their
infant years, seemed to cover nature from their view, begins
gradually to resolve. The world in which they are placed
opens with all its wonders upon their eye; their powers of
attention and observation seem to expand with the scene before them; and, while they see, for the first time, the immensity of the universe of God, and mrark the majestic
simplicity of those laws by which its operations are conducted, they feel as if they were awakened to a higher species of being, and admitted into nearer intercourse with
the Author of Nature.
It is this period, accordingly, more than all others, that
determines our hopes or fears of the future fate of the young.
To feel no joy in such pursuits;-to listen carelessly to the
voice vwhich brings such magnificent instruction;--to see the
veil raised which conceals the counsels of the Deity, and to
show no emotion at the discovery, are symptoms of a weakl
and torpid spirit,-of' a mind unworthy of the advantages
it possesses, and fitted only for the humility of sensual
and ignoble  pleasure.  Of those, on  the contrary, who
distinguish themselves by the love of knowledge,-who folow with ardor the career that is open to them, we are
apt to form the most honorable prSs'ages.  It is the char* Pron. 1'-zhlure.

[Lesson 2f
THE AMERICANacter which is natural to youth, and which, therefore, promises well of their maturity.  We foresee for them, at least, a
life of pure and virtuous enjoyment, and we are willing to anticipate no common share of future usefulness and splendor.
In the  second place, the pursuits of knowledge  lead
not only to happiness, but to honor.  "Length of days
is in her right hand, and in her left are riches and honor.'
It is honorable to excel even in the most trifling species
of knowledge, in those which can amuse only the passing
hour.  It is more honorable to excel in those difl'erent
branches of science which are connected with the liberal
professions of life, and which tend so much to the dignity
and well-being of humanity.  It is the means of raising the
most obscure to esteem  and attentiori; it opens to the just
ambition of youth, some of the most distinguished and respected situations in society; and it places them there, with
the consoling reflection, that it is to their own industry and
labor, in the providence of God, that they are alone indebted for them.  But, to excel in the higher attainments of
knowledge,-to be distinguished in those greater pursuits
which have commanded the attention and exhausted the
abilities of the wise in every former age,-is, perhaps, of all
the distinctions of human understanding, the most honorable and grateful.
When we look back upon the great men who have gone
before us in every path of glory, we feel our eye turn from
the career of war and ambition, and involuntarily  rest
upon those who have displayed the great truths of religion,
who have investigated the laws of social welfare, or extended the. sphere of human knowledge.  These are honors,
we feel, vwhich have been gained without a crime, and which
can be enjoyed without remorse.  They are honors also
which call never die,-which can shed lustre even upon the
humblest head,-and to which the young of every succeeding age will look up, as their brightest incelltives to the pursuit of virtuous fame.
LESSON XXVII.
On the uses of knowcledge.-ALIsoN.
T'HE first end to which all wisdom or knowledge ought
to be employed, is to illustrate the wisdom or goodness of
the Father of Nature.  Every science that is cultivated oy
7
Lesson 27.1
73men, leads naturally to religious thought, from the study of
the plant that grows beneath our feet, to that of the Host
of Heaven above us, who perform their stated revolutions
in majestic silence, amid the expanse of infinity. When,
in the youth of Moses, " the Lord appeared to him in Horeb," a voice was heard, saying, "draw  nigh hither, and
put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place where thou
standest is holy ground." It is with such a reverential awe
that every great or elevated mind will approach to the study
of nature, and with such feelings of adoration and gratitude,
that he will receive the illumination that gradually opens
upon his soul.
It is not the lifeless mass of matter, he will then feel, that
he is examining,-it is the mighty machine of Eternal Wisdom: the workmanship of Him, " in whom  every thing
lives, and moves, and has its being."  Under an aspect of
this kind, it is impossible to pursue knowledge without mingling with it the most elevated sentiments of devotion;-it is
impossible to perceive the laws of nature without perceiving, at the same time, the presence and the Providence of
the Lawgiver:--and thus it is, that, in every age, the evidences of religion have advanced with the progress of true
philosophy; and that science, in erecting a monument to
herself, has, at the same time, erected an altar to the Deity.
The knowledge of nature is not exhausted. There are
many great discoveries yet awaiting the labors of science;
and with them, there are also awaiting to humanity many
additional proofs of the wisdom  and benevolence "of Him:
that made us." To the hope of these great discoveries,
few, indeed, can pretend:-yet let it ever be remembered,
that he who can trace any one new fact, or can exemplify
any one new instance of divine wisdom or benevolence in
the system  of nature, has not lived in vain; that he has
added to the sum of human knowledge; and, what is far
more, that he has added to the evidence of those greater
truths, upon which the happiness of time and eternity deopends.
The second great end to which all knowledge ought to
be employed, is to the welfare of humanity.  Every sc]ence
is the foundation of some art, beneficial to men; and while
the study of it leads us to see the beneficence of the laws
of Rature, it calls upon us also to follow the great end of
the Father of Nature m their employment and application
I need not say wnat a field is thus opened to, the benevolence of knowledge: I need not tell you, that in every department of learning there is good to be done to mankind'
I need not remind you, that the age in which we live hat
given us the noblest examples of this kind, and that science
now finds its highest glory in improving the condition, or iN
allaying the miseries of humanity.  But there is one thing of
which it is proper ever to remind you, because the modesty
of knowledge often leads us to forget it,-and that is, that.the power of scientific benevolence is far greater than that
of all others, to the welfare of society.
The benevolence of the great, or the opulent, however
eminent it may be, perishes with themselves. The benevo
lence even of sovereigns is limited to the narrow boundary
of human life; and, not unfrequently, is succeeded by different and discordant counsels. But the benevolence of knowledge is of a kind as extensive as the race of man, and as
permanent as the existence of society. He, in whatever
situation he may be, who, in the study of science, has discovered a new means of alleviating pain, or of remedying
disease; who has described a wiser method of preventing
poverty, or of shielding misfortune; who has suggested additional means of increasing or improving the beneficent
productions of nature, has left a memorial of himself, which
can never be forgotten; which will communicate happiness to ages yet unborn; and which, in the emphatic language of scripture, renders him a " fellow-worker" with God
himself, in the improvement of his Creation.
The third great end of all knowledge is the improvement
and exaltation of our own minds. It was the voice of the
apostle, " What manner of men ought ye to be, to whom the
truths of the Gospel have come?" It is the voice of nature also, " What manner of men ought ye to be, to whom
the treasures of wisdom are opened?" Of all the spectacles, indeed, which life can offer us, there is none more
painful, or unnatural, than that of the union of vice with
knowledge. It counteracts the great designs of God in the
distribution of wisdom; and it assimilates men, not to the
usual characters of human frailty, but to those dark and
malignant spirits who fell from Heaven, and who excel in'
knowledge, only that they may employ it in malevolence:
To the wise and virtuous man, on the contrary -to him
whose moral attainments have kept pace with h, ntellec.
tual, and who has employed the great talent with which he
is entrusted to the glory of God, and to the good of humna.

which all rules must be expressed--what is meant by a rapid or deliberaite
enunciation; what by speaking loudly or softly, on a high or low key, with
emphasis or in a monotoely, distinctly or iiindistiiictly.  We  limay anluse ours,'ves, if we please, with laying down rules upon these matters, but, till our
ru.es are illustrated by the voice and manner of a good reader. they are
totally inoperative; and, when thus illustrated, totally utlnecessary.  T'he
learnler imitates the example of reading which is given in explaining a rule,
allt( the rule itself is forsaken and soon forgotten.
It seems to me that the reatliest, in(feed the only good way, to teach children to read well, is, to give them  to the!,ar;-e of in:tt. cters who are themselves ge-od readers;--instructers, who, like teachers of miusic, will not content themselves with laying certain rules for regul Ating the tones, inflexious
and cadences of the voice before your child's eye, X'hich call neither receive
a souind nor give one, but who will address his ear with living instruction,with the rich and informing nlelody of the human voice.
Secondly,-in regard to the arransfernent of the lessons: a different course
has been pursued fiom that which has been usually followed in compilations
of this ikind.
By devoting fifty or more pages, in succession, to lessons of any one kind,
whether narrative, didactic, or descriptive; then putting together all the
dramatic pieces; then giving, in an unbroken series, all the specimens of
eloquence from the senate, the pulpit, and the bar; and then, making the
young literary pilgrirn travel over many days' journey of poetry, albeit unsmitten with the love of song, and undesirous of being "wedded to imnmortal verse"
-we may, indeed, secure to ourselves the credit of methodical arrangement;
but we shall be sure to make few friends, either ameng teachers or learners;among masters, who are not displeased with a little variety in their exercises,
or among' scholars, who must have it.
By a severe method, in the arrangement of reading lessons, the teacher:is
compelled to consult his own comnfort, and to keep alive tile interest of his
scholars, by frequently skippi,ng from one part of the book to another; the consequence of which is, either that those pieces only are read which happen to be
favorites, and those are so constantly read that they come ere long to b)e rehearsed almost by rote, and, therefore, with little thought and little improvement; or, if the master determines that, at all events, the book shall be resolutely read through in course, the conlsequence is that the children soon get
heartily tired of it, while the poor man canmot find it in his heart to blame
them, for he is heartily tired of it hiniself.
With a view to obviate this difficulty, I have studiously avoided that method
which to some may seem indispensable to the reputation of every literary work,
and have been governed by considerations of practical utility, in so arrangingl
the following lessons that they may be read in course, and at the same time
present that variety, in the frequent alternation of prose and poetry, and the
conistaint succession of different subjects in each, which will relieve both
learner anid teacher from that sameness, which makes it an irksome task to
either give or receive instruction.
It vwill be perceived, however, that I have not been entirely unmindful
of method. I have endeavored to consult the capacity of the scholar, and to
provide fbr his gradually increasing strength), by giving the precedence, in'V                  THE AMERICAN              [Lesson 28.
ity,--are presented the sublimest prospects that mortality
can know. " In my father's house," says our Savior, "are
many mansions;"-mansions, we may dare to interpret, fitted to the different powers that life has acquired, and to the
uses to which they have been applied.
Of that great scene, indeed, which awaits all, whether
ignorant or wise, it becomes us to think with reverential
awe. Yet we know, " that it will then be well with the
good, though it will not be well with the wicked;" and we
are led, by an instinctive anticipation, to suppose that they
who here have excelled in wisdom and benevolence, will be
rewarded with higher objects, upon which they may be employed, and admitted into nearer prospects of the government of Eternal Wisdom. "In his light they shall see
light."  " They shall see Him, not as through a glass,
darkly; but as he is.  They  shall know, even as they
themselves are known."
LESSON XXVIII.,No life pleasing to God, t,hat is not useful to mnan:-An eas
tern narrative.-HAWKESWORTH.
IT pleased our nmighty sovereign, Abbas Carascan, from
whom the kings of the earth derive honor and dominion, to
set Mirza his servant over the province of Tauris. In the
hand of Mirza, the balance of distribution was suspended
with impartiality; and under his administration the weak
were protected, the learned received honor, and the diligent became rich: Mirza, therefore, was beheld by every
eye with complacency, and every tongue pronounced blessings upon his head. But it was observed that he derived.
no joy from the benefits which he diffused; he became pensive and melancholy; he spent his leisure in solitude; in
his palace he sat motionless upon a sofa; and when he went
out, his walk was slow, and his eyes were fixed upon the
ground: he applied to the business of state with reluctance;
and resolved to relinquish the toil of government, of which
he could no longer enjoy the reward.
He, therefore, obtained permission to approach the throne
of our sovereign; and being asked what was his request, he
made this reply: "May the Lord of the world forgive the
slave whom he has honored, if Mirza presume again to lay
py  
--the bounty of Abbas at his feet. Thou hast given me the
dominion of a country, fruitful as the gardens of Damascus;
and a city glorious above all others, except that only which
reflects the splendor of thy presence. But the longest life
is a period scarcely sufficient to prepare for death. All
other business is vain and trivial, as the toil of emmets in
the path of the traveller, under whose foot they perish forever: and all enjoyment is unsubstantial and evanescent as
the colors of the bow that appears in the interval of a
storm. Suffer me, therefore, to prepare for the approach
of eternity; let me give up my soul to meditation; let solitude and silence acquaint me with the mysteries of devotion;
let mre forget the world, and by the world be forgotten, till
the moment arrives in which the veil of eternity shall fall,
and I shall be found at the bar of the Almighty."  Mirza
then bowed himself to the earth, and stood silent.
By the command of Abbas it is recorded, that at these
words he trembled upon the throne, at the footstool of
which the world pays homage; he looked round upon his
nobles; but every countenance was pale, and every eye was
upon the earth. No man opened his mouth; and the king
first broke silence, after it had continued near an hour.
"Mirza, terror and. doubt are come upon nle. I am
alarmed as a man who suddenly perceives that he is near
the brink of a precipice, and is urged forward by an irresistible force: but yet I know not whether my danger is a
realitv or a dream. I am as thou art, a reptile of the earth:
my life is a moment, and eternity, in which days, and years,
and ages, are nothing, eternity is before me, for which I also
should prepare: but by whom, then, must the faithful be
governed? By those only, who have no fear of judgment?
by those only, whose life is brutal, because like brutes they
do not consider that they shall die? Or who, indeed, are the
faithful? Are the busy multitudes that crowd the city, in a
state of perdition i? and is the cell of the Dervise alone the
gate of paradise? To all, the life of a Dervise is not possible: to all, therefore, it cannot be a duty. Depart to the
house which has in this city been prepared for thy residence: I wiil meditate the reason of thy request; and may
He who illuminates the mind of the humble, enable me to
determine with wisdom."
Mirza departedl; and on the third day, having received
no command, he again requested an audience, and it was
granted.  VWhen he entered the royal presence, his counte-?~*
lenosn 28.3nance appeared more cheerful; he drew a letter from his
bosom, and having kissed it, he presented it with his right
hand. "My Lord!" said he, "I have learned by this letter, which I received from Cosrou the Iman, who stands now
before thee, in what manner life may be best improved. I
am enabled to look back with pleasure, and forward with
hope; and I shall now rejoice still to be the shadow of thy
power at Tauris, and to keep those honors which I so
lately wished to resign." The king, who had listened to
Mirza with a mixture of surprise and curiosity, immediately
gave the letter to Cosrou, and commanded that it should be
read.  The eyes of the court were at once turned upon the
hoary sage, whose countenance was suffused with an honest
blush; and it was not without some hesitation that he read
these words.                              t'
" To Mirza, whom  the wisdom of Abbas our mighty lord
has honored with dominion, be perpetual health! When
I heard thy purpose to withdraw the blessings of thy government from the thousands of Tauris, my heart was wounded with the arrow of affliction, and my eyes became dim with
sorrow. But who shall speak before the king when he is
troubled; and who shall boast of knowledge when he is
distressed by doubt? To thee will 1 relate the events of my
youth, which thou hast renewed before me; and those
truths which they taught me,"may the prophet multiply
to thee!
" Under the instruetion ~f the physician Aluzar, I obtained
an early knowedge of his art. To those who were smitten
with disease,4I, Ild administer plants, which the sun has
impregnated wi' the spirit of health. But the scenes of
pain, languor, an tmortality, which were perpetually rising
before me, made me often tremble for myself. I saw the
grave open at my feet: I determined, therefore, to contem'plate only the regions beyond it, and to despise every acquisition which I could not keep. I conceived an opinion,
that as there was no merit but in voluntary poverty, and silent meditation, those who desired money were not proper
objects of bounty; and that:'by all who were proper objects
of bounty, money was despised. I, therefore, buried mine
in the earth; and renouncing society, I wandered into a wild
and sequestered part of the country. My dwellirng was a
cave by the side of a hill. I drank the running water from
the spring, and ate* such fruits and herbs as I could finld.
To increase the austerity of my life, I frequently watched

the east, resigning myself to the secret influences of the
Prophet.
" One morning after my nocturnal vigil, just as I per
ceived the horizon glow at the approach of the sun, the
power of sleep became irresistible, and I sunk under it. I
imagined myself still sitting at the entrance of my cell; that
the dawn increased; and that as I looked earnestly for the
first beam of day, a dark spot appeared to intercept it. I
perceived that it was in motion; it increased in size as it
drew near, and at length I discovered it to be an eagle. I
still kept my eye fixed steadfastly upon it, and saw it alight
at a small distance, where I now descried a fox whose two
fore-legs appealeed to be broken.  Before this fox the eagle
laid part of a klld, which she had brought in her talons, and
then disappeared.
" When I awaked, I laid my forehead upon the ground,
and blessed the Prophet for the instruction of the morning. I reviewed my dream, and said thus to myself, Cosrou, thou hast done well to renounce the tumult, the business, and vanities of life: but thou hast as yet only done
it in part; thou art still every day busied in the search of
food; thy mind is not wholly at rest; neither is thy trust
in Providence complete.  What art thou taught by this
vision? If thou hast seen an eagle commissioned by Heaven
to feed a fox that islame, shall not the hand of Heaven also
supply thee with food, when that which prevents thee from
procuring it for thyself, is not necessity, but devotion?
"I was now so confident of a rrculoss, sutpply, that I
neglected to walk out for my repasvhich,-after the first
day, I expected with an impatience   t left me little power
of attending to any other objejt.. This, impatience, however, I labored to suppress, and persisted in my resolution:
but my eyes at length began to fail me, and my knees smote
each other; I threw myself backwvardt and hoped my weakness would soon increase ta insensibility.  But I was suddenly roused by the voice of a    visible being, who pronounced these words:' Cosroi,./:  the angel, who, by the
commalld of the Almighty, have reistered the thoughts of
thy heart, which I am now commissioned to reprove.'While
thou wast attempting to become wise above that which is
revealed, thy folly has perverted the instruction which was
vouchsafed thee. Art thou disabled like the fox? hast thou
not rather the powers of the eagle? Arise, let the eagle bd

79the object of thy emulation. To pain and sickness, be thou
again the messenger of ease and health. Virtue is not rest,
hut action. If thou doest good to man as an evidence of thy
jove to God, thy virtue will be exalted from mortal to divine;
and that happiness which is the pledge of paradise, will be
thy reward upon earth.'
"At these words, I was not less astonished than if a
mountain had been overturned at my feet. I humbled myself in the dust; I returned to the city; I dug up my treasure; I was liberal, yet I became rich. My skill in restoring health to the body, gave me frequent opportu'nit4s of
curing the diseases of the soul. I grew eminent- beyond my
merit; and it was the pleasure of the king that I should
stand before him. Now, therefore, be not offended; 1
boast of no knowledge that I have not received.  As the
sands of the desert drink up the drops of rain, or the dew
of the morning, so do I also, who am but dust, imbibe the
instructions of the Prophet.
"Believe, then, that it is he who tells thee, all knowledge is profane, which terminates in.thyself; and by a
life wasted in speculation, little even of this can be gained. When the gates of paradise are thrown open before
thee, thy mind shall be irradiated in a moment. Here,
thou  canst do little more than  pile error upon' error:
there, thou shalt build truth upon truth.  Wait, therefore,
for the glorious vision; and in the mean-time emulate the
eagle. Much is in thy power; and, therefore, much is expected of thee.  Th   h the Almighty only can give virtue,, yet, as a prince,   u mayest stimulate those to beneficence, who act fpa.n    higher motive than immediate interest: thou canst    roduce the principle, but mayest enforce the practice.    thy virtue be tlhus diffused; and if
thou believest with rerence, thou shalt be accepted above.
Farewell! May the:smile of Him  who resides in the
heaven of heavens be upon thee; and against thy name, in
the volume of His will, may happiness be written!"
The king, whose doubts, like those of Mirza, were now
removed, looked up witta. smile that communicated the joy
of his mind. He dismissed the prince to his government;
and commanded these events to be recorded, to the end
that posterity may know, "that no life is pleasing to God,
but that which is useful to mankind."LESSON XXIX.

Of the big world, to kiss that good man's hand;,
Who, in the blaze of wisd-om and of art,
Preserves a lowly mind; and to his God,
Feeling the sense of his own littleness,
Is as a child in meek simplicity!

Of letters and of tongues? Even as the mists,
Or the gray morn before the rising sun,

And earthly pride is like the passing flower,

LESSON XXXI.
Ode to Sickness.
T he following ode was written by a young lady in the north of Eng.
land, who, for many years, had been oppressed with a hopeless con.
sumption.
NOT to the rosy maid, whom former hours
Beheld me fondly covet, tune I now
The melancholy lyre: no more I seek
Thy aid Hygeia! sought so long in vain;
But'tis to thee, 0 Sickness!'tis to thee
I wake the silent strings; accept the lay.
Thou art no tyrant waving the fierce scourge
O'er unresisting victims-but ia nymph
Of mild though mournful mien, upon whose brow
Patience sits smiling, and whose heavv eye,
Though moist with tears, is always fixed on heaven.
Thou wrapp'st the world in clouds, but thou canst tell
Of worlds where all is sunshine, and, at lengtth,
hv hen through this vale of sorrow thou hast led
Thy patient sufferers, cheering them the while
WVith many a smile of promise, thy pale hand
Unlocks the bowers of everlasting rest;
Where Death's kind angel waits to dry their tears,
And crown them with his amaranthinV flowers.
- Yet have I known thee long, and I have felt
All that thou hast of sorrow-many a tear
Has fallen on my cold cheek, and many a sigh,
Call'd forth by thee, has swelled my aching breast;
Yet still I bless thee, 0 thou chastening power!
For all I bless thee: thou hast taught my soul
To rest upon itself, to look beyond
The narrow bounds of time, and fix its hopes
On the sure basis of eternity.

[Lesson 31Mean-while, even in this transitory scene,
Of what hast thou deprived me? Has thy hand
Closed up the book of knowledge; drawn a veil
O'er the fair face of nature; or destroyed
The tender pleasures of domestic life?Ah, no!'tis thine to call forth in the heart
Each better feeling; thou awaken'st there
That unconfin'd philanthropy which feels
For all the unhappy; that warm sympathy
Which, casting every selfish care aside,
Fillds its own bliss in seeingr others blest;
That melancholy, tender yet sublime,
Vhich, feeling all the nothingness of earth,
Exalts the soul to heaven:--and, more than these,
That pure devotion, which, even in the hour
Of agonizingr pain, can fill the eyes
With tears of ecstasy-such tears, perhaps,
As angels love to shed.These are thy gifts, O Sickness! these to me
Thou hast vouchsaf'd and taught me how to prize.
Shall my soul shrink from aught thou hast ordained?
Shall I e'er envy the luxurious train
Along Tlwhose path Prosperity has strewed
Her gilled toys?  Ah! let thenm still pursue
Those shining trifles; never shall they know
Such pure and holy pleasures as await
The heart refined by sufferings.  Not to them
Does Fancy sing her wild, romantic song;'Tis not for them her gloxving hand undraws
The sacred veil that hides the an,elic world.
They hear not, in the music of the wvind,
Celestial voices, that, in whispers sweet,
Call to the flowers-the voung and bashful flowers!
They see not, at the shadowy hour of eve,
Descending spirits, who, on silver wings,
Glide through the air, and, to their harps divine,
Sing in soft notes the vesper hymn of praise;
Or, pausing for a moment, as they turn
Their radiant eyes on this polluted scene,
Drop on their golden harps a pitying tear.

the book, to pieces that are plain and easy, and reserving, for the latter part
of it, such as will call for a more mature judgment and a more disciplined
taste in reading.
It will be seen, moreover, from the table of contents, that the selecticn contains pieces of every kind, usually found ir worlis of this nature; and that the
book is not without order. so far as order has been dcemed useftll.
Since the days of Addisonl anl Pope, and even of Johnson, time, which
shows the mutability of all human affairs, has wrought a considerable change
in the manners of the English, in the objects of scientific attention, and
in the character of literary labors among them. The styie of their best writers,
both of prose and verse, has undergone a corresponding change. The miseellaneous literature of the present day, however, is probably as well adarted
to the present modes of thinking and acting, and to the present wants of society, as was the literature of the periodical essayists, and their contemporary
poets, to the age of Anne: and, judging on the ground of comparative utility,
we ought, perhaps, in severe justice, to be as reluctant to prefer the poetry, especially, of Gay, and Parnell, and even of Pope, to that of Beattie, and Byron,
and Campbell, as the contemporaries of Milton and Dryden would, and should
have been, to give Drayton and Spenser, and Chaucer the preference in comparison with the lights of their own age. An old coin may be as pure metl,
and intrinsically as valuable, as a new one; and to the curious much more
valuable; but, for the ordinary purposes of life, it is useful no longer than it
is current. So it is with literature-with the golden thoughts that have received the impress of genmus. In the following work, therefobre, I have drawn
liberally, from the literary treasures of our own age, not to the exclusion,
however, of many pieces of old English poetry, especially of several fromn
Shakspeare, which are common stock in works of tbis kind, and over which
time has no power.
I have also laid tinder contribution the literature of our own country, and
this I have done with the view of rendering the book an acceptable offering to
the American people, not so much by appealing to their national pride, as by
making it more worthy of their approbation, on account of its intrinsic
merits. It is not my province to decide upon the value of those pieces which
are drawn from European sources, compared with those, of American origin
in respect to the prorfs they furnish of a cultivated literary taste, of poetical
genius, of a mature and manly eloquence, and of' pure and lofty moral sentiment. On this subject I choose rather to let the world decide for itself; and
that this may be the more easily done, the latter are distinguished from
the former, in the table of contents, by giving in small capitals, the names of
their authors, or of the books from whilcl they were takell. These form nearly one quarter of the volume. It might have deserved, and might meet, a
more flattering reception from the publ[ic, had a still greater proportion of it
consisted of the labors of our own authors. Of these there are two classes,
to whom it may be thought I owe an apology-those with whom I have taken
liberties, and those from whom I have takeii nothing.
In regard to the latter class, it is but justice to them, and to myself, to say
that it has required an effort on my part to resist, rather than to feel and acknowledge, the claims of mainy writers among us, ro a share in the honor of
having their names brought before the eye, and their strains of eloquence or
poetry poured upon the ear, and made familhar to the mind of the rising generatioii. But such authors-among whom are my personal friends, men
whom I love and venerate-will do me the justice to consider, that much that
is excellent in itself is not well adapted to the use of' schools, and that had I
taken all that is good in American literature, or even a tithe from each one of
the authors of the present day who have done honor. to their country, both
at home and abroad, I should have swelled the book to such a size as to effectually exclude it from school-houses; and thus should have defeated, at the
tbreshold, the leading object of the compilation.
To the former class,-tor the liberties which I have taken with what [ now
give forth under their name, in occasiornally substituting one word for at Dther,
1&gt;I breathe one fervent prayer; attend my strain!
If for my faded brow thy hand prepare
Some future wreath, let me the gift resign:
Transfer the rosy garland: let it bloom
Around the temples of that friend beloved,
On whose -maternal bosom, even now,
I lay my aching head! and, as I mlark
The smile that plays upon her speaking face,
Forget that I have ever shed a tear.
LESSON XXXII.
Beply to the Address of a Missionary, at a Council oJ the
Chiefs of " the Six. Nations," in 1805,-by Sagnyn Whathah, alias Red Jacket.-PrILANTHROPIST.
Friend and Brother!
IT was the will of the Great Spirit, that we should meet
together this day. He orders all things; and has, given~
us a fine day for our council.  He has taken his garment
from before the sun, and caused it to shine with brightness
upon us.  Our eyes are opened that we see clearly; our
ears are unstopped, that we have been able to hear distinctly the words you have spoken. For all these favors we
thanki the Great Spirit, and him only.
Brother! Listen to what we sayv. There was a time when
our forefathers owned this great island.  Their seats extended from the rising to the setting sun: the Great Spirit
had lnade it for the use of the indians.  He had created the
blffalo, the deer, and other aninmals for food.  IIe had madcie,
the bear and the beaver; thleir skins served us for clothing.
He had scattered them over the country, and taught us howto take them.  He had caused the earth to produce corn
for bread.  All this he had done for his red children, because he loved them.  If we had disputes about our hunt
irg ground, they were generally settled without the shed
ir,g of much blood.  But an evil day came upon us; your
forefathers crossed the great waters, and landed on this
island: their nunibers were small: they found us friends,.
and not enemies.  They told us they had fled from their
own country, through fear of wicked men, and had come
nere to enjoy their religion.  They asked for a small seat;
we took pity on them, anid granted their request: and they
sat down amongst us. We gave them corn and meat, ani,
[Lesson 3.,in return, they gave us poison.  The white people having
now found our country, tidings were sent back, and more
came amongst us; yet we did not fear them.  We took them
to be friends: they called us brothers; we believed thlem,
and gave them a larger seat. At lerngth their number so
increased, that they wanted more land: they wanted our
country.  Our eyes were opened, and we became uneasy.
Wars took place; Indians were hired to fight against Indians;  and many of our people were destroyed.  They also
distriblted liquor amongst us, which has slain thousands.
Brother!  Once our seats were large, and yours were
small. You have now become a great people, and we have
scarcely a place left to spread our blankets.  You have got
our country, but, not satisfied, you want to force your religion upon us.
Brother! Continue to listen. You say you are sent to
instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his
mind, and that if we do not take hold of the religion which
you teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. How do we
know this to be true? We understand that your religion is
written in a book. If it was intended for us as well as you,
why has not the Great Spirit given it to u$; and not only to
us, but why did he not give to our forefathers the knowledge of that book, with the means of rightly understanding
it?.We onlly know what you tell us about it, and having
been so often deceived by the white people, how shall we
believe what they say?
Brotlzer!  You say there is but one way to worship and
serve the Great Spirit. If there is but one religion, why do
you white people differ so much about it?   Why not all
agree, as you can all read the book?
Brother!  We do not understand these things: we are.
told that your religion was given to your forefathers, and
has been handed down from father to son. W\e also have
a religion which was given to our forefathers, and has
been handed down to us: it teaches us to be thani,ful for all
favors received, to love each other, and to be united: twe never
quarrel about religion.
Brother!  The G-reat Spirit made us all; but he has
made a great difference between his white and his red children:-he has given us different complexions and different customs. To you he has given the arts; to these he
has not opened our eyes.  Since he has made so great a
difference between us in other things, why may he not have
Lesson 32.1
87given us a different religion? The Great Spirit does right:
he knows what is best for his children.
Brother! We do not want to destroy your religion, or to
take it from you. We only want to enjoy our own.
Brother!  We are told that you have been preaching  to
the white people in this place. These people are our neighbors. We will wait a little, and see w-hat effect your
preaching has had upon them. If we find it makes them
honest, and less disposed to cheat Indians, we will then consider again of what you have said.
Brother! You have now heard our answer, and this is all
we have to say at present. As we are about to part, we will
come and take you by the hand: and we hope the Great
Spirit will protect you on your journey, and return you safe
to your friends.
LESSON  XXXIII.
Dialogue between Mercury, an English duellist, and a Nortk
American Savage.--DIALOGUEs OF THE DEAD.
Duellist.
MERCURY, Charon's boat is on the other side of the water; allow me, before it returns, to have some conversation with the North -.c.... -;Sc r you brsugtr
hither at the same time that you conducted me to the shades.
I never saw one of that species before, and am curious to
know what the animal is. He looks very grim.-Pray, Sir.
what is your name? I understand you speak English.
Savage. Yes, I learned it in my childhood, having been
bred up for some years in the town of New York: but before I was a man, I returned to my countrymen, the valiant
Mohawks, and having been cheated by one of yours in the
sale of some rum, I wished never to have any thing to do
with them  afterwards. Yet, with the rest of my tribe, 1
took up the hatchet for them  in the war against France.
and was killed while I was upon a scalping party. But 1
died very well satisfied; for my friends were victorious, alnd
before I was shot I had scalped seven men and five women
and children. In a former war I had done still greater
exploits. My name is the Bloody Bear: it was given me to
denote my fierceness and valor.
Duellist. Bloody Bear, I respect you, and am much your
[Lesson 33.hurble servant. My name is Tom  Pushwell, very well
known at Arthur's. I am a gentleman by birth, and by profession a gamester, and a man of honor. I have killed
men in fair fighting, in honorable single combat, but I do
not understand cutting the throats of women and children.
Savage. Sir, that's our way of making war. Every nation has its own customs. But, by the grimness in your countenance, and that hole in your breast, I presume you were
killed, as I was myself, in some scalping party. How happened it that your enemy did not take off your scalp  
Duellist. Sir, I was killed in a duel. A friend of mine
had lent me some money; after two or three years, being
himself in great want, he asked me to pay him; I thought
his demand an affront to my honor, and sent him a challenge. We met in Hyde Park; the fellow could not fence'
I was the most adroit swordsman in England. I gave him
three or four wounds; but at last he ran upon me with such
impetuosity that he put me out of my play, and I could not
prevent him  from whipping me through the lungs. I died
the next day, as a man of honor should, without any snivelling signs of repentance; and he will follow me soon, for
his surgeon has declared his wounds to be mortal. It is said
that his wife is dead of her fright, and that his family ofr
seven children will be undone by his death. So I am well
revenged; and that is a comfort. For my part I had no
wife. I always hated marriage.
Savage. Mercury, I won't go in a boat with that fellow.
He has murdered his countryman; he has murdered his
friend. I say I won't go in a boat with that fellow, I will
swim over the river; I can swim like a duck.
Mercury. Swim over the Styx! it must not be done: it is
against the laws of Pluto's empire. You must go in the
boat, so be quiet.
Savage. Do not tell me of laws; I am a savage! I value
no laws. Talk of laws to the Englishman; there are laws
in his country, and yet you see he did not regard them, for
they could never allow him to kill his fellow-subject in time
of peace, because he asked him to pay a debt. The English cannot be so brutal as to make such things lawful.
Mercury. You reason well against him. But how comes
it that you are so offended with murder; you who have massacred women in their sleep, and children in their cradles?
Satvage. I killed none but my enemies; I never killed my
8*k;esson  33.]
E39own countryman; I never killed my friend.  Here, take
my blanket and let it come over in the boat, but see that
the murderer does not sit upon it or touch it; if he does I
will burn it in the fire I see yonder. Farewell. I am resolved to swim over the water.
Mercury. By this touch of my wand I take all thy strength
from thee. Swim now if thou canst.
Savage. This is a very potent enchanter. Restore me
my strength, and I will obey thee.
Mercury. I restore it; but be orderly and do as I bid
you, otherwise worse will befall you.
Duellist. Mercury, leave him to me, I will tutor him for
you. Sirrah, Savage, dost thou pretend to be ashamed of
my company? Dost thou know that I have kept the best
company in England?
Savage. I know  thou art a scoundrel!  Not pay thy
debts! kill thy friend who lent thee money, for asking thee
for it! Get out of my sight, or I will drive thee into the
-Styx.
Mercutry. Stop, I command thee. No violence. Talk to
him calmly.
Savage. I must obey thee.--Well, Sir, let me know what
merit you had to introduce you into good company. What
could you do?  
Duellist. Sir, I gamed as I told you.-Besides that, I kept
a good table.-I ate as well as any man in England or
France.
Savage. Eat! Did you ever eat the chine of a Frenchman, or his leg, or his shoulder?  There is fine eating!  I
have eaten twenty.--My table was always well served. My
wife was the best cook for dressing man's flesh in all North
America. You will not pretend to compare your eating
with mine.
Duellist. I danced very finely.
Savage. I will dance with thee for thy ears.-I can dance
all day long. I can dance the war dance with more spirit
and vigor than any man of my nation; let us see thee begin it. How  thou standest like a post! Has Mercury
struck thee with his enfeebling rod; or art thou ashamed to
betray thy awkwardness?  If he would permit me, I would
teach thee to dance in a way that thou hast not yet seen.
I would make thee caper and leap like a buck. But what
else canst thou do, thou bragging rascal?
Duellist. Oh, heavens! must I bear this? What can

his shade seems to be twice as strong as mine.
Mlercury. You must answer his questions. It was your
own desire to have a conversation with him. He is not
well-bred, but he will tell you some truths which you must
hear in this place. It would have been well for you if you
had heard them above. He asked of you what you could
do besides eating and dancing?
Duellist. I sang very agreeably.
Savage. Let me hear you sing your death-song, or the
war-whoop. I challenge you to sing;-the fellow is mute.
--lercury, this is a liar.-He tells us nothing but lies.' Let
me pull out his tongue.
Duellist. The lie given me!-and, alas! I dare not resent
it. Oh, what a disgrace to the family of the Pushwells!
Mercury. Here Charon, take these two savaoges to your
care. How far the barbarism of the Mohawk will excuse
his horrid acts, I leave Minos to judge; but what excuse
can the Englishman plead? The custom of duelling? An
excuse this, that in these regions cannot avail. The spirit
that made him draw his sword in the combat against his
friend, is not the spirit of honor; it is the spirit of the furies, of Alecto herself. To her he must go, for she has long
dwelt in his merciless bosom.
Savage. If he is to be punished, turn him over to me. I
understand the art of tormenting. Sirrah,* I begin with
this kick, as a tribute to your boasted honor. Get you into
the boat, or I will give you another. I am impatient to have
you condemned.
Duellist. Oh my honor, my honor, to what infamy art
thou fallen

The Mice.-FENELON.

on the carnage committed among her nation by Mitis and

tear her own.
"An excellent thought has just come into my head:--I

FnLq-T CLASS BDQ)hC..read in some book which I gnawed a few days ago, that
there is a fine country, called the Indies, in which mice are
in much greater security than here. In that region, the
sages believe that the soul of a mouse has- been that of a
king, a great captain, or some wonderful saint, and that after
death it will probably enter the body of a beautiful wo-man
or mighty potentate.  If I recollect rightly, this is called
metempsychosis.  Under this idea, they treat all animals
with paternal charity, and build and endow hospitals for
mice, where they are fed like people of consequence.  Come
then, my good sister, let us hasten to a country, the customs
of which are so excellent, and where justice is done to our
merits."  Her neighbor replied, "But, sister, do not cats
enter these hospitals? if they do, metempsychosis must take
place very soon, and in great numbers; and a talon or a
tooth might make a fakir, or a king; a miracle we can very
well do without."  "Do not fear," said the first mouse, "in
these countries order is completely established; the cats
have their houses aswell as we ours, and they have their
hospitals for the sick separate from ours." After this conversation, our- two mice set out together, contriving the evening before she set sail, to creep along the cordage of a vessel
that was to make a long voyage.
They got under weigh, and were enraptured withn the
sight of the sea, which took them from the abominable shores
on which cats exercise their tyranny.  The sail wTas pleasant, and they reached Surat, not like merchants, to acquire
riches, but to receive good treatment from the Hindoos.
They had scarcely'entered one of the houses fitted up for
mice, when they aspired to the best accommodation. One
of them pretended to recollect having formerly been a Bramin on the coast of Malabar, and the other protested that
she had been a fine lady of the same country, with long
ears; but they displayed so much impertinence, that the
-Indian mice lost all patience.  A civil war commenced, and
no quarter was given to the two Franks who pretended to
impose laws on the others; when, instead of being eaten by
cats, they were strangled by their own brethren.  From this
it is evident, that it is useless to go far in search of safety;
as, if we are not modest and wise, we only go into danger'
and if we are so, we may be secure at home.LESSON XXXV.
