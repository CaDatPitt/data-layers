ADJECTIVE.
An Aldective is a word added to a
noun to denote its quality, form or
manner; as, good, great, handsome.
Adjectives are not varied  by
number,* case, or gender, hlaving
nrlone.of their own; but for these,
they are dependent on the noutns
with which they are joined.
They are capable of being in
three states. The first is theirpositive or natural state; the o:h ther two
may be called comparaive states; or
more properly, degrees of eompari.

parison are formed by addinig r or
er, st or est to the positive state; as
Pos.       Corn.       Super.
White,     whiter,     whitest,
Great,     greater,    greatest;
or by the adverbs more,and most,
less and least, placed before the
positive state; thus,
Pos.       Comrn       Super.
WVhite, morQ white, most white, &amp;c.'I'here are a few adjectives compared in a very different manner,
and called irregular; as,
Good,             better, best.
Bad,              worse,  worst.
Mmia,y, or much, more,    most.
Little,           less,   least.
VERB.
A Verb is a. part of speech which
signifies doing, or being; without
which  there can be no     perfect
sentence.
V.rbs may properly be divided
i;nI two kind:s, transitive and intransitw,e.             A transiThe Young Lady's Accidence. 13
A transitive verb is known by
admitting an obljective word after
it; as, I write a letter.
An intransitive verb is known by
not admitting an objective word
after it; as I run, he sleeps, we
stand.
N. B.  Some intransitive verbs
will admit objective words after
thlem, of the same nature or signification; as, to run a race, to dream a
dream, &amp;'c.
There are four things belongitng
to verbs, viz. number, person, mode,
and tense.
The numbers are two, the same
as in nouns.
There are three persons; or
rathler verbs have reference to three
persons in both numbers; which
are, 1, thou, he, she, or it, in the
singular; we, ye, or you, and they,
in the plural.
The modes are five, the infinitive,

the indicative, the imperative, the
potential, and subjunct:ve.
The infinitive mode represents
an action or being indefinitely,
hanving ne'ithecr nlumber, nor person.
nior nlominiative word; as, -to read,
to live; anld is commonily known by
the sign to before it.
The indicative declares an actioni in an absolute manner, with.,
outk any doubt or hesitation; as, I
w'rite, he learns, they did, read; or
else asks a quiestion; as, do I write.?
does he learnt?
The'imperative commiands one
t.o do any thing; as,'write, write yotu.
Th-e potential declares the pav.
er, liberty, inclination, and, olia--

conjunction; as, if, though, whether, unless, &amp;c. as, if he read, though
I write.
Thlere are five tenses, or times, viz.
the present tense, the imperJect, the
pertfct, theplitperfect, and thefuture.
The present tense represents an
action to be now doing; as, I read,
or, I am reading.
The imperfect tense commonly
denotes an action to lave been
done, while something else was doing; as, I read, while you played, or,
Iwas retding, while you wereplaying.
The periect tense represents an
action completed in past time; and
is known by the sign have; as, I
have read, or, I have been reading.
The pluperfect represents an action as past, prior to some othler
action; and is known by the sign
had; as, I had read when le told me
of it, or, I. ad been readi'zg, &amp;c.
Tfhe  future tense denotes the
time to come; and is known by the
signs16 The Yotmng Lady's.ccidencc.
signs shall or will; as, I shall reacd, hfe
zvill read, or, I shall be readi,ng, &amp;c.
In the formnation of the several
modes and tenses, the English make
use of a numnber of small words
called auxiliaries or /helping verbs,
wvhich are, do, be, have, shall, may,
can, must, would, could, should, and
their inflections.
N. B. Do, be, and have, are, likewise, frequently used as principal
verbs; as, I do my duty, I have a
book, &amp;c.
The following is an example of the
variations of a regular verl) througl
the several modes and tenses.
INFINITIVE MODE.

the first person, promises or threatens; but in the second and third,

CON NJUA C TION,
Conjunctions are a part of speech
which joins words and sentences
together.  They are of two kinds,
copulative, and disjunctive.  The
copulative conjuctioln joins both
words and sentences together, and
continues the sense; as, you and I
will read, and he shall read with us.
The"disjunctive joins sentences, but
expresses oppoqsition in: the sen se;
as, you and  read; but he plays.
~l'he conjunctions are, and, also,
as,* either, both, but, if, lest, or
nor, neither, that, because, yet, unless, except, w htther, althouigh,
sitme, though, nevertheless, not
withstanding.

nominative toa verb; as, to see is
pleasant;40 The Young Lady's iccidence.
pleasant; to do justice and to love
mercy is the duty of man.
Note. Wheni the infinitive mode

signifying tile same thing, are said
to be in apposition, and are put in
thile same case; as, George the King.

D2                 RULE42 The Young Lady's.4ccidence.
RULE XV.

RULE XVI.
Conjunctions couple like cases,
and like modes and tenses; as, 1
and he; she reads and writes well.

S lUt,0. \vh n:y a 0 rti)  I j o:i -n d,
and there is no word to0goern  it;
as,
* A noun is frequently mistalen for this participle: as, in rta tACCVsao himI, &amp;c. W!heu.

native  case, and, sometimes, the
objective;-as, 0 thou!: alas me!
N. D. rTi le nominative case to a
verb, the noun to an adjective, and
the antecedent to a relative, may
be found by asking the question
who -or -w/at; as, =the boys, who
play, will be punished.  Who will
be punished?  the answer is, the
boys; whichll is the nominative.

PUNCTU.4TION.
Punctuaztion; is the art of placing
the several rests or pauses, which
are used in writing.
This is better learned by prac.

precise  rules; indee, there  are
none; for almost- every author, in
some measure, follows his own taste
in this respect. A hint or two upon
the subject must therefore, sufice
The pauses are;four, viz  the
comma, semicolon, coon and period.
Tl'he period bI)eing the longest,
measures a complete sentence, in
which all the others ar- conitainied;
