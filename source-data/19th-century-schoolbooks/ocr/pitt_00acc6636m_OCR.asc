William and Mary, the outcome of the original '

idea, did not receive its charter until 1693. The
Puritans of Massachusetts were more fortunate and
more prudent than the Cavaliers of Virginia, for
they suffered no loss by any extensive massacre,
and they depended upon themselves instead of
looking for help from England, where, indeed, they
had few friends. Their “school or college” at
Newtown (Cambridge) was begun ' in 1636 with
only four hundred pounds in money, but two years
later it received a sum amounting, it is supposed,
to seven or eight hundred pounds, together with
a respectable library, by the will of John Harvard,

‘the young Charlestown minister whose name Har-

vard University now bears. From that time its
income was small but sure, and its existence during
the latter part of the seventeenth centurydid much
to give Massachusetts the literary start which the

‘ greater wealth and the imported instructors of the

Virginia institution could not offset. In both colo-
nies, however, schools, and their inevitable result,
book-making, appeared with creditable promptness;
and those colonists who ﬁrst taught or wrote have
their posthumous reward in the most vigorous olf-
shoot that the literature of any nation has ever
been able to put forth. American literature has a
right to a share in the heritage of the countrymen
of Czedmon and Chaucer and Shakespeare; but
its enforced independence and its familiarity with

J. G. Holland was a sensible and plain—spoken pop-
ular essayist, and wrote some fair novels of Ameri-

As a poet he has been equally popular, though with
less deserts. Henry T. Tuckerman, in numerous
books and a host of essays, did good service to
native literature and art.

CHAPTER IV.
AFTER 1861.

I. LITERATURE OF THE CIVIL WAR.—It is still
convenient to follow the division of time by wars,
omitting that with Mexico, which formed no break
in current history. As in the Revolution and the
war of 1812, very little that was notable was added
to theliterature of the country by the civil war
of 1861. Most of the poets wrote one or two
stirring pieces, and many new writers came into

notice by the publication of meritorious occasional

verse. But as a rule the creative powers of our
best authors seemed somewhat benumbed, though,
strangely enough, books and readers greatly mul-
tiplied between 1861 and 1864, partly in conse-
quence of the largely increased circulation of the
periodical press. Immediately on the close of the
struggle, and even during its progress, many popu-
lar histories were hurried upon the market, but of
course the events described were yet too fresh in
mind to permit impartiality on either side. A vast
Reéelliorz Record’, edited by Frank Moore, has pre«
served plenty of material for the future writer.
This useful work is arranged under three divisions;
a diary of events, a reissue of leading documents

of importance, and a liberal selection from popular
poetry and newspaper incidents on both sides. Of
the histories that have thus far appeared, those by
Horace Greeley and ‘Alexander H. Stephens are
fullest in their accounts of the antislavery contest
which preceded and attended the war; while that
by Dr. John W. Draper, a student of politics and
science, is the nearest approach yet made to an
unpartisan record. The ﬁrst volume of Mr. Gree-
ley’s history (which is comprised in two) is more
valuable than the second, for in it a life-long spec-
tator and combatant in the antislavery struggle
records the events with which he was so closely
connected. Mr. Stephens’s work lays great stress
upon the rise and development of the doctrine of
state rights, of which the author was a1 able
defender. Elaborate as is Mr. Greeley’s story of
the slavery agitation, a still larger and more valu-

able history thereof is contained in Vice-President

Wilson’s Rise and Fall of #26 Slave Power 2'72 Amer-
ica, comprised in three volumes. Mr. Wilson’s
knowledge of political history was as extensive asl
Mr. Greeley’s, and the judicial quality of his mind
somewhat more marked. He had the advantage,
furthermore, of writing long after the close of the
war, instead of in its midst. This history was the
closing, and in some sense the most valuable, work
of his life. Many of the generals engaged on either
side have published their reminiscences of cam-

paigns, at greater or less length. Of these, General
Sherman’s were at once the most important and
outspoken, and called out many replies from injured
oﬂicers. Lieutenant-General Scott published in
1864 two volumes of autobiography, having a some»
what modest literary and historical value.

2. POETS.-— Of recent years American poetry has
been somewhat inﬂuenced by the English pre-
Raphaelites, whose methods and tastes , Poe, to a
certain extent, had foreshadowed twenty years
before. A renewed interest in purely national or
local subjects, in this country, accompanied, rather
than was caused by, the new-romanticism of the

V English writers of the Swinburne school, who have

found in our Whitman and Miller greater merits to
admire than in the more conventional writers whom
the majority of readers are accustomed to revere.
Their celebration of the wilder elements in our life,
and their freedom from restraint, have seemed ad-
mirable to London-bred critics; and their English
friends have doubtless taken pleasure in singling
out for special praise writers whose clientage was
not so numerous in this country, and whose subjects
would seem stranger in London thanin New York.
The old inattention to our literature, on the part of
Englishmen, has given place to a somewhat inju-
dicious and undiscriminating praise. But, fostered
by home development and foreign admiration, an
original and excellent element in American liter

BA YARD TA YLOR. 89

ature has rapidly grown within the past twenty
years. The great majority of our writers, however,
have been content to work faithfully in the old
paths, and many living authors, popularly assigned
to the second rank, may fairly be called the peers
of some of their predecessors of higher reputation.

3. BAYARD TAYLOR had acquired a substantial
literary reputation before the date at which this
chapter begins; but since his future renown will
chieﬂy rest, doubtless, upon his volumes of poems
published since 1862, it is well to enter his name
in this place. He was born at Kennett Square, a

‘Pennsylvania country town, in 182 5, and while a

very young man became famous for a vivacious
account of a pedestrian tour in Europe. California,
Egypt, Asia Minor, India, Japan, and other coun-
tries were afterwards visited by the indefatigable
tourist, whose numerous books of travel proved to
have great popular interest, and permanent value
for reference. In 1863 Mr. Taylor published his
ﬁrst novel, fiamza/z T/zzzrsiozz, which was followed
within the next seven years by fa/272 Godfrey’: Fora‘-
zmes, T/ze Sfory of K6/zizefl, and fosep/z mm’ /22":
Fﬂma’. These four novels, besides ingeniousness
of plot and cleverness of situation, are noted for
their accurate pictures of American life, especially
in the Quaker region of Pennsylvania, which the
author knew thoroughly. Between 1844 and 1855,
Mr. Taylor put forth seven volumes of poetry,

chieﬂy noteworthy for lyrical excellence. Tﬁe Poet’:
fourrzal (I862), T/ze Picture of S2‘. _/M72 (1866), 2726
Masque of #26 Goa’: (1872), Lars (1873), and T/ze
Pro]?/zez‘(1:874), a Mormon drama, are more elab-
orate works. Priizce Deuéalzbn, an allegorical
drama of social progress—-ambitious but not suc-
cessful—appeared in 1878. Some of his longer
poems have been produced with a rapidity recalling
the Italian z'mpr072z'sa2‘0rz'.. Tﬁe Ea/10 Clué (published
in 1876, though written in 1872) is a series of clever
imitations of the leading poets of the century. A
translation of both parts of Faust appeared in 1870
and 1871, in which the original metres were repro-

I duced with surprising faithfulness.

4. RICHARD HENRY STODDARD, a native of Hing-
ham, Massachusetts, is the author of nine volumes
of short poems, showing poetic spirit and a graceful

, touch, on many themes of nature and life. He has

been an editor of many collections of verse, and of
several volumes of literary reminiscence.

5.» JOHN GODFREY SAxE,born in Vermont in 1816,
has been more successful than any other American
poet in classical travesties and in witty turns of
language. His collected poems do not ﬁll a large
volume, but are full of rollicking humor. As a son-
neteer Mr. Saxe has won a good place. His humor~
ous poems with a moral are neatly pointed, and his

fables and legends are often happy, whether their

subjects are old or new.

W/IL T WHITMAN. 91

6. ]oH1-'. TOWNSEND TROWBRIDGE, born in 1827,
first became known as a writer of excellent juvenile
stories signed by Paul Creyton. Fat/zer Brégr/zt/zopes
and Tﬁe Ola’ Baffle-Grozmd are the best of them.
[\/Ezgg/zéorfaréwood (1857) has hardly been surpassed
as a picture of American home life in the country.
Mr. Trowbridge’s other novels are Czmjolv Cave,
T/ze Tﬂree Scouls, Lucy Arlyn, and ./V£:>z;g/zbors’ I/Vz'7/es.
The two first dealt with the civil war, during which
they were very popular. Upon his poems, though
few in number, Mr. Trowbridge has expended his
greatest care. T/ze Vagaéomis (1864) is an excellent
union of pathos and humor; in his lesser lyrics and

in the ﬁve poems grouped under the title of T/ze

Book of Gala’ (1877) subjects of love, or life, or
humor, are handled in pleasing fashion.

7. WALT WHITMAN was born at West Hills, Long
Island, in 1819, and began life as a school-teacher

M and literary man, writing rather feeble stories and

indifferent poems for the magazines, in the ordinary
style, under the name of Walter Whitman. In
185 5, reducing Walter to Walt, he printed in Brook-
lyn a peculiar volume called Leaves of Grass,-=
rhapsody rather than poetry, being neither rhymed
nor versiﬁed. This work, which has several times
been enlarged, is devoted to a large variety of sub-
jects, many of the poems being personal, while all
are pervaded with a love of liberty in conscience
and politics. The catalogue style is a prevailing

92 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

blemish, and Whitman’s overruling desire to be nat-
ural makes him fall into real affectations; but there
are some strong and ﬁne lines in the poems. 0
C'ezp2‘ezz'7z, my Cezpz‘ezz'7z, shows that he is not fettered
by rhyme. W/zen L2’/ezes Zezsz‘ 27¢ 2‘/ze Deoryard
bloomed is the best poem evoked by the assassina-
tion of President Lincoln. Many of the poems
in Leaves of Gmss are grossly indecent, and the
“ upward look” is conspicuously absent from Whit-

man’s verse. The world’s great poets have been A

morally in advance of their times; Whitman lags
behind the average sentiment of his day and

country.

8. JOAQUIN MILLER, whose real name is Cincin~
natus Heine Miller, has been miner, Nicaraguan,
Indian resident, and county judge. Songs of Me
Sierras, wild /poems of the West, somewhat polished
in versiﬁcation by a careful study and thorough

  admiration of Byron and Swinburne, appeared in

London in 1870. Songs zy’ Me Szmlemds, and 7/»
S/zip’ in I/ze Desert are later poems, and the author
has written an Italian novel, an account of life
among the Indians, a collection of graphic prose
sketches of life in the far West, called I/ze Ez'rst
.Fczm’Zz'es of 2‘/ze Szerrezs, a society story in verse, Tﬂe
Baroness of A/Yew York, etc. Miller is a sort of
Oregon Byron in his freedom of spirit and his love
of rhythmical luxuriance, and he has cultivated with
zeal the far Western ﬁeld in literature. Old-World

subjects, however, are not unknown to his hands.
Whitman and Miller are the chief American kindred
of the English pre-Raphaelites.

9. FRANCIS BRET HARTE, a native of Albany, has
written short stories and sketches of California life,
having wonderful wit and pathos, of which T /ze Luck
of [€oorz'7ég Camp and Tile Ozeleezsls of Poker Flal are
the best. Of his poems some are in dialect, The
Ifeal/zen C/zlnee having had the widest circulation of
any recent poem.‘ The author has written a long
novel, Goorzel Conroy; and T ﬁankful Blossom, a
novelette of Revolutionary times in New Jersey.

4Two Men of Sandy Bar, a drama, is a stage pres-

entation of some of the characters of the mining
region, including a curious export to California,
Colonel Culpepper Starbottle.  Harte’s Eastern
sketches—notably that of T /ze Dz'sa;§poz'm‘ed 0ﬁee-

  seeker at I/Vaskzozgloiz —— are only less good than those

of the West. His Condensed Novels, prose bur-
lesques several times revised, are clever.

rod. JOHN HAv.—The popular dialect poetry of
the time ﬁnds its best illustration in the  Bludso
of John Hay, a native of Indiana, who was Pres-
ident Lincoln’s secretary during the war. A Volume
called Pike Cozmly Ballads includes this poem and
others as good. Mr. Hay was the originator of a
fashion in which he found a troop of imitators but
no equals, owing to his slow method-of composition
and his faithful literary artisanship. The same

new surroundings have given it character and
deserts of its own.

2. THE THEoLoG1cAL ERA.-— At the outset Amer-
ican literature was imitative; the ﬁrst writers were
of English birth and education, and the early col-
leges were closely fashioned after the Oxford and
Cambridge pattern, in which divinity and the “hu-
manities” held the ﬁrst place. The settlers of
Massachusetts were men who had fought and suf-
fered for their religious opinions, and they naturally
held them with considerable ﬁrmness, as opposed to
the Church of England on the one hand, and the
Baptists and Quakers on the other. So long as the

inﬂuence of the Puritans and their descendants was

predominant, it was natural that the affairs of the
soul should be uppermost; and not until politics
began to interest the colonists in a vital manner did
religious books and tracts cease to form the bulk of

the issues of the press. Novels and plays were

unknown; poetry was didactic, devotional, or satiri-
ca1;'histories were prejudiced by the theological

‘opinions of their writers; and philosophy became

an important study only as a means of religious
defence. One of the very ﬁrst issues, of the print-
ing-press set up at Cambridge in 1639 was the Bay
Psalm Book, a metrical version mainly written by
New England divines. This was the ﬁrst book
written and printed at home, for though George
Sandys, an English gentleman connected with the

honesty appears in a very different form in Ccm‘z'/my
Days, a prose volume of ﬁnished Spanish sketches.
Other original writers of dialect verse have been
Charles Godfrey Leland, who in various H0725 Brez'2‘«
mczmz Volumes put the semi-Americanized German
into amusing verse; Charles G. Halpine, whose
Miles O’Reilly was a favorite Hibernian ﬁgure
during the war; and W. M. Carleton, who, without
the aid of misspelling, has celebrated the average
Western farmer and his wife.

11. THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH is one of the many
natives of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, who have
won success in literature. His boyhood was passed
in that ancient seaport town, in New Orleans, and
in New York. Before he was twenty he became
an industrious worker on the New York press, and
his ﬁrst book was published when he was but nine’
teen. Ike Ballad of Baéie Be/Z (afterwards enti~
tled Baéy Bell), a faultless poem of child-death, has
had for many years a permanent place in popular
favor.’ Between 1855 and 1862 Mr. Aldrich pub-
lished several small volumes of poems, a pretty
little juvenile story in prose, and 0m‘ of My I2’mzi,
a curious romance never reissued by the author.
In 1865 Mr. Aldrich collected his complete poet’
ical works in a single volume.‘ He has always
been his own severest critic, and has sternly re«
jected poems the public would prefer to keep, be-
sides revising others which seemed excellent a:

first. This collected edition Was again carefully
revised ten years later, and put forth under the title
of Clam of Gold’. Flower and Thorn (1876) com-
prises all the additional poems which the author
cares to preserve. Mr. Aldrich’s genius is of a rare
and delicate quality; his numerous lyrics are full of
melody, and his few’ sonnets are among the best
written by American poets. Friar }’erome’s Beauz‘z°—
ful Book and Gczrizczuz‘ Ha/Z, longer pieces in blank
verse, are in a narrative style which the author has
seldom cultivated. After a considerable pause, Mr.
Aldrich began to write prose once more, in the form
of short stories and sketches, having an exquisite
humor, and chieﬂy notable for surprising cleverness
of situation. Tﬁe Siory of a Baa’ Boy (1869), his

i second juvenile, reproduced in its Tom Bailey the

author’s youthful experiences in Portsmouth, which,
as “Rivermouth,” appears in nearly all his stories.
Pruziwzce Palfrey (I874), T/ze Qzzém of S/zeécz (1877),
and 2726 S!z'ZZze/afar Tragedy (1880) are novels of
moderate length, having, in substance, the ﬁnish
and quiet humor of the shorter stories.

12. EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN is likewise emi-
nent as a lyrist. A member of the Yale class of
18 5 3, he has for the most of his life been a banker,
though writing constantly for the press. Tﬂe Dia-
mmz/Z lVea’a’z'7zg (I859) ﬁrst attracted general atten-

tion as a brilliant social satire, though the author‘

was already doing better work in shorter poems.

96 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

A/zkeof Il[07Z77ZOZll%, a war story in verse, succeeded
Poems, Lyric aim’ Idyllzk. T/ze Blczmaless Priizce was
Mr. Stedman’s third volume. These three books,
though each beginning with a long poem, were
chieﬂy excellent for purely lyrical beauty. In 1873
a collected edition appeared. Of its contents the
poems called T/ze Doorslep, Tozzjozzrs Amour, and
Zazzra, my Darlmg (to his wife) have been most
liked, and have found a permanent place in the
anthologies. Ifazm‘/zomze, mm’ Oz‘/zer Poems (1877),
a thin volume, includes the later pieces, the ﬁrst
being the ﬁnest tribute yet paid to the memory of
the romancer. In his Vz'cz‘om'am Poets (1876) is pre-

sented an elaborate review of the entire body of

contemporary English verse. It is one of the most
judicial of American books of criticism, and is
especially just toward the new romantic school, with
the works of the humblest members of which Mr.
Stedman is intimately acquainted. It is written in
a somewhat artiﬁcial style.

13. THE PIATTS, John James and his wife Sallie
M. Bryan, have written no long pieces, but have
been, in a sense true of very few other American
authors, “poets’ poets.” Mrs. Piatt’s» conceits and
moods are more marked than those of her husband,
but in her poems pathos and sentiment are real.
Her subjects are novel and their elaboration deli-
cate. Mr. Piatt’s condensation of style never be-
comes obscure, and he is. happy in his descriptions
If natural scenery.

OTHER POE TS. 97

14. OTHER PoETs.— In the Southern newspapers,
during the civil war, there was a considerable amount
of war poetry, the best of which was written by
Henry Timrod, whose Spriizg is his ﬁnest poem.
Paul H. Hayne, of Georgia, is one of our best
sonneteers, and his poetry catches the spirit of
Southern scenery. He is less successful in depict~
ing the scenes and portraying the character of medi-
eevalism. Of northern poets made famous by their
war poems, the chief not hitherto mentioned are
Henry Howard Brownell, who wrote spirited naval
pieces; Forceythe Willson,—the author of 2715 0/12’
Sergeant‘ and of non-martial poems of still greater
excellence; Elbridge J. Cutler, a Harvard professor,
whose ringing and ﬁnished War Ziyrics, though
admirable, he modestly printed in the smallest of
editions; and Thomas Buchanan Read, who found
in his S/zerz'a’cm’s R2216 a popularity never won by his
previous poems. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe’s Batile
H)/M72 of 1/26 lﬁepuélic was more famous during the
struggle than any other single lyric. George P.
Lathrop’s [Bose aim’ Roof-Tree includes pieces.which,
while thoroughly original, are half Tennysonian in
their treatment of landscape. Sidney Lanier wrote
in 1876 a curious Ceizteizizzkzl Ode to Calzmzlzicz, which
aims to be in poetry some such thing as Wagner’s
music is in orchestration. Of recent female poets
of high rank the number is surprisingly large, and
half the poems in current periodicals are by women.

98 A PRIME]? 01? AMERICAN ZLITERA TURE.

As a rule they write short poems of mood or
description rather than of creation or narration.
Margaret J. Preston, Elizabeth Akers Allen, Rose
Terry Cooke, Nora Perry, Lucy Larcom, Celia
Thaxter, and Helen Fiske Jackson (“H. H.”) are
the most eminent. Mrs. Thaxter’s poems of the
sea are the fruit of long acquaintance with the
barren Isles of Shoals in New Hampshire. To
Mrs. Jackson belongs the ﬁrst place among the
writers whom we have named. Soon after the
appearance of her ﬁrst volume of verse, in 1874,
Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: “The poems of a

lady who contents herself with the initials H. H.

have rare merit of thought and expression, and will
reward the reader for the careful attention which
they require.” There is somewhat of the Emer-
sonian mood and method in Mrs. ]ackson’s poetry,
which is the modern successor of 7716 Dial verse of
I840. Mrs. Jackson’s prose sketches in B273 0/
Travel and B2)‘: of Talk excel in minute description.

15. WILLIAM DEAN HowELLs, one of the ﬁrst of
recent writers, was born at Martinsville, Ohio, in
1837. He was a country editor until 1860, when he
wrote a campaign life of Abraham Lincoln, which
had a great circulation during that year. It was
never acknowledged by the author, though as liter-
ature it was nearly as good as Hawthorne’s life of
Pierce. In 1861 Mr. Howells was given the polit-
ically unimportant consulate at Venice. Never did

an author make better literary use of his position,
at the same time performing its oﬂicial duties faith-
fully. Not until his return, in 1865, did he begin to
publish the fruits of his Italian sight-seeings. Vene-
tzkm Lg’/’e appeared in 1866, and ]2‘aZz'cm]ozzmeys the
next year. Their descriptionsgwere faithful, and
their literary style of surprising excellence. After 2
brief ‘period of editorship in New York, Mr. How-
ells went to Boston as assistant editor of T/ze AZ/cm
2‘z'c ./110722‘/zly, the controlling editorship of which he
assumed on the retirement of Mr. James T. Fields,
in 1871. Suéuréaiz S,ée2‘cﬂes (1871) did for Cam-
bridge what Ve7zez‘z'cm Lzfe had done for Venice,
though its descriptions of the university town were
-ess direct, and included many pieces of delicate
humor and not a few delightful character-sketches.
Every one of Mr. Howells’s books, thus far, had
increased his public of readers; but Tﬂeir I/Vm’a’z'7zg
journey (1872) multiplied them anew, and showed
him to. be, by humor and descriptive power, the best
literary painter of contemporary American life in the
better classes. A C/zcmce Acguazhtance and,A Fore-
gone C0mZusz'07z, two other novels, were equally suc.
cessful in the same vein. His later novels have
been Tﬁe Lady of Me Aroostooé (1879), Tﬁe Umz’z's-
covered Cozmiry (1880), A Femful Respo72sz'bz'lz'z‘y
(1881), Docior Bram’: Pmctzke (1881), and A Mad-
em Instance (1882). In the last of them the cheery
humor of his earlier books has been tempered by

3. INCREASE AND COTTON MATHER.—— Nearly
every minister who had anything to say and the
means of getting it printed wrote a pamphlet or
two. The titles were often of great length. Tﬂe
AppZz'az2‘z'o7z of Redeizzpfzbiz éy I/ze E ﬁctual Work of
2!/ze ‘Word and S;§z'rz'z‘ of C/zrisz‘ was as brief as the
average; and the interest excited in such works is
shown by the fact that this treatise reached a sec-
ond edition after the death of the author, the Rev.
Thomas Hooker, the founder of Hartford. -Of all

.the theological writers of the seventeenth and

eighteenth centuries, Increase Mather and his son
Cotton were the most voluminous. The publica-
tions of the former numbered eighty-ﬁve, and of the
latter no less than three hundred and eighty-two.
Increase Mather was born at Dorchester, and grad-
uated at Harvard in 1656, though he deemed an
additional European training necessary, and took a
degree at Dublin two years later. He was presi-
dent of Harvard between 1685 and 1701, and had
some success in his efforts to be preacher, diplomat,
and educator at the same time. His writings have
little literary value. Cotton Mather inherited all
his father’s zeal, together with the bookish tastes of
his grandfather, John Cotton, of the First Church in
Boston. Cotton Mather graduated at Harvard in

the realistic inﬂuence of Mr. Henry James, Jr. He
is the author of two bright comedies: Out of 272:
Que5z‘z'07z and A Cozzazmj/’ez'z‘ Presentment. In 1860
a volume called Poems of Two Frz'em/5 was written
by Mr. Howells in conjunction with J. J. Piatt.
His collected poems were afterwards issued in a
single small volume. Many of them have become
favorites, and their excellence of versiﬁcation,
especially in hexameters, is marked.

16. THEODORE WINTHROP, a native of Connecti-
cut and a graduate of Yale College, was killed in
the ﬁrst set engagement of the war, at Big Bethel,

, Virginia, on June Io, 1861. He had written a few

spirited magazine sketches, and at his death three
complete novels and a numbertof minor papers
were found among his manuscripts. The novels,
Cecil Dreeme, foﬂn B76722‘, and Ezize/2'72 Broiﬂerloﬂ,
are the breeziest and heartiest of American works
of ﬁction, and even their horses breathe a vital
oxygen. The lesser sketches ﬁll two volumes,
mostly devoted to out—door papers of camp-life and
travel.

17. EDWARD EGGLESTON, born in Indiana in 1837,
has found a special ﬁeld in novels of pioneer life
in the uncivilizedoutposts of western civilization.

itinerant and Sunday-school worker. One or two
books for children have since been found excellent,

less surprising to German readers than were Feni-
more Cooper’s Indian tales at the time of their
ﬁrst appearance. _

18. JULIAN HAWTHORNE, a son of Nathaniel
Hawthorne, born in Boston in 1846, has found his

‘advancement hindered rather than aided by the

circumstance of his birth. In his novels, Bresscmt,
Idolatry, Gartﬂ, Seoastzkziz Slrome, and Dun‘, and in
his shorter stories, Mr. Hawthorne shows his
father’s fondness for psychological and weird

‘ themes; but he treats them in a somewhat sensa-

tional manner, and overcrowds his canvas with a
confusion of ﬁgures. Mr. Hawthorne has resided
abroad of late years; and his sketches of German
and English life and character have been uncom-
monly accurate, though their truthfulness of descrip-
tion have made some of them seem the work of a
pitiless observer. These Saxon S2‘uo’z'os and E72gZz's/2
S2‘uo’z'os r are worthy continuations of the elder Haw-
thorne’s Our 0/[Z Home.

of contemporary ﬁction, describes men’s ways and
words, and leaves the reader to infer their character
therefrom. A Passzbnaie Pz'Zgrz'm contains the best
of the magazine stories he wrote during his earlier
years. Of his longer novels, Roderzké ffzm’5o7z, T/za
Amerzmrz, Wait/2 aim’ Ward, and 7726 P0rz‘raz'2‘ of a
Lady, are like highly ﬁnished statuettes, clear-cut
and cold. Mr. James never works in the “large
manner.” Some of his later stories—T/ze Euro-
peans and I/Va:/zz'7zgz‘072 Sguare—-—show a lack of that
ﬁnish by which his ﬁrst successes were won. His
Tra7zséz2‘Za7zz‘z'c Ska‘;/zes consist of the best of his con-
tributions ‘from abroad to American magazines and

. newspapers.

2o. ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS, a daughter of

Professor Austin Phelps of the theological seminary

at Andover, is another of the writers of the remark—
able short stories which distinguish the present
time. The -chief of her lesser tales are collected
in 111672, Women, and Gﬂoszﬂs‘ (1869). Besides many
Sunday-school stories, Miss Phelps has written ﬁve
novels, Héafgred [72 (1870), 2726 Silem‘ Pczrlizer (1871),
7726 Siory of A212’; (1877), a dramatic and highly-
wrought record of the struggles of a woman’s soul,
Frz'.em2’5.- a D2162‘ (1881), and Dodo)’ Zczy (1882).
Miss Phelps’s somewhat infrequent poems are co1~
lected in a volume called Poezzkal Sz‘uzZz'es. 7726 Gates
Afar, an original book on heaven, made a great
literary sensation in 1868.

OTHER N0 If/ELJS TS. 103

21. LOUISA MAY ALcoTT, a daughter of A. B.
Alcott, is the best of American writers of juveniles.
lz'z‘z‘Ze Women (1867) attained quick popularity. Its
success in describing girl-life lay in its entire free-
dom from artiﬁciality and its cheeriness of spirit.
Miss Alcott’s literary style is wholly natural, and
she seems to take genuine pleasure in the charac-
ters she creates. The bright New England boy
and girl Miss Alcott knows very well, and her
light humor and fertility of invention have made her
other books for the young (eleven in number) equal
favorites. Their merit is nearly uniform, and their
readers are of all ages. Miss Alcott’s considerable

‘novel of Work and her stories andlsketches of adult

life promise "an elaborate work of ﬁction in the
future.

22. HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD (born Harriet
Elizabeth Prescott) is notable for the splendor of

‘her style and the almost unhealthy luxuriance of

her fancy. Sir Roﬂcmh‘ G/zosz‘ (1859), Tﬁe Amber

in book form, though they represent but a small
part of her printed writings. As the best example
of her great powers of construction and elaboration
may be mentioned the story of jlIz'zz’summer mm’
May, in the Amber Gods volume. A volume of
Mrs. Spofford’s poems was published in 1881.

short stories called Olzl Creole Days, and in his
longer Tﬂe Grcmo’z'ssz'mes and llforlczme Del;/zz'72e, well
introduces a new element in American ﬁction ——the
Creole life of Louisiana. Judge Albion W. Tour-
gee achieved, during the political campaign of 1880,
the greatest popular success since Uncle Tom’s
Cczoirz, in A I7ool’s Errand and Bricks ze/ll/zozll
Straw, in which he set forth with satirical strength
the alleged difﬁculties attending the attempt of
Northern residents to settle in the “reconstructed”
Southern states. Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen, a young
Norwegian who has resided in this country of late
years, has written in English clear and beautiful

‘ stories of his native land, of which Gumzor, oz Norse

Romor/tee is the chief. In ﬁction, as in poetry, the
‘number of recent female authors of merit is large.
Mrs. Rebecca Harding Davis, the author of Mar-
gret Ifoze/2% and I/I/oz'z‘zA'72g for 2‘/ze Verzlz'a‘, has great
power in the delineation of the sad and solemn
sides of life, especially in the lower classes. Mrs.
Richard S. Greenough’s stories have a sombre hue
and an artistic ﬁnish. Mrs. Adeline D. T. Whit-
ney’s Leslie Golzll/zzoaz'le is 21 lovely picture of young
girlhood, which the author has illustrated in several
other stories. Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton’s
Some I/Vome72’s Hearts is a collection of novelettes

magazines, produced in 1877 T/zoz‘ Loss 0’ Loze/rz'e’s.

and T/zrougiz 0/ze Azz’m2'72z'sz‘miz'o7z have shown a
marked, though not a steady, growth in the nov-
elist’s art. The last two books, and some of the
author’s shorter stories, are descriptive, of the better
andthe worse phases of Southern American life.
Three novels by the late Mrs. Anne M. Crane
Seemuller, of Baltimore, deserve mention for their
morbid strength: Emz'Z_y C/zesier, Opporfunzzy, and

24. AMERICAN HUMOR.-— There has never been
any lack of humor in American literature, from the
time of Richard Alsop and the Hartford wits down
to the latest newspaper paragraphs. It has been
individual rather than general and its rapidity of

  thought is its chief characteristic. Our lack of a

literary centre has denied us any Pzmck or Klan’-
(z’e*7'azz’a2‘s(/z, but as a compensation every country
paper keeps its own clown. A really witty saying
goes from Eastport to San Francisco, and thus a
Seba Smith (“ Major Jack Downing”), B. P. Shilla-
ber (“ Mrs. Partington ”), or George D. Prentice is
likely to ﬁnd his public greater than his reputation,
and his reputation more generous than his purse.
Our later humorists have won their celebrity by the
constant publication of longer sketches, good, bad,

106 A RRJMER 01-" AMERICAN LITERA TURE,

or indifferent, being only careful that the name go
with the sketch, and that the sketch be individual
enough and long enough to keep out of the pro-
miscuous limbo of popular quotation. George H.
Derby (“John Phoenix”) was born in Massachu-
setts in 1823, and graduated at West Point in 1846.

His wit was genuine and all his own, and his Cal-.

ifornia sketches made delightful fun of that region
in the gold-mining excitement of 1849. Perhaps
his cleverest achievement was his issue of an illus.
trated journal, in which the familiar little advertise
ing cuts of the daily papers were made to do duty
in all sorts of odd fashions. Charles F arrariBrowne

(“Artemus Ward”) was born at Waterford, Maine,

in 1834. His humor was of an uneven quality, and
was often coarse; but toward the last of his life he
so ripened and mellowed that his popular nickname
of “Artemus the delicious” was not wholly inap-

.propriate. He first popularized misspelling in

America, and in View of this fact we may call his
best saying the remark that “Chaucer was a great
poet, but he couldn’t spell.” Browne won much
success as a lecturer, and died in England in 1867,
having made himself a great favorite in London,
where he served for some time onithe staff of
Pzmc/z. Henry W, Shaw (“Josh Billings”), born
in Massachusetts in 1818, is chieﬂy known as the
Writer of proverbs and aphorisms, in which wit and
v.+.i.i:-4.1.3131 are neatly combined. They are, like

AM.ER1cA./V HUMOR. 1o7

Artemus Ward’s sayings, in phonetic spelling, but
gain nothing by their presentation in uncouth form.
David Ross Locke was born in Vestal, Broome
County, New York, in 1833, and in his early years
led a varied life as a country printer and editor.
In 1860 he began the publication of letters by
“Petroleum V. Nasby,” an entirely original char-
acter, whose epistles became famous during the
war, and exerted a very considerable political in-
ﬂuence. . Locke -is the chief political satirist of the
time, and Nasby, whether pastor, reformer, work-
ingman, or member of society, is a constant cari-
cature of the ideas for which he stands. Unlike

other national satirical humorists taking public

affairs for their theme, Locke is facile in turning
to the most recent questions with unabated strength
and undimmed humor. Another humorist, writing
during the war upon political themes, but choosing

~ subjects of a more local character, and having a

less deﬁnite purpose in his satire, was Robert H.
Newell (“Orpheus C. Kerr”), a native of New
York city. Samuel Langhorne Clemens (“Mark
Twain”), like so many other humorists, first at-
tracted attention in California. T/ze Imzocents

of a somewhat whimsical expedition which had

1678, and, having overcome a painful habit of stam~‘
mering, became his father’s colleague in the North
Church, Boston, in 1684. The youth was then only

’ twenty-one years of age, but his head had been

crammediwith as much knowledge as John Mi1ton’s.
At twelve he was well along in Hebrew, and had
mastered the leading Latin and Greek authors; and
his daily life was from the ﬁrst a wonderful piece of
systematic machinery. Mather was a ﬁrm supporter
of the doctrines of extreme Calvinistic theology, and
to him devils and angels were as real as his own
family. In witchcraft he fully believed, in common
with most of the wise men of his time; and his ﬁrst

‘important book, Memorable Proz/zkleizces reZcz2‘z'7zg to

I/Vz'z‘c/zcmfz‘, appeared in 1689, three years before the
Salem executions, which Mather justiﬁed. T/ze
Wonders of 2726 [727/z's,z'éZe I/I/aria’, issued in 1693, gives
an account of these executions, without any attempt

i at compassion, or any intimation that human beings,

and not evil spirits, were being put to death. And
yet this cold, stern man was a life—long worker for
sailors, prisoners, Indians, and all the suffering and
oppressed. Mather wrote on a multitude of sub-
jects, but the work on which his reputation chieﬂy
rests is the Zllagmzlzkz C/zrz'52‘z' Americcma, published
in London in 17o2,—a vast storehouse of ecclesi-
astical, civil, and educational history, together with
many biographical sketches. As a collection of
facts it is an authority; and in those passages

less successful. The qualities of Mr. Clemens’s
style are peculiar, slyness and adroitness in jesting
being prominent, so that the reader is treated to a
constant succession of surprises.

2 5. CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER is a humorist of a
more delicate type than those just mentioned. He
was born in Plainﬁeld, Massachusetts, in 1829, and
graduated at Hamilton College, in 1851. 11!} Sum-
mer in a Garden, 21 series of delightful sketches of
amateur horticulture, ﬁrst made him famous. Bark
log Sz‘zm’z'es, domestic and moralreﬂections, was less
popular, but equally successful. Eaddecé, am! T/zal
Sort of T/ziizg followed, being an account of a trip to

A the provinces of British North America. Its little

bits of fun and humor are scattered all through the
book, and are to be enjoyed in exact proportion to
the reader’s own tastes. Illzmmzies aim’ ./l[0.S‘[€77Z.S‘, I72
2‘/ze Lezmzz‘, and Sauzz/erzhgs similarly, though a little
more soberly, illuminate life in Oriental and Euro-
pean countries visited by the author. In Bang

a Boy (1877) Mr. Warner draws the New England

youngster to the. life.

26. JAMES PARTON, a native of England but long
a resident of America, has devoted the greater part
of his literary life to the production of biographies
of prominent men, written after a careful collation of
authorities, but addressed to the popular taste in
their ﬂuent style and attractive allusion. Aaron

Iefferson, General Butler, and Horace Greeley have
thus been described in volumes of considerable size,
while a single volume has been compiled from simi-
lar biographical sketches of less length. Mr. Parton
has also edited serviceable collections of humorous
poetryand French lyrics, and has prepared a gen-
eral history of caricature and caricaturists, besides
an elaborate life of Voltaire. H

27. EDWARD E. HALE, born in Boston in 1822,
of a family well known in the literary history of that
city, has written a large number of very readable
and ingenious stories, of which Tm Times 0226 is
«Tan is the longest, a tale made famous by the
cheery motto of its hero, Harry Wadsworth. Mr.
Hale’s short sketch of A Maiz wiz‘/zouz‘ a Country is
the most remarkable piece of verisimilitude pro-
duced on this side the water. It exerted a marked

inﬂuence in strengthening the Northern arms dur-

ing the war. In P/1272} A/‘oldie’: Frzimzis Mr. Hale
has written a continuous novel of some length,
marked by his usual cleverness of plot and phrase.

28. THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON, a descend-
ant of one of the most ancient of Massachusetts
families, and a Harvard graduate of» 1841, is an

lightful companion in his Out-Door Papers (1863)
and 0Zzz’;§0rz‘ Day: (1873), volumes made up chieﬂy
of articles concerning this or that phase of out-door
life. In Atlantic Essays‘ (1871) there is a greater

proportion of papers on classical or literary subjects.
Colonel Higginson was at the head of a colored
regiment between 1862 and 1864, having been all
his life an active opponent of slavery. Army L2}?

lina experiences. In his I/olzmg Folks’ Ifislory of Me
U7zz'z‘ezz’ Sfcztes (187 5) he presents, w.ithin small com-
pass, a readable and impartial story of the growth
of the country. Ma/50223 (1869), a romance of N ew-.

J port life, is his only novel.

29. MISCELLANEOUS WRITERs.—A few authors
remain to be mentioned, who cannot conveniently

be classed under any special head. Edmund

Quincy, who was born in r8o8 and died in 1877,
was a constant contributor of unsigned articles to
the periodical press, and wrote a forgotten but mer-
itorious novel,. Wensley, in 1853. He will longest
be remembered, however, as the author of a life of
his father, President Josiah Quincy, of Harvard.
This biography is a thoroughly charming history of
a man whom James Russell Lowell properly calls
“a great public character.” James T. Fields, of
Boston, enjoyed the acquaintance of more English
and American authors than any other of our writers,
and he preserved some of his entertaining remi-
niscences in Yes2‘em’czys wiz‘/z Azzzﬁors. In Um/67¢
ﬁrzzsﬁ (1877) are contained his lighter essays and
sketches. His poems, though not many, were care-
fully written, and are of pleasing quality. Mary

which are colored by the writer’s prejudices it is
easy to detach the true from the false. Mather
died in 1728, and left a great gap in the literature
and theology of the time. By his side the other
early clergymen of New England, with two excep
tions, must take an inferior place, for they equalled
him in zeal and fertility, but not in ability.

coming to Boston in 1631, and accepting as his
life-mission, the next year, the conversion of the
Indians, who were evidently, in his opinion, the

' descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. Having

learned the language by the aid of an Indian
servant in his family, he began preaching in No
nantum, now Newton, in 1646. Threats did not
affect him, and little churches of natives were
slowly gathered in the Massachusetts Bay and
Plymouth colonies, twenty-four of his converts aid-
ing the industrious Eliot in carrying them on. He
had troubles with the colonists, whom he deterred
from extirpating the Indians in 1675, and whom
he offended by his C/zrz'siz'cm Commonwealiﬂ, pub-
lished in England in 1660,-——a work against which
seditious intent was charged. Eliot wrote an Eng-
lish harmony of the Gospels, an Indian grammar,
and some lesser works; but his chief monument
of industry and scholarship is his translation of the

is likely to have no slight effect upon the popular comprehension of the ii-{‘1'ner..
itance and duties of the American citizen. The educational inﬂuence of such
books is, in fact, not to be easily overestimated. . . . To young men, especially
they will form a political library of the utmost value.” — Boston Traveller. ,

entire Bible into the Indian tongue. This appeared
in two parts, the New Testament in 1661, and the
whole Bible in 1663, and was the labor of the un-
aided Eliot. Its dialect is now unknown save to
an antiquary or two. This work is also noticeable
as the ﬁrst Bible, in any language, printed in British
America, and still remains one of the most remark-
able contributions to philology made in this country,

though its value as a Christianizing agent was of '

course temporary.

5. ROGER W1LLIAMs.—The Puritans, although
they were in a majority, and controlled religious
and social affairs in New England with an iron
hand, were not without opponents. Of these,
Roger Williams, a Church of England clergyman
who had become a non-conformist just before sail-.
ing for America, in 1630, was the most prominent.

_ For ﬁve years he was in every way a political and

theological thorn in the side of the colony, though
many of his principles were thoroughly in accord
with what is now considered truth and progress.
To escape banishment to England he went, with
four followers, to the site of the present city of

Providence, and set up a community in which secu--

lar and religious affairs were divorced. Becoming
a Baptist in 1639, he founded a church the same
year, which he quitted after a few months. The
remainder of his life was mainly spent in Provi-
dence, though. he lived in London for some time,

}1. A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

where he was surprised to ﬁnd John Milton as ver-  

satile as himself, and considerably more profound.
The Quakers were freely admitted to Providence,
but Williams and George Fox carried on sharp con-
troversies, and the former willingly engaged in
public debate with the Quaker champion. His

of C/zrz'sz"s and Experz'me7z2‘s of Spz'rz'2‘z¢aZ ZW cmzi
ﬂczllﬁ are his principal works, but their present
value is not great. Williams’s whole career shows
what a man of sincerity and force can accomplish,
though his powers be hindered by a certain insta-
bility and superﬁciality.

' 6. MINOR WRITERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CEN-
TURY.-— Captain John Smith was a voluminous but
untrustworthy narrator of his own adventures.
Nathaniel Ward, minister at Ipswich, published in
1647 a sharp satire on English social life, called

‘The Simple Coééler of Agczze/am. Governor John

Winthrop’s valuable history of New England, in the
form of a journal between 1630 and 1649, was not
fully published until 1826. The manuscript of
another governor’s journal, William Bradfordls Z12’:-
lory of Plymom‘/2 PZa7zz‘czz‘z'07z (I602-41646), a still
abler work, was lost until 18 5 5, and ﬁrst completely
published in 1856. It had formed the basis of
Nathaniel Morton’s .ZV€‘Z€/ England’: Memorzkzl, I669.
The honor of the ﬁrst publication of a volume of
poems in New England belongs to Anne Bradstreet;

YALE COLLEGE. I 5

whose collected works appeared in 1678. Some of
the poems are by no means devoid of merit, though
disﬁgured by a paucity of words and a stiffness of
style. Peter Folger, Benjamin Franklin’s'grand-
father, also wrote a long doggerel entitled A Look-
ing Glass for Me Times. It was hard to write any-
thing but doggerel so long as the current versions
of the Psalms were in vogue. Michael Wiggles-
worth"s Day of Doom (1662) is a solemn poem on
the day of judgment, with some strong lines, one of
which devotes to non-elect infants “the easiest
room in hell.” It was very popular in its day, run-
ning through nine editions in America and two in
England.

.7. YALE COLLEGE.—- In the year 1700 some Con-
necticut ministers met at New Haven, and talked
over the plan of establishing a college in the
colony, a subject which had been broached as early
as 1647. Meeting again in Branford the same
year, they deposited forty books on a table, each
declaring as he laid down his parcel, “ I give these
books for the founding a college in this colony.”
In its early years the new institution led a wander-
ing and not altogether peaceful life at Killingworth,
Saybrook, and Milford, but was ﬁnally located in
New Haven in 17:6. The Saybrook Platform
(Congregational) had been made binding on the

at Harvard, even in the eighteenth century; but

the publications of its officers and graduates were
fewer, partly in consequence of the lack of a pub-
lishing centre in the colony. Philosophy, however,
was from the ﬁrst a prominent study, and to this
fact is due, in some measure, the subsequent career
of the most eminent of American metaphysicians.

8. JONATHAN EDWARDS was born in East Wind~
sor, Connecticut, in 1703, graduated at Yale in
1720, was a tutor there between 1724 and 1726,
was pastor in Northampton and Stockbridge, and
was elected president of the College of New Jersey
at Princeton, in 1757, dying there in March of

the next year, after holding office less than three

months. As a mere youth he began the study of
mental science, and took up the task of showing
the harmony between the Calvinistic theology and

_ the conclusions of philosophy. Locke he mastered

at thirteen, and afterwards studied all other acces-
sible authorities; but Locke’s inﬂuence was always
strong in his mind. In 1746 he wrote a Treatzke 072
t/ze ReZz;grz'./ms A/j‘Iecz‘z'om, in which he showed what
were the marks of true religion. A72 I7zguz'ry 2'm‘o

2‘/ze Qualzﬁcaﬂmzs for Full C0mmum'o7z followed; a‘

work in which he laid down the principle, since
maintained in the New England Congregational
churches, that true conversion and a correct life
should be requisites for admission to the Lord’s
Supper. This opinion was not shared by his

Northampton church, and he was compelled to
leave it and accept the duties of missionary to
the Stockbridge Indians. In Stockbridge, between
1751 and 17 54, he wrote his great treatise on the
freedom of the will, the full title of which was A
Careful and Siriez‘ Inquiry 2'7z2‘o Me Modern ./Voiiorz
13;’ that Freedom of 1/1/27! ze/}zz'e/z is supposed la be essen-
tial to Moral Agemy, Vz'rz‘ae aiza’ Vice, Rewara’ and
Pzmis/zmem‘, Praise aiza’ Blame. His other works
were not few, but upon this chieﬂy rests his repu-
tation as philosopher and theologian. It was
designed to show that Calvinistic notions of God’s
moral government are not Contrary to the common-
sense of mankind, but in strict consonance there-
with. Edwards maintained that the will is not
self-determined, and that the assertion of absence
of certainty in the universe is inconsistent with an};

correct idea of a ruling power. Some English

necessitarians promptly hailed Edwards as one of
their number, but he ‘repudiated the connection,
and declared that man’s sinful disposition was
man’s greatest sin, far from being an excuse for
wrong-doing. From its ﬁrst appearance until the
present time‘ the treatise has been the subject of
sharp criticism, both by Calvinists and Arminians,
but it has been supported by some of the ablest of
American divines.

9. THE FoLLowERs or EDWARDS.-— The principal
leaders, in the eighteenth century, of the school of

18 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

philosophy which Edwards shaped were Samuel
Hopkins, Nathaniel Emmons, and Timothy Dwight.
Hopkins studied theology under Edwards, of whom
he published a biography. His System of T/zeologj
appeared in 1793, and “Hopkinsianism” Was a
common term in New England for many. years.
Hopkins was one of the first to oppose slavery;

_ he caused it to be abolished in Rhode Island, and

formed a plan for colonizing and evangelizing
Africa with free negroes. Emmons was pastor of
a church in Franklin, Massachusetts, from 1773 to
1840, and his writings were in substantial accord
with those of Dr. Hopkins. Timothy Dwight was

president of Yale between 1795 and 1817 His

T/zeology Explczzhea’ and Defemiea’ (1818) consisted
of one hundred and seventy-three sermons. While
adhering in the main to the principles of Edwards,
he dissented in minor points, and considerably

I popularized the system. Dr. Dwight, who was one

of the most accomplished scholars of his time, also
wrote poetry and a book of travels, though his ex-
plorations extended no farther than New England
and New York.

IO. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.——The eighteenth cen«
tury had now become rich in the names of great
Americans, one of the most remarkable of whom

was Benjamin Franklin, who had all the versatility ‘

of Roger Williams and Increase Mather, and was
a master in whatever branch of learning he touched  

BEZV_/AZIIIZV FRAZVATLIA/'. I 9

Franklin, the ﬁfteenth of a family of seventeen
children, was born in_ Boston in 1706, his father
being a tallow-chandler and his mother the daugh-
ter of Peter Folger, a man of some literary ability.
Early apprenticed to his brother James as a printer,
Franklin read everything he could lay hands upon,
and was especially fond of Addison’s Speetaior, then
a great favorite and a novelty. The itch for writing
was soon manifest, and he began to print pieces
on public affairs in The ./Vew Eizglcma’ Couram‘,
his brother’s newspaper. The people read and
liked them, but they caused a, disagreement with
his brother, and in 1723 young Franklin ran away
to New York and Philadelphia, where he went to
work as a journeyman printer. In 1730 he bought
the PemzsyZ72cz7zz'ez Gazette, then two years old, and
soon became a power in politics, literature, and

society. Through his efforts a library was started

in Philadelphia in 1731; the American Philosoph-
ical Society in 1743, and the Academy of Philadel-
phia, afterwards the University of Pennsylvania, in
1749. In 1753 he became postmaster—general for
the colonies, and was frequently commissioner be-
tween them and England. In 1766 he   secured the
repeal of the obnoxious Stamp Act; in 1775 he
went to the Continental Congress; and in 1776 he
helped to draft the Declaration of Independence,
which he signed. Between that year and 178 5 he
was employed abroad in various diplomatic func-

20 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

tions, returning in time to be a delegate to the Con-
stitutional Convention in 1787. He died at Phila-=
delphia in 1790.

11. FRANKLIN AS A WRITER.—A Dz'sserz‘czz‘z'o7z on
lz'5erz‘y and ./\7ecessz'z‘y was printed by Franklin in
London in 172 5, during a temporary residence in
that city, being a _reply to a work by William
Wollaston on which the young printer was setting
type. In I732 Franklin began, in Philadelphia,

:the publication of Poor Ric/zam”s Almanac, the

issue of which was continued for twenty-ﬁve years.
“Richard Saunders, Philomath” was the professed

author, and Benjamin Franklin was the printer.

The principal part of the almanac was a collection
of saws and sayings, which were eagerly awaited
by the people, and promptly passed into current
circulation. The inculcation of practices of pru-

_ dence and economy was always a leading idea in

these maxims, and they had a prompt effect in
increasing the amount of spare money in Phila-
delphia. Besides these, the almanacs contained
jocose introductions and doggerel rhymes for each
month. The annual sale was about ten thousand
copies, but they were so worn out bytheir homely
readers that copies of the earlier issues are scarce.
The most of Franklin’s other writings consisted of
miscellaneous and random, but by no means hasty,
papers on political, ﬁnancial, social, and scientiﬁc
subjects, all of which have been preserved. T/z:

Busyboriy, a series of essays in Addisonian style,
and some ballads written in early life, should also
be mentioned. Franklin was an admirable letter-
writer, and in his correspondence a perfect picture
of the man is presented. If anything further were
needed to complete our idea of his personality, it is
supplied in his Auz‘o5z°0gm;%y.

I2. FRANKLIN AS A SCIENTIST AND DIPLOMA-
TIsT'.——To Franklin belongs the honor of showing
that lightning is electricity, and the invention of
the lightning-rod. About the year 1750 he fore-
shadowed this discovery in his letters, and was
elected a fellow of the Royal Society in conse-

quence of his papers on the subject. In foreign

courts his inﬂuence was largely due to personal
power, but as a political writer he is clear and
cogent. ’

I3. MINOR WRITERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CEN-
TURY.—- An excellent I{2's2‘ory of Me Fz'rs2‘ Discoz/ery
cma’ Seltlemem‘ of I/z'rgz'm'cz was published in 1747
by William Stith, afterwards president of William
and Mary College. David Brainerd, a missionary
to the Indians of New England and New York, kept
a diary, which was issued after his death, and is an
interesting history of the life of a sensitive, indus-
trious, and devout man. These memoirs were
edited by Jonathan Edwards. John Woolman, an
itinerant Quaker, born in New Jersey, wrote little,
his principal literary production being, like Brain-

erd’s, in the form of personal recollections. His
foumal of Lg’/Te and Travel: in Me. Sen/2'56 of 2‘/ze
Gospel appeared in 1774, three years after his
death. It is a charming book. Thomas Prince,
a minister of the Old South Church, Boston, from
1718 to 1758, planned a Cﬁroizo/ogzkal I{z'.s'z‘0ry of
./Vew Eizgla/212’, in the form of annals, from 1603 to
1730, but only brought the work down to 1633. It
was his intention to present a bare chronicle of
facts, but in passages he rose to a certain elo-
quence of historic portrayal. Chief Justice Samuel
Sewall, of Boston, was a prominent man in the
colony, and wrote several books; his best literary

lwork, however, was his full Diary from 167.4 to

1729, ﬁrst published by the Massachusetts Histori-
cal Society in 1878-1881. Sincere, graphic, devout,
and shrewd, these note-books of Judge Sewall’s
present an important picture of Puritan life in the

I seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and are the

most remarkable contribution ever made by a diarist
to American social history.

CHAPTER II.
1775-1812.

I. THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD.-The American
‘{evolution was the cause of much commotion in
literature as wel.l as in politics, being preceded,
attended, and followed by great activity of the pen.
A large part of the books and pamphlets written
at the time were necessarily of temporary interest

O and of slight value as literature. But such of the

speeches, delivered during or before the meeting of
the Continental Congress, as have come down to
us are marked by the ﬁre and intensity of an ear-
nest period. James Otis, of Boston, born in 1725,
was the author of some vigorous pamphlets, and
was a wonderful orator. A few fragments of his
speeches have been preserved, but the one which is
most familiar to school-boys is an avowed modern.
imitation. Josiah Quincy, Jr. (1744-1775), shared
with Otis, in Massachusetts, the oratorical honors
of the time. John Adams wrote some powerful
pamphlets, and Patrick Henry, like Otis, deserves
literary mention for the fervid eloquence and artis-
tic ﬁnish of his speeches.

24 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

2. GEORGE WASHINGTON AS A WR1TER.——Though
Washington at no time in his life paid particular
attention to the arts of rhetoric, he was the master

of a clear and somewhat individual style. Without ,

including many productions of special interest, his
literary remains are suﬂicient to ﬁll twelve large
volumes. The journal of his expedition to the
Ohio River was published at Williamsburg, Virginia,
in 1.754, and his Farewell Address in ,1796,——a pro-
duction which would alone entitle the writer to
mention among American authors. The rest of
his collected works consist of addresses, messages,
and correspondence. As a letter-writer Washington

«excelled, like Franklin; and during his life-time

he was compelled to make out a list of spurious
letters attributed to him, the popularity of his
correspondence having led to such forgeries.

3. THOMAS JEFFERSON was probably the best

* educated man of his time, having been fortunate

in his instructors and zealous in the prosecution
of his studies. Many branches of learning he had
pursued beyond the usual limit, and he excelled in
literary composition, though he was no orator. His
[Votes on V2'rgz'7zz'a were written for the information
of the French government, and were published
in 1784. They include many shrewd observations
and interesting suggestions. ]efferson’s somewhat
voluminous correspondence may be considered his
most graceful literary monument, though the Decla

THE FEDERALISTI 25

ration of Independence, which he wrote, will always
be considered one of the most remarkable of public
documents, aside from its political importance.

4. THE FEDERALIST was a collection of essays
published periodically, and arguing in favor of the
Constitution of the United States, adopted in 1789.
There were eighty-ﬁve numbers in all, of which the
first seventy-six appeared in 2726 ]7z(Zepe72(z’e7zz‘_]0ur7mZ,
a semi-weekly newspaper published in New York.
The publication began on October 27, 1787, and
ceased, as far as the journal was concerned, on
April 2, 1788. 2726 Fm’emZz'sz‘ was the concerted
work of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and

‘John Jay, who adopted no separate signatures, but

wrote over the common signature of Publius. The
letters were addressed to the people of New York,

in order to induce that State to support the pro-

posed national Constitution. The purpose of the

A publication was controversial, for the Constitution

had been so sharply attacked that its friends per-
ceived the necessity of rallying to its defence. The
original idea was Ha1nilton’s, and he drew up the
plan of the series. The completed work does not
form a systematic treatise,_ but covers many ques-
tions of government which every student of political
science must consider. The authors had a special
end in view, and they were zealous to show the
colonists that advantage and danger united in de-
manding the adoption of a Federal Constitution. In

26 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERA TURE.

the light of later experience the wisdom and fore~
thought of the writers are apparent. The work has
been repeatedly issued, and is recognized as a
standard authority on the elementary principles of
government.

5. THOMAS PAINE was a prominent ﬁgure in Rev-
olutionary literature. Born in England in 1737, he
started in life as a stay-make_r and dissenting
preacher, meanwhile getting a general knowledge
of literature by such promiscuous reading as he
could do at odd moments. Becoming angry with
the British government in consequence of his dis-
missal from the revenue service, he came to America

‘ in 1774 and obtained speedy notoriety as a political
‘writer. His Serious Tﬂoug/12‘: 072 S/awry was a

magazine article printed in 1775. C077Z77Z07Z Same,
a political pamphlet, advocating a declaration of
independence and the formation of a republic, had
a Vast circulation, and exerted no small inﬂuence.
At the end of 1776 Paine started a periodical
called T/ze Criszlv, which was published, at no stated
interval, for some time, and had a multitude of
readers. His patriotic services during the war were
appreciated and rewarded, though his temper got
him into occasional trouble. T/ze [Bag/22‘: of./Ila/2, a
vindication of the French Revolution, appeared in
1791 and 1792, and he wrote 2726 Age qfkeason in
1794 and 1795, partly in a French prison. The
latter work has always had a wide circulation,

POE rs. J 27

chieﬂy among the lower classes. It advocates a
pure deism, but its method of criticism and temper
of attack are now generally repudiated by more
scholarly writers of the same school.

6. PoETs.— Philip Freneau, a Huguenot by de-
scent and a New Yorker by birth, was the ﬁrst
American poet to attain eminence, though there
were a multitude of anonymous ballad-writers dur«
ing the war. Freneau graduated at the College of
New Jersey in 1771, studying at that institution
with James Madison. He published four volumes,
and his political burlesques were very popular dur-
ing the war. Probably he was the ﬁrst American

poet to ﬁnd readers in England. John Trumbull’s

Progress of Du!/zzess and Elegy on Me Times attracted
no great attention; but his ]l[eFz'7zgaZ (1782), a
satirical poem in the style of Butler’s Hudz'bras,
had a great circulation. Some of its lines are still

i popularly assigned to Butler. Francis Hopkinson

and Robert Treat Paine, Jr., were other patriotic
and ‘humorous versiﬁers. Joel Barlow’s Vz'sz'o7z of
Celzmzbzes (1787) was for a time a favorite, and his
graver Colzmzém/Z, an expansion of the preceding,
issued in 1808, was the ﬁrst attempt. at a national
epic. It is stiff and stately, but occasionally rises
into merit. Barlow is better known by a poem on
“hasty-pudding.” Phillis Wheatiey, a Massachu-
setts negress, published a volume of verse in Lon-
don in 1773; and Dr. James McCl:;rg, of Virginia,

wrote graceful poems of compliment. But all tho
American poetry of the time, even the most patri-
otic, was in humble imitation of English models.

7. THE FIRST NovELIsT.———Charles Brockden
Brown’s I/Vz'e/cma’, printed in 1798, introduced ﬁc-
tion into American literature. The slow appear-
ance of the novel was not strange, for, with the
exception of De Foe, the English novelists them-
selves had failed to win much celebrity before the
latter half of the eighteenth century. Ormmm’ was
Brown’s second novel, and the two books received
prompt approval. Art/zzzr Illa/*7/yiz, the third novel,
was equally successful, and a better story than

- either. All Brown’s stories are told in a graphic

style, and their author had no lack of imagination.
Later Writers have supplanted him, and the prevail-
ing impression of gloom left by his books has not
served to make them permanent favorites. Brown,

* it should be added, started a monthly magazine,

and was the ﬁrst of our authors to make his whole
living out of literature. .

leave this fact as its only distinction. Dr. Abiel
Holmes’s Amzals of Amerzkcz is of service as a sys-
tematic compilation of leading events. In biog»
raphy, William Wirt wrote a readable life of Patrick
Henry; and Chief Justice John Marshall prepared
a standard life of Washington. John Ledyard, a
daring explorer, started the fashion for travel by
publishing the records of his exploits. Scientiﬁc
research was given a start by the writings of Dr.
Benjamin Rush in medicine, Alexander Wilson in
ornithology, Samuel Latham Mitchill in chemistry,
Benjamin Smith Barton in botany, and Benjamin
Thompson, Count Rumford, in physics. Some of
the writers of this time would not attract attention
nowadays, and not all, even, of those here men-
tioned, wrote as well as later authors whose names
will be necessarily omitted in this book. Washing-

ton Irving once jocosely said of himself that he

attracted attention because Englishmen were sur-
prised to see an American with a quill in his hand
and not on his head. But greater credit always
belongs to the pioneer; and it must be remembered
that many authors of the eighteenth century wrote
with meagre libraries, with a slender reading public
to address, with no possibility of making literature
a livelihood, and with greater competition from
foreign sources than that of which complaint is
still made.

CHAPTER III.
1812-1861.

I. THEOLOGICAL CHANGES.-—-The increasing im-
portance of political affairs, together with the growth
in size and prosperity of the whole nation, served
to deprive theology of its preeminent place in Amer~
ican literature, though only the relative number of

volumes on religious subjects was diminished. The
beginning of the present century, however, was

marked by a considerable controversial excitement
among the New England clergy, incident to the
spread of Unitarian views in and around Boston.
Harvard University was the centre of interest, and

— the election of a Unitarian to the Hollis professor-

ship of divinity in that institution, in 1805, excited
great attention. The change in the Congregational
churches of Massachusetts had been a gradual one,
for, as James Russell Lowell has pointed out, many
of the Congregational divines of Boston and Cam-
bridge had been regarded with suspicion by their
stricter brethren, even during the eighteenth cen-
tury. In 1785, the very year of the appearance of
the ﬁrst American Episcopal prayer—book, King’s
Chapel, in Boston, the pioneer Episcopal society in

TIIEOLOGICAL CIIAZVGES. 31

New England, had stricken out all Trinitarian ex-
pressions from its liturgy; while as early as 1718
an Arian had been ordained over the Hingham
church. The war of pamphlets and books began
in 1812, simultaneously with the second conflict
between England and the United States. The
Unitarian leaders were William Ellery Channing,
the Henry Wares, father and son, and Andrews
Norton; while the conservative Congregationalists
were championed by Samuel Worcester, of Salem,
and Moses Stuart and Leonard Woods, professors
in the theological seminary at Andover. T /lze Pano-
plisz‘ was established as the Trinitarian and 2726
C/zrz's2‘z'cm Exammer as the Unitarian organ; and
the discussion was carried on with great ability on
both sides, and with a suitable degree or courtesy,
though it was impossible to debate matters in which
the nature of God and the destiny of the soul were
concerned without considerable earnestness of 1an~
guage. In! later years Ly-man Beecher,.the Alex-
anders and Professor Charles Hodge, of the Pres-
byterian seminary at Princeton, William G. T. Shedd,
of Andover Seminary, President Hopkins, of Will-
iams College, Dr. Nehemiah Adams, of Boston, D”.
John Todd, of Pittsﬁelcl, and Professor Edwards A.
Park, of Andover, have written in defence of the
Trinitarian side. More recent Unitarian writers
have been Orville Dewey, William H. Furness,
Iames Freeman Clarke. Henry W. Bellows, Andrew

- P. Peabody, and William Rounseville Alger. The

Unitarians themselves have not desired to keep
within their denominational limits such persons as

could ﬁnd greater freedom of thought outside; and ,

Theodore Parker, though remaining to the end of
his life a devout and earnest theist, in his latter
years ceased to Work in connection with any organ-
ized branch of Christianity. Parker was born at
Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1810, was a prodigy
of general learning and a marvel of industry, and
excelled both as a preacher and a writer. In 1844
he was refused admission to several Unitarian pul-
pits in Boston, and during that and subsequent years

the interest in his extremely radical views caused

the last religious excitement which had any general
effect on American literature. Parker died at Flor-
ence in 1860.

2. WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING, of the writers

I we have named, deserves the most prominent men-

tion in a literary history. He was born at New-
port ‘in 1780, and although of slight ﬁgure and not
very ﬁrm health, he began to be a hard student at
an early age, graduating at Harvard when he was
eighteen. His health was then somewhat impaired,
and he Went to Virginia as a teacher; but the return
voyage, in 1800, was so severe that he remained
a permanent invalid all his life. In 1803 he
became pastor of a Boston church, and soon was
famous as a ﬁnished orator. His style was nothing

WILLIAM ELLERY CHAZVNI./VG. 33

less than charming, and his Remarks on the Life and

C/zaraotor of Napoleon Bonaparte, published in 1828, i

gave him a European reputation. Many of his
sermons were published, and he was continually

‘ giving addresses at ordinations and literary anni-

versaries, which occasions he used to make notable
by the presentation of carefully prepared opinions
on the leading religious and political questions of
the time. He had returned from Virginia an un-
compromising opponent of slavery, and he argued
against it to the day of his death. Strange to say,
he paid no attention to literary composition, and
hated controversy; but his opinions _were ﬁrmly
established and his method of expression straight-
forward; so that his writings have a strong sweep.
He had no need to remember even the old maxim,
that ‘art is to conceal art; for he spoke and wrote
in the simplest and most natural way, and was sur-

prised to ﬁnd himself considered eloquent. His

ideas of the sacredness of conscience were almost
superstitious, and he thought the rights of the
pleader ended with the solicitation toward obedi-
ence to the dictates of one’s own sense of duty.
His literary papers show what his reputation would
have been had he conﬁned himself to polite letters.

His Works ﬁll six volumes, and are still found

worthy of study, for they retain a considerable
popularity in America and England, despite the
temporary character of most of the subjects of the

various lectures and essays. Channing died in
1842, at the age of sixty-two.

3. OTHER T HEOLOGICAL WRITERS.-—It will be
best to ﬁnish at this place the enumeration of the
other leading religious writers of the century. The
principal theological work that has appeared since
Edwards’s famous treatise is the Sysimzalzk T/zeo/ogy
of   Charles Hodge, professor in Princeton seminary.
Dr. Hodge was born in Philadelphia in 1797, grad-
uated at Princeton in 1815; and was connected with
the seminary from 1820 to 1878. He founded
a review in 1825, which is still published, and
which for half a century supported the Presby-
terian tenets of faith. A few commentaries, a
Presbyterian church history, and a religious manual
preceded the extensive work previously mentioned,
which appeared in 1871 and 1872. No abler e2!po-
sition of Calvinistic principles has been made since

‘Edwards, and Dr. Hodge covered more ground than

his predecessor. The whole treatise is carefully
elaborated, and represents the patient labor of a
life-time. James McCosh, who became president of
Princeton College in 1868, had won a reputation as
a philosopher and theologian before his departure
from Belfast, Ireland. But since he has made the
United States his home, mention should be made
of the principal works he has published in this
country. They are Tﬁe Laws of Dz'5cursz'7/e T/wag/11
(1869); C'/2rz'sz’z'czm'z’y mm’ Posz'z’z'7/z'.s‘m (1871), a reply

to the school of John Stuart Mill; and Tﬁe Smtlzfs/z
Pﬁilosop/zy (1874), a popular history, defence, and
exposition of the metaphysical school to which the
author belongs. Two other college presidents—-
Mark, Hopkins of Williams and Noah Porter of
Ya1e——have devoted much thought and ability to
mental science. Dr. Hopkins’s inﬂuence has been
personal, to a considerable extent, but his E7/z'z2’e;zce.s
of C/zrz'sz‘z'(z7zz'ty and Law of Love have put his argu
ments before the outside world. Dr. Porter is the
author of a larger work on T/ze ffzmzmz fnlellea‘, an
elaborate and thorough manual of philosophy, of.
which the author has prepared an abridgment.
Thomas C. Upham, professor in Bowdoin College,
wrote in I831 a work on the EZe'me7z2‘s of Meizlal
Pﬂilosop/zy, long the principal text-book on the sub-
ject in American schools. James Marsh, president
of the University of Vermont between 1826 and

‘I833, exerted considerable influence in popularizing

the transcendental philosophy of Coleridge in this
country, though his writings were fragmentary.
Laurens P. Hickok, long connected with Union
College, Schenectady, has expounded in several
works the doctrine of “the necessary distinctions
in the intellectual functions of the sense, the under~
standing, and the reason.”———the quotation is from
President Seelye of Amherst,--— and this doctrine
he chieﬂy elaborated in his volume, 7715 Logic of
Reason. His literary style is obscure. Francis

35 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Wayland, president of Brown University, Provi-
dence, from 1827 to 1855, wrote excellent text-
books of ethics, philosophy, and political economy
(from the free-trade standpoint). Tayler Lewis,
professor in Union College, was linguist, philoso-
pher, and scientist; and, though holding opinions
of the stoutest orthodoxy, foreshadowed in Sciezzce

the Methodists, and Ezra Abbot of the Unitarians
have been experts in biblical study. Few notable
works from Roman Catholic sources have appeared,
though Archbishops Martin J. Spalding and John
Hughes were forcible and somewhat voluminous
writers. A foundation for lectures on preaching at
the Yale Theological Seminary has given our litera-
ture an excellent little library of works on homi-
letics, in which volumes have appeared by Henry
Ward Beecher, John Hall, William M. Taylor, and
Phillips Brooks. Mr. Beecher has been, both in
the pulpit and the press, an active supporter of the

p more liberal Congregational ideas, and his miscella«

principal exponents of less stringent Views in the
historic New England theology have been Drs.

mainly regarded as a defence and illustration of
theology, and that American metaphysics have
been, in consequence, at once less brilliant and
less destructive than English or German. This

record now returns to the miscellaneous literature
of the country, which had made but a modest ﬁgure
before the second war with England.

4. THE KNICKERBOCKER SCHOOL.-——“The Knick-
erbocker writers” is a loose and not very useful
term applied to certain authors who began to write
soon after the beginning of the century, who were
for the most par.t residents of New York, and who
were "in some cases descendants of the old Dutch
stock. After the If/zz'r.éer/zocleer ./llagaziize was
established some of them became its contribut.or.s,.
and this fact caused the nickname to cling longer

than it otherwise would have done. For the sake

of convenience the members of the coterie may
be considered in order, including under this head
the names of Washington Irving_, James Kirke
Paulding, Joseph Rodman Drake, and Fitz-Greene

g Halleck.

5. WASHINGTON IRVING was a native of New
York city, born in 1783, and growing up in fa-
miliarity with its sights and characteristics. His
father was of an old Scotch family, and his mother
was an Englishwoman. They were married before
coming to this country. The boy’s older Qrothers
had rather marked literary tastes, and under
their guidance and example he soon began to read
such of the English authors as his father’s library
contained. At nineteen he wrote for a newspaper
edited by his brother Peter, taking up theatrical

and social topics, and using the name of Jonathan
Oldstyle. This pseudonym describes the nature
and tone of these youthful productions with suffi-
cient accuracy. In 1804, attacked by a slight
malady of the lungs, Irving sailed for Bordeaux,
whence, after various tours in the Mediterranean
and Italy, he went to Paris for a few months’
residence. Taking Belgium and Holland on the
way, he next settled for a time in London. He
met Washington Allston, the painter, in Rome, and
half made up his mind to abandon literature for
art. He returned to New York in 1806, with a

4 wide European experience and a great store of
literary material. At home again, he at once set I
himself to work, and the next year started a fort-

nightly periodical after the style of the English
essayists of the eighteenth century. Salmagzmdi
was the title, and it professed to give the “whim~
whams and opinions of Launcelot Langstaff, Es-
quire.” Like Addison, Irving had the help of other
literary friends in his enterprise, Paulding aiding
him in the prose and his brother William furnish-
ing the poetry. The social follies and fashions of
the day were satirized in a vein of genial humor,
and the work is therefore a good picture of ‘by-
gone customs. 'There is a story running through
the whole, and most of the characters mentioned
were real persons. Cockloft Hall, which ﬁgured
prominently in the periodical, was a ﬁne old house

(still standing, though so modernized v as to be
unrecognizable) on the bank of the Passaic River
in Newark. In December, 1809, K'7zz'céer[2océer’s
£z’z'52‘ory of [Wm York appeared. Washington
Irving and Peter Irving began it as a parody on
a popular handbook issued a short time before,
and its historical style was a burlesque of the lan-
guage of a sketch printed in that publication.
When Peter Irving went to Europe, Washington
determined to continue the historical burlesque,
and to make it a longer and independent comic
history. An air of verisimilitude was given it by
the publication of some preliminary notices con-

cerning the ﬁnding of the manuscript in the Co-

lumbian Hotel, in Mulberry Street; and not a few
persons were dull enough to be deceived by its
evident but very delicate pleasantry. Some de-
scendants of the Dutchmen took serious offence at

I the personal caricatures in the ’book, but everybody

read it, and it was not long before it became a
national classic. We had, at length, something all
our own, which was not copied from London or
borrowed from Paris; and the impetus thus given
to native production was very great. In 1810
Irving wrote a short biographical sketch of the
poet Campbell, and three years later edited a
magazine in Philadelphia, which for the next few
years showed some signs of becoming the literary
capital of the country. During another trip to

WASHINGTON IRVING. 41

Europe he began to publish the Séele/z Boole, in
numbers, and it was a success both in London and
New York. Irving had won the warm friendship

of Sir Walter Scott, who induced the London pub—_

lisher, Murray, to accept his book and pay the
round price of £200 for it. Murray afterwards
doubled this sum, and Irving soon found himself
in receipt of revenues from his pen much greater
than Charles Brockden Brown, his only American
predecessor as a professional author, ever enjoyed.
The Skele/z Book contained the Lege/zzl of Sleepy
Hollow and R2} Van I/I/'z'7z,éle,- and readers per-

ceived that a new master of prose style had arisen,

as well as a delicate humorist and a man in sym-
pathy with the human heart. In 1820 and 1821
Irving was in Paris, and in the latter year Mur-
ray paid him the enormous price of £1,000 for

, Brczeebrzklge Hall, a picture of English country life.

In 1824 £1,500 was paid by the same publisher
for the Tales of cz Traveller, a work of similar char-
acter, and containing stories of greater interest.

Strange to say, it met with sharp criticism both in I

England and the United States. Two years later
Alexander H. Everett, then minister to Spain, gave
Irving a commission to translate some recently col-
lected documents concerning Columbus. This was
the basis of Irving’s Lzfe and Voyages of C/zrz's2‘0j)/zer
Columbus, published in London in 1828, which was
sold for three thousand guineas. Irving was now

as successful both in fame and money as the best
English authors who wrote at that period of high
literary remuneration. This biographical work was
kindly received by the critics, and seems to have
determined Irving to cultivate the Spanish ﬁeld
further. The C/M0722’;/es of #26 Coagaesz‘ of Granada
followed, the author having made another tour in
the south of Spain. It was a losing venture, and
attracted no general praise; but Irving wrote still
another Spanish book on the Voyages of!/ze Campan-
iom qf C0/améas, which appeared in 1831. 2726
A//zaméra (1832) was a sort of Spanish edition of
Braceérzdgvre Ha//. After serving for a time as sec-
retary of legation in London, Irving returned home

in 1832, received a public dinner, and determined

to explore the wilds of the West, in lieu of Castilian
antiquity. His Tour 072 1/26 Praz'rz'es (1835) was
issued, with some European sketches, in a volume
entitled T/Z6’ Crayon ./I/zlvcel/any, which took its
name from the author’s pseudonym of Geoffrey
Crayon, Gentleman. Asforza, the obscurest of his
books, described Irving’s youthful visits to the
Montreal station of the Northwest Fur Company,
and embodied accounts of early fur-trading expe-
ditions in Oregon, by John Jacob Astor and others.
Miscellaneous contributions to the jﬁzzkéeréocéer
Magazzrze occupied the author until his appoint-
ment, in 1842, as minister to Spain. Coming
back in 1846, he enlarged a very agreeable biog

raphy of Oliver Goldsmith, in which he hit Dr.
Johnson some hard raps, and also went to work on
Ma/lame! aim’ /zis Successors, published in 1850.
About the same time he subjected the Whole of
his previous works to slight ‘revisions, and a new
and uniform edition was brought out. Undeterred
by advancing age (he was now 67), Irving set to
work upon his largest labor, the Lzfe of l’I/askzhglo/2,
the iﬁfth and last volume of which was published
three months before his death, in 1859. This Work
had an army of readers, and deserved them, for it
embodied all the accessible facts concerning Wash-

,ington’s life, in the felicitous style of one of the

greatest masters of English. The earlier works,
however, are most prized by the author’s public,
and the Ska‘:/z Book, on the whole, remains the best
example of his powers, combining, as it does,

, humor, pathos, and a wonderful felicity of descrip-

tion. Irving never married, but kept bachelor’s hall
in an attractive fashion at his cottage of “ Sunny-
side ” in Tarrytown.

6. JAMES KIRKE PAULDING was ﬁve years older
than Irving, having been born in 1778 in the town
of Nine Partners, in Dutchess County, New York.
He also survived Irving for a similarly brief period,
dying in Hyde Park, New York, in 1860. William
Irving was his brother-in-law, and Paulding took up
his abode in the house of that gentleman, in New
York, in 1797. Of course, having literary tastes of

44 A PR[MERi0F AMERICAN LITERATURE.

his own, he fell in heartily with the plans of his
every—day associates, and worked upon Salmagmzzlz
with enthusiasm, when that short-lived periodical
was started. Paulding was an ofﬁce-holder a good
part of his life, being secretary to the board of navy
commissioners in 1815, navy agent at New York for
a dozen years, and secretary of the navy during the
administration of Van Buren. He began his career
as‘ a poet; brought out, single—handed, in 1819, a
second series of Sa/mczgmm’z'; and during all his life
was constantly writing poems, novels, humorous
sketches, and pamphlets. Tﬂe Duz‘clzmcm’s Fz'resz'zz’e,
a novel published in 1831, is his best work; though,
like Irving, he wrote a considerable life of Washing-

_ton. Paulding’s mark on American literature was

not a permanent one, though sufﬁcient interest
remained in his writings to warrant the publication
of a revised edition of the best of them in 1867
and 1868.

7. JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE was a sort of Amer~
ican Keats in that he wrote little, died young, and
has kept a permanent place in the standard library.
At the time of his death (1820) he was only twenty-
ﬁve, having been a resident of New York all his
life. Poverty was his lot at the ﬁrst, but he con-
trived to study medicine, taking his degree in 1816.

Marrying a rich wife was his deliverance, and he s

was thus enabled to spend much of his time with
Fenimore Cooper and Fitz-Greene Halleck, mean~

F!TZ- GREENE HALLECK. 45

, while maturing plans for literary labor. T/ze Cul-

prz'z‘ Fay, his chief work, appeared in 1819, having
been written in consequence of a discussion between
Drake, Cooper, and Halleck concerning the poetry
of American rivers. In 1819, having been to Eu-
rope, he united with Halleck to contribute satirical
verses to the newspapers, under the name of
“ Croaker,” or “ Croaker, Jr.” 2726 Americcm Flag,
a national lyric of much spirit, keeps Drake’s name
in the school readers. He died of consumption in
1820, thus completing the parallel to Keats. It is
useless to speculate on the possibilities of his career
had he lived; but surely none of our poets, unless
it be Bryant, wrote so well while yet under age.

8. FITZ-GREENE HALLECK was almost exactly :1
contemporary of Irving and Paulding, having been
born at Guilford, Connecticut, in 1790, and dying
there in 1867. He removed to New York in 1811,

and became» clerk in a banking-house, but after-

wards went into the ofﬁce of John Jacob Astor.
Halleck, Charles Sprague, Hiram Rich, and Ed-
mund C. Stedman, of our poets, have resembled
the English Samuel Rogers in being connected
with blanking. Halleck wrote little poems when a
boy, some of which he contrived to get printed in
the newspapers. But when he formed his literary
partnership with Drake, though twenty-eight years
old, he had no great reputation. He wrote little
more than Drake, and his martial poem, Marco

Bozzaris (ﬁrst published in a volume in 1827) has
remained his virtual title to fame, though he wrote
a long poem called Emmy, and lesser pieces en-
titled Aime/z'aé Castle and Bzzrm, which have their
admirers. On Dral<e’s death he produced an ex-
cellent poem, four lines of which promptly passed
into the paradise of current quotation. With the
mention of his poem on Tze/z'Zz'g/zz‘, it is only neces
sary to add that Halleck retired to Guilford in 1849

on a pension of two hundred dollars a year, given

by the will of John Jacob Astor. Halleck edited an
excellent edition of Byron, as well as two volumes
of selections from the British poets.

9. OTHER EARLY PoETs.-— Richard Henry Dana
was born in 1787, and in early life, having studied
at Harvard, was associated with the club of gentle-
men. headed by William Tudor, which established
T/ze ./Var!/z Amerz'ccz7z R62/22320 in 1815. Strangely,
the venerable Mr. Dana did not receive his degree
of Bachelor of Arts until 1866, at the age of seVenty=
eight, having participated in the famous Harvard
rebellion of 1807. Like his New York contem-
poraries, he published an essay—serial called 271;’
[die Maze, on which Bryant and Washington Alls-
ton gave him some help. T/ée Bzzccarzeer, with
other excellent and carefully written poems, ap-
peared in 1827, and this piece remains his best
achievement. His prose essays are graceful and
his poetical style worthy of comparison with that of

the British poets of the elder day. Charles Sprague,
a Bostonian who never Went ten miles from his
home, was another writer who deserves mention for
the quality rather than the quantity of his verse.
His Ozle 072 S/zczkesjbeare is a remarkable and admi-
rable production. Richard Henry Wilde, a native
of Dublin and a member of Congress from Georgia,
wrote a good Lzfe of 721550, a long poem entitled
1ETe5perz'a, and a famous lyric beginning, My Lzfe is
lzléea Summer Rose. Other poets made celebrated
by single pieces were Francis Scott Key, whose
Star Spangled’ Banner was written during the siege
of Fort MeHenry, Baltimore, in the war of 1812;
Samuel Woodworth, who wrote T/ze Ola’ Oaleeiz
Bucket; John Howard Payne, whose Home, Sze/eel

‘ Home was ﬁrst made public in a play; Albert G.

Greene, the author of Oltl Grimes is Dead; and
William Augustus Muhlenberg, whose I ze/ozzlzl 7202'
live alway is one of the most famous of hymns.
Washington Allston, the artist, wrote some medi«
ocre poetry and a tolerably good novel. J. G. C.
Brainard and James A.'Hillhouse were the suc-
cessors of Trumbull in Connecticut. Hillhouse
was the author of somewhat heavy poems and
dramas on religious subjects, ffarlazl coming under
the latter head, and being his best-known produc«
tion. —

Mr. Dana, he continued his activity as an author
to the end of his life, in 1878. He was born in
Cummington, Massachusetts, in 1794, his father
being the village physician and a man of good
mental powers. i Of all examples of literary pre-
cocity Bryant is the most remarkable. At the age
of ten he was writing verse for the country papers,
and at fourteen he brought out a couple of political
poems, T/ze Embargo and Tﬁe Spamsﬂ [€62/oZza‘z'o7z.
They were received with such favor that it was
difficult to persuade the public that they were the

work of a boy of fourteen. A second edition ap-R

peared in 1809, with certiﬁcations to that effect.

4 In 1810 Bryant entered Williams College, but did

not graduate, receiving, like Dana, his bachelor’s
degree many years afterward. While in college
he_was famous as a writer and reader. Taking the

law for his profession, he printed in 1817 his

celebrated poem of T/zamz2‘opsz's. choosing as the
vehicle 7726 ./Von’/2 Amerzkazz R67/zlew, which was
begun as a bi-monthly and a general literary mag-

azine. The poem has since been greatly changed,

but even in its earliest form it plianly showed the
arrival of an American poet greater than any who

‘had preceded him. Though the poem has death

for its subject, it contains, like the Psalms of
David, no absolute expression concerning the con
scious immortality of the soul; yet it has been
universally accepted‘ by Christians as an embodi-

ment of right views of life and death; omitting,
perhaps, but not denying. In 1821 Bryant read
a long poem on Tim Ages, before the Phi Beta
Kappa Society at Harvard, and the same year
collected a few of his poems in a volume published
at Cambridge. In 1825 he removed to New York,
and became editor of the Umtea’ Slates R67/z'ew, for;
which he wrote largely. The next year he became;
editorially connected with the Ezzerzzkzg Post, then a
strong Federalist paper, but changed by Bryant
into an organ. of Democracy and free trade. A
little bound volume, called T/Z6 Talismarz, appeared
annually for three years, beginning in 1827, Robert
C. Sands and Gulian C. Verplanck doing some of
the writing, and Bryant the rest. It only differed
from Tke [rile Mara and Salmagumli in its wider
scope, less frequent issue, and possession of covers.
At this time Bryant wrote occasional short stories.
In 1832 he brought out a new edition of his poems,
which, thanks to the inﬂuence of Irving, was re-
issued in London. Kit North praised it in Black-
woozz’, and the poet’s position became secure, both
abroad and at home. Between 1834 and 1849
Bryant was thrice in Europe, and wrote of his
journeyings in a prose work called Leilersi of oz
Traveller. A second series of these letters followed
another journey in 18 58. By 1864 Mr. Bryant,
though a very SIOW and painstaking writer, had
accumulated enough additional poems to make a

thin volume. Of all his pieces, besides I/l6l7Z(b
topsis, those entitled To a Waterfowl, A Fares!
Iiymn, and T/ze }’Zam‘2'72g of z‘/ze Apple-Tree are the
best. Bryant is the poet of nature, whose various

moods are accurately depicted in his polished verse.‘

A certain coldness can fairly be charged against
him, but no underlying lack of human sympathy.
After passing his seventieth birthday, he deter--
mined to translate the Iliad of Homer. Although,
unlike certain other celebrated translators, he was
not compelled to learn the language, he prepared
himself thoroughly for the task, and published in

, 1869 a version which, notwithstanding the constant

agitation in England, for twenty years, of the ques—
.tion of Homeric translation, has been very gener-
ally accepted as a good English Homer. It is in
unrhymed heroic pentameter. A similar translation
of the Odyssey appeared in 1871. By a fortunate
circumstance, the short period since 1867 has seen
the_appearance in America of new versions of the
Iliad, Odyssey, Dir/z°7ze Comedy, .x£7zez'd, and Faust,
each of which has at once taken a creditable place
hmong translations in English. Of the last three
mention will be made under the names of their
respective translators.

and Emerson having been his seniors, and Whittier

1807. Longfellow was born in Portland, Maine, of
a courtly and well-to-do family. When fourteen
years old, he entered Bowdoin College, where he
graduated in 182 5 in the class with Nathaniel
Hawthorne. It is a circumstance without precedent
that the two persons who are by many considered
the ﬁrst poet and the ﬁrst prose writer of the coun-
try received their bachelor’s degree at the same
time and from the same hands. Other members of
this remarkable class were George B. Cheever, John
S. C. Abbott, and S. S. Prentiss. William Pitt
Fessenden, John P. Hale, and Franklin Pierce were
also in college at the time. Like Bryant, Longfellow
at ﬁrst determined to be a lawyer, but the year after
graduation, though but nineteen, he was offered the
professorship of modern languages at Bowdoin, to
qualify himself for which position he spent three
years of study in Europe. From 1829, after his
return, until 1835 he occupied the chair, writing
short poems, and printing prose articles in Ike ./Voriﬁ
Amerzicm Revzkw. His ﬁrst book was a little essay
on the moral and devotional poetry of Spain, includ-
ing translations of the Coplas de Zllazzrique and some
of Lope de Vega’s sonnets. In 1835 he was chosen
to succeed George Ticknor, who had just resigned
the chair of modern languages at Harvard, a posi-
tion in ﬁlling which the university authorities have
always shown remarkable wisdom. T1115 professor-
ship he continued to hold until 1854, when he re-

signed and was succeeded by James Russell Lowell.
With occasional trips to Europe, he continued to
reside in Cambridge until his death in 1882, occupy-
ing the stately old house used by Washington for
his headquarters in 177 5.

12. LoNGFELLow’s PoEMs.— Volees of tlze ]\/Zglzt,
his ﬁrst original volume, appeared in 1839, and in-
cluded the best of the author’s poems written up to
that date; among them, some produced in his un-
dergraduate _days at Bowdoin. He was luckier than
Tennyson in the reception given to his ﬁrst venture,
for A Psalm of Lzfe, T/ze Reaper and Me Flowers, and
Woods in I/Vz'm‘er were among the pieces included,

‘almost every one of which at once became a popular

favorite. Ballads aml Ofﬂer Poems—among them
‘T/ze Séelelzm 2'72 Armor, T/ze Rain y Day, and T/ze Vil-
lage Blae,ésmz'2‘/z—-appeared in 1842; and also a
slender collection of Poems 072 Slavery, generally

d considered the least meritorious of the poet’s works.

T ﬁe Spamk‘/1 Sladem‘ (1843), a capital drama, intro-
duced an element of humor which Mr. Longfellow,
with a single exception, did not afterwards cultivate.-
Tﬁe Belfry of Brages, mainly original poems, with a
few translations, came in 1846. The next year,
1847, Mr. Longfellow began the publication of sev-
eral poems which had a powerful effect in stimulat-
ing the growth of a literature devoted to American
subjects. E7/a72gelz'7ze was the ﬁrst, written in hex-
ameters, a metre previously little used. In its

Z0./VGFELLO W’S POEMS. 5 3

employment Mr. Longfellow has had plenty of fol-
lowers, but none have succeeded in its use save
Arthur H. Clough, an English poet who resided in
America for a time, and William D. Howells. The
latter writer, unlike Longfellow, introduces rhymes
into the metre. T /ze Seaside and Me Fz'resz'de (minor
poems) and Tea Golden Legend came between
E72czngeZz'ne and Ifzlzzexaz‘/zcz (18 5 5), another American
poem, this time on an Indian subject, and written
in a second unfamiliar metre, trochaic octosyllables.
In it were embodied many Indian legends industri-
ously collected by the author, and put into a form
that proved attractive to multitudes of Americans,
and wholly novel to the English public, which had
al-ready given to Longfellow greater favor than it
had ever shown to Tennyson. T/ze Courts/zigb of
Jlﬁles Standzklz (18 58) was a semi-humorous poem of

colonial days, also in hexameters. In Tales of a

Wcz_ysz'de Inn (1863), the expedient was adopted of
embodying, as tales told at a chance gathering in
an old inn at Sudbﬁry, several long poems on vari-
ous subjects. Two additional series have since
appeared. Mr. Longfellow’s distinctively American
poems closed with Tne _/vm England Tmgedies
(1868), two stern colonial dramas; and in 1871,
having published T/ze Dz'7n'ne T mgedy, a dramatic
account of the cruciﬁxion of Christ, the author
united. the two last-mentioned. works and Tne Golden
Legend in a single volume entitled Cnrzlﬁns. They

make a symmetrical whole, but ‘the idea of connect-
ing them was probably conceived after the issue of
the earliest part. T/ze ]{cmgz'7zg of tile Creme, a brief
domestic poem, made a sumptuous illustrated vol-
ume in 1874; and the next year the poet read at
the ﬁftieth anniversary of his graduation at Bowdoin
a remarkable poem, Morz'turi Salummus, which, un-
like most occasional pieces, was great and noble,
because of the author’s intense personal feeling in
the event. Flower de Luce, Aﬂerma-t/1, Ike Masque
of Pamlom, Kemmos, and Ultima T lzule Were later
books; [72 2723 Haréor and ./Ilia/zwl Angelo posthu-
mous. Throughout all Longfel1ow’s poetry the pre-
vailing marks are grace and beauty, warmed by a

greater human sympathy than is displayed in the

Writings of the majority of eminent poets.

13. LoNGFELLoW’s PROSE WoRKs.— Though they
are only three in all, the prose volumes of Mr. Long-
fellow deserve to rankwith the best of American
books. Daintiness is their prevailing characteristic.
Ozttre-Mar (1835) is a collection of sketches of
travel, with special attention to the romantic feat-
ures of continental life. I17}/perz'07z (1839) is a rounded
and interesting romance, with a quaintness which is
not artiﬁcial. It is a Wonderful example of the
beauty of the English language. [far/cmag/z (1849)
is a shorter tale, Written in a more popular, but
idyllic, style. It should be mentioned that an essay
on Anglo—SaXon literature, published more than

forty years ago, gave the ﬁrst considerable impulse
to the study of that language, in which American
scholars have since done more work than their
English contemporaries.

14. LoNGFELLow’s DANTE.-— All through his
poetry Mr. Longfellow shows the inﬂuence of his

familiar acquaintance with foreign literature, and,

almost all of his, collected volumes have containedi
a few translations. In the autumn of 1867, a
volume a month, appeared his translation of the
Dz'72z'72e Comedy of Dante, of which he had long been
a profound student. It closely follows the metre
of the original, line by line; and may be said
to have shortened the reign of the old-fashioned
loose school of translators, like Chapman, Dryden,
and Pope; The spirit as well as the form of the
original is preserved; and Mr. Longfellow, besides

giving a version of Dante which is incomparably

superior to its predecessors, has inﬂuenced, by his
work, quite a body of American literalists. This
ﬁdelity and sympathy is gained, however, at the
expense of tripping ease of language, and the trans-
lation must be considered rather hard reading, a
circumstance partly due to the frequent presence
of thefeminine ending of the verse.

15. JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER, although always
the most industrious and conscientious of authors,
never attained high popularity until recent years,
when, by common consent, he has been ranked with

the first of American poets. A poor boy, of Quaker
parentage, he began life as a farm hand and shoe«
maker, going to the village school in the winter
months. His ﬁrst poetical efforts, written when he
was but seventeen, were published in the N ewbury-
port Free Press, edited by William Lloyd Garrison,
and he subsequently contributed verses to the
1'-Iaverhill (Massachusetts) Gazeite, published near
hisbirthplace. He afterwards contrived to spend
two years at the academy in that town. In 1829 he
began to be connected with journalism in Boston,
where, as well as in Hartford, I-Iaverhill, Phila-

 delphia, and Washington, he edited newspapers

until 1839, and in 1847 he became corresponding
editor of Dr. Gamaliel Bai1ey’s ./Vcztiomzl Em, of
Washington, to which he contributed many poems,
reformatory and otherwise. He early identiﬁed

  himself with the movement for the abolition of

slavery, aiding in the establishment of the American
Antislavery Society at Philadelphia; and of this act
he has said that, though not insensible to literary
reputation, he set a higher value on his “name as

appended to the Antislavery Declaration of 1833 V

than on the title—page of any book.” Legeizds of]Vew
England (1831) was the title of his first collection
of poems, but after that and throughout the long
antislavery agitation, his poems were chiefly reform-
atory, and directed to awakening the people to the
horrors of slavery and the wickedness of any com

in the dreadful trafﬁc. His Voices of Freedom (1841)
and Tﬂe Panarama mm’ oz‘/zer Poems (18 56) contain
many poems which are full of ﬁre and inspiration,
and glow with moral indignation and scorn. They
were spirit-stirring as a trumpet-blast, and a power-
ful help towards the downfall of slavery. His
poems, In I/Var-Time (1863), gave him a popularity
wvhich his adherence to the hitherto despised cause
had rendered impossible, and with the close of the

war he gladly turned his pen to gentler themes, 4

publishing successively Snow-Bozma’ (1865), The

Maud Muller is the best known of his poems, and
Baréara Frzklc/zz'e (1862) the most remarkable of
those connected with the civil war. Snozé/-Bozma’ is
a genuine New England idyl, and puts between its
covers more of the spirit of the region than any
other American book. It will forever remain ‘a
national classic. Mr. Whittier has collected the

, chief of his prose writings in two volumes, and has

edited the best edition of John Woolman’s_]oumaZ.
As a writer of prose, he unites strength and grace
in an unusual degree. His biographical sketches
are valuable as contributions topolitical history,

and, in some cases, beautiful as the tribute of friend  

to friend.

58 A PRIMER OF AZIIERICAZV L] T ERA TI/‘RE.

16.HoLMEs’s PoEMs.— Oliver Wendell Holmes
was born in a historic house in Cambridge, just
opposite the Harvard University buildings, in 1809,
and grew up in that town before it had outgrown
its quainter local characteristics. At twenty he
graduated at Harvard, in a class whose virtues and
whose ornaments he has never ceased to celebrate
in anniversary poems. Like Bryant, Longfellow,
and Lowell, he started out as a lawyer, but soon
took up medicine, which he studied in Europe,
paying special attention to anatomy, which branch
he long taught at Harvard. T/ze CoZZegz'zz72, a col-
lege periodical, received many contributions from

him, and in 1836, the year he took his medical

degree, he brought out a collected edition of his
poems in Boston, including a rhymed essay on
Poelry, read by him at Cambridge that year. From
that time he has always been the favorite Amer-

L ican poet at literary anniversaries. His lyrical

facility is greater than that of any other of our
writers, and for neatness it is LOt too much to
say that he is the equal of Pope. That he is a
humorist has detracted from rather than added to
his reputation, for there is a popular idea that a
humorist cannot have deep feeling. In Holmes’s
case this is not true, for 2716 Last Leaf, perhaps his
best single poem, is a masterpiece of pathos. 0112
Ironszﬂes is a standard national lyric, and Holmes
wrote a good’ share of the few commendable poems

evoked by the civil war. Some of his best pieces—
T/ze Deacon’: Masterpzeee, Parson T are]! ’s Legacy,
and Hbmeszek 2'72 1’{ea7/e¢z—-have ﬁrst appeared in
his longer prose works, where they have ﬁtted into
their surroundings with exquisite appropriateness.
He has written no long poem.

17. HoLMEs’s PRosE WoRKs.-———- Dr. Holmes was a
leading spirit in the establishment of T/ze Az‘Zam‘z'e
Mental)», which became, with its ﬁrst number, the
Blaeéwooa’ of Boston, and has probably printed
more articles by eminent authors within the past
twenty years than any magazine in the language.

Its prompt success was principally due to Dr..
i Ho1mes’s Aaioerat of me Breakfast Taéle, a series

of articles, half story, half essay, which were a
novelty in American literature. Their satire is
severe and yet genial, and their wit is as polished
and supple as a Damascus blade. T /ze Professor al
2‘/ze Breaéfasz‘ T aéle, written in the same style, soon
followed; and in 1872 the author once more tried
the ‘dangerous experiment of endeavoring to repeat
a former triumph, in which attempt he was entirely
successful. Elsie Vemzer, a curious novel whose
burden was inherited tendencies, appeared in 1860,
and Tae G'aara’z'aa Angel, one of the best American
novels thus far produced, in 1867. The hero of
the latter work is a scholarly old bachelor who has
written an unsuccessful book, but who goes through

the world like a moving patch of sunshine. Dr. »

60 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Holmes prepared a biography of John Lothrop,

Motley in 1878, and in 1882 and 1883 issued revised
editions of his prose works.

18. JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, like Holmes, has
written both poetry and prose, but it will not be
necessary to consider them in separate sections.
He, too, was born in Cambridge, in 1819, in a spa
cious old house which is still his home. His father
wasthe minister of the West Congregational Church
in Boston. Lowell graduated at Harvard in 1838,
when he was class poet, and recited a "poem which
was memorable in the student literature of the time.
A law oﬂice in Boston was opened in 1840, but the

poet soon shut its doors and devoted himself en~

tirely to literature. A Year’: Lzfe (1841) included
his poems up to that date, some of which the
author has since revised, throwing away the rest.
Two years later he began the publication, in Boston,

of 772.6 Piorzeer, a periodical of so high a character

that it would surely fail now, and of course promptly
cameito its death at that time, though Lowell, Haw-
thorne, and Poe wrote for it. Robert Carter assisted
Lowell in editing the three numbers that appeared.
In 1844 Lowell gathered‘ poems enough to make
another volume; among them were A Legend of
Brz'z‘z‘a7zy and R/zcecus. Some of the sonnets were
pronounced in their antislavery sentiments, being
addressed to Wendell Phillips and‘ Joshua R.
Giddings. The remainder of the volume consisted

_/AZIIES RUSSELL LOWELL. 61

of pieces which indicated that a new and true poet
had arisen. The subjects were not novel, but they
were treated in a style which was a rare union of
strength and minuteness of phrase, the author’s
opulence of thought preventing his nicety from
seeming artiﬁcial. A prose series of Com/ersaz‘z'07zs
072 me Ola’ Poeziv (I845) critically considered Chaucer,
George Chapman, and some obscure writers. It
found few readers, and has never been reissued,
though its author’s maturer judgment has since pre-
pared critical articles on several of the authors in-
cluded, notably Chaucer. Another volume of poems
was printed in 1848, of which T/ze Present Crz'sz's
made a considerable sensation. T/ze I/z'sz'oI2 of Sir
Lazmfal, published the same year, is the most
elaborate of the author’s productions, being an
allegory of good deeds, and containing many quot-
able lines. At this time Mr. Lowell was very indus-
trious, for in 1848 he also brought out, in New
York, A Faélefor Crz'z‘z'es, a wonderfully clever char-
acterization, in ﬂuent verse, of the leading authors
of the day, himself included. This characteriza-
tion, though made in a humorous style, was accurate
and just, and in the case of the younger writers
mentioned its predictions have been -amply veriﬁed.
At the same time appeared the ﬁrst series of the
Biglow Papers, a collection of poems in Yankee
dialect, by “Hosea Biglow,” edited and furnished
with absurdly learned notes and introductions by

“Homer Wilbur, A.M., pastor of the First Church
in Jaalam.” These poems served a double purpose;
that of preserving the perishable local expressions
of New England in a permanent form, and of ﬁght-
ing with the sharpest weapons of satire against the
extension of slavery. This work, together with the
Eaélefor Crz'z‘z'cs, for the first time made Mr. Lowell
21 popular author, and gave him a reputation in
England, though English readers have more re-
cently discovered that he is something more than
a humorist. In 1855 Mr. Lowell succeeded Mr.
Longfellow in the chair of polite letters at Harvard,

‘taking a European trip before entering upon his

‘new duties. In 1867 a second series of the Bzglow
Papers included those poems in dialect which had
been called out by the war. They were preceded
by a critical essay in which was shown the antiquity
of many presumed Yankee peculiarities_ of expres

sion. Never a fertile writer, it was not until 1869

that sufﬁcient minor poems were collected by Mr.
Lowell to make another volume, which took its title
of Under 1/ze I/V2’!/oze/3 from its leading poem. The
Commemoration Ode, in honor of the Harvard men
who were killed in the war, was recited at Cam
bridge in 1865, and is the author’s noblest poem
and the chief literary result Qf the war. For con-
siderable periods Mr. Lowell was editor of T/za
A2‘/a7ztz'c _/110722‘/zly and T /16 ./Von‘/z A meriam Review;
and his critical and miscellaneous essays in those

OTHER POE TS. 63

periodicals have been collected into '~;‘:c:',r«m"«.es entitled
Among my B00/es (two series) and My Smziy W372-
dows. These books, which show their author to be
the leadincr American critic, are a very agreeabne
union of wit and wisdom, and are the result cf
extensive reading, illuminated by excellent critical
insight. The only objection ever made to them is
due to their somewhat colloquial style; but this has
been‘ generally regarded as one of their charms.
As literary guides and stimulants for young readers
they are unsurpassed.

19. EDGAR ALLAN PoE was an entirely original
ﬁgure in American literature. His temperament
was melancholy; he hated restraint of every kind;
and he was the slave of drink. These three cir~
cumstances made his life a wretched record of
poverty and’ suffering. But his Bells, Ra?/€72, and
Amzaéel Lee are wonderfully melodious; and he

was "a master in that assonance and alliteration

which have since been so marked a characteristic
of the schools of Swinburne in England and
Baudelaire in France. In prose Poe wrote able
but partisan literary criticisms, and weird tales
which are much inferior to those of Hawthorne.
He was born in 1809, and died in 1849.

20. OTHER PoETs.——- American literature has been
uncommonly fertile in poets who, though they have‘
not reached the ﬁrst rank, have written well and
proved their right to the name. James Gates Per-

54 A PRIMER OF AMERICAN LITERATURE.

cival, a melancholy and shy scholar, wrote A
Dream of a Day, and other pieces which have
retained popularity for their sentiment and smooth
versiﬁcation. N. P. Willis and George P. Morris,
long associated on a New York family journal, were
poets whose, reputation has not been a lasting one.
Willis wrote scriptural pieces of much power, and
his present neglect by the public is as unjust as its
previous ﬂattery was unwise. The artiﬁciality of
his poems has been their ruin. Morris Wrote spir-
ited and popular songs, which are still sung.
Edward Coate Pinkney, of Baltimore, was the
author of lyrics which Poe insisted would have

‘made him famous had he lived in New England.

Charles Fenno Hoffman, still living, but long in-
curably insane, was also a facile lyrist, and wrote
a novel and books of travel. George H. Calvert
has produced many dramas and poems, but his

I biographies of Goethe and Rubens are better worth

preservation. Dr. Thomas Dunn English became
famous by a single song, Em Bolt; he has since

, devoted himself more particularly to national poems.

George H. Boker, of Philadelphia, has zealously
tried to better the condition of the meagre ﬁeld
of American dramatic literature; and some of his
plays have strength and ﬁre. Charles T. Brooks
has made a good translation of the ﬁrst part of
Faust, and has rendered many of the most famous
German lyrics into English. C. P. Cranch’s trans-

OTHER POE TS.   65

Iation of the z£7zez'a’ of Virgil, in unrhymed penta-
meter, ranks with the other books in the recent
notable series of American translations. Mr.
Cranch has also put into original poetry a painter’s
color and art. The Divirze Comedy of Dante has
been partially translated by Dr. T. W. Parsons, of

. Boston, at the expense of his original verse, which

is of excellent quality. Alfred B. Street’s numerous
poems are mainly devoted to the celebration of
nature. W. W. Story, once a neighbor and friend
of Lowel1’s but latterly a resident of Rome, has
joined poetry and sculpture, just as Allston and
Cranch have united poetry and painting, and with

‘equal success. Notwithstanding the multiplicity of

religious denominations in this country, few good
hymns have been written during the present cen-
tury. As far as literature goes, our humor has been
better than our piety. The greatest development of

A American humor, in prose and verse, has been of

late years, but before the war John G. Saxe had
become famous for his clever travesties, puns, and
love poems. As a poet of pure merriment he is

‘unsurpassed. The ﬁrst of a numerous body of

social satires was William Allen Butler’s [Vat/zirzg
to Wear, published in 1857. Not until recently
have we had any female poets of the ﬁrst rank;
those Writing before the war, save the Cary sisters,
having been almost without exception slaves, led by
Mrs.‘ Sigourney, of the sentimentality which‘Mrs.~

21. ORAToRs.— During the present century, cer-
tainly in its ﬁrst half, oratory has equalled its
splendid beginning a hundred years ago. Unques-
tionably, the speeches of Daniel Webster, John
C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, Edward Everett, Rufus
Choate, William H. Seward, Charles Sumner,
Robert C. Winthrop, William Lloyd Garrison, and
VVendell Phillips belong to literature. ‘Fortunately,
the principal orations and addresses of all of them
have been well edited and issued in suitable form
for preservation and study, being in many cases
revised by the authors themselves.

22. H1sToRIANs.—At ﬁrst sight the number of
notable American historians seems small; but a
comparison with other nations shows that during
the present century we have had more than our

‘share of historical writers of the ﬁrst rank. Where

libraries have not been accessible, our industrious
O I: 0

investigators have created them; and their zeal
and accuracy have made foreign countries their

debtors, conspicuously in the case of Prescott,

Motley, and Parkman. .

23. RICHARD HILDRETH was born in Deerﬁeld,
Massachusetts, in 1807, and died in Florence, Italy
in 1865. He graduated at Harvard in 1826, stud-
ied law, and then entered journalism. Like Motley,
Hildreth began his literary career by writing a

GEORGE BA./VCROFT. 67

feeble novel, called Arc/zy Moore (1837), directed
against slavery, whose evils the author, like Chan-
ning, had beheld while on a tour for his health.
Afterwards he wrote, in books and in the news-
papers, in favor of free banking and against Texan
annexation. Another forgotten work of his was a
campaign life of Harrison; and Hildreth also took
a lively share in the theological controversies at
that time still smouldering in Boston. A T/160732 of
Moral: and A T/zeory of Po/2'2’z'cs were written while
the author was editing a paper in British Guiana.
A longer list of obscure works written by a famous
author need not be asked for; but Hildreth stepped
to the front rank in his ffzlviory of Me Um'z‘ezZ States,
which he had been planning to write all his life,

and for which plenty of material had been accumu‘ Q

lated. It begins with the discovery of America,
and ends with the ﬁrst presidenta term of James

rMonroe. Its style is rather dry.

24. GEORGE BANCROFT, the author of the other
chief history of the United States, was also born
in Massachusetts and graduated at Harvard. His

studies were completed at Gottingen, then the fash-

ionable German university for American students,
and on his return he published a volume of poems
and a translation of a Work on ancient Greece. An
attempt to found an American Eton at Northamp-
ton, Massachusetts, in which Brancroft took part,
was soon abandoned. The ﬁrst volume of his

Ifzkiory of flu I/’m'2‘m’ Slales, the standard work
on the subject, both for its matter and manner,
appeared in 1834. Since that time he has toiled

diligently and pretty constantly upon it, though .

the twelfth volume did not appear until 1882,’ the
author having meanwhile been secretary of the navy
and minister to England and Prussia. The style of
the work is brilliant, and the author excels in
descriptive passages. His frank comments on the
characters mentioned have brought down upon him
a shower of pamphlets written by descendants or
partisans of the officers criticised. The work
begins with Columbus and ends in 1789. A re-

vised edition is now (1883) in course of publication.

25. JOHN GORHAM PALFREY, another Massachu-
setts man and Harvard graduate, who for the first
ﬁfty years of his life was a student of biblical liter-
ature and a polit ian, in both of which characters

i he ‘was successful, began in 1858 a Zﬁsiory of /Vezcr

Englcmzz’, which, with no great charm of language,
holds’ a high rank for completeness and accuracy.
No other part of the country has found so full a
Four volumes had been issued previous
to the author’s death in 1881. Z

26. WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT, the most
brilliant and famous of American historians, was a
descendant of William Prescott, who fought at
Biﬁaﬁker Hill. While at Harvard, in 1812, his left

eye was so injured that during the rest of his life‘

_/OH./V LOTHROP M0 TLEY. 69

Prescott was partly blind, and had to employ an
amanuensis and a mechanical contrivance for writ-
ing. Luckily, his means were ample and he was

able to pursue his studies, in the midst of a remark»

able literary coterie, until he was thirty years old,
when he determined to write his Iﬂstory of Ferzz’z'-
rzcma’ and Isabella. The composition of the work
occupied him eleven years, and the author expended
much money in the accumulation of material. It
was immediately translated into ﬁve European lan-
guages, and became the most celebrated work of
history written on this side of the Atlantic. Pres-

4cott’s Conquesz‘ of Zlfexico (1843), Coizguesz‘ of Peru

(1847), and P/22'/2} 2726 Second (1855-1858), were
not less successful. He also edited Robertson’s
C/zarles V., and collected from the reviews "a volume
of Mz'scel/a72z'es. Three more volumes of P/zz'/zp 2‘/ze
Second were planned. Prescott died in Boston in
1859, and his life was written by his friend George
Ticknor. Not since Milton has so high a reputa-
tion‘ been won by a man practically blind; and no

5 historian in the language has written in a more

graceful and eloquent style.

27. JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY was born in 1814,
studied at Harvard and Gottingen, wrote two slight
novels, and in 1856 published 7726 Rise of file Dutc/z
Repuélzk, which has attracted readers and translators
only fewer than Prescott’s. Less ornate than Pres-
cott, Motley is not less readable, and as a political

./\/'6!/zer/cz7zrz’s was published between 1861 and 1868,
and the Zlgfe of_/M72 of Bameve/a’ in 1874. Motley,
like Irving, Bancroft, Lowell, Marsh, Boker, and
Howells, represented the United States abroad.
He died in 1877.

28. OTHER HIsToR1ANs.—Jared Sparks, president
of Harvard between 1849 and 1852, wrote many
biographies and theological works, and brought out
between 1834 and 1837, in twelve massive volumes,
Washington’s writings, together with a life. In
1840 he ﬁnished a similar edition of Franklin, in

ten volumes. Both works are indispensable, as is

His style is singularly graceful, and he is the most

ident Lincoln’s remark that he had derived from
them all his knowledge of history. The larger
works of John S. C. Abbott are injured by their
partisan tone, though they are very readable. Geo.
W. Greene’s [{z'52‘orz'caZ View of Me Americazz Revolu-
tion is the best condensed record of the time, and
excels in its analysis of causes of events. His life
of his grandfather, General Nathanael Greene, was
called out in response to Bancroft’s strictures.
Parke Godwin published in 1860. the ﬁrst volume of

29. TRAVELLERS.-— As next of kin to historians,
mention should be made of a few travellers, though

I in this department we have less to boast of: Elisha
_Kent Kane, Charles F. Hall, and Isaac I. Hayes in

the Arctic region; John Ross Browne, Thomas W.
Knox, and Commodore Charles Wilkes in voyages
around the world; E. G. Squier and J. L. Stephens
in Central America; Eugene Schuyler in Turkistan;
and Henry M. Stanley in Central Africa. Benson
J. Lossing’s Fz'elzz’—book of the Re72olzzz‘z'o7z is both travel
and history.

30. FICTION. ——]AMEs FENIMORE COOPER. —
Charles Brockden Brown began the long line of
American novels, but James Fenimore Cooper was
the ﬁrst writer of fiction to be extensively read.
Born in Burlington, New Jersey, in 1789, he spent
his boyhood at Cooperstown, Otsego County, New

York, a village founded by his father in 1786.

72 A PRIMER OF A/VIERICAZV LITERATURE.

Having studied three years at Yale, he entered the
navy as midshipman in 1805, remaining in the
service six years, and acquiring that knowledge of
the sea which he afterwards put to such good use
in his books. Premzmoiz, his ﬁrst novel, was pub-
lished anonymously in 1821. It met with no great
success, being a tame story of the English type,
though subsequently Cooper's readers gave it a
higher place in their esteem. T/ze Spy (I82 1) found
a multitude of admirers, and was republished in
Europe in many translations. This story, as well
as 2726 Piorzeery, issued the next year, was thor-
oughly national, and Cooper thenceforward occu—

pied as his own the ﬁeld of wild life in the West. '

His novels were full of romantic interest, and
showed the public that American scenery and life
furnished as good a foundation for ﬁction as the
castles of Europe. T/ze Law‘ of 2‘/ze ./l/oﬁimizs (1826)
is one of the best of the remarkable group of stories
called the Leatherstocking Tales. Cooper was
American through and through. He did not hesi-
tate in some of his later stories to satirize the
“louder ” national characteristics-, but to him more
than any other author is due the increasing atten-
tion to home subjects and heroes. From his writ-
ings, undoubtedly, a part of the English public got
the impression, which it has with diﬂiculty cor-
rected, that buffaloes and Indians form the most
conspicuous features in our civilization. Half of

Cooper’s better works were devoted to the sea, the
most successful being T/ze P2702‘ (1823) and T/ze Rea’
Rover (1827). Cooper’s quarrels with his country-
men were numerous, chieﬂy because he thought
them lukewarm in national pride; and he increased
the hostility of the newspaper press by a multitude
of libel suits, in many of which he was successful.
T/ze Paz‘/zﬁmier and T/ze Deerslayer appeared in
184o’and 1841 ; and Aﬂoat am! Amara three years
later. An elaborate Naval flisiory of tile U72z'2‘ea’
States and a series of biographies of naval ofﬁcers
were among the other writings of this industrious
author, who by no means conﬁned himself to a
single ﬁeld. His last book was T/ze Ways of 1/26’
flour, an attack on the system of trial by jury, in
the form of a story, somewhat in the style later
adopted by Charles Reade. Cooper’s novels have
won high praise from the ﬁrst critical authorities,

including Bryant and Prescott, but his later books,
, with no diminution of merit, found fe_wer readers

than their predecessors. Cooper virtually had the
ﬁeld to himself, at ﬁrst, and the novelty of his
subjects aroused in his writings an interest which
their intrinsic literary merits hardly warranted. In
later years a host of imitators have written more
exaggerated Indian stories, which long formed the
principal literary diet of the lower classes, though
their popularity is now somewhat waning.

31. NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, whom James Rus-

sell Lowell has called the greatest imaginative
writer since Shakespeare, was born in Salem in
1804, of anvold colonial family, some of whose
members, as a matter of conviction, had taken part
in the persecutions which made the early history of
that town so famous. In later years the Haw-
thornes (who spelled their name Hathorne) had
followed the sea, and Nathaniel’s father, a ship-
master, died at Surinam in 1808. From his mothei
the boy inherited a serious disposition, that lady
having so grieved over her husband’s loss that for
thirty years she insisted on isolating herself in he
room. Nathaniel was a feeble child, but was able
to enter Bowdoin College at seventeen, where, as

_ has been seen, Longfellow was his classmate. His

intimate friend, however, was Franklin Pierce, a
member of the class next above him. On gradua-
tion he returned to Salem, and outdid his mother
in absolute seclusion, writing all day, and stalking
over the ancient town at night. Fcms/zczwe, an
anonymous romance, was published in Boston in
1828, but was never acknowledgediby the author.
For years it was a great literary curiosity, but has
lately been reprinted._ It is a somewhat crude pro-

duction, but full of the power which afterwards '
,made the author famous. In 1836 Hawthorne

became the editor of the Americcm Mcgvazzhe of
Useful Know/edge, published in Boston; of which,
though nominally editor, Hawthorne was, in fact,

the sole author. He had destroyed many of his

_ earlier pieces, but by 1837 he was able to collect

enough stories to form the T wire Told Tales. Long-
fellow and other critics saw and said what they
were, but the general public failed to appreciate
them. The first edition contained only half the
present work, and a revision, with a second series,
appeared in 1842, and found a few more readers.
Bancroft, who was then collector of the port of
Boston, gave Hawthorne a place in the custom-
house in that city, which he lost on the accession of
Harrison in 1841. A short sojourn at the famous

Brook Farm in West Roxbury followed; and every-

where the shy, mysterious romancer was the shrewd-
e-st and minutest of observers. In 1843 he took up
his abode in the old Ripley house at Concord, close_
by the bridge where the “embattled farmers stood.”

  Hawthorne’s residence in old houses was partly

from accident and partly from choice; but of all
his homes this was most to his liking, and in the
volumes called Mossesfrom cm Ola’ Ma7zse (1846) he
has celebrated it in the choicest language. This
collection of stories and sketches was in the same
general style as the Twice Told Tales. Emerson
had been a former occupant of the house, and Haw-
thorne’s Concord neighbors were Emerson, Thoreau,
and the younger Ellery Channing. In 1846 Haw-
thorne became surveyor at the Salem custom-house,
and, as usual, made his residence there an oppor-

tunity for the industrious collection of literary
material. The advent of the Whigs into power, for
the second time, once more displaced him, and he
retired to a little cottage in Lenox, Massachusetts,
having published in 1850 I726 Std?’/62‘ lelter, a very
powerful and dramatic colonial romance, written in
faultless English. At Lenox Hawthorne was un-
usually industrious, writing in 1851 I723 [fame of 2‘/ze
S67/ezz Gab/es, embodying his Salem sight-seeings,—-—
a story still more intense and solemn than any of
its predecessors. Tﬂe B/ii/zea’ale Romance (1 8 5 2) was
founded on his Brook Farm experiences, and com~
bined the loftiest humor with the deepest pathos.
Zenobia, the heroine, is probably the greatest of

_Hawthorne’s creations. The same year, 1852, Haw-

thorne Wrote a third series of T wire Told Tales, and
a campaign life of Pierce, for whom, ever since his
college days, he had maintained a strong friendship.
Hawthorne’s ﬁrm adherence to Democratic opinions
was singular, for he was the last man in the country
whom one would have suspected of any political
interest whatever. Thoreau was not more unworldly,
and yet Hawthorne constantly endeavored to help
his party in every way. There was no suspicion of
time-serving, and when, in 1853, the romancer was
given the Liverpool consulate, both parties rejoiced.
For the first time in his life Hawthorne was in easy
circumstances, though a thriftier man would have
made more money out of his lucrative position.

OTHER N0 VELISTS. 77

Resigning in 1857, he spent three years in England,
France, and Italy. His Eizglis/z and Imliam Note-
Books, published posthumously, are full of these
experiences of one of the best of sight-seers. The
Amerzeam 1V'o2‘e—Boo/es consist of his home diaries,
and contain hints for a hundred books, which none
but Hawthorne ever could write. Our Ola’ Home,
sights and scenes in England, was published in
1863,*during the author’s life-time. T/ze Maréle
Fazm appeared in 186o,— an Italian romance, by
some considered his best work. Hawthorne had
brought out three juvenile books between 1851 and
18 5 3,— being stories of history and mythology; and
after his death were found the fragments called
T /ze Aizeeslral Feotslep, Doeior Grim:/zawe’s Seerez‘,
Seﬂz'mz'us ﬁelloiz, and T /ze Dolliver Romcmee,—— all of
which, in order, were studies for the same never-
ﬁnished book. So ends the list of the works of the
foremost American writer.

32. OTHER NovELIsTs.—-John Neal, one of the
most long-lived and voluminous of our writers, was
the author of several American tales. Another
historical novelist was William Ware, a Unitarian
clergyman, whose Aureliare, }‘uZz'cm, and Zezzobiez,
illustrated life in ancient Rome. Sylvester Judd,
also a Unitarian minister, wrote ‘in 1845 Margaret.-

been considered the greatest of our works of ﬁction,

CHAPTER I.
1620-1775.

1. THE BEGINNING.--AS soon as the English

colonists landed on American shores, at James?

town and Plymouth, they began to think of the
establishment of schools of sound learning: in Vir-
ginia for the purpose of educating the Indians, and

in Massachusetts Bay for the supply of church

pastors. By 1619 the ‘proposed Virginia university
possessed, as gifts from English -donors, ﬁfteen
thousand acres of land and ﬁfteen hundred pounds
in money, and its early establishment at Henrico,
on the James River, was prevented only by a gen~
eral Indian massacre on March 22, 1622, when
three hundred and forty persons, including the su-
perintendent of the university, lost their lives.
Nothing further was done toward establishing a
Virginia college until 166o, and the College of

ous as to make it almost unreadable. This work
was illustrated by Darley in a remarkable series of
outline designs. William Gilmore Simms, one of
the leading Southern writers of the century, was
born in 1806 and died in 1870. He wrote many
poems, but is chiefly remembered by his novels,
among which are 2726 Yemassee, T/ze I’arz‘z'scz72, and
Beam/zampe. John Esten Cooke, of Virginia, has
written less, but his novels of Southern life are
equally meritorious. The best of them is 2%.? Vir-
gz'/zzrz C0mea’z'a7zs, an admirable picture of the courtly
Virginian of the elder day. Charles F. Briggs, a
native of Nantucket and all his life a journalist in

‘New York, wrote contemporary novels pleasantly

combining satire and humor; Harry Emma in 1839,
and T/ze Ifazmfea’ ./llerc/mm‘ in 1843. Richard B.
Kimball has also illustrated in ﬁction the every-day
life of New York city. Dr. William Starbuck Mayo,

~ in [V67/er Agczirz, has likewise held the mirror up

to modern American society. John P. Kennedy,
secretary of the navy under Fillmore, wrote good
nqyels of old-time society, in his Swallow Barn and

tween ﬁve and six hundred thousand copies in this
countryalone, and having been forty times trans-
lated. Her later novels, though superior from a
literary point of view, have naturally appealed to
a more limited interest. T/ze .Mz'm'sler’s Waning and
T/ze Pearl of Orr’: Island are faithful New England
pictures, and Oldlown Folks, one of her later books,
introduces her best creation, Sam ' Lawson. Next
to Uncle‘ Tom, as a literary success, came T/ze I/Vz'a’e,
I/Vzde World of the sisters Susan and Anna Warner,-
published in 1850. Other popular female novelists
have been Catherine M. Sedgwick, the author of
Hope Leslie; Miriam Coles Harris, who wrote Ru!-
lezz’ge,- and Maria S. Cummins, whose Z.ampo'z;g/tier
was one of our most successful novels. "Grace

sGre‘enwood” (Sara J. Lippincott) and "Fanny

Fern” (Mrs. James Parton) have written sketches
and stories of interest, though mostly ephemeral in
value. p

33. EMERSON AND THE CONCORD AUI‘HORS.--
Ralph Waldo Emerson is the most distinguished of
American essayists, and his inﬂuence on thought
and style has been marked for forty years, making
Concord our literary Mecca. The descendant of
eight generations of clergymen, Emerson was born
in Boston in 1803, and graduated at Harvard in
1821. Between 1829 and 1832 he was a Unitarian
minister, but left the pulpit in consequence of his
radical opinions. Having made a short trip to

So A PRIMER 01? AMERICAN LITERA Tl/RE.

Europe, he began his career as a lecturer, in which .

capacity he became more famous than any other
American author. A slender book on Nature made
a great stir among thoughtful people in 1839. In
1838 he had delivered, his celebrated address before
the divinity school at Cambridge, and his personal
inﬂuence became very great in forming the “ Trans-
cendental” movement, an attempt to abandon tra-
ditional forrns and society’s chains and to get back
to nature’s freedom of thought and rectitude of
action. T/ze Dial was the organ of the school in
1840, and Margaret Fuller, Emerson, Alcott,
Thoreau, and the younger Channing wrote for it.
Emerson’s two series of Essays appeared in 1841
and 1844.; 1€epreseI22‘az‘z'7/e M672, a course of lectures,

‘in 1850; Eizg/is/z Trazfs in 1856; 7726 Co7m’zza‘0f

Life in .1860; Soczkty arm’ Salziuzle in 1870; and
Letlers and Social Aims in 1876; in which year a
carefully revised edition of his poems was also
published. These poems are full of high thought,
often expressed with rare beauty. Both in poetry
and in prose his inﬂuence is as spontaneous as
that of nature; he announces, and lets others
plead. Henry D. Thoreau was a recluse who once
lived on the shores of Walden Pond, in Concord,
providing for his simple wants by surveying and
gardening. Waldeiz is his best book; but in seven

other volumes he carries the reader straight to’

Nature’s heart. Amos Bronson Alcott, at ﬁrst an

educator, has been the sole mpresentative in this
country of the art of imparting knowledge by “ con-
versations,” which he has held for many years in
various parts of the United States, though residing
in Concord. Of latter years he has collected some
of his writings into books, and wrote a volume of
sonnets in his eighty-second year. William Ellery
Channing, a nephew of the famous divine, has
written a biography of Thoreau and four volumes
of poems. The best poetry, save Emerson’s, writ-
ten during the period of Transcendental inﬂuence
in America was that of Jones Very, of Salem—in
personal life a recluse, but in spiritual stature
among the very first of our poets. Emerson com-
pared his sonnets with the utterances of the Hebrew
prophets, and declared them inferior only “because
they are indebted to the Hebrew muse for their tone
and genius.” Very felt himself to be in constant

"communion with the Divine spirit, whose messages

he strove to read from the books of nature and the
soul.’ He chieﬂy wrote in the sonnet form, and
many of his lines are deep in thought and strong
in expression. Hawthorne——by far the sagest
American critic, when he spoke——called Very “a
poet whose voice is scarcely heard among us by
reason of its depth;” but at another time, with
that clear sense which governed his every word,
stated his belief that Very’s limitations arose from
his “ want of a sense of the ludicrous.”

34. MISCELLANEOUS WRITERS.—- George William
Curtis, whose style entitles him to be called the
American Charles Lamb, has written a great num-
ber of essays in periodicals; two graceful books of
Eastern travel; T/ze Potip/zar Papers, the best social
satire produced in this country; and Tramps, a read-
able novel. George Ticknor, professor of modern
languages at Harvard between 1817 and 183 5, pro-
duced in 1849 an elaborate Ifislory of Spamsk Liz'-
eratzere, twice since revised, and accepted here and
abroad as the standard. Edwin P. Whipple is the
most faithful of American critics, and in his several
volumes has given a thorough review of many of the

best English and American books,—— his researches

in Elizabethan literature being his chief work.
George S. Hillard wrote in 1853 a good account
of travel in Italy; and another book of Italian
thought and experience, somewhat more artistic,

Twas published by Charles Eliot Norton in 1859.

The Two Years before 2‘/ze Mast of Richard H.
Dana, ]r., a record of personal experience, is the
American classic of travel. In books of local
observation and experience, the White Mountains
have been well described by Thomas Starr King;
and the peculiar life of Cape Cod in the stories of
Charles N ordhoff. The Leliers from _/Vew York of
Mrs. Lydia Maria Child made a sensation in their
day. Mrs. Child’s Progress of Relzgzous Ideas (18 5 5)
and Aspirations of Z‘/ze World (1878) are valuable con-

tributions to the study of the science of religion.
Her Appeal in ﬁe/zalf of Matt Class of Amerzkam
called’ Africans (1832) is noteworthy as the ﬁrst
contribution of a woman to the antislavery litera-
ture /of the country. It was an admirable little
work, and helped to carry Wendell Phillips into
the antislavery movement. Margaret Fuller, an
ardent Transcendentalist, and editor of T/ze Dial,
left no permanent literary memorial in book form,
but in editorial and critical writing strongly affected
the liberal thought of her time. Henry Reed wrote
literary and historical criticisms. Samuel G. Good~
rich put history and natural history into popular
forms, and wrote in readable fashion on all sorts of
subjects. H. W. Herbert ﬁrst digniﬁed ﬁeld sports

S‘ by making them the subject of well-written books.

Donald G. Mitchell wrote Dreamlzfe and T/ze
Re7xerz'es Q)‘ a Bat/zelor, which have never lost
a strong hold on popularity; and he has also
treated farm subjects pleasantly, and is the author
of Dr. _]o/ms, a successful novel. Dr. Edward
Robinson, in his Biblzkal Researc/565, published
between 1841 and 1856, produced a work which is
considered a standard in all coun*ries. He was the
father of biblical archaeology in America. Several
standard editions of Shakespeare have been edited
in this country, chief among them being those of
Richard Grant White and Horace Howard Furness.
Delia Bacon and Nathanie. Holmes have supported
