84'alry into the world of the unknown, but in our
Journeyings abroad, we should have regard to
method. Especially should it be so, in our
journeying abroad into the world of words
which are found in our school books and in
other books. as well as in the wilderness of
objects, whose names and qualities the young
are always so anxious to learn.
After a few somewhat desultory lessons
have been given on the black board, the teacher should proceed to arrange the words of his
pupils' spelling lessons, according to order and
method. It is true that in beginning with
the words slate, hand, &amp;c., as already -mentioned, we observe one species of order or
method; but there is a plan to be described
which is much more orderly aind methodical,
as well as more natural.
One of the first lessons which should be
presented, under the new systemn of which I
am  speaking, should be the naimes of things
in the school room. These should, at first and
to some e:tent, be dictated, slowly, by the
teacher; and at the same time slowly wv-itten85
on the-black board and corrected in the usual
manner.
From the objects immediately around the
pupils and known to them, we may make the
following selection.  These are, for the most
part, implements of the school room.
slate      table       wall ~      hand.
pencil     pen         window     head
stove      ink         glass       body
fire       inkstand    book        stove pipe
wood       desk        rule        ashes
This lesson would include the name of a
part only of the objects near the pupil; reserving for a second lesson a few others whose
orthography is a little more difficult. Here
are a few of this second class.
board      knife       key        clock
black board  crayon    dictionary  ceiling
door       port crayon tongs       shoe
floor      copy book   shovel      boot
thermometer spelling book cloak    hat
One of the earlier lessons of words for spellI
ing, however, may be the names of the various
parts of the human frame.    Mr, Bumstead in
his took entitled " My First School Book,"
makes a lesson of this sort the very first.--
Here follows a part of this class or family;
4486
such as seem   to me most obviously proper
not indeed for a first lesson, but for a third or
Jourl-th.
head       ear         temple       toe
neck       cheek       hair         foot
sthoulder  teeth       back         ankle
elbow      mouLh       breast       skin
arm        lip         side         hip
hand       chin        body         loins
thumb      face        leg          chest
finger     nose        heel         wrist
A subsequent lesson might be formed from
the more difficult of this family, or class, as
follows:
eye        tongue       knee-pan    heart
eye-brow    tlhroat     tendon      artery
eyv-lid    palate       nail        vein
eve-lash   wirnd pipe   blood       nerve
fore-bead  stomach      flesh       marrow
skull      knee         bone        muscle
Now, I do not mean to say, that it is best
to give so long a lesson, at once, as either of
the above at least in all cases; though neither
of them is so far extended as to include the
whole family to which it belongs. My object
has been,chiefly to show what [ mean by classifying or grouping words together.
We may now     proceed to other classes ortamilies of words; such, for example, as the
-names of the more common objects or implements.of the kitchen, the garden, or the farm..
Perhaps the names of the more common flowers of the garden would make a li-st sufficiently
long for one lesson; reserving those of the
fields, forests, and hedges, for -a subsequent
one.
IHere are the names of some -of the more
common flowers of our gardens:
rose       -tulip     lady shoe   morningglory
pink       poppy      lilach      hollyhock
peony      marigold   violet      sun flower
heart's ease daffodil
The names of field and forest flowers might
naturally come in next.. The following are
somie of them:
dandelion  ivy        lily        may-weed
buttercup  laurel     daisy       johnswort
honey suckle woodbine  clover     barberry
white wood  maple     -strawberry'apple'tree
magnolia   cowslip     thistle    peach tree, &amp;e
The names of fruits might properly enough
come next.   Here, also, I would make a di
vision of the foreign and domestic.  The fol
lowing are some of the first:'appTe     mulberry   strawberry  p1u,i
pear       blackberry raspberry  quince
peach      dewberry   whortleberry grape
apricot    musknmelon  bilberry  currant
nectarine  watermel-on gooseberry  cherry
The names of foreign fruits, such as are in
common use among us, might follow.        In
this list, however, we-might perhaps include
nuts:
orange     persimmon  chesnut    pine apple
lemon      raisin     almond      peanut
citron     prune      Brazil nut  coeeoanut
fig        date       lime
-walnut    banana
The names of the birds most common in
the vicinity of the school house, always makes
an interesting lesson; and if by birds is meant
the feathered race in general, a division might
be necessary, into domestic birds and fowls,
and those which have not been domesticated
-either of which would form quite a respectable list.  After these might follow the names
of quadrupeds, fishes, insects, &amp;c. Indeed
men themselves might be classed, in at least,
one respect-that is according to their nation
-as Englishmen, Italian, American, Chinese,
Hindoo, &amp;c.One additional suggestion to the: teacher
will naturally come in here. It is that in
forming these lessons he will always find it
useful to the pupils-exceedingly so-to call
on them for aid. Thus suppose he is writing
dowvn:on the black board the names of:our domestic fruits. I-Ie has written the words apple, pear, peach, and a few others; and now,
whether he can recollect any more or not, let
him call upon the class to recollect for him.
6 Ihave written such. and such words,'" he
says, reading aloud what he has written; "now
who can think of another?"  If he sees.: the
hands of a number of individuals up, he selects
from them whom he pleases; and these give
him. the information required,
Suppose the lesson designed: were a list of
the names of persons-say of men only.- Not
indeed of all the men's names.:; which could be
thought of, for that would make; a listI altogether too long; but, for the first, a list of
the scripture names of this;sort. Let the pupils here, too, be called upon to lend their aid6
Such a course would interest their: minds; and
as: it is. easy.to see, might be quite useful,So also in making out a list of quadrupeds,
we might furnish our pupils with pleasant
employment in recalling and giving us names.
The meaning of tile word quadrupedj as distinguished from biped, might and should be
given, as we pass along; as well as the meaning of many other new and often perplexing
terms.
But we should not only teach our pupils to
spell, correctly, the names of things, but also
of qualities and properties. I refer here to the
various colors, tastes, oders, &amp;c., of the objects
around us; as red, white, black, sour, sweet,
bitter, heavy, light, ugly, beautiful, offensive,
fragrant, &amp;c.
Again, too, we may collect the names of actions, as well as things and qualities.  Some
may be surprised at the phrase-names oJ cac
tions. But what are verbs but names of actions; as walk, write, break, speak, lift, ride,
&amp;c.? But, on this part of my subject at least,
a word to the wise will, most surely, be sufficient.
But once more; the names of occupations
and professions might form natural and inter4 91
esting lessons for slate and black board spell.
ing. The in!formation, moreover, which would
naturally come in, during the study of these
lessons, is too important to be slighted. Take
for example, a list of humran occupations, such
as are most common among us; and with
which it is to be presumed every pupil will be
more or less familiarly acquainted.   Here is
such a list.
farmer     tanner      turner      printer
gardener   tailor      butcher     engraver
joiner     physician   cooper      shoe-nmaker
carpenter  mitnister   blacksmith  weaver
miller     lawyer      hatter      spinner
baker      teacher     painter     housekeeper
In order to fix the attention of the intelligent schoolmnaster, for a moment, on the importance of this method of classifying words,
let me present, in contrast with the above,
the following lesson,-part of a lesson rather,
--from   one of our old fashioned spelling
books.
baker      dial        fever       giant
brier      diet        final       gravy
cider      duty        flagrant    gruel
crazy      dyer        focus       holy
crier      draper      fuel        human
cruel      fatal       glory       icy92. w
Let the teacher, I:say, observe.fr himself
and see if there is any natural bond of relationship between these words, or between any
two of them, as they now stand. What connection is there, for example, between baker
and brier?  Or between cider and crazy?  Or
between giant and gravy?
It is not in one spelling book alone that this
natural order of things has been overlooked;
it is in all, or almost all, This increases the
necessity-already sufficiently imperious-of
something more rational; and especially of
introducing to our schools slate and bl bck board
exercises.
It is not indeed to be denied-no one at)
tempts to deny it; it is cheerfully conceded
--that the slate and black board instruction
which: is here recommended, would cost a
teacher a good deal of labor; but what then?
HIave we not found that every thing valuable
on earth costs us labor?  But is not the kind
of instruction to which I refer exceedingly
desirable?
Had we a manual-a printed one I mean
-from which the teacher might make his93
selections, at least a part of them, without
being compelled to go through a dictionary
and make the assortment for himself, it would
greatly diminish, in no small degree, his labors. Such a manual would certainly be useful, although by no means indispensable; it
would be useful I mean:to teachers.
A difficulty may arise here, in the mind of
the reader. HIad we such a -manual, he will
say, the pupils could obtain it, as well as the
teacher; and whenever their lesson was taken
from it they might be disposed to avail themselves, privately, of its use.
But it should be remembered that even to
do this would be better than down right idleness, or roguery. Besides, no teacher would
be oblidged to take any whole list or!table
from it. nHe might make his selections, even
from that. He would, at least, add greatly
to the labor of any pupil who without attempting to think, should simply square his slate
by the manual. Or at any rate the teacher
could take away the manuals, or forbid their
use, just as he is accustomed to use his power
in other cases. No pupil thinks of looking94
into his book to see how the word is spelled
which the master pronounces, even though he
has it in his hand or under his arm. Or if
any pupil were inclined to do this, no good
teacher would allow it.
A stronger objection to slate and black board
spelling, in the manner I have recommended,
may be brought by some; and will appear,
at first view, to have weight. Only two or
three, it will be said, of the great grammatical classes of words-the noun, the verb, and
perhaps the adjective-can be spelled in this
way; and those only in their simple or primitive form. What is to be done with the pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and
interjections; to say nothing of a great many
verbs, adjectives, and nouns, which cannot
easily be thus associated or classified? And
what is to become of a host of derivative and
compound words?
As to compound words, there is usually,
little difficulty, if a child can but spell the
simple words of which they are made up.And in regard to derivatives, those should undoubtedly be taught by classes or families.95
I had reserved the teaching of primitives and
derivatives for a filth metho: of teaching spelling on the black board. It is however, in
reality, little more than a modification of the
fourth, of which I am now treating.    Let us
then consider it a few moments.
The teacher gives out, for example, on the
black board, the two words able and press, and
requires his pupils to collect, on their slates,
as many of their derivatives as they can.Each then writes down on his slate, as many
as he can recollect, either with or without a
dictionary, according to the direction of the
teacher.   When they have done, the teacher
-adds, in some way, those which they have
omitted.
Here follow  the derivatives of the word
able; or at least the principal of them.
able       enable     disability  payable
ably       enabling   probablv    rateable
abler      enabled'   probability tamteable
ableness   disable    commendable saleable
ability    disabling  curable     taxable
unable     disabled    notable    perishable
A much longer list will be made-and a96
much more important one-fromthe primitive
word priess. The following will, I believe,
include nearly all.

In regard to the other classes of words alluded to, why should not the teacher give
out to his pupils the prepositions, the conjunctions, the interjections, the pronouns, and
even the adverbs as so many separate lessons?
They are by no means numerous. Some of
them, as the conjunctions, prepositions, and
interjections, are not too long for a single lesson; while others, as the:adverb, and propress

noun might be divided.* It: might be remarked, however, that if these last were never
taught to the pupils of our common schools,
they would be about as well off as they now
are.  In what spelling book do we find any
thing like a complete list of all these words?
And where is the teacher whose ingenuity
ever supplies them? I could mention several
of each of these classes, and many of the ad
verbs, that I never saw in the columns of a
spelling book, in my life. Yet they are, almost without exception, highly important
words, and of frequent occurrence and use.
With respect to verbs and adjectives, there
is more difficulty; though, as I trust, I have
shown very conclusively elsewhere, the orthography of a considerable number of the
more common of both of them may be taught
on the black board with nearly the same ease
as the common and proper substantivestWith a little ingenuity, a teacher may group

DEFINING.
There are numerous ways of teaching the
definition of words by means of slates and
black boards. Some of these have been involved, of necessity, in the foregoing chapter;
and were it not for pursuing, as much as possible, only one thing at a time, I should be
inclined to recommend teaching spelling and
defining simultaneously.  Indeed in some
cases and with very large classes of pupils, I
have no doubt it may be well to do so; but,
as a general rule, it appears to me desirable
to keep them separate; at least for a time.
The methods of defining which are here recommended, will, however, in some respects,
be a review of the spelling lesson, just as that
was a review of the writing lessons.100
The first method of defining which will be
mentioned, consists in giving the pupils, on
the black board, a list of skeleton sentences,
which, after copying or transferring to their
slates, they are required to fill up.  These
should, at first, be very simple and easy, like
the following.
It is now           o'clock.*
Our slates are made to     on.
Our pencils are to         with.
The sun gives         and heat.

room101'When people are        they call a phy,
sician.
Horses and oxen are used to    wagons
and carts.
Birds      in the air.
Carpenters       houses.
Bricks are made of
This should not be regarded as precisely
the same sort of lesson with one which is
found in the chapter on spelling. There the
teacher dictates words to fill the vacant-spaces,
here the pupils are expected and required to
invent them for themselves. That was, indeed, an introduction to this, but was by no
means, the same thing. In truth most of the
preceding chapters are introductory to the
present, just as the present is to those which
follow it.
This method of teaching pupils to define
words, without the aid, to the teacher, of a
manual, will, I say once more, Cost him much
patient and persevering effort. And even
with the aid of;a manual, a good deal of judgment will be required in selecting the appropriate sentences and adapting them to the men=
51s02'al capacity and progress of the pupils.. or
customs vary so mauch in different places that
even the foregoing simple lesson, if found in aprinted manual, would require, here and there,
slightmodifications.. In someparts of our country, for example, oxen are seldom,.ifever used.
for draught, but only horses; or at most horses
and mules. In others, the same person is
both joiner and carpenter; but is in general,
called a joiner. And so of many other things
or customs alluded to, or- involved in the se--
lections.
And as for escaping from  hard labor, no
teacher should expect it, In the present state
of society, especially of schools, with every
thing to do, and few tools or instruments to
work with, and little sympathy from those
around him, a teacher should, on entering a
school, make up his mind "s to spend and be
spent" in an employment where he will re,
ceive veryilittle either of sympathy or co-operation. Let him not expect even the friendship, or the gratitude of those. for whom he
labors. But to resume the subject.
After the pupils have been sufficielntly1o0
drilled with lessons which require but little
thought, inquiry or study, let them have such
as are a little more difficult, yet by no means
beyond their comprehension; of which the
following may serve as an example.
Gold is of a     color.
The sea has a      appearance.
There are        primary colors,

Always       the truth.
Think       before you speak once,
Quadrupeds are those animals which have

land are usually called

Do you like to         on the slate'?
It is very,       weather.
Am I my          keeper?
If the blind lead the    both shall fall
into the ditch.
Let this first method of defining be pursued long enough to lead the pupils to think
for themselves. Deprive them, for the timne,
of all dictionaries, and if it were possible, of
all means of communicatioh with each other.
I have elsewhere insisted, at sufficient lengtl
and with sufficient earnestness, on the importance of separate desks for each pupil, at a
considerable distance from each other. Yet
in spite of this necessary provision, some will
still need much watching, or they will avail
themselves of the aid of their neighbors. Yet
there is hardly any thing of more importance
than to endeavor, at every possible step, to
throw them on their own resources.
When all have filled their blanks, and had
sufficient time for reflection, the teacher should
either examine their slates, separately, or require an assistant to do it. If all are correct,
why very well; if not, let him fill out theblanks on the black board, and require them
to make the necessary corrections.
It may not be advisable always to require
of every pupil that the word he inserts should
correspond precisely with our own intention.
Thus in the phrase respecting carpenters, it
is enough if the pupil inserts the word make
or erect, although build may have been the
word in our own mind.    What is not absolutely incorrect, or wrong, in such a case,
should be considered as correct; at least sufficiently so for the teacher's purpose.
The second method of defining, which, in
the natural order of things ought to be pursued,
is that of incorporating or framing words into
sentences. Thus tht teacher may give out a
list of words like the: following.
pen     book     moon      carpenter   hat
ink     fire     stars     boy         cap
pencil  sun      sky'      brick       dog
floor            steam    rock         cat
paper   gold  ~ smoke     eye          hen
slate   silver   stove    ear          duck
hand    water    horses   finger       fish.
head    ice      bird     shoes        oyster
This list is, of course, vastly too long for
the first lesson of the kind; but is given at
such a length, that the teacher may have aioN
clear view, in little space, of the plan which
is proposed.
The repetition of words which may be found
in the lessons on the preceding pages, is not
a matter of accident, but was intended.  It
will be soon enough to give out a set of words
with which they are less acquainted when
they have become masters as it were, of tlhose
to which they have already been introduced.
Let the teacher make all possible reasonable
haste; but let him remember, well, to I"Make
haste slowly."
This method of incorporating words into
sentences is very simple, and when once understood9 easily adoptedby the most ignorant
or indifferent pupil; while it also gives scope
to the more active minds and powers of the
more intelligent and ingenious. It consists
in merely taking the words of the lesson, one
by one, and so prefixing. or annexing other
words to them,. that the wvhole will make
sense. Thus suppose the papii has placed,
near the top of his slate, the word pen, as
below,
peni07
Now by prefixing to it the word my, and
annexing the two words needs, and mending,
the' sentence will of eourse read thus,
My pen needs nmending.
In this way pen becoimes incorporated, as it
is called, into a sentence.. And so of any
other word of the above lesson, and of tlhe
words of any other lesson which inay be presented.
Now is it not obvious, at a glance, that no
pupil, unaided, can thus fix, frame or incorporate words into sentences without becoming.master of their meaning?  How can he?He may fail of success, in his efforts, it is
true; but if he succeeds in performing the work;assigned him, he certainly understands at least
one common meaning of the words he uses.
In pursuing this course of instruction, I
have sometimes found pupils, who, not satisfied with mierely incorporating the given word
once, would relate quite a long story on the
slate, and perhaps introduce it several times.
All this repetition and effort is useful.  Such
voluntary efforts are a thousand times better108
for them than if the same thing were extorted
from them in the form of task work.
This part of my subject might be extended,
almost indefinitely, by examples of lessons,
like the foregoing; but if I have succeeded
in making the principle understood by the
reader, is not one example as good as a hundred?
We come now to a third method of teaching
-if, indeed, it should not be regarded as a
mere extension of the preceding. It is to
introduce into defining the classification which
was mentioned under the fourth method of
teaching spelling. Thus in giving out lessons
on the black board, to be incorporated into
sentences, (after a little progress has been
made in the second method above,) we should
take pains to arrange the words in natural
classes or families. A lesson like the following would be useful, including the names of
some of the more common birds.
sparrow     Jay      lark       humming bird,
robin       blue bird thrush  lirnnet
wren        black bird snipe    torntit
swallow     crow,    heron      mourning dove
martin      hawk     partridge  whippoorwill
Ruail.:ow. pigeon  woodcock  canary bird109
Here a little more thinking will be required than in connection with somnie of the
preceding lessons, while it will be equally interesting, and  till more instructive.  The
same will be true of many other classes of'
words, even though they were small classes.
The implements or instruments used in performing our various occupations would be useful.  Take the occupation of printer; of which
perhaps the teacher knows very little. iHe
knows, at least, that in order to print a book
on paper, there; must be
building        type           press
room            cormposition   pressman
forms            paper         proof
boxes           inik           proof reader,&amp;c.
As most children are unacquainted with the
art of printing, few might be able to incorporate a very long list of words which relate to
this occupation into sentences; I have therefore made it extremely short.
Of the names of the implements of husbandry, most children could make a good use of a
long list.  Thus suppose the lesson were the
following.
9  110
plougli    harrow       shovel     axe
oxen       roller       rake       sickle
horse       hoe        scythe      grindstone
yoke       spade       pitchfork   saw
hat ness   chain       cart        hay knife
fan         riddle     flail       basket, &amp;e.
These, with a little instruction, most pupils would readily dispose of.  Nearly as well
would they manage the names of the tools of
the carpenter, as
bench       axe       chisel       square
vise        broadaxe  mallet       hammer
plumb line  saw       dividers     gimlet
Need I say that besides cultivating the
thinking powers, and especially the faculty
of association, we are all this while greatly
enlarging the child's vocabulary, and making
him acquainted with the things and objects
around him?
Suppose a pupil, in copying the word dividers, should say, " Sir, I do not know what
a carpenter's dividers are."    You will #of
course inform him. In doing so, let your
language and explanations be plain and simple. The rest will listen. Are you not, by
the information you give him, enlarging his
mind? This you will be better able to deIII
termine, when you come to exalmine his list
of words. You will find there, if nothing more,
at least the echo of your own instructions.No great matter, however, if it is so; your
words have become knowledge to him. The
evidence of this will appear in the correct
construction of the sentence; and the earnest
desire, on his part, that if not correct you will
make it so.
A fourth exercise in defining, and the concluding one which will be mentioned-one
which naturally brings the pupil upon the very
confines of composition-is that of making out
lists of regular definitions, something like the
definitions of a dictionary, and arranged in a
similar manner, and either giving them to the
teacher for correction or correcting them from
a dictionary. Thus suppose the lesson to
consist of the names of the more common human occupations, they are required to define
them in the, simplest manner which may be in
their power. Let the lesson, for this purpose,
be the following.
hatter        attorney       collier
tanner        architect      cabinet-maker]12
printer        joiner         catrver
spinner        carpenter      gilder
potter         mi ler         house-keeper
farmer         druggist       elock-maker
gardener       carrier        wvatch-maker
minister       clotlhier      shoe-maker
merchant       paver
physician.     dyer
Care should always be taken by the teach,
er to have the words so written, on their slates,
as may be most convenient to them with respect to the additions they are to make, in the
form of definitions.  The words of the lesson
above should be writtten pretty near the left
hand side of the slate..Now with this lesson before him, or a part
of it, or one like it, the pupil is first to define
the word hatter.  Well, he says to himself, a
hatter is a person who maikes hats.  So he annexes to the word hatter, one who makes hats.
Then he proceeds to the second word.    Here
he is at a loss, perhaps, for a definition, i. e.,
at a loss which to choose between two -
whether to say I" tanner, one who maks leather," or "tanner, one who tans skins."   Iere
is room for much thought, and perhaps, in the
end, for remarks from the teacher, afs instruc113
tive as they will be welcome. So of the next
words, printer, spinner, &amp;c.
From words of this description tlhe transition would not be great to words of various
sorts. more difficult of definition. Sometimes
a verse or paragraph from a reading book
might be used for this purpose, and sometimes
an anecdote. The anecdote or verse might
be written on the black board; or the pupils
might copy and add definitions to such words
only as they could; omitting the rest.
In short, to repeat what has been already
repeated, nothing would be more foreign from
the intention of these exercises, than an exact
or servile imitation of them, in all circumstances. I have spoken of various methods of
teaching from the slate and black board. I
have expressed, freely and in sincerity, the
conclusions to which experience, observation
and reflection have led me. Yet it is by no
means improbable that many a teacher might
be greatly benefitted by what I have said and
shall hereafter say, who would not adopt one
in ten of the particular methods or exercises,
which are presented.   He would be led114
rather, (and this is what is most desirable,) to
originate plans and methods for himself.Every teacher of spirit, in pursuing another's
methods, will be apt to feel like David in
Saul's armor; awkward and embarrassedLet a teacher gird himself in his own armor,
and act for himself according to the circumstances in which he is placed, and the means
and materials which he has in his power.--
Others may affora hints; but others cannot
think for him-cannot even, with advantage,
originate for him, at least to any great extent.C H3 APTER VIII.
COMPOSITION.
Few things in the whole compass of an
English education are more dreaded by students, especially of our common schools, than
composition; and perhaps there are few tlings,
which, after all, are so imperfectly understood.
Now what can there be in the nature of composition itself which renders it so irksome to
the student, and is the cause of its being so
often but imperfectly understood?
They who have used the slate and black
board in their schools, according to the spirit
of the preceding chapter, will not long hesitate
for a reply to this question. They know that,
there is no inherent difficulty about the matter, at all: but that children who have ideas,
can be taught to put them down with pen {-Sr116
pencil or both; and that to do this is to com.
pose.
We have seen that the several successive
pro~esses of study on the slate and black board
involve, continually, those which precede
them; and have all the mnerit of reviews.Thus while teachling spelling, the pupil is, as
it were, constantly reviewing his writing, and
becoming more and more perfect in that
branch.:' In defining he is not only reviewing
his writing, but his spelling likewise.
And now, in teaching composition, in the
way proposed, the pupil will not only be attaining, ere he is aware, the art of expressing
his thoughts, but he will also at tile sanme
time be perfecting himself in the branches
which have already been attended to,viz. writing, spelling, and defining. Does any one
suspect this to be, in any respect, an exaggerated statement? Let him attend, then, to
the facts, methods, and illustrations which
follow; and I trust he will soon be freed fronm
his suspicions.
Nor let him be startled when I assure him
that if a teacher has followed the spirit of the117
plans and methods thus far presented, not
merely in a single lesson or two of each sort,
but to an extent which has rendered his pupils tolerably perfect in each, they are already
pretty far advanced in the art of composition.
They may not have heard the word composition from the mouth of the teacher; but they
are nevertheless able to compose.
The exercises in defining, which have beern
recommended, are especially of this sort.Every lesson which requires the incorporation
of words into sentences, is a lesson in compo;
sition; and a most excellent lesson, too.There are no special lessons in composition,
other thaln these, absolutely necessary. Observe however that I say absolutely necessary.
There are others which are highly usetul, no
doubt.
But, I repeat it, that if no special lessons in
coinposition were ever given to a child, no one
who should follow out the course of slate and
black board exercises which are indicated in
the foregoing chapters could fail, in the end,
to be able to express his thoughts, on every
subject, with his pen or pencil-yes, and withi18
his tongue, too-far better than without thlelm.
For it is not only true, as has beeni well said
by Blair, that " they who are learning to compose and arrange their sentences with accuracy and order are learning at the same time
to think with accuracy aind order;" but also
that both tllinking and composing with accuracy and order tend, in their results, to teach
the pupils to speak with accuracy and order.
Framing words into sentences then, is the
best elementary exercise in composition.But as the pupil becomes more and more fa
miliar with the progress of incorporating them
so as to make sense, the teacher can introduce,
gradually, several other things necessary to
produce the best style of English composition.
He can teach himn how to express himself
properly, clearly, precisely, Jorcibly, elegantly,
qc.
After the process of, framing words into
sentences-one word into each-has become
common, the teacher should, occasionally throw
together, on the black board, a greater variety
of words thain has yet been suggested, and
require the scholars to make their selec*11.9
tion, and incorporate into sentences such as
they please.  Perhaps he will find it convenient to assign to each of them a given number, say twelve or twenty. Or, in other in-.
stances, one scholar may select more, and
another fewer of the words; according to capacity; one twelve, another eight, another
fifteen, another twenty, &amp;c.
The reasons ibr this necessity are that so
great is the difference in children's minds that
where a lesson of a certain number of words
is given out to all, some will find it difficult,
without hurrying, to get through as soon as
others, or as soon as the time required, and
their thoughts will not have free scope; whereas if while the rapid pupil is required to incorporate twenty words into sentences, the
one of slower mould has only twelve or ten
or eight assigned him, he will be likely to do
better justice to his own powers of thinking
than he otherwise would.
Indeed, more than even this is true.When a large lesson of words-say forty or
filty-is placed on the black board to give
scope to the differing tastes of different pupils,120
one pupil will select a certain set of them,
another, perhaps, quite a different set. And
we all know how much more cheerfully and
successfully the mind will work when it is
pleased, than when it is otherwise.
Let the following be regarded as a mere
specimen of the exercise to which I now
refer.
steam-boat    thrush          tree
high-way       field          blue bird
store-keeper  walk            door
school room    peach          book
school master  brown          robin
fire-place     red            pencil
apple         swallow         bench
farm-house    ocean           island
It is not without design that a number of
compound words-a greater proportion than
I have used in any former example--have
been inserted in this list.  Children are interested in their use, and should be introduced
to them somewhere; and they are more or
less used in every species of good composition.
As one method of teaching not only spelling
and defining, but also composition, a teacher
may give out a story or a description of some,121
thing; from which his pupils may be required
to exercise both their memories and their
judgments in relating and writing down as
many of the words and sentenices as they can.
If a teacher fears he has not the necessary'"knack" or ",tact" for telling stories, he may
read a story from a book or newspaper; or
what perhaps is, in some cases, better still, from
the Bible. I might give a hundred examples
of this sort; but one or two will be sufficient.
The teacher may, for example, give out,
briefly, the story of Paul's shipwreck, on the
island of Malta; or as it was then called Meh
lita. He may mention the former and present
condition of the island; how Paul came to be
near there; where he was going; whom he
had with him for company; how many persons, &amp;c.; and having told his story, leave it'
to his pupils to recollect, gather up, and put
down such words and sentences as they can.
Some will recollect but very few, such as " A
viper fastened on Paul's hand;"' or "Paul was
going to Rome when he was shipwrecked."
Others may, perhaps, remember the whole
story.122
Or he may describe to them the view from
the top of Boston State House-the city with
its tall spires; the harbor, with its vessels;
the adjoining towns and villages; Bunker
Hill -and its monument; the islands and shores
in and around the harbor, &amp;c., &amp;o.
In either case, some pupils will remember,
but few words, while others will remember
imany. In the last instance some one, perhaps,
recollecting at the word Bunker Hill, an ani
ecdote he had heard from his father, or some
other aged friend, about the battle there, forgets the rest of the words in the description;
or at least many of them, Others will renmember and set down in their list
city          coast           war
spires        Roxbury         British
lhouses       Dorchelster     monum ent
churclhes     Chelsea         Bunker Hill
harbor        Brighton        Charlestown
vessel        Cambridge       State Prison
islanld       Maiden          Navy Yard
shore          Warren         steainboat
The mere recollection and putting down of'these words, I know, would be more a spelling and thinking lesson tlhan any thing else.
But let the pupils prefix or add something toeach word.   Let them, in fact, after making
out their list, interweave their words into
sentences, in all possible forms.   No matter
whether they relate anecdotes, or record passages of history which are lodged in their
memories, or merely write simple sentences,
descriptive or grave.  All will be serviceable;
all will contribute to aid them in the expression of their thoughts; all will swell the size
of their vocabularies, and develope and enlarge
their minds:
Another method-if indeed it can be called
another-is suggested by Mr. Bumstead, in
his " Spelling and Thinking combined,"' and
it is called by him "cSentence making, or Culb
ture of thought."   He says what has already
been in substance repeated in this work, "that
children like to fit tangible things one to
another; and it pleases them to find that they
fit well.  So in regard to words; with a little
skill on the part of the teacher, this will be
found easy and pleasant, even to very -young
scholars."
*This might with great propriety, have come in elsewhere, unper the gen -
era] head Defininlg.  However, it is not only an excellent lesson in defining,
dut so valuable also as a stepping stone in the art of composing, that I have
dleterniined on the whole to insert it in this place,I: ',II I|lIU'Il_

124
As an assistant to Sentence making, as he
calls it, he has prepated a table in the begin~
ning of his work.  This table consists of a set
of parts of sentences, such as "I am,"       I  
was," "He is a "-   The        child," &amp;c.; so
arranged that the youngest pupil may see
that some one or more words is wanting to
make sense.   There is one set of these parts
of sentences for every page or nearly every
page of the book; and it is made the dutyof
the pupil to select words from these pages,
and fit thern into the parts of sentences.
Perhaps I cannot present a better exercise
for slate and black board composition, than
one of these pages of words, with the corresponding parts of sentences, and Mr. B.'s own
explanations.
The following is page 9tho
eye            stare           talked
eves           starer          speak
see            stares          speakeP
seeinlg        staring        speaks
seen           stared         speaking
saw            peep           spoken
sight          peeper          tell
sights         peeping        teller
look           peeped'        tells

gazer         talks           whisper
gazed         talking         whispering
whispered
Now the part of his sentence table which
applies to this, is as follows:
The
I can
I am
I'have
He is a.His directions to teachers and others, in
explanation of this plan for sentence making
or composing are these.
"I Taking the ninth page, the teacher says,
"' Let us see what word on this will do to have
The put before it." It may'not be difficult
for'the scholars to judge and see where they
can do it, and to read thus-The eye, The sight,
The mouth, The tongue, &amp;c.  What words will
do to. have I can put before therm?   They
may discover that it will fit many, thus: I
can see, 1 can look, I can peep, &amp;c.
"The foregoing may be extended, thus  
6126
The eye of John.  The eye oJ a needle.  Tlhe
eyes of our old grey dat. The eyes of sister
Jane are very sore. Open the mouth wide. The
mouth of the pitcher is broken. I could not
speak withouzt my tongue.  We had a tongue for
dinner. I can peep through that hole.
Again, on another page, he has among others, the words singing, whistling, crying, sobbing, shrieking, bawling, &amp;c.; while for one
of the sentences, into which these words are
to be incorporated he has The     child.By inserting the words above in the blanks of
this sentence we have, of course, The sobbing
child, The singzng child, The crying child, The
bawling child, Scc.
Now the book to whic-h I refer is an exceedingly interesting little book; and if. a
spelling book of any sort were to be selected
for a child of mine, I know not at present of
a better one than this, in the English language. But every school which has an abundance of slates and black boards, and an ingenious'teacher who loves t ie school, can
have the sanme sort of exercises, every day,
without any printed books.   The teacher,127
in such circumstances, can invent his own
lesson.
This exercise, however, as a stepping stone
to composition -if indeed it ought not to be
called an exercise in composition itself, which
is the undoubted fact-has one advantage
over any thing which I have yet mentioned,
viz: that having a list of words written down
on the black board, a small set of defective or
blank sentences will be sufficient for the work
of incorporation for a lonYg time.  Thus, suppose the teacher should write on the black
board the following list of the names of trees.
hickory ~      white-wood     alder
oak:          pine            boxwood
maple         hemlock         fir
chesnut       sassafras       locust
elm            ebony          magnolia
ash            beach          dog-wood
bass          cypress         apple-tree
cherry        poplar          sumach
mahogany      birch           button wood
logwood
And then suppose, also, that he should prepare the following blank or partial sentences,
and ask his pupils to frame as many of the
words of the lesson, as they possibly could,
into those sentenceso128
The              is beautifulo
The              is very useful.
Boards are made from the...
Shingles are made from -
We make rails, for fences of the
treeo
The     - --- tree has fruit on it.
Would not such a table and set of sentences
afford much pleasant and -valuable employ~:ment to pupils of every age?  What though
they did not know the uses of many kinds of
these trees?  Would it not lead them to inquire?
But the teacher might take words which
are still more common, such as the followingo
hat,sing     bread     dog      think
basket  house    apples    horse   read
talk    bird     city      i un     hope
write   leaf     coat      speak    fear
Then for a part of a sentence he might take
the following.:I do not
I can not,He can
The.-.--- is large.129
I can          fast.
It is good
How much interesting and" intelligible employment such a small lesson would furnish!
And how useful it would be not only as an
exercise in composition, but in defining also,
and spelling. Perhaps it would not- be necessary for the pupils always to copy the long
lessons of words in these cases; but rather
make a common use of the black board, and
reserve the space on their slates for their
blank sentences, and for other operations.
I have spoken of what is, and what is not
absolutely necessary in teaching, in our
schools, the art of composingwell. But whatever may or may not be indispensably necessary, there are two special exercises which
are, to say the least, very convenient, and useful; for which the slate and pencil are as well
adapted as pencil and paper are. I refer to
keeping a journal, and letter writing.
These two special exercises are so valuable
that, perhaps, I use too cold a word when I
say they are very convenient. In fact I must130
consider them, in the education of my own
children, quite indispensable.
Keeping a journal is, I think, the first in
order. In this journal-prepared of course,
at first, on the slate-the child should be encouraged.to write down his own thoughts, and
to some extent his feelings; not merely a single set of occasional ones, but as they recur
from hour to hour. They need not, at first--
indeed they should not-be exhibited to any
individual but the teacher.
I am quite at loss why this practice is so
little in vogue in our best schools. In a few,
I know, it- is common, and in its results very
happy; but in general it is as much overlooked, as if the thing were wholly impracticable. Nothing, as it seems to me, would, at
a suitable age, and proper degree of progress,
under suitable circumstances, and under the
direction of a judicious teacher, be more interesting to the pupils; and few things.would
be more useful. It could never come to be
considered in the light of mere drudgerylike writing on grave subjects, such as Polite-:ness, Self-government, Good manners, &amp;c.Two or three things should be required in
teaching composition, to which no attention
need be paid in the mere incorporation of words
into sentences. For I deem it desirable to
render those exercises as simple as they can
possibly be made.
The first thing to which I refer is a correct
use of capital letters. The right use of these
can hardly be learned by rules; it is best acquired by long practice. Perhaps it will be
well for the teacher to give examples of their
mis-application, as a means of exciting interest and rendering their right use more obvious,
and the whole subject more intelligible.
The second thing referred to is the right
disposition of words in the line. Some crowd
their words too much; others leave too much
space between them. Some leave no marginial space on the slate or paper; others leave
too much; and others again have their space
very irregular.  A due attention to these,small matters adds greatly to the beauty of
both slate writing and writing on paper.
Another thing there is, which deserves
nmore attention than all else'which I haveoi 32
named in these paragraphs; it is the punctuation,  We should not be tedious with the
young; and yet a correct punctuation of what
they write is highly desirable, and may be
gradually obtained. It is especially desirable
in letter writing. My own rule is, to punctuate in such a manner as to make what IL
write, mean what I intend to have it mean;
and I know not whether I am governed by
any other rule. But children cannot be governed, even by this rule; much less by rules
which are still more arbitrary. I would,
therefore, endeavor to secure the point by long
practice; in doing which the black board and
the slate will subserve a valuable purposeThe mechanical use of these marks, so far as
they may be justly said to have a mechanical
use is also sooner and more easily acquired
on the black board, than in any other manner.CHAPTER         IX.
READING.
No complaint in relation to common schools
is more general than the want of suitable
reading books. Children, it is said, do not
understand what they read; and when they
do partly understand it, their knowledge is so
imperfect, that they cannot read in a natural
and proper manner.
There is much reason for this complaint.The great, or at least the fundamental rule in
regard to reading is, c" Read as you talk.'--
But it is impossible to comply with such a
rule as this, in regard to one in twenty of the
lessons in reading which we present to our
children. They should be able not only to
read and understand, at a glance, the words
they are about to utter, but also to see forward134
several words beyond those which they are
reading, and perceive the connection or relation, and the meaning of both.
I am aware that there is a great difference
in school books. Some few which have been
prepared of late years, are certainly preferable to Scott's Lessons, the English Reader,
and the American Orator. And yet not one
that I have seen is so well adapted to the
wants of beginners, as could be wished; nor
do I know that a First Book can be prepared
which would be, in every respect, what we
need, unless those who are to use it, have first
been disciplined, pretty well, on the slate and
black board.
But what is the kind of slate and black
board discipline in reading which is requisite,
as a preliminary to the use of reading books?
This it will be my object in the present chapter, to point out.
It has been seen that both in Spelling and
Composition, the pupil will be led to the formation of sentences, and sometimes long ones.
Indeed, it has been already observed that some
of the more ingenious, or more advanced, in15 O
elder classes, will not only form simple sentences, but even write out anecdotes, of considerable length.  I have known a boy ten
years of age to write out on his slate an anecdote, equal in length to nearly a whole page
of an ordinary reading book.
The slate and black board method of teaching reading, then, has this peculiarity and
excellence, that each pupil, at his first attempts,
reads only his own thoughts, as he has put
them together in the construction of his sentences.  In this way he must of necessity,
understand what he reads; and his reading if
properly conducted, in other respects, must
be intelligible to others..
Let us suppose the following list of words
to have been given out on the black board;
with a request that the pupils would incorporate them into sentences or stories of their own
construction. It is a list of the names of various sorts of buildings.
dwelling house factory        shed
church        shop            wrood house
school house  store*
tavern         barn
*Shop and store are used in this way, almost universally in New Eng~
land136
This, to be sure, is to be presented primarily as an exercise in composition; and is given
to the whole class or school indiscriminately.
True, they are not compelled to frame or incorporate into sentences every word of the
lesson, unless they have time enough, or are
disposed to do it. But what they do incorporate, in this way, it is expected they will incorporate so accurately as to be willing to exhibit the results of their efforts on the black
board.
Perhaps the first pupil, incorporates the
words into sentences in the following manner.
"The church, in this village, has a very
tall steeple.
A church is usually much larger than a
dwelling house, because it is made to hold more
people.  e
Our school house is painted red, and has a
turreti.
There is a cotton factory in the north eastern part of this town, and an axe factory in
the south part.137
We have in -         a shoe maler's shlop,
and also a carpenter and joiner's shop.
I always like to go into a book store; for I
love to see the books, even if I do niot buy
them.
There is a barn in this tcm-7n which is covered with straw.
What a long shed for horses and carriages,
there is back of the church?
I wish we had a wood hozse belonging to
this school house; or at least a shed.
Mr. Roberts keeps the only tavern we have
in our village."
These sentences may be thought too learned
to be the production of very young pupils.And yet I can truly say, that I have known
pupils of from seven to ten years, whose efforts, and indeed almnost their first efforts-I
mean in preparing sentences for reading-indicated quite as much intelligence as the above
sentences.
But suppose the pupil who has formed these
sentences, is called out to write one or more
of them on the black board, and then read it
before the school; is there a doubt that he138
would read it intelligibly? How could he do
otherwise? Let it be, if you please, the second of them. In ordinary common school
reading, such a sentence, from beginning to end,
or at least till we come to the last syllable,
would be read in a straight line, as it were,
without rising or falling inflection, and without
emphasis; in other words, it would be read in a
cold, unintelligible, monotonous manner.
But would itlbe read thus by the pupil who
had formed it for himself? Would he stand
at sixes and sevens, while reading it? Would
he be found now resting on this leg; now on
that; now inclining his head this way, perhaps casting a sideways glance at something
or somebody in another part of the room--and
now resting it on the opposite shoulder?Would not the eye be at least partially lighted
up, while he should give us the reason--important to him, however common place to us
why churches should be larger than dwelling
houses?  Would every word and every syllable be pronounced in the same tone or pitch
of voice till he come to the last, from which
he would suddenly fall, as it into a ditch or139
slough?  Would not church and dwelling house,
and above all people, be pronounced with
more force, or in other words with more emphasis than the smaller and less important
words between them? It is impossible it
should not be so; and hence we see, at once,
the superiority of this kind of reading lessons.
The superiority of this method of teaching
reading, however, in one or two respects, is
not wholly seen at the first glance. It demands a few moments of reflection.
While children, at school, are learning to
read in the ordinary manner, there is so little
which they can understand, or rather which
they do understand, that they form the habit
of reading every thing in the same moniotonous manner, whether it is in their power to
understand it or not; and this habit often adheres to them through life. There are multitudes, among us, who often read whole pages
-I had almost said whole volumes--without
attaching any ideas to them, except that the
monotony of feeling and thought is broken in
upon, here and there, by something particularly exciting. The scriptures often speak of'1 40
having eyes and seeing not, ears and hearing
not, &amp;c.; and it is really true of many persons who were taught in our common schools,
that they go through life, so far as their mere
reading is concerned, very much in this condition. They read over page after page, in
the most unintelligible- and if they read
aloud, in the most monotonous-manner, and
scarcely know that they have been reading.
Or if the mind is not wholly absent, it is so
-loosely attracted to the subject before it, that
the slightest cause is sufficient to turn it aside,
or divert it from its mill horse track.
On this subject, as well as many others, I
can speak with feeling, for I speak from sad
experience. Hardly a day of my life passes,
even at this advanced period of it, in which I
do not detect myself in this very condition,
that of having eyes and seeing not, and having
ears and hearing not. I am most mortified,
however, in reading the Scriptures; for partly
as the result of this self same cause, and partly
on account of the neglect of my teachers to
explain what ought, in reading such a book,
to have either been explained to me or omit141.
ted. I am more- in the habit of reading the
Bible in a monotonous manner than any other
book.
Nor is it to reading, merely, that the monotony extends, We are the more likelyfrom this habit of monotony-to do. other
things in the same monotonous manner. Our
habits are like ourselves, of a herding character. Monotony and stupidity in doing one
thing, are apt to be followed by monotony and
indifference in other things. So that the
wretched manner of reading which so extensively prevails in our schools, iw after all, no
very trifling matter.
But to return to our illustrations. Not only
should the pupils, after forming their sentences, be required to write them on the black
board and read them in the hearing of their
companions, but they should be criticised by
them. By this I mean that each pupil of the
class or school should be permitted to correct
any defects in his reading which he might
observe.
This is not said in ignorance of the fact that
there are pupils in every school who are liable142
to abuse this privilege and become hypocritical, or fond of criticising for the:sake of criticising. But the teacher would of course have
the staff of power in his own hands, and could
call on whom he pleased to make the corrections or criticisms. He would be likely, in
general, to call on those who- would nmake the
best use of the permission.
To introduce this last exercise, I have been
accustomed to read wrong, by design; and
ask my pupils to correct me. As a mere introduction to'the exercise, I still think this
may be well biit in many cases, there will
be errors enough which are real, without resorting to artificial ones.
The corrections may have reference to every
thing which pertains to good reading. The
pupils should be taught to observe, in the first
place, whether he who reads his sentence reads
loud enough. -Sometimes his voice will be too
high.,so-mefiies in too low a key.  In general,
except in cases and circumstances so rare as to
form mere exceptions to a general rule, the
voice in reading should be natural; that is at'143
the usual pitch of the individuals ordinary
conversation.  
cc He did not," says one pupil, "articulate
the letter b plainly enough, in the word because; or if the b was sounded, it was not
sounded distinctly."  "He read too fast, I
think;" says another who is asked to give
the result of his observations. Will you come
then and stand' at the desk and'read it.? the'
teacher will perhaps say; and thus show us,how. fast we ought to read?  Sometimes, indeed, a pupil may be permitted to read the
sentence without'leaving his seat; but in
general there' is an obvious advantage in requiring him to go to the black board, and
read it.- -.
("He pronounced the word usually," says
one, "as if it was spelled ushally;" that is'With only three syllables."  In such a case
there is nothing better than to require the
pupil who makes the criticism, to read.the.
senteince'himself;, and give" to each and every
word and syllable what ought to be its true
pronunciation and sound.
These criticisms should be extended to the1144
most. minute errors-not indeed at once, but
gradually. There is no way, so far as I know,
in which such rapid progress can be made in
this most important art-the art of readingas the one before us; provided, I mean always, it can be conducted in a proper
spirit.
For example, in reading the sentence,"There is- a barn in this town which is covered with straw," a careful critic would be apt
to detect many errors. One pupil would be
likely to omit to pronounce the first h in the
word which; or at least to pronounce it so
faintly that its place in the word could not
be perceived. Another will not sound the th,
in the word this, with sufficient distinctness.
Another will give a flat or nasal sound, to the
dipthong - ow, in the'word town. This last
fault is very common among us, both in speakiAig and reading, and deserves considerable
attention. It is; indeed a small thing, but we
have quite too many small errors in our
schools; and it is time some of them were
removed.
But- these corrections: may extend farther.145O
They may extend to the tones, inflections and
pauses. In:fine, whatever pertains to.good
reading. may, in its own time and place, come
under consideration.
Let us rcapitulate some of the advantages
of this method of teaching the.art of reading.
1. The dislike of books, which is very comr
mon among the young, is in this way prevented. Having never been imposed upon
them, in connection with tasks, they have no
more reluctance to them, than to any thing
else. Nay, more than this, the slate and
black board exercises, will be a certain means
of inducing them to love books and study
both, whenever we shall see fit to introduce
them.
2. They will be saved the acquisition of
many bad or slovenly habits, as the habit of
holding books badly.; of thumbin g and soiling
them; and above all, of having their eyes on
them, and pretending to read or study, when
their mind and heart are somewhere else.
3. The habit will.be prevented-already
so.fully alluded to-of reading in a monoto146
nous manner.   This single acquisition is
worth more than all the pains it costs.
4. Much expense for books will thereby be
saved. This should always be urged on those
who object to procuring slates and pencils for
all their young children, on account of the
expense. They should be shown that instead
of causing them unnecessary expense, it saves
them, in the course of the education of a large
family of children, many dollars.
5., By furnishing employment to the pupils, it saves--like all other slate,and black
board exercises-the necessity of a large share
of the punishment which it is now usual to
inflict in school; as a considerable part of
this evil is known to have its origin in the
*want of suitable employment.
6. And lastly, by preventing the necessity
of inflicting degrading punishments, and by
promoting, in various other ways, the happiness of the pupils, it'has a better moral tendency, than the usual array of books.
To those who think a pupil is skilled in the
art of reading, in proportion to the number
of pages his class are accustomed to read daily,these slate and black board exercises, will, I
know, be thought objectionablei Such per.
sons, however, should: remember that if long
lessons in reading were really necessary, they
could be attended to afterward; and to how
much better purpose, after this drilling than
before, they best know who have tried theml
But they may be assured they are not necessary.
Nor is it necessary, in order to make a good
or perfect reader, that the pupil should be accustomed, as many suppose he should be, to
read Pitt's,O'Connell's, and WTebster's speeches; and Blair's, Chalmer's, Beecher's, and
Channing's sermons. How sad has been the
mistake of those parents and teachers who have
supposed that if children were set to reading
such lessons as these-so excellent-they
would, inevitably, become good readers. That
there was an influence-they hardly knew
what, or how to de-fine it-to be derived from
reading over and over, from day to day, the
great thoughts of great or good men, which
could not fail to work out in the end, for the
most part, good readers; and that where148
there was a failure, it was owing to the condition-the imperfection I should say-of
humanity.
Yet such parents and teachers there have
been; such in fact there are still. I wish
they were not even numerous. Some such
will, I fear, array themselves in opposition to
slate and black board exereises,.especially in
reading. But let such persons wait, with
patience, the issue of the experiment, if it
seems to them like a.mere experiment. The
old system has been tried a good while, and
we have seen its fruits. Let us try the new
system a few years; and see how it is with
our pupils then.
For myself, I have never had a doubt of
the vast superiority of the new mode. I have
spoken as if it might be regarded in the light
of an experiment. But,, to me, the experiment has been tried, and in this chapter I have
been recording its results.
There is hardly a pupil in our common
schools who will not learn to read more, by
spending half an hour or an hour daily on one
ortwo or three short sentences, which he149
prepares for himself, than in reading over, in
haste, as many pages of that which he neither understands nor cares any thing at all
about,
Let not the idea be rejected that our pupils are best fitted to make their own early
reading lessons. ~ Nothing can be better subbstantiated; nothing is, as I conceive better
established. Let the trial be made fairly,
and in good faith, and I am sure every one
concerned in it will rejoice at the results.
Whether it will be best to teach our
pupils -in the end--to read the sermons and
orations of the able and excellent men of past
and present times, in both hemispheres, is a
question for after consideration.'If, however
children of five or six or seven years of age
can form reading lessons for themselves which
are superior-in their circumstance-to any
other, it is difficult to see any reason why they
may not do the same when they grow older.
For as they advance in knowledge the lessons
they prepare will advance accordingly. Still
it may be well on various accounts, to read1,56
other men's thoughts as a class exercise; ita more advanced period of their pupilageoC A.PTE  X,
ARITJTMETIC0
It my be thought by some that the introduction of black Boards into many of oQr
schools already, and their frequepnt use in the
study of arithmetic, especially when visitors
come in, will preclude the necessity of saying
much under this head.   Yet is it not a fact
that, ev,en in the.study of:arithmetic, the use.of.this highly important instrument is almost
wholly over looked, at least practiclly?  Is
it not common for teachers, after a little
attention to it, at first, to lay it aside, and
-proceed much in the way to whi.eh they have
always been accustomed?
This, however, should.not be o,  Nothing,can be more convenient or more useful in
the'sttudy,of:arith-metic,.by classes, tha,l.l slates152
and black boards, especially the latter. I
speak here, moreover, of teaching in the usual
way of our best schools. I think, however,
that there is a more excellent way of teaching
arithinetic.
Arithllletic is no doubt one of the first
exercises to be presented to the youthful
mind. I am not about to say at what age
this or any other branch should be commenced; the giving of such directions forms
no part of my present purpose. What I say
is, that whenever the work of inculcatingthe
sciences is begun, that of arithmetic, to a
certain extent, should receive our earliest
attention.
It has been usual, of late years, to extol
mental arithmetic. Now it would be foolish
for me to condemn what has been so highly
commended by many wiser men; and yet I
cannothelp thinking sensible arithmetic--arithmetic which is addressed, I mean, to the senses
-should go before and accompany what is
called mental arithmetic. For want of this,
much, I fear, that is done in Our primary and
common schools, under the idea of studying153
mental arithmetic, is of little practical utility.
What does it avail a child, for example, to
be able to solve, almost instantly, as many
can, such a question as the following; found
in Colburn's Mental Arithmetic.
"From Boston to IRoxbury it is three miles;
from Roxbury to Dedham, six miles; from
Dedham to Walpole, eleven miles;, from Walpole to WTrentham, four miles; from Wrentham to Attleborough, four miles; from Attleborough to Pawtucket, nine miles; from Pawtucket to Providence, four miles; how many
miles is it from Boston to Providence?"
For although there is no great difficulty in
reckoning up three, six, eleven, four, four,
nine, and four, and finding that they all make
forty-one, yet what does the child know after
having done this, which he did not know before? You say, and you say justly, perhaps,
that he knows it is 41 miles from Boston to
Providence; and you may possibly tell me. that
he knows the distances of the various places
between, from each other. But is there any
-real knowledge in all this? Might not a parrot be -taught to say it is 41 miles from Boston 

 

154
to Providence; or it is four miles from Wrentham to Attleborough? And yet what evidence should we have that either the child or
the parrot had any clear ideas of the distance
between Boston and Providence, and of that
between Wrentham   and Attleborough?How can a person get any ideas from the
words four miles, or forty-one miles, who
knows nothing about the meaning of one
mile? Yet I am much mistaken if one pupil
in ten has any thing like a correct idea of
distance--miles, rods or furlongs-yards, feet
or inches:.
There is a work to be done preliminary to
all this; and, indeed, preliminary to all other
processes in mental arithmnetic. In the per,
foriiaaneo of this work, the slate and black
board may render us a very important,serviCe. They do not, indeed, give us sensible
objects themselves to compute; they do not
furnish us, as in the foregoing case, the hills
and:vales, and level ground of which a mile,
or eveon a yard of the earth's surface is made
up, and say to us: Here is a mile, or a yard,
as the case might be. Still they furnish us155
with something like a substitute for the objects with which they cannot furnish us.
A child who has not learned it at home already, can learn from the black board and.
slate-i. e. with the teachers aid--how much
an inch is, and how much a foot and a yard
are, respectively. And having found out how
much a foot and a yard are, and become familiar with them in their application to objects in the room, especially the floor of the
school room, it is not difficult to show him,
by repeating the yard five and a half times,
on the floor, how imuch a rod is. This is as
far as we can go within the school room, and
as far, in this particular exercise, as the slate
and black board will accompany us.
Now in order to understand clearly how
much a mile is, the, child ought to make the
distance of a rod his measure, and apply it to
the play ground, the common, the road near the
school house, and in fine to several different
roads or streets. He finds, perhaps, that the
play ground is ten rods long; the common
forty; the road adjoining the school house, in
ts straight part, before it comes to a bend,156
just eighty. This he may be told is a quarter
of a mile; and if he knows how much a quarter of a thing is, it is easy, by repeating tlhis,
in some way fobur times, to get the idea of a
mile; especially if some road is shown him
which is just four times as long as the portion
which he already knows is a quarter of a
mile.
Perhaps the elementary ideas which a pupil needs in order to be able to talk intelligibly in the study of arithmetic-or in fact in
any thing else-about miles, are among the
most difficult, (except perhaps years,) which
could be mentioned. Yet, they must be acquired, or the pupil is talking about that
which has no meaning, to him.
The elementary ideas which go to make
up a pound, or a bushel, or a barrel, or a dollar, are confessedly much more easy to be
obtained; though children seldom obtain correctly even these. What child has any clear
and definite idea,what relation a cent or' ten
cents have to one hundred cents, or a dollar?
or an ounce to a pound? or a quart to a
bushel or a barrel? Yet is it not obvious157
that these elementary ideas are the very ideas
he needs as a preliminary to all study which,
like arithmetic, involves or includes the frequent use of these terms? And what are
like the slate and the black board, as mea ns
or instruments of acquiring this knowledge?
In proof of this let a child be shown, by a
figure-say of a cup-on the black board,
about how large a vessel must- be in order to
hold a quart; or, what is better still, show
him a quart measure. Perhaps he has seen
one-if he has, the cup itself, or the rough
drawing on the black board will remind him
of it. Next make eight such drawings on the
black board, for eight quart measures, and
tell him that these, i. e. the contents of eight
such cups, poured together would make a
peck. Afterwards he may be shown, without the least difficulty, that four pecks make
a bushel. But in order to make the whole
thing clear and definite in his mind, curved
lines to represent both a peck and a bushel
basket should be made, on the black board, or
if not these, at least three sides of a square,
7*158
to give a view of wooden measures for a
bushel, a peck, &amp;c.
Or, once more, we wish perhaps to show
him that a dollar is made up of one hundred
cents, or ten dimes. We first show him a
cent, and then a dime, and tell him that ten
of these copper cents are worth as much, or
will buy just as much, as a silver piece, called
a dime. Show him, moreover, by making on
the black board ten circular lines about the
dimensions of a cent, and tell him to count
them; and then, with the understanding that
they represent cents, tell him that the ten are
worth just as much--and in fact make just as
much--as one dime, represented by the smaller circle. Again show him that ten dimes
represented by ten smaller circles, make up
just one dollar represented by a larger circle,
in the same way.
It is not intended, here, I say once more,
to prescribe the exact method which every
teacher shall pursue; or the precise instruments by means of which he shall make the
intended impression on the minds of his pupils. If the things themselves could be had159
-as they can be at home, but not always at
the school room--the measures, some grain
or beans, a suitable number of pieces of money,
&amp;c., they would doubtless be preferable to any
representations, such as those to which I have
referred, on the slate or the black board.]But some preliminary instruction of this sort,
I say once more, is indispensable; or there
will be no true or real knowledge, in the particular line which we are now considering.
I might even go much farther than I have
yet, done, and affirm-and that, too, without
fear of contradition by auy who are familiar
with the juvenile mind and habits-that a pupil may talk very learnedly about mental
arithmetic, and may be able to solve such a
question as that before us, with great rapidity,
and yet know nothing at all to any practical
purpose about the relative proportion'of numbers, even small numbers. Is there one pupil in three who clearly and distinctly perceives that if Roxbury is three miles from
Boston, and Dedham six miles from Roxbury,
(the space between Roxbury and Dedham,) is
just twice as great as that between Roxbury160
and Boston? Or, vice versa, that the distance
between the latter two places is just half that
between the other two.*
Some may think that I under-value, or at
least unider-rate, the powers of the young
mind; but let those who think so, examine
for themselves and see. Let--- it be remembered, however, that I am speaking here of
young pupils; and not of these who are fifteen or sixteen years old. Let those, I say,
who are skeptical on this point, examine for
themselves.
But this relation of distance is soon and
easily taught with the aid of the black board,
especially to those who have been already
introduced to map making. A map of two
or three towns may be drawn, and lines passed
through them for roads. Thus in the case
before us, Boston and Roxbury may be drawn,
together with the Providence turnpike, passing through the latter. The road from Boston centre to Roxbury may be divided, by
means of the chalk, into three equal parts,
* In point of fact Dedham is seven miles from Roxbury; but this mistake
is of little consequence in arithmetical questions and exercises,161
representing three miles; and the road from
Roxbury to Dedham into six equal parts; the
divisions to correspond in extent to the others;
and let each pupil see the proportion and the
difference.*  Then let the road be extended
-but for this purpose, the drawing should be
on a scale small enough to admit it-to Providence, marking off into miles the spaces between the several towns. Now, if the pupils
will be honest, I have no doubt nearly all
will at once acknowledge that till now they
had no idea at all of the relative proportion
of the numbers, three, six, eleven, four, &amp;c.
Once more. " Seven times seven make
forty-nine," thousands and millions of voices
have vociferated, in our schools, when they
had no more idea of the relative proportion of
the several sevens to each other than if they
had never uttered an articulate sound. All,
all is mere memory work; parrot work. I do
not say I would have none of it; for that is
quite another question. But this I do affirm,
that such memory work is not knowledge;
* Thus: - ----..162
real, practical knowledge. Till a pupil learns,
in one way, or another, by the intervention
of sensible objects of some sort, or thteir representatives, (as dots or squares, or circles, on
the black board or slate,) the true relation
which seven ones, and seven sevens have to
each other, he is no arithmetician.  His mental arithmetic, as it is called, has no permanent
basis, but is built on sand.
How easy it is to establish this relation of
numbers, by means of seven rows of seven
dots each?  Or, if we choose, squares or circles may be used instead of dots.  For various reasons, however, I prefer the dots, or
if not dots, the representations of various little
objects, as beans, corns, pins, small pieces of
money, and the like.
Here is a specimen, on a small scale, of
what may be done by the black board, on a
larger one.163
What has been said, in this chapter, and in
the chapter on map nraking, opens to the inquisitive and intelligent teacher, and to the
pupils also, who are hungering and thirsting
after knowledge, a wide field for slate and
black board exercises. How little have we
thought of the vast amount of preliminary
instruction which it is so needful to give; and
how little of the value of those instruments by
which it can so readily be given!
But we will take for granted that the preliminary knowledge to which I altude has
been given, and that the pupils have been
taught how to form the nine digits with the
cypher. They know nothing, as yet, of any164
combinations of the digits or figures, nor of
their properties, individual or collective.Preparatory to the study of written arithmetic, here, too, is a considerable work for the
slate and black board.
One of the first exercises of this sort is to
learn to write the figures in perpendicular
rows.  Thus:
1       8
2       5
3       4
4       2
5       6
6       1
7       3
8       9
9       0
0       7
It requires both skill and practice to place
figures in perpendicular rows. It is not so
difficult,to write them in rows horizontally,
as below.
1  2   3   4   5  6   7   8   9   0
9  8   7   6   5  4   3   2   1   0165
Some think it is best to draw lines on the
slate and black board, both perpendiculars and
horizontals, letting the lines cross each other
to form squares; a figure being then written
to each square. But I do not think this advisable. If a scholar begins to be dependent
on ruled lines, he will be apt to continue dependent. I would, therefore, at once place
my dependence on the eye, and on long practice.
Here, in this matter, of writing figures, pupils will learn chiefly from imitation. The
copy of the teacher on the black board will
be worth every thing to'them. As fast as the
teacher puts down a figure, let it be imitated;
and when a row is copied or a sufficient number of rows for a lesson, let the whole be corrected by the teacher or a monitor; or, what
is perhaps still better, by the pupil hlimself,
standing at or before the black board.
Perhaps large lessons, (or at least deep perpendicular rows,) will- be as usefui as any other
in teaching pupils how to write figures with
method aid order; something like the following.166

Another good exercise is to accustom them
to follow the lines correctly, where the numbers, or sums are not of uniform value. The
following is -a specimen of a lesson of this
sort.

It is well known to be much more difficult
to keep perpendicular or vertical rows distinct,
where the horizontal ones are of different
lengths; and yet it is highly desirable to acquire the habit of being able to do so. This,
as I have already said, is the appropriate
work of the black board and the slates, and
should be persevered in, till a pretty good
share of skill is acquired in the exercise.
Every teacher who has had any acquaintance at all with the black board, knows how
useful it is in teaching numeration, addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division; indeed all the various rules and processes which
belong to arithmetic, It is hardly necessary168
that I should dwell, therefore, on these. I
will only say, once for all, proceed slowly,
and do not suffer the anxiety of the pupils to
get forward from one rule to another, or from
the black board to the book, or that of their
parents on their behalf, urge you on a step
faster than the good of the pupils obviously
demands. I know how difficult it is not to
hurry on; and this makes me the more anxious to prevent it.  Make haste, indeed,
every where, and in all things; or at least,
waste no time. And yet there is much of
meaning and of good sense, too, in thlle saying
or maxim, which I have so often quoted;
"Make haste slowly.'
If tables are to be committed to memory,
such as the multiplication table, tables of
weight and measure, tables of time, &amp;c., it is
well to make this, too, a slate and black board
exercise. Not, indeed, that I would ever
write the whole multiplication table on the
black board, or indeed the whole of any other
table at once; but only such parts as were
suitable for a single lesson. But when written, in this way, I would make great efforts.169
to have the whole portion, which is put down
at one time, committed to memory. They may
transfer it fromn the black board to their slates
or not,as may seem best and most useful,in the
circumstances.
It may excite a little surprise, perhaps, that
I should put my thoughts on the use of tables,
with the methlods of teaching them, at the
close of my chapter on Arithmetic, rather than
at the beginning. Nevertheless I -am quite
confident that this is the proper place for it,
Many a scholar is disgusted with arithmetic
forever, by being compelled, at the outset, to
commit to memory a host of unintelligible
tables, rules, &amp;c.
If addition tables, subtraction tables, miultiplication tables, tables of weight, measure,
time, currency, &amp;c., &amp;c., are to be committed
to memory at all, let them be in small portions
of each at a time, and let one table, or portion
of a table, be thoroughly learned before proceeding to another.  Thus, if we commence
with the table of avoirdupois weight, let that
occupy the black board, (especially if there
be a smaller black board and a larger one,) tillit is wholly committed to memory. If the
multiplication table is the subject, let that be
followed up till it is mastered. Only a part
of this long table, however, should stand on
the slate at one time, say a single division of
it, as from 4 times 4 are 16 to 4 times 12 are
48.
Many teachers insist on having a pupil
commit to memory the principles, &amp;c. of each
rule, before he is permitted to work in that
rule.; but the utility of this requisition is to
say the least doubtful. I have thought it
betterI-- still think so-o -to order things,
as to have the rule appear to be derived from
the exercise under it,:rather than the exerci:
ses from the rule. In this way, as growing
out of the exercises, I think a rule simply expressed, and written down on the black board,
and by each pupil on his slate, much more
likely to be effectually impressed on the mem.
ory, than if it were merely committed to
memory, without being written.CHAPT4ER X- li
GEOGRAPHYk
The pupil having already become familiar
With making geometrical figures and drawing.simple maps, that is outlines of places with
which he is famaliarly acquainted, and having
above all, obtained correct ideas of. distance,
so as to have, as it were a basis for his ideas
to rest upon, is now ready to go forward with
a more extended study of geography.
In pursuance of this branch, however, I
would keep in view, as much as possible, the
general principle already laid down and in.
sisted ont-hat of beginning at&amp;home, in every
thing; or in other words, proceeding, always,
from the known to the unknown.  This principle is particularly applicable to the study of
geography.172
And yet, important principle as it is, I can~
not say I would never depart from it. On
the contrary I am strongly inclined to think
that we ought to depart frorn it, at times;
that we should teach not only geography but
some other branches, both ways, by analysis
and by synthesis. Not at first, indeed, but
after the pupil has made some progress.
Geography should be begun with map
making; taking it up, perhaps, where it was
left, in the exercises described in the chapter
on that subject. It will be recollected that
little was then proposed, however, except the
merest outlines of the school room and grounds,
the commons and roads near that, and perhaps the town in which they are situated.---
Nothing was said of making out, on the county
and state maps proposed, the rivers, mounfains, and other natural objects which render a map so attractive as well as valuable;
and the location of which, by the learner, is
so useful an exercise.
In studying geography,, as geography, however, it would be of the highest importance to
insert, in all our maps, the rivers, mountains,173
lakes, seas, &amp;c. The position of cities, towns,
&amp;c., should also be indicated in some way. In
general it is preferable to write the names of
places, near the little circle or square which
is; made to point out its exact lccation.
In commencing the study of geography
regularly, the teacher should always begin
with the black board; and with the town in
which his school is located. He should designate not only its shape, but its principal
roads, with its village or villages; its rivers
and brooks, (those at least of any size;) its
mountains and hills; its lakes, seas, and bays;
and even its principal churches, factories, &amp;c.
To this end, it is true, the teacher must have
books and maps, unless, indeed, he is a complete encyclopedia of topographical knowledge;
but what then?   No man can, be a professional man, not even a mechanic-I mean a
skilful and profitable one--without the imnplements of his occupation or profession.
Suppose a teacher and his pupils in Hartford, about to draw an outline of the town.*
e I have selected Hartford as s a poit from which to b}egin, both because X
8174
Shall it be drawn,according to the size of
which it appears on our larger maps of the
state? Or shall it be somewhat larger? To
draw it as large as it is represented, on some
of the maps of the city and town would be,
obviously, quite inconvenient, because though
there might be room enough for it on the black
board, there would not be on the slates. Besides
it should not occupy all the space even on one
side of a slate.  There should be room enough
for a part or all of thEe contiguous towns, in
order to show its relations and boundaries.Perhaps it is best for a teacher to draw it as
large as can be copied on the smaller slates,
with such room for boundaries as would be
necessary.
The map of Hartford might be drawn on
the black board about three inches long, from
north to south, and of proportional width;
viz, from an inch and a half to two inches.--
Hartford is almost a parallelogram  or long
square; though its eastern boundary is somewhat irregular, being formed by the river.
am more familiar with the place than most others, and because its boundad'
Ties and those of the adjacent towns are particularly easyito describe,175
The Connecticut river is a line so distinct
and prominent that portions of the towns east
of it would hardly be necessary, or if necessary at all, only very small portions of them.
A very narrow strip of East Hartford and
East Windsor would include the central villages and churches. But in order to make its
relation to Farmington and Avon on the west
as prominent as it ought to be, it would be
well to have the mere outlines, (in fainter
strokes,) of both these places drawn, and also
the Southern portion of Bloomfield and Windsor. I would include about the half of IWethersfield, (the more important part,) and a corner of Britain society in Berlin. Parther than
this, unless the slates were all of a sufficient
length to admit it with freedom, I would not
go I except it were to the eastward beyond
the river.
Much importance should be attached to the
correctness of each of the town lines. Thus
beginning with,the line between Hartford and
Farmington and Avon--which is nearly
straight, and runs almost due north and south,176
and might for simplicitty's sake be represented
exactly so--I would draw this just three inches long; and every pupil should be required
to, do the same. This line I would make the
lnucleus, as it were, of the map'; on which, or
around which, I would attach or connect the
resit
it is important to begin, always, with the
simplest line, provided it is of sufficient length
to form a proper starting point  The importance too, of having each pupil trained to the
art of drawing perpendicular, horizontal and
other lines, as well as of judging in regard to
measures of length-inches and feet especially-cannot but be obvious.
From the bottom of this north and south
line-the western boundary of Hartfordstrike off one at right angles, that is horizontally
to the river, of just two inches. That at the
north should be made next, but is more difficult. A line should be carried from the top
of the long line or western'boundary, horizontally, or eastward, nearly one inch; then
it should be turned exactly south, a very lit.177
tie distance perhaps about -the tweltth ot axn
inch, -after which it should be again carried
horizontalily, or: eastward, a little more than
two4thirds of an inch.  The eastern line, or
river alone-remains to be made; dand will be
the most difficult of all.
-f, however, a teacher.has studied his isubject
well before hand, is skillful at drawing, and
has a correct eye as'to distance, he will not
be long in leading:his pupils to the formation
of very good outlines of the town,of Hartford.
Many corrections will no doubt be necessary
in the progressof the exercise, especially in the
construction of the river line; but time and
patience:will enable him  and his pupils to
make them;-perfect accuracy, of course not
being expected.
The additional lines--intended to represent
the boundaries, either partially or wholly, of
the adjoining towns--vill be very easily added to the former; especially:as they are, in
general, extensions of them, or mere offsets
from them.  They should be added as soon
as the foregoing outline is.completed; but178
need not be made with so much accuracy.
One, for example, should be carried due north
from the northwest corner, of Hartford-say
two thirds of an inch; fro m which a line carried
westward, two inches, will form the north
line of Avon, and another:parallel to it and
about an inch and a quarter south of it will
form the southern line of the same township.
The line running westward and south westward
between Farmington and Britain cannot be
so well described here, but is pretty easily
made.                       s p      e
A correct idea of the points of the compass, is also, as will be seen, highly indispensable; but may be soon and easily acquired,
in connection with such maps. There are I
know, a great many of our pupils-some,'I
fear, who can hardly be called young oneswho know as: little, (as Joseph Emerson has
well said,) what we mean when we tell them
that the top of a map is north, and the bottom
south, as they would if we should tell them
the top is roro and the bottom' cluro. But
here they see that Bloomfield and Windsor170
are at the top of the map, and they know that
these places are north of Hartford-at least
most of our pupils do. The river Connecticut, they find winding along the eastern side
of the way, and they know that this is in accordance with their own daily observation.Wethersfield and the State Prison they know
to be South; and here, on the bottom of the
map, they find them. So Farmington they
know to be west; and in the West they accordingly find it.
Now, I do not say that there are not other
ways-some of them more expiditious even
-in which to get a correct idea of north and
south on the map; but I do say that this
seems to me to be the true way, and almost
the only true way.
But the map is not completed when the
-boundary lines are drawn, and even when the
pupil becomes familiar with the relative position of the adjacent places, and their boundaries, according to the points of the compass.
The small river sometimes called Little River,
which comes in from the west, is to be drawn  180
the city is to be located, and West Hartford;'and several objects are to be marked in the
City itself, as the College, the Deaf and Dumb
Asylum, the Retreat for the Insane, the Orphan Asylum,;the State House, &amp;c. Itmight
be well, moreover, to mark the situation of
the mountains, in the borders of Avon and
Farmington, on which are to be seen Wadsworth tower.
It is indeed true that not every town and
its vicinity, are so favorably situated for the
purpose we are now considering as Hartford.
And yet some may be more so. There are,
in truth, very few that have not within them,'a number of natural or artificial objects sufficiently great to arrest and detain for a short
time the attention of a class of pupils. There:are few of oui towns, which have in them no
rivers, brooks, ponds, mountains, hills, or,caves,; perhaps none vwhich are without church,
factory, literary or benevolent institution,
court house, or jail.
We are inot, however, to study the geography of our own native town, and the towns18 1
adjacent, for tlhe sake of a knowledge of those
towns, in itself considered, so much as for the
sake of making a beginning, by doing that
which is equivalent to what is called, by mechanics, getting the use of tools. The pupil
needs to understand the use of a map; how
it is made, and how to make it. The longer,
therefore, he can be detained on this first lesson, without losing his interest in the exercise, the better; because he will thereby become, as he. should be, thoroughly acquainted
with the terms of geography, and of map
making as connected with geography.
Every map, at first, should be as mere an
outline as possilble. The fewer the lines and
marks, the more more distinct and permanent
will be the impression on the pupils' minds.
I would not, therefore, be in haste to fill up
even the map of one's own native town. A few
only of the more striking features should be
inserted. Other things may be talked about,
and the pupils may even be told where they
should be placed on the map, were they to be
8*1.82
put down. But farther than this, at first, it
will not be well to go.
Another exercise is necessary, in order to
fit the pupil to go forward in his studies with
intelligence. He must be taught to make a
map of his native town, on a reduced scale.
Take the case which has just been considered. Draw the outlines of Hartford on a
smaller scale than before. Let the first line
formed-the western boundary-be but one
inch, instead of three; and let the rest be in
proportion.
This will prepare the way for making a
map of the -w,hole of Hartford county. For
on this reduced scale, any slate in school
would hold all the towns in the county, without the least possible difficulty. At the same
time we should accustom the pupil to a dissected map of the same county. He can
hardly be made too familiar with the geography of his own town and county, or with the
shape and position, relatively, of the States
and Territories of our Union. He.should also be made familiar with the general shape183
of the United States and its Territories, taken
as a whole, and the general position of the
same with relation to the countries around.
For this purpose he must be able to put together a dissected map of North America; to
which, subsequently, we should add South
America.
How far it is best to proceed in this way,
in this going from the known to the unknown
-I am not certain. A time will arrive, however when the question of the shape of the
earth will naturally come in. This may be
when the teacher is conversing with his pupils about Connecticut river. They may ask,
Where does the water in Connecticut river
come from? or, Where does it go? and, If the
rivers are constantly running into the ocean,
why does not the tatter get full?
Or the question of the earth's rotundity
may not come up till some knowledge is acquired of the shape and relative position of
the continents and oceans, and the teacher begins to converse with them about going from
place to place; as from America to Asia, toEntered according to an Act of Congress, in the year 1857,

the South Sea Islands, or to China. Some ingenious pupil may be struck with surprise to
find that we can get to China both by going
eastward and westward, and may ask an explanation. If so, this will be the proper time
to inform the class that the earth is round;
and to make, by means of the black board,
every possible explanation.  I say every
possible one; because it will not be possible
to make the subject very intelligible without
a globe of some sort, if it is simply an apple.
And yet when the knowledge has once
been imparted and received that the earth is
round, a great deal may be done by means of
slates and black boards to make the matter
more intelligible and practical than otherwise
it would be. For very few pupils who have
long been familiar with niaps and globes, and
who are able to.tell us, parrot-like, that China
is on the opposite side of the globe from that
on which they stand, and Cape Horn, a quarter of the way round the globe, have any distinct idea of the real rotundity of the earth,
after all.18 85'For proof of this let one of these unfledged
geographers be asked to tell which way a
cannon should be pointed in order to shoot a
ball, if the thing were possible, to ChinaoWould he not say at once, that it ought to be
pointed eastward? And when asked to point
his own finger in the same direction, would
he not hold it horizontally with respect to the
earth's surface? Would he not do the same
with respect to Cape'Horn? And yet, if the
earth is round, this could not be right. To
point the finger or a piece of cannon toward
China-that is really and truly to do so-it
must be placed perpendicularly with respect
to the surface of the earth, and not horizontally; and to point to Cape Horn, it must be
placed at an angle of about 45 degrees with
the earth's surface.
Now all this, and a thousand other kindred
facts, tending to show that the earth is practically round, as well as theoretically so, might
be made intelligible on the black board;
where a globe was not at hand. More than
even this; I am not sure that the black board186
is not better for this purpose than a globe possibly can be.
Let it be required of the pupil to tell, as
above, in what course China really lies from
New England. To make the matter plain to
him, the teacher may draw a circle on the
black board, representing, that is designed to
represent, a section, or slice, of the earth from
west to east, or a section of the artificial globe,
in the same direction. Then by showing him
that here, on the upper part of the circle, is
New England, and there on the lower part is
China, and drawing a line from the former to
the latter, we may make the thing intelligible
to him. Here, the teacher says, a cannon
ball shot off from New England to China,
must go in the precise course in which I am.drawing this line.
Again, let it be required to find out the
course of Cape Horn from New England. To
this end we make a circle on the black board
representing a section or slice of the earth
through from north to south, and say: Here
is New England and thlere is Cape Horn; and1.87
now you see that if I draw a straight line
with the piece of chalk, from New England to
Cape Horn, it passes in an oblique direction,
or 45 degrees below the horizon.
But to return to our work of map making,
and map dissecting. Nothing, as it seems to
me, is so useful in studying geography, as the
simultaneous use of the slate and black board,
and dissected maps. I serio-usly doubt whether
it is of any real advantage to put books into
the hands of a child who is studying geography, till he has been drilled at least two or
three years with slate, black board, and a globe.
Maps he needs to see-good maps--no matter
how many; but no books.
Granted that in order to have the school
derive the full benefit of this plan of instruction in geography, the teacher must be master
of the science. He must be able to draw, at
a moment's warning, the outlines of any country in the world; and not only to draw the
outlines, but to fill it up. NTot that a teacher
ought himself to do either of these very often,
at least without any aid from the pupils. He188
should be continually referring every thling to
their memory, judgment, &amp;c.
To recur, once more, to the map of Hartford, on the smallest or last mentioned scale.
This being drawn, the teacher says: I wish
now to add Wethersfield; on which side of
Hartford shall I place it?  If they say on the
south side, he asks them which the south side
is. Here, he says, is Hartford, on the black
board; you see its boundaries; shall I place
Wethersfield at the top or bottom, or at one
side? Or, if at one side, on which side? A
large map of the whole State, with every
township distinctly marked off by lines, will
of course be, in pursuance of this plan, quite
a necessary article.
Having drawn the boundaries of Wethersfield, all except perhaps the eastern, he asks,
Is this right? What is wanting in order to
have it right? Which boundary is wanting?
What forms this boundary?  In what direction does the river run? From what town or
towns does the river separate it? What other towns do you know of, which are bounded189
on their eastern side by Connecticut river, besides Hartford and Wethersfield:? What towns
do you:know of'that arebounded on their
western side by!the same.river?
Here is one..f the boundaries of Wethersfield; from  what place or places does it separate it'?  From what places does this boundary separate it?   Is there. any river in
Wethersfield?  Are there any lakes in it?
Any mountains?     Any seas, gulfs or bays?
Let me now hear you mention its boundaries,
in course.
No teacher would be well prepared for these
exercises, in Hartford who was not able, with
the aid of a large map of Connecticut, to draw
the outlines of any township in Hartford
county, or indeed any one adjoining the river,
below it.  He should be so familiar with drawing, moreover, as to be able to draw the outlines of these places with as much rapidity as
he would make the figures used in arithmetic,
or the capital letters used in- writing.*
So.of the States of the Union.  To be able
* The ingenious teacher cannot fail to be able' to apply what is said here, to'his own'town, county,'&amp;c,., and to the towns and:counties adjacent.19(
to teach well, a teacher should be so familiar
with the shape of every State, as to be able,
with a good map of the United States before
him, to draw the outlines of any given State,
in a moment, and to draw it, too, with accuracy; I mean as to its size, proportions, &amp;c.
Suppose he is to draw the outlines of the
State of Connecticut. Now he should have
so clear an idea of tile shape of the State, in
his mind, as not to need any aid at all. Yet
in order to be accurate, it is well, always, for
him to have a good map before him, at least
of the United States, and occasionally to cast
his eye over it. We can never be too accurate or too perfect in these things, when we
consider how permanent the impression is
which they are to make on the minds of our
pupils.
With this skill, he can never fail to find
employment for his pupils-useful employment, too. With the map of the State of
Connecticut before him, he draws the outline
of one of' its counties, and says: This represents the shape of one of the counties in Con191
nectic'ut, can you tell me which it is? What
countyi.lies next to it on the west? What on
the east?  What on the northl?  What on
the south?:
So in regard to the map of the United
States. He draws the boundaries.of one of the
States, and asks what State it is:; what others
join it; and in what direction they are. He
inquires, also, the position of o'ne State with
respedt to'another. Thus he "asks; which
way is the State I' have drawn. from that in
which you live? Suppose it tobe Maryland.
He asks which'way Maryland is from  Ohio
-from   Vermont-from   South Carolina
from Missouri-. from Michigan-from Maine
-from Louisiana, &amp;c.
So, in fact,' in regard to any other map--
the m'p of'the world not accepted. He draws
the outtlines of. Africa, and. asks about its
bound'arites, its bearing from u: from Europe
-from:Asia-from New Holland--from the
South Sea Islands, &amp;c. Or he draws an ocean,
a sea, or a lake, and asks what ocean, sea, or
lake it is; how it is bounded; what of the
same class are larger, or smaller, &amp;c.192
We hence isee that it.is not in the.mere
drawing of the:iitlines cf counties: th'at a
teac:her can profitably use a black'iboard." He
may draw rivers as iwell as countries.  Let
him draw the Missouri, th-e St. Lawrence, the
Oregon, the Oronoke,:the Amazon, the Nile,
the Irawaddy, the'Seine, or the Rhine. Let
him draw them, moreover, in their natural position, and of a proper length and.size and relation to,one another.  Thus the Nile and
Oronoke he should:represent as having a
northern course; -the Amazon'and St. Lawrence an eastern; the Oreg:on a western,
&amp;c. Let him., then,:for another:exercise, ask
what countries lie on, that'!is, near, these
respective rivers? What mountains.give rise
to them?  What cities stand.on their banks?
So interesting-so exceedingly absorbing
and interesting-are these.'.i:exercises, in the
hands of a judicious teacher, Who has a large
black board at his.' command,: that I doubt
whether a better method could be adopted, at
least in a great many instances, to silence a
boisterous school, or to turn the.current of193
rogtuery in a particalar coroner of it, than that
of making some river, as the Nile, and after
describing it, asking questions on it, by way
of review.
I have hitherto mentioned but a very few
things to be attended to in the course of these
introductoryexercises,because I have believed
and still believe that the most accurate and
distinct notions, on this subject, are always
obtained by studying, carefully, at first a few
outlines of each country-not excepting our
own. The boundaries and larger divisions,
with the rivers, mountains, lakes, seas, and
perhaps a few more of the more striking
natural features of a country, with a little
attention to the cities, is perhaps, really all
which is useful, at the firstb
But when considerable time has elapsed,
and these topics become generally familiar,
there are a variety of other exercises which
should come in. One of the most striking,
not to say the most useful, is the following.
The teacher draws the boundary of a
country.-say Francea--and having done this,PREF.A_CE.,

 

THn~importance of the blackboard as an instrument
of instruction in the common schooi, has been insisted on
in every periodical on education which I have seen, either
of this country or Europe; as Well as in almost every
recent treatise on the same subject. It has also been
introduced into most of our improved schools, of every
grade, especially in New England and New York. In
many of our common schools, however, it has been but
barely introduced. The teacher knows almost‘as little
how to use it as his pupils. It is vain, or nearly in vain,
that our more intelligent Committees and even the Sec-
retaries of our Boards of Education urge the importance
of its use, from year to year, so long as no instruction is
given concerning its use. i

It is in this view that I have prepared the following
manual. It is, of course, not designed for pupils, but
solely for teachers. Nor is it intended to be used blindly,
even by teachers themselvesr Let such only of its me-

thods be tried as seem adapted to the circumstances of

puts down his crayon on the northern part of it,
and asks, " were we transported, in an instant,
to this spot, what should we probably see?
Should we see fields and roads fenced out as
they are here?  What sort of houses? What
colored people? How would they be dressed? How do they travel?  What should we
see them doing, besides cultivating the soil?
What crops should we see? What fruit trees
or fruits; What domestic animals?  What
wild animals?  What forest trees?"
Again, just where I place my staff, in the
country whose outlines I have drawn, (which
we will suppose is North America,) is a great
lake; do you know what it is? With what
other lakes does it connect? Into what river
do they empty their contents? Into what
sea or ocean does the river empty itself?What other large lakes are there in the world
besides this and its neighbors? Which way
from us is this lake? Which way is it from
Europe - from Asia - from Africa - from
South America?
But I am afraid I have made suggestions196
in regard to so many exercises that the main
thing, after all, will be forgotton. This is
map making--continued, I had almost said,.
incessant map making. Every thing in regard to the study of geography, intelligently,
depends upon this. But in order to this we
must begin right. He who can make a map.
of his own town, and county, and an outline
of his native State with correctpess, can make
at least the outlines of almost any other part
of the world.
The pupils of our common schools ought to
be able to make a map of any part of the
world-state, country, island, sea, ocean, or
continent-with as much facility and correctness as a skilful teacher of music will write
notes, or a rapid mathamatician make figures.
Nor is there the least difficulty of acquiring
such skill, with time and patience, and suitable instruction.
Nor is there, as I believe, any want of time
for all this. Immense, almost, is the time
wasted by many, nay most of our pupils, in
the progress of their course of common school196.nstruction. Had we but some philosopher's
stone to transmute all into gold, how great
would be the advantage! The discovery of
such a power of transmutation, rather of something equivalent to it, I do not profess to have
made; nevertheless I do profess to have suggested thoughts and plans, which, whether of
my" own invention or borrowed, are worth a
thousand timees more than any philosopher's
stone could be.CHAPTER Xli.
-HISTORY.
The study of History, like that of Geography and many other branches, should begin
at home, with' the known. This, I mean,
is the way to begin with those who are wholly'
ignorant of the subject, and consequently more
or less destitute of interest in regard to it. No&gt;
matter whether they are old or young-eight
years old or eighteen they should commencee
their studies alike, both as respects time and
place':.
Admitting t   his, history should most obviously follow geography., The latter science,
pursued in the spirit of the forgoing chapter,
is exactly the sort of'preparation, needed for.
its pursuit. It lays open to the pupil the
great theatre of human action, as it is; andeven introduces him to the present aetorsd
But who have been the other actors, in bygone periods? And what have been their
actions?-- ro obtain a satisfactory reply to
these queries is to study history.
To begin this, in common schools, we
should commence as with most other things
which are taught there, with the black board,
Let the teacher draw on it the mlap of the
nearest place to the school house, which includes the scene of some interesting event of
American History. If there is any such in
his: own town, so much the better. Thus a
teacher in Hartford, after drawing the outlines
or boundaries of the town might mark the
spot where the Charter Oak stands. Or one
in Charlestown, near Boston, might mark the
spot where lunker Hill stands, or one in
Plymouth, the place of the Plymouth rock.
But it will be objected, I suppose, that few
places are so distinguished as these. No,
they are not. And yet there are but few
places, where we cannot find something which
will naturally lead us back to the history of
that place. In a placewhere I was teaching199
school, in one instance--in truth not a mile
from the school house-was a spot* called
French hill, from the fact that the French
army of La Fayette once encamped there.This afforded a fine text for begiilning, upon
the history- of America. But if nothing of
this kind should exist in the town where the
school was, let a map of the county be drawn.
If this, by possibility should include nothing
striking, the boundaries of the state might be
drawn which would certainly answer the purpose,.
But suppose the worst. Suppose this little
manual should find its way to some state or
territory in which no event has ever occurred,
so striking as to attract attention, and be made
the ready key or nucleus of other events.Such a supposition which is indeed almost an
impossibility, but we will venture to make ito
Still, however,-which of us has not had an
aged friend or acquaintance who was engaged
more or less either in the war of the revolution or in that of 1812?
In the latter case we might begin by drawing a map or the boundaries of a map which,ibuld indtude:'some i pla'e:or places which or
fd    *visited'.  Thus:suppose:  one:: of my
fiends'or towinshie-n was in the Indian battle:
of Tippecanioe, where; the late President Har~
rison wonhis laurelss,:asit is so often expressed.
Let mie then draw a map of the river Wabashb
alnd its?iprincipal branches,: with perhap' the:
boid:arie of:the,'state of-Indiana; and begin
oir~ oral andl''black':-board: studies off history:i
from: th:at'point:.  Or- to' c6me nearer home,
suppose'- I have` had'relatives or' friends-some
of whom are still living-who witnessed the
exeeution of'Major Andre, a British officer of
the re'volutionarywar, at Tappan, near Hudson's river,' in the state of New York. In
that case,; draw'a map of Hudson's river, and
an outline of the'contry above New York,
between that,'" city: and Poughkeepsie, and'
having marlied the spots:: where' Andre w as'
t'aken and executed, proceed to tell the putilsabout;:him'; who he"'was; what it was for'which he was' executed; by whose orders he
was executed; the names of' some of the other
Americ'an officers, &amp;c. This would lead, perhaps,~: to cn'vesati'on:-about'them, esilciallyWashington.  A4d to co.merse, rely and
fully, about'Washington, from his birth to his
death, is to go over, in a.cursory manner,
nearly.the whole of our American history,;.for, the last, century.
-There is.no sort of difficultyin finding a
path, if we,desire it, which will lead our pupils back to the history of one of. our wars7that of -1.812, or that of 1776. And,when.,we once get them interested,in,this way, the.story of, one event' will lead us to speak of
another.event,.or of another individual who
was.concerned.vith,that e,vent; that to.opme-,thing,else; and thus on, to.the history.of our.country from,the first; and ithen to.t,hat.of
other.countries.
In all this, however, we:hae,continal
need of the black board. Let us suppose the
case of Andre, as before mentioned, and some
of the conversation:which might arise.from
it.
Having drawn our map.ofthe river Hudson,
and marked the spot where no,w stand New
SY-ork;!Pe.ekskill, Esopus, West Point, New,..Prg, and Pougheepsie, we next mark.a,pot20- 2
for Tappan. Here, we say, using our position, Andre was executed. But he was not
taken here; he was taken over there, the east
side of the river; marking that spot also.Then, again, in speaking of his object, we
should have occasion to say somethling of
West Point as it now is; its- military school,'the object of such a school, &amp;c.
Conversation on this subject, moreover,
might and would lead to say something of
Washington.  Who was Washington? When
and where was he born? When and where
did he die? At the same time, we should
find it useful to draw an outline of Virginia,
and mark the place of Washington's birth, as
well as that of Mount Vernon, the place of
his residence- and death.
And in proceeding with his history, which
is never tiresome to the young, how often
would it be useful to seize the crayon or the
chalk, and sketch an outline map of one place,
or river, or another? And more than this
even--at least if we are as familiar with
drawing as I shall show hereafter that we
ought tobe-how frequently, as we pass along,will it be both interesting and profitable to
slketch some object, natural or artificial, the
description of which is needed for explanation
or illustration?
Are the pupils, however, to be passive in
all this?  Certainly not. We cannot make
them so, if we would. One will try to draw
some place on his slate, which has been drawn
on the black board in the progress of the conversation; another will, perhaps, wish to ask
some question about the construction of a
gallows, or a fort; another will write down
or revolve, in his mind, more or less concerning the events. We should always let as
many of the sketches, maps, &amp;c. which have
been drawn at any particular lesson remain
for some time upon the black board as we
possibly can; and here is an important reason
for having at least one very large board in the
school room for general purposes.
But this repeating something which has
been drawn, upon the slate, is not all which
our pupils may be expected to do. They
may be required to write down ontheir slates,
the historScal. facts which they may hav§

the teacher, and let even those be modiﬁed to meet the
peculiarities of his own school ro-om. Hardly any miss
take could be greater than for the teacher, who should
take up a book like this,to adopt its various methods

Without reference to existing circumstances.

It is the object of the writer of the‘following work to

make it Worthy of being studied by teachers as A SYSTEM

or SLATE AND amen BOARD INSTRUCTION. Not indeed as
a complete or perfect system, for it makes no such claims.
It is a pioneer work, on the subject; and undoubtedly
contains many’ imperfections. It was ready for the
press, and its contents submitted to the Secretary of one
of our New England Boards of Education, before the
little work of Mr. Bumstead, of Boston,called “The
Black Board in the Primary School, and designed prin-
cipallyiyfor instruction how to proceed in teaching Arith-
metic” made its appearance. V l have, however, addedito

one of the closing chapters, a few thoughts suggested by

.the work of Mr. B., for which this is intended as an ac»-

knowledgrnent. The chapter on Hygiene is not found
in the ﬁrst edition of this Work; but its vast importance
will fully justify its insertion. Ne inquiring teacher
would be willing to have it omitted,

Let it not, for one moment, be imagined that I am de-
sirous of substituting slates and black boards for books

and all other implements ; or a few lessons onthese last,

heard repeated; and this, too, as far as they.may be able, in the order, as regards tim:e,:inwhich: they. took place.
For example, suppose we had told them
at one time about La Fayette, and the French
army, which he was the means of bringing
over to this country, and what battles they
were chiefly concerned in; as well as how it
happened that La Fayette and his country
were moved to come on and help us. Suppose'that at another time we had told them about
the battle at Bunker Hill, who were engaged
in it, how it originated, in what it terminated,
&amp;c, Suppose, once more, we had told them
the story of Major Andre's execution, and
General Arnold's treachery. Now would it
not be a useful exercise to requiire them to re.
late these events, on their slates- briefly of
course-.in the order in which they occurred?
This exercise would be of service in many
more points of view than one. For there
might.be pupils whose mental organization
or:whose habits were such as might.lead them
to much. inaccuracy about the order of'events,
especially wen history was taught them: in206
the manner here recommended. In writing
down what they had heard of the revolution,
it might, by possibility, read thlus; precisely
in the order in which the lessons had been
given out by the teacher.
"The American people grew tired of sustaining the war alone; they wanted men and
money. The French government accordingly
sent over General La Fayette, with men, and
money, and ships to our aid. The money and
ship s and men were all of great service to us;
the men fought for us, on several occasions,.and were subjected, on our account, to many
trials, hardships and losses.
c" At Boston, the British had almost overrun the country, as well as the city; but the
Americans, having determined to take a stand
on Bunker Hill, in Charlestown, began to fortify it. The British undertook to drive them
away, when a great battle ensued, in which,
though the British were defeated, the American general, Dr. Warren was killed. On the
spot where he fell, a monument is now being
erected, called Bunker Hill monument.
"General Arnold, who commanded thep-rhcp with fthe War, ad diatd isfiod -;with'eneial Was'hington and the govern nent,
undertook, in a wicked manner, to give up
the army and West Point to the British -troops
at New Yiork. To help atong the project,'iMajor Andre, a British: officer came out'from
)New  6tork into the neighborhood of WVest'Pint in disguise, but was taken up:'and.'con-d'emned -as a spy and executed.'  He was' takeh:at Tarrytown, on the Eastern side of Hudson's
ri'ver -and hung at Tappan, on the'Western'side, about 300 niles above New York City."
Now such an ariangem'ent o'f facts, erroneous as it is, would be perfectly natural, at least
to the thoughtless and giddy. For we must
never forget tht-'the young'a.re nter d'esti-;'itev; of cuioasity, and thereforer love to hear
stories dand grow in kno'wledge.  They are
volatile, and sometimes impatient. They are
not always willng'to take pains about the order of events,'or their remoter effects or causes.:A great deal of patience.is often needed, to

three.  In general, unless a pupil is pecuiiatly sensitive, these corrections, with the explanations'which:would onaturally accompany

This branch-may be pursued:farther or-nt
so far,:as:may seem to the teacher:most hexpedient, in his iparticalar;circumstances.--
There is, however, one'method of pursuing
it, upon which I wish to dwell somewhat
longer.
To those who have gone a little way in this
branch, either on the black board or elsewhere,
and who are familiar with Geography, exercises like the following, may be highly useful.
True they are most valuable as a review, after.2O:8
we shave studied boolks-but we have abundant proof that these slate and black board exercises do not exclude books,-but lead to their
profitable study.
The teacher will draw an outline _map of
France, and after inserting the river Seine,
and perhaps a very few other natural features
of this great empire, will put down his crayon
on Paris, and say; Do you know what city
of France stands here on the river Seine? If
they say Paris; he asks; What does history
say of Paris?  What great events have occurred here, and at what periods? &amp;c. The
questions mnay be w;-ritten, if the teacher prefers it, on the black board, and be suffered to
remain there in full view of the school, who
as fast as they are able prepare their replies
to the several questions. In other cases, immediate verbal replies only may be required.CHAPTER XIII.
BIOGRAPHY,
The importance of Biography, as a branch
of English education, seems to me undeniable.
The only debate or question connected with
it, is how amid a multiplicity of other things,
confessedly indispensable, we can by possibility find time for it. For if taught at all, it
should be taught in the common school.
Biography, however, is a branch which can
be pursued, to a greater or less extent, according to circumstances. It is not with it,
as with History or Grammar, especially the
latter, that unless studied through, as a system,
we derive from it but little benefit. Its successive portions,: are, in a great measure complete, by themselves. Thus, we may study
the life of Paul or Howard or Washington, and21I
then stop forever; and yet we do not necessarily lose what we have learned. We are
still acquainted, more or less, withi the distinguished individual w-hose life we have studied,
and though an acquaintance fobr example with
La Fayette, Fraiklin, Lee, Greene, Knox,
Adams, Hancock, and many other of his cotemporaries would make -us much more intimately acquainted with Washington himself,
-than we'should otherwise bN-, we still feel, I
sa:y'again, that'we have accomplished something. And wefeel right. Hence if we can-:not do everything:in common schools in the
way ofst-udying'biography which we wish,
every teacher may make a beginning, as well
as not.'There are always moments for this
purpose, will we but use them. But ithis I
Shall show:rrore clearly.in the chapter on
morality.
In teaching Biography, on the black board,
I would always begin with valuable characters; such for example as Paul and Iloward.
I have mentioned the names of warriors in
connection wit.h history; not because warriors
are o'ften:; good:men,'but:because it is much2;11'-sier:,to':tech- his-tory in,:ontionm   with:th:ir niin es thanwith those,of any'iotherclass
- of citizen~-s.
Let us tike the biography of Howard.Th-e:-teachei'r sketches the boundaries of'the
great empire'of European Russia.  " Here,",
heo says,,,-in the northern'part, is St. Peters
burg-; quite a large city; here inathe southern
part is the'dcty'of Cherson. Do any'of' you
know What tdi sitinguished man died ~here:? It
Was John Hwar.. What do you know rdf
John Howrd?   Was'he an American, a
Frenchman, a:Russian'ot Englishman?What washe at Cherson for? IWhere was
he going, wh   hen he went from:Moscow to
Chersonaind dlied "'there?"
I do'not mean-to intimate that many pipils
in a common school, woula be likely to answer "such questions as these; l'or it could'not:be expected.'Some few however who had
read the life of Howard, might be able to do
so. At any rate I have indicated the course
which conservation on the subject might natiualily take; and which inideed it ought to
take.212
It might be too much to go through with
his life, at a single lesson, but we may make
a beginning. We may speak of some of the
places which he visited on errands of mercy,
and sketch them in passing, on the black
board. At the next lesson, the pupils may
be questioned by way of review; on the former
lesson, and also make somewhat more familiarly acquainted with his character.
Great care I admit, is indispensable, on the
part of teachers who would teach biography,
history or geography in this way, by topics.
For not to put together our topics, afterward,
is sometimes to confuse if not confound oulr
pupils. Still, with pains and ingenuity, there
is, I think, no insurmountable difficulty.
We may begin at the close of a man's life,
as in this case of Howard, and then go back
to his birth, and go through with it regularly; or we may begin with some interesting
fact respecting him, and go backward and forward both. The only real difficulty is in
making the pupil understand where we are and
what we are about, at all times. So in teaching history; we may begin the history of theUnited States with Washington and the revolution, and run backward and forward, till
we have completed it.
One more example of biography; that of
Paul. I have spoken of his shipwreck, under
another head, and for another purpose.,Nevertheless, taking advantage of that as an introduction, or of some other fact- with, which
it is supposed a part of the pupils may be already familiar, I would commence his life at
the same place, and go backward and forward,
according to convenience, till I had complet*
ed it.
The teacher might make a hasty map of
the Mediterranean sea, and having made it
distinctly understood by the class what sea it
was, proceed as follows:' Here," putting down his crayon, near the
island of Malta, "about 1800 years ago, a
vessel being wrecked on the rocky coast of
this island, the crew and passengers, consisting in the whole of about 270 persons-one...,.'....., I,.....;,........
of them an old man of fourscore, and others
of them probably grey headed-all got ashore
in safety; even though the sea run high and7

for hard study. Very far from it. Whatl would gladly
dois toapreplare the pupils ef our common schools for
the right use of books,and proper beneﬁts of study.--
But although the exercises" which have been suggested
are intended as preliminaries rather than principal things
in a course of education, I have no doubt much might be
done towards securing a thorough English education,
with nothing but the black board and slate, and a suit»
able course of oral instruction.

Should the teacher who takes up these “ Exercises,”
attend to the suggestions I have made both in this pref-
ace, and in several of the chapters, and instead of follow-

ing, mechanically, the METHODS which are pointed out,

g-attend rather to the principlesof which these exercises

are intended as illustrations, and thus be led to form his

own plan and methods, my object will be far more per-»

fectly accomplished than if he should only transfer its"

scanty exercises to the black board, and there let the
matter end. I say SCANTY exercises, for to present‘ as
many of these exercises as some might desire, or at least
as many as would sufﬁce for the Wants of the indolent
would require a volume of immense size; such as few
teachers would buy, were it ever so desirable. To pro-
mote thought and progress, has been my object; believ-
ing that we have facilities enough already among us for

the promotion of mechanism.

Let me add, in conclusion, that I shall be very. much

21.4
the vessel came to pieces suddenly, and they
had no boat. Was not such an escape remarkable?
"'Now. among these 270 persons was one
man, whom most of you already know something about, and who was one of the inostdistinguished men, in many respects, that the
world ever saw. Do any of you know his
name? And where he was going, in the vessel, when lhe was shipwrecked? And on what
island he was cast? Do you know what befell him on the island? Do you know what
become of him afterwards?"
These questions show what course the conversation would naturally take. The teacher
would speak of Paul's going to Rome-why
he went there; what befel him there, &amp;c.Then he would go back to the cause of his being sent there, which would of course lead to
a great many more particulars of his history.
Something more might now be said of the
voyage, the places they passed, &amp;c., &amp;c.This would lead, very naturally, to a word
about Tarsus, the place of Paul's nativity;
and this again to his early life, conversion,214.
first preaehing, &amp;c. In this way, by beginning in the middle of his history, and going
both forward and backward, the course would
le made interesting and intelligible, without
being formal; and in the end, by reviewing,
or questioning the pupils, might be made clear,
correct, and orderly.
Not unlike this is the Bible method of
teaching biography, and I have often thought
this might be one reason why the biography
of the Bible is so deeply engaging and so
permanently interesting. Take the case of
this very same Paul. The first we know of
him, he is a grown man, and alreadv a firy
persecutor of the young Christian church.
After his conversion, his history continues a
while, till ere long, we are carried back, incidentally, particularly in his.public speeches,
to an account of his birth and education.Again we follow him in his travels both in
Europe and Asia, over sea and over land,
till we find him sent to IRome, where for
aught we know to the contrary, after hiaving
long braved the dangers of sea and land, andmany thus narrowly, escaped dea,the,he, cme
a martyr to the cause he had advocated..Whatever,: therefore,. may be the merits or.demerits of this method oftegaching biography,
of one thing we are sure, at'any rate; that:it
is striking and interesting;,and that by means
of slates and black boards, many of the facts;are not only made more tangible, as itwere,
but for this very reason, better and longer removed than in any other way.GRAMMAt.
AdmittingiEngl!ish GIrammar to be the artof speaking'and writing the English language
correctly, it might seem'at first view, that if
a child;- by proper attention to spelling, defin.
ing, reading, writing'land'composing, could be
brought to speak and write correctly. it would'
supersede the necessity of studying Grammar'
as'' a separate branch, and save many months,
if not years of valuable time.'Now I have not the least doubt' that a course
of instruction, like the foregoing, especially'in
spelling; defining;'reading and composing. followed up by sucll book instruction as the slate
can only make preparation for, would render
many- pupils better grammarians" than our
youth -are usually found to be. And yet I
~sin%:~i9~i~3~~-: ~t~'I'Al218
think that the direct study of Grammar subsequently to the course of instruction to which I
have referred, but not before it, may have its
uses. I think that if those who attend to it
should not read and speak any better on account of it, they would, at least, read and
speak more intelligibly, both to themselves
and others,
It is on this belief, and not solely with
reference to the public, prejudice in favor of
Grammar, that I am disposed to give special
attention to it, as a distinct branch. I know
it is generally esteemed by our pupils as an
exceedingly dry and irksome study; but it
need not be so. It may be made as interesting to the young of every age, as almost
any thing else. The only thing required is
to render it as intelligible, and I might say as
tangible as other studies.
Now I claim that the slate and black boards
give to the study of Grammar, as they do to
several other common school studies, a good
degree of whatI have here called tangibility.
They certainly have done in my own hands;2'19
and I doubt not they may in the hands of
othlers.
WVhat, then, is the course of instruction in
English Grammiar, which should be pursued
in connection with the slate and black board?
We should begin by requiring our pupils
to write down on their slates, the names of
substantial things, or in other words nouns;
but without telling them at first, for what
purpose. One of the exercises under the head
of I Spelling," in which words are arranged
in classes or natural families, is a kind of
preparation for this part of Grammar to
which we are now directing our attention.
The pupils should be made to understand,
-not merely told it,-that the words which
they are writing down must all be such words
as will either mean something when standing
by themselves, or with a, an or the, placed
before them. And in order to teach them
how to act according to this rule, we must
frequently bring words to this test on the
black board. Thus suppose a pupil writes
down the- word sour under the erroneous
belief that it means something. The teachermay then write it on the black board, and
then say, (" now is there any such thing:as a
sour?  We may indeed say a sour apple or
sour vinegar, and sour looks, but is there any
such thing as a sour, without putting some
other word with it? Think now whether it
has any sense without something put before
or after it',"
In this way, that is in bringing words to
the test, on the black board, may a teacher
soon show his pupils what he means.-There
will be very little' difficulty with what- are
called proper nouns, or with the far greater
proportion of all others6  Still there is a class
which it will be more difficult toget along
with; chiefly, however, because their meaning
is not understoodb I refer to such words as
Ingeniousness, correspondence, susceptibility,
&amp;c., expressive of qualities, and yet reta;ning
the cllaracter of substantive words. But it is
hardly reascnable to expect the pupil to understand this matter thoroughly:at first.
We need not be in haste about telling him
that he is now engagod in the study of EtyP
mology, a part of English Grammar.  It is221
in fact, of no consequence whether he knows
for some. time to come that he is studying
Grammar. Nor need he ever know, till he
has been quite familiar with their nature, the
names, noun and substantive, as applied to
this class of words. The character of the
thing should first become familiar to him, and
afterwards we may give him its name.
Next to the noun, we should study the adjective;, but not under the name of adjective;
this for a time should be withheld.  We
should write some common noun on the black
board, very conspicuously, and require our
pupils to write, on their slates a list of such
words, as when placed before it would make
sense with it. For example, the word horse
might be placed before them thus:
horse.
CThe question now is," the teacher will
say, c "what words are you acquainted with
which, when placed before horse, will make
sense with it. Perhaps you will write walk;
but can we say a walk horse?  Or you may
possibly write down' John or Thoma s; butt
10222
can we say.a John horse, or a Thomas horse?
We may indeed say John's horse, but not
John horse. But if you write the words red
or white or black, these will make sense with
horse; for we can say a white horse, or a
black horse, or a red horse.  There is a very
great number of words of this class, and if no
one pupil should be able to think of but a few,
yet among them all they would, at least with a,
very little prompting, be able to make out a
much' lairger number, For the benefit of
those teachers who have thought but little on
this subject, I will here insert a list of such
adjectives as will make sense--and good sense,
too,-with the substantive word horse.
red      kind       hornely      slow
white    gentle     agreeable    ungovernable
grey     ugly       disagreeable unmanageable
black    cross      old          unruly
pied     obedient   young        wild
good     healthy    small        gay
bad      sickly     large        headstrong
vicious  landsome   swift
It may not be amiss to remind the teacher
of what perhaps may have already forced itself upon his mind, that in almost every one
of these exercises in grammar, the pupil is223
making improvement in spelling, defining,
composing and thinking, So that were the
study of words, and the cultivation ofthought,
the improvement of judgment and the, consequent growth and expansion of the mental
powers, as a whole, the main, if not sole, object of this form of study, it would be worth
our attention and would be beyond the possibility of debate, exceedingly valuable.
But to return to the adjective. Anything
beyond the mere definition of the adjective,
in its simplest form, should not, at first, be
attempted, lest we confound and perplex,
rather than  enlighten, and improve.---
Every thing in regard to the comparison of
this part of speech, and all doubtful words-=
words I mean which lie on the confines bee
tween the adjective and the noun on the one
hand, and the adjective and the adverb on the
other should, as far as possible, be studiously
avoided.
It will be time enough, in this case, as in
the former, to give out the name ADJECTIVE,
after we have taught the thing6  Let this re3

disappointed if the ‘same instruments and methods which

‘might effect a. revolution in our common schools, should

be found useless in families. On the contrary, I believe
they are even more valuable in the family than anywhere
else. The truth is, that the family and the improvement

and elevation of the family and the schools, can hardly

mark suffice also for the other parts of speech
as well as the noun and adjective.
Before proceeding to the study of another
part Qf speech, however, it will be well to exercise the pupil in combining the adjective
and noun, as well as in framing them both
into sentences. For this purpose blank sentences, not unlike the following, may be prepared on the black board.
A               man,
The               house.
A               tree.
An               book.
horses.
Snow is
Grass is
Life is
The sun is
The               line.
These blanks the pupils should be required
to fill out. The exercise, of course, will not
be wholly new; but so much the better. It
will impress more deeply on the mind the nature and power of an acldjective;,and shotuld') 0 -
the teacher choose to give them the' name
adjective, it will be long remembered.
The next step may be to teach something
about the verb; beginning, of course, with
the verb active or transitive. The superiority
of the method ot teaching by means of the
black board, especially when we are aided by
sensible objects, is no where more obvious
than at this point. Many of our pupils spend
weeks and months in committing to memory
and reciting "a verb is -a word which signifies
to be, to do, and to suffer," &amp;c. &amp;c., without
knowing any more about the true nature of
a verb thalh they did before they began;
whereas with the aid of a black board and a
little ingenuity on the part of the teacher, a
tolerably correct idea of a verb may be obtained in a very short time.
But how are we to proceed in the question.
With a bough from some tree or shrub in his
hand, the teacher takes his station at the
black board, and with a faithful pupil at his
side, one whom he has already partially instructed, he commences performing a series of
actions which the pupil or monitor writes226
do7wn on the black board; the rest, in the
meantime, looking on and writing the actions
on their slates, or copying them from the black
board.
The teacher may bend, swing, cut, break,
saw, hack, scrape, wring, snap, strike, bite,
top, split, peel and throw the stick. The assistant pupil will accordingly write down
the words I have mentioned as fast as the
teacher performs the actions.
This assistant pupil will hardly be needed
any longer than while the school generally is
finding out the teacher's meaning. For many
will not, at first, understand him. who after a
little aid in the way adverted to, will be among
his very best students, in this hitherto dry
and much dreaded department.
But other actions may be performed, as
well as those above-mentioned. The teacher
will, perhaps, whisper, halloo, sing, read,
write, walk, run, leap, jump, hop, stamp,
crouch, sit, rise, recline, frown, smile, &amp;c.Not that all these are transitive verbs; for
many of them are not; but they are all verbs227
which imply action, and will serve to give the
idea of what a verb is.
Being told that these words were verbs,
after they have found out their naturepupils are now prepared to go upon the adverb. The teacher after writing down a verb
on the black board, asks the pupils for such
adverbs as may be joined to it.
He writes, for example, the word run, and
asks his pupils to tell how a person may run.
Few of them may understand him at first,
but with a little familiar explanation they
till soon comprehend his meaning, and will
begin to hold up their hands, to signify that
they wish to mention words.
One will propose the word slowly; another
swiftly; another, lazily; another, awkwardly,
or gracefully - and another, violently. There
will be a little difficulty here, I know, about
the ly; some omitting, and others using it.
But this can easily be set right; in fact, this
exercise is the very best in the world for eradicating this almost universal error of confounding the adverb with the adjective.
But the stick or bough, so useful in teaching228
the definition of the verb will be of great use
in giving the pupil a correct idea of the nature of an adverb. Holding it up in view of
the class,.the teacher may say; How many
ways are there of throwing this bough?
For example, it may be thrown
up
down
forward
backward
sideways
swiftly
slowly
high
far
violently
hastily
leisurely, &amp;c.
Not that one pupil in ten, even of the older
and more ingenious, could be led to suggest
all these modes of throwing the stick, or quali
ties of action; but among them all, nearly all
these, and perhaps some not included in tbis
list, might be thought of. The principal ob22.q
ject, at first, would be, to impress deeply on
their minds the idea that an adverb is added
to verbs, in some way to qualify themn; and
this by a few exercises like the foregoing
could not fail to be the result.
There are, it is true, some classes of adverbs
that can best be learned by committing them
to memory; but even in this, it would greatly
help the pupil to retain them, by copying
them from the black Loard and neatly writing
them on his slate. Such, for example, are
secondly, thirdly, fourthly, fifthly, and so on.
A correct idea of the nature of a pronoun
may be given by writing down, on the black
board, some anecdote; omitting at first the
pronouns and requiring the pupils to supply
them. Thus if an andecdote of the elephant
were to be written down, we might write it
as follows:
" A painter, being desirous of drawing an
elephant in the uncommon attitude, of having
trunk raised high in the air, and
mouth open, employed   boy to amuse the
animal and keep     in the desired attitude
by throwinrg fruit into  mouth. But as
10230
the lad frequently deceived  and made an
offer only of throwing  the fruit  grew
angry; and as if    had known that the
painter's intention of drawing  was the
cause of the affront that had been offered
instead of revenging himself on the lad
returned       resentment on the master, and
taking up a quantity of water in  trunk,
threw on the paper on which the painter was
drawing and spoiled."
This being written out very plainly on the
black board and copied by the pupils, could,
by most, be easily corrected. After the repetition of a few lessons of this kind, another
step would be necessary. They should not
only be required to supply the appropriate
words, but also to tell what they stand for.
In this view they should be directed to set
down, for once, not the pronouns, but the
words which they wculd use if there were
none such as he his, him, it, &amp;c. to be had.
Thus, in the foregoing example, the class
might be asked, in order to set them going
right, "What was it which was to be raised
high in the air and kept there?"  The elephant's trunk, they would probaby reply.
"Then write down the word trunk," would
be the proper direction. c"Keep whose mouth
open?" the teacher asks: The elephant's.
"'Then write the word elephant's."
When the blanks are thus filled out, let the
teacher read the anecdote, as thus prepared,
it will afford the pupils much amusement, and
at the sarme time give them a better idea of
the true nature of a pronoun-which is, indeed, its chief object-than could be obtained
by the mere recital of tlhe sentence c" A Pronoun is a word used instead of a noun," &amp;c.
for a whole year.
As for a description *of the Prepositions,
Conjunctions and Interjections, I think this is
best given when we come to use them in composition, and especially when we come to analyze our sentences, or, as it is called parse
them. It may be well to write off a list of
each on the black board, and let the pupils
copy them, and give them their names; not
that they: will fully understand them, but to
prepare them, in part, for further exercises.
Or if the teacher chooses entirely to omit them,23~2
for the present', there can be no possible ob~
jection to it.
It will now be timne to go back, and give
the pupils a little knowledge of the various
forms, declinations, &amp;c., of the various parts
of speech.  And first of the number of nouns.
This is managed, very easily, on the black
board. The teacher has only to write down
a list of common nouns, both in the singular
and plural form, and ask them what makes
the differences in the two columns of words.
Thus:
house        houses
book         books
tree         trees
hand         hands
sun          suns
star         stars
lamp         lamps
eye          eyes
ear          ears
head         heads
"Think now," he says, ", in what the word
houses, differs from the word house."  It will
not be at all difficult for them to perceive that
the only difference consists in the addition of2 33
an s. When it is clearly perceived that this
is the only difference throughout, it will be
proper to tell them that the words without the
s, meaning but one, they are in the singular
number; and the others meaning more things
than one, in the plural number.
But it will be well to go a little farther and
show them by familiar examples that though
this is the general method of forming plural
from singular nouns, yet that there are several other methods, some of which apply to
a very large number of words.
Examples of what we mean by the gender
of nouns, may also be presented on the black
board; together with illustrations of case and
person. Case is the most difficult of all; and
yet even this may be made more intelligible
by means of the black boa,rd than in any other
manner.
What we mean by the comparison of adjectives is better shown in this way than in
any other. If the eye assists the ear--as I
have all along taken for granted-the more
largely we address the eye the better.
And when we come to the nunmber, gender,CHAPTERI.

PRELIMINARY REMARKS.

A black board, inevery school house, is as
ilndispensably necessary as a stove orﬁre-=
place; -and in very large schools several of
them might be useful. Theyshould, ingen-
era1.,;be suspended on the -Wall, near the
teacher’s desk or platform, so as to be, like
thelatter, infull View of the Whole school.
Of course they ought to be made moveable,
that they maybe hungup in any part of the
house ‘convenient. And though the largest
may be six or eight feet long, and half as
broad-———and indeed the larger the better-r-—it
is certainly a convenience to haye one or two
so small and so light that they can beheld
in the arms like a slate. '

Now the Word, black board need not awaken
in our minds the thought of any thing difﬁ-

case, &amp;c., of pronouns, we again derive muchl
aid fromn a full exhibition of the different
forms and terminations of this part of speech,
to the whole class. A good deal of explanation is, indeed, still necessary; but the explanations themselves are vastly more important when the eye is addressed at the same
time.
Nothing, perhaps, which belongs to the etymological part of grammar, as grammar is
now usually taught in our schools, is more dry
and uninteresting than the conjugation of the
verb, and the declension of nouns and pronouns; especially the former. And yet there
are few things that can be more readily made
intelligible, not to say interesting, by means
of slates and black boards than the conjugation of a verb through its various moods and
tenses.
Nor is the black board wholly useless when
we come to Syntactical grammar, or parsing.
For besides the convenience of having the
rule or rules, most important to be kept in
mind at any given time, constantly before the
pupils, in large letters, there are a thousand2 3 5)
little devices which may be resorted to, with
the chalk and pencil, for making a thing intelligible, which cannot be practiced in other
circumstances. Let me present a few specimens of what I am now speaking of.
Suppose it is desired to show how " active
verbs govern the objective case." We accordingly write, on the black board, " Washington defended his country." Here, in order
to make a strong impression on the youthful
mind, we may draw a curved line from the
governing word to the word which is governed;
or at least require a pupil to do it, in view of
the rest. Take, for example, the sentence
already mentioned.
Wasington defended his country.
Or, to make the impression still stronger,
we may place the governed word below the
line of the rest, implying as it were, a sort of
submission. Thus,
Washington defended his  J
country.
Again, in endeavoring to make plain therule, "' The nominative case governs the
verb," we may resort to the same general
plan. I use again the same sentence as before.
Washington        j
defended his country.
Again, there is a rule in most of our grammars which says, cc Conjunctions connect the
same moods and tenses of verbs and cases of
nouns and pronouns."  Now in order to make
this rule intelligible, we may well pursue a
course not unlike the former. In the following sentences the words which the conjunctions control are conlnected together by a
curved line.
"My Fatlher taught my brother and me
to read."
"He and she were schoolmates."
"The poor are often despised and oppressed."23 7
c" To be good and to do good, should be our
main object in life."
All this, it may be said, amounts to very
little; and I freely acknowledge it. Or, at
least, I am free to acknowledge there is nothing very wonderful about it. But so much
the better. If:there is nothing wonderful or
wonderfully difficult about it, and yet if it is
really qalculated, as I maintain it is, to render
a subject which is usually regarded dry and
unintelligible, at once plain and interesting,
then trifling as they may seem in the detail
the suggestions which have been made and
the plans which have been proposed certainly
have their value, and deserve a measure of
the attention of every teacher.CHAPTER XV..
VOCAL MUSIC, OR SINGING.
Concerning music in schools, and especially
the most approved methods of teaching it witlh
the aid of the black board, I have very little
to say; chiefly, for the want of experience.
I only know that most of our distinguished
teachers, who have called in this instrument
to their aid, place a high value upon it, and
are continually found using it. How can it
be otherwise than useful, then, in common
schools, in which the public opinion is fast
deciding that singing shall be taught?
There are two considerations which weigh
much, with me, in the decision of this question. First; it seems to me obvious that inll
order to have the young understand music,
thoroughly and practically, they must be able239
to read it, if not to write it. Secondly, that
a single black board would answer the purposes of both teacher and pupils, nearly as well
-especially in conjunction with slates-as
books on the subject, with paper, pen and ink;
besides being vastly less expensive.
Much as I value music, in our schools, on
account of its physical, social, and moral tendencies, I do not believe any instrumentalities are necessary but those to which I have
alluded. I take for granted, however, that
the teacher is duly qualified for his task; for
otherwise very little can be done-whether
the instrumentalities be of one kind or another.
Whether it is, or is not, true that he "who
has no music in his soul is fit for treason,"
one thing I am sure of, that he who has no
music in his soul, is not fit to teach music,
even in the district school room.
1 have spoken as if I was wholly without
experience in this matter. But I am notwithoutexperience in regard to the moral influence
of music, in the common school room. I
have witnessed, with emotions of the most
exalted pleasure, its happy tendency. More240
than once have I seen a disorderly or at least
noisy school brought to order and quiet, in a
few moments, by means of singing. But as
I have already said, if singing in our schools
is of so much importance, this must certainly
enhance the value of slates and the black
board, since the voice of public opinion in
regard to their use in teaching this art, where
ever they have been tried, is without exception, decidedly in their favor.CHAPTE:R XVI Y
ON DRAWING.
The formation of geometrical lines of the
figures used in writing, and of many of the
letters of the alphabet, while it is a part of
the instruction which belongs to those branches, respectively,, is also an important preparation, as I have already said, for that more
particular and extended and thorough cultivation of the art of drawing, which if it cannot be said to be indispensable to all, is at
least highly useful.
Were this the place for it, I might go on to
show the great importance, to people of all
classes, of knowing how to sketch such objects
as interest us, whether of nature or art. The
task would be as easy as it would be interesting. But I must take for granted that the242
reader is already convinced of its importance,
and of the necessity, even, of making it a part
of common school instruction. The question
then is, how shall it be taught; or rather
what assistance can we derivae from slates and
~black boards.
In the excellent school of Mr. Emerson,
late of Wethersfield, in Connecticut, drawing
was attended to with no little solicitude; but
I am not sure that it was made an object of
special attention at a very early period of the
course of instruction. On the contrary, judg.
ing from Mr. E's. remarks and suggestions
concerning it, I suppose that at least he would
introduce it gradually, as I have done, among
beginners in a common school. The following
is his language concerning it.
"This is not designed (that is, in his course
of teaching,) as an elegant accomplishment,
but as a useful art, or rather exercise, for important'purposes.  But very little time or
skill is requisite to delineate a picture, in the
manner proposed. By means of oil, common
writing paper may be rendered almost transparent. This ma~y be laid upon the picture,which with pen or pencil, may, in a few mlnd
tutes be very easily traced upon it. The
principal object is to take off likenesses of
persons whohave made the most distinguished
figure in history. Drawing these likenesses
will tend to produce or increase an interest
in attending to their characters. With their
looks their names will be associated, which
will render it more easy to retain and recall
them. With their looks and names, thus associated, the learner associates their actionsd
This imparts to their whole history, a clearness, distinctness, animation, and familiarity,
that otherwise, it can scareely receive.  The
likenesses may indeed be imperfect; but this
will not materially alter the happy result.--
The same method may be adopted in drawing
maps and other objects."
Now while Mr. E. justly attaches very
great importance to the art of taking off likenesses, he does not seem to me to value, so
highly as he ought, the art of delineating
other objects; since he says expressly that
with him, in his school, the former is the
principal object. In our common schools, if
24a10

cult, rare, or costly. Why it is simply a
black board. Is there any difﬁculty in paint-
ing a piece of board ‘black ? It is indeed de-
sirable to have the board planed before it is
painted, and to have it smooth and soft; but
neither in this is there any thing very diffi-
cult and mysterious. The greatest difficulty
to be encountered is that of ﬁnding a single
board wide enough; for if we use several
pieces, itrequires some little tact to frame

them together «in such a way as to have them 

answer a valuable purpose ; though even
this is not beyond the art of the mechanic.  

Many have thought it better to paint black
the whole end of the school room, inearwhich
the teacher’s desk is placed. This would
not be so agreeable, as a brighter color, nor
perhaps, so well for the eye, unless indeed
the house was exceedingly well lighted ,; ne-

vertheless it might answer some purpose.--c

A smaller portion of the wall, of suitable size,
painted black,-—-—_say six or eight feet square
of it——would, ‘in my view, be preferable. In
either case, however, one or more moveable
black boards would be necessary, for reasons

244,
not in all other schools, the latter is a much
more important object than the former; since
in practical life we have occasion to sketch
other objects either of art or nature much
oftener than persons, whether distinguished
or otherwi,se.
This is said, however, to increase the sum
total, as it were, of the value which we attach
to the art, as a whole, and not to lessen it.For if the art of taking off likenesses is only
a small part of the science and art of drawing;
and if the whole subject belongs to common
schools, where nineteen twentieths of the inhabitants of our country receive all the instruction they ever do receive out of the
family and church, how exceedingly important, as an art, must drawing be!
But to the manner, rather than the matter
of my subject. Now I have many doubts in
regard to the use of oiled paper, as an instrument of drawing in our common schools;
valuable as it may be in select or private
schools, and above all in our families. But
even if we use it, I would use the slate and
the black board at the same time. The latter245
would be an aid, greatly so, to the former.
In commencing the use of slates and pencils among very young pupils, the practice of
prpresenting living objects, as dogs, horses,
birds, and men, was alluded to. Now children are very fond of this exercise. In commencing, in good earnest, the subject of drawing, I would therefore recur to it, somehat
in conformity with the views of Mr. Emerson;
never, however, except under the eye or directiont of the teacher, without a copy on the
black board. But I would not pursue this
plan very long. From the representations
of men and other animals, I would soon pass
to that of things.
No one, so far as I know, has done more to
introduce plain, simple, familiar drawing, into
our common schools and render it available
in the common business andc employments of
life than the late much lamented Josiah Holbrook. -Many years ago he prepared a series
of drawing cards, tlirty-six in nuinber; a set
of which, to every teacher who wishes to call
in the slate and black board to his aid, but
who feels the want of experience to guide him,
1124G
in his cause, would be invaluable.  It mnay
serve some \purpose, if I give, here, a brief
account of these cards.*
The first card is a new introduction to the
subject, by the author of the series; and contains no lines or figures.  The second contains
horizontal, vertical or perpendicular, and oblique lines. No. 3, contains angles-right,
acute, and obtuse angles.   No. 4, contains
triangles, squares, &amp;c. No. 5, circles, ellipses, curved lines, &amp;c.  Thus far he proceeds
very much in the order recommended in
Chapter II.
But with No. 6, he introduces the figures
of a cube, a cylinder, a pyramid, &amp;c.  These,
as the. reader of course knows, are, made up
from right lines, and a few curves; but then
they are arranged according to the. laws of
perspective, in regard to which the pupil will
need a little information.
It will be. well for the teacher to begin with
straight lines, and review, briefly, the: whole
course, till he comes to the formation of
cubes, cylinders and pyramids. Here,he will
*,These cards are pujlished by Willanm Marshall &amp; Co., of,Philacdelphia.247
need to dwell, till a little art is acquired, in
the formation and combination of these preliminaries.  Let him not be in haste.
The next three numbers of Mr. II. are delineations-that is mere outlines--of a mallet, a cricket or stool, and a funnel, or as it
is sometimes vulgarly called a tunnel.  They
are simply new combinations of the straight
and curved lines, already mentioned.  The
next three are representations of culinary
vessels, and are chiefly the result of varied
combinations of the curved line; such as the
figures of jars and bottles.  On these, also,
considerable attention should be bestowed, for'
the' sake of the curved lines which they involve.
Several of the next numbers, in order, are
of the same general character with those last
mentioned. They are either the representations of culinary vessels, or of agricultural or
mechanical instruments. Among them are
the pail, bucket, lamp, candlestick, watering
pot, cork screw, saw, wood-horse, mattock,
axe, broad axe, shovel, adze, auger, sickle,
shears, curry comb, flail and pitch fork.  Let248
it not be supposed that the drawing of these
common instruments and utensils of every
day life, especially of agricultural life, is unimportant, or will prove uninteresting to the
pupil-for the reverse will be found more
true.
While the teacher is setting his copies of
these vessels and instruments, he will also do
well to describe, more or less fully, their uses,
their abuses, their excellencies and their defects. A vast amount of useful instruction
may thus be given, which our pupils at school,
very seldom acquire; and without the least
Ihindrance to the main pursuit.
Or what is better still, perhaps, the teacher
may introduce the whole subject of drawing,
by merely sketqhing some one or more of
these objects on the black board, letting it
stand there, and then requiring the pupils to
write, on their slates, what they know about
thb object; its properties, uses, abuses, &amp;c.After a series of lessons of this sort, it may
be well to proceed as above. Strange would
it be, if some of the pupils have not already
tried their skill at drawing the object, before249
it comes. to be. required of them. A coarse
outline of a dog, for example, will hardly be
in full. view of pupils with slates in their
hands all day, without some of them trying
to see what they can do in the way of imitation, &amp;c. They cannot draw, theywould perhaps say, and would be loth to try; and yet
in these. circumstances which I have named,
without the interposition oftask work-rather
as I might perhaps say by stealth--many of
them will be surprised at their own success;
and not only surprised, but delighted with it.,
But the intelligent and ingenious teacher
will not confine himself wholly to these particular objects, He will draw other vessels
and instruments, in great numbers-the inkstand and pen, the table, the slate and the
black board itself. He will also occasionally
recur,.for variety's sake, (should the recurrence be: necessary in order to keep up the
pupils interest,) to the drawing of persons,
houses, animals, &amp;c.
No. 27 and 28, of the series I have mentioned, are an introduction to the drawing of
vegetables-an oak leaf, an acorn and a bough.250
Still, the drawings are mere outlines, and are
intended to be so. They should be extended
to the trunks as well as limbs!of trees; and
into flower, and fruits of various kinds, and
various. sizes.
To the vegetables, succeed some of the animals-the bird, the snail, (including the
shell,) the butterfly, the fish, the snake, the
dog, and the horse; and finally, man. On
each of these considerable time should be expended, and many anecdotes or illustrations
given.
I have insisted, all along, on the importance
of being thorough in everything; because the
tendency, in common schools, is always the
other way-to superficiality. And yet I am
aware, that strictly speaking we have no time,
in these schools, for perfection in anythingscience or art. All we aim at, is to give our.
pupils the mere elements, or as it were keys
of knowledge. Nor can in truth the most
liberal course of education do more. He who
would be a thorough student in anything
must give up to it some of the years of his
more mature life.1
[lhe subject of the preceding chapter is now receiving much attention from
the friends of public schools. In the Franklin School, Boston. instruction ill
this branch was given gratuitously during the winter of 1838-9, by a lady, to
a class of fifty pupils, with such results, that it has led to its introduction in
to otherschools. The same lady in 1841-2, was giving instruction to a class
composed of all the teachers of the Primary Schools, nearly one hundred in
all. The details of her mode of teaching is given in " A Method of T'eaching
Linear Drawing," published by E. P. Peabody, Boston.
The' Primner of Reading and Drawing" by Mary T. Peabody, contains
some excellent exercises in drawing, a few of which are appended to this vol -
hnie, with the permission of the author. The Primer is an admirable book
to assist in teaching children the first steps in reading.]
[The following chapter, on Book Keeping, was prepared by Mr. Ilarris, the.
author of an excellent and popular treatise on this subject. Mr, hIarris has
recently prepared an edition for the use of common schools lCHAPTER XVII.
BOOK KEEPING.
An accountant competent to record the business of a large mercantile establishment,
should be an elegant and quick penman, expeditious and accurate in computations, familiar with mercantile forms, and having some
acquaintance with the business which he is to
record. To compass these qualifications, requires much time, and a practice similar to
that of the counting room. It is, however, in
the power of almost every school boy, with
one winter's study, to obtain such a knowledge of simple book-keeping, &amp;c. as may be
highly useful to him in the ordinary business
of life. Every boy should know how to use
practically the Day Book and Ledger, should
be able readily to write an order, due bill, re253
ceipt, promissory note, &amp;c. Now, nine tenths
of the young men who leave school to engage
in business, are not only ignorant of any mode
of keeping accounts, but of forms of receipts,
&amp;c., which necessarily come into the business
of the mere day laborer. If this evil couldnot be abated we would bear it, but it can be,
and can be done in our district schools and no
where else; and I shall dfer a few-suggestions
on the best mode Of teaching book keeping in
these schools.- The practice, in some of our
schools, of using blank books:on which to copy
forms,- is!a good one; but in most schools it
is impracticable, and the slate and black board
must be substituted.  To make any good
degree of progress, classes should be formed,
and the members of them be furnished with
suitable text books, from which lessons should
be given, and recited. At the time of the
recitation or previously, such forms as are involved in the lesson, should be written on
the black board; which forms ishould be copied by each member of the class on to his
slate.
The first lessons should include the forms
116~11

which will appear in the progress of these
exercises. , V  

Slatesiare as necessary as black boards, and
even more so. But they are so liable to be

may seem a little costly at first; but if it
were left to  choice to furnish a school

ment, I should not hesitate on account of the
expense to furnish the latter.

254
-of orders, due bills, receipts, invoices, promissory notes, &amp;c., for all who do, and many who
do not keep a set of books, have use for these.
The peculiarities in these different forms, why
one form of a receipt is given sometimes
rather than another, the rules and laws which
regulate them, &amp;c. should be explained by the
teacher at the recitation. These forms, in all
their varieties should be cop'ed and studied,
till they can be written and repeated readily
by the- class. After a familiarity is acquired
in the form of bills of goods or invoices, the
class should be well drilled in carrying out
the prices.
Form third, and similar ones, should be
written on the black board, which should be
copied on to slates, prices. carried out and answers.composed. Then should follow examples
of Dr. and Cr., with individuals as they ordinarily appear on the Day Book, or Day Book
and Ledger. Several examples similar to the
account with J. Pratt, may be written on the
black board, slates, &amp;c.
For the form of Day Book and Ledger, reference must be had to the text book, which255
should lead the class along to an important
knowledge of the subject. The tdacher will
find it interesting and profitable to the class,
to give them some lessons which involve the
principles of double entry. Whether it would
be advisable to pursue such lessons to any
great extent, must be left to the discretion of
the: teacher, as well as other things of which
I cannot here speak. The following forms
may be used according to the directions given,
or others may be selected from the text book,
or made up by the class and teacher.

MISCELLANEOUS INSTRUCTIONS.
There are many things which teachers
think it important to inculcate in school which
can hardly be classed under either of the foregoing hea,ds, although they have an important
relation to the subjects of several of them.Such are, the sounds of the letters, or the elements of English utterance; a knowledge of
the powers used in composition; the use of some
of the abbreviations; the use of numeral letters,
&amp;c.
There are several ways of teaching English
utterance.  One way--perhaps among the
best-is that which I am about to mention,
involving the free use of the black board.
Suppose the teacher wishes to present to
his pupils the various sounds of the letter c,262
After assuring themethat it has two sounds, its
natural soft sound on that of s, and its unnatural or bad sound, on that of k, he thus illustrates the difference on the black board; requiring them to copy the whole directly upon
their slates.
k.  s.            k.       s.
cake cent        (ca) cake (ce) cent
coal city        (co) coal (ci) city
cup cylinder     (cu) cup (cy)cylinder
The teacher need not prefix the ca, ce, &amp;c.
to'the words, till he has shown his pupils by
repeated and nnmerous examples that this is
the universal' rule; after which it is useful to
prefix- them and require the pupils to do the
same. SLupsequently to. this it may be well to
write down the rule.  cC is hard before a, o
and u; soft before e, i and y;" and leave it
standing on the slate.
The difference between this and the old
method of teaching the same thing, is that it
was formerly customary to commit the rule to
memory; in the first place whether the thing
itself was understood or not; whereas, with
the aid of.the black board, &amp;c. teach the thing
itself first, and the rule afterward,2633This single example may suffice, as an-illustration of the method proposed of teaching
the sounds of the letters by the aid; of slates
and black boards. A thousand other-illustrations might be added, but they would be mere
repetitions of this.
To teach the pauses in composition, we
have simply to write them and apply them
on the black board, according to their respective uses. For my own part, I never care to
teach children the use of them at all, except
in connection with composition, as I have already stated at the close of. the chapter on
that subject. Still'as many teachers prefer
to have their pupils commit them to memory,
or at~ least understand that they require a
suspension of utterance for a longer or shorter
period, it may be well to devote a few moments to that subject.
Let a plain English sentence, then, not
unlike the following, be written down, in large
staring letters, on the black board.
Samuel, bring your book to me; I wish to hear
you read.
Here I would say, are three of the more12"

moral and physical cha,raote=r of the pupils he
properly attended to, Without furnishing the
ehildren with ample enjoyment; and I repeat
it, I know of no Way of employing them so
‘well as by means f slates and pencils. On

this subject, moreover, I speak from eonsid-~

erable experience.   .

But are not books nec‘esssa,ry at all, when
the pupils are furnished with slate’! I may
be asked, Not for at large proportion of
children who attend our summer schools, nor

for some of those who attend in the winter,

To such I believe hooks are not only useless,
but on the Whole, Worse than useless. As
they advance in years, however, they may
he indulged with e book, now and then, as at
favor. Such a. favor will not be esteemed a.
light thing 3 and will come in time, to be
sought more frequently, and with more and
more earnestness;

It is true We should not allow‘ the pupils
to have slates in their hands the Whole item.
Though it should be our aim to give them
eonstant employment, yet their employment
should be varied, Even the slate, if it were

264
important pauses; the comma, the semicolon
and the period. The first is the comma; you
may imitate it, on your slates. The next is
the semicolon. The third, and last, is the perod. They should write them all. ~
Next they should understand, by my own
example, that at the comma, whenever we
come to. it, in reading, we should pause long
enough'to say distinctly one; at the semicoIon, long enough to say one, two; and at the
period, long enough to say one, two, three,
four, five, six.
In a si milar way, should we proceed to teach
the use of the colon, the exclamation point,
the.in.terrogation point, the caret, the parenthesis), &amp;c..This is merely teaching them
practically, rather than theoretically; I claim
for it no merit, on account of novelty. The
only caution, I need add, is that which is always very much in point, "' Make haste; but
make haste slowly."
The abbreviations used in composition are
best.taught, in'a similar manner, on the black
board. For this purpose, as it is in the case
preceding, the black board and slates have'265
better advantange over books, except that
they save the expense of the latter, and render
the subject of study a little more tangible, as
it were, and therefore a little more practical.
Merely committing such things to memory,
doesnot answer, well, the purposes for which
it is intended. I never knew a pupil who
fully understood them, in that way. Some of
the best readers, and the most liberally educated people whom I know, say, for the following, Messrs. James Myrick &amp; Co.; Gentlemen Sirs James Myrick &amp; Co. And why is
this   Because, in the table where they committed it to their memories, the words Gentlemen, and Sirs both stand.opposite the abbreviation that the pupil may have his choice;
and as there was no direction about itj they
took both. The black board may prevent such
errors.
The numeral letters, like the pauses and
sounds of the latter-and for the very same
reasons-are best learned from- the black
board. The process need not be long. With
very little pains they are both understood and
readily retained in the memory.266
One valuable method is to make, for example, a V' in the middle of the black'board, and
after asking what it stands for, then ask the
pupils to tell -what shall be added to it to'make
it represent'six; what to make it stand for
eight, &amp;c.   So of X, XX, C, D, M, &amp;c.Another good exercise is for the teacher to
write a certain number on the black board or
the ordinary characters used in arithmetic;
say 24; and then require his pupils to write
on their slates, the numeral letters which
represent it.
Another exercise on the black board consists
in making corrections of misrepresentations.
Nothing is more common among us than to
mispronounce words.     Hundreds- perhaps I
might say thousands*-of words we almost
daily use among us are pronounced awkwardly
by many well bred people; and, by others,
entirely wrong.    A small number of these
words should be placed on the black board
daily, when it can possibly be spared, and,
* Mr. Bu.mstead in his' Spelling and Thinking,' has about 1000 such words
at the bottom of his pages; and we may be assured that his list includes but
a part of those which are current afong us, and Daniel Burgese &amp; Co.. of
New York, havejust published a work entitled'"Four'llundreld Mistakes
Corrected," &amp;c., a capital work no doubt, but I have not seen it.267
kept on it; and the pupils occasionally required to pronounce them till the error is effectually eradicated.
A similar course may be pursued with errors of expression, such as the use of double
negatives, the disagreement of the verb with
its nominative case;- the common and frequent violation of the rule "the verb to be has
the same case after it as before it," &amp;c. Also
the' usual contractions of "have not," ", are
not," &amp;c. into haint and aint. Let the teacher
write, on the black board.
have          not            haint:
-am           not            aint
shall         not           shant
And let-them stand there a few. days, and
let him occasionally drill the pupils on them,
and an impression will be made which will
never be forgotten. So of "I hain't got no
book," and "how sweetly the birds sings!"
C"It was me that did it," &amp;c. only place them
on the black board, and'place the true English expressions opposite to them, and proceed
as before; and your success, though slow, will
1be sure anad certain.268
Let me mention one thing more. I alluded to the art of subscribing a letter, directing
one to a friend, writing a note, &amp;c. How
much of awkwardness there often is in people
who ought to know better, in managing these
little things. Yet the black board and a little ingenuity and patience, might prevent it.
How easy it is to make a long square, in the
form of a letter, on the black board, and then
write within it just as we ought on the back
of a letter!-Suitable remarks might be made
on the proper way of writing one's name in
a book, &amp;c., &amp;c.
In short, there is hardly any thing, which
it is necessary for us to know, which, in its
rudiments at least, may not in this way be
inculcated; and, on the principle that what
is addressed to two senses, the eye and the
ear, is longer retained than what is addressed
to but one, be made eminently practical.U'HAPTER Xix)
MORALITY.'there are several ways of teaching morais
end religion with the aid of the blacek board.
Some of them are direct; others are indirect,
Let me begin with what I call indirect teaching.
1. Furnishing employnent to the pupilS
of our common schools, has of itself a moral
tendency. To keep children as well as grown
people occupied with that which is useful, or
even with that which is not hurtful, is one
means, among many, of keeping them out of
mischief. Hence slate and black board ino
struction, by furnishing much innocent not to
say positively valuable instruction, and by
preventing evil, has a moral tendency.
But these employments, throughout, may270
be positively useful, as well as negatively so,
The wise and benevolent teacher-he -who
not only seeks to make his pupils wiser but
also better-will often be able to give a moral
turn to his lessons in mere science. The
words andc sentences selected for various purposes-spelling, defining, reading, &amp;c.--may
be such as will slowly but surely affect the
heart. Such a tendency, more especially,
may be given to all anecdotes, andlessons on
biography and history.
2. Morality is also indirectly taught by the
habits of industry which are acquired. For
it cannot be otherwise than that the lazy
custom to which our pupils are subjected, in
being confined from hlour to hour on the school
bench, literally doing nothing--if indeed the
teacher can succeed in making them do nothing-has a tendency, so far as it goes, to make
them indolent through life. On the:other
hand, I cannot doubt that by imparting the
busy hum of industry, slate and black board
instruction has a'good tendency. I do not
of course, forget that bad men are often
highly industrious; nevertheless this does271
not militate at all against what I have said.
3. Once more. How many a time have I
seen a school become noisy, unaccountably
so, especially towards its close, in spite of all
which could be done by the best teacher.--
Now a part of this evil is justly chargeable
on a want of employment. But let a teacher,
in these trying circumstances, call the attention of the whole school to the black board.
Is there no expedient, either in all the wide
range which has been gone over in this book,
or that wider range which will be afforded by
the efforts of an ingenious teacher, which is
adapted to arrest their attention, and thus restore quiet and order? If there is not, then
I have not studied correctly the human heart,
and, above all, the character and habits of
infancy and childhood. How long would it
take a teacher to sketch, for example, the cost
of the Mediterranean sea, and say; " Here is
the rock of Gibraltar;" and so relate some anecdote about it. How long to make apicture
of a whale or a seal, or a ship, and say something respecting it, &amp;c., &amp;c.
But morality may be taught directly by the2721
aid of the black board. How many teachers
procure printed cards, containing valuable
moral rules and precepts, and hang them up
in their school rooms. How many, too, think
they have a good moral tendency, and perhaps
justly. But admitting all that is claimed for
them, the effect cannot last long; it must
soon wear out. How much more valuable
are precepts written on the black board, to
remain for a time, and then be erased, and
their place supplied by others.
Whether or not these precepts,when strictly
moral and religious, make much permanent
impresssion, there is a class of precepts which,
by helping to establish order in school, have
a good and I may say, moral tendency.
Children are, too often, forgetful of what is
told them in school, even when their general
purpose is to be obedient. Tell them to do
but one thing at a time, and they will endeavor
perhaps to conform to your wishes, as long as
they remember it; but if they forget it, in
five or ten minutes, what then will you do?
Tell them over again; do you reply? The
reply is a just one, but can you not enlist273
the black board as an aid in this businesa of
telling things over and over again? Can you
not write down your precept-rule, ratherin large letters, and let it stand there in full
view of the school, till it becomes n eedful to
substitute something else in its place?  It
could do harm to no pupil,; while it might
save much trouble with a large class of those
whose worst fault is that of forgetfulness..How many valuable rules, in manners,
morals, &amp;c., might thus be presented to the
minds of the pupils of a school, in the course
of a single quarter q One advantage which
they have over those which are printed and,
hung up in the room, is, that they do not remain long enough to become stale, before they
are removed to make room for something else.
But again; set lessons or lectures on behavior or morals, may be far better inculcated
-if teachers choose to lecture their children
at all in this way--by aid of the black board,
than without it. Let a person, for instance,
endeavor to show the influence of evil example. He writes, perhaps, on the black
board, the words of Solomon: cc One sinner

at theircommand continual1y,Wou1d become
tiresome. To sit still, at times————entirely
still———if not continued too long, is one form
0/ doing something ; and I considerit as much
a part of the teacher’ s duty to form his pupils

to the habit of sitting still, as to teach them a

spelling and reading. Not of cdurse an hour
at a time, or half an hour, or a quarter, even.
To some children, five minutes Would be long
enough; and to most, ten minutes would be
the full extent of what would be useful}. But
there are numerous other exercises which are
useful to the young, in the school room;
such as standing, marching, singing, &c. ; to
say nothing of exercises, at least every hour,
out of it.»-. p _

But having black boards and slates provi-
ded for a school, What shall be used on them
———chalk, crayons, or pencils C?

For the black board, a simple piece of chalk
will answer very Well. There is noiobjec-=
tion, however, to What are called, by some,
part crayons. These keep the chalk from the
ﬁngers, and of course from the clothes. By
port cra.g/0725,  mean tin or brass tubes, about

274
destroyeth muchgood." Now though he may
not forget his own text or motto, while
speaking, yet not a few of the pupils may
forget the text; and is it not well to have
something to recall it to their minds?
How many an adult who suffers his mind
to wander in church, during the sermon, forgets the text, and unable to get hold of the
subject of the discourse, as an aid in recalling
his attention, remains for some time, in a state
of listlessness; and loses -much of the discourse? Would not such people be greatly
aided if the text were written in large letters
on a blackboard'behind the minister? But
do childrens minds need wander less, while the
teacher is lecturing them, than those of adults
while the minister is preaching?  And would
the text, in large letters, on the blackboard, be
less useful to them than to adults? Should
we not act wisely in endeavoring to render
that which is, at best, rather dry to children,
as interesting as possible?CHAPTER XX.
HYGIENE, OR THE LAWS OF HEALTH.
Up to the beginning of the year 1832, I
knew of but one among nearly two hundred
medical men in Boston, who would not have
regarded every effort at giving to the mass of
mankind a knowledge of the structure, laws,
and uses of their bodies, as utterly futile, not
to say chimerical.  The idea even found
opposition from  the editor of the Boston
Medical and Surgical fournal-Dr.'Jt V. C.
Smith. Dr. John C. Warren was the only
individual of the medical corps, who bade me
God speed, in such an attempt. And yet,
strange to say, in ten years from that time,
the very Dr. Smith, above menticned, had,written and sent forth cc A Class Book of
Anatomy, designed for Schools."  Dr. Hay276
ward's,( Outlines of Physiology," for higher
classes in schools, appeared the same year.Still more recently, Dr. Jarvis and Dr. Lane
have written on the same subject, for the use
of schools; and I do not believe there are now
in Boston, three medical men who would risk
their reputation as the friends of science, by
an open attack on popular Hygiea.
But it is not Anatomy, nor even Physiology, properly speaking, that is needed in our
schools and families; although in their ignorance, some of our Boards of Education have
recommended them. What is wanted is a
practical knowledge of the Laws of Health,
or Hygiene; with just so mueh of Anatomy
and Physiology as may, from time to time, be
found necessary in order to their full and perfect illustration and explanation.
The laws of health are numerous; but are,
in general, simple and intelligible. It is of
little consequence which of these laws we
begin with; though -for the sake of making
the matter tangible, I often begin in a manner not unlike the following.
Standing, with the teacher's permission,277
before the school room black board, I draw a
coarse and hasty outline of the human head
and trunk, thus:
(" Now, children,"'l  I say to them,  does
this look like any thing you ever saw? Does
it look like a tree, of any kind? As many
of you as think it looks like a tree, may raise
your hands."  They look at each other and
perhaps smile, but no hands are raised.
"Does it look like a horse?"  No hands
12*278
are raised. c' Does it look like a house?"Still no hands make their appearance. "cDoes
it look like a man?" A few hands are-up.
"Yes, children," I say to them, cc it is a
coarse representation of certain parts of a man;
or rather of the house he lives in. When you
look at me, as perhaps you already know, you
only see the house I live in. You can hardly
see me. It is true you may see the windows
I look out at, (putting my hand to my eyes,
at the same time,) but the thinking and feeling part which is properly me, is out of your
sight."
By this time they have found something
else to do, besides looking at each other.--
Their attention is all absorbed in the new
ideas they are receiving from the speaker. In
these instances, I proceed to talk with them
about my little outline on the black board.
"Here, on the black board," I tell them,
you see a very small part only, of the house
we live in. You only see the outside of the
two main parts of the building-the upper and
lower stories of the house, with an umbrella
shaped partition between them-and the cu279
pola. The house has pillars to rest on, as well
as other various and important parts not here
represented; especially the covering. Then,
too, it has a vast amount of furniture within
it."
"I should like to give you, on the black
board, a picture of theframe work of the house,
complete; but it would take too long a time.
It consists of about 250 separate pieces, most
curiously fastened together. I will hang up,
in its stead, this skeleton, as it is called, of the
body. You have seen it before, it may be;
but it will do you no harm to see it again."280281
"Now I will show you a hasty picture of
the house we live in, all covered and finished.
I mean, rather, that I will show you the general appearance of the covering, before any
ornament (dress) is applied to it. Of course
it is a very imperfect representation, as I
make it in great haste. Besides, in the days
when I went to the district school, we had no
teachers who were: able to teach us how to
draw, such as you now have."282
There are few teachers in our schools at the
present day, who cannot make something of
this sort, that will at least convey the idea
they wish to express; especially with this
little book in their hands. And some might
even draw, in a hasty and coarse way, the
whole skeleton; instead of relying on a printed
diagram.
"But the house we live in," I proceed to
tell my wondering audience, " has furniture
of various kinds. Some of it is in the upper
story, as I have' called it; and some of it in
the lower story. There are also important
articles to be seen in the cupola. Here is a
faint and imperfect outline of the principal
items of furniture in the upper and lower
stories."283'
"I have marked most of the articles of
furniture, with letters, so as to describe them
to. you briefly. Thus a represents the heart,
which sometimes beats so strongly when you
are frightened, or when you have been running-and indeed you can feel it beat, more
or less strongly, at any time. Then b b are
the lungs, or breathing furniture; and c represents the passage by means of which air
gets into the lungs-called the wind-pipe.--CON TEN TS,

as large as a common crayon'.—.—~or if a little
larger itwould do no harm————with two slits
at the end, into which a piece of chalk might
be pushed, where by the elasticity of the tube,
itwould be retained with suﬂicient ﬁI‘HlH€SSs

For writing on slates, nothing is better, on
the whole, than common pencils; As they
are liable to be broken, however, the question
has been raised, whether short pieces, which
are not so readily broken, should be used, or
whether larger ones are not preferable.   My
opinion -is in favor, on the whole, of long
ones ; and for the following reasons, If the
pencil islong, and of a texture sufficiently
soft, it will not be difficult to teach the pupil
to hold it as he would a ‘pen; andthus he

wil1“be preparing to hold his pen properly

whenever he comes to write on paper. But
if the pencil is short, only an inch or two in
length, it will, in all probability, be held in
a Very conﬁned, awkward manner; and the
pupil will be unﬁtting himself to holding a
pen properly, in time to come, I know well
that the habit he acquires of contracting his
ﬁngers, around the pencil, can sometimes be

284
At d you see the stomach, or food bag. The
liver is represented by e e; the kidneys by
f f; and the intestines by g g.
This, I say, is, substantially the course of
instruction I pursue, as the beginning or preface to school room hygiene. It is moreover
such a course as is, at once, intelligible and
practicable with almost every teacher. This
is a point of very great importance. Our
teachers are not all learned men and women;
and this book is intended to aid those who
are least informed, no less than the more enlightened.
In other instances, however, I begin with
children, in our common schools, in a manner
entirely the reverse of the foregoing. Thus,
suppose it to be at the time of ripe cherries.
Taking in my hand a few cherry stones, I
present myself, as before, at the black board.
c" Children," I say to them, "; do you know
what I hold before me? As many as do, may
signify it, by raising your hands." Many
hands are raised.  "What, is it?" A cherry
stone. c' Yes. Do you know what it is good
for?"  They hesitate,  I will tell you what285
it is not good for. It is not good to eat. And
yet many people eat, or at least swallow such
things. How many of you have ever swallowed a cherry stone?  As many as are willing to confess that th-ey have, may raise their
hands. What all of you?  How is that?"
One child, perhaps, breaks the silence by
saying that some friend told him the stones ot
cherries ought to be eaten. To this I reply,
" That was once believed, I know; but the
idea is given up now. I will tell you why.
Do you know what becomes of your foodcherries and every thing else-when you
swallow it?  While you are making an effort
to swallow, it goes into a hollow tube or pipe
just behind the wind-pipe (which you can feel
at the fore part of your throats,) and after
passing downward behind the lungs about a
foot, goes into the bag, which I showed you,
just now, marked d, and called the stomach.--
This food pipe, behind the wind-pipe, is called
by the hard name of the esophagus; or sometimes the gullet. I will show you a picture
of the stomach, by itself.286
The food enters it when you swallow, at 1,
and goes out, after having undergone certain
changes, at 2. In going out, it has to ascend,
as you see, at 2. Now cherry stones have
very hard work to climb the ascent. But
suppose they succeed in getting out of the
stomach, they then have to pass on, through
a very long crooked pipe, for a distance of
very many yards, till they come to a place in
the passage where they have to climb up hill
much more than at 2, the outlet of the stomach. I will show you.the shape of this up
hill passage, commencing at u, and going on
in the line of the little arrow you see."287
" Now it has sometimes happened, that a
cherry stone having arrived at that part of
the intestines marked u, attempts to ascend,
but is unable. Or, rather, the force, in the
passage, which generally propels substances,
being, from some cause or other, insufficient,
the stone remains at the beginning of the ascent, and can neither get forward nor backward. Persons who swallow cherry stones288
sometimes have pain in this part of the body
for a long time. In a few instances the cherry
stone may escape, but it sometimes not only
remains there and keeps up irritation and pain,
but the person dies. On examination, the
cherry stone has been found coated over with
a thick crust of something like lime, so as to
form a hard, heavy mass, of the size of a hen's
egg, or even larger. Do you think a person
could live long, with a piece of limestone in
his bowels, as large as an egg?"
With the skeleton before a class, or even a
very coarse outline of it, we may give the
young a most admirable lecture on becoming
round shouldered.
Thus we may say to them: "By a careful289
examination you may feel a- bone- as long as
your finger and about as large, placed like a
brace, between the point of the shoulder, and
the top of the breast bone, as you see in the
diagram-where   1 1, represents the bones of
which I am speaking, 2 2, the shoulders and
3 3, the breast bone. These little brace
bones, are called clavicles, or collar bones.--b
They are strong, and are really intended by
the Author of Nature as braces, to keep the
shoulders back, and make us straight.."
" But while we are young and tender the
ends-of these bones, both at the shoulder and
at the breast bone, are as soft as if they were
mere gristle, So that if we sit ih a stooping
way, either at school, or elsewhere, the weight
of the body and shoulders, in pressing against
the soft ends of these bones, makes them
shorter, and allows the shoulder to come forward farther than is natural, and they remain
so. This renders.us round shouldered."
Immense is the good which I have known
in schools as the result of this simple lesson,
aided. by a diagram or two on the blackboard,
or in a printed form.290
There is however, hardly any limit to the
number of little lessons in hygiene, which are
readily and aptly illustrated by means of the
black; board. But there are also a much
greater number of practical lessons, in teaching which the black board is of very little
service; or rather in which we have it at our
option to use or not to use it. Thus, suppose I wish to show a school of little children
the folly and danger of eating green fruits,
especially green apples. "Children," I "say,
" I should like to tell you a story."
" When I was four or five years of age, a
little boy, whom I will call Thomas, sat by
my side, every day, and when the recess and
intermission came we played together. Occasionally we all ate green apples; but Thomas ate many more than the rest of us. IHe
ate so many, in fact, that his playmates and
even his teacher took particular notice of it,
and sometimes reproved him for it. One fine
morning, he was absent from school-a thing,
with him, very unusual. The next day, we
heard he was sick. The next day, he was
very sick. The third day he was dead. And,291
now, let me tell you, that almost every body
said Thomas Clark died so sadly and suddenly
because he ate so many green apples. Observe, however, that I do not say it was the
green apples alone that killed him; for many
other causes may have had influence. But
is eating green apples safe?"
To make the lesson still more striking, I
have sometimes drawn a coarse outline of the
stomach, thus:
and told the pupils how the green apples, not
being easily dissolved in the stomach, sometimes remain at its bottom where I have made
the dots, and cause irritation, and inflammation
and death. But we may do great good by
relating the simple story, without the aid of
a black board.
The young may be deterred from the habit
and consequent dangers of coming suddenly292
to the fire, when they are extremely cold. I
have known many to faint in these circum~
stanices; and in others to fall into convulsionsb
Indeed, in one instance, a stout and apparently
healthy man) in Maine, who was almost fro*
zen, went suddenly to a very hotbfire to warm
himself, and fell down dead instantly.
But I m ust not extend this chapter, and
even the last paragraph was hardly called for4
The book is already larger than was intended.
And yet I would fain hope that it will notbe
found, by inquiring teachers, too large. If it
shall afford hints to such as would gladly go
on in their noble vocation, to perfection, it is
all I can reasonably expect,15

,broken ; but it is often carried through life.
To prevent them from being pbroken, the
pencils may be Wrapped in strong paper cova»
ered with paste, Which should be well rolled
around them and dried. As the pencil Wears
away, the paper and stone may easily be cut
‘away, togetherl. r the port crayons, or han-a
dles for the chalk already mentioned, made a
little“ smaller than a, cra_yon———sa.y about the
size of acommon quill~——-may be used; in
Which case, a longer or -shorter piece of pen»
oil will serve the purpose, just as may happen
to be convenient. The pencils or crayons
should be attached to the slates loosely, by
means of strings, i In thecase of the younger
pupils, this Will save them "from being lost;
andin i that of both the older and the younger,
will prevent much confusion and noise, The
desks ofa school room should be so construc-
"tecl as to furnish a place for a slate, This,
of course, Would not prevent the teacher from
taking the slates away from them Whenever
he should deem it best, especially those of the
younger pupils, i  
Perhaps it should be added that a piece of

16

sponge to.eaeh slate, said a larger piece for
the black board--—or if not of sponge, of cloth
or Wash leather-——it is as necessary as the
slate and black board. The teacher, more—-
over, needs something for a pointing stick.

I ought also to say here, that the preceding
remarks, as Well as those which follow, are
made upon the presumption that every pupil
of every age has his own separate desk; for
I concieve this to be a highly important point,

in the construction of every school house.——-

Some, I know, undertake to say that one desk
Will serve for two pupils; and so it may,
‘When We cannot do better. But one pupil,

and one only, to each desk, however young

he may be, is certainly preferable. The ex—
pense of adding a few feet to the length and
breadth of a house, in orders to admit of a
space for separate desks, Will be more than
made up in increase of comfort and facility of
progress to the pupils.» These desks, more»
over, should be at a considerable distance
from each other. The reasons are obvious to
the teacher. It is better to prevent evil,
when We can, than to attempt to cure it.

~CHAPTER ll.

:—.-2-:-1:--—:—

ronmme LINES, creams, &c,

At first, it will be Well for the small por’-s
tion of each day in which very young pupils
are allowed to have slates, to let them use
them much in the Way they please. Some
Will make one thing, some another. What
they make is of comparatively little conse-
quence, provided they attend, each to his
own business, and do not interfere with that
of others, i 

iWhen a pupil has become somewhat fa-=
miliar With the slate and pencil, he Will es-
teem it a favor to be permitted to have a copy
or lesson, and do something. ' Let him,‘then,
have his lesson 3 and if there are others, so as
to form a little class, so much the better.

The teacher may be the leader of the class,
or he may employ an elder pupil for the pure

18

pose. . in the outset, however, I like to have
the Wisdom of the teacher put into requisition,
as much as may be; assistants or monitors
will do better afterward.

One of the first exercises should be that of
making mere lines, parallel to each other, or
vertical. 1 have thought that vertical lines
Were most readily made; N ct that I would
insist, at once, on an exact perpendicular to

the line formed by the bottom of the slate or

black board, butisomething as nearly approx-ab
imating to this position as could reasonably
be expected, They should have a copy on

the black board, thus ;   c s F

These I would teach them to make of dif-
ferent lengths and at differing distances ; and
even in greater or less numbers. The teacher
may have mm'ez‘_2/in the lessons, by merely
‘Varying, the number of the marks. After



Writing these a, few days, I would present to

them a lesson of horizontals, to be copied, in

liked manner, on their slates, thus: o

*4

A perpeiidictilar and horizontal line might
then be drawn together thus : s

l

 

‘No tea‘che‘r should expect too much of 3,
young pupil, at first. His efforts Will often
be Very rude; there will hardly be the slighte-
estiresemblance between the copy and the

original, Yet if there should he 1na.nifested d

but the slightest desire to i1nita,te the copy,
the teacher should endeavor to wait patiently

20

For the results. If a pupil is in earnest he
will do something. If not, it will be easy to
refuse him the use of his slate. .

Next, two horizontal and two Vertical lines
may be united to form a square, and this may
he a lesson for the pupil, for a day or at least
halfa day. Here is the lesson, except that
for the sake of‘ distinotneiss, ll Would have it
much larger than this, on the lolael: board;
and much larger there than I expected the
pupils Would have it on their slates; since
their eye, at ﬁrst, cannot be supposed sufﬁ-T»
oiently trained to enable them to make allow-s
ance for the difference in size made by dis-s
tance,

The parallelogram, or long square, is next;
and may be of difl‘erent"’proportion and size,

21

ratidifferent lessons. A For I hardly need to say
that in forming these squares the pupil is still
perfecting himself in the art of making per-—

pendiculars or Verticals, and horizontals.

i Oblique lines should next come in order, of
which the following may be a specimen.

  \\\\\\\ \\\\

In another lesson the slope may be reversed,
as in the following exampg.

///”/”/’//W/’  

These lessons being made sufficiently fa-

, miliar, together with the parallelogram or

long square, the pupil should proceedito com-
bine the vertical and horizontal lines with

  oblique ones, to form triangles. Let me here

say, however, that I would not give the names

9 ‘)

-J-sJ

of these various lines and ﬁgures at ﬁrst, at

least asa part of the lesson. - I would occa-

sionally call them by their proper names, (as
if Without any particular int-ention,) but Would
not at first require them to remember‘ them.

Here are some of the Various triangles

which I would present them for imitation,
one at a time, beginning with those on the

‘left hand.

 

Every intelligent teacher will see‘ the reas-
on tor preferring the order above, as Well as
the propriety of placing but one of the trian-

ggles on the black board, for imitation, at a

time. ~

23.

’ But We ought not to be tedious With young
pupils at ﬁrst. Whenever We ﬁnd their at-
tention beginning to waver, to any consider-
able extent, instead of insisting on their going
on, from lesson to lesson, in this precise order,
We should for a time substitute something
else. Let them tryto make the picture of a
horse, or a dog, or a man, or of any thing
else. But‘ even in this case I should prefer

to have a copy of the object which is to be

imitated,placed on the black board.

One caution here may be necessary. It

may not beadvisable to exhibit .to a Whole
school, on the larger black board, What only
concerns a very few small pupils.   I would
here, therefore, at all events, employ an as-
sistant or monitor; and having set the copy,
on a smaller black board or slate, would re-
quire it to be held at a little distance before
them. 1

It has been said, in a preceding paragraph
that the teacher, should not, at first, give out
thenames of the various lines, ﬁgures, &c.,
which the pupils were required to make.--.-

24

The reason for this is that it will only tend
to confound or perplex them. One thing at
a time should be our rule, as much as the cira
cumstances may admit. But as soon as the
lines and ﬁgures themselves become familiar,
and the pupil is somewhat expert at making

them, itlwill be Well to teach him names. It

may be done With advantage in the following
manner.

Standing by the black board, With his chalk
in his hand, the teacher observes : Now, my

  scholars, I am to make some vertical lines,

on the blackboard. How shall I makethem '2

Is this right ?I at the same time making some a

which are either horizontal or oblique. N 0,
No ; say several voices. “How then ? Is
it so ?” making another Wrong one. No.
“Is it so, then '2” at the same time making
the line. as it ought to be. Yes.

Allow me, here, to make two remarks.--—

One is, that it will be better, in many respects, V

to habituate the pupils, from the ﬁrst, to sig-
nily their assent or dissent, their yes or no,
by raising their hands. Such a practice will

25

be especially, necessary in a course of slate
and black board instruction; for it will both

save much time, and prevent much disorder. a

T The other remark to he made is, that not
a few teachers in pursuing this negative mode
of instruction, both deceive themselves and
defeat their own purposes. They Wish to

compel their pupils to think ; Whereas, in

fact, they prevent their thinking.

Take, for example, the case above-. The
teacher, on proposing to make a vertical line,
makes at ﬁrst an oblique one, and then asks

them to raise their hands, if they think it is

right. No hands are raised. He then makes
aihorizontalline, and asks; , “Is that right?”
They signify it is not. t Then making a ver-
tical line, he says, “ Is that right?” in a tone
of voice and with a manner, especially with
an emphasis, which as fully convinces the pn-
pils that he has now made the true line, as it he

‘ had said so, in plain Words. I have often been
astonished at the extent to Which teachers

decieve themselves, in this Way. Without

intending to tell the pupils that they have

26

now done the real thing proposed, they cer«
tainly do tell them by their motions, their
tones, or their emphasis ; and no pupil who
is attending to What they say, Will mistake
them.

But there is another common form of mis-
take. Many fall into the habit of asking   a
certain number of questions, say one or two
or three, before they come to the right.--—
Thus, in the case above, they would make
one Wrong mark, and the next, each pupil
would know to be the right, because it Was
the _teacher’s uniform habit to refer to the

right at the second question. In a thousand
Ways—-—certain1y in very many——-do teachers

fall intohabits which defeat their own pur-

poses. It may be, too, that the pupils are

sometimes deceived as Well as the teacher ;
mistaking that for. their oWn—something
which their own minds have originated-‘-

which, in effect, they receive from the teacher,

and is a mere echo of his opinion.*

*Children are hetterplzysiognomists, at least they are better “discerllers
of the thoughts of the heart,” by the appearance ofthe countenance, than
we are apt to regard them. What are conceived by many a teacher to be
the children’s own cogitatioms or__inventious, areﬂvery often the mere

27

He who is convinced of the truth of what
is here affirmed, will take special pains to
avoid falling into such an erroneous haloit.--—
He will endeavor to lead  pupils to think
rather than to imitate,.or decipher, or echo
back his own, thoughts. It is indeed one ex-»
cellence of slate, and black board and oral
exercises, that there is not apt to be so much
of the error alluded to, connected with these
modes of instruction, as with many other
modes. i Still, as We have seen, there is dan-
ger, even here. i ,

Whenshorizontal, Vertical, and oblique line
have been formed, from time to time, into
squares, parallelograms, and the Various sorts
of right angled triangles, the pupil should be
permitted to make circles of various sizes like
the following; beginning, of course, with the
larger, and proceeding, at successive lessons,
to the smaller. o '

> -He‘ should also also he required to make =

parts of circles; of which I here present a
specimen: i o

5 v. .

ec_h_o ofhis own heart or brain, or the plain indication of his manner-,
tone and emphasis.’ ‘ ’

28

 

 

Here, too, as in the former case, I would
ﬁrst teach them to make these various ﬁgures
Without their names; and afterward apply
the names, in the form of a review of the les-
sons, at the black-board; as mentioned under

‘ another head. a

We should not proceed farther with our

29

pupils at once, toward the region of drawing,
than to teach themto make straight lines and
circles, and their Various combinations. It
might be useful, however, to combine these,
rather more variously than has been thus far
recommended. ' For example, I would add a
triangle or as half circle to the top of a square.

Qnei of these I would say, when the class

could pretty Well imitate it, resembles a house,
except that it has no chiney; can you tell
me which itis ?  

They might also, indeed they should be
taught to combine triangles in such a Way as
to make larger triangles and squares 3 and
squares should be so combined as to make

"larger squares, and if possible other ﬁgures.———-
Let the ingenuity of the pupils be particularly

exercised, on this last point.
i They may be asked, moreover, What objects,
in the room or elsewhere, are square like the
ﬁgure they have made‘ on the slate; or What
ones approximate closely to such or such a
shape, r  

In this connection, they may be led to see
that a circle faintly, though but faintly, rep-»

2

resents the sun, the moon, a button, a piece
of money, a plate, a basin, the face of aclock
or a Watch, a ring, 860,- The human face, an
eye, 850., may be referred to, and the pupils
may be told what is meant by elliptical and
oval. . p

As the subject becomes more and more fa-»
miliar, and the mind of the pupil advances, he
may be taught to form many other geometri-
cal ﬁgures. On this- sub_ject—-—that of teaching
What may be called the elements of ge-
ometry to Very‘ young children, as Well as for
the sake of practical illustration—I am dis-
posed, for once, to fortify my opinion by
authority. The late Rev. Joseph Emerson,
whose talents and skill as a teacher are known
throughout New England, has the following
reinarks 

“Geometry, in its nature, is one of c the pri-

rnary studies. It may be understood by itself

Without the knowledge of any other branch,
except a Very little of language and arithme-=
tic ; while scarcely any other branch can be

which is, in itself, quite a complete manual for teachers“

31

Well understood Without some acquaintance
With Geometry .

“It is my opinion that the child should

commence the study of Geometry before 1earn- i

ing the alphabet. He is not, indeed, prepared
to encounter the elements of Euclid; but he
can clearly comprehend some of the distin-
guishing properties of a straight line and a
curve; of a circle, a triangle, a square, and an
ellipse; of a cube and of a sphere. As the
subject becomes familiar, and his mind strength-
ens, he is able to understand some of the dis-
tinguishing properties of a pentagon, hexagon,
heptagon, &c. 3 of the different. kinds of tri-
angles; of an oblate and prolate spheroid ; of
a parallelopiped, of a prism, of a cone, and of
pyramids. He may then go back to the cir-
cle, and attend to its properties, more partic-
ularly in the consideration of arcs, chords,
segments, sector, radii, diameters, sines, tan-
gents, ‘degrees, minutes, seconds, the mariner’s
compass, &c., &c. He may then proceed to
a more particular consideration of angles, tri-
angles, squares, &c., &c.

32

Nothing, it istrue, is here said about the
slate and black board ; but if these things are
to be taught, at an early age, there can -he no
doubt that the slate and black board are most
happily calculated to aid in the Work. a

Following out, then, on the black hoardand
slates,——-at least in some good degree-——.-—the
ideas Which Mr. Emerson has suggested, the
pupils should be taught the pentagon, hexagon,
heptagon, and octagon ; as Well as he led to
some general ideas ofarcs, segments, diamee
ters, and the like. We should be exceedingly
careful, however, not to fatigue our pupils,
especially at ﬁrst, With hard names. The
nameof the plainest, most common ﬁgures,
may, indeed, be taught them, but notso With
the moredifﬁcult. i

Perhaps in the progress of this kind of in-=
struction, it would bean excellent plan tohgive
out a lesson on the black board, in which cira

cles. of various size might be said toiresemblex

certain round,;but very different objects.-—-—
Thus the ﬁrst circles might; represent thesun;
the next, a little smaller, the moon 5 another

or two, very small, and perhaps a. little gib-=

bous, some of the stars.

The following might be drawn on the black
board as specimens of combining both right
lines and others.

Again, at another lesson, the ﬁrst or larger
square might be said to representthe ﬂoor of
the room, the second, (Very small, in propor»
tion,) the table ; a third very small also,
and rather oblong, a book. Again,on another
occasion, b‘[1t by no means at the same time,
let the largest square represent the common,
or some open ﬁeld, Well known to them all ;
the second in size should represent some gar-

den, equally Well known; a third the play
ground, or the spot" of ground on which the
house, stands, &c. c

‘ But to return to circles. This ﬁgure, says
the teacher, represents the clock face ; and
that the Watch. Now, on this largest one, I
will put letters like those on the clock. If
the pupils are none of them quite prepared to
imitate him, his efforts to please them will at
least afford them a good deal of amusement.
So would an attempt of the same sort to rep»
resent the mariner’s compass.

One exercise more may be mentioned under
this head, I alliide to the combination of
various portions of circles with each other,

and with right lines, in order to prepare the

Way for making, ere long, the letters of the
alphabet. To a Vertical or perpendicular line,
for example, they may be shown how to add
30118 or two semicircular lines. First one, in
this way, D 3 or in this, P ; or in this,‘ b,——-
Becondly, two half circles may be "added, as
in this case, B.

;Some might be apprehensive that the last

36?

mentioned exercise would edegenerate into
mere play. This depends much on the spirit
and manner of the teacher. In proper hands,
however, no ‘such result need be apprellended.

Few go so far towards this extreme as to be

exposed to any considerable» degree of da.»11-»
germ. '

:-—————:———-—-—-—

FORMING LETTERS, AND THE Freunns USED IN
V ARITHMETIC.

L The pupil is presumed to be ready,at length,
for instruction in making the letters. As the
ﬁrst step, We should select such capital letters
(for I Would begin With the capitals on account

of their mathematical shape) as can he made '

from the simple elementary lines with which
the child is already acquainted.

Perhaps the most simple letter to begin
With is 1. Next to this, however, may follow
L, H, T, Z, E, F. Not at once, of course, but
in succession; and only one of them at a time.
Iwould not proceed to a second, till the pupil
Was somewhat familiar with the ﬁrst. ‘

Next tothese might follow those made up,
in part, or in Whole, of circles. First Or‘
then Q and C ; and then D, P, B, R and G.

2* V at

38

And lastly would follow those which are more
irregular, in two classes ; first, W, V, A, K,
M, N, X and Y ; and secondly J, S and U.
At ﬁrst, I Would form no combinations of
these, nor eventeach them their names, but
soon proceed to the smaller letters, teaching
them in a similar manner ; that is beginning

Withgthe more simple in form, and going one

to the more diﬂicult and complicated. Thus
o, i, s, V, W, X, Z. &c., are among the more
easyto be imitated; While a, g,r, y, &c., are
more difficult. These small letters,moreoVer»
should be Written by theteacher, on the black
board Very large. It is no matter if they are
six times as large as they usually appear in
the pages of a common book. The reason of
this is that they may be seen distinctly, by

the pupils ; and be more easily imitated.-——.

They Will, of course, be apt to make them
somewhat smaller than the copy.»

It is, important that considerable time
should be spent in these last exercises 3 es-
pecially in making the small letters. The
beneﬁts to be obtained thereby are numerous.

139
Elet me observe however, that in teaching
children to make the small letters-—-though
not the large ones-—--We should in proceeding,
give them their names, requiring them to re-
memberthem. J Thus when We have written
V on the black board, We should say 3 now

We are all going to Write vee ; and after the

letter is made or atte-rnpted——-Now how many
of you know What the name of this letter is ?
As many as do will raise their hands, &c.—-—~
Thus should We proceed through the Whole
alphabet. -

It may interest the pupils also, to know
that many of the small letters, no less than
the larger ones, are made up essentially Of
parts of” circles. This is the ease with a, b,
c,d,e,g,p,q_ands.y At t 1

There will be nothiilg lost in spending
considerable time in teaching the young, or
even those who are a little older, to make the
letters of the alphabet with a good dealof ac-
curacy ; not only the small ones, but the large
ones also. In doing this I would proceed in
the manner indicated on page 24 ; remem-
bering; at the same time, the cautions which

49

were there thrown out. I would however,
first teach them, whether singly or by classes,
those which are most alike—————those which

could be, most naturally associated. Thus if

We set them a lesson on the black board, con-
sisting of sejveral’ different letters, it should be
made up oilsucsh as Very much resemble each
other, rather than of those Whose resemblance
is less apparent. L, I, T, H, &c., consist
Wholly of Vertical and horizontal lines 3. W,

V, A, &c., of oblique andhorizontal ones; 0,

Q, S, and a, 0, s and g, Wholly of curved lines ;
and may therefore be properly classed togeth-
er, Whenever classiﬁcation is indispensable.

Many weeks-——I had almost said many.

months-—-may be spent, and I doubt not With
proﬁt, in writing. the small letters, either
alone or in combination With others,» For
Variety’s sake, if for no other reason, I would
however, sometimes bring together a combi-
nation of these--—such an one as had some
meaning, as dog, sot, cat, kite, nose. This
would be, it is true, a slight departure, for
the time, fromthe principles I have just laid
downeeof classiﬁcationm nevertheless as a

41

temporary expedient, I have no doubt of its
advantages. ' a

Two or three important objects would be
accomplished by spending considerable time
in this way. First the letters would be likely
to be well learned. To those, indeed, who
prefer, the new fashioned mode of teaching
whole words, before they are analized, or be-
fore we give them the names of the parts of
which they are composed, this reason would
have but little weight. Nevertheless, nearly
all our school, books are constructed with ref.
erence to the old mode of teaching letters be-
fore words 3 and as it is likely this Will be
the more usual mode of instructing in our
common schools for many years to come. I
have at least proceeded in these exercises upon
that supposition or expectation.

Secondly, the pupils will be acquiring, all
this while——-that is if they are attended to--

_ the habit of properly holding and using a pen- i

cil ; and this preparation for the future,‘ must

of course be attended to somewhere.
Thirdly, they will be preparing to learn to

spell, read and write. I know it will be

42

doubted by some, Whether such exercises ac-=
tually prepare the way for writing ; but this
point will be made more clear in another
place.  

One useful exercise to the young, at every
stage of their instruction, especially at this
Very early stage, is that of requiring them to
distinguish the size, shape, &c., of objects,
such as circles and letters; and trace resem-»

blances. Too much importance, as it seems

to me, can hardly be attached to this exercise.
I will therefore present a few illustrations. _

The teacher writes, on the black board, the
letters. 0 and c. i Now how many of you, he
says, can tell me the difference between these
two letters ? The true clifference between
them is then pointed out. So of e and c;
s and z; i and y; and m and 11.

What is the name of this ? says the teach-

er; at the sametime making a large circle

on the black board. sWhat is this’? at the
same time making a small one. You say, he
adds, that they are both circles; are they
both ]then alike ? THOW many think they are

is

different. AWill some of you tell me the dif»

:ference?

The teacher makes a triangle and a circle,
What is the name of the ﬁrst? What of the
second ? Are they alike ? How do they
differ '2 Is there any other difference ?

“ From what is the letter i made up? Of
vertical lines, horizontals, or circles? The
letters w and V? The letters 0, c and e? The
teacher writes lo on the black hoard. Address-
ing himself to a particular individual, he says,
“ I see your hand is raised ; you may tell us.”
A perpendicular line and a circle, is the re-

ply. - “ Is it a wholeicircle, or a pan‘ of one C?”

A part.

“ I will i now? make three letters, on the
black board,” says the teacher ; at the same
time making W, V and A. “ What do these
letters most resemb1e—-triangles, squares, or
circles?” What do these three most resem-

ible, C, G and Q. Here are two, X and Y,

what do these most resemble C?”

“ What is thedifference between W and V 2
How many can tell me ? W What is thedifferi-W

44

ence between V and A. ? What is the differ-
ence between M and N ? What between B
and P? Which is made up from a perpendic-a
ular line, a horizontal, and a part of a circle?
Which from  perpendicular, and part of two
circles? Of what sort of lines is Z made’?
How does Z diﬁer from N ?”

But as I have elsewhere said, I would dwell
most on the small letters, and the nine ﬁgures
or digits. I would question the pupils fre-
quently and minutely on both these. In no
way can they be made to remember them so
well as in this manner.

When they have become familiar with all
the small letters, the teacher should proceed
to teach them how to make the nine digits, as
they are sometimes called; I mean the char:
acters used in arithmetic. With these, as
with the alphabet, I would proceed slowly and
cautiously; always observing, as much’ as
possible, the maxim which requires us to do
but one thing at a time.

1 But would you‘ pass over the larger letters,

and not name them atall? some may perhaps

45

ask. I do not think it necessary to name
them; indeed, I think it confuses the pupil to
find there are tWon’s for example so strikingly
diﬁerent as our large and small one. The
names of the large letters will be acquired by
degrees, as the pupil advances to Writing,
spelling, deﬁning, reading, &c. I have taught
multitudes of little children to read, who came
to me ignorant of their letters 3 and yet I do
not recollect that I ever taught the names of
any considerable number of the large letters.

We come then, to the nine digits, or ﬁgures
of arithmetic. These should be taught one
by one, by means of the black board and

the slates; beginning, of course, With the sim«

plest, as 1, 8 and 3. The ﬁrst, itis obvious,
at a glance, is principally a vertical line ; T the
second and third are made up, essentially, of
two circles each. Four of the others, 2, 5, 6
and 9, are made of chieﬂy of parts of circles;
and 4 and 7, of right lines ; either horizontals
or Verticals. A

It is hoped that these exercises, in teaching
the Alphabet,“and the ﬁgures used in Arith-

46

inetic, will not be regarded as tedious or un—
necessary. I believe that, if the plan which
is here suggested is not the {very best, it is at
least one of the best Which has ever yet been
attempted. At all events it is inﬁnitely bet-
ter than. the equally long road which the tyre
was once compelled to travel without taking
much interest in What he was doing. But
Whether the best method or not of merely
learning the Alphabet (that it is the most rapid
I do not pretend) one thing is certain, Viz :
that children are interested in it, and that it
affords them, for a time, full employment.—_———~
But. it has an advantage greaterstill. It is
an excellent preparation for the studies, Which
in the usual course of an English education,
ordinarily follow, e

CHAPTER IV. ‘

 

MAP MAKING .

The idea of placing map making next in
order tothe alphabet, may be thought a little
singular by many teachers. They have been
accustomed to regard Geography, they Will say,
as coming in at a much later period.

But it is not geography, properly so called,
which I propose to introduce here ; but only
an exercise ‘Which is preparatory to geography.
Nor do I propose to teach even map making
to any considerable extent just now, but only
to make a beginning ; for which purpose I
suppose this to be the most appropriate place.

The exercises of Chapter II. were a means,

‘among other things, of preparing the Way for
map making. In fact some of them may be

considered as little less than the ﬁrst steps in
this important art. Such, in particular, Was

48

that of representing the common, the play
ground, the school room and the table, by
means of so many squares.

There can be little doubt that in making
maps, if not in the study of geography itself,
the best Way is to begin at home- Indeed, at
the present day, this is a point conceded by
nearly every intelligent and successful teach»
er; and not a few of our school geographies
are constructed With reference “to this impor-
tant principle.

Having initiated the pupil, I would set him
to makingmaps of the school room, and of
other rooms, places, and things, in good earn-
est. In making a map of the school room, he
should» be taught to mark the places Where
some of the principal things stand, such as
the stove and teacher’s desk; as Well as the
places occupied by the doors and Windows.

The teacher Will, of course, lead the Way in
this exercise on the black board. After

drawing the outlines of the room, he Will sayy

‘‘ What shall I place here ?” pointing to the
spot Where it Will be obvious to some of them;

49

if   not all, must be the place for the stove, or
the .teacher’s desk. If they raise their hands
in token that they know, he then asks some
one. Suppose itisthe stove which is to be
located, and it stands on the south side of the

room. He Lnextoasks, putting down his pencil

onthe opposite or nothern side, at the place
which should indicate the spot on which the
desk stands; “What shallwe put here ?”i———-

The answer is elicited in the same wayas be;

fore, and theplace of the deskis accordingly
marked on the map. “Whatshalll put down
here? How many of you can tell?” All raise
their hands. Addressing himself to a partic-

ularcpupil, he says, “ You may tell us.” Of

rthedoor, in like manner he asks; “Where
shall it be placed? Q Where shall I put the
southwest window?  Where the northwest?”
&ci.   r    
.NeXtto:ra.:map of the school-room, should

he ,a rnapot the school-house. There are stew
school-houses which contain no more than

barelythe school-oroorn. Most of them contain
an entrance and clothes room; some a wood
r1"tO0m ;r and ‘a few. have one or more recitation

50

rooms. All these should be marked * oﬁ, on
the map 3 ﬁrst on the black board, and then
on the slates; For Whatever is Worth prepa-
ring on the black board, by the teacher and
the pupilsconjointly, is usually Worth copy-
ing by the pupils upon their slates; In any
event, all maps, how much soever the pupils
have had to do in assisting the teacher to pre-L
pare them, should be transferred to their
slates, ,

If there is a play ground regularly enclosed,
in connection with the school-house, a map of
this should come next. If not, the pupils
may be required to make a map of the road
near the school-house, or of some open space

or common, if there is one near by, with which a

they are all familiar. Qﬂext to the map of a
play ground, that of the road near the school-
house is usually the most interesting to child-
ren. lt affords, in general, a greater number
of important parts, such as here a tree, there
a brook or a bridge; there a house 3 there a
shed; there a Well ; there a barn; there the
beginning of another road, &c. L p
When the pupils of any school can copy

5i
from the black board, maps of the schoolbroom,
the school-house, and the road, and tell the
points of compass with relation to each map,
the teacher may reqaire of them to draw on
their slates, without having any thing to do
with the black board, a map of their father's
house, or garden, or the road near it. Of
course, neither he nor any one of his pupils
may be able to correct the errors of each, in
all particulars; though it will usually happen
that there will be somebody in the school
who will be able to make the necessary corrections, The exercise, in any event, is one
of the most valuable that can be given.
From a map of the road near the schoolhouse, they may proceed to a map of the other
roads, not far distant, especially if there is any
thingstriking near or on theroad; as a church,
factory, tavern, prison, or store. With the
aid of the teacher, who must, of course, lead
the way on the black board, the pupils of a
school might be taught to make maps of most
of the roads and streets throughout the region
where they were brought up, as well as of52
most of the fields adjoining them, near the
school-house, and their respective homes.
The next step in the natural progress of
things is to make a map of the town. This
is always exceedingly interestingto the young.
For though it cannot be very large on a single
black board, nor so large on the slates as on
the black board, yet there will be room enough,
in general, for the principal public roads in
town, with all the streams, large and small,
and the lakes, ponds, and mountains, if any
exist.  This putting down the brooks and
ponds, with which many of the pupils must
be more or less familiar, is not only exceedingly interesting, but it prepares the way for
the right preparation and understanding of
other maps.
From a map of the town, the teacher will
proceed to draw a map of some three or four
or five adjoining towns, with their own town
in the centre. Further than this exercise it
would, I think, be premature, to require the
pupils to go. He may indeed go on and make
a map of the county, the state, &amp;c.; but not
as a lesson for the pupils, but only to prepare
the way for the fuiture.Before going so far as a map of the county
in which the pupil resides, there is another
exercise which may be commenced here,
though it cannot or at least ought not to
be carried t6 any considerable extent, until
the pupil is fairly inducted into the study of
geography. I refer to the use of dissected
maps. In pursuance of the present plan, I
would first draw on paper the outlines of the
towns immediately adjoining that in which the
teacher and pupils were, including of course
their own town; and then cut them apart,
precisely on the town lines. These it should
be the business of the pupil to bring together
again into their original shape and relative
position,
At the same time, however, a map made
by the teacher on the black board will be desirable; for young pupils find it more difficult,
at first, to put a dissected map together than
we may be aware; and will not be directed
too much, by the black board. Afterward
however they may be required to unite them
properly without the black board.
They will not proceed far, in these various
354
processes, before they should be required, one
at a time, to come to the black board and draw
maps on that, to be corrected by the class
after they have finished. They should begin
with the most simple; becaulse although they
were able to do something more on their own
slates, yet when called to stand before the
whole school, and with the recollection too,
that they may be criticised by them, most
pupils will be at first a little embarrassed.
A dissected map of the whole county seems
to be the next thing in order unless the county
were remarkably large; in which case I would
omit it, and pass on to a dissected map of the
States of the Union. The towns, unless in
one's own county, and that county of very
moderate size, are such small divisions, that
it is hardly advisable to attempt to put together the towns of a whole state; except
perhaps those of such small states as Rhode
Island and Delaware.
But I would not at once push the work of
map making very far. I would leave it for
the present, and attend awhile to writing; or55
rather to the formation of letters and words
mechanically.CHAPTER V.
WRITING ON THE SLATE.
The first lesson in what I have here called
slate writing--by which, however, I mean the
mere mechanical formation of letters and
words-is a lesson of oblique lines. They
may be of greater or less length; especially
at different lessons; but I have thought that,
for beginners, about three-fourths of an inch
was sufficient. Thus,
The slope and distance from each other, I
should regard of more consequence than any
thing else, especially the slope. After a few57
lessons of.that.sort,* from-the black board, I
would teach the lower curve of letters.  In
other words I would teach them to make the
i or 1, and also to join it, as follows; except
on a larger scale..1.!112l1  1111112II'When pupils are familiar with the lower
curve of-letters, and can form the i, t, 1, b and
u separately, and afterward join them, thus;
itlbu-or rather, thus; iutlb-I would proceed
to form the reverse of this-the upper curve
thus 2 2 and to join it, thus-ll222222222,.  This
done, the double curve comes next, and forms
a portion of the h, the m, the n, and the v.Lastly, I would teach the o; from.which are
derived, in part or in whole, c, d, e, g, q and
X.
They need not be-troubled long, with these
elementary lessons. They are better adapted
to writing on paper; to come in sometime
afterward.  Still I would proceed a while upon
system, even on the slate. Where we lose
*This exercise was anticipated in Chap. II., so that a few lessons only
is thiis place w:ill be necessary.58
nothing by being systematic, system is always
preferable. It is valuable on its own account;
but it is still more valuable as a matter of
mental discipline.
When a child can form the greater part of
the small letters, both singly and in combination, it will be well to employ him in putting
words together. Writing the first elements
-the 1, z, r, z, o and i-on the black board,
the teacher should inquire of the pupils, from
which of these. he must make the letter i. Is
it from the first, the second, the third, the
fourth, or the fifth? Being told it must be
made from the second, he accordingly makes
it, and then asks, Is it finished? What is to
be added?
Perhaps it is hardly necessary to say that
the pupils should have time allowed them, in
every instance, to write on their slates, what
the teacher first writes on the black board.I mean, by this, that they should not be hurried too much.
"cc From which of these" the teacher asks
c"shall I make the t?  Is there nothing to be
added? What is to be added? How does t,59
thus made, differ from i? Does it differ from
it, in nothing except its length? What do I
call the turni of the i and t, at the bottom?"
(This question presumes that the terms upper
curve, lower curve, &amp;c., have been explained.)
From -which of them shall I make the letter
m? Htow many of each-the third and fourth
-must I take? Which must I take, and how
manP, to make n, w, v, h? Is there nothing
added to the fourth to make v?  What is
added to make w? What is added to the third
to make r? What to the second to make I?
Here I would have a sort of review. How
does m differ from n? Both letters should be
standing on the black board when this question is asked. So should any others between
which the teacher attempts to make a comparison. How does w differ from v? How does
I differ from b? How does i differ from the
half of u? How do i and I differ? How do
i and t, &amp;c.?
It is not difficult to show a pupil that the
first half of the a, d, g, and q, with c and e,
are essentially the same as the o; the only60
difference, in any case, being derived from a
very slight omission or addition.  Nor will it
be difficult, after a pupil has learned to form
all the regular letters, such, I mean, as can be
chiefly made from a few single elements like
the foregoaing, to teach him to make a few irregulars:; such as s, x and z.
Nor will there be much difficulty about the
capitals.  Even these, however, for the convenience of the teacher, may be classed.Thus three or four of them are essentially a
part of the letter 0, somewhat enlarged; as
C, G, E and X. A still larger class, a very
large one, are formed essentially from  the
main stroke of the I. Thus, B D, FD,  H, L,
P, R, S, T and Z, are all of this description.
Then A, M, N and W, form    another small
class by themselves, which are soon and easily
imitated. These three classes comprise nearly
the whole alphabet of large letters; there are
only a very few irregulars.
That which delights me most in connection
with these exercises is that instead of being
irksome to the pupils, they are to them almost
like pastimes; and they are sometimes as sorryto have them at an end, as if they were really
such.
Let it be remembered, however, that it is
not so much the object- at least I think it
ought not to be-to teach writing, as an art,
on the slate, as to teach it in a sort of imitative way, in order to prepare the pupil for
several other important exercises which should
precede the exercise of writing on paper.
There is one exercise which if pursued simultaneously with the foregoing, would greatly
enhance the interest of the pupil, to say nothing of the profit which might accrue. I refer
to a little device sometimes resorted to -that
of cutting out from pasteboard, or paper, five
or six elementary principles of letters, and requiring the pupil to combine them, to form
letters. He must, it is true, have a considerable number of each; but they are soon and
easily made. By putting them together, however, I do not mean attaching them to each
other in any way, but simply laying them
side by side, continguous to one another, on
the desk or table.
The exercises of the chapters which follow,
9*62
pursued according to the suggestions which
accompany them, and taken along with the
elementary studies of this chapter* will be
likely, in nine cases in ten, to make the pupils of a school very good writers; better I
dare say, without ever having any thing to
do in school with pen and ink, than the average of our common school writers.   This is
not saying that pen and ink should never be
used, for they should, without doubt.  But
these exercises, instead of standing in the way
of the subsequent use of pen, ink and paper,
would, if studied as they outht to be, and has
been recommended,greatl y a l itate the pupil's
progress.   Yet I still say tiat even if he
should never receive any direct instruction of
this sort in school, he could not fail, from
such a long practice with his pencil and slate,
and from such varied exercises, to become a
very tolerable writer.
If any one should doubt-I know there are
a few who do-whether children will ever
become good writers, from merely practicing
*They have the efect of a daily review, in the fmatter of hand writing;
and frequent reviewirng the studies of school, is, as every teaclher of much
experience knows, the only means of making lmuch real progress.63
6n the slate, we need not refer him to Iceland,
for proof, where all children learn in a manner not unlike that, and never or almost never
in: any way which is more systematic. We
have only to send him to some of our schools
fori the instruction of' the deaf and dumb,
where many are to be found who write elegantly on slates, and who never yet wrote on
aiSy thing else. We have testimonj on the
same subject, however, in Wood's account of
the Sessional School in Edinburgh, and in the
Connecticut Common School Journal. I have
myself seen very young pupils, in common
schools-say not more than six or seven
years of age-who already wrote a very good
hand, on the slate, though they had never
written a word with pen and' ink in their
lives.
We are now prepared, as I triust, for the
important school exercise of spelling. At
present--I mean on the old system-we have
but very few persons among us who spellwell;
let us see whether slate and black board ex~
ercises promise any thing better.CHAPTEER VI,
SPELLING.
Few. things belonging to a good English
Education seem to be of more importanlce than
correct spellng. I shall therefore treat oi
this subject at considerable length,
As in other things, so it is in teaching spell,
ing; we may first, instruct the whole school,
at once; or secondly we mx ay instruct portions
of it, as classes or individuals; or thirdly,
the instruction may be given by means of
certain older pupils, acting on our behalf, as
~moinitors or assistants; or as they are some-times, and not unaptly called word givers.
The methods of teaching spelling, with the
aid of slates and black boards, are almost innumerable.   I shall select some four or five
only; such as seem to mne to be among the
best.  Those which I have selected, will be65
found applicable, to the existing condition of
most, if not all of our common schools.
First Method.  The teacher takes his position by the black board, with the whole
school or the class, as the case may be, facing
him, and after ascertaining that he has secured
the attention of all, proceeds with his chalk
in hand, to write down a spelling lesson.
But what shall he write?    What word
shall he begin with? For there is certainly
a. choice to be exercised; it is not a matter
of entire indifference what words are written
down. It must be obvious to all who reflect
that the selection should be made with reference to the wants and capacities of the pupils.
We will suppose, for the present, that they
are just beginning to spell; having previously
learned to read and write letters, and to make
the figures used in Arithmetic, with a few of
the silmpler geometrical figures. In such a
case the words of the lesson should be selected
on the general principle of beginning at home
-i. e. with words with the meaning of which
the pupil is already wholly or partially ac.,66
quainted.*   Such are slate, pencil, book, ink,
paper, stove, stove pipe, fire, coal, ashes, inkstand, fire-place, hand, eye, ear, face, mouth,
window, door, table, chair, wall, &amp;c.      Such
words as ceiling, and crayon, I would, at firsti
omit; for although they are near enough, they
are much more difficult, and may be deferred
to a subsequent lesson.
"I will now    write the word slate,"     the
teacher says.   "What letter shall I make
first?  Let all who know, raise their hands."
Addressing himself to a particular individual,
the teacher says, c" You may name it." The
pupil says " S."   The teacher writes it, i. e.
in the printed form.    "Wh.at shall I write
next?" he says. The answer being obtained
in the same way as before, he proceeds to the
next; then to the next; and so on till the
word is wholly written.
This is, indeed, a simple word, and a very
simple process; but neither the word nor the
process is too simple to begin with.    It need
*Some have thoughlt that the first words selected for a child to spell or
read, should be all short words-monosyllables. But it has seemed to me
otherwise. I know no reason why a young pupil may not as well and as
easily be taught to spell inkstand or stove pipe, as a great many of the monosyllables, which are usually presented to him.67
not be a slow process, especially after a beginning is fairly made. On the contrary, it:may be conducted, where all are attentive
and interested, with very great rapidity.
But it may happen that a pupil will name
a wrong letter. For example, in reply to the
question, what shall be written as the fourth
letter in the word slate, a pupil may say i.
" Is that right?" the teacher inquires of the
class.  Some one who raises his hand, in token of assent, may then be asked what letter
ought to be substituted for the i. The truly
ingenious teacher, however, will often select,
in his inquiry, the more inattentive or heed
less pupils, in order to secure their close at_
tention to the exercise.* Or he may write
the letter i, according to the wrong direction
of the pupil; and if no one should question
its correctness, by uplifted hand, he may go
through with writing the word; and then
after telling the class that a mistake has been
made, or that he has been directed wrong, he
may require them to correct it.
*When I say often, I do not mean always; for this praetice won',d ro,Juce
a set of evils which would tend to flefeat its own purpose.He then proposes another word, as hand;
proceeding with it in the same manner as the
word slate.  Though he should go slowly,
endeavoring to have every process understood,
he should nevertheless go straight forward,
and avoid, if possible, the loss of any time.
The list of words may be extended, as circumstances seem  to require. The first lessons, ought by all means, to be short; keepin view the general snd very important principle, never to fatigue or satiate the pupil, especially wvhenl setting out with a new subject
of study. When the lesson is completed, let
each pupil copy or transfer the words from
the black board to his slate,
One or two important principles, in the
beginning of such an exercise as this, should
never be lost sight of. First, the exercise, in
all its processes or parts, should be plsime.Do one thing at a time, as much as possible.Let the propriety of using capitals, here or
there, the character or quality of the hand
writing of the pupils, with size, slope, and
alm-ost every thing else, be overlooked, at first,
for the sake of simplicity.  Secondly, be not69
too particular about classifying or assorting
the words in regard to length, number of syllables, or any thing else. Classification is a
work which belongs to a more advanced stage
of progress.
Although the teacher, should, in general,
confine himself to one thing at a time, yet
after the school or class become somrewhat familiar with the method, and with a considerable number of words, it may be well to make
an occasional departure from this rule; more,
however, for the sake of variety than for any
other reason.
Thus, suppose he were about to write down
the word slate, as the beginling-of a spelling
lesson. He will say to his pupils, " Now in
order to write the word, must I begin at the
top or at the bottom of the black-board?Why at the top, rather than any where else?
You will tell me also that I must begin at
one side of the slate; now at which side;
the right hand side, or the left? Why-at the
left hand rather than the right? Must I
write horizontally, or obliquely? (This last
question takes for granted that the terms70
horizontal, &amp;c., are well understood.) Must
the word begin with a small s, or a large one?
This, I say, is designed as a mere specimen
of the little departures which a teacher may
properly make, at times, from his general
rule of going straight forward. Any thing
of the same general character with the foregoing, which while it serves to impart interest, is also in itself instructive, will be of evident advantage.
There is another way of proceeding which
may occasionally be resorted to. Thus, in
the example above, the teacher, after having
announced to the class that he is about to
write the word slate on the black board, proceeds to write it, without asking any questions
at first; but writes it wrong.  Instead of
slate, he writes slaet, or slait, or slat. Or instead of writing it horizontally, he writes it
obliquely. The pupils are then called upon
to say whether it is written correctly; and
if not, in what respects it is wrong. So of
ally other common word; as pencil, door, table, chair, coal, &amp;c.
It has been said that after the teacher has71
completed a list of words on the black board,
the pupils should be required to transfer them
to their slates. The object of this is two
fold; first to fix the orthography of the word
more firmly in the memory; and, secondly,
as an exercise in the art of writing.
That the first of these results will inevitably follow, no one who is at all acquainted
with children or with the structure of his own
mind, will, for a moment. doubt. Nothing,
certainly, is more common than for a child of
good memory to learn to repeat a hymn or
song, from beginning to end, merely by copying it.
To secure the second result-that of improving the hand-writing-our pupils should
be required, in copying any thing, to do it as
well as possible. In writing down words from
mere hasty dictation, it is true, this can hardly
be expected; on account of the difficulty, especially with children, of doing two things
well, at the same time. But in mere copying,
I say again, it is not only useful but highly
desirable; nay I might almost say indispensable. As a necessary preliminary, the word72
on.the blackboard-the copy set,by the.teacher
_--should be written in the best possible manner. Marks of haste or carelessness, and'above
all of absolute incorrectness, cannot fail to have
a bad -effect.  This.seasonable hint to teachers, will not, I hope, be overlooked or forgotten.  Let them   remember the maxim    of
Cousin, the French philosopher; "c As is the
teacher so is the school;" and let them remember that the remark is applicable even to
the hand-writing of.the teacher.
In this way, that is by a species of review,
will the pupil retain and perfect his skill in
the art or practice of writing.  There will be
so many exercises in which he will ibe liable
to forget.himself and write carelessly, that a
special effort here and there, at least when
merely copying something, will be indispensably necessary.
Second Method.  This consists in pronouncing or dictating words to the pupils, to be
written down by them, on their slates.' In
this exercise the use of the black board is not
absolutely necessary; although it can be used,
if desired.73
In pronouncing or dictating words, great
care should be taken to give to every syllable,
and even to every letter, its natural soundb
In this respect there is a great deal of error
among us, and-it is likely there will be a great
deal more, unless teachers beware of the bad
habits iin which most of them have been educated.
One of the more common errors of the class
to which I allude is that of spelling the- words
for the -pupil, in the act of pronouncing them.
It is by no means uncommon- for teachers to
pronounce the words: of a spelling lesson, in
such a manner, that they cannot avoid spelling them  correctly, if they Would.  Thus I
have heard positive and fugitive, pronounced
pos-i-tive and Ju-gi-tive. That is instead of
giving the vowels of the second and third! syllables of these words a short sound, they were
sounded long. And worse than even this, I
have heard the word above, pronouncedab-ove; as if the o had its: long full souud.
Let all these and other kindred errors, in
pronunciation be studiously avoided. Let
every word, be pronounced right, (that is as it74
should be pronounced in good conversation or
reading,) whether the pupils spell it correctly
or not. And if, in indicating words to smaller
classes, an elder pupil, or word-giver, is employed, the teacher should be exceedingly
careful that he does not lead them into errors
of the same sort, or of some other kind. In
general, these assistant pupils, or word givers,
ought either to be drilled by the teacher beforehand, or to recieve from him, for their
own use, exclusively, a printed or written list
of the words they are about to teach, For
this last purpose they may be permitted, at
times, to select words from  a given table or
page of a spelling book, or from a dictionary.
There are several ways of ascertaining
whether pupils write their words from dictation-that is to say spell them-correctly or
not.  One is by employing the word giver in
going around to them all and examining their
slates separately, and comparing them with
his own, or the standard list. Another is, for
the teacher to perform  the same service.Another is, to have each pupil read over, or
rather spell over the words, in an audible75
voice; the teacher stopping him and making
corrections, should any be necessary. Another way, still, is, for the teacher himself, to
correct the list of the right hand or left hand
pupil, (according to his own convenience or
choice,) and then for that pupil whose slate
he holds, to recieve and correct the slate of
his next neighbor; and so on, through the
class.
In general, however, it is better that the
correctness or incorrectness of the pupils should
be settled by some higher authority than that
of a fellow pupil. On this account, I should
prefer the second or third method of the preceding paragraph, were it not that as soon as
the first scholar reads-that is spells-a word
wrong, and the teacher alludes to the wrong
and sets about correcting it, such of the rest
of the class as have fallen into the same error
will be tempted to change theirs clandestinely,
to- make it correspond to the true standard.If they would do it openly, the evil would be
comparatively trifling; perhaps not an evil
at all; but it is unfortunate that we should'tempt them in this way to do wrong.76
With a view therefore to the prevention of
this evil, it may be well to adopt one of the
two following methods.    Let the teacher correct the slate of each pupil, without any communication with the other pupils; or let the
pupils themselves correct the list, with the
aid of a printed or written list, or a dictionary.
The last method would be the better of the
two, if every pupil would be as faithful and
conscientious as he ought to be; and if dictionaries were not almost as rare in our common school rooms, as pearls or diamonds.*
But whatever the method which is pursued
may be, it is well to continue on the lesson
till every one is thoroughly master of it.  If
there is any pupil who does not attend to it
properly, or whose memory is defective, it
may be well to put the particular words which
he cannot remember-for they will usually be
few in each lesson-on a piece of paper or
card, and carry it in his pocket a few days,
recurring to it, often, till he can remember its
contents.  
* Rev. T. H. Gallaudet, to whom the public are already deeply indebted
for his efforts in behalf of the rising generation, has recently prepared a
dictionary expressly for the use of common schools. I heve not seen it;
but presume at:once on its usefilness.77
If, however, he is really faulty--I mean voluntarily negligent- itv will do him  good to
write the words which he does not. remember
on the black board, in view of the whole
school, and sufler them to remain there till
Le can retain them in.his memory.  If compelled to have his faults exposed in this -way
a few times, there is reason to hope he will
soon take care to avoid such exposure as much
as possible.
Third -Method. Another, and a most excellent method of teaching spelling on the
slate and black board, is by applying or framing words into sentences.  In fact, the true
orthography of some words can hardly be
taught, to practical purpose, in any other
manner.
In pursuance of this method, the teacher
first writes a series o- short sentences on tlle
black board, omitting one important word in
e:tch. The sentences may be either original
or selected, according to his convenience.The following is an example of thp manner in
which the sentences might be arranged on the
black board.
478
The          glisten.
The moon is
Speak        and plain.
Books        be kept clean,.
The          is cold.
Always           truth.
This list of words is long enough to illustrate the principle, and give a clear idea of
the plan proposed; although for the use of a
class of pupils, it might, if necessary, be extended much farther. The sentences should
be written with great care; and the space left
for a word be so conspicuous that no pupil
could mistake its place.  The black board
being in full view, the pupils should proceed
to copy the sentences, with as much exactness
as possible.
In the foregoing lesson, stars is the word
which might supply the vacancy in the first
sentence. But it would be too muclh, perhaps,
for the greater part of a class of pupils, to
both find out the appropriate word and spell
it; at least fbr a little time, at first; the teacher
should, therefore, proceed to the work of dic79
tating. in succession, the words, stars, bright,
loud, should, air, and speak.  Other words
might indeed in some instances make good
sense, as, instead of air, we might insert
weather; and instead of speak, tell; but the
teacher will select those which appear most
natural.
The teacher should not fill the vacancies
on the black board, too soon. But when the
pupils have all filled out their blanks, on their
slates, he may fill out his own, or make the
corrections in any other manner, which he
may deem preferable.
I have said that the orthography of some
words can hardly be taught, to a practical
purpose, in any other manner, except in this
very way of incorporating them into sentences. The principal class of words alluded to
was those which are pronounced alike, but
spelled differently. Of this kind are son and
sun; coarse and course; ascent and assent, &amp;c.
These words are of every day occurrence, both
in conversation and writing; and therefore it
is of very great importance that we should
spell them with accuracy. And yet perhaps80
there is no class of words in the English language, so oftenl misspelled as this.
Although I doubt not I have made the general plan intelligible, yet it may not be amiss
to present one more example, involving a few
of the class of words now under consideration.
Thus the teacher may write on the black board
tuie following sentences:
The            shines.
We          on slates.
My, obey thy father.
What          you?
The clear         sky.
I-e fell down
Always do
is t,he staff of life.
The                of a shoe.
Which is the         of the room?
The            contain blood.
Bring some               and place it
on the fire.
Now though these sentences should be carefully arranged, and the proper words dictated
jby the teacher, few pupils would probably be81
found able to spell them all right.  A nd yet,
I say once more, I know of no other way in
which their orthography can be correctly
taught by the instructor or learned by the pupil. They may, indeed, be committed to
memory, as they often are; still it will require
long, very long practice before a pupil can, in
-every instance, make the proper application.
After some time has passed, and the teacher
has dictated the proper words to be supplied
in several successive lessons. the pupils may
be permitted to supply them in their own way.
But this part of the exercise belongs as much
to defining and composition as to spelling;
perhaps even more. Do not be hasty in introducing it; remembering still, the maxim,
c" one thing at a time."
Let it not be objected that such a method
of learning to spell is slow. I know it is so.
Still it seelms to me one of the best in the
world--perhaps the very best-for practical
purposes. Though a pupil atlvances, on this
road, very leisurely, what he learns will, no
doubt, be better undlerstood and longer retained, than if the process were more rapid.82
It has at least two excellencies; first, that it
always appears to excite interest; and secondly, that it teaches children to think and to
write down their thoughts, as well as to spell.
The only serious drawback upon its excellency
is the pains it will cost. In respect to the latter, however, he who does not know that
nothing valuable is to be gained in school
without hard labor, has not yet learned one of
the most important secrets of his profession.
There must be hard digging in school, as some
very quaintly call it, and in fact one of the
great ends of all education is to teach the
young to dig, both for knowledge and excellence.
Fourth Method,    This is most happily
adapted to those who have already made considerable progress in the art of spelling, although it may be used to some extent, with
all. Its only peculiarity is that of classifying
the words to be spelled. It will be recollected
that I have spoken of classification as not to
be adhered to in setting out with the black
board, but to come in somewhat later.We have no'First Book for children that
(classifies words as much as seems to me desirable; at least I have seen none. Mr. J F.
Bumstead, of Boston, has indeed prepared
series of two or three, which I believe have
been adopted in the Boston Primary Schools,
in which the words are to a considerable extent, classified; and I have heard of one more,
published elsewhere, but have not seen it.Nor am I over anxious to see such books, at
least for the pres-ent. I am more anxiolus to
see teachers able to render themselves (with
the aid of the slate and black board,) the best
spelling book for the pu,il, which, for a time,
he could possibly lave. After we have learned
the art.of proceading., for a time, with the last:mentioned spelling book, w.e may perhaps be able
to miake a wise use of some other kind.
But what do you mean, I shall no doubt be
asked, by classifying words for the young to
spell? I will endeavor to explain. And first
I will speak of what might be called a natural
cilassification.
We should not only begin at home, with
the -known, in everything, and proceed gradun
