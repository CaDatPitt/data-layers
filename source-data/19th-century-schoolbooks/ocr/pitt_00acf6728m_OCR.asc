OF ERONUNCIATION IN GENERAL.

THE "best judges among the ancients have repre-

sented Pronunciation, which they likewise called
Action, as the principal part of an orator’s province;
from whence he is chieﬂy to expect success in the art
of persuasion. When Cicero, in the person of Crassus,
has largely and elegantly discoursed upon all the other
parts of oratory, coming at last to speak of this, he says‘,
“ All the former have their effect as they are pronoun-

ced. It is the action alone which governs in speaking:

without which the best orator is of no value; and is
often defeated by one, in other respects, much his in-
ferior.” And he lets us know, that Demosthenes was
of the same opinion; who, when he was asked what

" was the principal thing in oratory, replied, Action;

and being asked again a second and a third time, what
was next considerable, he still made the same answer.

It was undoubtedly an abominable doctrine. l
thought so then, and think so still 2 but nevertheless,
it was a popular doctrine," and came immediately from
those who were called the friends of liberty; how de-
servedly, time will show. True liberty, in my opin-
ion, can only exist when justice is equally administered

to all ; to the king, and to the beggar. Where is the

ustice, then, or where is the law, that protects a mem-
laer of parliament more than any other man, from the
punishment due to his crimes ? The laws of this coun~
try allow of no place, nor any employment, to he ‘a
sanctuary for crimes ; and where l have the honor to
sit as judge, neither royal favour, nor popular applause
shall ever protect the guilty. , . ,

EXTRACT raom A smm on THE DAY or JUDGMENT.

ET us endeavour to realize the majesty and terror
ofthe universal alarm on the ﬁnal Judgment Day.
When the. dead are sleeping in the silent grave; when
the living are thoughtless and unapprehensive of the
grand event, or intent on other pursuits; some of them
asleep in the dead of night ; some of them dissolved in
sensual pleasures, eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage ; some of them planning or execu-
ting schemes for riches or honors; some in the very

act of sin; the generality stupid and careless about.‘

the concerns of eternity, and the dreadful day just at
hand; and a few here and there conversing with their
God, and looking for the glorious appearance of their
Lord and Saviour ; when the course of nature runs on
uniform and regular as usual, and inﬁdel scoll'ers are

taking urnbrage from thence to ask, “ Where is the 

promise ofshis coming?” In short, when there are no
more visible appearances of this approaching day, than
of the destruction ot Sodom, on that clear morning in

which Lot ﬂed away; or 03 the deluge, when Noah.en'- ‘

tered into the ark: then, in thathour of unapprehensive
security, then suddenly shall the heavens open over the
astonished world; then shall the alarming clangor break
over their heads like a clap of thunder in a clear sky.

Immediately the living turn their gazin eyes upon
the amazing ‘phenomenon: some hear tie long—ex-
pected sound with rapture, and lift up their heads with
‘oy, assured that the day of their redemption 15 come ;

while the thoughtless world are struck with the wild- .

est horror and consternation. In the same instant the
géeund reaches all the mansions of the dead ; and in a
ﬁioment, in the twinkling of an eye, they are raised,
and the living are changed. This call will be as ani-
mating to all the sons of men, as that call to a single
person, “ Lazarus, come forth.” 0 what asurprise
will this be to the thoughtless world! Should this alarm
burst over our heads this moment, into what a terror
would it strike many in this assembly? Such will be
the terror, such the ‘consternation, when it actually
comes to pass. Sinners will be the same titnorous,se1f-
condemned creatures then as they are now. And then
they will not be able to stop their ears, who are deaf to
all the gentler calls of the gospel now.

Then the trump of God will constrain them to hear
and fear, to whom the ministers of Christ new preach
in vain. Then they must all hear; for, “ all that
are in their graves,” all without exception, “ shall
hear his voice.” Now the voice of mercy calls, reason
Eleads, conscience warns ; but multitudes will notéhear.

ut this is a voice which shall, which must reach every
one of the millions of mankind, and not one of them will
be able to stop his ears. Infants and giants, kings and
subljects, all ranks, all ages of mankind shall hear the
cal . The living shall start and be changed, and the
dead rise at the sound. The dust that was once alive
and formed a human body, whether itsﬂies in the air.
ﬂoats in the ocean, or ve etates on earth, shall hear

the new-creating ﬁat. herever the fragments of

the human frame are scattered, this all penetrating call

shall ‘reach and speak them into life. VVe may con-
sider this voice as a summons not only to dead bodies
to rise, but to the souls that once animated theni, to ap-
pear and be re-united to them. ' *

This summons shall spread through every corner of
the universe ; and Heaven, Earth, and Hell, and all

their inhabitants, shall hear and obey. N ow methinks ii

I see, I hear the earth heaving, charnel houses rattling,
tombs bursting, graves opening. Now the nations un-
der ground begin to stir. There is a noise and a sha-
king" among the dry bones. The dust is all alive, and

in motion, and the globe breaks and trembles, as with‘

an earthquake, while this vast army is working its way
through, and bursting into life. ‘The ruins of human
bodies are scattered far and wide, and have passed
through many, and surprising transformations. A limb
in one country, and another in another; here the head,
and there the trunk; and the ocean rolling between‘.
And now, at the sound of the trumpet, they shall all
be collected, wherever they were scattered; all prog-
erly sorted and united, however the were confuse ;
atom to its fellow atom, bone to its fe low bone. Now
methinks you may see the air darkened with fragments

V of bodies, ﬂying from country to country, to meet and

join their proper parts:

“ Scatter’d limbs and all

The various bones obsequious to the call,
Self-mov’d, advance; the neck perhaps to meet
The distant head, the distant legs, the feet.
Dreadful to view, see through the dusky sky
Fragments of bodies in confusion ﬂy, s ‘
To ‘distant regions journeying, there to claim
Deserted members, and complete the frame.

The sever’d head and trunk shall join once more,
Though realms now rise between, and oceans roar.

The trumpet’s sound each vagrant mote shall hear,

Or ﬁx’d in earth, or if aﬂoat. in air,
Obey the signal, wafted in the wind,
And not one sleeping atom lag behind.”

He on his impious foes right onward drove,
Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels

Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent

All coura re; down their idle weapons dropt;
O'er shie ds, and helms, and helmed heads, he rode,
Of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate, '
That wish’d the mountains now might be again
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.

shorten his allowance, till his pride is reduced, and he

Ozno and AMANDAR.

Aman. Am I deluded by a dream? or is this real?
What angel eye of pity has glanced upon us ?

Ozro. I would not interrupt thy bliss, nor stir the
dregs, which the fair surface of this drau ht conceals.
But fortune seems to make our happiness Iier sport.

./Imam. Has not the Bashaw purchased our freedom ?
what are the conditions ? » »

Ozro. That is for time or wildconjecture to deter
mine. We must deliberate what course to take.

ﬂman. What dost thou say ?.let me hear the worst.

Ozro. You know the circumstances of my liberation.
All had the appearance of affability and pity in the Ba-
shaw. He questioned particularly concerning our sit-
uation, and seemed moved with the account I gave.
I informed him, our brother was daily expected with
the gleanings of an unfortunate father’: interest to re-

deem us from our chains, and restore us to a disconso-
late family. He turned aside, as though some sudden
emotion had seized his mind ; then exclaimed,
“ They shall be mine !” The money was paid for your
ransom, and committed to me. We are considered as
his property. ‘

./Jman. What then creates suspicion? This ifavour
has some claim upon our gratitude. If we must err,
let it be on the side of honor. .

Ozro. So thought I, Amandar. These were the
impressions of the moment. But avarice often assumes
the appearance of generosity: and malice, to make its
prey more sure, puts on the guise of pity. If the Ba-
shaw’s motive were our happiness, all, but my freedom,
I would pledge to pay the debt of gratitude. But I
would sooner seek the lion’s den, or trust the mercy of
a tiger, than commit myself to a mercenary Turk. A
father’s fortune well may tempt the hypocritic show
of kindness to his sons.

ﬂman. This thought gives weight to your suspicion.
Are our misfortunes then the object of base specula-
tion? This well becomes the dignity of rulers; the
honor of the prime magistrate of Tunis! To seek us
out, like brutes, to buy and sell, and ﬁll his coffers on
the ruins of our family. But stay. Is there no room

‘for charity? Tunis, of all the states of Barbary, is

famed forits refinement. Every Turk is not an Oran.
l think I have heard the Bashaw noted for his humanity.
Ozro. That ruler has but an ill title to humanity,
who sutfers his subjects to tralfic in the dearest rights
of man, and shares himself the execrated commerce.
./Iman. True, my brother. But let us remember
our native Venice. We have seen the Turk sold there
in openvmarket, and exposed to all the indignities
which we have borne with Oran. Nay more; we
may come nearer home, and spread the blush on our
own faces. VVe both have heard the story of the
grateful Turk, who, by the intercession of Francisco,
was twice released from servitude. He had a noble

106 THE COLUMBIAN, ORATOR.

soul, a feeling heart. Though his virtues were discov-
ered, and ﬁnally rewarded by our father, we may blush
that they were so long unheeded by our countrymen,
and he suffered to languish in ignominious bondage.

Ozro. ‘Your words have weight. For the sake of
this noble captive, I will take part of my censure from
the Turks, and spare it for my countrymen. Though
this was done before my memory, the story paints his
virtues to my mind; and had I no other claim, I would
call Francisco brother for this deed.

./Imam [After a pause.] Can .it be ! no ; ’tis too
much to think of.

Ozro. What, Amandar? «

ﬂman. A thought has struck my mind. Help to
conﬁrm, or to confute it. ‘

Enter Guards abruptly.

Ozro. [Drawing] Who is here.‘ Stand oi?!

Ist. Guard. But look, my lads! you see you are

Ozro. On what conditions must we go ?

Isl. Guard. As to that, we shall not be nice. We
have no cavalry, you see ; so you must be content to
march on foot. You may take the front, or centre,
as suits you best. But we shall not trust you in the

-rear, if you show a dis osition to desert us; and, if

you are inclined to be ostile, we must secure that
sword. *

slaves or freeman?

bind you. If you are not free to go, we must quicken

And, indeed, if he had not judged this higl1>ii("3”

sary for an orator, the would scarcely have taken so
much pains in correcting those natural defects, under
which he laboured at ﬁrst, in order toyacquire it. For
he had both a weak voice, and likewise an impediment
in his speech, so that he could not pronounce distinctly
some particular letters. The formertof which defects
he conquered, partly by speaking as loud as he could
upon the shore, when the sea roared and was boister-
ous; and partly by pronouncing long periods as he
walked up hill; both of which methods contributed"
to strengthen his voice. And hefound means to tren.
der his pronunciation“ more clear and articulate, byrthe
help of some little stones put under his tongue. Nor
was he less careful in endeavouring to gain the habit
of a becoming and decent‘ gesture ; for which purpose
he used to pronounce his discourses alone before a large
glass. And because he had an ill custom of drawing

   

up his shoulders when h.e spoke, to amend that, he

used“ to ‘place them under asword, which hung over
him with the point doWnward._ V e _. g 7 - , ‘ ~
Such pains did this prince of the"Gre’cian orators takes
to remove thosadifﬁculties, which would have been
suﬁ‘icient.to discourage an inferior, and less aspiring
genius.. And to‘ho'w great a perfection he‘ arrived in
his action, under all these disadvantages, by his inde-
fatigable diligence and application, is_c_e_vident from the
confession of his great adversaryand rival in oratory,
Eschines ; Who, when he could not bear the‘ disgrace told

hear that of Demosthenes; which‘, having pronounicedi

nient what our compositions are, as how they are pro-
nounced; since it is the manner of the delivery, by
which the audience is moved.” _

“ The truth of this sentiment of the ancients, concern-
ing the power and eﬁicacy of pronunciation, might be
proved from many instances ; but one or two may here
suﬁice. Hortensius, a cotemporary with Cicero, and
while living, next to him in reputation as an orator,
was highly applauded for his action. But his orations
after his death, as Quintilian tells us, did not appear
answerable to his character; from whence he justly
concludes, there must have been something pleasing
when ‘ he spoke, by which he gained his character,
which was lost in reading them.

But perhaps there is scarcely a more considerable in-
stance of this than in Cicero himself. After the death

of Pompey, when Cesar had gotten the government

into his own hands, many of his acquaintance interce-
ded with him in behalf of their relations and friends,
who had been of the contrary party in the late wars.
Among others, Cicero solicited for his friend Ligarius;
which, Tubero understanding, who owed Ligarius a
grudge, opposed; and undertook to represent him to
Cesar as unworthy of his mercy. Cesar himself was
prejudiced against Ligarius; andtherefore, when the
cause was come before him, he said, “ We may
venture to hear Cicero display his eloquence; forl
know the person he pleads for to be an ill II13.11,.aIl(l
my enemy.” _ _ _ _

But, however, in the course of his oration, Cicero so
wrought upon his passions, that by the frequent altera-

tion in his countenance, the emotions of his mind were “

very conspicuous. And when he came to touch upon
the battle of Pharsalia, which had given Cesar the em-
pire of the world, he represented it in such a moving
and lively manner, that Cesar could no longer contain
himself, but was thrown into such a ﬁt~of shiverin ,
that he dropped the papers which he held in his hand.
This was the more remarkable, because Cesar was him-

toil, an made that servitude a pleasure, which other-
wise had been intolerable. But the generosity “of your

GOCIATING WITH SPAIN.

MY Loans,
I HAVE taken a wide circuit, and trespassed, I fear,
too long upon your patience. Yet I cannot con—
clude without endeavouring to bring home your
thou hts to an object more immediately interestiiig to

us, t an any Ihave yet considered: I mean the in—

ternal condition of this country. We ma ‘look abroad
for wealth, or triumphs, or luxury; ut England,
my lords, is the main stay, the last resort of the
whole empire. To this point, every scheme of policy,
Whether foreign or domestic, should ultimately refer.
Have any measures been taken to satisfy, or to
unite the people? Are the grievances they have so
long complained of remove ? or do they stand not
only unredressed, but aggravated? Is the right of free
election restored to the elective body? My lords, I
myself am one of the people. I esteem that security
and independence, which is the original birthright of
an Englishman, far beyond the privileges, however
splendid, which are annexed to the peera e. I my»

self am’br birth an English elector, an join with

the freeho ders of England as in a common cause.
Believe me, my lords, we mistake our real interest as
much as our duty, when we separate ourselves from
the mass of the people.

Can it be expected that Englishmen will unite heart-
ily in defence of a government, by which they feel them-‘
selves insulted and oppressed? Restore them to their

IEZO THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

rights; that is the true way to make them unanimous.
It is not a ceremonious recommendation from the throne,
that can bring back peace and harmony to a discontent-
ed people. That insipid annual opiate has been ad-
ministered so long, that it has lost its ellect. Some-
thing substantial, something eil"ectual must be done.
The public creditof the nation stands next in degree
to the rights of the constitution; it calls loudly for the
interposition of Parliament. There is a set of men,
my lords, in the city of London, who are known to
live in riot and luxury, u on the plunder of the igno-
rant, the innocent, the he pless; upon that part of the
community, which stands most in need of, and best de-
serves the care and protection of the legislature. To
me, my lords, whether they be miserable jobbers

_ of Exchange Alley, or the lofty Asiatic lunderers of

Leadenhall-street, they are all equally etestable. l
care but little whether a man walks on foot, or is
drawn by eight or six horses. If his luxury be sup-
ported by the plunder of his country, I despise and
detest him.

My lords, while I had the honor of serving his Maj-
esty, I never ventured to look at the treasury but at
a distance; it is a business lam unﬁt for, and to which
lnever could have submitted. The little lknow of
it has not served to raise my opinion of what is vul-
garly called the monicd interest; I mean that blood-
sucker, that muckworm, which calls itself the friend
of government: that pretends to serve this or that ad-
ministration, and may be urchased, on the same terms,
by any administration; at advances money to gov-
ernment, and takes special care of its own emoluments.

I hope, my lords, that nothing I have said will be
understood to extend to the honest, industrious trades-
men, who holds the middle rank, and has given re-

eated proofs, that he prefers law and liberty to gold.
love that class of men. Much less would I be thought
to reflect upon the fair merchant, whose liberal com-

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 121

merce is the prime source‘ of national Wealth. I esteem
his occupation, and respect his character. .

My lords, if the general representation, which I
have had the honor to lay before you, of the situation
of public afi‘-airs, has in any measure engaged your at-
tention, your lordships, lam sure, will agree with me,
that the season calls for more tliancomrnon prudence
and vigour in the direction of your councils. The dif-
ficulty of the crisis demands a wise, a firm, and a pop-

ular administration. The dishonorable traﬁic of places‘

has engaged us too long. Upon this subject, my lords,
I speak without interest or enmity. l have no personal
objection to any of the king’s servants. I shall never
be minister; certainly, not without full power to cut
away all the rotten branches of government. Yet, un-
concerned as I truly am for myself, I cannot avoid see-
ing some capital errors in the distribution of the royal

i favour.

I know I shall be accused of attemptin to revive
distinctions. ‘ My lords, if it were possib e, I would
abolish all distinctions. I would not wish the favours
of the crown to flow invariably in one channel. But
there are some distinctions which are inherent in the
nature of thin . There is a distinction between right
and Wren ; etween whi and tory. , d

When speak of an a ministration, such as the ne-
cessity of the season calls for, my views are large and

com rehensive. It must be ular, that it ma be in
P POP Y S

with reputation. It must be strong within itself, that it
may proceed with vigour and decision. An adminis-
tration, formed upon an exclusive system of family con-
nexions, or private friendships, cannot, I am convinced,
belong supported in this country.

I shall trouble your lordships with but a few words

more. His Majesty tells us in his speech, that he will
call upon us for our advice,_ if it should be necessary in
the farther progress of this affair. It is not easy to say»
whether or not the ministry are serious in this deals»

ration; ncr what is meant by the progress of an affair,
I 1

4 promise. Let me warn them of their

which rests upon one fixed point. Hitherto we have
not been called upon. But though we are not consulted,
it is our right and duty, as the king’s great hereditary
council, to qfer him our advice. The papers, men-
tioned in the noble Duke’s motion, will enable us to
form a just and accurate opinion of the conduct of his.
Majesty’s servants, though not of the actual state of
their honorable negociations.

The ministry, too, seem to want advice upon some
points, in which their own safety is immediately con-
cerned. They ate now balancing between a war,
which they ought to have foreseen, but for which
they have made no provision, and an i norninious com-

dart er. ‘if they
are forced into a war, they stand it att e hazard of
their heads. If, by an ignominious compromise, they
should stain the honor of the crown, or sacriﬁce the
rights of the people, let them look to their consciences,
and consider whether they will be able to walk the
streets in safety.

AM accused of corrupting the youth, and of instill-

ing dangerous principles into them, as well in re-
gard to the worship of the gods, as the rulers of gov-

profession to teach; nor can envy, however violent
against me, reproach me with having everlsold my in-
structions. I have an undeniable evidence for me in
this respect, which is my overty. Always equall
ready to communicate my t oughts either to the ric
or poor, and to give them entire leisure to question or
answer me, I lend, myself to every one who is desirous
of becoming virtuous; and if amongst those who hear
me, there are any who prove either good or bad, nei-
ther the virtues of the one, nor the vices of the other,

tokwhichl have not contributed, are to be ascribed
to me. .. _ a

My whole employment IS to persuade the young
and old against too much love for the body, for riches,
and all other precarious things of whatsoever nature
they be, and against too littleregard for the soul, which
ought to be the object of their affection. For I inces-
santly urge to you, that virtue does not proceed from
riches, but on the contrary, riches from virtue ; and that
all the other goods of human life, as well fl)
private, have their source in the same princip .

If to speak in this manner be to corrupt youth, I
confess, Athenians, thatl am guilty, and deserve to be

"punished. If what I say be not true, it is most easy

to convict me of my falsehood. I see here. a great
number of my disciples: they have only toappear.
But perhaps the reserve and consideration for a master,
who has instructed them, will prevent them from de-
claring against me : at least their fathers, brothers, and
uncles cannot, as good relations and good citizens, dis-
pense with their not standing forth to demand ven-
geance against the corrupter of their sons, brothers,
and nephews. » Butethese are the persons who take

 upon them my defence, and interest themselves in the

success of my cause. . A

Pass on me what sentence you please, Athenians;
but ‘I can neither repent 1101' change my conduct. I
must not abandon or suspend a function, which God
himself has imposed on me, since he has. charged me
with the care of instructing my fellow-citizens. If,
after having faithfully kept all-the ports, wherein I
was placed by ourgenerals, the fear of death should
at this time make me abandon that in _which the Divine
Providence has placed me, by commanding “me to pass
mylife in the study of philosophy, for the instruction
of myself and others; this would be a most criminal
desertion indeed, and make me highly worthy of being
cited before this tribunal, as an impious man who -does
not believe the gods.

, Should you ‘resolve to acquit me for the future,I
should not hesitate to make answer, Athenians, I honor
and love youybut I shall‘ choose rather to obey God
than you -; and to my latest breath shall never renounce

my philosophy, nor cease to exhort and reprove you ~

according tomy custom. 7-I‘ am r-eproached with abject
, fear and meanness of spirit, for being‘ so busy in im-
parting my advice to every one in private, and ‘for
having always avoided to be present in your assemblies,
to I've my counsels to my country. Ithink I have
~ su ciently proved my courage and fortitude, both in

the ﬁeld, where I have borne arms with you, and in the e

' Senate, whenl alone, upon more than one occasion,
.opp.osed the violent. and cruel /ordersvof the thirty ty-
rants. What is it then that has prevented me from ap-
pearing in your assemblies? It is that demon, that
voice divine, which you have so often heard me men-
tion, and Melitus has taken so much pains to ridicule.
That spirit has attached itself to me from my infancy ;

It is a voice, which I never hear, ,but when it would
prevent -me from persisting in something I have resolved ;
for it n.ever exhorts me to undertake any thing. It is
ﬂthesame being that has always opposed me, when I
would have intermeddled in the affairs of the republic;
and that with the greatest reason; for I should have
been amongst the dead long ago, had I been concerned

a in the measures of the state, without effecting any thing

to the advantage of myself, or our country.

Do not take it ‘ill, I beseech‘ you, if I speak my
thoughts without disguise, and with truth and freedom.
Every man who would generously oppose a whole peo-

ple, either amongst us or elsewhere. and who inﬂexibly V

-applies himself to prevent the violation of the laws, and
the practice of iniquity. in a government, will never do
so. long. with impunity. It is absolutely necessary for
him, who would contend for justice, if he has any

thoughts of living, to remain in a private station, and.

a never to ‘have any share in public affairs.

For the rest, Athenians, if, in the extreme danger I
now am, I do not imitate the behaviour of those, who,

upon less emergencies, have implored and supplicated ‘

their judges with tears, and have brought forth their
children, relations, and friends, it is not through pride
or obstinacy, or any contempt for you; but solely for
your honor, and for that of the whole city. Atmy
ago, and with the reputation, true or false,xt*hicl1I
have, would it be C0nSlSt€I1t_fOI‘ me, after all the les-
sons I have given upon the contempt of death, to be
afraid of it myself, and to belie in my last action all the
principles and sentiments of my past life ?

But Without speaking of my fame, which_I should
extremely injure by ‘such a conduct, I do not think it
allowable to entreat a. judge, nor to be absolved by sup-

lications : he ought to be " persuaded and convinced.
he 'udge does not sit -upon the bench to show favour
by violating the laws; but to do justice’ in conforming
to them. He does not swear to discharge with impu-

‘nity whom he pleases; but to do justice where it is

due. We ought not therefore to accustom you to
perjury. nor you to suller yourselves to be accustomed
to it; for in so doing, both the one and the other of
us equally injure justice and religion, and ‘both are
criminals. _‘

Do not "therefore expect from me, Athenians, that
I should have recourse to means which I believe nei-
ther honest nor lawful; especially upon this occasion,
wherein I am accused of impiety by Melitus. For,
if I should inﬂuence you by my prayers, and thereby
induce you to violate your oaths, it would be unde-
niably evident, thatl teach you not to believe in the
gods; and even in defending and justifying myself,
should furnish rn adversaries with arms atrainst me,
and prove that I‘ believe no divinity. Butl am very
far from such wicked thoughts. I am more convinced
of the existence of God than my accusers ; and so con-
vinced,’ that I abandon myself to God and you, that
you may judge of me as* you shall think it best.

self one of the greatest orators of that age ; knew all
the arts of address, and avenues to the passions; and con-
sequently was better prepared to guard against them.
But neither his skill, nor resolution of mind, was of
sufficient force against the power of oratory; but the
conqu eror of the world became a conquest to the charms
of Cicero’s eloquence; so that, contrary to his inten-
tion, he pardoned Ligarius. Now that oration is still
extant, and appears exceedingly well calculated to
touch the soft and tender passions and springs of the

soul; but we believe it can scarcely be discernible to ’

any, in reading it, how it should have had so surprising
an effect; which must therefore have been chiefly ow-
ing to the wonderful address of the speaker. '

The more natural the pronunciation is, the more_

moving it will be; since the perfection of art consists
in its nearest resemblance to nature. And therefore
it is not without good reason, that the ancients make

it one qualiﬁcation of an orator, that he be agood man ;~

because a person of this character will make the cause
he espouseshis own; and the more sensibly he is
touched with it himself, the more natural will be his
action; and, of course, the more easily will he affect
others. Cicero says, “ It is certain that truth (by
which he means nature) in every thing excels imita-
tion ; but if that were sufficient of itself in action, we
should have ‘no occasion for art.”

In his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better
judge ?) art, in this case, as well as in many others, if
well managed, will assist and improve nature. But this
is not all; for sometimes we find the force of it so great
and powerful, that, where it is wholly counterfeit,‘it
will for the time work the same effect as if it were
founded in truth. This is well known to those who
have been conversant with the representations of the
theatre. ln tragedies, though we are sensible that
every thing We see and hear is counterfeit; yet such is
the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by
it in the same manner as if it were all reality. I

that he had alone sur rised a whole regiment and cut
them in pieces; and t at all the army stood in awe of
him.

Trusty. Well, you may depend on what I tell you:
and the one that sits next to him is a bankrupt, who
has been guilty of every shameful practice to defraud
his creditors; and the other is a base pawn-broker,
who has got all the property of this bankrupt in his
hands for concealment.

you call him, was just now telling the other, how he
was afraid the late storms at sea mi‘ ht atfect his ship-

‘ MR. Sm:’n1nAN’s SPEECH AGAINST Mn. TAYLOR.

WE have this day been honored with the coun.
sels of a complete gradation of lawyers. We
have received the opinion of a Judge, of an Attorney-
General, of an Ex-Attorney-General, and of a ‘prac.
tising Barrister. I agree with the learned entleman
in his admiration of the abilities of my onorable
friend, Mr. Fox. What he has said of his quickness
and of his profoundness, of his boldness and his candor,
is literally just and true, which the mental accomplish-
ment of my honorable friend is, on every occasion, cal-
culated to extort even from his adversaries.

The learned gentleman has, however, in this insidi-
ous eulogium, connected such qualities of mind with
those he has praised and venerated, as to convert his
encomiums into reproach, and his tributes of praise in-
to censure and invective. The boldness he has de-
scribed is only craft, and his candor, hypocrisy. Upon
what , rounds does thenlearned gentleman connect those
assenihlages of great qualities and of cardinal defects?
Upon what princi les,either ofjustice orof equity,does
he exult with one liand, whilst he insidiously reprobates
and destroys with the other ? i

If the wolf is to be feared, the learned gentleman
may rest assured, it will be the wolf in shcep’s clothing,
the masked pretender to patriotism. . It is not from the
fang of the lion, but from the tooth of the serpent,
that reptile which insidiously steals upon the Vitals ofthe
constitution, and gnaws it to the heart, ere the mis-
chief is suspected, that destruction is to be feared.

With regard to the acquisition of a learned gentle-
man, Mr. Taylor, who has declared that he means to
vote with us this day,-I am sorry to acknowledge, that
from the declaration he has made at the beginning of
his speech, I see no great reason to boast of such an
auxiliary. The learned gentleman, who has with pe-

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 131

ouliat modesty styled himself a chicken lawyer-,has de-
clared, that, thinking us in the right with respect to
the subject of this day’s discussion, he shall vote with
us ; but he has at the same time thought it necessar-
to assert, that he has never before voted diﬂ"erentIy
from the minister and his friends, and perhaps he never
shal} again vote. with those whom he means to support
this day. . s

It is rather singular to vote with us, professedly be-
cause he ﬁnds us to be in the right, and, in the vcr ,_
moment that he assigns so good areason for changing his

side, to declare, that in all probability he never shall

vote with us again. I am sorry to ﬁnd thechicken is

a bird of ill omen, and that its augury is, so unpropi-

tious to our future interests. Perhaps it would have
been‘ as well, under these circumstances, that the chick-
en had not left the barn-door of the treasury; but
continued side byside with the old cock, to pick those
crumbs of comfort which would doubtless be dealt out
in time, with a liberality proportionate to the ﬁdelity
of the feathered tribe.

ripening rage and insolence, has now broken ,out clu-

alone be removed from this powerful band of traitors,

while ; but the danger will still. remain, and continue

water ; but afterwards ﬁnd the disease return upon them
with redoubled fury; in like manner, this distemper,

» which has seized the commonwealth, eased a little by

the punishment of this traitor, will, from his surviving
associates, soon assume new force. Wherefore, con-
script fathers, let the wicked retire; let them sepa-
rate themselves from the honest; let them rendezvous
in one place. In fine, as I have often said, let a wall
be between them and us ; let them cease to lay snares
for the consul in his own house ; to beset the tribunal
of the cit prtetor; to invest the senate-house with
armed ru ians,and to prepare ﬁre-balls and torches for
burning the city : in short, let every man’s sentiments
with regard to the public be inscribed on his forehead.
This I engage for, and promise, conscript fathers,
that by the diligence of the consuls, the weight of your
authority, the courage and ﬁrmness of the Roman
knights, and the unanimity of all the honest, Catiline
being driven from the city, ym shall behold all his
treasons detected, exposed, crushed, and punished.
With these omens, Catiline, of all rosperit to the
republic, but of destruction to thyse f, and al those
who have joined themselves with thee in all kinds of
arrieide, go thy way then to this impious and abom-
inable war: whilst thou, Jupiter, whose reli ion was
established with the foundation of this city, w om we
truly call Stator, the stay and prop of this empire, wilt
drive this man and his accom liees from thy altars and
tem les, from the houses andpwalls of the city, from
the ives and fortunes of us all ; and wilt destroy with
eternal punishments, both living and dead, all the
haters of good men, the enemies of their country, the

pltmderers of Italy, new confederated in this detesta-

le league and partnership of villany.

COLUMBUS look’d; and still around them‘ spread,
' From south to north, th’ immeasurable shade;
At last, the central shadows burst away,

And rising regions open’d on the day.

He saw, once more, bright Del’ware’s silver stream,
And Penn’s throng’d city cast a cheerful gleam ;

The dome of state, that met his eager eye,

_NoW heav’d its arches in a loftier sky.

The bursting gates unfold: and 10, within,

A solemn train, in conscious glory, shine.’

The well—known/forms his eye had trac’d before,

In diﬂ’rent realms along th’ extended shore;

Here, grac’d with nobler fame, and rob’d in state,

They look’d and mov’d magniﬁcently eat.
High on the foremost seat, in living i ht,

Majestic Randolph caught the hero’s sig t:

Fair_on his head, the civic crown was plac’d,

And the ﬁrst dignity his sceptre grac’d.

He opes the cause, and points in prospect far,

Through all the toils that Wait th’ impending war,

/But, hapless sage, thy reign must soon be o’er,

To lend thy lustre, and to shine no more.

So the bright morning star, from shades of ev’n,
Leads up the dawn, and lights the front of heaV’n,
Points to the waking world the sun’s broad Way,
Then veils his own, and shines above the day.‘
And see great Washington behind thee rise, V
Thy following sun, to gild our morning skies;
O’er shadowy climes to pour th’ en.liv’ning'ﬂame,
The charms of freedom and the ﬁre of fame.

Th’ ascending chief adorn’d his splendid seat,
Like Randolph, ensign’d with a crown of state, V
Where the green patriot bay beheld, with pride,
The hero’s laurel “springing by its side; '
His sword hung useless, (it; his graceful thigh.

SPEECH or BUONAPARTE, COMMANDER IN CHIEF or
THE FRENCH ARMY IN ITALY, To His BRETHREN
IN ARMS.

SOLDIERS,

YOU are precipitated like a torrent from the

heights of the Appenines; you have overthrown
and dispersed all that dared to oppose your march.
Piedmont, rescued from Austrian t ranny, is left to its
natural sentiments of regard and friendship to the
French. ~ Milan is ours; and the republican standard
is displayed throng out all Lombardyw The dukes of
Parma and Modena are indebted for their political ex-
istence only to your generosity.

The army, which so proudly menaced you, has had
no other barrier than its dissolution to oppose your in-
vincible courage. The Po, the T essen, the Adda, could
not retard you a single day. - The vaunted bulwarks
of Italy were insufficient. You swept them with the

same rapidity that you did the Appenines. Those suc-

cesses have carried joy into the bosom of your country.
Your representatives decreed a festival dedicated to your
‘victories, and to be celebrated throughout all the com~’
munes of the republic. Now your fathers, your moth-
ers, your wives, and our sisters, will rejoice in your
success, and take pl‘l(l:3 in their relation to you.

Yes, soldiers, you have done much; but more still
remains for you to do. Shall it be said of us, that we
know how to conquer, but not to proﬁt by our victo-
ries? Shall posterity reproach us with having found a
Capua in Lombardy? But already I see you ﬂy to
arms. You are fatigued with an inactive repose. You

’ lament the days that are lost to your glory! Well,

1 36 THE CQLUMBIAN ORATOR.

then, let us proceed; weihave other forced marches to
make, other enemies, to subdue; more laurels to ac-
uire, and more injuries to avenge.

, Let thoserwho have unsheathed the daggers of civil
éwar in France; who have basely assassinated our min-
isters; who have burnt our ships at Toulon; let them
tremble! the knell of ven eance has already tolled!

But to quiet the apprelgiensions of the people, we
declare ourselves the friends of all, and particularly of
those who are the descendants of Brutus, of Scipio,
and those other great men whornwe have taken for
our models. ’

To re-establish the capital; to replace the statues
of those heroes who have rendered it immortal; to
rouse the Roman people entranced in so many ages of
slavery; this shall be the fruit of your victories. It
will be an epoch for the admiration of posterity; you
will enjoy the immortal glory of changing the aspect
of affairs in the finest part of Europe. The free peo-
ple of France, not regardless of moderation, shall accord
to Europe a glorious peace; butit will indemnify
itself for the sacriﬁces of ever kind which it has been
making for six years past. Yyou will again be restored
to your ﬁre-sides and homes; and your fellow-citizens,

omting you out, shall say, “ There goes one ‘who
elonged to the army of Italy!”

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. I1

Anger and resentment at the appearance of cruelty,
concern and solicitude for distressed virtue, rise in our
breasts; and tears are extorted from us for oppressed
innocence: though at the same time, perhaps, we are
ready to laugh at ourselves for being thus decoyed. lf
art then has so great an inﬂuence upon us, when sup-
ported by fancy and imagination only, how powerful
must be the eilect of ajust and lively representation of
what we know to be true.

How agreeable it is, both to nature and reason, that a
warmth of expression and vehernency of motion should
rise in proportion to the importance of the subject, and
concern of the speaker, will further appear by looking
back a little into the more early and simple ages of the
world. For the higher we go, the more we shall find
of both. The Romans had a very great talent this
way, and the Greeks a greater. The eastern nations
excelled in it, and particularly the Hebrews.

Nothing can equal the strength and vivacity of the
ﬁgures they employed in their discourse, and the very
actions they used, to express their sentiments ;‘such as
putting ashes on their heads, tearing their garments,

and covering themselves with sackcloth under any deep‘

distress and sorrow of mind. And hence, ‘no doubt,
arose those surprising elfects of eloquence, which we
never experience new. I

And what is said here, with respect to the action of
the eastern nations, was in a good measure customary
amon the Greeks and Romans; if not entirely ofthe
same iind, yet perhaps as vehement and expressive.

They did not think language of itselfsufﬁcient to ex-
press the height ot their passions, unless enforced by
uncommon motions and gestures. Thus, when Achil-
ics had driven the Trojans into their city with the
greatest precipitation and terror, and only Hector ven-
tured to tarry without the gates to engage him, Homer
represents both king Priam and his queen under the
highest consternation for the danger of their son. And
therefore, in order to prevail with him to come into the

gl3oubtless it would have pierced one’s heart, to have
behold the tender parents followinv the breathless
youth to his long home. Perhaps, drowned in tears,
and all overwhelmed with sorrows, they stood, like
weeping Statues, on this very spot. Methinks Isee
the deeply-distressed mourners attending the sad solem-
nity. How they wring their hands, and our forth
ﬂoods from their eyes‘ Is it fancy? or o I really

Dumb she remained, while the awful obsequies were

‘struggles for vent; it grows too big to be re ressed.

She advances to the brink of the grave. All er soul
is in her eyes. She fastens one more look upon the
dear doleful object, before the pit shuts its mouth upon
him. And as she looks, she cries; in broken accents,
interrupted by many a rising sob, she cries, Farewell,
my son! my son! my only beloved! would to God I
had died for thee! Farewell, my child! and farewell all
earthly happiness! I shall never more see good in the
land of the living. Attempt not to comfort me. I
will go mourning all my days, till my grey hairs come
down with sorrow to the grave.

SPEECH or CA1Us»CAss1us TO HIS COLLECTED
Fences, AFTER THE DEA'rH or CESAR.

Sonnmas AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,

THE unjust reproaches of our enemies we could
easily disprove, if we were not, by our numbers,
and by the swords which we hold in our hands, in con-
dition to despise them. While Cesar led the armies of
the republic against the enemies of Rome, we took
part in the same service with him; we obeyed him;
we Were happy to serve under his command. But
when he declared war a rainst the commonwealth, we
became his enemies ; and when he became an usurper
and a tyrant, ~we resented, as an injury, even the fa-
vours which he presumed to bestow upon ourselves.
Had he been to fall a sacriﬁce to private resentment,
we should not have been the proper actors in the exe-
cution of the sentence against him. He was willing to
have indulged us with preferments and honours; but,
we were not willin to accept, as the gift of a master,
what We were entit ed to claimas free citizens. We
conceived, that, in presuming to confer the honors of
the Roman Republic, he encroached on the prerogatives
of the Roman people, and insulted the authority of
the Roman senate. Cesar cancelled the laws, and over-
turned the constitution of his country; he usurped all
the powers of the commonwealth, set up a monarchy,
and himself affected to be a king. This our ancestors,
at the expulsion of Tarquin, bound themselves and
their posterity, by the most solemn oaths, and by the
most direfuli-mprecations, never to endure. The same
obligation has been entailed upon us as a debt by our
fathers ; and we, having faithfully paid and discharged

THE COLUMBIAN ORATORQ 143

it, have performed the oath, and averted the conse-
quences of failure from ourselves, and from our P05-
terity. ,

In the station of soldiers, we might havecommitted
ourselves, without reflection, to the command of an
officer, whose abilities and whose valour we admired;
but, in the character of.Roman citizens, we have a far
different part to sustain. Imust suppose, that I now
speak to the Roman people, and to citizens. of a free
republic; to men who have never learned to depend
upon others for gratiﬁcations and favours ; who are not
accustomed to own a superior, but who are. themselves

the masters, the dispensers of fortune and of honor,
and the givers of all those dignities and powers by

which Cesar himself was exalted, and of which he as-
sumed the entire disposal. ’ ‘

Recollect from whom the Scipios, the Pompeys, and
even Cesar himself derived his honors; from your an-
cestorsgywhom you now represent, and from yourselves,
to whom, according to the laws of the republic, we,
who are now your leaders in the ﬁeld, address ourselves
as your fellow-citizens in the commonwealth, and as
persons depending on your pleasure for the just reward
and retribution of our servicfes. Happy in being able
to restore to you what Cesar had the resumption to
appropriate to himself, the power an the dignity of
your fathers, with the supreme disposal of all the of-
ﬁces of trust that were established for your safety, and
for the preservation of your freedom; happy in being
able to restore to the tribunes of the Roman people the
power of protecting you, and of procuring to every
Roman éitizen that justice, which, under the late usur-
pation of Cesar, was withheld, even from the sacred
persons of those magistrates themselves.

An usurper is the common enemy of all good citizens ;
but the task of removing him could be the business only
of a few. The senate and the Roman people, as soon
as it was proper for them to declareitheir judgment,
pronounced their approbation of those who were con-

144 THE COLUMBIAN onxron.

cerned in the death of Cesar, by the rewards and the
honors which they bestowed upon them ; and they are
now become a prey to assassins and murderers; they
bleed in the streets, in the temples, in the most secret
retreats, and in the arms of their families ; or they are
dispersed, and fly wherever they hope to escape the
fury of their enemies.

Many are now present before you, happy in your
protection, happy in witnessing the zeal which you on.
tertain for the commonwealth, for the rights of your
fellow-citizens, and for your own. These respectable
citizens, we trust, will soon, by your means, be restor-
ed to a condition in which they can enjoy, together
with you, all the honors ofa free people; concur with
you, in bestowing, and partake with you in receiving,
the rewards which are due to such eminent services as
you are now engaged to perform.

Ma. SPEAKER,

IT becomes us to learn, not from the minister, but
from the throne itself, whether this country is to
be governed by men, in whom the House of Commons
can confide, or whether we, the people of England’s
Representatives, are to be the sport and foot-ball of any
junto that may hope to rule over us, by an unseen and
unexplomble principle of government, utterly unknown
to the Constitution. This is the great question, to
which every public-spirited citizen of this country
should direct his view. A (uestion which goes very

and legislative , authority, at a time when they are
pointingrwith equal vigour, unity, and effect, to the
common interests of the nation ‘.7

“It is good,” said Jeremiah, “for a man to bear
the yoke in his youth ;” and if the Right Honorable
Gentleman had attended to this maxim,‘ he would not,
at so early 3. period, have declared against a subordi-
Iiate situation; but would have lent the aid of his fac-
ulties to carry on the allairs of this country, which
wanted nothing but stability to render them glorious,
instead of setting up at once for himself to be the ilI‘Sl.

How very diterent has been the progress of my
honorable friend, who sits near me; w 0 was not
hatched at once into a minister, byithe hﬁat of his own
ambition; but who, as it was goo or .1111" to 0. In
the words of the rophet, “. bore the yoke in his youth ;_”
passed throught e subordinate ofiic_e.s,andma_tu_red his
talents, in long and laborious oppositions ; arriving, by
the natural progress of his powerful mind, _to a supe-
riority of political wisdom and comprehension, which
this House had long, with delight and satisfaction, ac-
lcnowled ed.

To plgck such a man from the councils of his coun-
try in the hour of her distresses, while he enjoyed the
fix l conﬁdence of the House, to give effect to vigorous
plans for her interest; and to throw every thing into
confusion, by the introduction of other men, introdu-
ced, as it should seem, for no other purpose than to
beget that confusion, is an evil, which, if we cannot
rectify, we may at least have leave to lament.

,Tliese evils are, however, im uted, by the“ Right
Honorable Gentleman and his colleagues, to another
source; to the bill for the re ulation of the East-ln-
dies; from the mischiefs of w ich they had stepped
forth to save the country; a language most indecent
in this House of Commons, which thought it their duty
to the: tiblic to pass it bya majority of abovefone hun-
dred; gatit which was, however, to be taken to be de-

n striictive and dangerous, notwithstanding that author-

vity: because it had been disa roved by a majority of

him from the walls in the most tender and moving lan-
guage imaginable; but they tear oﬂ" their grey locks
with their hands, and adjure him to comply with their
request. V

The poet knew very well, that no Words of them-
selves could represent those agonies ofmind he endeav-
oured to convey, unless heightened by the idea of such
actions as were expressive of the deepest sorrow. In
one of Cicero’s orations, he does not stick to argue in this
manner with his adversary. “ VVould you talk thus
(says he) if you were serious? VVould you, who are
wont to display your eloquence so warmly in the danger
of others, act so coldly in your own? VVhere is that
concern, that ardour which used to extort pity even
from children ?, Here is no emotioneither of mind or
body; neither the forehead struck, nor the thigh;
nor so much as a stamp of the foot. Therefore, you
have been so far from inﬂaming our minds, that you
have scarcely kept us awake.”

The ancients had persons, Whose proper business it
was to teach them how to regulate and manage‘ their
voice; and others, who instructed them in the whole
art of pronunciation, both as to their voice and gestures.
These latter were generally taken from the theatre,
being some eminent experienced actors. But though
they made use of actors to instruct their youth in form-
ing their speech and gestures; yet the action of an or-
ator was very different from that of the theatre.

Cicero very plainly represents this distinction, in the
words of Crassus; when speaking of orators, he says,
“ The motions of the body ought to be suited to the
expressions, not in a theatrical way, mimicking the
words by particular gesticulations; but in a manner
ex ressive of the general sense; with a sedate and manly
inflizction of the sides; not taken from the stage and
actors, but from the exercise of arms ‘and the palestra.”
And Quintilian says to the same purpose, “ Every
gesture and motion of the comedians is not to be imi-

\‘ FRIENDS AND FELLOXV-CITIZENS,

THE period for a new election of a citizen to ad-
minister the executive government of the United
States, being not far distant; and the time actually
arrived, when your thoughts must be employed in de-
signating the person, who is to be clothed with that
important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as
it may conduce to a, more distinct expression of the
public voice, that Ishould now apprise you of the res-
olution I have formed, to decline being considered
among the number of those, out of whom a choice is
to be made.

‘I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to
be assured, that‘ this resolution’ has not been taken,
without a strictregard to all theconsiderations apper-
-taining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to
his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of
service which silence in my situation might imply‘, I
am inﬂuenced by no diminution of zeal for your future
interest; no deﬁciency of grateful respect for your past
kindness; but am supported by a full conviction that
the step is compatible with both. i

The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the

, office to which your suffrages have twice called me,

have been a uniform sacriﬁce of inclination to the opin-

ion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to‘

be your desire. I constantly hoped, that it would have
been much earlier in my power. consistently with mo-

ﬁves, whichyl was not at liberty to disregard, to return
:9 that retirement from which I had been reluctantly
drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this,

revious to the last election, had even led to the prep-
aration of an address to declare it to you ; but mature

reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of

our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous ad-
vicebof gersolps (Entitled to my conﬁdence, impelled me
to a an out ex ea.

I rejoice, that the state of your concerns, external as
well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of incli-
nation incompatible with the sentiment of duty, or pro-
priety; and am persuaded, whatever partiality may be
retained for my services, that in the present circum-
stances of our country, you will not disapprove my
determination to retire.

The impressions, with which I first undertook the
arduous trust, were explainedon the pro or occasion.
In the dischar e of this trust, I will my" say, that I
have with goo intentions contributed towards the or-
ganization and administration of the government, the

est exertions of which a very fallible judgment was
capable. Not unconscious, in the outset, of the infe-
riority of my qualiﬁcations, experience in my own eyes,
perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strength-
ened the motives to dillidence of myself: and every
day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more
and more, that the shade of retirement is as necessary
to me as it will be welcome. Satisﬁed that if any cir-
cumstances have given peculiar value to my services,
they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe
that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the
poittical scene, patriotism does not forbid it.

In looking forward to the moment which is intend-
95 to terminate the career of my public life, my feel-
!!! 8 do not ermit me to. suspend the deep acknowl-

’ ent of at debt of gratitude which I owe to my
he oved country,,for. the many honors it has conferred
“POD me; still more for the stedfastconﬁdence with

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. . 149

which it has supported me; and for the opportunities I
have thence enjoyed of manifesting, my inviolable at-
tachrnent, by services faithful and persevering, though
in usefulness unequal to my zeal. . If beneﬁts have re-
sulted to our country from these services, let it always
be remembered to your praise, as an instructive exam-
ple in our annals, that under circumstances in which
the passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to
mislead ; amidst appearances sometimes dubious ; vicis-
situdes of fortune often discouraging; in situations in
which, not unfrequently, want of success has counte-
nanced the spirit of criticism; the constancy of your

‘support was the essential prop of the eﬁbrts, and a

guarantee of the plans by which they were effected.
Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it
with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceas-
ing vows that Heaven may continue to you the choicest
tokens of its beneﬁcence; that your union and broth-
erly affection may be perpetual; that the free consti-
tution, which is the work of your hands, may be sa-
credly maintained; that its administration in every de-
partment may be stamped with wisdom and virtue;
that, in ﬁne, the happiness of the people of these States,
under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete,

by so careful a preservation and so prudent a..usei of this‘

blessing, as will acquire to them the glory of recom-

I mending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption

of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.

Though in reviewing the incidents of my adminis-
tration, I am unconscious of intentional error; lam
nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it
probable that I may have committed many errors.
Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Al-
mighly to avert or mitigate the evils to which they

- tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my

country will never cease to View them with indulgence ;

and after forty-ﬁve yearsiof my life dedicated to its ser-

vice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent

abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must
soon be to the mansions of rest.

Relying on its kindness in this as in other things;
and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is
so natural to a man who views in it the native soil of
himself and his progenitors for several generations,.l
anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in
which I promise myself to realize, without alloy, the
sweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midst of my fel-
low-citizens, the benign inﬂuence of good laws under
a free government; the ever favorite object of my
heart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual
cares, labors,_and dangers.

studies will soon be completed; and I wish to look a
little forward. What say you? am I right?

Charley. It may be well for you : poor men’s sons
must look out for themselves. My father is ableto sup-
port me at my ease; and my mamma says she would
rather see me laid in a coflin than shut up in a study,
spoiling my eyes and racking my brains, plodding over
your nonsensical minister, doctor, and lawyer books;
and I am sure she would never have me conﬁned behind
a counter, ora merchant’s desk. She intends I shall be
brou ht up a gentleman. My mother is of noble blood,
and sie don’t intend that I shall disgrace it.

Edzo. Pray, master Charley, who was the father of
your noble~blooded mother? '

Edw. Yes, a gentleman cobler, to my knowledge.

Char. Aye, he followed that business, to be sure,
sometimes, to stop the clamour of the vulgar. Then

poor people could not bear to see a rich man living at
his ease, or give a nobleman his title- But times are

altering for the better, my mamma says: the rich be-&

gin to govern now. We shall soon live in style, and
wear titles here as Well as in England. She intends to

send over and get my coat of arms, and she hopes to .

add a title to them. -

Edw. High style! titles! and coats of ‘arms! ﬁne
things in America, to be sure! Well, after all, I can?t
really disapprove of your rnamma’s plan. “A lapstone,
an awl, and shoe-hammer will make a ﬁne‘ picture, and
may appear as well in your mother’s parlour, as in her

‘father’s shop: and the title of cobler, or shoe-maker

woul.d well become her darling Charley. - 

Char. _ I will not be insulted onaccount of my“. Vand-
father’s employment‘,“l’ll have you to know! have
heard my mother say, her father was grandson of an
aunt of ’squire Thorn, -who once had a horse that run

’ a race with the famous horse of a cousin ‘of the Duke

of Bedford, of .
Edw. Quite enough! I am fully convinced of the

 

‘ justice of your claim to the title of Duke, or whatever

you please- About as much merit in it, I perceive, as
in your.father’s title-to his estate. Ten thousand dol-
larsdrawn in a lottery! already two thirds spent. A ’
title to nobility derived from the grandson of an aunt
of ’squire Thorn, from ’squire Thorn’s horse, or per-
haps from some monkey, that has been a favorite play-
mate with the prince of Wales. These are to be the
support of your ease and honor through life. Well, I
believe there is no need of your troubling yourself about
your future employment: that is already determined.
Depend upon it, you will repent of your folly, or scratch
a poor man’s head as long as you live. I advise you
to set about the former, in order to avoid the latter.-
‘Char. ldid not come to you for advice. I’ll not bear
your insults, or disgrace myself with your company any
longer. My parents shall teach you better manners.

Thomas. I pity the vanity and weakness of this poor
lad. But reflection and experience will teach him the
fallacy of his hopes.

Edw. Poor child; he does not know that his lot-
tery money is almost gone ; that his father"s house is
mortgaged for more than it is worth; and that the only
care of his parents is to keep up the appearance of
present grandeur, at the expense of future shame.
Happy for us, that we are not deluded with such de-
ceitful hopes.

Tho. My parents were poor; not proud. They ex-
perienced the want of learning ; but were resolved their
children should share thebeneﬁt of a good education.
lam the fourth son, who owe the debt of ﬁlial gratitude.
All but myself are well settled in business, and doing
honor to themselves and their parents. If I fall short
of their example, I shall be most ungrateful.

Edw. I have neither father nor mother to excite my
ratitude, or stimulate my exertions. But I wish to
ehave in such a manner, that if my parents could look

down and observe my actions, they might approve my
conduct. Of my family, neither root nor branch re-
mains: all have paid the debt of nature. They left a
name for honesty; and I esteem that higher than a pre-
tended title to greatness. The have left me a small
farm, which, though not enough for my support, will,
with my own industry, he suﬂicient. For employment,
to pass away the winter season, I have determined upon
keeping a school for my neighbours’ children.

Tho. I heartily approve of your determination.
Our mother Earth rewards, with peace and plenty,
those, who cultivate her face; but loads, with anxious
cares, those, who dig her bowels for treasure. The
life you contemplate is favorable to the enjoyment of
socialhappiness, improvement of the mind, and securi-
ty of virtue; and the task of training the tender mind is
an employment, that ought to meet the encourage-
ment, the ratitude of every parent, and the respect of
every child.

THE FRENCH ARMY IN ITALY, BEFORE ms A-1.
TACK ON MXLAN, Arrur. E26, 1796.

Sonmr-zns,

YOU have in a fortnight gained six victories;
taken twenty-one stands of colours; seventy-one
pieces of cannon; several strong places; conquered
the richest part of Piedmont; you have made ﬁfteen
thousand prisoners, and killed or wounded more than
ten thousand men. You had hitherto fought only for
sterile rocks, rendered illustrious by your courage, but
useless to the country; you have equalled by your ser-
vices the victorious army of Holland and the Rhine.
Deprived of every thing, you have supplied every
thing. You have won battles without cannon; made
forced marches without shoes ; watched without brandy, ‘
and often without bread. The republican phalanxes,
the soldiers of liberty were alone capable of suffering
what you have suffei-ed.

Thanks be to you,~soldiers. The grateful country
will, in part, be indebted to you for her prosperit ;
and if, when victorious at Toulon, you predicted tile
immortal campaign of 1794, your present victories will
befthe presages of more brilliant victories. The two
armies which attacked you with audacity, ﬂy disheart-
ened before you. Men, who smiled at your misery,
and rejoiced in thought at the idea of the triumphs of
your enemies, are confounded and appalled. But it
must not, soldiers, be concealed from you, that you
have done 110!/ting since something remains yet to be
done. Neither 'l‘urin nor Milan are in your power.
The ashes of the conquerors of the Tarquins are still
disgraced by the assassins of Basseville. At the com-
mencement of the campaign you were destitute of ev-
ery thing; now you are amply provided‘; the maga-

Soldiers, the country has a right to expect great
things from you ; justify her expectations. The great.
est obstacles are undoubtedl ' overcome; but you have

still battles to. ﬁght, cities to take, rivers to pass. Is ,
there one among you whose courage is diminished? is‘

there one who would prefer returning to the summits
of the Alps and the Appenines? N0: all burn with

is one condition which you must swear to‘ fulﬁl ; it is
to respect the ‘people Whom you deliver ; to repress

Mr Lonns, .

I AM astonished to hear such princi les confessed!
I am shocked to hear them avowe in this House,
or in this country! Principles, equally unconstitutional,
inhuman, and unchristian!

My lords, I did not intend to have encroached
a ain on your attention ; but I cannot repress my in-
dignation. I feel myself impelled by every duty. My
lords, we are called upon as members of this House,
as men, as Christian men,to protest a ainst such notions
standing near the throne, polluting the ear of Majesty.

“' That God and nature put into our hands!” I know.

not what ideas that lord may entertain of - God and
nature; but I know, that such abominable principles
are equally abhorrent to religion and humanity.
,What! to attribute the sacred sanction of God and
nature to the massacres of the Indian scalping-knife!
to the cannibal savage, torturing, murdering, roasting,
and eatinrr; literally, my lords, eating the mangled
victims Ofﬁ1lS barbarous battles! Such horrible notions
shock every precept of religion, divine or natural, and
every generous feeling of humanity. And, my lords,
they shock every sentiment of honor; they shock me
as a lover of honorable war, and a detester of murder-

‘ ous barbarity. .

These abominable rincigles, and this more abomina-
ble avowal of them, ' eman the most decisive indigna-.

tated, nor to the same degree. They thought the
action of the theatre too light and extravagant for the
imitation of an orator ; and therefore, though they
employed actors to inform young persons in the first
rudiments, yet they were afterwards sent to schools, de-
signed on purpose to teach them a decent and graceful
management of their bodies. -

Being thus far prepared, they were afterwards sent
to the schools of the rhetoricians. And here, as their
business was to cultivate their style, and gain the whole
art of eloquence, so particiilarly to acquire a just and
accurate pronunciation by those exercises, in which for
that end they were constantly employed. Nor, after
all this pains and industry, did they yet think them-
selves sufliciently qualiﬁed to take upon them the char-
acter of orators. But it was their constant custom to
get together some of their friends and acquaintance,
who were proper judges of such performances, and
declaim before‘ them in private.‘ V

The business of these persons was to make observa-
tions both on their language and pronunciation. And
they were allowed the greatest freedom to take notice
of anything thought to be amiss, either as to inaccuracy
of method, impropriety of style, or indecency of their
voice or actions. This gave them an opp_ortunity to
correct any such defects at first, before they became
habitual. What effects might not justly be expected
from such an institution ? Persons trained up in this
manner, with all those advantages, joined to a good
natural genius, could not fail of making very complete

the justice of their country. Ic all upon the bishops
to interpose the unsullied sanctity of their lawn; upon

the honor of your lordships, to reverence the dignity

upon the spirit and humanity of my country, to vindi-\
cate the national character. I invoke the genius of
the constitution.

From the tapestry that adorns these walls, the im-
mortal ancestor of this noble lord frowns with indig-
nation at the disgrace of his country. In vain he led
your victorious ﬂeets against the boasted armada of
Spain ; ‘in vain. he defended and established the honor,
theliberties, the religion, the protestant religion of this
country, against the arbitrary cruelties of popery and
the inquisition, if these more than popish cruelties and
inquisitorial practices are let loose among us ; to turn
forth into our settlements, among our ancient connex-
ions, friends, and relations, the merciless cannibal,
thirsting for the blood of man, woman and child! to i
send forth the inﬁdel savage——against whom? against
your protestant brethren; to lay waste their country;
to desolate their dwellings, and extirpate their race and
name, with these horrible hell-hounds of savage war‘.

Spain armed herself with blood-hounds, to extirpate
the wretched natives of America; and we improve on
the inhuman example even of Spanish cruelty. We
turn loose these savage hell-hounds against our brethren
and countrymen in America, of the same language,
laws, liberties, and religion; endeared to us by every
tie that should sanctify humanity.

My lords, this awful subject, so important to our
honor, our constitution, and our religion, demands the
most solemn and effectual inquiry. And I again call

State; to examine it thoroughly, and decisively, and to
stamp upon it an indelible stigma of the public abhor-

religion, to do away these iniquities from among us.
Let them perform a lustration; let them purify this
House, and this country from this sin.

My lords, I am old and weak, and at present una-
ble to say more ; but my feelings and indignation were
too strong to have said less. I could not have slept this
night in my bed, nor reposed my head on my pillow,
without giving this vent to my eternal abhorrence of
such preposterous and enormous principles.

I as cheap as any man in America; and I believe I may

to read in the Psalter in a fortnight: and I always feel

‘I have long since exploded. I have a. rare knack of

to a celebrated Doctor at Philadelphia, whose works I

criterion of school government. It is, landlord, it is
the very philosopher’s stone. I am told, likewise,
thatthis same great Doctor does not believe that Solo-

demand tendollars a month and his board. And he
might truly be said to rule with a rod of iron; for he
kept an ironwood cudgel in his school, four feet long ;
and it was’ enough to chill one’s blood to hear the
shrieks of the little innocents, which were caused by
his barbarity. 1’ have heard my wife say, tthat Sue
Gossip told her, that she has seen the marks of his lashes
on the back of her neighbour Rymple’s son Darling,
for twelve hours after the drubbing. At least, the
boy told her with his own mouth, that they might be
seen, ifathey would only take the trouble to strip his
shirt off. And, besides, master Ignoramus, he was the
most niggardly of all the human race. Idon’t suppose
that my bar- room was one dollar the richer for him,
in the course of the whole time which he tarried with
us. VVhile the young people of the town were recreating

themselves, and taking a sociable glass, of an evening, at '

my house, the stupid_blockhead was etarnally in‘ his
charnber, poring over his musty books. v Butﬁnally he

‘you can do yourself honor in taking the charge of a

common English School. ’ '
Schoolm. Gentlemen, I Will give you a short history
of my life. From seven, to ﬁfteen years of age, I
went to school perhaps as much as one year. In which
time,I went through Di1worth‘s Spelling-Book, the
Psalter, the New-Test"amen"t; and could read the

newspaper without spelling more than half the words.~

By this time, feeling a little above‘ the common level,
I enlisted a soldier in the army, where] continued SIX
years; and made such proﬁciency in the military art,

‘that I was frequently talked of for aicorporal. I had

likewise larn’d_ to write considerably, and to Cypher as

fur as Division. ‘The multiplication table I had’at my‘

tongue’s end, and have not forgot it to this day. ’ At
length, receivin a severe ﬂogging for nothing at all, I
am not ashame to own that I deserted. and went into
one of the back settlements, and offered myself as a

‘teacher. I was immediately employed in that service,

and, though I am obliged to say it myself, I do assure
you I soon became very famous." Since that time,
which is eleven years, I have followed thepbusiness
constantly; at least, every winter ; for in the summer‘,
it is not customary in the towns in eneral, to continue
a man’s school. One thing I woul not forget to men-
tion; and that is, I have travelled about the country
so much, and been in the army so long (which is allow-
ed to be the best school inthe world) that I consider
myself as’ being thorou hly acquainted with mankind.
You will not be insensi le, gentlemen,’ of what great
importance this last acquisition is, to one who has the
care of youth. V

ation. , L .
Isl. Com. It is very strange! You must have studied
hard, to learn all these things, and that without a mas-
ter too.

Sc/wolm. Indeed I have, Sir; and if I had time, I
could tell you things stranger still.

Par. Can you tell in what part of the world you
were born; whether in the torrid, frigid, or temper-
ate zone ? .

Sclzoolm. I was not born in the man, Sir, nor in any
other of the West-India Islands -, but 1 was born in
New-England, in the state of New—Jersey, and Com-
monwealth of the United States of America. ‘ -

a cheaper master; and I move for engaging him at once.
Par. Gentlemen, how long will you be blind to your
own interest? I can say with you, that I am perfectly
satisfied——that the man is, in his profession, emphatically
what he calls himself by name, an ignoramus; and to-
tally incapable of instructing our children. You know
not who he is, or what he is; whether he be a thief, a
liar, or a drunkarcl. The very terms, on which he
offers himself, ought to operate as a suﬂicientobjection
against him. I am sensible that my vote will now be of
no avail, since you are all agreed. I have been for
years striving to procure a man of abilities and morals,
suitable for the employment; and such a one I had ob-
tained; but, alas! we were unworthy of him. We
aspersed his character; invented a multitude of false-
lioods; magniﬁed every trifling error in his conduct;
and even converted his virtues into vices. We refused
to give him that pecuniary reward which his services
demanded; and he, knowing his own worth, and our
unworthiness, has left us forever.

WILKES, 1770.

Mr Loans, .
, HERE is one plain maxim, to which I have in-
variably adhered through life; that in every
question in which my liberty or my property were

’ concerned, I should cons‘ult and be determined by the

dictates of common sense. I confess, my lords, that I
am apt to distrust the reﬁnements of learning, because
I have -seen the ablest and most ‘learned men equally
liable to deceive themselves, and to mislead others.
The condition of human nature would be lamenta-

ble indeed, if nothing less than the greatest learning ’

and talents, which fall to the, share of so small a,num-
ber of men, were sufficient: to direct our Judgment and

our conduct. But Providence has taken better care of
our happiness, and given us, in the simplicity of com-
mon sense, a rule for our direction,_by which we shall
never be misled. ' s

« Iconfess, my lords, I had no other rruide in drawing
’up the amendment, which I submitted to your consid-
eration. And before I heard the opinion of the noble
lord who spoke last, I did not conceive, thatlit was
even within the limits of possibility for the greatest hu-
man genius, the most subtle understanding, or the
acute-st wit, so strangely to misrepresent my meaning;
and to give it an interpretation so entirely foreign from
whatl intended to express, and from that sense, which
the very terms of the amendment plainly and distinctly
carry with them. »

If there be the smallest foundation for the censure
thrown upon me by that noble lord; if, either express-
ly or by the most dist-antimplication,I have said or in-
sinuated any part of what the noble lord has charged
me with, discard my opinions forever ; discard the
motion with contempt. ' ’

My lords, I must beg the indulgence of the House.
Neither Will my health permit me, nor do I pretend
to be qualified, to follow that learned lord minutely
through’ the whole of his argument. No man is better
acquainted with his abilities and learning, ‘nor has a
greater respect for them, than I have. , 1 have had the
pleasure of "sittin with him in the other House, and
always listened to im with attention. I have not now
lost a word of what he said,nordid I ever. Upon the
present question, I meet him without‘ fear.

The evidence, which truth carries'with it, is supe-
rior to all arguments; it neither wants the support,
nor dreads the opposition of the greatest abilities. If
thefeiitbe a single word in the amendment to justify the
Interpretation, which the noble lord has been pleased
to give it, I am ready to renounce the whole. Let it

moderate and even ; when the former is dejected with
sorrow, the latter is languid; and when that is inilazned
by passion, this is elevated.

and to endeavour that the tone ofhis voice appearnatural
and unaﬁected. And for this end, he must take care to
suit it to the nature of theisubject; but still so as to be
always grave and decent. Some persons continue a
discourse in such a low and drawling manner, that they
can scarcely be heard by their audience. Others again
hurry on in so loud and boisterous a manner, as if they
imagined their hearers were deaf. But all the music
and harmony of voice lies between these extremes.

Perhaps nothing is of more importance to a speaker,
than a proper attention to accent. emphasis, and ca-
dence. Every word in our language, of more than one
syllable, has, at least, one accented syllable. This sylla-
ble ought to be rightly known, and the word should be
pronounced by the speaker in the same manner as he
would pronounce it in ordinary conversation. By em-
phasis, we distinguish those words in a sentence which
we esteem the most important, by laying a greater
stress of voice upon them than we do upon the others.
And it is surprising to observe how the sense of a
phrase may be altered by varying the emphasis. The
following example will serve as an illustration.

This short question, “Will you ride to town to-
day ?” may be understood in four different ways, and,
consequently, may receive four different answers, ac-
cording to the placing of the emphasis.

If it be pronounced thus; Will you ride to town
to-day‘? the answer may properly be, No; I‘ shall send
my son. If thus; Will you ride to town to-day?
Answer, No; I intend to walk. Will you ride to

their jurisdiction, or suppose an authority in this House

‘ to arraign the justice of their sentence?

I am sure that every lord who hears me, will bear
me" witness that I said not one word touching the mer-
its of the Middlesex election. Far frorimconveying
any opinion upon that matter in the a1nendment,.l
did not, even in discourse, deliver my own sentiments

upon it.» I did not say that the House of Commons ‘

had done either right or wrong; but when his Majesty
was pleased to recommend it to us to cultivate unanim-
-ity amongst ourselves, I thought it the duty of this
‘House, as the great hereditarycouncil of the crown,
to state to his Majesty the distracted condition of his
dominions, together with the. events which had destroy-
ed unaniinity among hissubjects. . yr
But, my lords, I stated those events merely‘ as facts,
without the smallest addition either of censure or of
opinion. They are facts, my lords, which I am not
only convinced are true, but which Iknow are indis-
putably true. 
,. Do, they not tell us, in so many words, that Mr.
Wilkes, having been expelled, was thereby rendered
incapable of serving in that Parliament? and is it not

their resolution alone, which refuses to the subjectehist

the electors of Middlesex are deprived of their free

terms, provided the substances be preserved; and these
are facts, my lords, which I am sure will always retain

' their Weight and importance, in whatever form of lan-

guage they are described.

The constitution of this country has been openly in.
vaded in fact ; and I have heard, with horror and aston-
ishment, that very invasion defended upon principle.
What is this mysterious power, undeﬁned by law,un-
known to the subject; which we must not approach
without awe, nor speak of without reverence; which
no man ma question, and to which all men must sub~
mit? My l’ords,,l thought the slavish doctrine of pas.
sive obedience had long since i’ been exploded: and,
when our kings were obli ed to confess that their title
to the crown, and the rule of their government, had
no other foundation than the known laws of the land,
I never expected to hear a divine right, or a divine in-
fallibility, attributed to any other branch of the legis-'
lature. .

My lords, I beg to be understood.. N 0 man respects
the House of Commons more than Ido, or would con-

them their just and legal authority. ithin the

SPEECH or Me. Fox, IN THE Barrxsn PARLIAMENT,
oz; Axmucau Arruns, 1778.

OU have now two wars before you, of which you
must choose one, for both you cannot support.
The war against America has hitherto been carried on
a ainst her alone, unassisted by any ally whatever.
otwithstanding she stood alone, you have been obliged
uniformly to increase your exertions, and to push your
efforts to the extent of your power, without being able
to bring it to an issue. You have exerted alLyour force
hitherto without effect, and you cannot now divide a
force. found already inadequate to its object.

A THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. * 173

My opinion is for withdrawing your forces " from
America entirely; for a defensive war you can never
think of there. A defensive ‘war would ruin this nation
at any time ; and in any circumstances, offensive War
is pointed out as proper for this country; our situation

points it out; and the spirit of the nation impels us to .

attack rather than (lefend.~ Attack France, then, for
she is your object. The nature of the wars is quite dif-A
ferent: the war against. America is against your own
countrymen; you have stopped me from saying against
your feliow subjects; that a ainst France is against
your inveterate enemy and riva . Every blow you strike
in America is against yourselves; it is against all .«idea.
of reconciliation, and against your own interest, though
you should be able, as you never will be, to force them
to submit. Every stroke against France is of advantage
to you: America must .be.cenquered in France; France
never can be conquered in America. .
The war of the Americans is a war of passion ; it is of
such a nature as to be supported by the most powerful
virtues, love of liberty and of their country ; and, at the
same time, by those passions in the human heart which

. give courage, strength, and perseverance to man ; the

spirit of revenge for the injuries you have done them;
of retaliation for the hardships you have inﬂicted on

‘ them; and of opposition to the unjust powersyou have

exercised over them. Every thing combines to animate‘

them to this war, and such a war is without end ;.‘ for
. whatever obstinacy, enthusiasm ever inspired man with,

you will now ﬁnd in America. .No matter what gives
birth to that enthusiasm ; whether the name of religion
or of liberty, the eﬁects are the same _; it inspires a spirit
which is unconquerable, and solicitous to undergo dif-
ficulty, danger, and hardship: and as long as there is

a man in America, a bein formed such as we are, on
. g

will have him presentihimself against you in the ﬁeld.
Thepwar of France is a war of another sort; the War
of France is a war of interest: it was her interest which

est that she will measure its continuance. Turn your
face at once against her ; attack her wherever she is
exposed; crush her commerce wherever you can ; make

her feel heavy and immediate distress throughout the 7

nation: the people will soon cry out to their govern-
ment. Whilst the advantages she promises herself are
remote and uncertain, inflict present evils and distresses
upon her subjects : the people will become discontented
and clamorous; she will ﬁnd it a bad bargain, having
entered into this business; and you will force her to

desert any ally that brings so much trouble and distress

upon her. * .,

. What is become of the ancient spirit of this nation?
Where is the national spirit that ever did honor to this
countr ? Have the present ministry spent that too,
with ailmost the last shilling of your money? Arethey
not ashamed of the temporizing conduct they have used
towards France? Her correspondence with America
has been clandestine. Compare that with their conduct
towards Holland, some time ago; but it is the charac-
teristic of little minds to be exact in little things, whilst
the shrink from their rights in eat ones.

back but a year ago to a letter from one of your Sec-

call the measures of France clandestine. his is the
way that ministers support the character of the nation,

that same Holland is spoken of to-day. Even in your

From this you may judge of your situation; from
this you may know what a state you are reduced to.
How will the French party in Holland exult over you.

THE CONJURER, A DIALOGUE.

RICHARD and JACK.

Jack. ‘ ‘ 7HAT a strange man this is, Richard! gDid \

you ever see a conjurer before?

Richard. " There was one travelled this way before
your rernembrance ; but he missed his ﬁgure very much.
I was to have been an officer before this time, accord-
ing to his predictions; and you, Jack", were to have
had a ﬁne rich young lady for your sister-in-law. But
he was only an apprentice in the art; no more than
A, B,- C, to this man. -

Jack. Aye, he is master of his trade, I warrant
you. I dare say, when father comes home, he can tell
him which way the thief is gone with our old Trot.
Uncle Bluster is coming over here this evening to ﬁnd
out who has ot his watch. The Conjurer is just:
gone out to loo at the stars. I suppose, after he has
viewed them a while, he will cast a ﬁgure in his great
black-art book in the other room, and tell in a nice
what things are stolen, and where they are, to a hair’s

"breadth.

Rich. He must have a hawk’s eye to see the stars
this evening. Why don’t you know, Jack, it is cloudy
out a’doors ? .

Jack. That’s nothin with him. He could look
through the clouds with is glass, if it was as dark as
E ypt, as easy as you can look into the other room ;_ or,
ifﬁxe had a mind, he could brush‘ away the clouds in a
trice, with that long wand he carries in his hand. it

thousand years to come. I wish I knew the tenth paij
as much about the planets‘ as he does. ~

Jack. So do I. Don’t you think our neighbours
could hire’him to keep our school, instead of Master
Thinkwell? I believe he has ﬁfty times as much learn-
ing. Aunt Betty tdld, me this afternoon, that he knew
every star in the ‘sky as well as I do the cattle in our
stable; and that he was as well acquainted with every
crook and turn in the milky-way, as I am with the
road to mill. They say he rode round to all the plan-

, ets one night, in a chaise made of moon-light, drawn

by ﬂying horses.‘ V

Conjurer. A [Without, in'a grum hollow 'voz'ce.] Hoc

Rich. Hark! he is going by the window: don’t
you hear him talking to himself? '

Jack. What a strange language‘ he uses ! He is
talking to the man in the moon, Idare say. He will
go into the back room and cast a ﬁgure now: I_will look
t trough the key-hole and see him. [Exit Jack.

Rmich. [Solus.] What a prodigious learned man this
Conjurer must be ! - I should suppose he had read all the

dred years’, to know as much as he does.

up lodgingsat your house to-night. You are greatly
honored to be sure. ; g

A Rich. He is a very extraordinary man, I’ll assure you.

Think. So far I agree with you, Richard. I believe
he is an extraordinary man, and an extraordinary im-
postor too. a "‘ , ‘

Rich. You are always on the side of contraries, Mas-
te_r Thinkwell; but every body‘ is not of so stubborn
faith as you. W hy,‘ there is as great a stir in town as

This shows how necessary it is that a speaker should
know how to place his emphasis. And the only rule
for this is, that he study to attain :1 Just conception ol
the force and spirit of the sentiments which he delivers.
There is as great a difference between one who lays
his emphasis properly, and one who pays no regard to
it, or places it wrong, as there is between one who
plays on an instrument with a masterly hand, and the

' most bungling performer.

» Cadence is the reverse of emphasis. It is a depres-
sion or lowering of the voice; and commonly falls up-
on the last syllable in a sentence. It is varied, how-
ever, according to the sense. When a question is
asked, it seldom falls upon the last word; and many
sentences require no cadence at all.

Every person who speaks in public, should endeavour,
if he can,lto ﬁll the place where he speaks. But still
he ought to be careful not to exceed the natural key
of his voice. If he does, it will neither be soft noi
agreeable ; but either harsh and rough, or too shrill and
squeakintr. Besides, he will not be able to give every
syllable its full and distinct sound ; ‘which will render
what he says obscure, and difficult to be understood.
He should therefore take care to keep his voice within
reach, so as to have it under management, that he may
raise or sink it, or give it any inﬂection he thinks prop-
er; which it will not be in his power to do, if he put
a force upon it, and strain it, beyond its natural tone.

The like caution is to be used against the contrary
extreme, that the voice be not suffered to sink too low.
This will give the speaker pain in -raising it again toits
proper pitch, and be no less offensive to the hearers.
The medium between these two is a moderate and even
voice. But this is not the same in all; that which
is moderate in one would be high in another. Every

erson therefore must regulate it by the natural key of
is own voice. A’ calm and sedate voice is generally

. Think. It is much. easier to account for these things
than to justify them. We shall always act beneath..our--
selves, while we loolgup to worthless wretches as out

vman. This conjurer, in my .opinion, is much less: I

consider him beneath contempt. I am as great a
friend to mirth as yourself; but it is really mortifying.
that my friends should be so anxious to ‘make them-
selves the objects of ridicule. . . ‘ ,

Rich. This is your old strain, Master Thinkwell.
I know you are apt to get round me in your ar uments;

of us. I might go toyou to learn grammar, arithmetic,
and_ the common branches that are taught at school;

vise you to lay out your money for more valuable com-
modities than such gross imposition. Believe me, _R_ich—

Rich. All our neighbours think very differently. He
has told Mrs. Primble where she may ﬁnd her silver
spoon; and Sam Hodkins, the very day he is to be
married ; and the very first moment be cast his eyes on
Bill Blunder’s face, he saw the scar on his _foot, and
told him he had been wounded with an, axe.

sition. What careless lad is there, who us'es~an axe,
that has not a scar on his feet? ~ .

EXTRACT mom Mn. Pi'r'r’s Srrzscu IN THE Bnmsn
‘ ‘PARLIAMENT, JAN. 20, 1775.

WIIEN your lordships look at the papers trans-

, mitted to us from America; when you con-
sider their decency, ﬁrmness, and wisdom, you cannot
but respect their cause, and wish to make it your own.
For myself, I must declare and avow, that in all my
reading and observation, (and it has been my favourite
study: I have read Thucidydes, and have studied and
admired the master-states of the world :) Isay I must
declare, that, for solidity of reasoning, force of sagacity,
and Wisdom of conclusion, under such a complication
of difficult circumstances, no nation, or body of men
can stand in preference to the General Congress at
Philadelphia. I trust it is obvious to your Iordships,
that all attempts to impose servitude upon such men, to
establish despotism over such ‘a mighty continental na-
tion, must be vain, must be fatal.

We shall be forced, ultimately, to retract; let us
retract while we can, not when we must. I say we
must necessarily undo these violent oppressive acts.
They MUST be repealed. You WILL repeal them.
I pledge myself for it, that you will in the end repeal
them. I stake my reputation on it. I will consent to
be taken for an ideot, if they are not ﬁnally repealed.

Avoid, then, this humiliating, disgraceful necessity.
With a dignity becoming your exalted situation‘, make

THE COLUMBIAN omrroa. 195

the first advances to concord, to peace and -happiness:
for it is your true dignity, to act with prudence and

_ justice. That you should first concede, is obvious from
M sound and rational policy; Concession comes with bet-

ter grace,‘and more s_alutary eﬂ"ec.ts from superior ow.
er; it reconciles superiority of power with the feelings
of men; and establishes solid conﬁdence on the founda-
tions of"aﬂ'ection and gratitude.

Every motive, therefore, of justice and of policy-, of
dignity and of prudence, urges you to allay the fer-
ment in America, by a removal of your troops from
Boston; by a repeal of your acts of Parliament; and
by demonstration ofamicable dispositions towards your
colonies. On the other hand, every danger and every
hazard impend, to deter you from perseverance in your
present ruinous measures. Foreign war hanging over
your heads by a’ slight and brittle thread : France and
Spain watching your conduct, and Waiting for the ma-
turitylof your errors ; with a vigilant eye to America,
and the temper of your colonies, more than to their
own concerns, be they what they may.

.To conclude, my lords ; if the ministers thus perse-

ivere in misadvisi-rig and misleading the king, I will not

say, that they can alienate the affections of his subjects
from his crown“; ‘but I will aﬂirm, that they will make
the crown not worth his wearing : I will not say that
the king is betrayed; but I will pronounce, that the
kingdom is undone.

SPEECH or GALGACHUS TO THE CALEDONIAN ARMY.

CouN'mYMEi~:, AND FELLOW-SOLDIERS,

HEN Iconsider the cause, for which we have
drawn our swords, and the necessity of striking

‘an effectual blow, before wesheathe them again, I feel

joyful hopes arising inmy mind‘, that this dayan open-
ing will be made for the restoration of British liberty:
' ‘ 16 *

and for shaking oil’ the infamous yoke of Roman slavery.
Caledonia is yet free. The all-grasping power of Rome
has not yet been able to seize our liberty. But it is to
be preserved only by valour. i

You are not to expect to escape the ravage of the
general plunderers of mankind, by any sentiment of
justice in them. When the countries which are-_more

accessible have been subdued, they will then force their ..

way into those which are harder to be’ overcome.
And if they should conquer the dry land, over the
whole world, they will then think of carrying their
arms beyond the ocean, to see whether there be not
certain unknown regions, which they may attack, and
reduce under subjection to the Roman empire.

For we see that if a country is thought to be power-
ful in arms, the Romans attack it because the conquest

~ will be glorious; if inconsiderable in the military art,

because the victory will be easy; if rich, they are
drawn thither by the hope of plunder ; if poor, by the
desire of fame.

The east, and the west, the south, and the north, the

face of the whole earth isthe scene of their military
achievements. ‘ The world is too little for their ambi- -

tion, and their avarice.‘ Their supreme joy seems to’
be ravaging, ﬁghting, and shedding of blood ; and when
they have unpeopled a region, so that there are none
left alive to bear arms, they say they have given peace
to that country. , i
Our distance from the seat of government, and our
natural defence by the surrounding ocean, render us
olmoximxs to their suspicions: for they know that
Britons are born with an instinctive love of liberty:
and they conclude that we must naturally be led to
think of taking the advantage of our detached situation,
to disengage ourselves, one time or another, from their
oppression.

Thus, my countrymen and fellow-soldiers, suspected
and hated as we ever mustbe by the Romans, there is
no, prospect of our enjoying even a tolerable state of

15 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

best; as a moderate sound is most pleasing to the ear,

if it be clear and distinct. But this equality of the ~

voice must also be accompanied with avariety: other-
wise there can be no harmony; since all harmony con-
sists in variety.

Nothing is less pleasing than a discourse pronounced
throughout in one continued tone of the voice, with-
out any alteration. The equality, -therefore, we are
here speaking of, admits a variety of inflections and
changes within the same pitch. And when that is
altered, the grade tions,whether higher or lower, should
be so gentle and regular as to preserve a due pro-
portion of the parts, and harmony of the whole; which
cannot be done, when the voice is suddenly varied with
too great a distinction. And therefore it should move
from one key to another, so as rather to glide like a

gentle stream, than pour down like a rapid torrent, as

an ingenious writer has well expressed it.
But an affected variety, ill placed, is as disagreeable
to a judicious audience, as the Want of it, Where the

. subject requires it. We may ﬁnd some persons, in pro-

nouncing a grave and ‘plain discourse, affect as many
diﬁerent tones, and variations of their voice, as if they
were acting a comedy; which is doubtless a very great
impropriety. But the orator’s province is not barely
to apply to the .mind, but likewise to the passions;
which require a great variety of the voice, high or
low, vehement or languid, according to the nature of
the passions he designs to affect. So that for any orator
always to use the same tone or degree of his voice, and
expect to answer all his views by it, would be much the
same thing as ifa physician should propose to cure all
distempers by one medicine. And, as a perfect monoto-

i ny is always unpleasant, so it can never be necessary

in any discourse. V
That some sentences ought to be pronounced faster
than others is very manifest. Gay and sprightly ideas

‘i should not only be expressed louder, but also quicker

than such as are melancholy. And when We press an

bondage under them. - Let us, then, in the ‘name of
all that is sacred, and in defence of all that is dear- to
us, resolve to exert ourselves, if not for glory, at least
for safety ;‘if not in vindication of British honor, at
least in defence of our lives, , t .

But, after all, who are these mighty Romans ? Are
they gods; or mortal men, like ourselves? Do we
not see that they fall into the: same errors and weak-
nesses,‘ as others? Does not peace effeminate them?
Does not abundance debauch them? Does not \wan-'

- tonness enervate them? Do they not even go to ex
cess in the most unmanly vices? And can you imagine a

that they who are remarkable for their vices are like-
wise remarkable for their valo_ur? What then do we
dread? Shalllrtell you the truth, mylf€llQW-S0l(lleI‘S?
It is'»by means of our intestine divisions, ‘that the Re-

_* mans have gained siich great advantage over us; \ They
turn the misconduct of their enemies to their own

praise. They boast of what they have done, and say

, nothing of what we might have done, had we been so

wise, as to unite against them.

tries; some more,sonie less capable of bearing fatigue

you will see them more disunited than we are now.

shame I must add, Britons, who basely lend their limbs
and lives, to build up a foreign tyranny ; can one im-

‘ agine that these will be longer enemies than. slaves?
' or that such an army is held together by sentiments of

ﬁdelity or affection? No: . the only bond of union
among them is fear. ‘ And whenever terror ceases to
work upon the minds of that mixed multitude, they

On our side there is every possible incitement to valour.
The Roman courage is not, as ours, inﬂamed by the
thoughts of wives and children in danger of falling in-

to the hands of the enemy. The Romans have not
parents, as we have, to reproach them if they should
desert their inﬁrm old age. They have no Country
here to ﬁght for. They are a motley collection of
foreigners, in a land wholly unknown to them; cut
off from their native country, hemmed in by the sur-
rounding ocean; and given, I hope, a prey into our
hands, without any possibility of escape. Let not the
sound of the Roman name atfright your ears, nor let
the glare of gold or silver, upon their armour, dazzle
your eyes. It is not by old or silver, that men are
either wounded or defenc ed; though they are ren-
dered a richer prey to the conquerors. Let,us boldly
attack this disunited rabble. We shall find among them-
selves a reinforcement to our army.

And what will there be then to fear? A few half
garrisoned forts; a few municipal towns, inhabited by
worn-out old men; discord universally prevailing, oc-
casioned by tyranny in those who command, and ob-
stinacy in those who should obey. * On our side, an
army united in the cause of their country, their wives,
their children, their aged parents, their lives. At the
head of this army, I hope I do not offend against modesty
in saying, there is a General ready to exertall his abil-
ities, such as they are, and to hazard his life in leading
you to victory, and to freedom.

I conclude, my countrymen and fellow-soldiers,
with uttin you in mind, that on your behaviour this
day epenrs your future enjoyment of peace and lib-
erty, or your subjection to a tyrannical enemy, with
all its grievous conse uences. When, therefore, you
come to engage, thinlt of yourancestors, and think of

MODERN EDUCA-TXON.
DIALOGUE Brrrwsiax A PHECEPTOR or AN ACADEMY,
AND PARENT or AN orrsaen PUPIL.

Preceptor.I AM heartily sick of this modern mode”

[Solus.] of education. Nothing but trash will
suit the taste of people at this day. I am. perplexed be-
yond all endurance with these frequent solicitationsiof
parents, to give their children graceful "airs, polite ac-
complishments, and a smattering of what they call the
ﬁne arts ; while nothing is said about teaching them the

‘substantial branches ofliterature. If they caxil)t1t dance

a little, ﬁddle a. little, ﬂute a little, and‘mal<e a hand-
some bow and courtesy, that is sufﬁcientto make them
famous, in this enlightened age. ’ Three-fourths of the
teachers of those arts, which once were esteemed most
valuable, will soon be out of employment, at this rate.
For my part, I am convinced, that, if Lhad been a
dancing master, music master, stage player, or mounte-
bank, I should have been much more respected, and
much better supported, than I am at present.
Inter PARENT.

Parent.‘ ' Your humble servant, Sir, are you the
principal of this Academy?

Prccep. lam, at your service, Sir.

Par. I have heard much of the fame of your insti-
tution, and am desirous of putting a son, of about
twelve years of age, under your tuition. I su post;
you have masters who teach the various branc es of
the polite arts. y , ’

Precep. We are not inattentive to those arts, Sir;
but the fame of our Academy does not rest upon them.
Useful learning is our grand object. What studies do
you wish to put your son upon '!

Par. I wish him to be perfected in music, dancing,

-. drawing, &c. and as he possesses a promising genius for;

poetry, I would by all means have that cultivated.

190 THE, COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

Precep. These are not all the branches, I trust, in
which he is to be instructed. You mention nothing of
reading, writing, arithmetic, language, &c. Are these
to be wholly neglected ?

Par. Why, as to these every-day branches, I can-
not sayl feel very anxious about them. The boy reads
well now; Writes a decent hand; is acquainted with
the ground rules of arithmetic, and pronounces the

. English language genteelly. He has been a long time

under the care of Mr. Honestus, our town schoolmas-
ter, who has taught him all these things sufﬁcientl .
So that I think any more time devoted to them wou d
be wasted. «

Precep. If he is such an adept that there is no room
for his progressing in those arts; yet I think, at least,
there is need of practice, lest, at his age, he should
forget what he has learned.

Par. That I shall leave to your discretion. But
there is one branch, of great importance, which I have
not yet mentioned, and to whichl would have particu-
lar attention paid; I meant the art of speaking. You
will ﬁnd him not deﬁcient in that respect; though per-
haps it requires as much practice to make one perfect in
that, as in any art whatever. He has already learned
by heart a great numberof pieces, and has acted a part
in several comedies and tragedies with much applause.
lt hasbeen the custom of our master to have an exhi-
bition at least once a quarter; and my son has always
been considered as one of his best performers. He
lately took the part of J emmy Jumps, in the farce called
The Farmer, and acted it to universal acceptation.

Prccep. Imust confess, Sir, that your account of
your soil does not appear to me to be very ﬂatterin .

Par. Why so, pray? have you not an ear for e 0-
quence ? ‘

Prece . Indeed I have, Sir. No man is more
charme than I am with its enrapturing sounds. No
music rests sweeter on my car than th ‘melodious notes,
proceeding from the mouth of a judicious, well-inst.ruct-

ed, and powerful orator. But I must tell you plainly,
that I am by no means pleased to see parents take so

-much pains to transform their children into monkeys"

instead of men. What signs of oratory do you imagine
you can discern in a boy, rigged out in a fantastical
dress, skipping about the stage like a baboon, in the
character of Jemmy Jumps, Betty Jumps, or any other
jumper ? g A ,

Par. L Do you not approve of exhibitions then?

Precep. Not much, I confess, in the way thcyare
generally conducted. A master, who has four in a
year, must necessarily rob his pupils of one quarter of
that time, which, in my opinion, might be much better
employed in attending to what would be useful for
them in life. .

Par.» What can be more useful for a child, under
such a government as ours, than to be able to speak
before anaudience with a graceful ease, and a manful
dignity? My son, for aughtl know, may be a member
of Congress before he dies. ’ V

Precep. For that very reason I would educate him
differently. Iwould lay the foundation of his future
fame on the firm basis of the solid sciences ; that he
might be able in time to do something more than a mere
parrot, or an ape, who are capable only of speaking
theiwords, and mimicking the actions of others. He
should ﬁrst be taught to read. He should likewise be
taught to compose for himself; and I would not be
wanting in my endeavours to make him a speaker.

Par. Surely, Mr. Preceptor, you must be very
wroncr in your notions. 1 have ever pursued a diﬂ"er-
ent plan with my children‘; and there are none in the
country, though] say it myself, who are more univer-
sally caressed. lhave a daughter that has seen but
fourteen years, who is capable of gracing the politcst
circles. It is allowed that she can enter, and eave a
room, with as much ease and dignity as any lady of
quality whatever. And this is evidently owing alto-—
gather to her polite education. I boarded her a year

IQQ THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

in the capital, where she enjoyed every possible advan.
tage. She attended the most accomplished masters in
the ornamental branches of science; visited the gen-
teelest families, and frequented all the scenes ofamuse-
ment. It is true, her letters are not always written
quite so accurately as could be wished ; yet she dances
well, plays well on the piano-forte, and sings like a
nightingale.

Precep. Does she know the art of making a good

udding .7 Can she darn a stocking well? or is she ca-
pable of patching the elbows of her husband’s coat,
should she ever be so lucky as to get one ? If she is to
remain ignorant of all such domestic employments, as
much as I value herother accomplishments, and as
much as Imight be in want of a wife, I would not
marry her with twice her weight in gold.

Par. Her accomplishments will command her a hus-
band as soon as she wishes. But so long as a single
cent of my property remains, her delicate hands shall
never be so unworthily employed. ‘ r

Precep. But suppose a reverse of fortune should
overtake you, what is to become of the child‘; as you
sa she’understands nothing of domestic aﬁ"airs.,? vWill
it e more honorable, do you imagine, for her to be
maintained by the charity of the people, than by her
own industry ?

— Par. There are many ways for her to be supported. i

I would not have you think she is wholly ignorant of
the use of the needle, though she never employed it in
so disgraceful a manner as that of darning stockings!
or botching tattered garments! But we will wave that
subject, and attend to the other. Will you receive the
boy) for the purposes before mentioned?

recep. :Why, indeed, Sir, I cannot. Though I
am far from condemning altogether your favourite
branches, yet I consider them all as subordinate, and
some of them, at least, totally useless. ~ We devote but
a small portion of our time to the attainment of such
superﬁcial accomplishments. I would therefore recom-

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 193

mend it to you, to commit him to the care of those
persons, who have been so successful in the instruction
of his sister.

Par. I confess lam so far convinced of the propri-
ety of your method, that, if you will admit him into
your Academy, I will renounce all right of dictating to
you his lessons of instruction, except in one single in-
stance; and in that I am persuaded we shall not disav
gt-ee; I mean the art of speaking. ‘

Precrp. I shall agree to thitt only under certain
limitations. rfhat is an art which undoubtedly demands
our solicitous attention ; but it ought never to be pur-
sued to the injury ofother studies. I am sensible that
it is no less useful to a pupil than entertaining to an
audience, to exercise him occasionally on the stage in
declaiming judicious and well-written compositions, and
pronouncing such selected dialogues, as will tend to
give gracefulness to his attitude, and familiarity to his
tones and gestures. But, admitting that time could be
spared from more «important pursuits, I see but little
good resulting from the exhibition of whole comedies
and tragedies in our academics and schools; while
much evil is to be feared, both from the immorality of
the plays, and the dissipation it introduces into society.
Besides, all boys are not calculated for orators ; and
though Demosthenes surmounted almost insuperable
diliiculties in the acquirement of his art, it is folly to
suppose that his example is capable of universal imitao
tion. Icannot believe it a very pleasing entertainment
to a discerning audience, to see a boy without talents,
mounted u on the rostrum, spouting forth sentences
which he oes not understand, and which, perhaps,
are chosen with as little judgment as they are deliv-
ered with propriety. But what can be more disgusting
than to see innocent, and timid females, whose excel-
lence, in part, consists in their modesty, and silence be-
fore superiours, encouraged to reverse the order of na-
ture, by playing the orator on a public stage! And
what often enhances our disgust, and sickens all our

17

194 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

feelings, is, that their lips are taught to pronounce
sentiments, extracted from the Very dregs of the Euro-

pean drama.

Par. Then it seems you do not approve of females

speaking at all?
A Precep. Not on a public sta e, unless I wished to
see them di_vested of half their dixarms.‘ Such mascu-
line employments as ill become them, as the labours of
the ﬁeld, or the habits prof the stronger sex. I would
have them taught to read and pronounce well at school;
but nature ne‘ver designed them for‘ public orators;
much less, that they should be degraded to the vile.
purpose of entertaining the votaries of theatrical amuse-
ments. _

Par. Why, you differ widely from many, whose
pride is to be considered as the standards of modern
taste. It does not now offend against the rules of del-
icacy, for the cliﬂerent sexes to make exchange of gar-
ments now and then, provided the grand object of
amusement be promoted by it. I was in Boston last
week, and there I saw a beautiful young lady, rigged
out from top to toe in men’s apparel, astride a gay
horse, parading through the streets, for the entertain-
ment of the ladies and gentlemen of that polite metrop-
olis. And none appeared to be offended, except a few
who had not attained a relish for reﬁned pleasures.

Precep. Yes, and I am told, that, attheir theatres,
itis no uncommon thing forawoman to make her appear-

ance, in that apparel, with a sword by her side, strut- ,

ting across the stage, and swearing oaths big enough
to choke an Algerine pirate; and yet it is so agreeable
to the modern ton, that even ladies of distinguished re-
ﬁnement are ashamed to blush at her! ’

Par. You have made me so far a convert to your
sentiments on this subject, and given me such proofs of
your superiour judgment in the education of youth, that
I am determined to commit my son, without any reserve,
to your care and instruction. Till you hear from me
again, I am, Sir,wyour obedient servant.

THE EXISTENCE or Goo,/oeuoxsrmvren rnou THE
VVonKs or CREATION; BEING A SERMON PREACHED
AT PROVIDENCE, BY JONATHAN MAXCY, A. M.
PRESIDENT or RHODE-ISLAND COLLEGE, 1795
raom ROMANS i. 20.

[N. B. When found expedient, the fol lowing Sermon may
cowzvenientlg be divided into three or four parts, suitable for
declamations. The author of this work did not intend at
first to insert the whole; but, in attempting to make a selec-
tion, he couldﬁnd nopart which he was willing to leaVe.]

NOTHING will more effectually guard us against
vice, than a ﬁrm belief in the existence of God.
For surely if we realize that there is such a Being, we
shall naturally infer from his perfections, from the na-
ture of his moral government, and from our situation
as rational creatures, that we are amenable at his awful
tribunal. Superior power, wisdom, and goodness,
always lay us under restraint, and command our vene-
ration. These, even in a mortal, overawe us. They
restrain not only the actions, but the words and thoughts
of the most vicious and abandoned. Our happiness de—
pends on our virtue. Our virtue depends on the com
lormity of our hearts and conduct to the laws prescri-
bed us by our beneﬁcent Creator.

Of what vast importance then is it to our present as
well as future felicity, to possess in our hearts a feeling
sense, and in our understanding a clear conviction, of
the existence of that Being whose power and goodness
are unbounded, whose presence ﬁlls immensity, and
whose wisdom, like a torrent of lightning, emanates
through all the dark recesses of eternal duration ! How
great must be the effect of a sense of the presence of
the great Creator and Governor of all tliings, to whom
belong the attributes, eternity, independency, perfect
holiness, inﬁexiblejustice, and inviolable veracity;com-
plete happiness and glorious majesty ; supreme right
and unbounded dominion !

196 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

A sense of accountability to God will retard the
eager pursuit of vice; it will humble the heart of the
proud, it will bridle the tongue pf the profane, and
snatch the knife from the hand of the assassin. A belief
of the existence of God is the true original source of all

w'i1'tue, and the only foundation of all religion, natural

or revealed. Set aside this great luminous truth, erase
the conviction of it from the heart, you then place vir-
tue and vice on the same level; you drive alllicted in-
nocence into despair; you add new elfrontery to the
marred visage of guilt; you plant thorns in the path,
and shed an impenetrable gloom over the prospects of
the righteous- _

Sin has alienated the affections, and diverted the ‘at-
tention of men from the great Jehovah. “ Darkness
has covered the earth, and gross darkness the people.”
Men have worshipped the works ‘of their own hands,
and neglected the true God, though his existence and
perfections were stamped in glaring characters on all
creation. From the regularity, order, beauty, and con-
servation of this great system of things, of which man
makes a part ; from the uniform tendency of all its di-
visions to their proper ends, the existence of God shines
as clearly as the sun in the heavens. “ From the
things that are made,” says the text, “ are seen his
eternal power and Godhead.”

_l. Man himself is a proof of God’s existence. Let
us, place him beforepus in his full -stature. We are at
once impressed with the beautiful organization of his
body, with the orderly and harmonious arrangement of
his members. Such is the disposition ofthese, that their
motion is the most easy, graceful, and useful, that can
be conceived. We are astonished to see the same sim-
ple matter diversified into so many different substances,
of rlitfereiit qualities, size, and ii ure. If we pursue
our researches through the internal economy, we shall
ﬁnd, that all the dillerent opposite parts correspond to
each other with the utmost exactness and order; that
they.all answer the most beneﬁcent purposes.

opponent, the voice should be brisk. But to hurry or
in a precipitate manner without pausing, till stopped fol
want of breath, is certainly a very great fault. This

i destroys not only the necessary distinction between sen-

tence and sentence, but likewise between the several
words of the same sentence; by which mean, all the
grace of speaking is lost, and in a great measure, the
advantage of hearing.

Young persons are very liable to this, especially at

i first setting out. And it often arises from difﬁdence.

They are jealous of their performances, and the suc-
cess they may have in speaking, which gives them a

ain till it is over- and this Juts them into a hurry of
P 2 .

mind, which incapacitates them from governing their‘

voice, and keeping it under that due regulation which
perhaps they proposed to themselves before they began
to speak.

And as a precipitant and hasty pronunciation is cul-
pable, so likewise on the other hand, it is a fault to
speak too slow. This seems to argue a heaviness in

the speaker. And as he appears cool himself, he can i

never expect to warm his hearers, and excite their af-
fections. When not only every word, but every sylla-
ble is drawn out to too great a length, the ideas do
not come fast enough to keep up the attention without
much uneasiness. Now, to avoid either of the two
extremes last mentioned, the voice ought to be sedate
and distinct. And in order to render it distinct, it is
necessary, not only that each word and syllable should

have its just and full sound, both as to time and accent, ‘

but likewise that every sentence, and part of a sentence,
‘should be separated by its proper pause.

This is more easy to be done in reading, from the
assistance of the points; but it is no less to be attended
to in speaking, if we would pronounce in adistinct
and graceful manner. For every one should speak in

the same manner as he ought to read, if he could ar- V

rive at that exactness. Now the common rule given in
pausing is, that we stop our voice at a comma till we

This wonderful machine, the human body, is ani-
mated, cherished, and preserved, by a’ spirit within,
which pervades every particle, feels in every organ,
warns us of injury, and administers to .our pleasures.
Erect in stature, man differs from all other animals.
Though his foot is conﬁned to the earth, yet his eye
measures the whole circuit of heaven,and in an instant
takes in thousands of worlds. His countenance is turn-
ed upward, to teach us that he is not, like other animals,
limited to the earth, but looks forward to brighter
scenes of existence in the skies.

Whence came this erect, orderly, beautiful constitu-
tion of the human body? Did it spring up from the
earth. self-formed? Surely not. Earth itself is in-
active matter. That which has no motion can never

produce any. Man surely could not, as has been

vainly and idly supposed, have been formed by the for-
tuitous concurrence of atoms. We behold the most ex-
act order in the constitution of the human body. Or-
der always involves desi n. Design always involves
intelligence. That inte ligence, which directed the
orderly formation of the human body, must have resi-

/ded in a being whose power was adequate to the pro-

duction of such an effect.

Creation surely is the prerogative of a self-existent,
uncaused Being. Finite creatures may arrange and
dispose, but they cannot create ; they cannot give life.
it is a universal law through all nature, that like pro-
duceslike. The samelaws most probably obtain throu la
the whole system in which we are connected. e
have therefore no reason to suppose that angels created

‘man. Neither can we, without the greatest absurdity,

admit that he was formed by himself, or by mere ac-
cident. If in the latter way, why do we never see
men formed so in the present day? Why do we never
see thé clods of earth brightening into human flesh,
and the dust under our feet crawling into aniniamd
forms, and starting up into life and intelligence '2.

198 THE. COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

If we even admit that either of the forementioned

‘causes might have produced man, yet neither of them

could have preserved him in existence one moment.
There must therefore be a God uncaused, independent,
and complete. The nobler part of man clearly evinccs
this great truth. When we consider the boundless de-
sires and the inconceivable activity of the soul of man,
we can refer his origin to nothing but God. How as-
tonishing are the reasoning faculties ofman! How sur-
prising the power of comparing, arranging, and con-
necting his ideas! How wonderful is the power of im-
agination! On its wings, in a moment, we can trans-
port ourselves to the most distant part of the universe.
We can ﬂy back, and live the lives of all antiquity, or
surmount the limits of time, and sail along the vast
range of eternity. W hence these astonishing powers,
if not from a God of inﬁnite wisdom, goodness, and
power?

2. “ The invisible things of him from the creation
of the world,” says the ‘text, “ are clearly seen.”
Let us for a moment behold our earth. With what a
delightful scene are we here presented! the diversiﬁ-

'cation of its surface into land and water, islands and

lakes, springs and rive‘rs,~ hills and vallies, mountains
and plains, renders i_t to man doubly enchanting. We
are entertained ‘with an agreeable variety, without be-
ing disgusted by a tedious uniformity. Ever thing
appears admirably formed for our proﬁt and delight.
There the vallies are, clothed in smiling green, and the
plains are bending with corn. Here is the gentle hill
to delight the eye, and beyond, slow rising from the
earth, swells the huge mountain, and, with all its load
of waters, rocks, and woods, heaves itself up into the
skies. Why this pleasing, vast deformity of nature?
Undoubtedly for the beneﬁt of. man. From the moun-
tains descend streams to fertilize the plains below, and
cover them with wealth and beauty.

The earth not only produces every thing necessary
to support our bodies, but to remedy our diseases, and

gratify our senses. Who covered the earth with such
a pleasing variety of fruits and ﬂowers V? Who gave
them their delightful fragrance, and painted them with
such exquisite‘ colours ? Who causes the same‘ water to
whiten ‘in the lily, that blushes in the rose? Do not
these things indicate a Cause inﬁnitely superiour to any
ﬁnite being? Do they not directly lead us to believe
the existence of God, to admire his goodness, to revere
his power, to adore his wisdom, in so happily accom.

.II10(iZtli1Ig our external circumstances" to our situation

and internal constitution ?

3. But how are we astonished to behold the vast
ocean, rolling its immense burden of waters! Who
gave itsuch a conﬁguration of particles as to render it
moveable by the least pressure, and atthe same time so
stron as to support the heaviesmveights? Who spread
out tis yast highway of all the nations under
heaven? Who gave it its regular motion? Who
conﬁned it within its bounds? A little more mo-

tion would disorder the whole world! A small in-

citement on the tide would drown whole kingdoms.
Who restrains the proud waves, when the tempest lifts
them to the clouds ? Who measured the great waters,
and subjected them to invariable laws ? That great Be-
ing, “ who placed the sand for the bound thereof, by
a perpetual decree that it cannot pass; and though
the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not
prevail ; though they roar, yet can they not pass over.”
With reason may we believe, that from the things that
are made are clearly seen eternal power and wisdom.

-‘ 4. "Passing by the numerous productionsand appen-

 dages of the earth, let us rise from it, and consider the

body of air with which we‘ are surrounded. What a
convincing proof do we here ﬁnd of the existence of
God! Such is the subtilty and transparency of the
air, that it receives the rays of thesun and stars, con-
veying them with inconceivable velocity to objects on
the earth, rendering them visible, and decorating the

whole surface of the globe with an agreeable inter-
mixture of light, shade, and colours. But still this air
hasa sufficient consistencyand strength to support clouds,
and all the winged inhabitants. Had it been less sub-
tile, it "would have intercepted the light. Had it been
moiie rariﬁed, it would not have supported its" inhab-
itants, nor have afforded sufficient moisture for the pur-
poses of respiration. What then but inﬁnite wisdom
could have tempered the air so nicely, as to give it suf-
ficient strength to support clouds for rain, to afford
wind for health, and at the same time to possess the
poweriof conveying sound and light? How wonderful
is this element! Hgow clearly ‘does it discover inﬁnite
wisdom, power, and goodness!

5. 'But when we cast our eyes up to the ﬁrmament
of heaven, we clearly see that it declares God’s handy
work. Here the immense theatre of God’s works opens
up_on us, and discloses ten thousand magniﬁcent, splen-
didrobjects. We dwindle to nothing in comparison
with this au ust scene of beauty, majesty, and’ glory.
Who reared this vast arch over our heads? Who
adorned it with so many shining objects, placed at such
immense distanceslfrom each other,lregular in their
motions, invariably observing the laws to which they
were originally subjected? Who placed the sun at
such a convenient distance as not to annoy, but refresh

us ? Who, for so many ages, has caused him to rise and

set at ﬁxed times? Whose hand directs, and whose
power restrains him in his course, causing him to pro-
duce the agreeable changes of day and night, as well
as the variety of seasons ?

Theorder, harmony, and regularity in the revolutions

, of the heavenly bodies, are such incontestible proofs ‘of

the existence of God, that an eminent poet well said,
“ An undevout astronomer is mad.’,’ In _the time of
Cicero, when the knowledge of astronomy was very im-
perfect, he did not hesitate to declare, that in his opin-
ion the man who asserted the heavenly bodies Were not
framed and moved by a divine understanding, was him-

self void of all understanding. -Well indeed is it said,
that the heavens declare the glory of God. ' i
V This great Being is every where present. He ex-
ists all around us. He is not-, as we are apt to imagine,
at a great distance. Wherever we turn, his image
meets our view. We see him in the earth, in’ the
ocean, in the air, in the sun, moon, and stars. We
feel h'1m in ourselves. He is always working round us 3
he performs the greatest operations, produces the no-
blest effects, discovers himself in a thousand different
ways, and yet the real GOD remains unseen. All
parts of creation are equally under his inspection.
Though he warms the breast of the highest angel in
heaven, yet he breathes life into. the meanest insect on
earth. He lives through all his works, supporting all
by the word of his power. He shines in the ver tire

that clothes the plains, in the lily that delights the vale, .

and in the forest that Waves on the mountain. He
supports the slender reed that trembles in the breeze,
andthe sturdy oak that ‘defies the tempest. His pres-
ence cheers the inanimate creation.

Far in the wilderness, where human eye never saw,

‘where the savage foot never trod, there he bids the

blooming forest smile, and the blushing rose opens its
leaves to the morning sun. There he causes the feath-
ered inhabitants‘ to whistle their wild notes to the list-
ening ’ trees and echoing mountains. There nature
lives in all her wanton wildness. There the ravished
eye,‘ hurrying from scene to scene, is lost in one vast
blush of beauty. From the dark stream that rolls
through the forest, the silver-scaled ﬁsh leap up, and
dumbly mean the praise of God. Though man remain
silent, yet God will have praise. He regards, observes,
upholds, connects, and equals all.

The belief of his existence is not a point of mere spec-
ulation and amusement. It is of inconceivable import-
ance to our present, as well as future felicity. But
while we believethere is a God, we should be extreme-

ly‘ careful to ascertain, with as much accuracy as possi— ,

202 THE COLUMBIAN ‘CSRATOR.

ble, what is his real nature. The most prominent fea-
tures of this are exhibited in that incomprehensible dis-
play of wisdom, power, and goodness, -made in the
works of creation. A virtuous man stands in a rela-
tion to God which is peculiarly delightful. The divine
perfections are all engaged, in his defence. He feels
powerful in God’s power, wise in his wisdom, good in
his oodness. ,

_ he vicious man, on the contrary, stands in a rela-
tion to God, which is of all things the most dreadful.
He is unwilling to know that God has sufficient wisdom
to search out all his wickedness, sufficient goodness
to the universe to determine to.punish that wigkedness,
and suﬂicient power to execute that determination. A
ﬁrm belief in the existence of God will heighten all
the enjoyments of life, and, by conforming our hearts
to his will, will secure ‘the approbation of a good con-
science, and inspire us with the hopes of ablessed im-
mortality. r ,

Never be tempted to disbelieve the existence of God,
when every thin around you proclaims it in a language
too plain notto be understood. Never cast your eyes
on creation without having your souls expanded with
this sentiment, “ There is a God.” VVhen you sur-
vey this globe of earth, with all its appendages; when
you behold it inhabited by numberless ranks of crea-
tures, allmoving in their proper spheres, all verging
to their proper ends‘, all animated by the same great
source of life, all supported at the same great bounte-
ous table; when» you behold not only the earth, but
the ocean and the air, swarming with living creatures,
"all happy in their situation; when you behold yonder
sun darting an etfulgent blaze‘ of glory over’ the heav-

- ens. garnishing mighty worlds, and waking ten thousand

songs of praise; when you behold unnumbered sys-
tems diffused through vast immensity, clothed in splen-
dour, and rolling in majesty ; when you behold these
things, your affections will rise above all the vanities
of time ; your full souls will struggle. with ecstacy, and

l your reason, passions, and feelings, all united, will rush

up to the skies, with a devout acknowledgment of the
existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.

Let us behold him‘, let us wonder, let us praise‘ and
adore. These things will make us happy. They will
wean us from vice, and attach us to virtue. As a be-
lief of the existence of God. is a fundamental point of
salvation, he who denies it runs the greatest conceivable
hazard. He resigns the satisfaction of a good conscience,
quits the hopes of ahappy immortality, and exposes
himself to destruction. All this for what? for the

{short-lived pleasures of a riotous, dissolute life. How

wretched, when he ﬁnds his atheistical conﬁdence to-
tally disappointed ! Instead of his beloved sleep and in-'

sensibility, with which _he so fondly ﬂattered. himself,’

he will ﬁnd himself still existing after death, removed
to a strange‘ place; he will then ﬁnd that there is a
God, who will not suffer his rational creatures to fall
into annihilation as a refuge from the just punishment
of their crimes ; he will ﬁnd himself doomed to dragon
a wretched train of existence in unavailing woe and
lamentation. Alas ! how astonished will he be to ﬁnd
himself plunged in the abyss of ruin and desperation!
God forbid that any of us should act so unwisely as to
disbelieve, when ‘every thing around us proclaims his
existence !: a - ‘

can tell one, at a semicolon two, at a colon three, and
at a full period four. And as these points are either
accommodated to the several parts of the same sen-
tence, as the first three ; or different sentences, as the
last ; this occasions the different length of the pause,
by which either the dependence of what precedes upon
that which follows, or its distinction from it is repre-
sented.

It is not in our power to give ourselves what qual-ll’
ities of the voice we please; but only to make the

best use we can of what nature has bestowed upon us.
However, several defects of the voice are capable of
being helped by care and proper means; as, on the“
other hand, the best voice may be greatly hurt by ill
management and indiscretion. Temperance is a great
preservative of the voice, and all excess is hi hly prej-
udicial to it. The voice must necessarily su er, ifvthe
organs of speech have not their proper tone. A strong
voice is very serviceable to an orator, because, if he
want some other advantages, he is,»however, capable to
make himself heard. And if at any time he is forced
to strain it, he is in less danger of its failing him before
he has ﬁnished his discourse.

But he, who has a weak voice, should be very care-
ful not to strain it, especially at first. He ought to be-
gin slow, and rise gradually to such a pitch as the key
of his voice will well carry him, without being obliged
to sink again afterwards. Frequent inﬂections~ of
the voice will likewise be some assistance to him. But
especially he should take care to speak deliberately,
and ease his voice, by allowing due time for respira-
tion at all the proper pauses. , It is an extreme much
less inconvenient for such a person rather to speak too
slow, than too fast. But this defect ofa weak voice is

sometimes capable of being helped by the use of pro-"

pct‘ nwtlmcls; as is evident from the instance of De-
tnostlwnes, before mentioned.

Priiices, dominions, arch-angelic thrones,
Imperial lords! These were your titles once;
By these names ye were known above the stars:
Shame not your ancient tiignities, nor sink
Beneath the vilest of the sons of men,
Whisperers, informers, spies. If Christ be God,
Fight, as becometh you to ﬁght, with God:

We are their gods; they feed us with their blood, V
Their sons and daughters they, make pass through ﬁre
To do us grace : if their own ﬂesh they give,

Shall they withhold to sacriﬁce a foe?

Twelve tribes were all Jehovah had on earth,

And ten are lost; of this small remnant, few

And wretched are the friends that league with Heav’n.
And where is new Christ’s promis’d reign on earth?
When God’s'own servants rise against his.Son,
And those, to whom the promises were giv’n,
Revolt from their Messias, can we wish

Greater revenge? What need have we to tempt
Those, who have hearts rebellious as our own,

Let God arise to vengeance; let him pour
Destruction on his temple", whose proud height

Let him not leave one stone upon another,

As his rash Son hath menac’d; let his wrath
Through all tlr’ inhospitable earth disperse,

Whose virgin birth credulity scarce owvns,
And nature disavows. - Praised to all time,
Immortal as himself be the renown
Of that wise spirit, who shall devise the means
By force or fraud to overthrov the power
Of this mysterious foe: what shall I say?
Priest, Prophet, Kirlg, Messias, Son of God?
Yet how God's unity, wvhich well we know
Endures,no second, should adopt a Son,
And essence indivisible divide,
Baffles my weak conjecture.  Let that pass.
To such hard doctrines I subscribe no faith:

Gives sentence of mortality upon him.
Meanwhile let circumspection on our part
Fill all the anxious interim; alarm
Rome's ealousy; stir up the captious spleen
Of the proud Pharisee; beset him round
With snares to catch him; urge the envious priests,
For envy still beneath the altar lurks;
And note the man he trusts. Mammon could tell,
Thouglh Mammon boasts not of his own success,
How few of human mould have yet withstood
His glittering, golden lures. The sword can kill
Mall's body; gold destroys his very soul.
Yet mark me well, I counsel not to tempt
The Master; poverty can do no more
Than his owvn mortifying penance does,
IIunger and thirst and odbstinately starve,
When his mere wish could make the rock a spring,
And its hard fragments, bread.  Yet sure I am
All are not Christ's in heart, who with their lips
Confess him; these are men, and therefore frail,
Frail and corruptible. And let none say,
Fear prompts this counsel; I disclaim all fear

EXTRACT FROM Mn. PITT’s SPEECH IN THE BRITISH ‘

APARLIAMENT, MAY 13, 1777.

Mr Loans, e - 
THIS is a ﬂying moment; perhaps but six weeks
left to arrest the dangers that surround us. It is
ditﬁcult for government, after all that has passed, to
shake hands with deﬁers of the king, deﬁers of the par-

liament, deﬁers of the people. I am a deﬁer of nobody ; ,

but if an end is not put to this war, there" is an end to

this kingdom. 1 do not trust my judgment in my pres-G

ent state of health; this is the judgment of my better
days; the result of forty years attention to America.
They are rebels! but what are they rebels for? Surely
not for defendingtheir unquestionable rights! What

have these rebels done heretofore C’ I remember when .

they raised four regiments on their own bottom, and

took Louisbourg from the veteran troops of France.
But their excesses have been great! I do not mean

their panegyric; but must observe, in extenuation, the

‘erroneous and infatuated counsels, which’ have pre-

vailed. The door to mercy and justice ‘has"been shut
against them. But they may still be taken up upon the
rrounds of their former submission. I state to you the

A importance of America ; it is a double market; a market

of consumption, and a market of supply. This double
market for millions with naval stores, you are giving
to your hereditary rival. - -

America has carried you through four wars, and will
now carry you tosyour death, if you do not take things
in time. In the sportsman’s phrase, when you have

THE COLUMBLAN ORATOR. i 215

found yourselves at fault, you must try back. You have
ransacked every corner of lower Saxony; but forty
thousand German boors never can conquer ten times
the number of British freemen. They may ravage;
they cannot conquer. But you would conquer, you
say ! Why, what would you conquer? the map of Ame-
rica? I am ready to meet any general officer on the
subject. - . \

What will you do out of the protection of your
ﬂeet ? In the winter, if tocrether, they -are starved;
and if dispersed, they are taiien off in detail.  I am ex-
perienced in spring hopes and -vernal promises. I
know what ministers throw out; but at last will come
your equinoctial disappointment. They tell you
what? That your army will be as strong as it‘ was
last‘ year, when it was nofstrong enou h. . You have
gained nothing in America but stations. on have been
three years teaching them the art of war. They are
apt scholars; and I will venture to tell your lordships,
that the American gentry will make oflicers enough, ﬁt
to command the troops of all the European powers.
What you have sent there are too many to make peace,
too few to make war. 1

If you conquer them,-what then? You cannot make
them res ect you; on cannot make them wearyour
cloth. ou will pant an invincible hatred in their
breasts against you. Coming from the stock they do,
they can never respect you. If ministers are founded
in saying there is no sort of treaty with France, there
is still a moment left ; the point of honor is still safe.
France must be as self destroying as England, to make
a treaty while you are giving her America, at the ex-
pense of twelve millions a year. The intercourse has

produced every thing to France; and England, poor

old England must pay for all.
I have at different times made .diti‘erent propositions,

~ adapted to the circumstances in which they were offer-

ed. The plan contained in the former bill’ is now im-
practicable, the present motion will tell you where

210 i ~ THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

you are,’ and what you have now to depend upon. It
maytproduce a respectable division in America, and una-
nimity at home. It will give America an option: she

i‘ has yet made no option. You have said, Lay down

your arms, and she has given you the Spartan answer,
3‘ Come and take them.” *

Iwill get out of my bed, on Monday, to move for
an immediate redress of all their grievances, and for
continuing to them the right of disposing of their own
property. This will be the herald of peace ; this will
open the wayifor treaty; this will show that parliament
is sincerely disposed. Yet still much must be left to
treaty. ‘ Should you conquer this people, you conquer
under the cannon of France ; under a masked battery
then ready to open» The moment a treaty with France
appears, you must declare War, though you had only
ﬁve ships of the line in England 2 but France will defer
a treaty as long as possible. ~ ‘"

You are now at the mercy of every little German
chancery ; and the pretensions of France will increase
daily, so as to become an- avowed party in either peace
or war. We have tried for ‘unconditional submission 3
let us try what can be gained by unconditional re-
dress. Less dignity will be lost in the repeal, than in
submitting to the demands of German chanccries. We
are the a gressors. We have invaded them. We
have invaded them as much as the Spanish armada in-
yaded England. Mercy cannot do ‘harm ; it will seat
the king where he ought toibe, throned on the hearts
of his people ;' and millions at home and abroad, now
employed in obloquy or revolt, would then pray for

afterwards, run into a very irregular and confused man-

ner of expr ssing their words; either by misplacinv the
accent, confounding the sound of the letters, orﬁ1ud-
dling the syllables one upon another, so as to render
what" they say often unintelligible. Indeed, sometimes
this arises from a natural defect, as in the case of De-

mosthenes ; who found a method to rectify that, as well?
as the weakness of his voice. But in faults of this

kind, which proceed from habit, doubtless the most
likely way. to mend them is to speak deliberately.

or GESTURE.

By this is ‘meant, a suitable conformity of the mo-

tions _of the countenance, and several parts of the body’

in speaking, to the subject matter of the discourse. It
is n-ot agreed among the learned, whether voice or ges-
ture has the greater inﬂuence upon us. But as the
latter affects us by the eye as the former does by the
ear, gesture in the nature of it seems to have this ad-
vantage, that it conveys the impression more speedily
to theimind; for the sight is the quickest of all our
senses. Nor is its inﬂuence less upon our passions;
nay, in some instances, it appears to act more power-
fully. A cast of the eye will express desire in as
moving a manner as the softest language ; and a differ-
ent motion of it, resentment. . ’

To wring thethands, tear the hair, or strike the
breast, are all strong indications of sorrow. And he,
who claps his hand to his sword, throws us into a
glreater panic than one who only threatens to kill us.

ON THE DAY or JUDGMENT.

T midnight, when mankind are Wrap’c_l in peace,
And worldly fancy feeds on goldenélreams;

To give more dread to man’s most dreadful hour;
At midnight, ’tis presum’d, this pomp will burst
From tenfolddarkness; sudden as the spark

From smitten steel; from nitrous grain the blaze.
Man, starting from his couch, shall sleep no more!
The day is broke which never moreshall close!
Above,»around, beneath, amazement all! *

Terror and glory join’d in their extremes !

Our God in grandeur, and our world on ﬁre !

All nature struggling in the pangs of death!

Dost thou not hear her? Dost thou not deplore
Her strong convulsions, and her ﬁnal groan?
Where are we now? Ah me ! the ground is gone,
On which we stood, LORENZO! while thou mayst
Provide more ﬁrm support, or sink forever!
Where? how? from whence? vain hope! It is too la
Where, where, for shelter, shall the guilty ﬂy,
When consternation turns the good man pale?

Great. day! for which all other days were made ;_

For which earth rose from chaos, man from earth,
And an eternity, the date of gods,

Descended on poor earth-created man!

Great day of dread, decision, and despair!
Atthought of thee, each sublunary wish

Lets go its eager grasp, and drops the world;

And catches at each reed of hope in’heav’n.

At thought‘ of thee! And art thou absent then,
LORENZO! no; ’tis here; it is begun;

Already is begun the grand assize,

In thee, in all. Deputed conscience scales

The dread tribunal, and forestals our doom :
Forestals; and, by forestalling, proves it sure.
Why on himself should rpgn void judgment pass? I

,ls idle nature laughing at her sons?
Who conscience sent, her sentence will support,
And God above assert that God in man.

Thrice happy they, who enter now the court
HeaV’n opens in their bosoms: but, how rare!
Ah me ! that magnanimity how rare ! _
What hero, like the man who stands himself;
Who dares to meet his naked heart alone ;

Who hears, intrepid, the full charge it brings,
Resolv’d to silence future murmurs there?

The coward ﬂies; and ﬂying is undone.

(Art thoua coward? N o.) The coward ﬂies ; 9
Thinks, butlthinks slightly; asks, but fears to know ,~
Asks “ What is truth '2” with Pilate; and retires;
Dissolves the court, and mingles with the throng;
Asylum sad! from reason, hope, and heaven!

Shall all, but man, look out with ardent eye,
For that great day, which was ordain’d for man ?
0 day of consummation ! Mark supreme
(If men are wise) of human thought! nor least,
Or inthe sight of angels, or their King!

An els, whose radiant circles, height o’er height,
Or er o’er order rising, blaze o’er blaze,

As in a theatre, surround this scene,

Intent on man, and anxious for his fate :

To vindicate his glory ; and for thee,

To disinvolve ‘the moral world, and give

To Nature’s renovation brighter charms.

Carri: Dear Lionel, do explain to me what has hap-

it important and triﬂing twenty times in a minute.

I’ll withdraw till she has done. Don’t despise me,
Camilla. I am confounded sorry, I assure you. [Go-

the whole I had better tell it you myself: for she’ll
make such a dismal ditty of it, that it won’t be over
this half year. The sooner we have done with it the
better. It will only put you out of spirits. You
must know I was in rather a bad scrape at Oxford last
year

Cam. Last year! and you never told us of it before 3

Lion. O, ’twas about something you would not un-
derstand; so I shall not mention particulars now. It
isenough for you to know, that two or three of us
wanted a little cash! Well, so—--—in short, I sent a
letter—somewhat of a threatening sort—-to old uncle
Relviil; and——-

Lion. O, I did not sign it. It was only beggino‘ a
little money, which he can afford to spare very weil;
and just telling him, if he did not send it to a certain

lace which I mentioned, he would have his brains
lown out.
V Cam. I-low horrible!

"Lion. Poh, poh; he had only to send the money,
you know, and then his brains might keep their place.
Besides, you can’t suppose there was gunpowder in the
words; though, to be sure, the letter was char ed with
a few vollies of oaths. But, would you be ieve it!
the poor old gull was fool enough actually to send the
money where he was directed.

you speak in such disgraceful terms of that worthy

Lion. ‘My dear little chicken, don’t be so precise
and old maidish. Don’t you know it’s a relief to a
man’s mind to swear a few cutting oaths now and then,

 

.when he’s in a passion? when all the time he would

no more do harm to the people he swears at, than you
would, who mince out all your words as if you were

i very wicked trick ; and I would give half my little ﬁn-

er that Lhad not done it., But it’s over now, you
now; so what signiﬁes making the worst of it?

Cam. And did he not discover you?

Lion. N o; Itgave him particular orders, in my
letter, not to attempt any thing of that sort ; assuring
him there were spies about him to watch his proceedings.
The good old simpleton took it all for gospel. So -there
the matter ended. -However, as ill luck would have it,

Lion. Why, my dear, it was only taking a little of

 

imy own fortune beforehand, for I am his heir; so we

all agreed it was merely robbing myself ;- for we had
several consultations about it; and one of us is to be a

lawyer.

Cam. But you give me some pleasure here , forl
had never heard that my uncle had made you his heir.

Lion. Neither had I, my deary; but I takevit for
granted. Besides, our little lawyer put it intomy head.
Well, we wrote again‘, and told the poor old soul, for
which I assure you I am heartilypenitent, that, if hedid

his family were in bed and asleep. Now don’t make
faces nor shruggings; for I promise you, I think al-
ready I deserve to be hung for giving him the fright;
though I would not really have hurt the hair of his
head for half his fortune. But who could have guess-
ed that the old codger would have bitten so readily?
The money, however, came; and we thought the
business all secure, and agreed to get the same sum an-
mially.
- Cam. Annually! O horrible!

Lion. Yes, my darling. You have no conception
how convenient it would have been for our extra ex-
penses. But unluckily, [uncle grew worse, and went
abroad; and then consulted with some crab of a friend,
and that friend, with some demagogue of a magistrate,
and so all’ is now blown. However,’ we had managed
it so cleverly, that it cost them nearly three months to
ﬁnd it out; owing, I must confess, to poor uncle’s cow-
ardice, in not making his in uiries before the‘ money
was carried off, and he himse f beyond the sea. The
other particulars Lavinia must give you; for I have
talked of it now till I have made myself quite sick.

Do tell me some divertingmstory to drive it a little out

of my head. But, by the way, pray what has carried
the old folks to‘Cleves ? Have they gone to tell this sad
tale to uncle Hugh, so that I might losehim too?

Lav. N 0; your afﬁicted parents are determined

a not to name it. They are striving that nobody else

shall know any thing of the matter, except Dr. March-
mont. . ‘
Lion. Well, they are good souls, it must be acknowl-
edged. I wish I deserved them better. I wish too it
was not such plaguy dull business to be good. I con-
fess, girls, it wounds my conscience to think how I

who is not so well -able to bear it. But when one IS
at Oxford, or in London-—-your merry blades there, I
can’t deny it, my dear sisters, your merry blades there

such genuine sport among them. I cannot, for my life,
keep out of the way. Besides, you have no concep-
tion, young ladies, what a bye-word you soon become
among them, if they ﬁnd you ﬁinching. But this is
little to the purpose; for you know nothing of life yet,
poor things. '

Lav. I would not for the world say any thing to
pain you, my dear brother; but if this is what you
call life, I wish we never might know any thing of it.
I wish more, that you had been so happy as never to
have known it. You pity our ignorance, We pity your
folly. How strangely infatuated you are! But yet]
will hope, that, in future, your first study will be to re-
sist such dangerous examples, and to shun such unwor-
thy friends. Pray reﬂect one moment on the distressing
situation of your dear parents, who cannot endure
your-‘presence, through the poignancy of grief! What
abours and hardships has your poor father encountered,
to gain wherewithal to support you at the University?
And what is your return! Such, my dear brother, as will
soon bring down his grey hairs with sorrow to the grave.
As for your poor mother, it is quite uncertain whether
any of us ever, see her again, as your much injured
uncle has sent for her over sea to attend him in his sick-
ness ; and to-morrow she sets out. She has left it in
solemn charge with me, to deliver you a message from
her, which, if you have any sensibility remaining, will
cut you to the heart. ‘ ,

Lion. I know she can have said nothing worse than I
expect, or than I merit. Probe me, then, Lavinia, with-
out delay. Kee me not in a moment’s suspense. I
feel a load of gui t upon me, and begin sincerely to re-

thing, in order to supply you. .

Lion. Yes, yes; but suppose I Want it for a purpose
that is not proper, how am I to get it then? «

Cam. Why, then, my dear Lionel, surely you must
be sensible you fought to go without it.

Lion. Aye, that’s as you girls say, who know noth-
ing of the matter. If a young man, when he goes
into the world, were to make such a speech as that, he
would be pointed at. Besides, whom must he live
with? You don’t suppose he is to shut himself up,
witha few musty books, sleeping over the fire, under
pretence of study, all day long, do you? like young
Melmond, who knows no more of the world than either
of you? I

Cam. Indeed, he seems to me an amiable and modest

young man, though very romantic.
Lion. O, I dare say he does! I could have laid any
wager of that. He’s just a girl’s man, just the very
thing, all sentiment, and poetry, and heroics. But we,
my little dear, yve lads of spirit, hold all that amazingly
cheap. I assure you, I would as soon be seen trying
on a lady’s cap at a glass, as poring over a crazy old
author. I warrant you think, Because one is at the
University, one must be a book-worm‘.

226 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

Lav. Why, what else do you go there for but to
study ? L. . V

Lion. Every thing else in the world, my dear.
. Cam. But are there not sometimes young men who
are scholars, without being book-worms_ ?‘ Is not Ed-
gar Mandlebert such an one ? 7

Lion. 0 yes, yes ; an odd thing of that sort happens

now and then. Mandlebert has spirit enough to carry ’

it off pretty well, without being ridiculous ; though he
is as deep, for his time, as e’er an old fellow ofa col-
lege. But then this is no rule for others. You must

- not expect an Edgar Mandlebert at every turn, my

dear innocent creatures. , _
Lav. But Edgar has had an extraordinary educa-
tion, as well as possessing extraordinary talents and
oodness; you too, my dear Lionel, to fulﬁl what may
he expected from you, should look back to your father,
who was brought_up at the same University, and is
now considered as one of the ﬁrst men it has produced.
While he was’ respected by the learned for his ap-
plication, he was 'loved -even by the indolent for his
candour and kindness of heart. And though his.in-
come, as you know, wasvery small, he never ran in

debt; and by an exact but open economy, escaped all

imputation of meanness.

Lion. Yes ; but all this is nothing to the purpose.
My father is no more like other men than ‘if he had
been born in another planet; and my attempting to
resemble him would be as .great a joke”, as if you were
to dress up in Indiana’s ﬂowers and feathers, and ex-
pect people to_.call you a beaut . I was born a bit of
a buck; and have no manner oiy natural taste for study,
and poring, and expounding, and black-lettér work. I
am a light, airy spark, at your service, ladies; not
quite so’ wise as I’-am merry; lam one of your ec-
centric geniuses; but let that pass, My father, you

know, is ﬁrm as a rock. He minds. neither wind nor,-

weather, nor ﬂeerer nor sneerer, nor joker nor jeerer;
but his ﬁrmness he has kept all to himself; not a whit

have performed every part by gestures only, without‘

Words, in a way very intelligible.

Butrwith respect to oratory, gesture may very prop-
erly be called the. second part’ of pronunciation; in
which, as the voice should be suited to the impressions
‘itreceives from the mind, so the several motions of the
body ought to be accommodated to the various tones
and inﬁections of the voice. When the Voice is even
and moderate, little gesture is required; and nothing
is more unnatural than violent motion, in discoursin
upon ordinary and_familiar subjects. , The motions of
the body should rise therefore in proportion to the ve-
hemence and energy of the expression, as the natural
and genuine effect of it. '

But as gesture is very diﬁerent and various as to the
manner of it, which depends upon the decent conduct
of several parts of the body, it will not be amiss to con-
sider more particularly the proper management of each
of those parts. Now all gesture is either natural, or
from imitation. By natural gesture, we mean such

actionsiand motions of the body, as naturally accom- .

pany our Words, as these do the impressions of our
mind. ,And these either respect the whole body, or
some particular part of it. ~

The speaker should not long continue standing in
the same position, like a statue, but be constantly
changing, “though the motion be very moderate. There‘
ought to be no appearance of stiffness, but a certain
ease and pliableness, naturally, suiting itself to every
expression; by which means, whena greater degree
of motion is necessary, it will appear less sudden and
vehement :, for as the raising, sinkin , and various in-
tﬂections of the voice must "be gra ual, so likewise
should the‘ motions of the body. It is only on some
particular occasions that a hasty vehemence and imipe-‘
tuosity is proper in either case.’ i * r V

As to the several parts of the body, the headis the most
considerable. To lift it up too high has the air of arro-
gance and pride; to stretch it out too far, orthrow it

about, and gives me a new direction. But with all my
father’s ﬁrmness and knowledge, I very much doubt
whether he knows any thing of ~real,life. That isthe
main thing, my dear hearts. But, come, Lavinia, ﬁn-
ish your message.

Lav. My mother says, the fraud you have practised,
whether from wanton folly to give pain, or from ra-
pacious discontent to get money, she will leave with-
out comment ; satisﬁed that if youhave any feeling at
all, its effects must bring remorse; since it has danger-
ously increased the inﬁrmities of your uncle, driven
him to a foreignland, and forced your mother to for-
sake her home and family in his pursuit, unless she were
"willing to see you punished by the entire disinheritance
with which you are threatened. ‘But \

notion at the beginning he would have minded the let-

ﬂower of one’s life, all to be sacriﬁced to plodding over
musty grammars and lexicons, merely to cut a ﬁgure
just for about two minutes, once or twice in a year?

example of what a hard thinrr it is to learn to do welﬁ
after one has been accustomedho do evil. How volatile!
how totally void of all stability! One minute you ex-
hibit appearances of repentance and reformation, and
the next minute, all fair prospects vanish. How I la-
ment that you were so early exposed to a vicious World,

Lion. Forbear,‘ Camilla. You hurt me too much.
You excite those severe twinges of remorse, which, I
am obliged to own, I have never been wholly free from,
since I joined my merry companions,and began to learn
the world. Notwithstanding my gaiety, and my appar-
ent contentment, I confess there is something within,
which constantly admonishes me of my errors ,and makes
me feel unhappy: so that, if ‘ it were not for fashion’3
sake, I can truly say, I could wish I were in your re-
cluse situation; here to remain, in my once pleasant
abode, and never more mingle with the world.

Lav. Dear brother, I cannot leave you, without

once more calling your attention to your parents, your;

family, and your friends. Think of their present situ-
a’tion. If you have no regard for your own character,
your present, or future happiness, I entreat you to have
some pity for them. Let not the tyrant fashion bring
you into abject slavery. Pardon me when I tell you,
our )retended friends are your worst enemies. They
ave led you into a path which will carry you directly
to inevitable ruin, unless ou immediately forsake it.

so much despise. Believe me, my dear brother, it is a
knowledge, which, by your own confession, never has
produced you any happiness, nor will it ever ; but will
guide you to Wretchedness and misery.
Lion. My dear sisters,I am convinced. Your words
have pierced my very soul. I am now wretched and
I deserve to be so. I am determined from this moment
to begin my reformation, and, with the assistance of
Heaven, to complete it. Never more will I see my
vile companions, who have enticed me to go such
lengths in wickedness. What do I not owe to my
am'iable_sisters for their friendly and seasonable advice !
‘I will go directly to my father, and, like the prodigal
son, fall on my knees before him, beg his forgiveness,
and put myself entirely under his direction and instruc-
tion ; and, so long as I live, I never will offend him again.

lutions!

I IF.any, against all these proofs which have been

offered‘, ‘should maintain that the peace with the
Indians will be stable without the Western Posts, to
them I will ur e another reply. From arguments cal-
culated to produce conviction, I will appeal directly to
the hearts of those who hear me, and ask whether it is
not already planted there? I resort especially to the
convictions of the Western gentlemen, whether, sup-
posing no Posts and no Treaty, the settlers will remain
in security ? Can they take it upon them to say, that
an Indian peace, under these circumstances, will prove
ﬁrm? No, Sir, it will not be eace, but a sword; it
will be no better than a lure to diaw victims within the
reach of ‘thetomahawk. ‘

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 231

On this theme, my emotions are unutterable. If I
could ﬁnd words for them, if my powers bore any pro-
portion to my zeal, I would swell my voice to such a
note of remonstrance, it should reach “every log-house
beyond the mountains. I would say to the inhabitants,
Wake from your false security. Your cruel dangers,
your more cruel apprehensions are soon to be renewed.
The wounds, yet unhealed, are to be torn open again.
In the day time, your path through the woods will be
ambushed. The darkness of midnight will glitter with
the blaze of your dwellings. You are a father; the
blood of your sons shall ofatten your cornﬁeld. You
are a mother; the war—whoop shall wake the sleep of
the cradle; _ ‘

On thissubject you need not suspect any deception
on your,‘ feelings. It is a spectacle of horror which
cannot be overdrawn. If you have nature in your

‘hearts, they will speak a language, compared, with

which, all} have said or can say, will be poor and
frigid. Will it be whispered that the treaty has made
me a new champion for the protection of the frontiers ’?

uniformly given in conformity with the ideas I have

‘expressed. , Protection is the right of the frontiers; it

is_ our duty to give its

 Who will accuse me of wandering out of the subject ?
Whowill say that I exaggerate the tendencies. of our
measures ? Will any one answer by a sneer, that all this
is idle preaching? Will any one deny that We are
bound, and I would hope to good purpose, by the most
solemn sanctions of duty for the vote we give? Are
despots alone to be reproached forunfeelingindifierence
to the tears and blood of their subjects .9 Are republi-
cans unresponsible? Have the principles on which you
ground the reproach upon cabinets and kings no prac-

tical inﬂuence, no binding force? Are they merely

themes of idle declamation, introduced to decorate the
morality of a newspaper essay, or to furnish pretty top-’
ics of harangue from the windows of that State—house?

232 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

I trust it is neither too presumptuous nor too late to
ask, Can you put the dearest interest of society at risk,
without guilt, and without remorse ?

By rejecting the posts, we light the savage ﬁres-,
We bind the victims. This day we undertake to ren-
der account to the widows and orphans whom our de-
cision will make, to the wretches that will be roasted
at the stake, to our country, and I do not deem it too
serious to say, to conscience, and to God. We are an-
swerable ; and if duty be any thing more than a word
of imposture; if conscience be not a bugbear, we are
preparing to make ourselves as wretched as our country.

There is no mistake in this case; there can be none.
Experience has already been the prophet of events,
and the cries of our future victims have already reached
us. The Western inhabitants are not a silent and un-
complaining sacriﬁce. The voice of humanity issues

from the shade of the wilderness. It exclaims, that-
‘ while one hand is held up to reject this treaty, the
other grasps a tomahawk. It summons our imagina-

tion to the scenes that will open. It isino great eﬂbrt
of the imagination to conceive that_ events so near are
already begun. I can fancy that I listen to the yells
of savage vengeance and the shrieks of torture. Al-
ready they seem to sigh in the western wind; already
they mingle with every echo from the mountains.

Let me cheer the mind, weary, no doubt, and ready
to despond on this prospect, by presenting another,
which is yet in our power to realize. Is it possible for
a real American to look at the prosperity of this coun-
try without some desire for its continuance, without
some respect for the measures, which, many will say,
produced, and all will confess, have preserved it ? Will
he not feel some dread that a chan e of system will re-
verse the scene? The well-grounded fears of our citi-
zens, in~1794, were removed by the treaty, but are not
forgotten. Then they deemed war nearly inevitable;
and would not this adjustment have been considered at
that day as a happy escape from the calamity?

THE COLUMBIAN ‘ORATOR. 233

The great interest and the general desire of our peo-
ple was to enjoy the advantages“ of neutrality. This
instrument, however misrepresented, affords America:
that inestimable security. The causes of our disputes
are either Cut up by the roots, or referred to a new
negociation, after the end of the European war. ..This

was gaining every thing, because it conﬁrmed our new L»

trality, by which our citizens are gaining every thing.

This alone would justify the engagements of the ov~ «

ernrnent. F or, when the ﬁery vapours of the war ow-
ered in the skirtswof our horizon, all ourwishes were
concentered in this one, that we might escape the des~
olation of the storm. This treaty, like a rainbow on
the edge of the cloud, marked _to our eyes the space
where it was raging, and afforded at the same time the
sure prognostic of fair weather. If we reject it, the
vivid colours will grow pale ; it will be a‘ baleful meteor
portending tempest and war. ~

_ Let us not hesitate then to agree to the appropriatioii,

‘to carry it into faithful execution. Thus we shall save

‘ u

the faith of our nation, secure its peace, and diffuse the
spirit of conﬁdence and enterprise that will augment
its prosperit . The progress of wealth and improve-
ment is wonderful, and, some will think, too rapid.
The, ﬁeld for exertion is fruitful and vast; and if peace

and good government should be preserved, the acquisi- V

tions of our citizens are not so pleasing as the proofs
of their industry, as the instruments of their future suc-
cess. The rewards of exertion go to augment its power.
Proﬁt is every hour becoming capital. The vast crop‘
of our neutrality is all seed wheat, and is sown again,
to swell, almost beyond calculation, the future harvest
of prosperity. And in this progress, what seems to be

. fiction is found to fall short of experience.

EXTRACT rnom AN ORATION, PRONOQNCED AT Won-
CESTER, (MASS.) JULY 4, 1796; BY FRANCIS
BLAKE, ESQ.

N viewing the causes which led to the event of this
joyous anniversary; in tracing the effects which
have resulted to America ; in searching for the princi-
ples which impelled to the contest; in recalling the
feelings which supported us in the struggle, it cannot
fail to occur to us that the causes have not been con-
ﬁned’ to the, limits of our continent; that the effects
have extended far beyond the boundaries of our nation;
that the glorious example, with electrical rapidity, has
ﬂashed across the Atlantic; that, guided by the same
principles, conducted by the same feelings, the people,
who so gallantly fought and bled for the security-~of

. our lives and our liberties, are now ﬁghting and bleed-

ing in defence of their own.

On this day, therefore, religiously devotedto the
consecration of our independence, it becomes us, as
the votaries of freedom, as friends to the rights of man,
and bound to support them whenever invaded, to turn
our attention, with a grateful enthusiasm, to the scenes
of their sufferings, their revolt, and their victories.
While exulting in the full enjoyment of peace and tran-
quillity, shall not a tear for the unexampled distresses
of this magnanimous nation, check, for a moment, the
emotions of our joy?

They have sworn that they will live FREE or DIE .
They have solemnly sworn, that the sword, which has
been drawn in defence of their country, shall never be
returned to its scabbard, till it has secured to them vic-
tory and freedom‘. Let us then breathe forth a fervent
ejaculation to Heaven, that their vows may be remem-
bered ; that the cause of our former. allies may not be

deserted, till they have scourged their invaders, ﬁn
they have driven them back in confusion to the regions
of terror, from whence they emerged. '

While we remember with horror the continued effu-
sionof blood, which darkened the ‘morning of their
revolution, let us not forget that their vengeance was
roused by the champions of despotism,whose lives have
since justly atoned for the crimes they committed.
‘While we lament the sanguinary scenes, which clouded
its progress, let it not be forgotten that they arose from
the bloody manifesto of a band of tyrants, combined
for the hellish purpose of again rivetting the chains
they had broken. 

The league of Pilnitz, like the league of Satan and
his angels, revolting against the Majesty of heaven,
was professedly fabricated, to arrest forever the pro-
gress of freedom; to usurp the dominion of France,
and divide the spoil among this band of royal plunder-
ers. Have we not heard, that the noble, the generous,
the grateful monarch of the forest, that fawned at the
feet of Androcles, when remembering his former friend-
ship, will ever turn with fury on his pursuers; and
when robbed of his whelps, rests not till his fangs are
crimsoned in the blood of the aggressor?

Shall then the fervour of our friendship be abated, by
remembering the transitory frenzy of a people distract-

’. ed with the enthusiasm of freedom, and irritated to

madness by the dreadful prospect of losing what they
had enjoyed but for a moment‘? Let it never be said
of. us, as of Rome and of Athens, that ingratitutle is the
common vice of republics. Was‘ it to the. crowned
monarch, named Louis the Sixteenth, or to the people
of France, that we were indebted, for the blood and
treasure that were so profusely lavished in our cause?
Shall then their services be forgotten, in the remem-
brance of their momentary excesses? or shall we re-

. fuse our most cordial concurrence in the feelings which

impel them to the present contest with the ruflian po-
tentates of Europe?

_ 236 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

Can we doubt, for a moment, which is the cause we
are bound to support with our sanction, when we behold
the winds and the sees, those dreadful ministers of Hea-
ven’s ven eance, commissioned to advance their pro-
gress, ang deluge their enemies? When we behold
Ariel, with his attendant spirits, gently hovering over
their navies, and wafting them to victory on the bosom
of the ocean; while Neptune and Boreas have com-
bined against the league of their oppressors, to over-
whelm in the deep these deluded followers of Pharaoh!
Have we not seen them fed, as with manna from ‘hea-
ven; the waters divided, and the walls of Jericho fall-
in before them, while the fair prospect of liberty has
led them in triumph through the wilderness, as a cloud
by day, and a pillar of ﬁre by night?

AMERICANS! Let us join in a fervent supplica-
tion, that the sacred charters of humanity, which we
have once sealed with our blood, may be forever pre-
served from the deadly grasp of tyrants.

FRENCHMEN! Be ﬁrm; be undaunted in the
struggle you have thus miraculously supported. Evince
to the World, now gazing with admiration at your ex-
ploits in the ﬁeld of battle, that you have virtue equal
to your courage; that you are friends to the friends of
humanity‘; that your arms are nerved only against the
enemies of man. Let not the sacred name of LIBER-
TY be polluted by the frenzy of licentious passions;
but may your present glorious constitution, while it
protects your freedom from the ‘unhallowed ravages of
tyranny, remain an unshaken bulwark against the de-
structive-fury of faction. ~

TYRAN TS! Turn from the impious work of blood
in which your hands are imbrued, and tremble at the
des eration of your revolting subjects ! repent in sack‘-
clot and ashes. For behold, ye, who have been ex-
alted up to heaven, shall, ere long, be cast down to hell!
The ﬁnal period of your crimes is rapidly approaching.

back,lool<s clownish and unmannerly; to hang it down-
wards on the breast,.shows an unmanly bashfulness and
want of spirit: and to suﬁer it to lean on either shoul-
der, argues both sloth and indolence. Wherefore, in
calm and sedate discourse, it ought to keep its natural
state, and upright posture. . However, it should not be

long without motion, nor yet always moving; but _.
gently turn sometimes on one side, and sometimes on
the other, as occasion requires, that the voice may be .

heard by all who are present; and then return again
to its natural position. It should always accompany
the other actions of the body, and turn on the same
side with them; except when aversion to any thing is
expressed; which is done by stretching out the right
hand, and turning the head to the left. '

But it is the countenance, that chieﬂy represents both
the passions and dispositions of the mind. By this We
express love, hatred, joy, sorrow, modesty, and con-
ﬁdence : by this we supplicate, threaten, soothe, invite,
forbid, consent, or refuse ; and all this without speaking.
Nay, from hence we form a judgment not only of a per-
son’s present temper, but of his capacity and natural
disposition. And therefore it is common to say, such
a one has a “ promising countenance,” or that“ he
promises little by his countenance.” It is true, this is
no certain rule of judging; nor is it in the power of
any one to alter the natural make of his countenance.

But the several parts of the face bear their part, and

‘Contribute to the proper and decent motion of the

whole. In a calm and sedate discourse, all the features
retain their natural state and situation. In sorrow
the forehead and eyebrows lour, and the cheeks hang
down. But in expressions of joy and cheerfulness,
the forehead and eyebrows are expanded, the cheeks
contracted, and the corners of the mouth dra.wn up-
wards. Anger and resentment contract the forehead,
draw the brows together, and thrust out the lips. And
terror elevates both the brows and forehead. As these

COLLEGE, ON COMMENCEMENT DAY, 1795.

FROM Patagonia’s snow-invested wilds,

To Darien, where‘constant‘ve1-dure smiles,
The Andes meet the morning’s earliest ray,
O’erlook the clouds and check the ﬂood of Day.
In copious torrents from their eastern side,

Flow the vast streams of Amazonia’s tide,

Roll on majestic throixgh her boundless plain,
And swell the surface of the neighbouring main.
Nor Plata less a broad, deep channel ﬁlls ;
Danube and Wolga by his side were rills.

But leave, my muse, this wide-extended clime,
By nature stamp’d with all she owns sublime.
H-ere she has Wrought upon her largest plan,

But mourns in solitude the wrongs of man.

Here Gautemozin writh’d in ﬂames of ﬁre,

And slaughter’d millions round their prince expire.
Rise, sleeping vengeance ! vindicate their cause ;
And thou, stern justice, execute thy laws:

Ye Andes, strike Hesperian fraud with dread,
Burst thy volcanoes on the guilty head!

Where Cancer’s sun pours down his ardent blaze,

Draws the Monsoons, and lengthens out his days,

. The" spacious gulf of Mexic’ rolls his tide,

And thronging ﬂeets of various nations ride.
The fertile isles their rich luxuriance pour,
And Western dainties crown the eastern shore.~

238 T THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

But weep, humanity, the black disgrace,

And spread thy blushes o’er oppression’s face!

Ye sons of mirth, your bowls, your richest food,

ls mingled with fraternal tears and blood.

Still groans the slave beneath his master’s rod,

But. nature, wrong’d, appeals to nature’s GOD.
The sun frowns angry at th’ inhuman sight;

The stars, offended, redden in the night:

In western skies, drear horror gathers round,

And waking vengeance murmurs under ground ; ,
O’er all the gulph the dark’ning vapou_rs rise,

And the black clouds sail awful round the skies.
From heaven to earth swift thunder bolts are hurl’d,
And storm’s dread demon shakes th’ astonish’d world.
The rich plantation lies a barren waste,

And all the works of slavery are defac’d.

Ye tyrants, own the devastation just ;

’T is for your wrongs the fertile earth is curs’d.

, Columbia’s States unfold their milder scenes,
And freedom’s realms afford more pleasing themes.
From Georgiafs plains, to Hudson’s highest source,
The northern Andes range their varied course: i
Rank above rank, they swell their growing size, 
Rear their blue arches, and invade the skies._

Here spreads a forest; there a city shines:

Here swell the hills, and there a vale declines.
Here, through the meads, meand’ring rivers run;
There placid lakes reflect the full orb’d sun.

From mountain sides perennial fountains" ﬂow,‘
And streams majestic bend their course below.
Here rise the groves ; there Opes the fertile lawn, _
Fresh fragrance breathes, and Ceres waves her corn.
Along the east, where the proud billows roar,
Capacious harbours grace the winding shore :

The nation’s splendour and the merchant’s pride
Wafts with each gale, and ﬂoats with ev’ry tide. V
From Iroquois to vast Superiour’s strand, .
Spread the wide lakes and‘ insulate the land.

Hail, happy States! thine is the blissful seat,
Where nature’s gifts and art’s improvements meet.
Thy temp’rate air breathes health ; thy fertile soil
In copious plenty pays the labourer’s toil.

Ask not for mountains of Peruvian ore,

Nor court the dust that shines on Afric’s shore.
The plough explores for thee the richest mine;

When federal laws beyond the line shaﬁ sway.
Where Spanish indolence inactive lies,

And ev’ry art and ev’ry virtue dies;

Where pride and avarice their empire hold,
Ignobly great, and poor amid their gold,
Colur'r'ibia’s genius shall the mind inspire,

And ﬁll each breast with patriotic ﬁre.

Nor east nor western oceans shall conﬁne

The tyrant blast, and liberate the slave.

Plenty and peace shall spread from pole to pole,

DIALOGUE BETWEEN A MASTER AND SLAVE.

OW, villain! what have ou to sa for
‘Master’ -N this second attempt to iiun away}? Is
there any punishment that you do not deserve?
Slave. I Well know that nothing I can say will
avail. I submit to my fate.
Mast. But are you not a base fellow, a hardened
and ungrateful rascal?
Slave. I am a slave. That is answer enough.
Mast. I am not content with that answer. I
thought I discerned in you some tokens of a mind su-

periour to your condition. I treated you accordingly..

You have been comfortably fed and lodged, not over-

worked, and attended with the most humane care when.-

you were sick. And is this the return?

Slave. Since you condescend to talk with me, as
man to man, I will reply. What have you done, what
can you do for me, that will compensate for the liberty
which you have taken away?

Mast. I did not take it away. You_ were a slave
when I fairly purchased you.

Slave. Did I give my consent to the purchase ?

.Mast. You had no consent to give. You had al-
ready lost the ri ht of disposing of yourself.

Slave. I had Iost the power, but how the right ?‘ I
was treacherously kidnapped in my own country, when
following an honest occupation. I was ut in chains,
sold to one of your countrymen, Carrie by force on
board his ship, brought hither, and exposed to sale like
a beast in the market, where you bought me. What
step. in all this progress of violence and injustice can

ive a right? Was it in the villain who stole me, in
t ie slave-merchant who tempted him to do so, or in
you who encouraged the slave-merchant to bring his
cargo of human cattle to cultivate your lands?

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 241

’ .Ma:st. It is in the order of Providence that one man
should become subservient to another. It ever has
been so, and ever will be. I found the custom, and
did not make it.

Slave. You cannot but be sensible, that the robber
who puts a pistol to your breast may make just the same
plea. Providence gives him a power over your life and
property; it gave my enemies a power over my liberty.
But it has also given me legs to escape with ; and What
should prevent me from usin them ? Nay, what should
restrain me from retaliating t e wrongsl have suﬂered,
if a favourable occasion should offer ?

Jilast. Gratitude! I repeat, gratitude! Have I not
endeavoured eversinee I possessed you to alleviate your
misfortunes by kind treatment; and does that confer
no obligation ‘.7 Consider how much worse your condi-
tion might have been under another master.

Slave. You have done nothing for me more than
for our Working cattle. Are they not well fed and
ten ed? do you work them harder than your slaves ?
is not the rule of treating both designctl only for your
own advantage? You treat both your men and beast
slaves better than some of your neighbours, because you
are more prudent and wealthy than they.

Mast. You might add, more humane too.

Slave. Humane! Does it deserve that appellation
to keep your fellow-men in forced subjection, deprived
of all exercise of their free will, liable to all the inju-
ries that your own caprice, or the brutality of your
overseers, may heap on them, and devoted, soul and
body, only to your pleasure and emolument? Can
gratitude take p ace between creatures in such a state,
and the tyrant who holds them in it? Look at these
limbs; are they not those of a man? Think that 1
have the spirit of a man too.

.Ma§st. But it was my intention not only to make
your life tolerably comfortable at present, but to pro-
vide for you in your old age.

21

242 » ,THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

Slave. Alas! is a“ life like mine, torn from Country, '

friends, and all I held dear, and compelled to toil un-
der the burning sun for a master, worth thinking about
for old age C’ No; the sooner it ends, the sooner I shall
obtain that relief for which my soul pants.

Mast. Is it impossible, then, to hold you by any ties
but those of constraint and severity ?

Slave. It is impossible to make one, who has felt the
value of freedom, acquiesce in being a slave.

Mast. Suppose I were to restore you to your liberty,
would you reckon that a favour?

Slave. The g1'eat'est; for although it would only
be undoing a wrong, I know too well how few among
mankind are capable of sacriﬁcing ‘interest to justice,
not to prize the exertion when it is made. ‘

Mast. I do it, then; be free.

Slave. Now I am indeed your servant, thou h not
your slave. And as the first return I can malg<e for
your kindness, I will tell you freely the condition in
which you live. You are surrounded with implacable
foes, who long for a safe opportunity to revenge upon
you and the other planters all the miseries they have
endured. The more generous their natures, the more
indignant they feel against that cruel injustice which
has dragged them hither, and doomed them to perpet-
ual servitude. «You can rely on no kindness on your
part, to soften the ﬂobduracy of their resentment. You

« ave reduced them to the state of brute beasts ; and if

they have not the stupidity of beasts of burden, they
must have the ferocity of beasts of prey. Superior force
alone can give you security. As soon as that fails,
you are at the mercy of the merciless. Such is the
social bond between master and slave!

Pmr or MR. O’CoNNoa’s SPEECH IN THE IRISH
House or COMMONS, IN FAVOUR OF THE BILL FOR
EMANCIPATING THE_ ROMAN CATHOLIC-S, 1795.

IF I were to judge from the dead silence with which

my speech has been received, Ishould suspect that
what I have said was not very palatable to some men
in this House. But I have not risked connexions, en-
deared to me by every tie of blood and friendship, to
support one set of men in preference to another. I
have hazarded too much, by the part I have taken, to

O allow the breath of calurnny to taint the objects I have

had in view. ‘Immutable principles, on which the
happiness and liberty of my countrymen depend, con-

ivey-t'o my mind the ‘only substantial boon for which

” to the decide

great sacriﬁces should be made. _

And I here avow myself the zealous and earnest
advocate for the most unqualiﬁed emancipation of my
catholic countrymen; in the hope and conviction, that
the monopoly of the rights and liberties’ of my country,
which has hitherto effectually withstood the efforts of
a part of the dpeople, must yield to the unanimous will,

interest, and to the general eﬂbrtof a
whole united people. Itis from this conviction, and

I. it is for that transcendently important object, that,

while the noble Lord and the Right Honorable Secre-
tary, are offering to risk their lives and fortunes in sup-
port‘_of' a system that militates against the ‘liberty of my
countrymen, I will risk every thing dear to me on earth.

It is for this ‘great object I have, I fear, more than
risked Connexions dearer to me than life itself. But
he must be a spiritless man, and this a spiritless nation,
not to resent the baseness of a British Minister, who has

' raised our hopes in order to seduce a rival to share with

him the disgrace of this accursed political crusade, and

- blast them afterwards, that he may degrade acompetitor

to the station of a dependent. And, that he may de-
stroy friendship which his nature never knew, he has
sported‘With the feelings of a whole nation. Raising
the cup with one hand to the parched lip of expectancy,
he has dashed it _to the earth with the other, in all the
wantonness of insult, and with all the aggravation of
contempt.

Does he imagine, that the people of this country,
after he has tantalized them with the cheering hope of
present alleviation, and of future prosperity, will tamely
bear tobe forced,to a re-endurance of their former
sufferings, and to a re-appointment of their former
spoilers ?- Does he, from conﬁdence of long success in
debauching the human mind, exact from you, calling
yourselves the representatives of the people of Ireland,
to reject a bill, which has received the unanimous con-
sent of your constituents? or does he mean to puzzle
the versatile disposition of this House, on which he has
made so many successful experiments already, by dis-
tracting you between obedience to ‘his imperious man-
dates, and obedience to the will of the peopleyou
should represent? « e i ‘ it

Or does he ﬂatter himself, that he shall now succeed,
because he has succeeded in betraying his own country,
into exchanging that peace, by which she might have
retrieved her shattered ﬁnances, for a war, in which he
has squandered twenty times a greater treasure, in the

course of two years, than with all hisfamed economy,

he had been able to save, in the course often? for a
war in whichithe prime youth of the world have been
offered up, victims to his ambition and his schemes, as
boundless and presumptuous, as ill-concerted and ill-
combined ; for a war in which the plains of every nation
in Europe have been crimsoned with oceans of blood;
fora war in which his country has reaped nothing but
disgrace, and which must ultimatelyyprove her ruin?
Does he ﬂatter himself, that he shall be enabled,
Satan like, to end his political career by involving the
Whole empire in a‘ civil war, from which nothing can

I trust the people of England are too wise and too just‘
to attempt to force measures upon us which they would
themselves reject with disdain. I trust they have not
themselves so soon forgotten the lesson they so recently
learned from‘America, which should serve as a lasting
example to nations, against employing force toisubdue
the spirit of a people, determined to be free!

But if they should be so weak, or so wicked, ‘as to
suffer themselves to be seduced by a man, to whose
soul, duplicity and ﬁnesse are as congenial, as ingenuous-
ness and fair dealing is a stranger, to become the instru-
ments of supporting a few odious public characters in

A powerand rapacity, against the interest and against the

sense of a whole people; if we are to he dragooned
into measures against our will, by a nation that would
lose her last life, and expend her last guinea, in resent-
jng a similar insult, if offered to herself, Itrust she will
ﬁnd in the people of this country a spirit in no Wise in-
‘ferior to her own. i ‘ « a

You are at this moment at the most awful period of
your lives. The Minister of England has committed
you with your country; and on this night your adop-
tion or rejection of this bill, must_ determine, in the
eyesof the Irish nation,» which you represent, the Min-
ister of England, or the people of Ireland! And, al-
though you are convinced. you do not represent the
people of Ireland ; although you are convinced, every

, man ofyou’, that you are self-created, it does not alter

the nature of the contest ; it is still a contest between
. the vMinister of England and the peo le of Ireland;
and the weakness of your title shoul only make you
the more circumspect in the exercise of your power.
Fortunately, the views of the British Minister have
‘been detected ; fortunately, the people of this country
see him in his true colours. Liléethe desperate gamester,
who has lost his all, in the wildest schemes of a gran-
dizem-ent, he looks round for some dupe to supp y him
with the further means of future projects; and in the

crafty subtleness of his soul, he fondly imagines, he has
found that easy dupe in the credulity of the Irish nation.
After he has exhausted his own country in a crusade
against that phantom, political opinion, he ﬂatters him-
self he shall be enabled to resuscitate her at the ex-
pense of yours.

As you value the peace and happiness of your coun-
try; as you value the rights and liberties of the soil
that has given you birth; and if you are not lost to
every sense of feeling for your own consequence and
importance as men, I call on you this night to make
your stand. I call on you to rally round the independ-
ence of your country, Whose existence has been so
artfully assailed. Believe me, the BritishMinister will
leave you in the lurch, when he sees that the people
of this nation are too much in earnest to be tricked out
of their rights, or the independence of their country.

What a display of legislation have we had on this
night ? Artiﬁcers who neither know the foundation on
which they work, the instruments they ought to use,
nor the materials required! Is it on the narrow basis
of monopoly and exclusion you would erect a temple
to the growingliberty of your country? If you will
legislate; know, that on the broad basis of immutable
justice only, you can raise a lasting, beauteous temple to
the liberty of your island; whose ample base shall lodge,
and whose roof shall shelter her united family from the
ranklin-g inclemency of rejection and exclusion. Know,
that reason is that silken thread by which the lawgivet
leads his people; and above all, know, that in the
knowledge of the temper of thepublic mind, consists
the skill and the wisdom of the legislator.

Do not imagine that the minds of your countrymen

have been stationary, while that of all Europe has been ’

rapidly prorrressive ; for you must be blind not to per-

_ ceive, that e whole European mind has undergone a

revolution, neither conﬁned to this nor to that country;
but as general as the great causes which have given it

; birth, and still continue to. feed its growth. In vain do

are the naturalsigns of such passions, the orator should
endeavour to conform to them. ’ ,

But as the eyes are most active and signiﬁcant, it is
the advice of Cicero that the greatest care should be

taken in their management. And he gives this reason t

for it. “‘ Because other parts of the countenancehave
but few motions; whereas all the passions of the soul
are ex.pressed in the eyes, by so many different actions;
which cannot possibly be represented by any gestures

of the body, ‘if the eyes are kept in a ‘ﬁxed posture.” ’
Common experience does ina great measure conﬁrm

the truth of this observation. We readily guess at a
person’s intention, or how he is affected to us by his
eyes. And any sudden change or emotion of the mind
is presently _followed by an alteration in the look.

In speaking, therefore, upon ‘pleasant and delightful

subjects, the eyes are brisk and cheerful; as, on the,

contrary, they sink and are languidlin delivering any
thing melancholy and sorrowful. This is ‘so agreeable
to nature, that before a person speaks, we are prepared
with the expectation of one or the other fromthis dif-
ferent aspect. So likewise in anger, a certain vehee
menceand intenseness appears in the eyes, which, for
want of proper words to express it by, we endeavour
to represent by metaphors taken from ﬁre, the-most

violent and rapid element ; and say in such cases, the ,

eyes sparkle, burn, or are inﬂamed. In expressions
of hatred or detestation, it is natural to alter the looks,
either by turning the eyes aside, or downwards. ’ _
Indeed, the eyes are sometimes turned downwards
uponpother occasions,asv to express modesty. And if at
any time a particular object be addressed, whatever it
be, the eyes should be turned that way. And there-'

fore Philostratus very deservedly ridicules a certain”
rhetorician as guilty of solecism in gesture, who, uppn

saying, 0 Jupiter! turned his eyes downwards; and
when he said, 0 Earth! looked upward. A staring
look has the" appearance of giddiness and want of

thought: and to contract the eyes gives suspicion 0 L

these men, who subsist but on the abuses of the govern-
ment under which they live, ﬂatter themselves, that
what we have seen these last six years is but the fever
of the moment, which will pass away as soon as the pa-
tient has been let blood enough.

As well may they attem t to alter the course of na-
ture, without altering her laws. If they would effect
a counter revolution in the European mind, they must
destroy commerce and its effects ; they must abolish ev-
ery trace of the mariner’s compass; they must consign
every book to the flames; they must obliterate every
vestige of the invention of the press; they must destroy
the conduit of intelligence, by destroying the institu-
tion of the post oliice. Then, and not till then, they
and their abuses may live on, in all the security
which.ignorance_, superstition, and want of concert in
the people can bestow‘.

But while I would overwhelm with despair those
men who have been nursed in the l. ) of venality and
prostitution; who have been educated in contempt and
ridicule of a love for their country ; and who have
{grown grey in scofﬁng at every thinﬁ like public spirit,

et me congratulate every true frien to mankind, that
that commerce, which has begotten so much independ-
ence, will continue to be et more ; and let me congratu-
late every friend to the human species, that the press,
which has sent such a mass of information into the
World, will continue, with accelerated rapidity, to
pour forth its treasures so beneficial to mankind.

Itis to these great causes we are indebted, that the
combination of priests and despots, which so long ty~
rannized over the civil and political liberty of Europe,
has been dissolved. It is to these rcat causes we are
indebted, that no priest, be his re igion what it may,
dares preach the doctrine which inculcates the necessity
of sacriﬁcing every right and every blessing this world
can atlbrd, as the only mean of obtaining eternal hap~
piness in the life to come.

248 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

This was the doctrine by which the despotism of
Europe was so long supported; this was the doctrine
by which the political popery of Europe was supported;
but the doctrine and the despotism may now sleep in
the same grave, until the trumpet of ignorance, super-
stition, and bigotry, shall sound their resurrection.

By justice, and by -mercy ; and to raise

My trophies on the blessings of mankind:

Nor would I buy the empire of the world

With ruin of the people Whom I sway,

t On forfeit of my honor.

Baj. Prophet, I thank‘ thee.

Confusion! couldst thou robgme of my glory

To dress up this tame king, this preaching dervise!
Unﬁt for war, thou shouldst have liV’d secure

In lazy peace, and with debating senates

Shar’d a precarious sceptre; sat tamely still,

And let bold factions canton out thy power

And wrangle for the spoils they robb’d thee of;

gWhilst I, (O blast thepower that stops my ardour)
Would, like a tempest, rush amidst the nations,

Be greatly terrible, and deal, like Alha, ~
My angry thunder on the frighted world.
Tom. The world! ?twould be too little for thy pride :
Thou Wouldst scale heaV’n. '
Baj. I Would. Away! my soul
Disdains thy conference.
Tam. Thou vain, rash thing, ,
That, with gigantic insolence, has dar’d
To lift thy wretched self above the stars, .
And mate with power almighty, thou art fall’n!
Baj. ’Tis false! I am~not fall’n from aught I have
been!

' At least my soul resolves to keep her state,

And scorns to make acquaintance with ill fortune.
Tam. Almost beneath my pity art thou fall’n ;‘
Since, while the avenging hand of HeaV’n is on thee,

And presses to the dust thy swelling soul,
Fool-hardy, with the stronger thou contendest.
To what vastheights had thy tumultuous temper

Been hu1'ry’d, if success had croWn’d thy wishes!
Say, what had I to expect, if thou hadst conquer-’d?
Baj. Oh; glorious thought ! Ye pow’rs, I will enjoy it,

Though but in fancy; imagination shall _
Make room to entertain the vast idea.

Oh! had I been the master but of yesterday,

The world, the world had felt me; and for thee,

I had us’d thee, as thou art to me, a dog,

The object of my scorn and mortal hatred. .

1 would have cag’d thee for the scorn of slaves.

I would have taught thy neck to know my weight,
And mounted from that footstool to the saddle;

Till thou hadst begg’d to die ; and e’en that mercy

I had deny’d thee. Now thou know’st my mind,
And question me no farther. ‘ ~

Tam. Well dost thou teachme

What justice should exact from thee. Mankind,
With one consent, cry out for vengeance on thee;
Loudly the call to cut off this league—breaker,

This Wild estroyer, from the face of earth.

Baj. Do it, and rid thy shaking soul at once
01' its worst fear.
Tam. Why slept the thunder

That should have arm’d the idol deity,

And given thee power, ere yesterysun was set,

To shake the soul of Tamerlane. Hadst thou an arm
To make thee fear’d, thou shouldst have prov’d it on me,
Amidst the sweat and blood of yonder ﬁeld,

When, through the tumult of the warl sought thee,

F enc’d in with nations.

That fated us to different scenes of slaughter!
Oh! could my sword have met thee!
Tam. Thou hadst then, a

As now, been in my power, and held thy life

De endent on my gift., Yes, Bajazet,

I bid thee live. So much my soul disdains

That thou shouldst think I can ‘fear aught but Heaven.
Nay more ; couldst thou forget thy brutal ﬁerceness,

252 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

And form thyself to manhood, lwould bid thee
Live and be still a king, that thou mayst learn
What man should be to man
This royal tent, with such of thy domestics

As can be found, shall wait upon thy service;
Nor will Iuse my fortune to demand

Hard terms of peace ; but such as thou mayst offer
With honor, I with honor may receive.

 

COLONEL BAnRE’_s SPEECH IN THE BRITISH PARLIA-
MENT, 1765, on THE STAMP-ACT BILL.

J

ON the first reading of the bill, Mr. Townsend
, spoke in its favour; and concluded with the fol—
lowing words: “ And will these Americans, children
planted by our care; nourished up by our indulgence,
until they are grown to a degree of strength and opu-
ience ;, and protected by our arms ; will they grudge

to contribute their mite, "to relieve us from the heavy

weight of that but-then which we lie under?”

On this Colonel Barre rose, andanswered Mr. Towns-
end in the following masterly manner.

“They planted by YOUR care !” No; your op-
pressions planted them in America. They ﬂed from
your tyranny, to a then uncultivated and unhospitable
country, where they exposed themselves to» almost all
the hardships to which human nature is liable; and
among others, to the cruelties of a savage fee, the most
subtle, and Iwill take upon me to say, the most for-
midable of any people upon the face of the earth; and
yet, actuated by principles of true English liberty, they
met all hardships with pleasure, compared with those
they suffered in their own country, from the hands of
those who should have been their friends. i

“ They nourished up by your indulgence !” They
grew by your neglect of them. As soon as you began
to care about them, that care was exercised in sending

persons to rule them, in one department and another,
who were, perhaps, the deputies of deputies to some
members of this House, sent to spy out their liberties,
to misrepresent their actions, and to prey upon them ;
men. whose behaviour, on many occasions, has caused
the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil Within them;

,men promoted to" the highest seat of justice; some,

who, to my knowledge, were glad, by going to a for-
eign country, to escape being brought to the bar of a
court of justice in their own.

“ They protected by YOUR arms!” They have
nobly taken up arms in your defence; have exerted a
valour, amidst their constant and laborious industry, for
the defence of a country, whose frontier was drenched
in blood, while its interior parts yielded all its little.
savings to your emoluments. ‘ ,

And, believe me; remember I this day told you so,
that the same spirit of freedom, which actuated that
people at first, will accompany them still. But pm-
dence forbids me to explain myself further. Heaven
knows, I do not at this time speak from motives of
party heat; what 1 deliver are the genuine sentiments
of my heart.

However superiour to me in general knowledge and
experience the respectable body of this House may be,
yet Iclaim to know more of America «than most of
you, having seen and been conversant in that country.
The people, I believe, are as truly loyal as any subjects
the king has; but a people jealous of their liberties,
and who will vindicate them, if ever theyshould be
violated. But the subject is too delicate, I will sageno

more.

/THE LAST DAY.
Ex'ri‘tAc'r mom A MANUSCRIPT POEM.

THE day of Doom, the all-important day,

— Ising; that link extreme of time, which joins
The measur’d chain of days, and months, and years,
To one eternal, one efliilgent day:

Day to the children of the day ; but night,

Eternal night, to all the sons of darkness. .

The time aﬂix’d by God’s decree arrives. .
Th’ Almighty spake: heav’n open’d wide’ her gates:
The herald, Gabriel, far advanc’d in front, , ‘
Rais’d on seraphic wings, ﬁrst issued forth.

N _Xt,the Creation’s Sire, veil’d in a cloud

0? awful gloom, from which red Iightnings ﬂash’d,

And rending thunders roar’d, pass’d through the gates.

At his right hand sat his eternal Son,

High rais’d upon a golden throne emboss’d

With gems, that sparkled through the cloud. Angels
And saints, the countless host of those, who hold T
The realms of bliss, next in procession mov’d :

T Nor could the wide-extended space from Aries

To the scales, that poise the hemispheres,
Contain the army of the skies. ’
The earth had never seen a larger host,

Than when the foe of Greece spread o’er the land
And sea from Hebrus to Thermopylaa ;

But this was small, compar’d with what the heavens
Now saw, as earth is small compar’d with heaven.
The numerous stars,that hold their course along
The milky-way, and in the neighb’ring skies,

No sooner saw their Maker cloth’d in storms,

And felt his thunder shake their solid spheres,
Than trembling they retire ; as when some king
Enrag’d frowns on his slaves, who ﬂee his face,
Till he commands them stand and hear his will.
So had the frighted stars ﬂed oil‘ and left i

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 255

The mundane space all void, had not the trump
Of Gabriel interpos’d, and with a voice

More loud, than ever yet creation heard,
Impress’d the mandatesof all nature’s God

Upon all nature’s works. Ye stars! (said -he)
Return, and hold your station in your orbs;

There stand and see what He on earth transacts
This day, and witness how He deals with man.
Thou sun! who from the birth of time hast roll’d
Thy chariot round the world, and shed thy beams
Alike on all mankind, look on and see

The equal justice of thy God to man

Outshine thy equal rays. T h’ ailrighted earth
Took the alarm of heav’n: the atmosphere
Assay’d to ﬂee upon the wings of storm.

Fierce tempests beat the lofty mountains’, sides,
Sweep forests down, and spread destruction o’er
The works of man. The troubled ocean heaves :
His surging billows mingle with the clouds:

His deepest caverns lie expos’d to view.

The earth, convuls’d from her deep centre, heaves.
Order forsook the world: discord spread wide.
The confus’d elements again had _join’d

The listless empire of primeval chaos, -
Had not harmonic sounds assuag’d their tumult.

Spirit divine ! thou soul of harmony

In heaven and earth,breathe through my lines and speak
The power of music’s charms, when heavenly love
VVarm’d every breast of angels, scraphim,

And doubly glow’d in the Al1nighty’s Son;

And robes of peace, prepar’d to meet his bride.
The lightnings ceas’d ; the thunders died, when he
Complacent smil’d. Gabriel, and all thechoir
Of heaven, said he, hush the commoved world,
And wake thepsleeping saints with sounds of peace.
His words like melting music ﬂow’d: his face,
More radiant than the vernal morn, that smiles
Theearth to joy. The trump of Gabriel led _

The choral song: unnumber’d harps of gold,
And voices sweet join’d the melodious sound.
Discord, that late had mov’d the elements

To war, and ’gan t’ invade the spheres, ~

Was hush’d to sleep. Quick chang’d the scene,
From raging discord, universal storm,

To soothing sounds, and universal calm.

The sun, from blackest clouds, unveil’d his face,
And shone with double radiance on the earth.
The ﬁxed stars had ceas’d to shed their beams‘,
And trembling, hid in sable darkness, stood;
But now, enra tur’d with syrnphonious sounds,
They dart their genial rays, and till their orbs
With pleasing light, and soul-reviving warmth. t
But thou, 0 Earth, most felt the pleasing change.
Fierce storms were mute.

Old ocean heard, and smooth’d his tempest face;
And spring-like beauty smil’d on all the earth.

Poets have sung of Orpheus’ potent lyre;

Eurydice, forc’d from the bands of death,

Of bending trees and moving rocks obsequious

« To the sound. “But now whole worlds obey. -

Death could not hold his victims in the tomb

“ Thou monarch of the grave, resign the just!
Awake! ye saints, from your long night of sleep,
Adorn’d with ever-blooming youth and robes

Of heavenly innocence. Salute the mom

Of everlasting day.” Thus sung the choir.
Death’s dreary mansions heard with sad dismay.
In the mid regions of eternal night,

There sits the ghastly monarch on his throne.
Substantial darkness ﬁlls the broad domain:
Heart-chilling vapours rise from noxious lakes.
His servants, War, I ntemp’rance, Plague, Revenge,

‘Consumption, wrinkled Age, groan discord round

His throne, and offer up their loathsome fumes
Of putrid corps, conta ion, dead’ning blasts ;
Sweet incense to their ring; or run before

therefore, in common, most suitable ; always directed

tention.

As to the other parts of the body distinct from the ‘

head, the shoulders ought not to be elevated; for this
is not only in itself indecent ; but it likewise contracts
the neck, and hinders the proper motion of the head.
Nor, on the other hand, should they be drawn down
and depressed; because this occasions a stiﬁhess both
to the neck and the whole body. Their natural pos-
ture therefore is best, as being most easy and grace-
ful. To shrug the shoulders has an abject and servile
air; and frequently to heave them upwards and down-
wards is a very disagreeable sight. A continued mo-
tion of the arms any way, is by all means to be avoid-
ed. Their action should generally be very moderate,
and follow that of the hands; unless in very pathetic
expressions, where it may be proper to give them a

Enter STEPHEN’.

ADIES and entlemen, you have rob-
Ste-phem L ably heard if Foote, the comedialii: if
not,’ it is out of my power to tell you any thing about
him, exceptthis; he had but one leg, and his name
was Samuel. Or, to speak more poetically, one leg
he had, and Samuel was his name. This Foote wrote
a farce, called the Alderman; in which he attempted
to ridicule a well-fed magistrate of the city of London.
This last, hearing of the intended alfrqnt, called upon
the player,» and threatened him severely for his pre-
sumption. Sir, says Foote, it is my business to take off
people. You shall see how well I can take myself oil}
So out of the room he went, as though to prepare.
The Alderman sat waiting, and waiting, and Waiting,

his own liking. You are all wondering what this
story leads to. Why, P11 tell you; Foote’s farce was

all other pieces, of nouns, pronouns, verbs, participles,
adverbs,co,n_junctions, articles, adjectives, prepositions,
and ‘ interjections. N ow, words are very harmless
things; though I confess that much depends upon the
manner of putting them together. The only thing to
be settled is, that, if you should dislike the arrange-
ment, you will please to. alter it, till it suits you.
' Enter TRUEMAN.

Trueman. What are you prating about at such a rate ?

Staph. I am speaking of Sam Foote, and prepositions,
and adverbs, and many other great characters. ‘
Tm. Now, don’t you y know, that your‘ unruly

tongue will be the ruin of you ? Did you ever see a man

who was foaming and frothing at the mouth as you are,
that ever said any thing to the purpose ?. You ought

‘ always to think before you speak, and to consider well

to whom you speak, and the place and time of speaking.
‘Staph. Pray who taught you all this worldly wisdom ?

Tm. My own experience, Sir; which is said to be

the best school-master in the world, and ought to teach
itito every man of common sense.

Staph. Then, do not imagine that you possess any
great secret’. “Keep your tongue between your teeth”
is an old proverb, rusted and crusted over, till nobody
can tell what it was ﬁrst made of. Prudence, indeed,
teaches the same. So prudence may teach a merchant
to keep his vessels in port for fear of a storm at sea.
But, “ nothing venture, nothing have” is my proverb.
Now, suppose all the world shofildiadopt this prudence,
what a multitude of mutes we should have! There
would be an end of news, lawsuits, politics, and soci-
ety. I tell you, Sir, that busy tongues are like main
springs ; they set every thing in motion. _

Tru.rBut Where’s a man’s dignity, all this time, while
his tongue is running at random, without a single
thought to guideit? ’

' Steph. His dignity! that indeed! Out upon parole,
where it ought to be. A man’s dignity! as though
we came into the world to support dignity, and by an

affected distance, to make our friends feel their inferi-
ority. I consider men like coins, which, because
stamped with men’s heads, pass for more than they
are worth. And when the world is willing to treat
a man better than he deserves, there is a meanness in
endeavouring to extort more from them.

Tm. But shall a man speak without thinking? Did
you ever read the old proverb, “ Think twice, before
you speak once?” V

Steph. Yes, and a vile one it is. If a man speak
from the impulse of the moment, he’ll speak the mean-
ing of his heart; and will probably speak the truth.
But if he mind your musty proverb, there will be
more pros and cons in his head, more hems and haws
in his delivery, than there are letters inhis sentences.
To your sly, subtle, thinking fellows, we owe all the
lies, cheating, hypocrisy, and double dealing there
is in the world.

Tm. But you know that every subject has its sides ;
and we ought to examine, rellect, analy'1.e, sift, consider,
and determine, before we have a right to speak ; for
the world are entitled to the best of our thoughts.
VVhat would you think of a tmdesman, who should send
home your coat, boots, or hat, half finished? You
might think him a very honest-hearted fellow; but

ou’d never employ him again.

Staph. Now, was there any need of bringing in tai-
lors, cobblers, and liatters, to help you out 2’ They have

‘ nothing to do with this subject.

Tru. You don’t understand me. I say, if you

" would never employ such workmen a second time, why

should you justify a man for turning out his thouglits
half finished? The mind labours as actually in thinking

upon, and maturing a subject, as the body does in the _

ﬁeld, or on the shop-board. And, if the farmer knows
when his grain is ready for the sickle, and the mechanic,
when his work is ready for his customer, the man, who
is used to thinking, knows when he is master of his

Staph. All this is escaping the subject. None of

ou talk about a man’s’ mind, just as if it were a
piece of ground, capable of bearing ﬂax and hemp.
You have fairly brought forward a shop—board, and
mounted your tailor upon it. Now I have no notion
of any cross-legged work in» my inner man. In fact,

I don’t understand all this process of thinking. My’
knowledge upon all subjects is very near the root of my

tongue, andl feel great relief, when it gets near the tip.

Tru. Depend on it that thousands have lost fame
and even life by too great freedom "of speech.‘ Trea-
sons, murders, and robberies, have been generally dis-
covered by the imprudent boasting of the perpetrators.

Staph. Depend on it, that our world has suﬂered
far more by silent, than by prattling knaves. Suppose
every man were to speak all his thoughts, relate all his
actions, declare all his purposes, would the World be in
danger of crimes? No; be assured, that magistrates,
bailiﬁs; thief-takers, prisons, halters, and gallows, all
owe their dignity to the contrivance of your sly, plod-
ding mutes.

Tm. You have let off from the tip of your tongue
a picked company of di niﬁed substantives; but take
notice that my doctrine does not extend to the midnight
silence of robbers ; but to a« due caution, and reserve in
conveying our thoughts to the world. And this I-hope
ever to observe. And if you determine on a different
course, rest assured, that the consequences will not be
very pleasant. ’ [E:cz't.

EXTRACT raom Mn. P1T'r’s SPEECH, Nov. '18, 1777,
on AMERICAN AFFAIRS.

I RISE, my lords, to declare my sentiments on this
most solemn and serious subject. It has imposed
a load upon my mind, which, I fear, nothing can re-
move ; but which impels me to endeavour its alleviation,
by a free and unreserved communication of my senti-
ments. In the first part of the address, lhave the
honor of heartily concurring with the noble Earl who
moved it. No man feels sincerer joy than I do; none
can offer more genuine congratulation on every acces-
sion of strength to the protestant succession: I there-
fore join in every congratulation on the birth of another
princess, and the happy recovery of her Majesty.

But I must stop here ; my courtly complaisance will
carry me no farther. I will not join in congratulation
on misfortune and disgrace. I cannot concurin a
blind and servile address, which approves, and endeav-
ours to ‘sanctify, the monstrous measures that have’heap-
ed disgrace and misfortune upon us ; that have brought

rumitoioiur doors.‘ This, my lords, is a perilous and '
tremendous moinent! It is nota time for adulation._

The smoothness of ﬂattery cannot now avail ; cannot
save us in this rugged and awful crisis. It is now ne-

cessary to instruct _the throne in the language of truth.-

We must dispel the delusion and the darkne,ss_which
envelop it; and display, in its full danger arid true
colours, the ruin that it has brought to our doors.

‘ And who is the minister; where is the minister, who
has dared to suggest to the throne the contrary, un-
constitutional language, this day delivered from it?
The accustomed language from the throne has been
application to Parliament for advice, and a reliance on
its constitutional advice and assistance. As it is the
right of Parliament to _give, so it is the duty of -the
crown to ask‘ it. But on this day, and in‘ this extreme

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. F 253

momentous exigency, no reliance is reposed on our‘

constitutional counsels! no advice is asked from the
sober and enlightened care of Parliament! But the
crown, from itself, and by itself, declares an unaltera-
ble determination to pursue measures. \And What
measures, my lords? The measures‘that_have-—pr6-
duced imminent perils that threaten us; the measures
that have brought ruin to our doors. ‘

Can the Minister of the day now presume to’expect

a continuance of support, in this ruinous infatuation ? »

Can Parliament be so dead to its dignity and its duty,
as to be thus deluded into the loss of the one, and the
violation of the other? To give an unlimited credit
and support for the perseverance in measures, which
have reduced this late ﬂourishing empire to ruin and
contempt 1.,“ But yesterday, and England might have
stood against the world: now none so poor to‘ do her
re'verence.”~ Iuse the words of a poet; but thoughh

l 9

y it is poetry, it IS no ﬁction. It is a shameful ‘tru

that not only the power and strength of this country

"are wasting away and expiring; but her well-earned

glories, her true honors, and substantial dignity, are
sacriﬁced. t

France, my lords, has insulted you; she has encour-
aged and sustained America ; and whether America» be
wrong or right, the dignity of this country ought to
spurn at the ofﬁcious insult of French interference.
The ministers and ambassadors of those who are called
rebels and enemies, are in Paris ; in Paris they trans-
act the reciprocal interests of A.merica and France.

- Ca.n there be a more mortifying insult? Can even our

ministers sustain a more humiliating disgrace ? Do they
dare to resent it? Do they presume even to hint a
vindication of their honor, and the dignity of the State,
by requiring the dismissal of the plenipotentiaries ‘ of
America ?. Such is the degradation to which they have
reduced the glories of England! '
The people, whom they affect to call contemptible
rebels, but whose growingcpower has at last obtained

264 V THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

the name of enemies; the people with whom they
have engaged this country in war, and against whom
they now command our implicit support in every meas-
ure of desperate hostility: this people, despised as reb-
els, are acknowledged as enemies, are abetted against

you ; supplied with every military store ; their interests '

consulted, and their ambassadors entertained, by your
inveterate enemy! and our ministers dare‘not inter-
pose with dignity or effect. Is this the honor of a
great kingdom ? Is this the indignant spirit of England,
who, but yesterday, gave law to the house of Bour-

bon? My lords, the dignity of nations demands a deci- _

sive conduct in a situation like this. 4

This ruinous” and ignominious situation, where We
cannot act with success, nor suff'er with honor, calls
upon us to remonstrate in the strongest and loudest lan-

uage of truth, to rescue the ear of Majesty from the
delusions which surround it. The desperate state of our
arms abroad is in part known. No man thinks more
highly" of them than I do. I love and honor the En-
glish troops. I know they can achieve any thing except
impossibilities; and Iknow thatthe conquest of English
America is an impossibility. You cannot, I venture
to say it, you CANNOT conquer America.

Your armies, last year, effected every thing that
could be effected ; and what was it? It cost a numerous
army, under the command of a most able general, now
a noble lord in this House, a long and laborious cam-

paign, to expel ﬁve thousand Frenchmen from French

America. My lords, you CANNOT conquer Amer-
ica. What is your present sittiation there? We do
not know the worst; but we know, that in three

SCENE” rnom THE TRAGEDY or CATO.

CATO, LUCIUS, and Ssurnomus.

Cato ATHERS, we once again are metin council :

' Cesar’s approach has summon’d us together,
And Rome attends her fate from our resolves.
How shall we treat this bold, aspiring man?
Success still follows him, and backs his crimes :
Pharsalia gave him Rome, Ev ’pt has since
Receiv’d his yoke, and the wlnole Nile is Cesar’s.
W'h should I mention ~Juha’s overthrow,
An Scipio’s death? Numidia’s burning sands
Still smoke with blood. ’Tis time we should decree
What course to take. Our foe advances on us,
And envies us even Lyhia’s sultry deserts. -
Fathers, pronounce your thoughts; are they still ﬁx’d
To hold it out, and ﬁght it to the last ?
Or are your hearts subdued at length, and wrought
By time and ill success to a submission?
Sempronius, speak.

Sempronius. My voice is still for war.
Heav’ns! can .a Roman senate long debate
Whichof the two to choose, slav’ry or death!
No; let us rise at once, gird on our swords,
And at the head of our regnaining troops,

Attack the foe, ‘break through the thick array

Of his throng’d legions, and charge home upon him.
Perhaps some arm, more lucky than the rest,

May reach his heart, and free the world from bondage.
Rise, fathers, rise! .’tis Romedemands your help;
Rise, and revenge her slaughter”d citizens, .
Or share their fate! The corpse of half her senate

Sit here delib’rating in cold debates,

If we shall sacriﬁce our lives to honor,

Or wear them out in servitude and chains.

Rouse up, for shame! our brothers of Pharsalia ,

Great Pornpey’s shade complains that We are slow

.And Scipio’s ghost walk’s unreveng’d among us.

’ Transport thee thus beyond the bounds of reason.

True fortitude is seen in great exploits

That justice warrants, and that wisdom guides.
All else is tow’ring frenzy and distraction.

Are not the lives of those who draw the sword

ln 'Rome’s defence intrusted to our care?

Should wethus lead them to the ﬁeld of slaughter,
Might not th’ impartial World with reason say,
We lavish’d at our death the blood of thousands,
To grace our fall, and make our ruin glorious?

' Lucius, we next would know What’s your opinion?

Luc. My thoughts, I must confess, are turn’d on peace.

Already have our quarrels ﬁll’d the World

With widows, and with orphans. Scythia mourns
Our guilty wars, and earth’s remotest regions

Lie half unpeopled by the feuds of Rome.

’Tis time to sheathe the sword, and spare mankind.
it is not Cesar, but the gods, my fathers ;

The gods declare against us; repel

Our vain attempts. To urge the foe to battle,
Prompted by blind revenge, and wild despair,
Were to refuse th’ awards of Providence,

And» not to rest in Heav’n’s determination.

I sometimes thrown back. . But when the orator speaks

of himself, his right hand should be gently laid on
his breast. -

The left hand should seldom move alone, but ac-
commodate itself to the motions of the““right. In mo-
tions to the left side, the right hand should not be car-
ried beyond the left shoulder. In promises, and ex-_
pressions of compliment, the motion of the hands

should be gentle and slow; but in exhortations and

applause, more swift. The hands should generally

I be open; but in expressions of compunction and an-

ger, they may be closed. All ﬁnical and triﬂing ac-
tions of the ﬁngers ought to be avoided; nor should
they be stretched out and expanded in a stiff and rigid
posture, but kept easy and pliable. ,
The gestures we have hitherto discoursed of, are
such as naturally accompany our expressions. And

‘ we believe those We have mentioned, if duly attended

to, will be found suﬂicient to answer all the purposes

' of our modern pronunciation; The other sort of

gestures above mentioned are such as arisefrom imita-
tion 3 as where the orator describes some action',”’or
personates another speaking.’ But here great care is
to be taken not to overact his part by running into
any’ ludicrous or theatrical mimicry. It is sufficient
for him ‘to represent thin s of this nature, as may
best convey the image of t em in a lively manner to
the minds of the hearers; Without any such chan es

We took up arms, not to reven — e ourselves,

But free the commonwealth; xvlilen this end fails,
Arms have no further use : our country’s cause,

And bids us not delight in Roman blood,
Unproﬁtably shed. Wliat men could do,

ls done already. Heav’n and earth will witness,

Cato. Let us appear nor rash nor diflidcnt;

And fear, admitted into public councils,

Betrays like treason. Let us shun them both.
Fathers, I cannot see that our affairs

Are grown thus desp’rate: we have bulwarks round us :
Within our walls are troops inur’d to toil

In Afric’s heats, and season’d to the sun:
Numidia’s spacious kingdom lies behind us,
Ready to rise at its young prince’s call.

While there is hope, do not distrust the gods;
But wait at least till Cesar’s near approach
Force us to yield. "Twill never be too late

To sue for chains, and own a conqueror.

Why should Rome fall a moment ere her time?
No, let us draw our term of freedom out

In its full length, and spin it to the last;

So shall we gain still one day’s liberty:

And let me perish; but in Cato’s judgment,

A day, an hour of virtuous liberty,

is worth a whole eternity in bondage.

MERICAN S! you have a country vast in extent,
and embracing all the varieties of the most sa-
lubrious climes : held not by charters wrested from un-
willing kings, but the bountiful gift of the Author of
nature. The exuberance of your population is daily
divesting the gloomy wilderness of its rude attire, and
splendid cities rise to cheer the dreary desert. You
have a" government deservedly celebrated as “ giving
the sanctions of law to the precepts of reason ;” pre-
senting, instead of the rank luxuriance of natural licen-
tiousness, the corrected sweets of civil liberty. You
have fought the battles of freedom, and enkindled that
sacred ﬂame which now glows with vivid fervour
through the greatest empire in Europe. »
Weiindulge the sanguine hope, that her equal laws
and virtuous conduct will hereafter afford examples of

, imitationtto all surrounding nations. That the blissful

period will soon arrive when man shall be elevated to
is primitive character; when illuminated reason and
regulated liberty shall once more exhibit him in the

V image of his Maker; when all the inhabitants of the

globe shall be freemen and fellow-citizen_s,and patriot-
ism itself be lost in universal philanthrop .~ Then shall
volumes of incense incessantly roll from a tars inscribed

to liberty. Then shall the innumerable varieties of the

human race unitedly “ worship in her sacred temple,
whose pillars shall rest on the remotest corners of the
earth, and whose arch will be the vault of heaven.”

Umrsn STATES AND AN INDIAN.

. OUR friends, the inhabitants of the
White ‘Mm’ United States, wish to_ bury the tom-
ahawk, and live in peace with the Indian tribes.

Indian. Justice is the parent of peace. The Indians
love war only as they love justice. Let us en'oy our
rights, and be content with yours, and We will hang
the tomahawk and scalping-knife upon the tree of
peace, and sit down together under its branches.

W. Man. This is what we desire, and what is your
interest as well as ours to promote. VVe have often

made leagues with you; they have been as often broken.
Ifjustice were your guide, and peace your desire, they

would be better regarded.

Ind. The White Men are robbers. We do not
choose to be at peace with robbers ; it is more to our
honor to be at war with them.

W. Man. It is in our power to punish the aggres-
sors ; we have more warriors than the Indians; but we
choose to employ arguments rather than force.

Ind. I have heard the arguments of White Men:

they are a fair bait; but their intentions are a bearded
hook. You call us brother-s,but you treat us like beasts ;
you wish to trade with us, that you may cheat us; you
would give us peace, but you would take our lands, and
leave us nothing worth fighting for.
W. Man. The White Men want your lands; but
they are willing to pay for them. The great Parent
has iven the earth to all men in common to improve
fort eir sustenance. He delights in the numbers of
his children. If any have a superior claim, it must be
those, who, by their arts and industry, can support the
greatest number on the smallest territory.

Ind. This is the way you talk; you act differently.
You have good on your tongue, but bad in your heart.

I have been among White Men. I know as much about
«them as you do about Red Men. What .Would your

; people say, ifpoor men should go to a rich man, and tell

him, the great ‘Parent has given the earth to allmen in
common; we have. not land enough; you have more
than you need; he delights in the number of his chil-
dren ; your great farm supports but few; by our supe-
rior arts and industry, it would support many; you
may move to one corner of your land; that is sufficient
for you; we'wil1 take the rest. We will live together
as brothers, ifyou will be at peace with us; if not, we
have more warriors than you ; it is in our power to pim-
ish the aggressors; Should you call this just? N 0! no!
W. Man. i Surely not. * .

Ind. Then justice among White Men and Red

Men is different: will you show me the difference?
I thought justice was our friend as well as yours.

"  Man. -We are governed by laws that protect
our property, and punish the disturbers of peace.

I Ind. ; Then by what law do you encroach upon our
property, and disturb our peace ? If you consider us as

‘ your brothers, your laws ought to protect us as well as

yourselves.

W. Mam. Our ways of living are difl'erent from
yours. _ We have many employments and much prop-
erty: your manners are simple, your possessions small ;
our laws, of course, will not apply to your circumstances.

, Ind. Lknow you have many laws on-papemand some
that ought to make the paper blush. We have but few;
they are founded in justice, and written on the heart.
They teach us to treat a stranger as our friend ; to open
ou.r doors and spread our tables to the needy. lfa
White Man come among us, our heart is in our hand ;
all we have is his; yet you call us savages! But that

tectors, they must not expect safety. a

W. Man. We have both the same claim from each .

other; friendship and justice are all we require. Our
ideas on these subjects are different; perhaps they will
never agree. On oneside, ferocity will not be dictated
by humanity, nor stubbornness by reason; on,the other,
knowledge is not disposed to be advised by ignorance,
nor power to stoop to weakness. A

Ind. I believe we shall not make peace by our
talks. If the contention is, who has the most humanity,
let him who made us judge. We have no pretensions
to superior knowledge; we ask, Who knows best how
to use what they have ? If we contend for power, our
arms must decide : the leaves must ‘wither on the _tree
of peace; we shall cut it down with the battle-axe.
and stain the green grass that grows under it with your
blood. - i

W. .Mam. V You know the blessings of peace, and the
calamitiestof war.’ If you wish to live secure in your
wigwams, and to rovethe forest unmolested, cultivate
our friendship. Break not into our houses in the de-
fenceless hours of sleep. Let no more of our inno-
cent friends be dragged from their protectors, and driven
into the inhospitable wilderness ; or what is still more
«inhuman, fall victims to your‘ unrelenting barbarity!
If you prefer war, we shall drive its horrors into your

Ind. We love peace ;' We love our friends ; we love

over the_ big water, we treated them as brother’s : they
had nothing: peace and plentyiwere among us. \ All
the land was ours, from the east to the west water;
from thevmountains of snow in the north, to the burn-
ing path of the sun in the south. They were made
,welcome to our land and to all we possessed. To talk
like White Men, they were beggars, and We their ben-
; efactors : they were tenants at will, and We their land-
lords. But We nourished a viper. in our lbosoms. You
, have poisoned us byuyour luxury; spread contention
among us by your subtlety, and death by your tre'ach-
ery. The Indians have but two predominant passions,
friendship and revenge. Deal with us as friends, and
you may ﬁsh in our rivers or hunt in our forests. Treat
us not like servants; we shall never own you as mas-
ters. If you provoke us, our vengeance shall pursue
you. We shall drink your blood; you may spill ours.
We had rather die in honorable war, than live in dis-
V honorable peace. ‘

EXTRACT FROM AN ORATION, PRONOUNCED AT Bos-
' ‘TON, JULY 4, 1796. is

THAT‘ the best way for a great empire to tax her
colonies is to confer beneﬁts upon them, and,
' that no rulers have a right to levy contributions upon
the property, or exact the services of their subjects,
without their own, or the consent of their immediate
representatives,’ were principles "never recognized by
the ministry and parliament of Great-Britain. Fatally
enamoured of their selfish systems of policy, and obsti-
, nately determined to eﬁbct the execution of their ne-
farious purposes, they were deaf to the suggestions of

reason and the demands of justice. The frantic, though '

transient energy of intoxicated rave was exhibited in
their very act, and blackened and distorted the features
of their national character. '

On the contrary, Americans had but one object in
view, for in Independence are concentrated and con-
densed every blessing that makes life desirable, everv
right and every privilege which can tend to the hap-
piness or secure the native dignit of man. In the at-
tainment of Independence, were all their passions, their
desires, and their powers engaged. The intrepidity
and magnanimity of their armies; the wisdom and in-
ﬂexible firmness of their Congress; the ardency of their
patriotism; their unrepining patience, when assailed

y dangers and perplexed with aggravated misfortunes,
have long and deservedly employed the pen of pane-
gyric and the ton e of eulogy.

Through the ,w ole revolutionary conﬂict, a consist-
ency and systematic regularity were preserved, equally
honorable as extraordinary. The unity of design and
classical correct arrangement of the series of incidents,
which completed the Epic story of American independ-
ence, were so wonderful, so well wrought, that po itical
Hypercriticism was abashed at the mighty reduction,
and forced to join her sister Envy, in app auding the
glorious com sition.

It is ‘my p easin duty, my fellow-citizens, to felici-
tate you on the esta lishment of our national sovereign-
ty ; and among the various subjects for congratulation
and rejoicing, this is not the most unimportant, that
Heaven has spared so many veterans in the art of war ;
so many sages, who are versed in the best politics of
peace ; men,who were able to instruct and to govern, and
whose faithful services, whose unremitted exertions to
promote theipublic prosperity, entitle them to our firm-
est confidence and warmest gratitude. Uniting in the
celebration of this anniversary, I am happy to behold
many of the illustrious remnant of that band of patriots,
who, despisin g danger and death,deterrnined to be free,
or gloriously perish in the cause. Their countenances

their presence; our raptures are heightened by their
participation. The feelings, which inspired them in
the “ times which tried men’s souls,” are communicated
to our bosoms. We catch the divine spirit which im-
pelled them to bid deﬁance to the congregated host of

‘despots. We swear to preserve the blessings they toiled

to gain, which they obtained by the incessant labours of
eight distressful years; to transmit to our posterity,

~ our rights undiminished, our honor untarnished, and

our freedom unimpaired. -

On the last page of Fate’s eventful volume, with the
raptured ken of prophec.y,I behold Columbia’s name re-
corded ; her future honors and happiness inscribed. In
the same important book the approaching end of Ty-
ranny and the triumph of Right and Justice are written
in indelible characters. The struggle will soon be over;
the tottering thrones of despots will quickly fall, and

p bury their proud incumbents in their massy ruins !

Then peace on earth shall hold her easy sway,

And man forget his brother man to slay.

To martial arts, shall milder arts succeed;

Who blesses most, shall gain th’ immortal meed.
The eyeof pity shall be pain’d no more,

With Vict’ry’s crimson banners stain’d with gore.
Thou glorious era, come 3 Hail, blessed time!
When full-orb’d Freedom shall unclouded shine ;

In olive groves shall tune their sweetest lays ;
When bounteous Ceres shall direct her car,
O’er ﬁelds now blasted with the ﬁres of war;

DIALOGUE BETWEEN IEDVVARD AND HARRY.

[EDWARD alone, rearl£ng.]
Enter HARRY, with an important air.

OW are on, Ned?
Harry’ Edward: What, is it you, brother
Harry? Were it not for the small part of your face,
that appears between your fore-top and your cravat, I
should never know you.

Har. My appearance is a little altered, to be sure;
but I hope you will allow it is for the better.

Edw. I wish I could. I perceive, that, some how
or other, you are completely metamorphosed from a
plain country lad, to a Boston buck, beau, or fop:
which is the current word in your varying town dia-
lect, to express such a thing as 'ourself'?

Har. Ah, either of them wil do. The young la-
dies sometimes call me Tippy Harry; that suits my
ear the best.

Edw. That, I suppose, means a little top, or, as I
should express it, afoppee, who is obliged to stand tip-
toe to reach a lady her fan.

Har. One of your clownish blunders, Ned. It
means an airy young gentleman, dressed out in com-

plete bon ton from head to foot, like myself.

Edw. “An airy young gentleman, dressed out in
complete bon ton, &c. &c."’ This deﬁnition may be of
service to me; I will try to remember it. You always
possessed one quality of a gentleman, a large share of

ood humour: I hope you will not be angry, brother,
if I am a little inquisitive.

Har. Do, Ned, leave off using that old-fashioned
word: I had rather you would do any thin to me than
brother me at this rate. If you shou d come to
Boston, dressed as you are now, with your clumsy
shoes, coarse stockings, great small-clothes, home-spun

coat, and your old rusty go-to-mill hat, and shake
hands with me, in your awkward way; and then, to

‘complete the whole, should call me brother, I should be

thunderstruck! For my credit’s sake, I should swear

it was some crazy straggler, I had seen in the country, \

and given a few coppers to keep him from starving. I

would hide behind the counter, or lie rolled up in a ‘

piece of broadcloth a week, rather than be caughtin
such a scrape.

Edzv. An airy young gentleman, indeed! Would
swear to half a dozen lies, hidebehind the counter,

and roll yourself up in a piece of broadcloth like a silk—-
i worm, to save your credit ! You have improved much

beyond my expectations, " Tippy Harry! This sounds

better in your reﬁned ear than brother Harry, I sup-
ose. - ‘ .

pi I-Idr. Yes it does, Ned, I’ll assure you: that’s your

sort! You begin to come on a little. N ow I’ll tell you

how it is, Ned ; if you would take your old musty li-

brary here, and lay it all on the ﬁre together, and burn

all your old-fashioned clothes with it, and then ‘go to

Boston '
‘Edam What, Without any clothes, Harry?

I-Iar. Why, I think I should about as lief be seen-
With you stark naked, as with your coarse, narrow-
backed, short-waisted coat. But as I was saying be—
fore‘, then ‘put yourself under the care of a tailor, bar-
ber, shoe-maker, and a dancing master; keep a store of
English goods about three months, go to t'h.‘e.Theatre a
dozen nights, chat with our Boston Tippies, have a
few high goes, and freeze and thaw two or three
times, for you are monstrously stiff; I say, after all this,
I believe, Ned, you would make a very clever fellow.

Edzv. The freezing and thawing is a kind of
discipline I’ should not sovreadily comply with. Ihave
heard of several of your clever fellows, and ladies of
your sort, who were found frozen in old barns, and
behind board fences; but I never knew they were so
fortunate as to thaw again. Now, Harry, Iwill be

ation. Let us suppose then a person p/resenting him-
self before an assembly, in order to make a discourse
to them. It cannot be decent immediately to begin to
speak so soon as ever he makes his appearance. He
will ﬁrstsettle himself, compose his countenance, and
take arespectful View of his audience. This prepares
them for silence and attention. »

Persons commonly form some opinion of a speaker
from their ﬁrst View of him, which prejudices them
either in his favour or otherwise, as to what he says
afterwards. A grave and sedate aspect inclines them
to think him serious ; that he had considered his sub-
ject, and may have something to offer worth their at-
tention. A haughty and forbidding air occasions dis-
taste, as it looks like disrespect. «VA wandering, giddy
countenance argues levity. A dejected drooping ap-
pearance is apt to raise contempt, unless where the
subject is melancholy. And a cheerful aspect is a pro-
per prelude to a pleasant and agreeable argument.

To speak low at ﬁrst has the appearance of modesty,
and is best for the voice; which, by rising gradually,
will with more ease be carried to any pitch that may
be afterwards necessary, without straining it. . How-
ever,_some variation of the voice is always proper to
give it harmony. Nay, and sometimes it is not im-
proper for an 'orator to set outwith a considerable
degree of warmth. We have some few instances of
this in Cicero; as in his oration for Roscius Amerinus,
where the heinousness of the charge could not but ex;
cite his indignation against the accusers. And so like-
wise, in that against Piso, and the two ﬁrst against Ca-

‘tiline, which begin in the same manner, from the resent-

ment he had conceived against their persons and conduct.

-In the narration, the voice ought to be raised to some-
what a higher pitch. Matters of fact should be related
in a very plain and distinctmanner, with a proper stress
and emphasis laid upon each circumstance, accompanied
with a suitable address and motionsof the body to en-
gage the attention of the hearers. “ F or there is a certain

serious with you. Your airy young gentleman, in my
opinion, is a very insipid character ; far beneath my am-
bition. A few materials from behind the counter, the
tailor’s needle and shears, the barber’s puﬂ'and p0ma-
tum, a little sheep-skin modified by the shoe—mal<er,
and What is the most insigniﬁcant of all, a little supple,
puny machine, that in plain English, I should call a
naked fool ; to strut about the streets with all this finery;
carry it to the theatre, or dancing school; and teach
it to say a few pretty things by rote; these make
the gentlemen of your sort. Mine is composed of quite
diﬂerent materials.

Har. Pray let me know what they are: home-
spun, I dare say. I am superﬁne, you see, from head

V to foot.

Eclw. Yes, Harry, you have blundered into one
just observation. In the first place, I would lay up :1
00d store of knowledge, home-spun from my own re-
ections, reading and observation; not the second-
handed smattering of the most ignorant of all beings
who use a tongue. The tailor’s, barber’s,antl dancing-
master’s bill should not show an inventory of all I pos-
sessed. They may make my clothes, dress my hair,
and teach me how to bow ; but there must be some-
thing moreto command the bow of respect from people
of sense, the judges ofreal merit. In short, I would be
a gentleman farmer; too well informed to be influenced
by your railing newspaper polities ; too much delighted
with the bloating and playing of the flocks in my own
pasture, to read the head of Theatr-icals, or be amused
with any drove of stage-players, that have infested our
country from Charlbston to Portsmouth.‘ And I
should be much more proud of raising one likely calf,
than as many of the most insipid ofall animals, called
Tippies, as could Stand in every shop in Cernhill.

But tell me who, of all this num’rous host,

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 279

Expects his death from me? Which is the man,
Whom Israel sends to meet my bold deﬁance?
Dav. Th’ election of my sov’reign falls on me.
G-ol. On thee! on thee ! by Dagon, ’tis too much’

Thou curled minion !'thou a nation’s champion‘
‘Twould move my mirth at any other time;

But triﬂing’s out of tune. Begone, light boy!

And tempt me not too far.

Dav. I do defy thee,

Thou foul idolater! Hast thou not scorn’d

The armies of the living God I serve?

By me he will avenge upon thy head

Thy nation’s sins and thine. Arm’d with his name,
Unshrinking, I dare meet the stoutest foe

That ever bath’d his hostile spear in blood.

Gal. Indeed! ’tis wondrous well! Now, by my gods

The stripling plays the orator! Vain boy!

Keep close to that same bloodless war of words,
And thou shalt still be safe. Tongue-valiant warrior !
Where is thy sylvan crook, with garlands hung,

Of idle ﬁeld-ﬂowers? Where thy wanton harp,
Thou dainty-ﬁnger’d hero ? Better strike

Its note lascivious, or the lulling lute

Touch softly, than revoke the trumpet’s rage.

I will not stain the onor of m spear

With thy inglorious blood. S all that fair cheek
Be scarr’d with wounds unseemly? Rather 0,
And hold fond dalliance with the Syrian mai s ;

To wanton measures dance; and let them braid
The bright luxuriance of thy golden hair;

They, for their lost Adonis, may mistake

Thy dainty form. ’

Dav. Peace, thou unhallow’d railer!

0 tell it not in Gath, nor let the sound

Reach Askelon, how once your slaughter’d lords,
By mighty Samson found one common grave :

When his broad shoulder the ﬁrm pillars heav’d,
And to its base the tott’ring fabric shook.

280 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

Gal. - Insulting boy; perhaps thou hast not heard

The infamy of that inglorious day,

When your weak hosts at Eben-ezer pitch’d

Their quick,-aba—ndon’d tents. Then, when rour ark,
Your talisman, your charm, your boasted pledge

Of safety and success, was tamely lost ! ’ V ‘
And yet not tamely, since by me ’twas Won. ,
When with this good right arm, I thinn’d your ranks,
And bravely crush’d, beneath a single blow,

The chosen guardians of this vaunted shrine,

Hophni and Phineas. - The fam’d ark itself,

I bore to Ashdod.

Dav. I remember too, «

Since thou provok’st th’ unwelcome truth, how all
Your blushing priests beheld their idol’s shame ;
I/Vhen prostrate Dagon fell before the ark,

And your frail od was shiver’d. Then Philistia,
Idolatrous Philistia ﬂew for succour

To Israel’s help, and all her smitten nobles

Confess’d the Lord was God, and the blest ark,
Gladly, with reverential awe restor’d !

Gal.‘ By Ashdod’s fane thou ly’st. V Now will lmeet
thee, _ ‘

Thou insect warrior! ‘since thou dar’st me thus!
Already I behold thy mangled limbs,

Dissever’d each from each, ere long to feed

The ﬁerce, blood-snuﬁing vulture. Mark me Well !
Around my spear I’l1_twist thy shining locks,

And toss in air thy head all gash’d with wounds ;
Thy lips, yet quiv’ring with the dire convulsion ’

Of recent death! Art thou not terriﬁed’?

Dav. N 0. '
True courage is not mov’d by breath of words;

., But the rash bravery of boiling blood,

Impetuous, knows no settled principle. \

A feverish tide, it has its ebbs and ﬂows,

As spirits rise .or fall, as wine inﬂames, .

Or circumstances change. But inborn courage,
The gen’r'ous child of Fortitude and Faith,

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 28]
Holds its ﬁrm empire in the constant soul;
And, like the stedfast pole-star, never once
From the same ﬁX’d and faithful point declines.

Gal. The curses of Philistia’s gods be on thee!
This ﬁne-drawn speech is meant to lengthen out
That little life thy words pretend to scorn.

Dav. Ha! says’t thou so? Come on then! Mark

us well.

Thou com’st to me with sword, and spear, and shield!
In the dread name of Israel’s God, I come;
The living Lord of Hosts, whom thou defys’t!
Yet though no shieldl bring; no arms, except
These ﬁve smooth stones I gathered from the brook,
'With such a simple sling as shepherds use ;
Yet all ex os’d, defenceless as I am.

The God serve shall give thee up a prey

To my victorious arm. This day I mean

To make tlt’ uncircumcised tribes confess
There is a,God in Israel. I will give thee,
Spite of thy vaunted strength and giant bulk,
To glut the carrionkites. Nor thee alone ;
The mangled carcases of your thick hosts
Shall spread the plains of Elah; till Philislia,
Through her trembling tents and ii in bands,
Shall own that Judah’s God is Go in eed!

I dare thee to the trial!

Gal. Follow me.
In this good spear I trust.
l)av. Itrustin Ileaven!
The God of battles stimulates my arm,
And ﬁres my soul with ardour, not its own.

to engage the attention ofa few eyes, and a few ears, he
will esteem his reception ﬂattering. To another is al-
lotted the pleasing task of closing the evening, with re-
marks on Female Educationf‘ It is mine to recommend
the POWERS OF ELOQUENCE, and to show the
inﬂuence whichitjustly challenges, over the senses.
passions, and understandings of mankind.

Eloquence consists in a capacity of expressing, by the
voice, attitude, gesture, and countenance, the emotions
of the heart. To this art, Demosthenes and Cicero
owe their immortality; by this, the late earl of Chat-
ham gained his celebrity ; and to this, are the great pol-
iticians, now in Europe, indebtedfor their distinction.
Eloquent men begin to be heard with attention in our

Congress; pulpit orators gain crowds, and eloquent

lawyers gain causes.
_ VVhen the enlightened Statesman is discussing the
interests of a country, on which are grafted his for-
tune, fame and life, he must be eloquent. When the
general harangues a brave so1diery,at'the eve of a bat-
tle, on which depend their liberties and lives, he must
be eloquent. When the compassionate lawyer, with-
out hope of reward, advocates the cause of the suffer-
ing widow, or injured orphan, he must be eloquent.

But when true Eloquence is introduced into the sa-
cred desk, how elevated is the subject of the passion on
the cross! With what animating zeal can the preacher
call on his hearers, to “open a highway for their God!”
With what rapture can he burst from the loom of types
and figures, into the brightness oftliat everlasting Gospel
which brought “ life and immortality to light!” With
what heaven-taught joy can he hail the star in the East’
and with what semblance of reality may he lead the
imaginations of his audience to a sight of the babe in
the manger! If he feel such subjects, he must be elo-
quent and irresistible.

May we now look back and trace the progress and
inﬂuence of Eloquence on dill'eren't»subjects, and at

various periods '3 How do we feel its power, when We
hear David expressing the appearing of the Highest!
“He bowed the heavens also, and came down, and
darkness was under his feet; he rode upon a cherub,

and did ﬂy, and he was seen upon the Wings of the.

Wind.” g .

Who can hear, without emotion, the sublime elo-
quencetof the prophet Isaiah, when he announces the
future glory of the church? “ Violence shall no more
be heard in thy land; wasting nor destruction Within
thy borders: butthou shalt call thy walls Salvation,
and thy gates, Praise.” -

But in What language has the prophet Habakkuk

' described the majesty of the Creator? “ Before him

went the pestilence, and burning, coals went forth at

his feet :' he stood, and measured the earth : he beheld,

and drove asunder the nations : the everlasting moun-
tains were scattered: the perpetual hills did bow: his
ways are everlasting.” Let us pass in respectful silence
the eloquence‘ of H_im,Who“‘spake, as never man spake.”
But our attention is immediately arrested by the de-
fence of Paul before Agrippa; inwhich he describes a
light from heaven, above the brightness of the mid~day
sun; when he declares his conversion, and commission
to be‘ a minister, and a witness of those things, which
he had seen, and of those things, inwhich the Saviour

woulcl appear unto him. “Whereupon,” says he,

“ 0 king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heav-
enly vision.”

Nor can we fail to mention that eloquence, which
made—Fe1ix tremble on his throne. Nor can we read,
unmoved‘, Paul’s solemn account of the resurrection;

when, “ In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, ,

the dead shall be raised, and We shall be changed.”
But when we come to the vision on the isle of Patrnos,
where the glory of heaven was unveiled to a man of
God, we are lost in the ma’esty and sublimity of the
description of things, whic must be hereafter;_and
must close the sacred scriptures, convinced of the irre-

sistible Powers‘ of Eloquence, when employed upon di-
vine subjects.
 -Among themes less interesting, is there one, on

' which these powers have been unsuccessfully employed?

VVe read how the eloquence of one man governed all
hearts in Greece, and how astonishing was its effect

from the immortal Orator at Rome. All civilized na-

tions can furnish facts and arguments on this subject.
Wherever arts andisciences have found a residence,
oratory has been a sure attendant.

‘I am obliged to pass, with regret, the characters

[of D’Espremenil, Mirabeau, Burke, -Fox, Flood, and

Grattan, who, within our own‘ days, have -made the
Senates of three different kingdoms ring with their
eloquence. With "greater reluctance must I pa_ss the
memorable time, when all the senses, passions, and al-
most breath of ﬁve thousand people were suspended
at the admirable eloquence of Sheridan, while he de-
scribed the cruelties of Hastings on the banks of the Gan-
ges; when with unfeelin madness that despot redden-
ed the Waters with the blood of mothers and their in-
fants, and made even the river blush for the honor of
the British name. _

With pleasure I bring my sub‘ect'to the scenes of my
native country; and here coul , with the enthusiasm
of Columbus in his vision, present before you the lofty

we at length ﬁndourselves safe on the top of Nebo,
and our Moses’ yet alive at the head of our rulers.
Hence we look forward to the ﬂattering prospects of
futurity. Our orators and poets have announced bless-

- ed things in the latter days. a Our prophets have

taught us to expect the reality of golden dreams. The
leaves of our future history are gilded, and the paves
are left to be ﬁlled up, with the actions of a long list
of unambitious Cesars.

We are told, that on this our native spot of earth,
slavish government and slavish hierarchies shall cease ;
that here, the old prophecies shall be verified; that
here shall be the last, universal empire on earth, the
empire of reason and virtue ; under which the gospel
of peace shall have free course and be gloriﬁed; that
here “ the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leop—
ard with the kid, and that nation shall no more lift up
sword against nation.”

When the philosopher of the East foresaw the beauty
and excellence of this Western Continent, its immense
rivers, lakes, and mountains; cities rising from the
midst of desolation; “ men like trees walking,” where
once were the haunts of savage beasts; arts and man-
ners improvin ; the rose budding in the desert, and
the ﬂowers of t e garden in the so itary place, rich in-
deed was the prospect. But his visions have become
our realities. We live to enjoy blessingsnnore numer-
ous than Columbus could count.

We see schools, academics, and colleges, opening
their treasures to every family; and are taught, that
religion, liberty, and science, are constellations in the
heavens, which, amidst the revolution of empires, visit
in succession, all the kingdoms and people of the earth.
VVe see one half of the world involved in darkness,
and oblivious sleep; while the other is enjoying the
blessings of day, and of vigilant industry. ,

The day of American glory has at length dawned.
No more shall meteijrs of the air, and insects with gild-

ed wings, lead astray the benighted traveller, nor the .

bleaking buzzards of the night triumph over the bird of
Jove. -Prejudice, ignorance, and tyranny,.are flying
on the wings of the wind. While this day IS ours, let
us be up and doing.

286 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

May I now introduce my subject within these walls?
And here, how extensive is the theme for my feeble
powers of Eloquence ! yet may I employ them, in sug-
gesting the motives -which your sons and daughters have
to cultivate their minds. Gratitude to their parents;
your patronage; their own ambition; their prospects
of future proﬁt, usefulness, and honest fame, are among
the ﬁrst.

But highly important is rendered this morning of
life and privilege to us, from a consideration, that we
are born in the best of countries, at the best of times.
While some of the human race are suffering the ex-
treme heats of burning zones, and others are freezing
beyond the inﬂuence of benignant rays, we live in a
climate, temperate, salubrious, and healthful. While
some inherit from their parents poverty and slavery,
we are the heirs of private, public, and social beneﬁts.

Our eyes have been opened in a country, where the
Father ofmercies has been pleased to condense his bless-
ings. Oneus beams the sun of Science: ours is the
hemisphere of Freedom : here are enjoyed THE
RIGHTS OF MAN ; and upon us shine, with-ceaseless
splendour, the rays of the STAR OF BETHLEHEM.

Blest in the dlspensations of nature, providence, and
grace, on us depends a faithful improvement of our nu-
mcrous talents. Early taught the shortness and value
of life, and the importance of improving each hour of
youth, while we have leisure, and the assistance of in-
structors, we early learn to be diligent. Observing,
that with our parents, the shadows of the evening be-
gin to len then, and that soon the wheel will cease to
turn roun at the cistern ; that soon they must leave us,
and that we must fill their places, we learn to be am-
bitious and emulous to excel. But beyond these, We
have, with all other children of the universe, an argu-
ment still higher to improve these precious days. We

‘live not only for ourselves, for our parents, friends, and

country ; but for the Giver of life: we live for immor-
tality. Young as we are, and just entered the bark of

ace in telling a story, by which those who are masters -

of it seldom fail to recommend themselves in conver-
sation. ‘ . ~_
The proposition, or subject of the discourse should
be delivered with a very clear and audible voice. For
if this be not plainly heard, all that follows in proofol
it cannot be well understood. And for the same reason,
if it be divided into several ‘parts or branches, they
should each be expressed Very deliberately and dis-

tinctly. But as the design here is only information,

there can be,1itt1e room for gesture. .

 The conﬁrmation admits of great variety both of the
voice_and gesture. In reasoning, the voice is quick
and pungent, and should be enforced with suitable ac-
tions. And as descriptions likewise have often a place
here,_ in painting out the images of things, the orator
should so endeavour to adapt both hisvoice, and the
motions of his body, particularly the turn of his eyes,

and action of his hands, as may best help the imagina-,

tion of his hearers. ‘Where he introduces another per-
son speaking, or addresses an absent person, it should
be with some degreeof imitation. And in dialogue,
the voice shouldalter with the parts. When he di-
verts from his subject by any digression, his voice-
should be lively and cheerful; since that is rather de-
signed for entertainment than instruction.

In confutation, the ar uments of the adverse party
ought ﬁrst to be repeated in a plain and distinct man-
ner, that the speaker maynot seem toconceal, or avoid
the force of them. Unless they appear triﬂing and un-
worthy of a serious answer; and then a facetious man-
ner, both of expression and gestiue, may be the most
proper way to confute them. For, to attempt to an-_
swer, in a grave and serious manner, what is in itself
empty and udierous, is apt to create a suspicion of its
having more init than it really has. A

But caution should be used not to represent any ar-
gument of weight in a ludicrous way, lest bytso doing

the speakertshould more expose himself than his adver- ,

being; yelt like you, we are on a boundless ocean, and
an eterna voyage. ﬂ

As ELOQUENCE is my theme, perhaps I may be
indulged in dwelling for the few remaining moments,
on this last most interesting subject. While enjoying
the blessings of health, and the festivities of youth, we
stand on this bridge of life, careless of the rapid cur-
rents of yesterdays and to-morrows ; yet reflection
teaches that the hour is rapidly hastening, when “ the
cloud-capt towers; the gorgeous palaces; the solemn
temples ; yea, the great globe itself, with all which it
inherits, shall dissolve, and like the baseless fabric of a
vision, leave nota reck behind.” \-Ve shall survive.

Though the loss of parents and friends ; though the
frequent inﬁrmities and vicissitudes of life, teach us
gloomily to reﬂect, that “ An angel’s arm can’t snatch
us from the rave ;” yet a sure prospect of a resurrec-
tion to cease ess life,bids us say with triumph, “Legions
of angels ean’t conﬁne us there.” We look back on
the ages which have passed, and see the millions of men,
who, since the days of Adam, have been laid in the
dust. We see nine hundred and fifty millions of ra-
tional bein s, now in full life, who must, in a few years,
be cold and indeath; and in every day of our lives,
no less than eighty-six thousand of the human race,
are laid in the grave. What oceans of tears have been
shed by surviving friends !

How have mourning, lamentation, and woe been
heard not only in Rama, but throughout every quar-
ter of the inhabited earth! We contemplate» the time
when these bodies of ours, now full of life and motion,
shall be cold. We elevate our thoughts to that scene,
when the elements shall melt with fervent heat ; when
the sun shall be darkened, and the moon no more ive
light: when the stars of heaven shall fall from tieir
places, and all nature be tumbling into ruins.

Then the trump of God shall sound; then shall he,
who once said, “ Lazarus, come forth,” descend
from heaven, with a mighty shout. Then, shall the

288 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

dead hear the voice of the Son of God; then shall they
burst the bands of death, and rise, never to sleep again.
Then shall this mortal put on immortality, and death
be swallowed up of life.

We shall be present at this august resurrection ! Soon
shall we cease to see the blue canopy of the day, and
the starred curtain of the night ; to hear the rolling of
the thunder, or see the lightning of the heavens-,
scenes, which now impress us with awe and delight.
We look round creation, and see all living nature, be-
low our rank, dissolving to dust; never to revive. We
seethe ﬂowers of spring die, and the leaves of autumn
fade ; never to resume their beauty and verdure, But
contemplating the soul of man, we are led to the lan-
guage of the poet, '

“ See truth, love, and mercy in triumph descending,
‘And nature all glowing in Eden’s first bloom,
On the cold cheek of death smiles and roses are blending,
. And beauty immortal awakes from the tomb.”

This subject, itself so full of Eloquence, is also full of
instruction and argument. Whatever elevates the dig-
nity of our natures, and extends our views, teaches us
to live ; daily to improve our minds ; daily to better our
hearts. May ELOQU CNCE ever be improved in the
causetof learning and virtue; ever employed in ad-
dressing important truths to the mind, in a most forcible
and expressive manner.

May the daughters of America wear their charms,
as attendants on their virtue, the satellites of their in-
nocence, and the ornament of their sex. May her
sons early learn the principles of honor, honesty, dili-

ence, and patriotism; and when called to leave these
Eappy seats, where care is a stranger, and where learn-
ing is a free gift, be prepared for the burden and heat
of the day, and ever prove as a munition of rocks to
their country. »

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A Crrr GENTLEMAN OF-THE
ToN, AND A Courrrar Fnamsn.

ALLOO! there, Master! What
have you got in your wallet?
Farmer. Fowls, Sir, at your service. I
Gent. And what do you ask a pair?

A Farm. Fifty cents a pair for ducks, and seventy-ﬁve
cents apiece for geese and turkeys.

Gent. What is the fellow talking about? I inquired
the price of fowls ; not of geese and turkeys.

- Farm. And pray, Mister, what’ is the difference
between a fowl and a goose ? My bible teaches me,
that all the feathered tribe are rangedgunder the gen-
eral name of fowl.

Gentleman.

Gent. Why, you numskull‘! don’t quote scripture‘

to me, to prove such palpable absurdities. I can teach
you, that a,-goose, or turkey, is no more like a fowl,

‘than a human being is like one of the animal creation!

Farm. I crave your pardon, Mister. I begin to

see that I never was 1arn’d the right use of Ian uage;
for, since I come among these ﬁne gentlefolks, don’t
understand one half that’s said to me.

tered a good‘ school to learn civilization. What I
wanted, was, a pair of those creatchures that lay eggs,
Wulgarly called hens.

Farm. Why, begging your pardon, Sir, and ho-.
ping no offence,I shoul suppose, that, at least, one of
the sorts I have in my wallet lays eggs‘, from the mul-
titude of goslins I see about your streets.

Gent. Why, you fool; where were you bred? I
should imagine you come ﬁfty miles of, where they
tell me the people are almost savages; and that you
were never in market before.

Farm. It is true, I live more than ﬁfty miles oﬁ”,

begin to think I never shall desire to be again; for I
have hitherto met with pretty rough handling, I assure
you. t I

Gent. No Wonder that such ignorance should ex-
pose you to insults. A man like you, who has been
bruncr up_among savages, and not able to speak intel-
ligibly, must expect to receive severe discipline, when
he ﬁrst visits a land of civilization.

Farm. I begin to see what a sad thing it is, espe-
cially in such a place as this, to be so destitute as  am
of the right kind of larning. I confess, that, so far
from —ci'm'.lization, I havenever received but little more
than christianization. But I should think“, even that
ought to entitle an honest, well-meaning man to bet-
ter treatment than I have met with this morning.

Gent. You have no right to complain. Such a
blundering blockhead as you are ought to think him-

- self-fortchunate, if he is suffered to pass the streets with-

out having his head broke. .

Farm. Indeed, I have hardl escaped that. I have
been accosted a hundred and fty times since Ientered
the big town, by all sorts and sizes of folks, both male
and female. Which, at ﬁrst, indeed, appeared civil
enough; for not a child in the street but what mas-
ter’d me, as mannerly as though I had teach’d school
all my days. But whenever I approached them, it
was old daddy, old man, old fellow, and so on; rising
by degrees to such genteel language as your Worship

’ . seems to be master of. I ho e no olfence, Sir. . ‘The
ﬁrst time I had the honor to ‘e noticed, a ﬁne gentle-

woman called to me from her window. So I civilly
entered her door; when she squalled out, “ You ﬁlthy
brute! Have you the impudence to come in at 111
front door?” Did you not call me, madam? replied .
Yes, truly, says she ; but I thought you had more civ-
ilization, than to set your ugly, square toed shoes uplon
my carpet. I craved her ladyship’s pardon; told er
I hoped It should learn civilization from such. good ex-
ample ; ‘and got oil‘ as well as I could. ‘

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 291

Gent. It IS evident you know nothin of the world.

Farm. How should I, since I live a undred miles
oil‘, and never read scarcely any thing but my bible and
psalm book? .

Gent. Aye, sure enough. You are much to be pit-
ied. Why, according to the rules of civilizationnyou
offended the lady insufferably.

Farm. Sol perceive; though, at ﬁrst, Icould not
conceive, for the life of me, what harm there could be

in entering the front door, since there was no other

in the house; nor how my shoes could give offence, in-
asmuch as they were perfectly clean.
Gent. Why, did you not just acknowledge they
were unfashionable?
Farm. Aye, right. And mayhap she discovered
the nails in the heels; thou h I could have assured
her they would not scratch; or they were well drove,
and the heads smooth. . Well, as I was saying, soon
after I escaped from her ladyship’s civilities, I was stop-
ped by a ‘Squire-looking gentleman, whose late was
set for the same dainty that yours was, few 5. I told
“him I had as fine ones as ever were hatched. So I
shewedhim the whole contents of my wallet; when,

.allter,,;examining it critically, he exclaimed, “ You

insulting‘ puppy! I have a mind in my conscience to
‘cane you. What, sirrah! tell me you have fowls to
sell, when you have nothing but a parcel of poultry !”
So, giving me a kick or two, he tells me to go and
learn civilization.

Gent. And served you right enough too.

Farm. So as I proceeded peaceably through the
street, I met a stripling, in his soldier’s coat, making

the same use of his sword as I did of my staﬂ". Having.

a heavy load, and tripping my foot :1 little, I unfortu-
nately jostled this beard ess hero. ‘ “ What do you
mean, you dirty scoundrel!” he instantly exclaimed ;
lifting up his sword at the same time. “ Have you no
more civilization than to treat an otﬁcer of the navy in
such a rude manner?” I beg pardon, says I. It wad

purely an accident. If you were not beneath my no-
tice, says he, svvearing a big oath, which I dare not re-
peat; if you were not beneath the notice of a gentle-
man, Isay, I would soon lay you upon your beam ends,
you fresh Water lobster! You are as destitute of civiliza-
tion, as if you had never been out of sight of land in all
our life.

Gent. You will learn in time to keep at a respect-
ful distance from gentlemen of the sword. It is fort-
chunate for you, that the officer did not make daylight

. shine through you. '

Farm. believe it dangerous, Iconfess, to ven-
ture very near gentlemen, if these may be called such.
Well, the next personl met, I took, from his brogue,
to be a “ wild Irishman.” At any rate, he was a fun-
ny fellow, and discovered some marks of civilization.
Maister, says he, have you any wery good weal in

our vallet? I-do not understand Irish, Mister, replied
. Irish! Irish! old mutton-head, said he; nor. I
neither. It is enough for me that I am able to speak

good English. I ax’d« you what you had to sell. I

am ﬁtting out a wessel for Wenice; loading her with
warious keinds of prowisions, and wittualling her for a
long Woyage; and I want several undred weight of
weal, wenison, &c. with a plenty of inyons and win-
ccar, for the preserwation of ealth. I assured him I
did not comprehend his meaning. It is wery nat-
chural, replied he, to suppose it, as you are but a poor

~ countryman and want civilization. So he peaceably

withdrew. And now, good Mister, (’Squz're, per-
haps I ought to say; for, before you stopped me, I
heard you administerin oaths ;) I say good ’Squire,

as you have condescen ed to give me some useful in-'

struction, pray be so kind as to tell me, to what spe-
cies of animals a creature would belong, which should
be, in every respect, exactly like yourself, excepting
the addition of a pair of long ears? _

Gent. I will not dis race myself by keepingiyour

that unjust domination which is exercised over the Af-
ricans and their descendants, who are already in our

294 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

While the friends of humanity, in Europe and l
America, are weeping over their injured fellow-crea-
tures, and directing their ingenuity and their labors to

the removal of so disgraceful ‘a monument of cruelty

and avarice, there are not wanting men, who claim the
title, and enjoy the privileges of American citizens,
who still employ themselves in the odious traffic of hu- .»
man ﬂesh. . i ‘
Yes, in direct opposition to public sentiment, and a
law of the land, there are ships ﬁtted out, every year,

in the ports of the United States, to transport the in- ~

habitants of Africa, from their native shores, and con-
sign them to all the torments of West-India oppression.
Fellow citizens! is Justice asleep ? Is Humanity dis-
couraged and silent, on account of the many injuries
she has sustained? Were not this the case, methinks
the pursuit of the beasts of the forest would be forgot-
ten’, and such monsters of wickedness would, in their

. stead, be hunted fromlthe abodes of men.

OH AFRICA! unhappy, ill-fated region! how long
shall thy savage inhabitants have reason to utter‘com-
plaints, and ‘to imprecate the vengeance of . Heaven

‘against civilization and Christianity? Is it not enough

that nature'«’s God has consigned thee to arid plains, to
noxious vapours, to devouring beasts of prey, and to

all the scorching inﬂuences of the torrid zone? Must , '

rapineiand violence, captivity and slavery, be superad-.
(led to thy torments ; and be inﬂicted too by men, who
wear the garb of justice and -humanity; who boast the

;principles of a sublime morality; and who hypocrit-L

ically adopt the accents of the benevolent religion of
Jesus? ’ .
OH AFRICA! thou loud proclaimer of the rapacity
the treachery, and cruelty of civilized man! Thou

A FORENSIC Disrurs, ON THE QUESTION, Ann TEE
ANGLO-AMERICANS mvnowsn WiTH CAPACITY AND
‘GENIUS EQUAL TO EUROPEANS?

Yo inion is decidedl V the H‘ ti of
A_ ‘p __ yon __airma ve
M this question. In this opinion I am con-
ﬁrmed by sound argument and undeniable facts.

If nature has lavished her favours on some countries,

and dealt them out with a sparing hand in others, the
Western world is“ far from being the scene of her par-
simony. From a geographical survey of our country,
directly the reverse will appear.

This continent, extending through all the different
climates of -the earth, exhibiting on its immense sur-
faceythe largest rivers and lakes, and the loftiest moun-
tains in the known world, shews us that nature has
wrought on her largest scale on this side the Atlantic.

The soil is neither so luxuriant as to indulge in

-sloth, nor so barren, as not to aﬂbrd sufficient leisure

from its own culture, to attend to that of the mind.
These are facts, which existed before the migration of

our ancestors from Europe. The argument I shall

deduce from them, to me appears conclusive.
The soil and climate of every country is in some

rmeasurecharacteristic of the genius of its inhabitants.

Nature is uniform in her works. Where she has stint-
ed the productions of the earth, she also cramps her ani-
mal productions-, and even the mind of man. Where
she has clothed the earth with plenty, there is no de~
ﬁciency in the animate creation; and man arrives to
his full vigour.

In the application of these ph sical causes to our na-
ture, there is an effect produce on the mind, as well

as the body. The mind receives its tincture from the

objects which it contemplates. This we find confirm-
ed by the opposite sensations we feel, when viewinga
beautiful and variegated landscape, and plodding our

296 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

course over a craggy way, or _uniform, barren plain.

In these contrasted situations, it may almost be said, ,

that we possessgtwo different souls, and are not the‘
same beings. -

Those objects, which constantly surround us, must
have a more permanent effect. Where man is doomed
constantly to View the imperfect sketches and carica-
ture paintings of nature, he forms a corresponding part

of the group ; when placed amidst her most beautiful
and magniﬁcent works, we ﬁnd him elevated in thought

and complete in corporal stature. ;
These arguments may seem -far-fetched; but when

i it is admitted that Chimborazo is higher than Tene-

riife ; the Amazon and La Plata superiour «to the largest
rivers in the old world; and ‘that America abounds
with all the productions of nature in as great plenty as
any country in Europe, premises will then be estab-
lished, from which, by my reasoning, we shall‘ draw
the conclusion, that if the Aborigines of this country
are inferiour to the sava es of other parts of the world,
nature must have contra icted her own first principles.

‘ But the contrary must appear toevery unprejudiced

_, mind, both from reason and, observation. It being

granted that the savages on this continent possess ge-
nius and capacity, equal to those on the other, my ar-
gument is ended; the afﬁrmative of the question is
established ; unless those who differ from me should be
able to show, that, by some process, or rather paradox
of nature, the mental powers of ‘our forefatherstwere

degenerated by being transplanted to a soil, at leas't,“as“

congenial and fertile, as that which ave them birth.
Should it be any longer conten ed against me, I

should still appeal to facts, and rely on the philosophi-

cal discoveries and miscellaneous writings of a Franklin,

the heroic‘ valour and sagacious prudence of aW_ash-

ington, the political researches of an Adams, the nu-
merous productions in polite literature, inventions and
improvements in the useful arts; and especially that

‘spirit of enterprise, which distinguishes our nation.

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 2'7

sary. In the conclusion, both the voice and gesture
should be brisk and sprightly; which may seem to
arise from a sense of the speaker’s opinion of the good-

, ness of his cause, and that he has offered nothing but

what is agreeable to reason and truth; as likewise from
his assurancethat the audience agree with him in the
same sentiment. If an enumeration of the principal
arguments of the discourse be convenient, as it some-
times is,‘where they are pretty n“umerous,,or the dis-
course is long, they ought to be expressed in the most
clear and forcible manner. And if there be an address
to the passions, both the voice and gesture must be
suited to the nature of them.

We proceed now to the consideration of particular
expressions. And what We shall offer here, will be in
relation to the single words, sentences, and the pas-
sions. ' Even in those sentences which are expressed
in the most even and sedate manner, there is often one
7_or more words which require an emphasis and distinc-
tion of the voice. Pronouns are often of this kind; as,
this is the man. And such are many words that de-
note the circumstances and qualities of things. Such
as heighten or magnify the idea of the thing to which
they are joined, elevate the voice; as, noble, admira-
ble, majestic, greatly, and the like. On the contrary,
those which lessenthe idea, or debase it, depress the
voice, or at least protract the tone: of which sort are
the words, little, meampoorlg, contemptible, with many
others. ’ 1

Some tropes, likewise, as metaphors and verbal.ﬁg-
ures, which consist in. the repetitionof a single word,
should have a particular emphasis. As when Virgil
says of the river Araxes, “ It disdained a bridge.” And
Nisus of himself, in the same poet, “'1, Iam the man ;”
where the repeated word is loudest. This -distinction

of words, and giving them their proper emphasis, does-

not only render the expression more clear and intel-
ligible, but very much contributes to the variation 01
the voice and the preventing of a monotony.

THE COLUMBLAN ORATOR. L 297

On these I should rely to vindicate the honor of my
countr , and to combat that ‘prejudice, which would
de%ra e the capacity and genius of Americans.

I have heard your argument With patience, and '

shall answer it with candour. It is readily granted, that
there are as large rivers, extensive lakes, and loft

mountains, in America, as in any other part of the
world ; but I am totally unacquainted with the art of

measuring the capacity and genius of men, by the height
e

of the mountains they gaze upon, or the breadth of
river, whose margin they chance to inhabit.

Whether the savages of our ‘desex ts possess mental
powers equal to those of other countries, is as forei
to my purpose, as the Chimborazo, Amazon, or
Plata. I shall admit your premises, and look for the
materials of my argument on a ground you have slight-
l passed over, to confute the conclusion you have

rawn from them. '

The question is, whether the capacity and genius of
Americans is equal to that of Europeans?

Let us adopt an unexceptionable rule; “ Judge the

tree by its fruit.” If the literary productions and

works of genius of ourcountrymen are found superiour
to those of Europeans, the affirmative of the question
must be true; if inferiour, the negative, without argu-
ment, is supported by fact.

Here the balance evidently turns in my favour.
Europe can boast its masters in each of the sciences,
and its models of perfection in the polite arts. Few
Americans pursue the path of science; none have pro-
gressed, even so far as those bold and persevering
geniuses of other countries, who have removed the ob-
stacles and smoothed the way before them.

If there chance to spring up among us one whose in-
clination attaches him to the fine arts, the beggar’s'pit-
tance, instead of fame and proﬁt, becomes his portion.
He is an exotic plant, thatmust be removed to some more
congenial soil, or perish at home for want of culture. .

_ It is far from my intentions to say any thing In

298 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

derogation of those respectable characters, on whom
you rely to vindicate the literary honor of our country.
But What will be theresult of a comparison between a
few correct authors, the miscellaneous productions,
and casual discoveries, which we boast of as our own,
within a century past; and the long and brilliant cata-
logue of profound scholars, celebrated writers,_and
those exquisite specimens of taste and genius in the
fine arts, which have adorned almost every country of
Europe, Within the same eriod ? A i
This comparison wou d be disgraceful indeed to

'America. It is granted, that her sons are industrious,

brave, and enterprising; but, if prudent, they will cer-
tainly decline the contest with most European nations,
when the palm of enius is the object of dispute.

C. Different c imates undoubtedly have a different
effect on the bodies and minds of those who inhabit
them; and localcauses, in the same climate, may be
favourable, or adverse to the intellectual powers.

A pure, temperate atmosphere, and romantic scene-
ry, are productive of clear intellects and brilliant imagi-
nation. America is far from bein deﬁcient in these
advantages. The»-oratory, counci s, and sagacity of
its ‘natives, prove that their conceptions are by no
means cramped by physical causes.

This being granted, which cannot be denied, it will
be extremely diﬁicult to show a reason, why the men-
tal owers of our ancestors, or their descendants, should
su er a decay in this country, so favourable by nature
to sound judgment and brilliancy of thought.

Instead of forcing ourselves into such an absurd con-
clusion, we shall make an obvious distinction, which
will lead to a conclusion, not derogatory to the Amer-
ican character; a distinction between natural genius,
and its improvement by art. One depends on natural
causes ; the other, on the state of society.

Witha well supported claim to the former, it is no
dishonor to acknowledge ourselves inferiour to the elder

. nations of Europe in the latter. Consideringthe in-.

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR 299
{am state of our country, and the nature of our gov.
ernment, we have more reason to boast,than be asham.
ed of our progress in the ﬁne arts. ‘

If not equal in this respect, to our mother country,

iwe have made more rapid improvement than any other

nation" in the world. Our government and habits are

a republican; they cherish equal rights, and tend to an

(4

equal distribution of property. Our mode of education
has the same tendency to promote an equal distribution
of knowledge, and to make us emphatically a “ repub-
lie of letters :” Iwould not be understood adepts in the
ﬁne arts, but participants of useful knowledge.

In" the monarchical and aristocratic governments of
Europe, the case is far different. A few privileged or.
ders monopolize not only the wealth and honors, but
the knowledge of their country. They produce a few
profound scholars, who make study the business of their

ives; we acquire a portion of science, as a necessary

instrument of livelihood, and deem it_ absurd to devote,
our whole lives to the acquisition of ’ implements, with-

out having it in our power to make them useful to
ourselves or others.
. They have their thousands who are totally ignorant

of letters; we have but very few, who are not instruct-

ed in the rudiments of science. They may boast a
small number of masters in the fine arts; we are all
scholars in the useful ; and employed in improving the
works of nature, rather than imitating them.

So strong is our propensity to useful employments,
and so sure the reward of those who pursue them, that
necessity,“ the mother of invention,” has reared but
few professional poets, painters, or musicians among

us. Those, who have occasionally pursued the imitative

arts, from natural inclination, have given suﬂicient
proof, that even in them, our capacity and genius are
not inferiour to those of Europeans ; but the encourage-
ment they have met shows that the spirit of our habits
and government tends rather to general improvement in
the useful, than partial perfection in the amusing arts.

EXTRACT mom AN ORATION, DELIVERED AT Bos-
TON, MARCH 5th, 1780; BY JONATHAN MASON,
JUN. ESQ.

THE rising glory of this western hemisphere is al-

ready announced; and she is summoned to her '

seat among the nations of the earth. We have pub-
licly declared ourselves convinced of the destructive
tendency of standing armies. We have acknowledged
the necessity of public spirit and the love of virtue, to
the happiness of any people; and we profess to be sen-
sible of the great blessings that ﬂow from them. Let
us not then act unworthily of the reputable character
we now sustain. Let integrity of heart, the spirit of
freedom, and, rigid virtue be seen to actuate every
member" of the commonwealth.  _

The trial of our patriotism is yet before us ; and we
have reason to thank Heaven, that its principles are

so well known and diffused. Exercise towards each

other*the benevolent feelings of friendship; and let
that unity of sentiment, which has shone in the ﬁeld,
be equally animating in our councils. Remember that
prosperity is dangerous; that though successful, we
are not infallible. r

Let this sacred maxim receive the deepest impression
upon our minds, thatif avarice, if extortion, if ‘luxury,

and political corruption, are suffered to become popu- «

lar among us, civil discord, and the ruin of our coun-

will be the speedy consequence of such fatal vices.
But whilepatriotism is the leading principle, and our
laws are contrived with wisdom, and executed with
vigour; while industry, frugality and temperance,
are held in estimation, and we depend upon public
spirit and the love of virtue for our social happiness,

“peace and aﬂluence will throw their smiles upon the

row of individuals; our commonwealth will ﬂourish;
our land w1lll:ecome a land of liberty, and AMERICA

’ an asylum for the oppressed.

END.

28 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

In sentences, regard should be had to their length,
and the number of their parts, in order to distinguish
thefn by proper pauses. The frame and structure of
the period ought likewise to be considered, that the
voice may be so managed as to give it the most music-
al accent. Unless there be some special reason for
the contrary, it should end louder than it begins. And

' this diﬁerence of tone between the end of the former

sentence and the beginning of the next, not only helps
to distinguish the sense, but adds to the harmony of
the voice. i

In an ant’ithesis,or a sentence consisting of opposite
parts, one contrary must be louder than the other.
As, “ He is gone, but by a gainful remove, from pain-
ful labour to quiet rest ; from unquiet desire to happy
contentment; from sorrow to joy; and from transitory
time to imm07‘talil_y.” In a climax or gradation, the
voice should generally rise with it. Thus, “ There is
no enjoyment of property without government; no ov-
ernment without a magistrate; no magistrate wit out
obedience; no obedience where every one acts as he

pleases.” And so in other gradations of a different‘

form ; as, “ Since concord was lost, friendship was
lost, fidelity was lost, liberty was lost, all was lost.”
That the passions have each of them both a differ-
ent voice and action, is evident from hence, that we
know in what manner a erson is aﬂ"ected, by the tone
of his voice, though we 0 not understand the sense of
what he says, or many times so much as see him; and
we can often make the same judgment from his coun-
tenance and gestures. Love and esteem are expressed
in a smooth and cheerful tone; but anger and resent-
ment, with a rough, harsh, and interrupted voice ;
for when the spirits are ruffled, the organs are moved
unequally. Joy raises and dilates the voice, as sor-
row sinks and contracts it. Cicero takes notice of a
passage in an oration of Gracchus, wherein he bewails
the death of his brother, who was killed by Scipio,
which in his time was thought very moving: “ Unhap-

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 29

y man (says he,) whither shall I betake myself?
llVhere shall I go? Into the capitol? that ﬂows with
my brother’s blood. Shall I go home, and behold my
unhappy mother all in tears and despair?”

Though Gracchus had a very ill design in that
s peech,and his View was to excite the populace against
their governors, yet (as Cicero tells us) when he came
to this passage, he expressed himself in such moving
accents and gestures, that he extorted tears even from
his enemies. Fear occasions a tremor and hesitation
of the ‘voice, and assurance gives it strength and ﬁrm-
ness. Admiration elevates the voice, and should be ex-
pressed with pomp and magniﬁcence. “- O surprising
clemency,worthy of the highest praise andgreatest en-
comiums,and'ﬁt to be perpetuated in lasting monuments!”
This is Cicero’_s compliment to Cesar, when he thought
it for his purpose. And oftentimes this passion is ac-
companiedvvith an elevation both of the eyes and hands.
On the contrary, contempt sinks and protracts the voice.

" All exclamations should be violent. When we ad-
dress inanimate things, the voice should be higher than
when animated beings; and appeals to Heaven must
be made in a loftier tone than those to men. These
few hints for expressing the principal passions may, if
duly attended to, sufﬁce to directour practice in others.
Though, after all, it is impossible to gain a just and
decent pronunciation of voice and gesture merely from
rules, without practice and an imitation of the best
examples: which shows the wisdom of the ancients,
in training up their youth to it, by the assistance of

‘masters, to form‘both their speech and actions. But

here, as has been before observed, great caution should
be used in directin our choice of an example. An
affected imitation ogothers, in pronunciation or gesture,
especially of stage-players, whose pretensions to litera-

ture are seldom considerable, and who are generally .

too fond of ‘si'ngula7'itg/, ought to be carefully avoided.
For nothing can appear more disgusting to persons of
discernment than atfectation. '

ments the patience of this learned, polite,and respected
assembly.

Speech and reason are the characteristics_, the glory,
and the happiness of man. These are the p1ll3.I'S-Whlcll
support the fair fabric of eloquence ; the foundation,
upon which is erected the most magniﬁcent ediﬁce, that
genius could design. or art construct. To cultivate elo-
quence, then, is to improve the noblest faculties of our
nature, the richest talents with which we are entrusted.
A more convincing proof of the dignity and importance
of our subject need not, cannot be advanced. A

The benevolent design and the beneﬁcial effects of
eloquence, evince its great superiority over every other
art, which ever exercised the ingenuity of man. To
instruct, to persuade, to please; these are its objects.

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 3]

To scatter the clouds of ignorance and error from the
atmosphere of reason ; to remove the ﬁlm of prejudice
from the mental eye ; and thus to irradiate the be-
nighted mind with the cheering beams of truth,’ is at
once the-business and the glory of eloquence.

To promote the innocent and reﬁned pleasures of the
fancy and intellect; to strip the monster vice of all his
borrowed charms, and expose to view his native defor-
mity; to display the resistless attractions of virtue;
and, in one word, to rouse to action all the latent ener-
gies of man, in the proper and ardent pursuit of the
great end of his existence, is the orator-’s pleasing, be-
nevolent, sublime employment.

Nor letit be objected, that eloquence sometimes im-
pedes the course of justice, and screens the guilty from
the punishment due to their crimes. is there any
thing which is not obnoxious to abuse? Even the
benign religion of the Prince of Peace has been made
the unwilling instrument of the greatest calamities ever
experienced by man. The greater the beneﬁts which
naturally result from any thing, the more pernicious are
its effects, when diverted from’ its proper course. This
objection to eloquence isthereforc its highest eulogium.

The orator does not succeed, as some would insin-
uate, by dazzling the eye of reason with the illusive
glare of his rhetorical art, nor, by silencing her still
small voice in the thunder of his declamation; for to
her impartial tribunal he refers the truth and propriety
of whatever he asserts or proposes. After fairly con-
vincing the understanding, he may, without the impu-
tation of disingenuousness, proceed to address the fancy
and the passions. In this way he will more effectually
transfuse into his hearers his own sentiments, and make
every spring in the human machine co-operate in the
production of the desired effect. 4

The astonishing powers of eloquence are Well known,
at least to those who are conversant in ancient history.
Like a resistless torrent, it bears down every obstacle,
and turns even the current of opposing ignorance and

prejudice into the desired channel of active and zealous
compliance. It is indisputably the most potent art With-
in the compass of human acquirement. An Alexander
and a Cesar could conquer a world; but toovercome
the passions, to subdue the wills, and to commandat
pleasure the inclinations of men. can be effected only
by the all-powerful charm of enrapturing eloquence.
Though it be more than probable, that oratory was
known and cultivated in some degree in those eastern
nations, where science ﬁrst began to dawn upon the
world ; yet it ‘was not till,Greece became civilized and

, formed into distinct governments, that it made its appear-

ance in its native-,peerless majesty. Here we may ﬁx the
era of eloquence; here was its morn; here its meridian
too; for here it shone with splendor never since surpassed.

It is a common and a just remark, that eloquence
can ﬂourish only in the soil of liberty. Athens was a
republic, where the affairs of state were transacted in
the assembly of the whole people. This afforded to
eloquence a ﬁeld too fertile to remain long uncultiva-
ted by the ingenious Athenians. Orators soon made
their appearance, who did honor to language, to
Greece, to humanity:

But thoiigh the names of many have been trans-
mitted to us, whose genius and eloquence demand our
veneration and applause; yet, like stars when the sun
appears, they are lost in the superior blaze of the in-
comparable Demosthenes. His story is well known;
and his example affords the greatest encouragement to
students in eloquence ; as it proves, that,.by art,almost
in defiance of nature, a man may attain such excellence
in oratory, as shall stamp his name with the seal of im-
mortality. Demosthenes and the liberty of Greece to-
gether expired; and from this period we hear very
ittle more of Grecian eloquence.

Let us now direct our attention to that other gar-
den of eloquence, the Roman commonwealth. Here,
as in Greece, a free government ope‘ne'dthe list to such
as wished to dispute the palm in oratory. Numbers

advance, and contend manfully for the prize. But
their glory is soon to fade; for Cicero appears; Cicero,
another name for eloquence itself. It is needless to
enlarge on his character as an orator. Suﬂice it to

say, that if we ransack the histories of the world to -

ﬁnd a rival for Demosthenes, Cicero. alone can be
found capable of supporting a claim to that distin-
guished honor. , - e
Andwhen did Greece or Rome present a fairer
ﬁeld for eloquence than that which now invites the

t culture of the enlightened citizens of Columbia? We

live in a republic, the o1'ator’s natal soil; we enjoy as
much liberty, as is consistent with the nature of man;
we possess as a nation all the advantages which climate,
soil, and situation can bestow; and nothing but real
merit is here required as a qualiﬁcation for the most
digniﬁed offices of state. Never had eloquence more
ample scope.

And shall we rest satisﬁed with only admiring, or
at most with following at an awful distance, the most
illustrious orators of Greece and Rome? Shall every
other useful and ornamental art speed swiftly towards
perfection, while oratory, that most sublime of all arts;
that art, which could render one man more dreadful
to a tyrant, than hostile fleets and armies, is almost
forgotten? It must not, cannot be. That reﬁnement
of taste, that laudable ambition to excel in every thing
which does honor to humanity, which distinguishes
the Americans, and their free and popular government,
are so many springs, which, though not instantaneous
in their operation, cannot fail in time to raise Co-
lumbian eloquence “ above all Greek, above all
Roman fame.” i

‘With pleasure we descry the dawning. ef that
brightday of eloquence, which weihave anticipated.
The grand council of our nation has already evinced,
that in this respect, as in all others, our republic ac-
knowledges no existing superior. And we trust, that,

with the fondest predilection, and, inmy ﬂattering
hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of
my declining years. A retreat which was rendered
every day more necessary as well as more dear to me,
by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent

~ interruptions in my health to the gradual waste com-

mitted on it by time.

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 35

On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of
the trust, to which the voice of my country called me,
being suﬁicient to awaken in the wisest and most expe-
rienced of her citizens, a distrustful scrutiny into his
qualiﬁcations, could not but overwhelm with despon-
dence one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from
nature, and unpractised in the duties of civil adminis-
tration, ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own
deﬁciencies.

In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver is, that it
has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a
just appreciation of every circumstance by which it
might be aﬁbcted. All I dare hope is, that if, in exe-
cuting this task, I have been too much swayed by a

rateful remembrance of former instances, or by an af-
fectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the
conﬁdence of my fellow-citizens, and have thence too
little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination
for the weighty and untried cares before me, my error
will be pal iated by the motives which misled me; and
its consequences be judged by my country, with some
share of the partiality in which they originated.

Such being the impressions under which I have, in
obedience to the public summons, repaired to the pres-
ent station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in
this first oflicial act, my fervent supplications to that
Almighty Being, who rules over the universe, who
presides in the councils of nations, and whose provi-
dential aids can supply everyhuman defect, that his

benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happi-p

ness of the people of the United States, a overnment
instituted by themselves for these essentia purposes;
and may enable every instrument employed in its ad-
ministration, to execute with success, the functions al-
lotted to his charge. In tenderin this homage to the
great Author of every public am? private good, I as-
sure myself -that it expresses your sentiments not less
than my own ; nor those of my fellow-citizens at large,
less than either.

, N 0 people can be bound to acknowledge and adore
the invisible hand, which conducts the affairs of men,
more than the people of the United States. Every

step, by which they have advanced to the character of

ah independent nation, seems to have been distinguish-
ed by some token of providential agency. And in the
important’ revolution just accomplished in the system
of their united government, the tranquil deliberations
and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities,
from which the event has resulted,cannot be “com,-

ared with" the means by which most governments
have been established, without some return of pious
gratitude,’ with a humble anticipation of the future
blessings which the past seem to presage. These re-
ﬂections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced
themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed.
You will join with me, I trust, in thinking that there
are none, under the inﬂuence of which, the‘ proceed-
ings of a new and free government can more auspi-
ciously commence.

.THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 37

I shall do my utmost not to fall short of your expecta;
tions.

The senate has wisely regulated every thing neces-

sary in the expedition I am charged with; and, as I i

am ordered to set out immediately, I shall make no
delay; and I know that my colleague Caius‘Licinius,
out of hisgreat zeal for the public service, will raise
and march oil’ the troops appointed for me, with as
much ardor and expedition, as if they were for him-
self. I shall take care to transmit to you, as well as
to the senate, an exact account of all that passes; and
you may rely upon the certainty and truth of my let~
ters. But I beg of you, as a great favour, that you will
not give credit to, or lay any weight,‘ out of credulity,
upon the light reports, which are frequently spread
abroad without any author.

I perceive well, that in this war, more than in any

other, whatever resolution people may form to obviate ~

these rumours, they will not fail to make impression,
and inspire I know not what discouragement. There
are those, who in company, and even at table, com-
mand armies, make dispositions, and prescribe all the
operations of the campaign. They know better than
we, where we should encamp, and What posts it is ne-
cessary for us to sieze; at what time, and by what de-‘
ﬁle We ought to enter Macedonia; where it is proper
to have magazines; from whence, either by sea or
land, We are to bring provisions; when we are to
fight the enemy, and when lie still. v

They not only prescribe what is best to do; but
for deviating ever so little from their plans, they make
it a crime in their consul, and cite him before their
tribunal. But know, Romans, this is of very bad ef-

fect with your generals. All have not the resolution

and constancy of Fabius, to despise impertinent reports.

He could choose rather to suffer the people, upon such’

unhappy rumours, to invade. his authority, than to ruin

a.ﬂ'airs in order to preserve their opinion, and an empty

name.
,4

38 THE COLUMBIAN TORATOR.

I am far from believing, that generals stand in no
need of advice: I think, on the contrary, that Who-
ever would conduct every thing alone, upon his own
opinion, and without counsel, shows more presumption
than prudence. But some may ask, How then shall
we act reasonably? Ianswer, by not suﬁ"ering any
persons to obtrude their advice upon your generals,
. ut such as are, inrthe first place, versed’ in the art of

, War, and have learned from experience what it is to y
command ; and in the second place, who are upon the

spot; 'who.know the‘ enemy; are witnesses in person
to all. that passes; and sharers with us in all. dangers.

' If there be .any one, who conceives himself ‘capable’
of assisting me with "his counselsin the War you have
charged me with, let him not refuse to do the republic
that service; but let him go with me into Macedo-
nia. Ships, horses, tents, provisions, shall all be pro-

~r vided for himat my charge. But if he will not take

’so much trouble, and refers the tranquillity of the
city to the dangers and) fatigues of the ﬁeld, let him
not take upon him to hold the helm, and continue idle
in the port. The city of itself supplies sufﬁcvient mat-

? ter of discourse on other subjects; but as for these, let
it be silent upon them ; and know, that we shall pay no
regard to any counsels,’ but such as shall be given us in
the camp itself.‘ ‘

EXHORTATION 9N TEMPERANCE IN
,PLEASURE.

LET me particularly exhort youth to temperance
in pleasure. Let me admonish them, to beware
of that rock on which thousands, from race to race,
continue to split. ‘The love of pleasure, natural to.
man in everyperiod of his life, glows at this_age
with excessive ardor. Novelty adds fresh charms, as
yet, to every ‘gratiﬁcation ‘The world appears to

spread a continual feast; and health, vigor, and high
spirits, invite them to partake of it without restraint.
In vain we warn them of latent dangers. Religion is
accused of insufferable severity, in prohibiting enjoy-
ment: and the old, when they offer their admonitions,
are upbraided with having forgotten that they once
were young. _

And yet, my friends, to what do the restraints of
religion, and the counsels of age, with respect to

,/pleasure, amount? They may all be comprised in few

words, not to hurt yourselves, and not to hurt others,
by your pursuit of pleasure. Within these bounds,
pleasure is lawful; beyond them, it becomes criminal,
because it is ruinous. Are these restraints any other,
than what a wise man would choose to impose on
himself? We call you not to renounce pleasure, but
to enjoy it in safety. Instead of abridging it, we ex-
hort you to pursue it on an extensive plan. We pro-
pose measures for securing its possession, and for pro-
on in -its duration.

(gongsult your whole nature. Consider yourselves
not only as sensitive, but as rational beings; not only
as rational, but social; not only as social, but immortal.
Whatever violates your nature, in any of these re-
spects, cannot aﬁ-"ord true pleasure; any ‘more’ than
that which undermines an essential part of the vital
system can promote health. For the truth of this con-
clusion, we appeal, not merely to the authority of re-
ligion, nor to the testimony of the aged, but to your.-
selves and your own experience. We ask, whether
you have not found, that in a course of criminal excess,
your pleasure was more than compensated by succeed-
ing pain? Whether, if not from every particular in-
stance, yet from every habit, at least, of unlawful
gratiﬁcation, there didnot spring some thorn to wound
you; there did not arise some consequence to make
you repent of it in the issue ?

“ How long then, ye simple ones! will ye love sim-
plicity ?” How long repeat the same round of perni-

40 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

V cious folly, and tamely expose yourselves to be caught

in the same snare ? If you have any consideration, or
any ﬁrmness left, avoid temptations, for which you
have found yourselves unequal, with as much care as,_
you would shun pestilential infection. Break off all
connexions with the loose and proﬂigate. “ VVhen

‘ sinners entice t.hee, consent t.hou not. Look not on

the wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour in the
cup; for at the last, it biteth like a serpent, and sting-
eth like an adder. Remove thy way from the strange
woman, and come not near the door of her house.
Let not thine heart decline to her ways ; for her house
isthe way to hell. Thou goest after her as a bird has-
teneth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for
his life.” .

By these unhappy excesses of irregular pleasure in .

youth, how many amiable dispositions are corrupted
or destroyed ! How many rising capacities and powers
‘are suppressed! How many ﬂattering hopes of parents
and friends are totally extinguished! Who but must
drop a tear over human nature, when he beholds that
morning which arose so .bright, overcast with such’
untimely darkness ; that good humour which once capti-
vated all hearts ; that vivacity which sparkled in every
company; those abilities which were fitted for adorn-
ing the highest station, all sacriﬁced at the shrine of
low sensuality; and one, who was formed for running
the fair career of life in the midst of public esteem, cut
off by his vices at the beginning of his course, or sunk,

‘for the whole of it, into insigniﬁcancy and contempt!

These, 0 (sinful pleasure ! are thy trophies. lt is thus, ’
that, co-operating with the foe of God and man, thou
degi-adest human nature, and blastest the opening pros»-
pects of human felicity. ~

JUDAH’s PLEA FOR HIS BROTHER BENJAMIN, BEFORIEV

Josnrn IN EGYPT.

HEN we appeared before you, Sir, the, first
time, we answered without reserve, and ac-
cording to the strictest truth, all the questions which
you were pleased to put to us concerning our family.
We acquainted‘=you, that we had a father, heavily la-
den with years, but still more heavily with misfortunes;
a father,whose Whole life had been one continued strug-
gle with adversity. VVe added that we had a brother pe-
culiarly dear to him, as the children born towards the
end of their life generally are to old men, and who is
the only one remaining of his mother; his_brother‘hav-
ing comein early youth to a most tragical end‘.
4 You commanded us, as the proof of our veracity and
innocence,.to bring that brother unto you; and your

A comrnandwas delivered with such threatenings, that

the terror of them accompanied us all the way ‘back to
our country, and imbittered the remainder of our jour-
ney. We reported everything minutely to our father,
as you directed us. Resolutely and long, he refused
to intrust us withthe care of that child. Love suggested
a thousand causes of apprehension upon his account.

iHe loaded us" with the bit-terest reproaches for having

declared that we had another brother.
Subdued by the famine, he at length reluctantly con-
sented ; and putting his beloved son, this unhappy

‘youth, into our hands, conjured us by every; dear,

every awful name, to guard with tenderness his pre-
cious life; and as We would not see him expire before
our eyes in anguish and despair, to bring him back in

safety. He parted with him as with alimb torn from

his own -body; and in an agony of grief inexpressible,
deplored the dreadful necessity which separated him
from a son, on whom all the happiness of. his life de-
pended. ' i * V

. ' 4

42 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

How then can We appear before a father of such
delicate sensibility? With What eyes shall we dare
to look upon him, unless We carry back with us this
son of his right hand, this staff of his old age, whom,
alas ! you have condemned to slavery? The good old
man will expire in horrors dreadful to nature, as soon
as he shall ﬁnd that his son is not with us. Our ene-

, mies will insult over us under these misfortunes,yand

treat us as the most infamous of parricides. _
Imust appear to the world, and to myself, as the
perpetratorof that most horrid of crimes, the murder
of a father ; for it was [who most urgently pressed my
father to ield. I engaged by the most solemn pro-
mises, andy the most sacred pledges, to bring the child
back. Me he intrusted with the sacred deposit, and
of my hand he will require it. Have pity, I beseech

‘ you, on the deplorable condition of an old man, strip-.

ped of his last comfort; and whose misery will be ag-
gravated by reﬂecting that he foresaw its approach,

’ and yet wanted resolution to prevent it.

If your -just indignation must needs have a sacriﬁce,
here I am ready, at ‘the price of my‘/liberty onof my
life, to expiate this young man’s guilt, and to puréhase
his release! Grant this request, not .so much for the
sake of the youth himself, as of his absent father, who
never offended you, but who venerates your person
and esteems your virtues. ’ - _

Suffer us not to plead in vain for a shelter under your
right hand, to which We ﬂee, as to an holy altar,‘con-f
secrated as a refuge to the miserable. Pity an old man,

who, during the whole course of a long life, has culti-.

vated arts becoming a man of wisdom and probity, and
who, on account of his amiable‘ qualities, is almost

he prolesses a religion, and follows a mode of living
totally rditferent from theirs. ‘ v  i

EX'1‘R.~\.C'I‘ FROM THE PLEA or THOMAS Mum, Esq.

AT ms CELEBRATED TRIAL IN SCOTLAND.

p

GEN'rLEMEN or THE JURY,

HIS is now perhaps the last time that \I shall ad-
dress my country. I have explored the tenor of
my past life. Nothing shall tear from me the record
of my departed days. The enemies of reform have
scrutinized, in a manner hitherto unexampled in Scot-
land, every action I may have performed, every word
I may li-are uttered. Of crimes, most foul and horri-
ble, have I been accused: ofattempting to rear the
standard ofcivil war; to plunge this land in blood, and
to cover it with desolation. At every step, as the evi-
dence of the crown advanced, my innocency has bright-
ened. So far from inflaming the minds of men to se-
dition and outrage, all the witnesses have concurred,
that my only‘ anxiety was, to impress upon them the
necessity of peace, of good order, and of good morals.
What then has been my crime ? Not the lending to

a relation a copy of Mr. Paine’s Works ; not the givin
away to another a few numbers of ,an innocent and
constitutional publication; but for having dared to be,
according to the measure of my feeble abi ities, a stren-
Lions and active advocate for an equal representation of
the PEOPLE, in the HOUSE OF THE PEOPLE;

for having dared to attempt to accomplish a measure, by

legal means, which was to diminish the Weight of their ’

taxes, and to put an end to the effusion of their blood.

From my infancy to ~”this moment, I have devoted

myself to the cause of the PEOPLE. It is a good
cause. It will ultimately prevail. It will ﬁnally tri-

umph. _, Say then openly, in your verdict, ifyou do con- i

demn me, which I presume you will not, that it is for my
attachment to this cause alone, and not for those vain and
wretched pretexts stated in the indictment, intended on-
ly to colour and disguise the real motives of my accusa-

tion. The time will come, when men must stand or fall

by their actions; when all human pageantry shall cease ‘; '

when the hearts of all shall be laid open to view.

If you regard your most important interests; if you
wish that your consciences should whisper to you
words of ‘consolation, rather than speak to you in the
terrible language of remorse, weigh well the verdict
you are to pronounce. L
, As for me, I am careless and indifferent to my fate.
Ican look danger, and I can look death in‘the face;
for I am shielded by the consciousness of my own recti-

tude. Imay be condemned to languish in the recesses

of a dungeon. I may be doomed to ascend the scaf-
fold. Nothing can deprive me ‘of the recollection of
the ast; nothing can destroy my inward peace of
mind), arising from the remembrance of having dis-
charged my duty. ‘

ON THE STARRVY HEAVENS.

0 us who dwell on its surface, the earth is by
far the most extensive orb that our eyes can any
where behold. It is also clothed with verdure; dis-
tinguished by trees; and adorned with a Variety of
beautiful decorations. Whereas, to a spectator placed
on one of the planets, it yvears auniformaspect ; looks
all luminous, and no larger than a spot. To beings
who dwell at still “greater distances, it entirely dis-
appears. ,

That which we call, alternately, the morning and
evﬁhing star; as in one part of her orbit, she rides
foremost in the procession of night; in the other, ush-
ers in, and anticipates the dawn, is a planetary world;
which, withithe five others, that so wonderfully vary

for animal subsistence, and are supposed to be abodes ’

of intellectual life. All which, together with this our
earthly habitation, are dependant on that grand dis-
penser of divine muniﬁcence, the sun; receive their
light from the distribution 'of,his rays; derive their
comfort from his divine agency. “

The sun is the great axle of heaven, about which,
the globe We inhabit, and other more spacious orbs,
wheel their ‘stated courses. The sun, though seem-
ingly stnaller than the dial it illuminates, is abundant-
ly larger than this whole earth; on which so many lofty
mountains rise, and such vast oceans roll. A line, ex-
tending through the centre of that resplendent orb,
would measure more than eight hundred thousand
miles. A girdle, formed to surround it, would require
a length. of millions. Were its solid contents to be es-
timated, the account would overpower our understand-
ing, and be almost beyond the power of languageito
express. , , / 

Are we startled at these reports of astronomy? Are
we ready to cry out in a transport of surprise, How
mighty is the Being, who kindled such a prodigious
ﬁre, and who keeps alive, from age to age, such an
enormous mass of flame! Let us attend our philosophic
guides, and we shall be brought acquaintedgwith spec-

_ ulations more enlarged, and more amazing.

This sun, with all attendant planets, is but a very
little part of the grand machine of the universe. Every
star. though in a.ppCaran(:e no bigger than the dia-
mond that glitters on a lady’s ring, is really a mighty
globe; like the sun in size, and in glory; no less spa-
cious; no less luminous than the radiant source of our
day. So that every star is not barely afvvorld, but the
centre of a magniﬁcent system ; has a retinue of worlds,
irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attrac~
tive inﬂuence. All which are lost to our sight in un-
measurable wilds of ether. t - V

scarcely distinguishable points, is owing to their im-

MAN SENATE, AFTER THE CONSPIRACY or CAT!-
LINE. ‘

 HAVE ‘often spoken before you, Fathers’, with

some extent, to cpmplain of luxury and the greedi-
ness for money, the twin vices of ‘our corrupt citizens;
and have thereby drawn upon myself abundance
of enemies. As I never spared any fault in myself,
I was not easily inclined to favour the criminal ex-
cesses of others.

But though you paid little regard to my remon-
strances, the Commonwealth has still subsisted by its
own strength; has borne itself up, ‘notwithstanding
your neglect. It is not now the same. ' ‘Our manners,
good or bad, are not the question, nor to preservethe
t ’ atness and lustre of the Roman empire; but to
, olve whether all we possess and govern, well or ill,
shall continue our’s, or be transferred with ourselves
to enemies. ‘

I At such a time, in such a state, some talk to us of
lenity and compassion. It is long that we have lost
the right names of things. The Commonwealth isin

treasury : but let them not make a Iargess of our blood ;
and, to spare a small number ofvile wretches, expose all
good men to destruction.

Do not imagine, Fathers, thatvit was by arms our
-ancestors rendered this Commonwealth so great, from
so small a beginning. If it had been so, we should
now see it much more flourishing, as we have more al-
lies and citizens, more horse and foot, than they had.
But they had other things’, that made them great, of
which no traces remain amongst us :_atmhome, labor
and industry; abroad, just. and equitable government;
a constancy of soul, and an innocence of gianners,
that kept them perfectly free in their councils ;- unre-
strained either by the remembranc'e of past crimes, or
by craving appetites to satisfy.

For these virtues, we have luxury and avarice; or
madness to squander, joined with no less, to gain;
the State is poor, and private men are rich.‘ We, ad-
mire nothing but riches ; We give ourselves up to sloth
and effeminacy; we make no distinction between the
good and the bad ; whilst ambition engrosses all the re-
wards of virtue. Do you wonder, then, that‘danger-
ous conspiracies should be formed ? Whilst you regard
nothing but your private interest ; whilst voluptuous-
ness solely employs you at home, and avidity or favor
governs you here, the Commonwealth, Without defence,
is ex osed to the devices of any‘ one who thinks ﬁt to

DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GHOSTS or AN Enemsa
DUELLIST, A NORTH-AMERICAN SAVAGE, AND MER-
CURY.

1

D H. t ERCURY, Charon’s boat is on the

WI ls ' other slde of ‘the water. _ Allow
me, before it returns, to have some conversation
with the North-American Savage; whom you brought
hither with me. I never before saw one pf that spe-
cies. He looks very grim. Pray, Sir, what is your
name? I understand you speak English.

Savage. Yes, I learned it in my childhood, having
been bred for some years among the English of N ew-
York. But,.before I was a man, I returned to my val-
iant countrymen, the Mohawks ; and having been vil-
lanously cheated by one of your’s in the sale of some
rum, I never cared to have any thing to do with them
afterwards; Yet I took up the hatchet for them with
the rest of mytribe in the late war against France, and
was killed while I was out upon a scalping party. But
I died very well satisﬁed: for my brethren were vic-
torious; and, before I was shot, I had gloriously scalp-
ed seven men, and five women and children. In a
former war, I had performed still greater exploits. My
name is the Bloody Bear: it was given me to express
my ﬁerceness and valour.

Duel. Bloody Bear, I respect you, and am much
your humble servant. My name is Tom Pushwell,

 well known at Arthur’s. I am a gentleman by my

    

D‘

, and by profession a gamester and a man of hon-
or. I have killed men in fair ﬁghting, in honorable
single combat ; but don’t understand cutting the
throats of women and children.

Sav. Sir, that is our way of making war. Every na-
tion has its customs. But by the rimness of your coun-
tenance. and that hole in your reast, I presume you

were killed as I Was,in somescalpiug party. ‘How hap-
pened it that your enemy did not take off your scalp ?

Duel. Sir, I was killed in a duel. A friend of mine
had lent me a. sum of money ; and after two or three
years, being in great want himself, he asked me to
pay him. I thought his demand, which was somewhat
peremptory, an affront to my honor, and sent "him a

challenge. We met in Hyde Park. The fellow could‘

not fence : but I was absolutely the adroitest swords-
man in England. So I gave him three or four wounds ;
but at last he ran upon me with such impctuosity, that
he put me out of my play, and I could not prevent him
from whipping me through the lungs. I died the next
day, -as a man of honor should ; without any snivellin
signs of contrition or repentance : and he will follow
me soon; for his surgeon has -declared his wounds to
be mortal. It is said that his wife is dead of grief, and
that his family of seven children will be undone by his
death. So I am’ well revenged, and that is a comfort.
For my part, I had no wife. I always hated marriage :
my mistress will take good care of herself, and my chil-
dren are provided for at the foundling hospital.

Sav. Mercury, I won’t go in the boat with that
fellow. He has murdered his countryman ; he has
murdered his friend: I say positively, I won’t go in

. the boat with that fellow.’ I will swim over the river:

I can swim like a duck.

.Mer. Swim over the Styx! it must not be done:
it is against the laws of Pluto’s empire. You must go
in the boat and be quiet. ‘

Sav. Don’t tell me of laws : I am a savage: I value
no laws. Talk of laws to the Englishman: there
are laws in his country; and yet you see he did not
regard them. For they could never allow him to kill
hisfellow-subject, in time of peace, because he ask-

ed him to pay an honest debt. I know, indeed, that

the English are a barbarous nation: but they can’t
possibly be so brutal as to make such things lawful.

52 I THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR‘.

Mer. You reason well against him. But how comes
it that you are ‘so offended with murder; you, who
have frequently massacred women in their sleep, and
children in the cradle? ’

« Sav. I killed none but my enemies: I never killed
my own countrymen : I never killed my friend.
Here, take my blanket, and let it come over in the
boat; but see that the murderer does notsit upon it,
or touch it. If he does, «I will burn it ‘instantly in the
fire I see yonder. Farewell. Iam determined to swim
over the water. I

Mer. By this touch of my wand, I_~deprive thee of
all thy strength. Swim now’ if thou canst.

Sav. This is a potent enchanter. ' Restore me my
strength, andl promise to obey thee. .

Mer. I restore it; but be orderly, and do as I bid
you ; otherwise worse will befal you. '

Duel. Mercury, leave him to me. I’ll tutor. him
for you. Sirrah Savage, dost thou pretend to be asha-
med of my company? Dost thou not know that I have
kept the best company in England?

~Sav. I know thou art a scoundrel. Not pay thy
debts ! kill thy friend who lent thee money for asking
thee for it! Get out of my sight. I will drive thee
into the Styx.

.Mer. Stop. I command thee. No violence. Talk
to him calmly. I’ ' r '

Sav. I must obey thee. Well, Sir, let me know
what merit you had to introduce you into good com.-
pany? What could you do ? I‘

V Duel. Sir, I gamed, as I told you. Besides, I kept
atiyiygood table. I eat as well as any man either in En-
gland or France. S .

Srw. Eat! did you ever eat the liver of a French-
man, or his leg, or his shoulder.’ There is fine eating
for ou! I have eat twenty. My table was always
wel‘ served. My wife was esteemed the best cookfor
the dressing of man’s ﬂesh in all N orth-America. You
will not pretend to compare your eating with mine ?

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.’ 53

Duel. I danced very ﬁnely. . . '

Sav. I’ll dance with thee for thy ears. I can dance
all day long. Ican dance the war dance with more
spirit than any man of my nation. Let us see thee
begin it. How thou standest like a post! Has Mercury
struck thee with his enfeeblin rod? Or art thou asha-
med to let us see how awiwardv thou art? If he
wouldpermit me, I would teach theeto dance in'a
way that thou hast never yet learned. ‘But what else

’ canst thou do, thou bragging rascal ?

Duel. O misery! must I bear all this! VVhat can
I do with this fellow? 1 have neither sword nor pis-
tol ; and his shade seems to be twice as strong as mine.

.Mer. You must answer his questions. It was your
own desire to have a conversation with him. He is
not well bred ; but he willtell you some truths which
you must necessarily hear, when you come before Rha-
damanthus. ~ He asked you What you could do beside
eating and dancing. . ~ .

Duel. _I sung very agreeably.

Sow. Let me hear yousing your death song, or the
War whoop. I challenge you to sing. Come, begin.
The fellow is mute. Mercury, this is a liar. He
has told us nothing but lies. Let me pull out his
tongue. ’ . ~

Duel. The lie given me! and alas! Idare not re-
sent it ! What an indelible disgrace to the family of the
Pushwells! This is indeed tormenting.

Mar. Here, Charon, take these two savages to your
care. How far the barbarism of the Mohawk will ex-
cuse his horrid acts, I leave Minos to judge. But what
can be said for the Englishman? Can we plead the
custom of Duellin 7 A bad excuse at the best! but
here it cannot avaﬁ. The spirit that urged him to draw
his sword against his friend is not that of honor; it is
the spirit of the furies ; and to them he must go.

Sav. If he is to be punished for his wickedness; turn -

him over to me. I perfectly understand the art of tor-
menting. Sirrah, I begin my work with this box on

SPEECH 01' AN ‘INDIAN CHIEF, or THE STOCKBRIDGE
TRIBE, TO THE MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESS, IN THE
YEAR 1775.

BROTHERS’!

Y OU remember, when you first came over the
great waters-, I was great and you were little;

‘very small. I then took you in for a friend, and kept

you under my arms, so that no one might injure you.

Since that time We have ever been true friends: there

has never been any quarrel between us. But now our
conditions are changed. You are become great and

_tall. You reach to the clouds. You are seen all

round the world. I am -become small; very little.
lam not so high as your knee. Now you take care of
me; and I look to you for protection. -
Brothers! 1 amsorry to hear of this great quar-
rel between you and Old England. It appears that
blood must soon be shed to end this quarrel. We never
till this day understood the foundation of this quarrel
between you and the country you came from. _ Broth-
ers! Whenever I see your blood running, you will
soon ﬁnd me about you to revenge my brothers’ blood.
Although I am low and very‘ small, I will gripe hold of

your ,enemy’s heel, that he cannot ‘run so fast, and so

light. as ifhe had nothing at his heels. ,
Brothers! You know lam not so wise as you are,
therefore 1 ask your advice in what I am now going to
say. 1 have been thinking, before you come to action,
to take a run to the westward, and feel the mind of
my Indian brethren, the Six Nations, and knowhow
they stand; whether they are on your side,“or for

your enemies. _ If  ﬁnd they.are against you, I will
try to turn their minds. I think they Wlll listen to
me ; for they have always looked this way for advice,
concerning all important news that,comes from the

rising sun. If they hearken to me, you,Will not be ‘_

afraid ofany danger from behind you, " However their
minds are affected, you shall soon know by me. Now
I think I_ can do you more service in this way than by
marchingolf immediately to Boston, and staying there.
It may be agreat while before blood runs. Now, as
I said, you are wiser than I, I leave this for your con-
sideration, whether I come down immediately, or wait
till I hear some blood -is spilled.

Brothers! I would not have you think by this, that
we are falling back from our engagements. We are
ready to do any thing for your relief, and shall be gui-
ded by your counsel. - ,

Brothers! one thing I ask of you, ‘if you send for
me to ﬁ ht, that you will let me fight in my own Indian
way. %am not used to ﬁght English fashion; there-
fore you must not expect I can train like your men.
Only point out to me where your -enemies keep, and
that is all I shall want to know.

ON Til-IE CREATION OF THE WORLD.

TO the ancient philosophers, creation from nothing
appeared an unintelligible idea. They main-_
tained the eternal existence of matter, which they
supposed to be modelled by the sovereign mind of -the
universe, into the form which theearth now exhibits.
But there is nothing in this opinion which gives it any
title to be opposed to the authority ofrevelation. The
doctrine of two self-existent, independent principles,

God and matter, the one active, the other passiye, is a .

hypothesis which presents difficulties to human reason,
at least as great as the creation of matter from nothing.
Adhering then to the testimony ofscripture, we, believe,

56 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

that “ in the beginning, God created,” or from non-ex:
istence brought into being, “ the heavens and the earth.”
But though there was a period when this globe,
with all that we see upon it, did not exist,'we have no
reason to think, that the wisdom and power of the
Almighty were then without exercise or employment
Boundless is the extent of his dominion. Other globes
and worlds, enlightened by other suns, may then have
occupied, they still appear to occupy, the immense
_regions of space. Numberless orders of beings, to us
unknown, people the wide extent of the universe, and
aﬁbrdan endless variety of objects to the ruling care
of the great Father of all. At length, in the cours.e
and progress of his government, there arrived a period,

‘When this earth was to be called into existence. When

the signal moment predestinated from all eternity, was

come, the Deity arose in his might, and with a word

created the world. , i v
What an illustrious moment was that, when, from

-non-existence, there sprang at once ‘into being this

mighty globe, on which so many millions of creatures
now dwell! N o preparatory measures were required.
No long circuit of means was employed. ~ “ He spake;
and it‘ was done: He commanded, and ‘it stood fast.”
The earth was, at ﬁrst, “ without form, and void ; and
darkness was upon the face of the deep.” The Almighty
surveyed the dark abyss; and ﬁxed bounds to the sev-
eral divisions of nature. He said, “ Let there be light,
and there was light.” ‘

Then appeared the sea, and the dry land. The
mountains rose; and the rivers ﬂowed. The sun and
moon began their course in the skies. Herbs and plants
clothed the ground. The air, the earth, and the wa-

iters were stored with their respective inhabitants. At

last, man was made after. the image of God. v He ap-

' peered, walking with countenance erect; and received

is Creator’s benediction, as the lord of this new
World. The Almighty beheld his work when it was
ﬁnished, and pronounced" it good. Superior beings saw

with wonder this new accession to existence. “ The
morning stars sang together ; and all the sons of God
shouted for joy.” . s

But, on this great.work of creation, let us not mere-
ly gaze with astonishment. Let us consider how it
should affect our conduct, by presenting the divine per-
fections in a light which is at once edifying and com-
forting to man. It displays the Creator as supreme in
power, in wisdom, and in goodness. Let us look around,
and survey this stupendous ediﬁce, which we have been
admitted to inhabit. Let us think of the extent of the
different climates and regions of the earth; of the mag-
nitude of the mountains, and of the expanse of the
ocean. Let us conceive that immense globe which con-
tains them, launched at once from the hand of the Al-
mighty; made to revolve incessantly on its axis, that it
might produce the vicissitudes of day and night; thrown
forth, at the same time, to run its annual course in per-
petual circuit through the heavens. «

After such a meditation, where is the greatness,
Where is the pride of man? Into what total annihila-
tion do we sink, before anomiiipoteiit Being! Revere
ence, and humble adoration ought spontaneously to
arise. He, who feels no propensity to worship and
adore, is dead to all sense of grandeur and. majesty;
has extinguished one of the most natural feelings of t e
human heart.

IT is a long time, Mr. Speaker, since I have attended
in Parliament. When the resolution was taken in
the House to tax America,  Was ill in bed. If I
could have endured to have been carried in my bed,
so great was the agitation of my mind for the conse-
quences, that I would have solicited some kind hand to
have laid me down on this ﬂoor, to have borne my tes

gentlemen will come to this debate with all the temper
and impartiality that his Majesty recommends, and the
importance of the subject requires. A subject of great-
er importance than ever engaged the attention of this
House! That subject only excepted, When, nearly a
century ago, it was the question whether you yourselves
were to be bond or free. In the mean time, as I can-
not depend upon health“ for any future day, such is the
nature of my inﬁrmities, I will beg to say a few Words
at present, leaving the justice, the equity, the policy,
the expediency of the act to another time.

I will only speak to one point, which seems not to
have been generally understood. Some gentlemen
seem to have considered it as a point of honor. If gen-

tlemen consider it in that light, they leave all measures ii

of right and wrong, to follow a delusion that may lead

to destruction. It is my opinion that this kingdom has

no right to lay a tax upon the Colonies. VV hen in this
House we give andgrant, ‘we giveand grant what is
our own. But in an American tax, what do we do?
We, your Majesty’s Commons of Great-Britain, give,

and grant to your Majesty, what? our own p1'opertyi.§

No. We giveand rant to your Majesty, the property
of your Majesty’s Commons of America. It is an ab-
surdity in terms. ' A
There is an idea in some, that the Colonies are vu
tually represented in this House. I would fain know
by whom an American is represented here ? Is he rep-
resented by any knight of the shire, in any county in
this kingdom ? Or will you tell him that he is repre-
sented by any representative of a borough; a borou h,

which perhaps no man ever saw? This is what is cal ed,
the rotten part -of the Constitution. It cannot con- '

tinue a century. If it does not drop, it-must be ampu-
tated. ‘ The idea of a virtual representation of America,
in this House, is the most contemptible idea that ever
entered into the head of a man.’ It does not deserve a.
serious refutation. . ' A ‘

so THE coLUMB1AN ORATOR.

The Commons of America, I‘€pI‘CS€ntCC1 In their sev-
eral assemblies, have ever been in possession of the
exercise of this, their constitutional right of giving and
granting their own money. They would have been
slaves if they had not enjoyed it. V

A great deal has been said without doors, of the
power, of the strength of America. It is a topic which
ought to be cautiously mecldled with. In a good cause,
on a sound bottom, the force of this country can crush
America to atoms. I know the valour of your troops.
I know the skill of your officers. There is not a com-
pany of foot that has served in America, out of which
you may not pick a man of sufficient knowledge and
experience, to make a governor of a colony there. But
on this ground, on the Stamp¥Act, when so many here
will think it a crying injustice, I am one who will lift
up my hands against it.

In such a cause, your success would be hazardous.
America, if she fell, would fall like the strong man.
She would embrace the pillars of the State, and pull
down the constitution along with her. Is this your

‘Tlboasted peace? Not to sheath the sword in its scab-

bard, but to sheath it in the bowels of your country-
men’! Will you quarrel with yourselves, now the whole
house of Bourbon is united against you ? »

The Americans have, been wronged. They have
been driven to madness by injustice. Will you punish
them‘ for the madness you have occasioned? Rather
let prudence and temper come first from this side. I
will undertake for America, that she will follow the
example.

Upon the whole, I will beg leave to tell the House
what is really my 0 inion. It is, that the Stamp-Act
be repealed absolute y, totally, and immediately.

you an’t all conjurers in this world, are you?

Es. Your behaviour to him is suﬂicient proof of
his condition, without the gift of conjura-tion.

.Mrs. Tat. Why, I was as free with him before mar-
riage as I am now; I never was coy or prudish in my
life. a .
Es. “I believe you, madam; pray, how long have
you been married? you seem to be very young,
madam. , J o

Mrs. Tat. I am old enough for a husband, and
have been married long enough to be tired of one.

Es. How long, pray?

Mrs. Tat. Why, above three months: ‘I’ married.

Mr. Tatoo without my guardian’s consent. V

-./Es. If you married him with your own consent, I
think you might continue your affection a little longer.

Mrs. Tat. What signiﬁes what you think, if*I don’t
think so? We are quite tired of one another, and are
come to drink some of your le—lethaly——le-lethily, I
think they call it, to forget one another, andCbe‘unmar-
ried again. . .

you may easily forget him Without the assistance of e

, ung and so foolishlas that comes to, to be directed
hi; my husband, or to care what either he says, or you
$3. .
Iilllr. Tat. Sir, I was a arummer in a marching regi-
ment, when I ran away with that young lady. I im-
mediately bought out of the corps, and thought myself
made forever; little imagining that a poor vain fellow
was purchasing fortune at the expense of his happiness.

Es. ’Tis even so, friend ; fortune and felicity are as
often at variance as man and wife. ‘

Mr. Tat. I found it so, Sir. This high life (asl
thought it) did not agree with me ; lhave not laugh’d,
and scarcely slept, since my advancement; and unless
your worship can alter her notions,l must e’en quit the

blessings of a ﬁne lady and her portion, and, for con-“

tent, have recourse to eight pence a-day and my drum
again. .
Es. Pray, who has advised you to a separation ?
Mrs. Tat. Several young ladies of my acquaintance;
who tell me, they are not angry at me for-marrying

him; but for being fond of him since I have marrie

him ; and they say I should be as complete a ﬁne lady
as any of them, if I would but procure a separate di-
vorcement. »

Es. Pray, madam, will you let me know what you
call a ﬁne lady ? ‘

Mrs. Tat. Why, a ﬁne lady, and a ﬁne gentleman,
are two of the ﬁnest things upon earth. ‘

Es. l have just now had the honour of knowing what
a line gentleman is; so, pray conﬁne yourself to the

lad .

rs. Tat. A fine lady, before marriage, lives with.

her papa and mamma, who breed her up till she learns
to despise them, and resolves to do nothing they bid
her; this makes her such a prodigious favorite, that
she wants for nothing. And when once? she is her own
mistress, then comes the pleasure! I I

Mrs. Tat. Shep lies in bed all the morning, rattles
about all day, and sits up all night ;‘_she goes every

where, and sees every thing ; knows every body, and /

loves no body ; ridicules her friends, coquetskvitli her
lovers, sets them together by the ears, tells ﬁbs, makes
mischief, buys china, cheats at cards, keeps a lap-dog.
and hates the parson ; she laughs much, talks lou ,
never blushes, says what she will, does what she will,
goes where she will, marries whom she pleases, hates
her husband in a month, breaks his heart in four, be-
comes a widow, slips from her gallants, and begins the
world again. There’s a life for you; what do you
think of a ﬁne lady now?

Es. As I expected. You are very young, madam,
and, if you are not very careful, your natural propensity
tonoise and aﬁectation will run you headlong into
folly, extravagance, and repentance.

Mrs. Tat. What would you have me do?

Es. Drink a large quantity of lethe to the loss of
your acquaintance; and do you, Sir, drink another,
to forget this false step of your wife; for whilst you
remember her folly, you can never thoroughly regard
her; and whilst you keep good company, madam, as
you call it, and follow their example, you can never

have a just regard for your husband; so both drink

and be happy.

Mrs. Tat. Well, give it me whilstl am in humour, or
I shall certainly chan e my mind again.

f.Es. Be patient til the rest of the company drink,
and divert yourself in the mean time with walking in
the grove. ’ ,

Mrs. Tat. Well, come along, husband and keep
me in humour, or I shall beat you such an alarum as
you never beat in all vour life.

EXTRACT FROM“ THE EULOGY ON D11. FRANKLIN,
V PRONOUNCEDV BY THE ABBE FAUCHET, IN THE NAME
~01‘ rrnn COMMONS or PARIS, 1790.

A SECOND creation has taken place; the ele-
ments of society begin to combine together;
the moral universe is now seen issuing from chaos;
the genius of libert is awakened, an springs up;
she sheds her divine ight and creative powers "upon the
two hemispheres. A great nation, astonished at seeing
herself ’free, stretches her arms from one extremitygof
the earth to the other, and _’embraces the ﬁrst nation
that became so: the foundations of a-new city are cre-
ated in the two worlds ; brother nations hasten to in-
habit it. t It is the city of mankind! . .

One of the ﬁrst founders of this universal city was the
immortal FRANKLIN, the deliverer of America;
The second founders, who accelerated this great work,
made it worthy of Europe. The legislators of France
have rendered the most solemn homage to his memory.

It has commanded this funeral solemnity, in order to
perpetuate the gratitude and the grief of this third
country, which, by the courage and activity with which
it has proﬁted of his lessons, has shown itself worthy of
having him at once for an instructor and a model.

In selecting me for the interpreter of its wishes, it
has declared, that it is less to the talents of an orator,
than to the patriotism of a citizen, the zeal of a preacher
of liberty, and the sensibility of a friend of men, that
it hath conﬁded this solemn function. In this point of
view, I may speak with firm conﬁdence; for I have the
public opinion, and the testimony of In own con-
science, to second my wishes. Since nothing else is
wanting than freedom, and sensibility, for that species

of eloquence which this eulogium requires, I am satis-.

ﬁed; fqrl already possess them. -. ~

Theacademies, the philosophical societies, the learn-
ed associations which have done themselves honor by in-
scribing the name of Franklin in their records, can best
appreciate the debt due to his genius, for having ex-
tended the power of man over nature, and presented
new and sublime ideas, in a style simple as tI'1l,i.lf?l;§;’ and
pure as light. ‘ 3
' Itis «not the naturalist and the philosopher, that the

Franklin, in his periodical works, which had prodi-
gious circulation on the continent of America, laid the

sacred foundations of social morality. He was no -less.

when applied to the duties of friendship, general chari-r

ty, the employment of one’s time, the happiness at-
tendant upon good works, the necessary combination
of private with public welfare, the propriety and ne-
cessity of industry; and to that happy state whlch puts
us at ease with society and with ourselves. The prov-
erbs of “ Old Henry,” and “ Poor Richard,” are In

the hands both of the learned and the ignorant; they ‘

contain the most sublime morality, reduced to popular
language and common comprehension; and form the
catechism of happiness for all mankind.

Franklin was too great a moralist, and too well
acquainted with human affairs, not to perceive that
women were the arbiters of manners. He strove to
perfect their empire; and accordingly engaged thetn
to adorn the sceptre of virtue. with their graces. It is
in their power to excite courage; to overthrow vice,
bymcans oftheir disdain ; to kindle civism, and to light
up in every heart the holy love of our country.

His daughter, who was opulent and honored with
the public esteem, helped to manufacture and to make
up the clothing for the army with her own hands;
and spread abroad a noble emulation among the female
citizens, who became eager to assist those by means of
the needle and the spindle‘, M10 were serving the state
with their swords and their guns. ‘

With the charm ever attendant upon true wisdom.

and the grace ever ﬂowingfrom true sentiment, this
grave philosopher knew how to converse with the other
sex ; to inspire them with a taste for domestic occupa-
tions; to hold out to them the prize attendant upon
honor unaccompanied by reproach, and instil the duty
of cultivating the first precepts of education, in order
to teach them to their children; and thus to acquit
the debt due to nature, and fulﬁl the hope of song-
ty. It must be acknowledged, that, in his own cqg_n-
trv. he addressed himself to minds capable of compre-
hending him. ’ .

THE‘ COLUMBIAN ORATOR.   67

Immortal females of America! I will tell it to the
daughters of France, and they only are fit to applaud

you! You have attained the utmostof what your sex ’

is capable ; you possess the beauty, the simplicity, the

manners, at once natural and pure; the primitive
graces of the golden age. It was among you thatlliber-.

ty was first to have its origin. But the empire of free-
dom which is extended to France, 15 about to carry
your manners along with it, and produce a revolution

‘in morals as Well as in politics.

Already our female citizens, (for they have lately
become such) are not any longer occupied with those
frivolous ornaments, and vain pleasures, which were

nothing more than the amusements of slavery; they“

have awakened the love of liberty in the bosomsof
fathers. e of brothers, and of husbands; they have en-
couraged them to make the most generous sacriﬁces;
their delicate hands have removed the earth, drag ed
it along, and helped to elevate the immense amphit e-
atre of the grand confederation. It is. no longer the
love of voluptuous softness that attracts their -regard;
it is the sacred ﬁre of patriotism.

The laws which are to reform education, and with
it the national manners, are already prepared; they
will advance; they will fortify the éause of liberty by
means of their happy influence, and become the second
saviours of their country!

Franklin did not omit any of the means of being use-

ful to men,ior serviceable to society. He spoke to all.

conditions, to both sexes, to every age. This amiable
moralist descended, in his writings, to the mostiartless
details ; to the most ingenuous familiarities; to the ﬁrst
ideas of a rural, a commercial, and a civil life ; to the
dialogues of old men and children; full at once of all
th 4 ’ erdure and all the maturity of wisdom. In short,
the; dent lessons arising from the exposition of those
obscure, happy, easy virtues, which form so many links
in the chain of a good, man’s life, derived, immense
weight from that reputation for genius which he, had

acquired, by being one of the first naturalists and
greatest philosophers in the universe.

At one and the same time, he governed nature in the
heavens and in the hearts of men. Amidst the tem-
pests of the atmosphere,‘ he directed the thunder;
amidst the storms of society, he directed the passions.
Think, gentlemen, with what attentive docility, with
what religious respect, one must hear the voice ofa
simple man, who preached up human happiness, when
it was rceollected that it was the powerful voice of the
same man who regulated the lightning.

He electrified the consciences, in order to extract the
destructive fire of vice, exactly in the same manner as
he electrified the heavens, in order peaceably to invite
from them the terrible fire of the elements.

Venerable old man! august philosopher! legislator
of the felicity of thy country, prophet of the fraternity
of the human race, what ecstatic happiness embellish-
ed the end of thy career! From thy fortunate asylum,
and in the midst of thy brothers who enjoyed in tran-
quillity the fruit of thy virtues, and the success of .thy
genius, thou hast sung songs of deliverance. The last

ooks, which thou didst cast around thee, beheld Ame- -

rica happy; France, on the other side of.the ocean,
free, and a sure indication of the approaching freedom
and happiness of the world.

The United States, lookin upon themselves as thy
children, have bewailed the clieath of the father of their
republic. France, thy family by adoption, has hon-
ored thee as the founder of her laws; and the human
race has revered thee as the universal patriarch who
has formed the alliance ‘of nature with society. Th
remembrance belongs to all ages; thy memory to all
nations ; thy glory to eternity!

EPILOGUE TO ADmsoN’s Ciiro.

YOU see mankind the same in every age:

. Heroic fortitude, tyrannic rage,
Bpundlessambition, patriotic truth, i

And hoary treason, and untaintedyouth,

Have deeply mar-k’d all periods and all bclimes,
The noblest virtues, and the blackest crimes.
Did Cesar, drunk with power, and madly brave,
Insatiate burn, his country to enslave?

Did he for this, lead forth a servile host

T o spill the choicest blood that Rome could boast?
The British Cesar too hath done the same,
And doom’d this age to everlasting fame.
Columbia’s crimson’d ﬁelds still smoke with gore;
Her bravest heroes cover all the shore :

The ﬂower of Britain, in full martial bloom,

In this sad war, sent headlong to the tomb.

Did Rome’s brave senate nobly dare t’ oppose
The mighty torrent, stand confess’d their fees,
And boldly arm the virtuous few, and dare

The desp’rate horrors of unequal war?

Our senate too the same bold deed have done,
And for a Cato, arm’d a Washington ;

A chief, in all the ways of battle skill’d,

Great in the council, mighty in the field.

His martial arm, and steady soul alone,

Have made thy legions shake, thy navy groan,
And thy proud empire totter to the throne.
O,'what thou art, mayst thou forever be,

And death the lot of any chief but thee!

We’ve had our Decius too; and Howe could say

 it - th, pardon, peace, George sends America;
rou it destruction for the olive wreath;
ealtlt, contagion, and for pardon, death.

R ! then, my countrymen, for ﬁght prepare;
Gird on your swords, and fearless rush to war:

E HEN boys are exhibiting in public, the polite-,

To save the trouble ofanswers, so far as relates to my-
self, my name is Charles Chatterbox. I was born in
this town; and have grown to my present enormous
sutture, without any artiﬁcial help. It is true, I eat.
drink, and sleep, and take as much care of my noble
self, as any young man about; but I am a monstrous’
great student. Thene is no telling the half of what I

‘Why, what do you think of the Arabian Tales?
Truth! every word truth! There’s the story of the

read every word of them. And I have read Tom

every few pages, is a picture of him to the lite.

I have also read Robinson Crusoe, and Rcynard the
fox, and Moll Flanders; and I have read twelve de-
lightful novels, and Irish Rogues, and Life of Saint
Patrick, and Philip Quarle, and Conjurer Crop, and
1Esop’s Fables, and Laugh and be fat, and 'I‘ob_v Lump-
kin’s Elegy on the Birth of a Child, and a Comedy on
the Death of his Brother, and an Acrostic, occasioned
by a mortal sickness of his dear wife, of which she re-
covered. This famous author wrote a treatise on the
Rise and Progress of Vegetation: and a whole Body of
Divinity he comprised in four lines.

memory was so extraordinary, that he never forgot
the hours of eating and sleepincr. This Pero was a
rare lad. Why, he could stand on his head, as if it
were a real pedestal ; his feet he used for drumsticks.
He was trumpeter to the foot guards in Queen Betty’s
time; and if he had not blown his breath away, might
have lived to this day.

Then, I have read the history of a man who married
for money, and of a woman that would wear her hus-
band’s small-clothes in spite of him; and I have read
four books of riddles and rebusses; and all that is not
half a quarter. ‘

Now, what signiﬁes reading so much if one can’t tell
of it? In thinking over these things, I am sometimes
so lost in company, that I don’t hear any thing that is
said, till some one pops out that witty saying, “ A
penny for your thoughts.” Then I say, to be sure,
Iﬁs thinking of a book I had been reading. Once.

THE COIJUMBIANO ORATOR. .75

A prodigy, that to the World announc’d

A new religion and dissolv’d the old: . \
The temple’s sacred Vail was rent in twain
From top to bottom, ’midst th’ attesting shocks
Of earthquake and the I-ending up of graves.
Now those mysterious symbols, heretofore
Curtain’d from vulgar eyes, and holiest deem’d
Of holies, were display’d to public view :~

The mercy-seat, with its cherubic wings .
O’ershadoWed, and the golden ark beneath
Cov’ring the testimony, now through the rent
Of that dissever’d Vail ﬁrst saw the light ;

A world redeem’d had now no farther need

Of types and emblems, dimly shadowing forth

» An angry Deity withdrawn from sight

And canopied in clouds. Him, face to face,
Now in full light reveal’d, the dying breath,
Of hisdear Son a_ppeas’d, and purchas’d peace

- And reconcilement for offending man. &

Thus the partition wall, by Moses built,

By Christ was levell’d, and the Gentile world
Enter’cl the breach, by their great Captain led
Up to the throne of grace, opening himself
Through his own ﬂesh atnew and living way.
Then’ were the oracles of God made known
To all the nations, sprinkled by theyblood ' »
Of Jesus, and baptiz’d into his death ; ’
So was the birthright of the elder born,
Heirs of the promise, forfeited; whilst they,
Whom sin had erst in bondage held, made free
From sin, and servants of the living God,
Now gain’d the gift -of God, eternal life. »

A Soon as those signs and prodigies were seen
Of those who_ watch’d the cross, conviction smote .
Their fear-struck hearts. The sun, at noon-day dark:
The earth convulsive underneath their feet,
And the ﬁrm rocks, in shiver’d fragments rent,
Rous’d them at once to tremble and believe.
Then was our Lord by heathen lips confess’d,

:6   i*1‘H“’E COLUMBIANORATOR;

When the centurion cry’d,In very truth
This righteous Person was the Son of God;
The rest, in heart assenting, stood abash’d,
Watching in silence the tremendous scene. -

The recollection of his gracious acts,
His dying pray’rs and their own impious taunts’
Now rose in sad review; too late they wish’d
The deed undone, and sighing smote their breasts.

Straight from God’s presence went that angel forth.

Whose trumpet shall call up the sleeping dead

At the last day, and bade the saints arise

And come on earth to hail this promis’d hour,

The day-sprin‘ of salvation. Forth they came‘
From their dar tenements, their shadowy forms
Made visible as in their ﬂeshly state,

And through the holy city here and there L
Frequent they g1eam’d, by night, by day, with fear
And wonder seen of many : holy seers,

, Prophets and martyrs from the grave set free,

And the first fruits of the redeemed dead.
They, who with Christ transﬁ ur’d on the mount
Were seen of his ‘disciples in a c oud‘ ‘

t Of dazzling glory, now, in form distinct,

Mingling amidst the public haunts of men,
Struck terror to all hearts : Ezekiel there,
The captive seer, to whom on Chebar’s banks
The hea,_ven’s were open’d and the fatal roll
Held forth, withdire denunciations ﬁll’d,

Of lamentlationfmournin , and of Woe,

Now falling fast on lsrae ’s wretched race :

a He too was there, Hilkiah’s holy son,

With loins close girt, and -glowing lips of ﬁre

By God’s own ﬁnger touch’d: there might be“‘seen s

The yjoiithful prophet, Belteshazzar nam’d
Of the‘”Gl1“aldees, interpreter of dreams, '

Knowledge of God bestow’d, in visions skill’d,
And fair, and learn’d, and wise: the Baptist here;

doors, then, with irresistible impetuosity, they rush

forth, scattering dread, and menacing destruction.
The atmosphere is hurled into the most tumultuous

78 THE COLUMBIAN ORAT OR.

Her sturdy sons are strained to the very root, * and a].
most sweep the soil they were wont to shade. The
stubborn oak, that disdains to bend, is dashed head-
long to = the ground; and, with shattered arms, with
prostrate trunk, blocks up the mad, VVhile the ﬂexile
reed, that springs up in the marsh, yielding to the gust,
(as the meek and pliant temper, to injuries, or the re-
signed and patient spirit, to misfortunes) eludes the
force of the storm, and survives amidst the wide-spread
havoc.

For a moment, the turbulent and outrageous sky
seems to be assuaged; but it intermits its warmth, only
to increase its strength. Soon the sounding squadrons
of the air return to the attack, and renew their ravages
with redoublcd fury. The stately dome rocks amidst
the wheeling clouds. The impregnable tower totters
on its basis, and threatens to overwhelm whom it was
intended to protect. The ragged rocks are rent in
pieces ; and even the bills, the perpetual hills, on their
deeprfoundations are scarcely secure. Where now is
the plaééiof safety? when the city reels, and houses
become heapsl Sleep affrighted ﬂies. Diversion is
turned into horror. "All is uproar in the elements; all
is consternation among mortals; and nothing but one
wide scenevof rueful devastation through the land.

The ocean swells with tremendous commetions. The
ponderous waves are heaved from their capacious bed,
and almost lay  the unfathomable deep. Flung in-
to the most ra'pid‘ag‘itation, they sweep over the rocks ;
they lash the lofty cliffs,‘ and toss themselves into the
clouds. Navies are rent from their anchors; and, with
all their enormous load, are whirled swift as the arrow,

DIALOGUE ON PHYs;oGNomY.

T a nears strance to me that eo Ie can be
Frank‘ I S0rI)I111pOSC(I upobn. There is lie difficulty in
judging folks by their looks. I profess to know as
much of a man, at the ﬁrst view, as by half a dozen“,
years acquaintance.

Henry. Pray how is that done? I. should wish to
learn such an art. a I '

Fr. Did you never read Lavater on Physio nomy 2

Hen. N 0. What do you mean  such a liar word ?

Fr. I Physiognomy means a knowledge of I men’s
hearts, thoughts, and characters, by their looks. For
instance, if you see a man, with a. foreheadjuttin over
his eyes like a piazza, with a pair of eyebrows, eavy
like the ‘cornice of a house ; with full eyes, and a Ro-
man nose, depend on it he isa great scholar, and an
honest man. L ‘ '  s ’

Hen. It seems to me I should rather go below his
nose to discover his scholarship. V ,

Fr. By no means : if you look for beauty, you may
descend to the mouth and chin; ‘otherwise never go
below the region of the. brain. ' - »

I . Enter GEORGE. j
iG'eor. Well, I have been to see the man hanged.
And he is gone to the other world, with just such a
great forehead and Romannose, as you have always
been praising. , s

Fr. Remember, George, all signs fail in 
weather. .

Geor. Now‘, be honest, Frank, and dwn that there

is nothing in all this trumpery of yours. The only way
to know men is by their actions. If a man commit
burglary, think you a Roman nose ought to save him
from punishment? ‘

Fr. 1 don’t carry my notions so far as that; but
it is certain. that all faces in the world are different;

'and equally true, that each has some marks about it,

by which one can discover the temper and character
of the person.
Enter PETER.

Peter. [to Frank.] Sir, I have heard of your fame
from Dan to Beersheba ; that youcan know a man by
his face, and can tell his thoughts by his looks. Hear-
ing this, I have visited you without the ceremony of an
introduction.

Fr. Why, indeed, I do profess something in that

wa . « .

ﬁat. By that forehead, nose, and those eyes of
youﬁs, one might be sure of an acute, penetrating
min .,

Fr. I see that you are not ignorant of physiog-
nomy. « e - V I
Pet. I am not; but still lam so far from being an
ade tin the art, that, unless the features are very re-
mar able, I cannot determine with certainty. But
yours is the most striking face I ever saw. There is a
certain ﬁrmness in the lines, which lead from the outer
verge to the centre of the apple of your eye, which
denotes great forecast, deep thought, bright invention,
and a genius for great purposes.

Fr. You are a perfect master of the art. And to
show you that I know something of it, permit me to
observe, that the form of your face denotes frankness,
truth, and honesty. Your heart is a stranger to guile,
your lips, to deceit, and your hands, to fraud.

Pet. I must confess that you have hit upon my true
character; though a different one, from what I have
sustained in the view of the world.

examp es of the truth of physxognorny. [While he is
speaking, this, Peter takes out h.2sjJ0Ck€t-599/5, and makes

out this knowledge, I could fathom the character of as
total stranger? _

Hen. Pray tell us by what marks you discovered
that in his heart and lips was no guile, and in his
hands, no fraud ? ‘ y .

Fr. Aye, leave that to me; we are not to reveal
our secrets. But I will show you a face and character,
which exactly suits him. [Feelsfor his pocket-book in
both pockets, loo/ts wildly and concerned.]

Geor. [Tauntingly.] ‘Aye, “in his heart is no

uile, in his lips no deceit, and in his hands no fraud!
glow we see a strong example of the power of physi-
ognomy !” ‘ \ ,

fers to go.]

Hen. Stop a moment. His ﬁnethonest face is far
enough before this time. You have not yet discover-

him tosteal. i
Hen. By his deceitful lips, he has robbed you of
any just conception of yourself; he has betrayed you
into a foolish belief that you are possessed of most ex-
traordinary genius and talents. Whereas, separate
from the idle whim about physiognomy, you have had
no more pretence to genius or learning than a common
school-bog. Learn henceforth to estimate men’s hands
by their eeds, their lips, by their words, and their
hearts, by their lives. ‘

ORATION DELIVERED AT PARIS BY CITIZEN Can.
NOT, PRESIDENT or THE EXECUTIVE Dnuzcroar
AT THE FESTIVAL or GRATITUDE AND VICTORY,
CELEBRATE!) AT THE CHAMP-DE-MARS, MAY 29,
1796.

T is at the moment when nature is renovated, when
the earth, adorned with ﬂowers and dressed in green,
promises new harvests; when all bein s proclaim in
their own langua e, the beneﬁcent Inte ligence which
renovates the universe, that the French people assem-
ble,on this great festival,to render a distinguished hom-
age to those talents and virtues of the friends of the
country and humanity. What day can better unite
all hearts! What citizen, what men can be a stranger
to the inﬂuence of gratitude! We exist only through an
uninterrupted course of beneﬁcence, and our life is but
a continual exchange of services.
As soon as born, our eyes, ﬁxed on the heavens,
appear already to acknowledge a primary Benefactor.
eak, without support, the love of our parents watches
over our infancy, and provides for wants continually
renewed. They direct our first steps; their patient
solicitude assists in developing our organs ; we receive
from them our first ideas of what we are ourselves, and
of surrounding objects. Additional care models our
hearts to affection, our minds to knowledge, and our
bodies to useful labor. It is for our happiness, that
the wise have reflected on the duties of man ; that the
learned have (liven into the secrets of nature ; that the
ma istrate watches, and that the legislator prepares in
deli eration protecting laws. ,
Soon we are enabled to be useful. Good children:
we strew ﬂowers over the age of our parents, and their
trembling voice blesses us in their last moments. Be-
come parents in our turn, we prepare, in the education
of our children, the felicity of our declining years;

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. es

and we thus continue ina new generation the chain of
benevolence and gratitude. Sensibility is not restricted
within the family circle; the indigent is searched for
under the thatch; succours and consolation are lavish-
ed ; and the donor, at first paid for the good action by
the pleasure of having perforrned it, is doubly rewarded
by the gratitude of the Ol)J€Ct. Benevolence! how
happy are thy votaries, and how inuchto be pitied, the
soul that knows thee not! .

He who is a good son and a good father is also a
good citizen. He loves his country ; renders with
alacrity the tribute of services; he delights in return-
ing to his brothers the protection he has receivedfrom
them. Either magistrate or warrior, manufacturer or
farmer; in the temple of the arts; in the Senate ; in the
fields of glory, or the workshops of industry, he shows

himself ambitious of contributing towards the prosper- .
ity of his country, and to deserve one day its rati— ’

Iude. For there is a national gratitude for indivi uals.
At this moment a people are all assembled to express
their ratitude to the virtuous citizens who have de-
server? it. How agreeable is the task! How we delight
in paying you that homage; you to whom the country
owes its safety, its glory, and the foundation of “its
prosperity ! 4 ‘ * ‘

You, to whom France owes its political regeneration ;
courageous philosophers, whose Writings have planted
the seeds of the revolution, corroded the letters of sla-
very, and blunted by degrees the ravings of fanaticism.
You, citizens, whose dauntless courage effected this
happy revolution; founded the republic, and contend-
ed these seven years against crime and ambition, royal-
ism and anarchy. You all, in a word, who labor to

' render France happy and ﬂourishing; who render it

illustrious by your talents, and enrich it by your dis-
coveries; receive the solemn testimony of national
gratitude.

‘Receive that testimony particularly, republican ar-
mies ; you, whose glory and successes are fresh in the

34 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

recollection of all. It is you who have defended us
against ten combined kings; who have driven them
from our territory; have transferred to their dominions
the scourge of war. You have not only conquered
men ; you have overcome the obstacle thrown in your
way by nature. You have triumphed over fatigue,
hunger, and winter. What a spectacle for the people!
what a dreadful lesson to the enemies of liberty!

A new-born republic arms its children to defend its
independence ; nothing can restrain their impetuosity;
traversin rivers, carrying entrenchments, climbin
rocks. ere, after a series of victories, they pusheil
back our limits to those barriers tltatmature intended
for us, and pursuing over ice the remains of three ar-
mies, transformed an oppressed and hostile nation into
a free and allied people. There they fly to exterminate
the ‘hordes of traitors and villains, subsidized by En-

land; punish their thieves, and restore to the repub-
lic brothers too long misled. Here, surmounting the
Pyrenees, and precipitating themselves from their sum-
mit; overthrowing whatever op oses their progress,
and checked only by an honoragale peace; there as-
cendinrr the Alps and Appenines, they fly across the
Po am Adige.

The ardor of the soldier is seconded by the genius
and boldness of the chiefs. They plan with science,
and execute with energy; now displaying their forces
with calmness; then courting danger at the head of
their brothers in arms. Oh thatl could here display
the immense and glorious picture of their victories!
that I could name our most intrepid defenders! What
a crowd of sublime images and beloved names press

. upon my recollection! Immortal warriors, posterity

will not believe the multitude of your triumphs ; but to
us history loses all itsimprobabilities.

But do we not see, even; on this spot, a portion of
those brave defenders ? Victors over the exterior ene-
mies of the state, they have come to‘ repress our inter-
nal enemies; and preserve at home the republic

THE COLU1\/INBIAN ORATOR. ‘ 35

which they have caused to be respected abroad. Do
we not also see those venerable warriors who have
grown grey in the service; those whom honorable
wounds have obliged to seek premature repose, and
whose asylum is in sight? With what pleasure our
eyes feed on thiseinteresting reunion! VVith what
agreeable emotions we contemplates those victorious
brows! ‘ ‘ »

Heroes who have perished for liberty, why does there
remain to us nothing but a recollection of your servci'es?
You will. however, live forever in our hearts; your
rhildren will be dear to us ; the republic will repay to
them the debt they owe to you; and we discharge
here the first, by proclaiming your glory and our grat-
itude. Republican armics, represented here,by war-
riors from your ranks; invincibleephalanxes, whose
-trophies l observe on all sides, whose fresh successes
‘I foresee, come forward and receive the triumphal
crowns which the French people command met to at.-
tach to your colours. ‘

MR. PRESIDENT, ~

COME to acquit myself of a duty ver dear to my

When she broke her chain; when she proclaimed
theimprescriptible rights of man; when, in a terrible

own, and doubl rejoiced in her victories, which, in
assuring to her t e enjoyments of her rights, became to
them new guarantees of their independence.

These sentiments, which animated the French na-
tion, from the dawn of their revolution, have acquired
new strength since the foundation of the republic.
France, at that time, bythe form of its government, as-
similated to, or rather identified with free people, saw
in them only friends and brothers. Long accustomed
to regard the American people as their most faithful
allies, she has sought to draw closer the ties already
formed in the ﬁelds of America, under the auspices of
victory over the ruins of tyranny.

The National Convention, the organs of the will of
the French Nation, have more than once expressed
their sentiments to the American eople ; but above all,
these burst forth on that august ay, when the Minister
of the United States presented to the National Repre-
sentation, the colours of his country, desiring never to
lose recollections as dear to Frenchmen as they must
be to Americans. The Convention ordered that these
colours should be placed in the hall of their sittings.
They had experienced sensations too agreeable not to
cause them to be partaken of by their allies, and de-
creed that to them the national colours should be pre-
sented.

Mr. President, I do not doubt their expectations will
be fulﬁlled; and I am convinced, that every citizen will
receive, with a pleasing emotion, this ﬂag, elsewhere
the terror of the enemies of liberty; here the certain
pledge of faithful friendship; especially when they
reco ect that it guides to combat, men who have
shared their toils, and who were prepared for liberty,
by aiding them to acquire their own.

PRESIDENT WASHINGTON,S ANSWER.

ORN, Sir, in a land of liberty; having early
learned its value; having engaged in a perilous
conflict to defend it; having, in a word, devoted the
best years of my life to secure it a permanent establish-

ment" in my own country; my anxious recollections,
‘my sympathetic feelings, and my best wishes are irre-

sistibly excited, wliensoever, in any country, I see an
oppressed nation unfurl the banners of freedom. But
above all, the events of the French revolution have pro-
duced the deepest solicitude, as well as the highest
admiration. To call your nation brave, were to pro-

nounce but common praise. WONDERFUL PEO-

PLE! ages to come will read with astonishment the
history of your brilliant exploits. »

I rejoice that the period of your toils and of your
immense sacriﬁces is approaching. I rejoice that the
interesting revolutionary movements of so many years
have issued in the formation of a constitution designed

to give permanency to the great object for which you

have contended. I rejoice that liberty, which you

have so long embraced with "enthusiasm; liberty, of
which you have been the invincible" defenders, now
ﬁnds an asylum in the bosom of a regularly organized
government: a government, which, being formed to
secure the happiness of the French people, corresponds
with the ardent wishes of my heart, while it gratiﬁes
the pride of every citizen of the United States, by its
resemblance of their own. On these glorious events
accept, Sir, my sincere congratulations.

In delivering to_you these sentiments, I express not

my own feelings only, but those of my ‘fellow-citizens,”
. in relation to the commencement, the progress, and the

issue of the French revolution; and they will cordi-

ally join with me in purestwishes to the Supreme Be- I

ing, that the citizens of our ‘sister republic, our’mag-

as THE COLUMBIA-N ORATOR.

nanimous allies, may soon enjoy, in peace, that liberty
which they have purchased at so great a price, and all
the happiness which liberty can bestow.

I receive, Sir, with lively sensibility, the symbol of
the triumphs and of the enfranchisements of your na-

tion, the colours of France, which you have now pre-‘

sented to the United States. The transaction will be
announced to Congress ; and the colours will be depos-
ited with those archives of the United States, which
are at once the evidences and the memorials of their
freedom and independence. May these be perpetual;
and may the friendship of the two ‘republics be com-
mensuratc with their existence.

Tm; OPPRESSIVE LANDLORD.

Enter Don PHILIP and WIFE.

. . ‘ N 7ELL, my dear, I have warned all
Do” Pkwy‘ the families out of my long range

of buildings, and ordered them to ay double e rent
they have done, for every day t ey' remain. From
every new tenant l am determined to have three times
the sum. The present rent will never do in these times.
Our children will become beggars at this rate; and you
and I shall have to hetake ourselves to hand labour,
like the common herd, to earn our daily bread.

Wife. But I fear that some of our tenants are too
poor to endure a rent, double to what they now pay;
and I am certain it will be impossible for them all to
Pt’l"l'l0\"C, on account of the scarcity of houses to be ob-
tainetl.

Don P. That is not my look out. It is enough for
me to attend to my own interest, not theirs.

Wife. But you will exercise a little lenity towards
them, at this distressing time. I am persuaded, my
dear, that you will not turn them into the street. Be-
sides, it is thought by some, that they already pay a
reasonable rent. a ‘

THE COLUMBIAN’ ORATOR.   I 89

Don P. I have nothing to do with lenity. Woman,
would you not have your husband be looking out against
a rainyday? What would become of -you, and.your
children, if I were to spend my time in studying lenity,
instead of my interest-table .7 I ,tell you, that now is the
harvest time, and I. am determined to thrust in the sic-
kle, and reap my proportion of the crop, before the sea-
son’s over. - The town is crowded with foreigners who
are exiled from their homes, and necessity obliges them

" to pay whatever price is demanded, for a shelter to

cover their heads.
Wzfe. Would you then proﬁt by the necessities and

misfortunes of your fellow creatures ? These exiles are i

entitled to our compassion, instead of experiencing our
oppression. - , ' “
Don P. You talk like a poor weak woman. Did I

not tell you that I had nothing to do w-ith other peo- .
A ple’s good or ill fortune? It is more than I can do to

take care of my own dependants. We should make

.ﬁne way ahead, if.you were at helm. Ibelieve in my

conscience, that, if you possessed the keys of the strong
box, you would squander away to the full amount ‘of
apistareen a week upon these poor starving runaways.
I have not yet forgotten how you lavished a whole gal-
lon of cider upon those three miserable wretches that
cleared out our well, the day before thanksgiving.
Does this look like takinga prudent care o.f your fam-
ily? Pray how do you read your Bible? Has not
N ebuchadnezzar said, that “ He, who provides notfor
his own household, has denied the faith, and is worse
than an inﬁdel?” .  ,
Wzfe. If you had studied your Bible as faithfully
as you have your interest-table, you would not have

put St. Paul’s words into the mouth of the king of ’'

Babylon. Does not the same scripture say, that “ He

who oppresseth the poor, and ”

 

Don P. Hush, I say; one of my tenants approaches.
Banish your womanish feelings‘; and let not «your;un-
ruly tongue betray your weakness.

90 THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.

Enter TENANT. »
Ten. Sir.‘ I come to inform you, thatl have at last
been fortunate enough to procure a shelter for my tam»
ily, though an indifferent one; and have brought you

the rent of your tenement, which I qnitted with re-

luctance yesterday.

Don P. It is well you are out; for you would have
met with trouble, ifyou had remained three days longer.
l had ordered my attorney to give directions to an othcer
to tumble all your goods into the street, and you and
your children after them. 

Tan. T hen a good Providence has preserved us.

Don. P. Providence has smiled upon me, I confess,
in ‘ ranting me such a riddance.

' en. I contend notkwith an adversary who is man-
tled in gold. Will you please to count your money,

and give me a discharge ?

Don P. [Counts the money.] Why, man, the sum is t

deﬁcient ; I cannot receipt it.

Ten. It is the same, Sir, as Ipaid the last term.

Don P. That is very true ; but did I not double the
rentthree days ago? ‘ l 9

Ten. You did, indeed; but my reply was, that l
was utterly unable to pay a higher price; and as the
time was so short, I thought you would not stand for
trifles.

Don P. Trifles! If you were to receive it, I believe

— you would not call it a triﬂe; neither do I. I demand

the utmost fartliing.

Ten. For the sake of peace, though I think your de-
mand unjust, I will take your receipt for this, and
bring the romainde to-morrow.

Don P. Not a cent will I receive Without the whole,
lest by some quibble of the law I lose the rest.

Ten. YOul‘__,a\’al'iCi0uS disposition leads you to act
contrary to your own interest. .

Don P. Ishall not apply to you for lessons of in-
struction. I shall conduct my own all"airs accordin to
my sovereign will and pleasure Let me tell ybu,§1r,

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR. 91

~ this impudence does not well become a man of your

circumstances.

Ten. “ Sir, your honored father never used me
thus.” Alas! he little thought in what oppressive
hands he left his large estate. Could he be permit-
ted to revisit the earth, his ghost would haunt your guilty
soul ; and, if you have any conscience left, harrow up
remorse, and awaken you to repentance.

Don P. I did not admit a tenant into my house to
hear a moral lecture from him. “

Ten. If you will take your money, I will quit your
house with pleasure. But before we part, give me leave

to tell you, that, though your great wealth has exalted

you above yourself, and, in your own opinon, placed
you beyond the reach of ‘ poverty, the time may come
when you willfeel what oppression is.

content, ’

portant business, may take a modest hint to leave the
room. [Exit Wzfe.

to me. Had he left it to one of only common under-
standing, these plotting tenants would have run away
with the whole of it. .

Enter second TENANT.

2d. Tenant. Sir, I appear before you to craveyyour
compassion. I am the most unfortunate of all your
tenants. My misfortune is, to be obliged to remain
in your house, after it is your pleasure that I should
leave it.

Don P. To-morrow I will cure you of your misfor-
tune; for if you cannot get out yourself, I will help
you out.

Qd. Ten. Why may I not remain? It may be lbr
your interest as well as mine. I have ever made you
punctual payment; and stand ready now to give as

-much as any other man, or as much as your conscience

will suffer you to demand. _ 1

Don P. My will and pleasure is, that you depart
immediately. My reasons for my conduct I give to no
man.

2d. Ten. But, Sir, I have a claim upon your mercy.

You are not insensible of the pains I’ve taken to accom-.

plish what you wish. Necessity is the only reason why
ask this favour. One special reason why you oughttto
grant it is, that I am now in your service with the same
salar as in years past; when your good father was
satis ed with one fourth the sum his craving son de-
mands. I have been, you must allow, a faithful slave
to your children. They have long received, and still
receive my best instruction, without an augmentation
of reward. If you will not hear the plea of mercy,
grant me justice. If you increase your price of rent,
increase my pay.

Don P. I meddle not with your affairs. Look out
for your pay among your employers. I am but one
among many, and promise you that I shall not be fore-
most to enhance the price of instruction, while children

are so numerous. My houses are my own. Ibought

2d. Ten. You speak as though you were lord of the
creation, and had the world at your command.

Don P. I am lord of my own possessions ; and shall
not ask my tenants how I am to dispose of them.

Qd. Ten. Did you ever read, that “ Riches take to

themselves wings, and fly away ?”

Don P. I am not apprehensive that anyiwings are
attached to my property.

2a’. Tm. Your mountain may not stand so strong as
you think it does. The cries ofthe fatherless and the

widow, who have groaned under your oppression, have ‘

reached the heavens, and you have reason to fear they
will be answered with vengeance on your head. Did
you but believe in a future day of retribution, as you

Loan MANsi‘ir:LD’s SPEECH, IN SUPPORT or A BILL
FOR raeveurma DELAYS or Jusrxcs, BY REASON
or Pzuvxtses. or PARLIAMENT, 1770.

MY Loans,

HAVE waited with atience to hear what argu-
ments might be urge against the bill; but I have
waited in vain; the truth is, there is no argument that
can vreigh against it. The justice and expediency of
the bill are such as render it self-evident. It is a propo-
sition of that nature, that can neither be weakened by
argkxlment, nor entangled with so histry. e , N
c all know, that the very sou and essence of trade
are regular payments; and sad experience teaches us,

THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR.   95

mat there are men, who will not make their regular

payments without the compulsive power of the laws.

The law then ought to be equally open to all. Any
exemption to particulargmen, or particular ranks of
men, is, in a free and commercial country, a solecism

of the rossest nature.

\

I wil not trouble your lordships with arguments for
that which is sufﬁciently evident without any. I shall
only say a few Words to some noble lords, who fore-
see much inconveniency from the persons of their ser-.
vants being liable to be arresterl. One noble lord ob-A
serves, that the coachman of a peer may be arrested
while he is driving his master to the House ; and, con-
sequently, he will not be able to attend his duty in
Parliament. If this -were actually to happen, there are

so many ways by which the member might still get to -4

the House, that I can hardly think the noble lord is se-
rious in his objection. Another noble peer said, that
by this billwe might lose our most valuable and honest

servants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms: ,
for he can neither be a valuable servant, nor an honest i

man, who gets into debt which he is neither able nor
willing to pay, till compelled by law.

If my servant, by unforeseen accidents, has run into
debt, and I still wish to retain him, I certainly would
pay the debt. But upon no principle of liberal legis-

atxon whatever, can my servant have a title to set his

creditors at deﬁance, while for forty shillings only, the
honest traclesman may be torn from his family, and
locked up In a jail. It is monstrous injustice! I ﬂat-
ter _myse f, however, the determination of this day will
entirely put an end to all such partial proceedings for
the future,1_>y passin into a law the bill now under
your lordships’ consi eration. -

Icome now to speak, upon what, indeed,I would
have gladl avoided, had I not been particularly point-

ed at for I 6 part I have taken in this bill. It has ’

after-ages on good and virtuous actions, 1 h€1\‘0 l0H2;
been struggling in that race. But il'_ he mean_ that
mushroom popularity,which is raised without merit and
lost without a crime, he much mistakes in his opinion.

i defy the noble lord to point out a single action of
mv life, where the popularity of the times ever had
tire smallest inﬂuence on my determinations. l have a
more permanent and steady rule for my conduct, the
dictates of my own breast. Those who liuve forgone
that pleasing adviser, and given up their mind to be the
iilave of every popular impulse, l sincerely pity. I
pity them still more, if their vanity leads them to mis-
take the shouts of a mob for the trumpet of fame. Ex~
perience might inform them, that many who have been
saluted with the huzzas of a crowd, one day, have
received their execrations the next; and many, who,
by the popularity oftheir times. have been held up as
spotless patriots, have, nevertheless, appeared upon the
historian’s page, when truth has triumphed over delu-
sion, the assassins of libert .

Why then the noble lor can think I am ambitious
of present popularity, that echo of folly,and shadow of
renown, l am at a loss to determine. Besides, I do
not know that the bill now before your lordships will
be popular. It depends much upon the capriceof the
day. it may not be popular to compel people to pay
their debts; and, in that case, the present must be a
very unpopular bill. It may not be popular neither
to take away any of the privileges of parliament; for
I very well remember, and many of your lordships
may remember, that not long ago the popular cry was
for the extension of privilege; and so far did they
carry it at that time, that it was said that the privilege
protected members even in criminal actions. Nay, such
was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds,
that the ver decisions of some‘ of the courts were tinc-
tured with t at doctrine. T
