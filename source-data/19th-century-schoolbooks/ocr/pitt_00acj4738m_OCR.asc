the pears were to be “gathered, and the children Were
to have a treat.

9. Harry, in his ‘impatience, thought the morning
would never be over. He played such pranks, buffet-
ing Frisk,cutting the curls off Annie’s doll, and ﬁnally
breaking his grandmother’s +spectacles, that before his
+visitors +arrived, indeed, almost immediately after
dinner, he ‘‘contrived to be sent to bed in disgrace.

while Jane, and William, and Annie, were busy about
the ﬁne, mellow *.Windsor pears. William was up in

W "catching them in their aprons, and picking them up

from the ground; now piling them in baskets, and
now eating the nicest and ripest»; while Frisk was

barking gayly among them, as if he were catching

Windsor pears, too.

11. Poor )£Harry! Hecould hear all this glee and
‘Fmerriment through the open window, as he ‘lay in
bed. The storm of passion having subsided, there he
lay weeping and disconsolate, a +grievous sob, bursting
forth every now and then, as he heard the loud peals

of childish laughter, and as he thought how he should
have laughed, and how happy he should have been,
had he not forfeited ‘all this pleasure by his own bad
conduct 4

12. He ltwondered if Annie would not be so good-
natured as to bring him a pear. All on a sudden, he
heard a little foot on the stair, pitapat, and he thought
she was coming. Pitapat came the foot, nearer and
nearer, and at last a small head peeped, half-afraid,
through the half-open door.

13. But it was nott_Annie’s head; it was Frisk’s—--
poor Friskfwhom Harry had been “teasing and +tor-
menting all the morning, and who came into the room
wagging his tail, with a great pear in his mouth, and,
jumping upon the bed, he laid it in the little boy’s
hand. v

.14. Is not Frisk a ﬁne, grateful fellow? and does he
not deserve a share of Harry’s breakfast, whether he
begs for it or not? And little Harry will remember

from the events of this day, that kindness, even though

shown to a dog, will always be rewarded; and that ill-
nature and bad-temper are connected with nothing but
pain and disgrace.

E X E R C I s E s .—What is the subject of this lesson? Who took

the little dog’s part when he had no friend? How did Harry lose

his share in the ho1iday’s sport? How did Frisk show’ his,grat-
itude to his master? What will Harry learn from the events of
this day? 2

1. THE Frost looked forth one still, clear night,
And “Whispered, “Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the ’"valley, and over the ‘height,

In'+silence I’ll take my Way;
Twill not go on, like that blustering train,
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,
Who make so much +bustle and noise in vain,

But I’ll be as busy as they.”

2. Then he flew to the mountain, and +poWdered its
a crest; .
He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed
In ‘diamond beads; and over the breast
Of the quivering lake, he spread
A coat of mail, that need not fear
The downward point of many a spear,
That he hung on its margin, far and near,
Where la rock could rear its head.

THE ECLECTIC SERIES 105

3. He Went to the window of those who slept,
And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;
Whereverhe breathed, wherever he stepped,

By the light of the morn were seen

Most beautiful things; there were ﬂowers and T

trees;
There were bevies of birds, and swarms of bees;
There were cities with temples and towers, and
these
All pictured in silver sheen.

4. But he did one thing, that was hardly fair;

He peeped in the "cupboard, and ﬁnding there
i That all had ‘forgotten for him to prepare,
“Now just to set them a-thinking,
I’ll bite this basket of fruit,” said he, i
“This costly +pitcher I’ll burst in three’;
’ And the glass of water they ’ve left for me
Shall +‘tchickl’ to tell them I’m drinking.”

E x E R c I s E s .-—What did the frost say? What did he do to the
mountain? The trees? The lake? The window? The pitcher?

1. Child. How long will the swan live?

2. Parent. It is not known. A goose has been
known to live a hundred years, and from the ﬁrmer
"texture of the ﬂesh of the swan, that would probably
live longer.

3. 0’. Does the swan sing?

4. P. No, I believe not. The ancients usedto sup»
pose that it did; but it is now '*understood that it
utters only a kind of shrill hiss or whistle.

5. 0’. But Tom told me that he read in a. poem of
thesong of the dying swan. Is it not true, that the
swan ever sings when it is dying?

6. P. Poems do not always tell what is true. They
sometimes instruct by using fables. This is one of
the fables of the ancients. But I can tell you about

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 107

a death that is +equally beautiful, and it is all true.
Shall I tell it to you?

7. C’. 0 yes, I want to hear it.

8. P. Swartz was a missionary, that is, one who left
his own country to preach the gospel to the heathen.
He died at the age of seventy-two, having been a
missionary forty-eight years in India. He had such
a high character among the heathen, that he was suf—
fered to pass through savage and lawless tribes un-
Inolested. They said, “Let him alone, let him pass;
he is a man of Grodl” A tyrant, named Hyder Ali,
while he refused to enter into a treaty with others,
said, “Send me Swartz; send me the +Christian mis-
sionary to treat with me, for him only can I trust,”

9. The people had been so *cruelly used, that they
left their lands, and refused to_ raise any thing. All
they had raised had been "seized and taken away.
The whole country would soon have been in a famine.
The +heathen ruler ‘promised justice, and tried to in-
duce them to go back to their farms; but all in vain.

They Would not ‘“believe him. Swartz then wrote to

them, making the same promises. Seven thousand men
returned to their lands in one day. I I

10. When he came to die, he lay for a time appar-
ently lifeless. One of his friends, a worthy fellow-
laborer from the same country, *supposing that he
was actually dead, began to chant over his remains a.
stanza of a +favorite +hymn, which they used to sing
together to ’*soothe each other, in his life-time.

11. The verses were sung through without a motion
or a sign of life from the still form before him; but
when the last clause was over, the voice, which was
supposed to be hushed in death, took up the second
stanza of the same hymn, completed it with a distinct

and sweet utterance, and then was hushed, and was

heard no more. The soul rose with the last strain.

108 NEW FOURTH READER.

12. Is not this more touching and beautiful than the
fable about the dying swan? I hope you will remem-
ber it, and whenever you read of the swan, you will
‘irecollect this story, and think how sweetly death
comes to a good man, who has +faithfully ifollowed

Jesus Christ.

13. How sweet to think that on our eyes,
A lovelier clime shall yet arise;
That we shall wake from sorrow’s dream,
Beside a pure and living stream.

ExERcIsEs.—§What is said of the swan’s dying song? What
is the truth about it? Who was Swartz? Relate what is said of

_ Swartz.

And draw it from this broken icell,
On ‘golden wings to ' range ;

When God shall give him wings,
Above this dying world to ﬂee,
And live with +heavenly things.’

10. Our life is like a summer’s day,

We meet old age without dismay,
And death is sweet at last.

THE STOLEN CHILD AND THE GYPSIES.

1. +GYPSIEs are a class of people who have no set-
tled place to live in, but +Wander about from spot to
spot, and sleep at night in tents or in barns. We have
no gypsies in our country,* for here every person can

ﬁnd ‘employment of some kind, and there is no excuse

for idlers and vagrants. ,
2. But in many parts of Europe the gypsies are

very ”“numerous; and they are often wicked and ‘

+troublesome. It is said that they are descendants of
the Egyptians,* and have lived a wandering life ever
since the year 1517, at which time they refused to
submit to the Turks, who Were‘ the conquerors of

Egypt «
3. Well; I have a short story to tell you about

it these gypsies. Many years ago, as a boat was putting

off, a boy ran along the side of the canal, and desired
to be taken in. The master of the boat, however, re-
fused to take him, because he had not quite money
enough to pay the usual fare. ,

95* Gypsies are said to have come it originally from India. They
entered Europe in" the 14th or 15th century, and are now scattered

over Turkey, Russia, Hungary, Spain, England, etc. They live by A

theft, fortune-telling, horse-jockeying, tinkering, and the like.
Thereare a very few gypsies in this country.

4. A rich merchant being pleased with the looks of
the boy, whom I shall call Albert, and being touched
with “compassion toward him, paid the money for
him, and ‘ordered him to be taken on board. The
little fellow thanked the merchant for his kindness,
and jumped into the boat.

5. Upon talking‘ with him afterward, the merchant

A it found that Albert could readily speak in three or four
different ‘‘languages. He also learned that the'boy

had been stolen away, when a child, by a gypsy, and

had +rambled ever since, with a gang of these +strollers,

up and down several parts of Europe.

6. It .‘‘happened that the merchant, whose heart
seems to have inclined toward the boy‘ by a secret
kind of attraction, had himself lost a child some years _
before. The parents, after a long search for "him, had
‘‘concluded that he had ‘been ‘‘drowned’ in one of the
canals, with which the country abounds; and the
mother was so afflicted at the loss of her son, that
she died of grief for him.

7. Upon “lcomparing all the facts, and "“examining
the marks by which the child was described when he
was ﬁrst missing, Albert proved to be the long-lost
son of the merchant. The lad was well pleased to
ﬁnd a father who was so kind and '*generous; while
the father was not a little delighted to see a son return
to him, whom he had given up for lost.

8. Albert "possessed a quick +understanding, and in
time he rose to eminence, and was much ‘respected

. for his talents and ‘knowledge. He is said to have

visited, as a public minister, several countries, in which
he formerly wandered as a gypsy.

E XE RC IS E s.—What is this lesson about? What are gypsies?
Have we gypsies? What feelings did the merchant have toward‘
little Albert? Whom did he..prove to be? To whom should they
have’7been grateful for being thus brought together?

Was king of Macedon, one of the states of Greece.

His life was spent in war. He first conquered the .
other Grecian states, and then Persia, and India, and ,

other ’'countries one by one, till the Whole known
world was conquered by him.

2. It is said that he wept, because there were no

Was he so large that he could stand
Like some tall steeple high;

And while his feet were on the ground,  

His hands could touch the sky?

As I or uncle James. I

’T was not his stature made him great,
But greatness of his name.

His name so great? I know ’t is long,
But easy quite to spell;

And more than half a year ago,
I knew it very well.

I mean, my child, his Motions were
So great, he got a name,

That every body speaks with praise,
That tells about his fame.

Well, what great actions-did he do?
I want to know it all.

Why, he it was that +conquered‘ Tyre,
And leveled down her wall,

And thousands of her people slew;
And then to Persia went,  

And ﬁre and sword, on every side,’
Through many a region sent.

A hundred conquered icities shone
With midnight burnings red;

And strewed o’er many a battle ground, ‘

A thousand soldiers bled.

Did killing people make him great‘!
Then why was Abdel Young,

Who killed his neighbor, training-day,
Put, into jail and hung?

I never heard them call ‘him great.

Why, no, ’t was not in War;
And him that kills a single man,
Hisineighbors all abhor.

Well, then, if I should kill a man.
I’d kill a hundred more;

I should be GREAT, and not get hung,
Like Abdel Young, before.

Not so, my child, ’t will never do:
The G*:»spel bids be kind.

Then they that kill and they that praise,
The Gospel do not mind.

You know, my child, the Bible says
That you must always do

To other people, as you Wish
To have them do to you.

But, Pa’, did Alexander Wish
That some strong man would come,

And burn his house, and kill him, too,
And do as he had done’?

And every bodycalls him GREAT,
For killing people so‘!

Well, now, What right he had to kill,
I should be glad to know‘.

If one should burn the ”*buildings here,‘
And kill the folks Within’,

Would any body call him great’,
For such a Wicked thing’?

1. To act With integrity and good faith, was such a
habit With Susan, that she had never before thought
of examining the golden rule: “all things iwhatsoever
ye Would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
them‘.” But the longer she reﬂected upon it, the
stronger was her conviction, that she did not always
obey the precept; at length, she appealed’ to her
mother for its meaning. a

2. “It *implies,” said her mother, “in the ﬁrst
place’, a ‘‘total ‘destruction of all +selﬁshness‘; for a

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 119

man Who ‘loves himself better than his ‘neighbors’,
can never do to others as he would have others do to
him‘. We are bound not only to do’, but to feel‘
toward others, as We Would have others feel toward us.
‘Remember, it is much ‘easier to reprove the sin of
others, than to ‘overcome temptation when it assails
ourselves.

3. “A man may be perfectly honest, and yet very
selﬁsh; but the ‘command .implies ‘something more
than mere ‘honesty; it ‘requires charity as Well as
integrity. The meaning of the command is fully ex-
plained in the ‘parable of the Good ‘Samaritan. The
‘Levite, Who passed by the Wounded man Without
offering him ‘assistance, may have been a man of
great honesty; but he did not do unto the poor
‘stranger as he would have Wished others to do unto
him.” "A o

4. It was not long after this ‘conversation, that an

‘opportunity ‘occurred of trying Susan’ s principles.
One Saturday evening, when she Went, as usual, to
farmer Thompson’s’ inn, to ‘receive the price of her
mother’s Washing for the boarders, Which ‘amounted
to ‘ﬁve dollars, she found the farmer in the stable-
yard. . .
. 5. He Was ‘apparently in a ‘terrible rage with some
horse-dealers, with whom he had been ‘bargaining.
He held in his hand an open pocket-book, full of bills;
and ‘scarcely ‘noticing the child as she made her re-
quest, except to svvaar at her, as usual, for ‘troubling
him When he was busy, he handed her a bank-note.

6. Glad to ‘escape so easily, Susan ‘hurried out of
the gate, and then," pausing to pin the money safely in
the folds of her shawl, she ‘discovered that he had
given her two bills, instead of one. She‘ looked
around; nobody Was near to share her discovery; and
her ﬁrst ‘impulse was joy at the ‘unexpected prize.

120 NEW’FOUR'.I_‘H READER.

7. “It is mine, all amine,” said she to herself; “I
will buy mother a new "cloak with it, and she can give

her old one to sister Mary, and then Mary can go i
  to the Sunday-school with me next winter. I wonder

if it will not buy a pair of shoes for brother Tom,
too.”

8. At that moment she remembered that he must
have given it to her by mistake; and therefore she
had no right to it. But again the voice of the ‘ltempter
whispered, “He gave it, and how do you know that he
did not intend to make you a present of it? Keep it;
he will never know it, even -if it should be a mistake;
for he had too many such bills in that great pocket-
book, to miss one,” i T
" 9. While this conflict was going on in her mind
between good and evil, she was ‘hurrying "lhomeward
as fast as possible. Yet, before she came in sight of
her home, she had +repeatedly balanced the comforts,
which the money would ‘‘buy, against the sin of
'*wronging her *neighbor.

10. As she crossed the little’ bridge, over the narrow
creek, before her mother’s door, her eye fell upon a
?'rustic seat, which they had "occupied during the con-
versation I have before inarrated. Instantly’ the words
of ‘‘Scripture, “Whatsoever ye would that men should
do to you, do ye even so to them,” sounded in her

‘“e*a1°s like ‘a ‘trumpet.
11. Turning “lsuddenly round, .as if ﬂying from some .

unseen peril, the child +hastened along the road with
ibreathless" speed, ‘until she found herself, once more,
at farmer Thompson’s gate. “What do you want’
now?” asked the gruff old fellow, as he saw her again
at his side.

12.; “Sir, you paid me two bills, instead of one,”
said she, ltrembling ‘in every limb. “Two bills? did

out? Why did you not bring it back sooner?” Susan
blushed and hung her head.

13. “You wanted to keep it, I suppose,” said he.
“Well, I am glad your mother was more honest than
you, or I should have been ﬁve dollars poorer, and
none the wiser.” “My mother knows nothing about
it, sir,” said Susan; “I brought it back before I went
home.”

r 14. The old man looked at the child, and as he saw
the tears rolling down her cheeks, he seemed touched
by her distress. Putting his hand in his pocket, he

‘I drew out a shilling, and offered it to her.

15. “No, sir, I thank you,” +sobbed she; “I do not
Want to be paid for doing right; I only wish you
would not think me dishonest, for, indeed, it was a sore

temptation. O! sir, if you had ever seen those you '

love best, wanting the common comforts‘ of life, you
would know how hard it ‘is for us always to do unto
others as we’ would have others do unto us.”

16. The heart of the selﬁsh man was touched.
“There be things which are little upon the earth, but
they are +exceeolz'ng wise,” +murmured he, as he bade
the little girl good—night, and entered his house a
sadder, and, it is to be hoped, a better man. Susan
returned to her humble home with a +1ightened heart,
and through the course of a long and useful life, she
never forgot her ﬁrst temptation.

1. “I WILL have revenge on him, that I Will, and
make him +heartily repent it,” said Philip to himself,
with a '*countenance quite red With/anger. His mind
Was so ‘engaged, that he did not see Stephen, Who
"‘happened at that instant to ‘meet him. 2

2. “Who is that,” said Stephen, “on whom you
intend to be revenged?” Philip, as if ‘fawalgened
from a dream, ‘stopped short, and looking at his
friend, soon resumed a smile that was natural to his
countenance. “Ah,” said he, “you ‘‘remember my
supple-jack, a very pretty cane which Was given me
by my father, do you not? Look! there it is in
pieces. It Was farmer +Robinson’s son, who reduced
it to this Hvorthless state.”

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. .123

3. Stephen very +coolly asked him, what had induced
young Robinson to break it. “I Was walking +peace-
ably along,” replied he, “and was playing with my
cane by twisting it round my body. By accident, one

of the ends ‘‘slipped out of my hand,‘ when I Was’

opposite the gate, just by the Wooden bridge, where
the ill-natured fellow had put down a *pitcher of
water, which he was taking home from the well.

4. “It so happened that my cane, in’ springing
back, upset the pitcher, but did not break it. He
came up close to me, and began to call me names,

when I ”assured him, that what I had done had hap- '
ipened by accident, and that I was sorry for it. With-

out ’“regarding What I said, he instantly seized my
cane, and ‘twisted it, as you see; but I will make
him repent of it.”   y

5. “ To be sure,” said Stephen, “he is a very
wicked boy, and is already‘ very properly punished for
being such, since nobody likes him, or will have any
thing to do with him. He can scarcely ﬁnd a ‘‘com-
panion to play with him; and is often at a loss for

'*amusement, as he deserves to be. This, properly 

considered, I think will appear +sufﬁcient revenge for
you.” '

6. “ All this is true,” replied Philip, “but he has «
broken my cane. It was a present from my father, .
and a very pretty cane it was. I offered to ﬁll his

pitcher for him again, as I '*knocked ittdown by acci-
dent. I will be revenged.”

7. “Now, Philip,” said Stephen, “I think you will
act better in not minding him, as your contempt will
be the best “punishment you can inﬂict upon him. Be
assured, he will always be able to do more ‘mischief to

you than you ‘choose to do to him. And, now I think

of it, I will tell you what happenedto him not long
since-

8. “Very +unluckily for him, he chanced to see a
bee hovering about a ﬂower, which he ’“caught, and
was going to pull off its wings out of sport, when the
animal stung him, and ﬂew away in safety to the hive.
The pain put him into a ‘furious +passion, and, like
you, he vowed revenge. He laccordingly ““procured a
stick, and thrust it into the bee-hive.

9. “In an instant, the whole swarm ﬂew out, and

+alighting upon him, stung him in a hundred ”‘different‘

places. He ‘‘uttered the most +piercing cries, and
rolled upon the ground in the excess of his agony.
His father ﬁmmediately ran to him, but could not
put the bees to ’“flight, until they had stung him so

. fseverely, that he was +conﬁned several days to his

bed. ,

10. “Thus, you see, he was not very ‘“successful in
his pursuit of revenge. I would advise you, therefore,
to pass over his insult. He is a wicked boy, and
much stronger than you; so that your abilityto obtain
this revenge may be doubtful.”

11. “I must own,” replied Philip, “that your advice
seems very good. So come along with me, and I
will tell my father the whole matter, and I think he
will not be angry with me.” They went, and Philip

told his father what had happened. He thanked T

Stephen for the good advice he had given his son,

and gave Philip another cane, exactly like the
‘ iﬁrst. _, y
12. A few days afterward, Philip saw this ill—natured_

boy fall, as he was carrying home a heavy log ‘of
wood, which he could not lift up again. Philip ran to
him, and helped him to replace it on his shoulder.
Young Robinson was quite ashamed at the thought of

this unmerited kindness, and heartily repented of his

”‘behavior. Philip went home quite +satisﬁ<,-d. “This,”

said he, “is the noblest vengeance I could take, in

1. .MY DEAR AUNT:-—-I take the opportunity of
sending a letter by Mr. Green, to let you see *whether
I am improved in my writing, as I wrote you about
this time last year; and to tell you that I hope you
will come to see us soon, as I have so many things to
shew you. I have been to see a real play since I
saw you; I never ‘laughed so much in all my life-; it
was so curious to see so many people all in tears, one
above another! a

such a bad gait; it always will be so till he can mend
it. It is so long since we have seen our cousins, that
we are afraid they are ill: papa means to send George,
to—morrow, to sea. It is so warm, that I am writing
out of doors, close by the beach, with a large plain
before me; George has just got a nice plaice, as well
as myself; I am very bizzy making nets, as we are
going to have a sail to-morrow; I wish you were here.

4. It is my birthday; papa has brought me down a
beau; he says I am now quite old enough to have a
beau, as I can be trusted; and I am to have my hair
dressed to-day. I have had several presents, and one
is the nicest little deer in the world; I long to buy a
ﬁne cage for it. .

5. I am very much.'*obliged to you for the globes
you were kind enough to promise me. William gave
me a small pair, to-day; he has been learning to shoot
with a gun, and he was near laming himself for life,
for he stuffed his toe in so tight, he could not get it

  out, and papa wasafraid the gun would burst. George

rowed over to uncle J ohn’s yesterday, and he gave
him two new oars to bring home, which he gave me
for a birthday present, and I have put them into my
little cedar;-wood box, in my Indian cabinet.

6. I have found such a pretty vale lately. I long
to show it to you; it is exactly like a French vale.

From your ‘affectionate +Niece.

has not seen my letter, she told me how to spell all
the long, hard words. I must leave off; what a trouble
these aunts are! I can not get rid of them.

LETTER II.—Mrs. Wilson to her Niece. ).
1. MY DEAR NIECE:—Your letter surprised me
“exceedingly, as it conveyed much information for

— THE EC-LECTIC SERIES. 129

which I was not in the least prepared. Your being at
the seaside, will deter me from visiting your mamma at
present, as I am not able to take so long a journey;
and as you are anxious to “ get rid of your aunts,”
(which I really believe you had no intention of writing
down in your letter), I will not “trouble” you with my
company; but will visit your mamma when you are
from home.

2. I do not +imagine I should like your garden very
much, as I think that thyme is very fit for a kitchen
garden. I do not remember that I ever admired your
old ewe; I used to prefer your little lambs; and I never
knew before that lightning injured furs: I thought that
moths were their only tenemies. I can not agree with
your papa, that you require a beau; surely your kind

brothers, who are older than éyourself, can / walk out .

with you, and take care of you. .\

3. I can not guess why William should stuﬂ' his toe
into the barrel of his gun; ’t is more like the act of
an idiot than of a sensible boy like him; but I am

still more puzzled to know how George could row all’

the way to his uncle’s, as there is no water within
some miles of Otley Park; nor how you can get a
pair of oars into your little India cabinet.

4. I shall be glad to see the pretty valley you have
discovered, but as you have never been in France,
how do you know it is like a French vale? I am truly
sorry your father has decided on sending George to
sea, as his original plan, of sending him to study for
the Church, seemed so congenial to his mind and
character.

5. I am surprised that your mamma should think it
right to have your hair dressed, as your own natural
curls are far better than curls made with hot irons.

I think that the little deer that has been given you, I

would be much happier in your uncle’s park than in

manner as to destroy his own garden Walks. I do not

was so +aﬁ'ecting as to excite every one to tears, you
must have appeared very silly to be laughing all the

To TEACHERS.——It is an excellent plan for the teacher to re-
quire each member of the class to write upon a slate, or paper, such
Words as he may give out from the Reading Lesson, directing a
mutual exchange of slates for correction-. This impressesupon the
mind the appearance as Well as the sound of words, and will form
a useful auxiliary to the Spelling-book; though there can be no
substitute for that indispensable drill.

LETTER III.—Mrs. Walford to Mrs. Wilson.

THE GLEBE: Sr. ALBANS.

1. EMMA has been in despair, my dear sister, ever
since the receipt of your letter; she begs me, as ‘soon
as possible, to clear up the mistakes Which, in her
extreme ignorance, she has *committed. In the ﬁrst
place, she is very anxious that I should tell you how
much she loves all her +aunts, and you the most of all.

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 131

2. Had you not returned Emma’s letter, your answer
Would not have been understood. The boys have been
much amused, and have, to use their own expression,

« “quizzed her most +unmercifully;” but, at the least

hint from me, I know they will +desist.

3. Naturally ambitious, and a little vain, Emma has
always "considered English spelling as a tiresome task;
there was no praise, no honor, no glory, in fspelling
well; it was a matter of course, and though it was a
“disgrace to spell ill, it was no merit to spell well.

4. She now feels the importance of it; and as soon
as I see that she is diligent in learning the “long,
dull column of spelling,” the subject of the unfortunate
letter shall be dropped.

5. She begs me to tell you, that when the weather
is ﬁne, I allow her a great portion of +t2'me to work in
her garden; that your favorite +ye/w-tree is dead; and
that our lﬁzrs were destroyed in the last storm; that
her papa brought her down a +5071) and arrows; that
William *‘stuﬁ'ed too much How into his gun; that he
‘Wade over to ‘Otley Park on his ‘fpony, and brought
back two pretty ‘specimens of +copper are, which he
kindly gave to her to put among her curiosities.

6. She found a Weil in the road the other day,
Which, on '*comparing with mine, she pronounces to
be a French veil. George went to see his cousins;
their absence was "occasioned by their having some
friends staying with them.

7. Philip Ainsworth sent us a "ham; as it was near
Emma/’s birthday, he‘ begged it might be aipresent to
her; Emma’s “little deer” is a canary; all her pets are
+0lear in her eyes; she thought she had a nice "place
under the +beec/2 on a bank, but as she was *troubled
with the mnts, she was obliged to leave it; she has
been making nets to cover pictures for a sale in the
neighborhood, for some +charity.

appeared quite docile, till they attempted to ‘harness

ascend it. But on he went, jumping from one height
to another, like a gazelle.

4. As soon as he had +disappeared over the summit,
the lady desired the plowman to get ready, and start
for the other side of the hill, and endeavor to learn
something of the runaway. He did so, but had to
make a circuit of nine miles before he reached the
part of the hill on the other side, where he thought it
likely the animal had passed down. . ~

5. In vain, however, he inquired at every house he
came to, and of every one he met. N 0 one had seen
the horse. Night came on, and the plowman had to

seek “'shelter for himself, very sad at hearing no news

from the runaway. The next morning he ‘renewed his
. search, but, for some time, in vain.

6. However, as he came near the lake of Monteith,
his ’*attention was iattracted by the “joyful, hmirthful
shouts of some children in the barn-yard of a very
humble cottage which he was passing.

7. He leaned over the wall, and to his great wonder,
saw the object of his search‘———the very horse‘, sur-
rounded by a group of half-clad little *Highlanders,
of all ages, from three years to fourteen‘; each of
whom was trying to see, who should show most marks

of childish love toward the animal. The horse, gentle

as a lamb’, ﬂicked them, and ifondled them with his
head, like an aﬂectionate dog.

THE WAY TO BE HAPPY.

REMARK.-In reading, be careful to avoid holding your book
directly in front of your face, for this obstructs the free passage of

the voice.
I

PRONOUNCE correctly. Do not say unpopilarl for un-pop-u-lar;
sac-ri-ﬁs-es nor sa-cri;ﬁs—es for sac-ri—ﬁ-ces; misforten for mis—fort-
une; yer for your, as, all in your power, not, all in yer power.

1. EVERY child must observe, how much more‘ happy
and beloved some children are thanothers. There are
some children you always love to be With. They are
happy themselves, and they make you happy.

2. There are others, Whom you always avoid. They
seem to have no friends. No’ person can be happy
Without friends. The heart is formed for 1ove,2.nd can
not be happy Without it.

3- “’Tis not in titles nor in rank, _

’T is not in wealth like London bank’,
To make us truly blest‘.

If happiness have not her seat
And center in the breast‘,

We may be wise, or rich, or great’,
But never can be blest‘.”

138 NEW FOURTH READER.

4. Butyou can not receive affection, unless you will
also give it. You can not ﬁnd others to love you,
unless you will also love them. Love is only to be
+obtained by giving love in return. Hence the "tim-
portance of cultivating a good +disposition. You can
not be happy without it.

5. I have sometimes heard a girl say, “I know that
I am very unpopular at school.” Now, this plainly
shows that she is not amiable.

6. If your companions do not love you, it is your
own fault. They can not help loving you, if you will
be kind and friendly. If you are not loved, it is a good
proof that you do not ‘‘deserve to be loved. It is true,
that a sense of duty may, at times, render it "‘neces-
sary for you to do that which will displease your com-
panions. Y

7. But if it is seen that you have a noble spirit; that
you are above +selﬁshness ; . that you are willing to make
"sacriﬁces to promote the happiness of others, you will
never be in want of friends. p

8. You must not regard it as your mz'sf0rtzme, that

others do not love you, but your fault. It is, not

ibeauty, it is not "wealth that will give‘ you friends.
Your heart must_ glow with kindness, if you would
'*attract to yourself the esteem and affection of those

. around you.

9. You are little aware how much the happiness of

your whole life. ’"depends upon the cultivation of a.

good disposition. If you will adopt the ‘resolution,
that you will '*confer ""f-avors whenever you can, you
will certainly be surrounded by ardent friends. Begin
upon this "principle in +childhood, and act upon it
through life, and you will make yourself t happy, and
promote the happiness of all within your inﬂuence.

10. You go to school on a cold, winter morning. A

bright ﬁre is *blazing upon the hearth, surrounded with

THE ECLECTIC snnms. 139

boys struggling to get near it to warm themselves.
After you are slightly warmed, a +school-mate comes
in, suffering with cold. “Here, James,’.’ you pleasantly
call out to him, “I am almost warm; you may have my
place.”   H

11. As you slip aside to allow him to take your place
at the fire, will  not feel that you are kind? The
worst boy in the world can not help +admiring such
generosity. And even though he be so ungrateful as
not to return the favor, you may depend upon it, that
he will be your_ friend, as far as he is capable of friend-
ship. If you will always act upon this principle, you
will never want for friends. 1 .  

12. Suppose, some day, you were out with your +com~
panions playing ball. After you had been playing for
some time, another boy comes along. He can not be
"chosen upon ““either side, for there is no one to match
him. “Henry,” you say,“ you may take my place a
little while, and I will rest.” ~ -

13. You throw yourself down upon the grass, while
Henry, fresh and ”*vigorous, takes your bat and ’“en-
gagesin the game. He knows that you gave up to
oblige him; and how can he help liking you for it?
The fact is, that neither man nor child can cultivate
such a spirit of generosity and kindness without attract-
ing affection and esteem.

14. Look and see which of your companions have the

most friends, and you will ﬁnd that they are those who  

have this noble spirit; who are willing to deny them-
selves, that they may make others’ happy. There is
but one ‘way to make friends; and that is, by_being
friendly to others.

15. Perhaps some child who reads this, feels +con-
scious of being disliked, and yet desires to have the
aﬁection of his companions. You ask me what you

shall do. I will tell you. I will give you an infallible

rule :——Do all in your power to make others happy. Be
willing to make sacriﬁces, that you may promote the
happiness of others.

16. This is the way to make friends, and the only
way. When you are playing with your brothers and
sisters at home, be always ready to give them more

” than their share of ’’privileges.' Manifest an obliging

disposition, and they can not but regard you with

affection. In all your intercourse with others, at home if

or abroad, let these feelings "inﬂuence you,and you
will receive a rich reward.

5. “O, if the walking of a ﬂy or +mosquito is at all
connected with philosophy, I assure you I shall want
to know nothing about it, for I hate philosophy, it is
such dry stuif.”

6. “Papa, never mind my sister,” said William.
“James and I want very much to understand, and
Harriet need not stay to hear the explanation, if she
does notwish to.” .

7. “Well, my boys, come to the library. I have just
+arranged my lsolar microscope, to show you the foot
and the leg of a ﬂy, andsome other curious things. I
have likewise my air-pump ready, which will help to
explain what you want to know.”

8. Harriet looked a little disappointed, and wished
that she had not spoken so +decidedly against philoso-
phy, for she was very fond of seeing, and only "dis-
liked the labor of +studying. Her papa, observing the
+moody +expression’of her ““lively “lcountenance, said,
“I wish you, ‘William, to try and ‘‘persuade your sister
to overcome so much of her dislike to philosophy, for
the present, as to go with us to the library.” William
had no difficult task to perform, and in a minute they
Were all seated in the library, eager to ‘hear all that

moving the ’"handle of the air-pump. You ’'perceive
that this glass vessel, which is put on this brass plate,
now sticks so ﬁrmly to it, that I am unable to force it
away.”

as ‘fast to the plate, as the friend of Hercules that I
read about the other day,- was to the stone on which he
sat, in the regions of Pluto.”

11. “How is this done, father? It looks like some

12. “Though you can not see it, I assure you there
is something pressing very hard all around it, and that
is the air.” I

13. “You astonish me. Has the air weight? I.
never heard of that before. I shall never say again,i,
‘as light as air.’ ”

14. “But you have heard of hurricanes sweeping
away ’'forests and houses, and +rendering the ”“countries
over which they passed, a wilderness; and, in truth,

they are almost as much to be idreaded as +earthquakes, .

and a hurricane is only air put in motion.”

15. “I have been very stupid not to ﬁnd out that air
has +weight. But how is it that we do not feel it,
papa?” “ To be sure,” continued Harriet, “if it is so
heavy it would pin us to the earth, and then we should

its way into every crevice; and one of its "“properties
is, that it presses ““equally in all '*directions; up, and
down, and sideways, with equal force. We only per-
ceive its weight, when we remove the air from one side

of a body, so as to cause the whole weight to be upon .

the other.

was in the inside of it, and which pressed it upward
with a force exactly equal to that with which the air
above pressed downward, and then the whole weight of
the airpressing in one direction, kept it ﬁrmly ‘attached
to the brass plate.” ‘ ,

18. “How beautiful,” cried William, “I shall never
breathe the air again without thinking of this.”

19. “I will take off this vessel and put this one on, T

which is open at both ends. Now put your hand,
Harriet, on the upper end, and I will cause a slight
‘Vacuum to take place, so that you may feel the press-
ure.”

20. “Stop, father, you will crush my hand to pieces,
if you move that handle another time. Do look at my
hand, William; the +gripe of a ‘‘giant would be nothing
to that.”  

21. William tried the experiment himself. “I-Iow
+heavy is the air, papa? I should like to know that.”

22. “It is very heavy. It presses upon the surface
of all ‘bodies near the level of the “‘ocean, with a force
equal to ﬁfteen pounds on every square inch.

23. “But I will perform another experiment, showing
the pressure of the air. I place this glass vessel, which
is open at both ends, on the plate of the air—pump; on
the top of it I place the piece of glass, Which is so
closely ﬁtted as to exclude the air. I now withdraw
the air from under it.”

24. “What a crash, father,” exclaimed William and

Harriet‘ at the same instant, as the glass Was ishivered

to pieces by the weight of the air. /

u 25. “I think you can now understand that if a ﬂyi

has the power to extract the air fromyhis feet as he
moves along, the pressure of the air is enough to hold

him fast to any +surface, however +smooth.”

26. “If the ﬂy can do that, he is more of a philoso-
pher than I took him to be,” said William. “But I am
anxious to see how the little fellow does it.” 1

27. “Here is the leg of a common ﬂy, that I have
placed in the microscope, which I bring to the proper
focus. It is now so much magniﬁed, that we can ex-
amine its various parts with ease.”

28. “What a strange looking thing it is, and so
large! my arm is nothing to it. How I should like to

' see an ‘elephant put into a microscope.”

THEHECLECTIC SERIES. 145

29. “What an idea, Harriet! Why, it would appear
as large as one of the Alps,” exclaimed William.

30. “We only use microscopes to examine bodies
that are too +delicate for the eye. But you Will ob-
serve that the leg is +holloW, for there is a line of light
‘running up the middle of it. At the foot, you can
‘distinctly "observe a kind of ﬂap, to Which are +at-

tached two points, one in front, and the other behind.

By moving these, the ﬂy can extend or ‘“contract the
ﬂap just as he pleases.

31. “When Mr. Fly, then, wishes to pay a visit to a
"distinguished ‘acquaintance, or to move with dignity,
Without the trouble of raising himself in the air, he
“stretches out these points, +tightenS the ﬂap, draws
the air from under it, and moves along the polished
surface of the glass, with as much ease and ’‘Security

as you can on the broad +gravel-Walk in the garden.” , r

geniousl” they all exclaimed at once. “I shall never
see a ﬂy again Without “interest.”

periment does the ﬂy perform with his .foot? What is philosophy?

1. MANY young persons seem to think it of not much
consequence if they do not "improve their time Well in
youth, vainly ‘expecting thatthey can make it up -by
‘tdiligence when they are older. They also think it is
disgraceful for men and women to be idle, but that there
can be no harm for persons Who are young, to spend
their time in any manner they please. “ e _

2. George Jones thought so. When he Was twelve

tyearsold, he Went to an academy to prepare to enter

college. His father Was at great ‘expense in "obtain- .

ing books for him, +clothing him, and ’'paying his
+tuition. i But George was idle. .The preceptor ofthe
academy Would often tell him, that if he did not study
diligently when young, he would never +succ.eed Well.

150 NEW FOURTH READER.

3. But George thought of nothing but present '*pleas-
ure. He would often go to school Without having made
any preparation for his morning lesson; and, when
called to '*recite with his class, he would +stammer and

~make such *blunders, that the rest of the class could

not help laughing at him. He was one of the poorest
"scholars in the school, because he Was one of the most
idle.

4. When +recess came, and all the boys ran out of
the academy upon the play-ground, idle George Would
come "moping along. Instead of studying diligently
While in school, he Was indolent and half asleep.
When the proper time for play came, he had no relish
for it. I recollect very Well, that, When "tossz'n.g up for
a game of ball, We used to choose every body on the
play-ground, before We chose George. And if there
Were *enough Without him, We used to leave him out.
Thus was he unhappy in school, and out of school.

5. There is nothing which makes a person enjoy
play so Well, as to study hard. When recess was over,
and the rest of the boys frreturned, ‘fresh and vigorous,
to their studies, George might be seen ﬂagging and
moping along to his seat. Sometimes he would be
asleep in school; sometimes he would pass his time in
"catching “"ﬂies, and "tpenning them up in little holes,
which he cutein his seat. And sometimes, when the

G preceptor’s back was turned, he Would throw a paper
‘ ball across the room.

6. When the class was called up to recite, George
would come +droWsily along, looking as *mean and
“ashamed as though ‘he were going to be "whipped.
The rest of the class *stepped up to the recitation with
alacrity, and appeared happy and contented. When it

came George’s turn to recite, he Would be so long in‘

doing it, and make such blunders, that all most heartily
wished him out of the class.

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 151

7. At last, George went with his class to enter col-
lege. Though he passed a very poor ”'examination, he
was *admitted with the rest; for those who examined
him thought it was ‘‘possible, that the reason why he
did not ‘‘answer “questions better, was because he was
"frightened. Now camehard times for poor George.
In college there is not much mercy shown to bad
scholars; and George had Tneglected his studies so
long, that he could not now keep up with his class, let
him try ever so hard. _’

8. He could, without much +diﬁiculty, get along in
the academy, where there were only two or three boys
of his own class to laugh at him. ‘But now he had to
go into a large ’*recitation room, ﬁlled with students
from all parts of the country. In the presence of all
these, he must rise and recite to a professor. Poor
fellow! He paid dearly for his idleness.

9. You would have pitied him, if you could have
seen him trembling in his seat, every moment expect-
ing to be called upon to recite. And when he was
called upon, he would stand up, and take what the class
called a dead set; that is, he could not recite at all.
Sometimes he would make such ludicrous blunders,

that the whole class would burst into a laugh. Such a

are the applauses an idler gets. He was "wretched, of
course. He had been idle so long, that he hardly
knew how to apply his mind to study. All the good
scholars avoided him; they were ashamed to be seen in
his company. He became "discouraged, and gradually
grew dissipated. A ,

10. The ofﬁcers of the college were soon ‘*compelled
to suspend him. He returned in a few months, but did
no better; and his father was then advised to take him

  from college. He left college, despised by every one.

A. few months ago, I met him, a poor "wanderer, with-
out money and without friends. Such are the wages

1. I GAVE you, in the last lesson, the history of
George Jones, an idle boy, and showed you the ‘icon-
sequences of his idleness. I shall now give you the
history of Charles -Bullard, a classmate of George.
Charles was about the same age as George, and did not
possess +superior talents. Indeed, I doubt whether he
was equal to him, in natural powers of mind. .

2. But Charles was a hard student. When quit
young, he was always careful and diligent in school.
Sometimes, when there was a very hard lesson, instead
of going out to play during recess, he would stay in to
study. He had resolved that his ﬁrst object should

‘i54 NEW FOURTH RE-ADER.i

be to get his lessons well, and then he could play with
a. good conscience. He loved play as well as any body,
and was one of the best players on the ground. I
hardly ever saw any boy catch a ball better than he
could. When playing any game, every one was glad
to get Charles on his side.

3. I have said, that Charles would sometimes stay
in at recess. This, however, was very seldom; it was
only when the lessons were very hard indeed. Gen-
erally, he was among the ﬁrst on the play-ground,
and he was also among the ﬁrstto go into school, when
called. Hard study gave him a relish for play, and
play again gave him a relish for hard study; so he
was happy both in school and out. The "preceptor
could not help liking him, for he always had his lessons
well ’"committed, and never gave him any trouble.

4. When he went to enter college, the preceptor
gave him a good recommendation. He was able to
answer all the questions, which were put to him when
he was "examined. He had studied so well, when he
was in the *‘academy, and was so ~’*thoroughly prepared
for college, that he found it very easy to keep up with
his class, and had much time for reading interesting
books.

5. But ne would always get his lesson well, before
he did any thing else, and would review it just before
‘lrecitation. When called upon to recite, he rose tran-
quil and happy, and very seldom made mistakes. The
oﬂicers of the college had a high opinion of him, and
he was respected by all the students.

’ L6. There was, in the college, a society made up of
all the best scholars. Charles was chosen a member
of that society. a It was the custom to choose some one
of the society, to deliver a public address every, year.
This honor was conferred on Charles; and he had

i studied so diligently, and read so much, that he deliv-

THE ECLECTIC SERIES; 155

ered an address which was very interesting to all who
heard it. .

7. At last he graduated, as it is called; that is, he
ﬁnished his collegiate course, and received his degree.
It was known by all that he was a good scholar, and
by all thathe was respected. His fatherand mother,
brothers and sisters came, on the commencement day,
to hear him speak.

8. They all felt gratiﬁed, and loved Charles more
than ever. Many ‘‘situations of usefulness and proﬁt
were opened to him; for Charles was now an intelli-

gent man, and universally respected. He is still a

useful and a happy man. He has a cheerful home,
and is esteemed by all who know him.

9. Such are the rewards of industry. How strange
it is, that any person should be willing to live in idle-
ness, when it will certainly make him unhappy! The
idle boy is almost *invariably poor and ,. +miserable;
the ‘iindustrious boy is happy and +prosper‘ous.

10. But perhaps some child who reads this, asks,
“Does God notice little children in school?” He
certainly does. And if you are not diligent in the
improvement of your time, it is one of the surest evi-
dences that your heart is not right with God. You are
placed in this world to improve your time. In youth,
you must be preparing for future usefulness. And if
you do not improve the advantages you enjoy, you sin
against your Maker. '

With books, or work, or healthful play,
Let your ﬁrst years be past; ‘

That you may give, for every day,
Some. good account,‘ at last.

sky beyond the reach of the naked eye, and such is
his strength, that he has been known to carry away
children in his talons. But many of the noble "quali-
ties imputed to him, are rather fanciful than true.

2. He has been describedas showing alofty inde-
pendence, which makes him disdain to, feed on any

. thing that is not slain by his own strength. But Wil-

son says, that he has seen an eagle feasting on the
*carcass of a dead horse. It is, also, well known that
the bald-eagle “lprincipally lives by “robbing the ﬁsh-
hawk of his prey. The eagle lives to a great age.
One at Vienna, is stated to have died after a "conﬁne-
ment of one hundred and four years.

3. There are several ““species of the eagle. The
golden-eagle, which is one of the largest, is nearly four
feet from the point of the ’"beak to the end of the tail.
He is found in most parts of ‘’‘Europe, and is also met
with in ‘‘America. High rocks and ruined and lonely
towers, are the places which he chooses for his abode.
His nest is composed of sticks and rushes. The tail

feathers are highly valued as iornaments, by the.Amer-

ican Indians. ,

4. The most "interesting species is the ba1d—eagle,'

as this is an American bird, and the adopted ’'emblem

of our country. He lives chieﬂy upon ﬁsh, and is found

in the *neighborhood of the sea, and along the shores
and "cliffs of our large lakes and rivers.

5. According to the ‘description given by Wilson,
he depends, in procuring his food, +chieﬂy upon the

labors of others._ He watches the ﬁsh-hawk as he s

dives into the sea for his prey, and darting down upon
him as he rises, forces him to relinquish his victim,
anEd~-then seizes it before it again reaches the water.

6.’ The plate on the ‘preceding page, represents the
harpy-eagle. This is said to be bold and strong, and
to attack beasts‘, and even man himself. He is ﬁerce,

150 NEW FOURTH READER.

+quarrelsome, and +sullen, living alone in the deepest
forests. He is foundchieﬂy in South America.

ExEItcrsEs.—Why is the eagle considered superior to other
birds? Which species is the emblem of our country? How does
he obtain his food? What would this practice be called if adopted
among men? Have animals any knowledge of right or wrong?
Is there any man so ignorant as not to know something of right
and wrong ? ' ~

1. IN a distant ﬁeld, stood a large tulip-tree, *ap-
parently of a century’s growth, and one of the most

THE ECLECTIC SERIES; 161

gigantic. It looked like the father of the surrounding
forest. A single tree, of huge dimensions, standing all
alone, is a sublime object.

2. On the top of this tree, an old eagle, commonly
called the “Fishing-Eagle,” had built her nest every
year, for many years, and *undisturbed had raised her

a young. What is remarkable, as she procured her food

from the ocean, this tree stood full ten miles from the
sea-shore. It had long been known as the “Old Eagle-
Tree.”

3. On a warm, sunny day, the workmen were +hoe-
ing cornin an adjoining ﬁeld. At a certain hour of
the day, the old eagle was known to set oil‘ for the
sea.-side, to gather food for her young. As she this
day returned with a large ﬁsh in her claws, the work-

men surrounded the tree, and by ‘yelling and hooting, .

and throwing stones, so scared the poor bird, that she
dropped her ﬁsh, and they carried it off in triumph.

4. The men soon dispersed, but Joseph sat down "

under a bush near by, to watch, and to bestow un-
availing pity. The bird soon returned to her nest,
without food. The eaglets at once set up a cry for
food so shrill, so clear, and so clamorous, that the boy

was greatly moved. T #5

T 5. The parent-bird seemed to try to *soothe them;

but their ‘appetites were too keen, and it was all in -

vain. She then perched herself on a limb near them,
and looked down into the nest with a look that seemed
to say, “I know not what to do next.”

6. Her indecision was but momentary,” again she
+poised herself, uttered one or two sharp‘ notes, as if
telling them to “lie still,” +balanced her body, spread
her wings, and was away again for the sea!

7. Joseph was determined to see the result.’ His]
‘ eye followed her till she grew small, smaller, a mere

speck in the sky, and then disappeared. What boy;

has not thus Watched the ﬂight of the bird of his
country? I ,

8. She Was gone nearly two hours, about double her
usual time for a "voyage, when she again returned,
on a slow, Weary wing, ﬂying uncommonly low, in
order to have a ”’heavier atmosphere to sustain her,
with another ﬁsh in her talons.

9. On nearing the ﬁeld, she made a circuit round
it, to see if her enemies were again there. Finding
the coast clear, she once more reached the tree, droop-
ing, faint, and weary, and evidently nearly exhausted.
Again the eaglets set up their cry, which was soon
hushed by the distribution of a dinner, such as, save
the cooking, a king might admire.

10. “Glorious bird!” cried the boy, “What a spirit!”
Other birds can ﬂy more swiftly, others can sing more
sweetly, others scream more loudly; but what other
bird, when ‘persecuted and robbed, when Weary, when
discouraged, When so far from the sea, Would do this?

11. “Grloriousbird! I will learn a lesson from thee
to-day. I Will never forget, hereafter, that when the

 spirit is determined, it can do almost any thing. Others

would have drooped, and hung the head, and mourned
over the cruelty of man, and sighed over the wants
of the nestlings; but thou, by at once ’‘recovering the
loss, hast forgotten all. I

12. “I will learn of thee, noble bird! I will remem-
ber this. I will set my mark high. I will try to do
something, and to be something in the World; I will
never yield to ‘“discom°agements.”

1. FRANK’S father was speaking to a friend, one

rivals; “nor did my +winning many a prize from my

was present, ‘related an anecdote which had fallen
under his own ‘notice, in a school in his "neighbor-
hood.

‘'‘farmers, and others, who were poorer, +received *in-
struction. Frank +listened with great attention, while
the gentleman gave the following account of the two

5. It happened that the son of a rich farmer, and
of a poor widow, came in competition for the head

of their class. They were so nearly equal, that the
teacher could scarcely decide between them; some
days one, and some days the other, ‘gained the head
of the class. It was +determined, by seeing who should
be at the head of the class for the greater number of
days in the week. g .

6. The widow’s son, by the last day’s trial, gained
the victory, and kept his place the following week, till
the school was dismissed for the holidays.

7. When they met again, the widow’s son did not
appear, and the farmer’s son being next to him, might
now have been at the head of his class. Instead of
"seizing the vacant place, however, he went to the
widow’s house, to inquire what could be the cause of
her son’s +absence. W

8. ’“Poverty was the cause; she found that she was
not able, with her utmost +eﬁ'orts, to continue to pay
for his tuition and books, and the poor boy had re-
turned to labor for her support.

9. The farmer’s son, out of the “allowance of pocket-
money, which his father gave him, bought all the nec~
essary books, and paid for the tuition of his rival. He
also permitted him to be brought back again to the
head of his class,’where he continued for some time, at
the expense of his generous rival.

the juice out of it on the part whicheis stung. Well,
is the pain +leSSened?

A. O, Very.much indeed, I hardly feel it now. But
I wish there was not a nettle in the world. I am sure
I do not know what use there can be in them.

F. If you knew any thing of botany, Nanny, you
would not say So. 

A. What is botany, papa?

F. Botany, my dear, is the '*‘knowledge of plants.

a A. Some plants are very *beauti_ﬁ1l. If the lily were
growing in our ﬁelds, I shouldnot “"complain. But this
ugly nettlel I do not know what beauty or use there
can be in that.

168 NEW FOURTH READER.

F. And yet, Nanny, there is more beauty, use, and
instruction in a nettle, than even in a lily.

A. O papa, how can you make that out?

F. Put on your gloves, pluck up that nettle, and let
us examine it. First, look at the ﬂower.

A. The ﬂower, papa? I see no ﬂower, unless those
little, +ragged knobs are ﬂowers, which have neither
color nor smell, and are not much larger than the heads
of pins. .

F. Here, take this magnifying-glass and examine
them.

A. O, I see now; every little knob is folded up in
leaves, like a rose-bud. _ Perhaps there is a ﬂower
inside.

F. Try; take this pin and touch the knob. Well,
what do you see?

A. 0, how curious!

F. What is curious?

A. The moment I touched it, it ﬂew open. A little
cloud rose out like enchantment, and four beautiful
little stems sprung up as if they were alive; and now,
that I look again with the glass, I see’ an elegant little
ﬂower, as nice and perfect as a lily itself.

F. Well, now examine the leaves.

A. O, I see they are all covered over with little
"bristles; and when I examine them with the glass, I
see a little bag, ﬁlled with a ‘juice like water, at the
bottom of each. Ha! these are the things which stung
me.

F. Now touch the little bag with the point of the
pm.

A. When I press the bag, the juice runs up and
comes out at the small point at the top; so I suppose
the little thorn must be hollow inside, though it isﬁner
than the point of my *cambric needle.

F. Have all the leaves those stings?

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 169

A. No, papa; some of the young ones are quite
gmen and soft, like velvet, and I may handle them
without any danger.

17'. Now look at the stem, and break it.

A. I can easily crack it, but I can not break it
*asunder, for the bark is so strong that it holds it
together. '

F. Well, now you see there are more "curious things
in the nettle than you expected.

A. Yes, indeed, I see that. But you have often told

me that God makes nothing without its use; and I am

sure I can not see any use in all these things.

F. That we will now consider. You saw the little
ﬂower burst open, and a cloud rose, you say, like
enchantment. Now all this is necessary for the nature
of the plant. There are many thousand plants in the
world, and it has pleased God, in his wisdom, to make
them all dilferent. N ow look at this other nettle, which
grew on the opposite side of the road; you see, that it
is not exactly like the one you have just examined.

A. No, papa; this has little ﬂat seeds instead of
ﬂowers.

F. Very right, my dear. Now, in order to make
those seeds grow, it is ‘‘necessary that the little ﬂower
of this plant and the seed of that should be together,
as they are in most others. But plants can not walk,
like animals. The wisdom of God, therefore, has pro-
vided a remedy for this. When the little ﬂower bursts
open, it throws out a ﬁne powder, which you saw rise
like a cloud; this is conveyed by the air to the other
plant, and when” it falls upon the seed of that plant, it
gives it power to grow, and makes it a perfect seed,
which, in its turn, when it falls to the ground, will pro-
duce a new plant. Were it not for this ﬁne powder,
that seed would never be perfect, or complete.

A. ’.l.‘hat is very curious, indeed; and I see the use

170 NEW FOURTH READER.

of the little cloud and the ﬂower; but the leaf that
stung me, of what use can that be? There, dear papa,
I am afraid I puzzle you to tell me that.

F. Even these stings are made useful to man. The
poor people in some +countries, use them instead of
+blisters, when they are sick. Those leaves which do
not sting are used by some for food, and from the stalk,
others get a stringy bark, which answers the purpose
of ﬂax. Thus you see, that even the despised nettle
is not made in vain; and this may teach you, that We
only need to understand the Works of God, to see that,
“in goodness and wisdom he has made them all.”

' ExE1tcIsEs.——What is botany? Of what use is the nettle?
Is there probably any thing in existence which is useless? Do

We know the uses of. all plants or animals? Should we therefore
conclude that there are any that are useless? Why not‘?

1. THERE Was a little boy, about thirteen yearsold,
Whose name Was Casabianca. His father Was the
‘commander of a ship-of-War. The little boy Went
with his father to the seas. His ship was once in a
'*terrible battle off the mouth of the Nile.

2. In the midst of the thunders of the battle, While
the shot Were ﬂying thickly around, and ﬂooding the

1 decks With blood, this brave boy stood by the side of
. his father, ”'faithfully discharging the duties Which Were

"assigned to him.
3. At last his father placed him in a certain part of

the ship, to perform some “‘service, and told him to

remain at his post till he should call him away. As
the father Went to some distant part of the ship, to
notice the "progress of the battle, a ball from the
*enemy’s vessel laid him dead upon the deck.

4. But the son, unconscious of his father’s death,
and faithful to the trust reposed in him, remained at
his post, Waiting for his father’s orders. The battle
raged "dreadfully around him. The blood of the, slain
ﬂowed at his feet. The ship took ﬁre, and the "threat-
ening ﬂames drew nearer and nearer.

THE ECLECTIC SERIES,‘ 173

5. Still, this noble-hearted boy would not *disobey
his father. In the face of blood, and balls, and ﬁre, he
stood ﬁrm and +obedz'ent. The sailors began to desert
the burning and sinking ship, and the boy cried out,
“Father, may I go ?”

6. But no voice of ‘‘permission could come from the
mangled body of his lifeless father; and the boy, not
knowing that he was dead, would rather die than dis-
obey.’ And there that boy stood, at his post, till every
man had deserted the ship; he stood and perished in
the ﬂames. His death has been described in the fol-
lowing beautiful lines.

7. The boy stood on the burning deck,
Whence all but him had ﬂed,
The ﬂame that lit the battle’s “wreck,
Shone round him o’er the dead.

A 8. Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
As born to rule the storm;

A creature of heroic blood,
A proud, though child-like form.

9. The ﬂames rolled on; he would not go,
Without his fa.ther’s word;
That father, faint in death below,
His voice no longer heard.

10. He called aloud, “Say, father, say,
If yet my task is done?”
He knew not. that the chieftain lay
Unconscious of his son.

11. “Speak, father,” once again he cried,
“If I may yet be gone;
And”—but the booming shot replied,
And fast the ﬂames rolled, on.

1. Uncle T/Lamas. Well, boys, I am glad to see you
again. Since I last saw you, I have made quite a tour,
and at some future time, will describe to you what I
have seen. I promised at this meeting, however, to tell
you something about animals, and'I propose to begin
with the Horse. But I know that you like “stories
better than ﬂeeturing, so I will proceed at once to tell
you some which Ihave gathered for you.

2. Frank. We never feel tired of listening to you,
Uncle Thomas. We know you always have-something
curious to tell us. i

176 NEW FOURTH READER.

3. Uncle Thomas. Well then, Frank, to begin at once
with the horse.

4,. In several parts of the world there are to be
found large herds of wild horses. In South America,
the ‘immense plains are inhabited by them, and, it is
said, that ten thousand are sometimes found in a single
herd. These herds are always ‘preceded by a leader,
who directs their motions; and such is the ’"regularity
withiwhich they perform their movements, that it seems
as if they could hardly be surpassed by the best trained
cavalry.

5. It is extremely ‘dangerous for ‘travelers to meet
a herd of this description. When they are +unaccus-
tomed to the sight of such a mass of creatures, they

can not help feeling greatly alarmed at their rapid and ,

‘apparently ﬁrresistible approach. The trampling of

the animals sounds like distant thunder; and such is

the rapidity and impetuosity of their advance, that it
seems to threaten instant destruction.

6. Suddenly, however, they sometimes stop short,
utter a loud and ‘piercing +neigh, and, with a rapid
wheel, take an opposite course, a.nd altogether dis-
appear. ; On such "‘occasions it requires great care in
the traveler to prevent his horses from "breaking loose
and *escaping with the wild herd.

7. In those countries where wild horses are so *plen-
tiful, the inhabitants do not take the trouble to raise
them, but whenever they want one, they mount upon
an animal accustomed to the sport, and gallop over the
plain toward a herd, which is readily found at no great
distance. i ‘ '

8. The rider gradually approaches some "stragglcrs
from the main body, and, having selected the one he
wishes, he dextrously throws the +lasso, (which is a
long rope with a running noose, and which is ﬁrmly
ﬁxed to his saddle,) in such a manner as to +entangle

9. In an instant, he jumps off his horse, Wraps his
cloak round the head of the captive, forces a bit into
his mouth, and straps a saddle on his back. He then
removes the cloak, and the animal starts on his feet.
With equal quickness the hunter leaps into his saddle;
and, in spite of the kicking of the captive, keeps his

strange, however, that the Arabian horse should be
the most excellent, when we consider the care and
kindness With which it is treated One of the best
stories which I have ever heard of the love of an

Arabian for his steed, is that "related of an Arab,”

from whom an English officer wished to ‘‘purchase his
horse.

12. The animal was a bright bay mare, of ﬁne form
and great beauty; and the owner, proud of her appear-
ance and qualities, paraded her before the Englishman’s
tent, until she "attracted his ‘attention. On being
asked if he would sell her, “What will you give me?”
was the reply. “That depends upon her age. I sup-
pose she is past ﬁve?” “Guess again,” said he.
“Four?” “Look at her mouth,” said the Arab, with
a smile. On examination she was found to be about
three. This, from her size and symmetry, greatly in-
creased her value.

13. The gentleman said, “I will give you ﬁfty to-
mans,” (nearly two hundred and ﬁfty dollars). “A
little more, if you please,” said the fellow, somewhat
‘*entertained. “Eighty—-a hundred.” He shook his

, head and smiled. The officer at last came to two hund-.
red tomans, (nearly one thousand dollars). “Well,”

said the Arab, “you need not tempt me further. You
are a rich nobleman, and, I am told, have loads‘ of
silver and gold. Now,” added he, “you want my
mare, but you shall not have her for all you have got.”
He put spurs to his horse, and was soon out of the
reach of itemptation. -

14. The horse can swim, when necessary, as well as
most, other animals, although he is not very -fond of the
water. Some years ago, a vessel was driven upon the
rocks, on the coast of the Cape of Good Hope, and

most of the crew fell an immediate “sacriﬁce to the

waves. Those who were left, were seen from the

shore, ‘‘clinging to the diiferent pieces of the wreck.
The sea ran so high, that no boat could venture off to
their +assistance. '

15. Meanwhile, a planter had come from his farm,
to be a +spectator of the +shipwreck. His heart was
melted at the sight of the unhappy seamen, and know-
ing the bold spirit of his horse, and his excellence as a
‘swimmer, he determined to make a desperate effort
for their deliverance. Having blown a little brandy
into his horse’s nostrils, he pushed into the midst of
the breakers. At ﬁrst, they both disappeared, but it
was not long before they “‘ﬂoated to the surface, and
swam up to the ‘“wreck; When taking two men with

him, each of whom, held on by one of his boots, he‘

brought them safe to shore.

16. This was repeated no less than seven times, and
he saved fourteen lives; but on his return, the eighth
time, being much ‘fatigued, and meeting a tremendous
wave, he lost his balance, and sunk in a moment. His
horse swam safely to land, but its gallant rider sank to
rise no more.

1.. ON a fair morning, in the latter part of the sultry
month of July, James Blount, an amiable and ‘intelli-
gent lad of ﬁfteen, in company with his cousin Henry,
much younger than himself, Walked out in search of
berries.

2. After some 1 hours’ rambling, Henry became
alarmed at the "threatening_+aspect of the Weather.

- The sky became suddenly overcast with Winds and

clouds; the rolling thunder began to be heard at a
distance, and a dark, dense cloud, rising slowly and
majestically from the West, gave strong “indications of
an?‘ ’“approaching tempest.

3. “James,” exclaimed Henry, with much anxiety,
“What shall we do here in this Wide and opengpasture,
so farfrom home? How much I Wish there Was no
such thing in nature as thunder and ‘*lightning.”

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. '131

4. “Henry,” replied James, “that is a very Wrong
and Wicked wish. All the Works of God are Iounded
in Wisdom, and are intended to answer some benevolent
purpose; and did you but understand the importance
of lightning to our atmosphere, you could not but con-
sider it one of the most ‘essential blessings our World
enjoys.”

5. -“Blessing?” said Henry, “can that be ‘called a
blessing, which destroys men’s lives, and sometimes
burns up houses and other ”’buildings? Only think,
how often We hear of people and beasts killed, and
buildings burnt by lightning.”

6. “I freely admit,” said James, “that such awful
occurrences sometimes take place. But come, it
already begins to rain, and We must seek a shelter,
Where I will endeavor to explain to you What appears
so "‘contradictory.”  

7 . “But where shall We go,” asked Henry; “shall
We run to that tall, shady tree yonder?” “No,” re-

plied James, “We must not go there.” “Well, then, .

shall We run to that barn, that stands onthe hill yon-
der?” “No,” answered James, “neither must We go
there.” “But What do you mean?” asked Henry,
+pettishly; “where shall we go, then?”

8. “I will tell you,” said James, “Where We must
go; and after We get there, I will tell you What I mean.

Let us run to yonder thick cluster of underbrush, and I

take shelter beneath its +foliage.” Accordingly, they
hastened to- the spot, and found a tolerably .safe retreat
from the rain. After resting a few moments, James
said, “I will now endeavor to explain to you, Henry,
why you should consider lightning a blessing, rather
than a ‘“calamity.

and whenever it becomes overloaded with these vapors,
disease and death Will follow. Now, lightning burns
up these +poisonous vapors, and renders the air pure
and wholesome.  

10. “Notwithstanding the frequent instances of the
awful effects of lightning in destroying life, etc., to
which you have “talluded, yet consider, for a moment,
how small is the number of people thus killed, when
’'compared with the great mass of mankind, who are
enabled to live‘ and breathe, in consequence of the
purity of the air produced by this self-same agent,
lightning. ' i

11. “Besides, you might, with the same "propriety,
complain of the wind and the waves, which so often
prove destructive to human life and property. But
who would dare to wish that the winds might cease to
blow, or that the waters of the rivers and the "‘oceans
might be dried up? Let us not be unthankful for
these great blessings, merely because some remote and
possible evil may be connected with them.” '

12. “I perceive, and candidly confess my error,”
said Henry; “but pray inform me, James,-why you
"objected to going to that tree for shelter; it was full
as” At that moment, a '*tremendous crash was
heard not far from them, “immediately followed by an
appalling clap of thunder.

13. They looked toward the tree, about which Henry
was just speaking, and beheld it +rive_n from the top to
its very rgots, with many of its branches scattered
about the ground. “There,” said James, “ is a better
answer to the question you were about asking, than

 

r—.;..,':€waS.in my power to give you. You will now under-

stand, that it is ‘‘extremely dangerous to take refuge,
during a thunder-storm, under a tree of any descrip-
tion; and more ”“especially, under one so high and so
distant from other trees as that you mentioned.

THE ECLECTIC snnrns. 133

14. “But, that you may know the reason why it is

. thus dangerous, I would observe that the lightning is

generally attracted or drawn toward whatever may be
the nearest to it ; and as trees commonly rise higher,
and approach nearer the clouds, than any other object,

so they are more exposed, and are more frequently,

struck by lightning, than any thing else. Had we
repaired to that tree for shelter, we probably should
have been either torn to pieces, or +dreadfully ‘injured
by the shock.”

15. “But the barn,” said Henry, “what were your
reasons for not going to the barn? That, surely, is
not a very high object.” Scarcely were these words
uttered, when another vivid ﬂash and startling peal
rent the heavens, and produced a pause in their con-
versation; and looking out from under the thick copse,
they beheld that same barn in ﬂames. Deeply agitated
at the sight, and at. their almost miraculous escape,
Henry looked toward his companion with a kind of
awe, which seemed to say: “Surely, you are a prophet.”

16. James, beholding his astonishment, renewed the
conversation, by saying, “Think not, Henry, “that I
have been favored by High Heaven to foresee these
events. In refusing to go to those two places you
proposed, and which, it now appears, have suffered so
much by lightning, I acted only on the ground of +prob-
ability. As to the first case, I hope I h-ave already
‘tsatisﬁed your mind. It now only remains, that I as-
sign my reason for not going to the second“place you
mentioned. 2. '

17. “I have somewhere seen the fact stated, that
barns are much more liable to be struck by lightning
than any other building; and the reason given for it
was, ‘that the heat or vapor arising from the vegetable
matter in barns, creates an ascending current, which
forms an excellent conductor for the lightning.’ ”

1. ON a rainy evening, as I was alone in my cham-
ber, I took up my ﬂute, and ‘‘commenced playing a
tune. In a few minutes, my ’'attention was directed to
a mouse, that I saw creeping from its hole and +ad-
vancing to the chair in which I was sitting.

2. I ceased playing, and it suddenly ran back to its
hole. I began again shortly afterward, and was much
surprised to see it return and take its old position.
The '*appearance of the little animal was truly *de-
lightful; it +crouched itself on the ﬂoor, shut its eyes,
and appeared in an ecstasy. I

3. I ceased playing, and it instantly +disappeared ,

againp This experiment I repeated frequently with.
the same +success, observing that it was always *dif-
ferently affected, as the music varied from the slow
and plaintive to the brisk and lively. It ﬁnally went
off, and all my arts to induce it- to return, were unavail-

ing. Such frequent and powerful excitements probably
caused its death.

4. ‘A more *remarkable instance of this fact, ap-
peared in one of the public ‘journals, not long since.
It was '*communicated by a gentleman, who was a
witness of the interesting scene. As a few officers on
board a British man-oif—war, in the harbor of Plymouth,
were seated around the ﬁre, one of them began to play
a very plaintive air on the violin. p

5.'He had performed but a few minutes, when a
mouse, *apparently frantic, made his ‘appearance in
the middle of the floor. The strange gestures of the
little animal strongly excited the sympathy of the com-
pany, who, with one consent, resolved to suffer it to
continue its singular actions "unmolested.

6. Its ‘exertions now appeared to be greater every
moment; it shook its head, leaped about the floor, and
exhibited signs of the most ecstatic delight. It was
observed, that, in +proportion as the tones of the in-
strument approached the soft and plaintive, the feelings
of the animal appeared to be "increased. _

7. After performing actions which an animal so
diminutive, would seem, at ﬁrst sight, *incapable of
performing, the little ‘*creature, to the +astonishment
of the hitherto delighted fspectators, suddenly ceased
to move, fell down and expired, without showing any
signs of pain. '

ExEnoIsEs.——When the gentleman was playing on his ﬂute,
what did he see that excited his attention? When he stopped
playing, what did the mouse do? What became of it? Where did
another remarkable instance of this kind happen? In what part
of England is Plymouth? How did the mouse act? What became
of it? ‘What word can you put in the place of “ecstasy,” in the
2d paragraph, and make sense? What, in the place of “plaintive,”
in the 3d paragraph? What in the place of “experiment?”

In the 6th paragraph, what adjective is there in the comparative
degree? What, in the superlative? Name the pronouns in the

paragraph. How many kinds of pronouns are there?

1. THE "Giraﬁ"e'is a native of ”“Africa. It is of sin-
gular shape and size, and bears some iresemblance
both to the camel and the deer. The mouth is small;

A the eyes are full and brilliant; the tongue ' rough,

very. long, andending in a point. ‘ The neck”:'is long
and slender, and from the shoulder to the top of the
head, it measures between seven and eight feet ;"*from
the ground to the top of the shoulder, is commonly ten
or eleven feet; so that the height of a full grown
Giraffe is seventeen or eighteen feet. .

2. The hair is of a deep brown color in the male,
and of alight, or yellowish brown in the female. The
skin is ‘“beautifully diversiﬁed with White spots. They
have short blunt horns, and hoofs like those of the ox.
In their Wild state, they feed on the leaves of a gum-
bearing tree, peculiar to Warm climates.

4. Le Vaillant, (the ““celebrated French traveler

and naturalist), was the ﬁrst Who gave us any exact‘

account of the form and habits of the Gira-ﬂie. While
he was traveling in South Africa, he happened one day
to discover a hut, covered with the skin of one of those
animals; and learned to his surprise, that he was now
/in a part of. the country Where the creature Was found.

He could not rest contented until he had seen the

animal alive, and secured a specimen.

5. Having on several days obtained sight of some
of them, he, with his +attendants, on horseback, and
‘*accompanied with dogs, gave chase; but they baffled
all pursuit. After a chase of a whole day, which
*eﬂ'ected nothing but the fatigue of the party, he began
to despair of ““success.

6. “The next day,” says he, “by sunrise, I was in
+pursuit of game, in the hope of obtaining some *pro-
visions for my men. After several hours’ fatigue, we
saw, at the turn of a hill, seven Giraifes, Which my
pack of dogs instantly pursued. Six of them went off
together; but the seventh, cut oﬂ' by my dogs, took
another way.

7. “I ‘followed the single one at full speed, but in
spite of the efforts of my horse, she got so much ahead
of me, that, in turning a little hill, I lost sight of her
altogether, and I gave up the pursuit. My dogs, how-
ever, were not so easily exhausted. They were soon
so close upon her, that she was obliged to stop and
defend herself.» From the noise they made, I con-
jectured that they had got the animal into a corner,
and I again pushed forward. .

8. “I had scarcely got round the hill, when I per-
ceived her surrounded by the dogs, and endeavoring to
drive them away by heavy kicks. In a moment, I was
on my feet, and a shot from my carbine brought her to
the earth. I was delighted with my victory. . I was
now able to add to the riches of natural history. I
was now able to destroy the romance which +attached
to this animal, and to ‘“establish the truth of its +ex—
istence.”

ExERcIsEs.—Of what country is the Giraife a native? To
what height does it attain when full grown? On what does it
live? How does it defend itself?

1. A FEW years since, a child was lost in the Woods.

He Was out, with his brothers and sisters, gathering
berries, and was *accidentally *separated from them,

i and lost. The children, after looking in vain for some

time in search of the little Wanderer, returned, just in
the dusk of the evening, to inform their parents, that
their brother Was lost and could not be found.

2. The Woods, at that time, were full of bears. The
darkness of a cloudy night was rapidly coming on, and
the alarmed father, gathering a few of his ‘neighbors,
hastened in search of the lost child. The mother
remained at home, almost ‘distracted With suspense.

3. As the clouds gathered, and the darkness in-
creased, the father and the neighbors, with highly
excited fears, traversed the Woods in all directions,
and raised loud shouts to attract the attention of the

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 193

child. But their search was in vain. They could ﬁnd
no trace of the wanderer; ' and, as they stood under the
*boughs of the lofty trees, and listened, that if possible
they might hear his feeble voice, no sound was borne
to their ears but the ‘melancholy +moaning of the wind,

, as it swept through the thick branches of the forest.

4. The gathering clouds threatened an approaching
storm, and the deep darkness of the night had already
‘enveloped them. It is difficult to conceive what were
the feelings of that father. And who could "imagine
how deep the distress which ﬁlled the bosom of that
mother, as she heard the wind, and beheld the darkness
in which her child was wandering!

5. The search was continued in vain, till nine o’clock
in the evening. Then, one of the party was sent back
to the village, to collect the ‘‘inhabitants’ for a more
'*extensive search. The bell rung the alarm, and the
cry of ﬁre +resounded through the streets. It was,
however, ‘“ascertained that it was not ﬁre which caused
the alarm, but that the bell tolled the more solemn
tidings of a lost child. ‘

6. Every heart sympathized in «the sorrows ‘of the
distracted parents. Soon, multitudes of the people
were seen ascending the ‘hill, upon the declivity of
which the village stood, to aid in the ‘‘search. Ere
long, the rain began to fall, but no tidings came back
to the village of the lost child. Hardly an eye was
that night closed in sleep, and there was not a mother
whoidid not feel for the parents.

7. The night passed away, and the morning "dawned,
and yet no tidings came. At last, those engaged in
the search, met together, and held a *consultation.
They made "*arrangements for a more minute search,
and agreed that, in case the child was found, a gun
should be ﬁred, to give a signal to the ‘rest of the

party.

194 NEW FOURTH READER.

8. As the sun arose, the clouds were ‘‘scattered, and
the whole "landscape +glittered in the rays of the
bright morning. But that village was deserted and
still. The stores Were closed, and ’“business was hushed.
_Mothers were walking the streets, with +sympathizing
icountenances and anxious hearts. There was but
one thought there: “What has become of the lost
child?”  

9. All the +a1fections and interest of the neighbor-.
hood, were ﬂowing in’ one deep and broad channel
toward the little wanderer. About nine in the morn-
ing, the signal gun was ﬁred, which ”"announced that
the child was found; and for a moment, how dreadful
was the +suspense! Was it found a mangled +corpse,
or was it alive and well?

10. Soon,’ a joyful shout proclaimed the safety of
the child. The shout was borne from ‘“tongue to tongue,
till the whole forest rang again with the joyful sound.
A "messenger rapidly bore the tidings to the distracted
mother. A procession was ‘immediately formed by
those engaged in the search. The child was placed
upon a platform, hastily formed from the boughs of
trees, and borne in triumph atthe head of the proces-
sion. When they arrived at the brow of the hill, they
rested for a moment, and proclaimed their success with
three loud and ‘*animated cheers. ,

11. The procession then moved on, till they arrived
in front of the dwelling, where the parents of the child

"resided. The mother, who stood at the door, ‘with

“Fstreaming eyes and +throbbing heart, could no longer
restrain herself or her feelings.

12. She rushed into the street, clasped her child to T

her bosom, and wept aloud._j' Every eye was ﬁlled with
tears, and, for a moment, all were silent. But sud-

denly, some one “gave a signal for a shout. One loud, i

and long, and happy note of joy rose from the "assem-

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 195

bled multitude, and they then Went to their business
and their homes. p

13. There was more joy over the one child that Was
found, than over the ninety and nine that Went not
iastray. Likewise, there is joy in the presence of the
angels of God, over one sinner that repenteth. But
still, this is a feeble representation of the love of our
Father in heaven for us, and of the joy with which the
angels Welcome the returning wanderer.

14. The mother can not feel for her child that is
lost, as God feels for the unhappy Wanderer in the
paths of sin. If a mother can feel so much, What must
be the feelings of our Father in heaven, for those who
have strayed from his love? If man can feel so deep
a sympathy, What. must bethe ‘emotions which glow in
the bosom of angels?

E x E R c I s E s .—What is this story about? Where was the child
lost‘? Who went out in search of the little wanderer? What was
to be the signal, when they found the child? Did they ﬁnd him
the ﬁrst night‘? What did the neighbors then do? What sound
proclaimed the recovery of the child? How was the child taken to
its mother? What were the feelings of the mother on beholding it?
When is there joy in heaven? Does not this imply the great worth
of the soul? T

1. A GENTLEMAN, just returned from the city, was
*surrounded by his children, who were eager to hear
the news; and Still more eager to see the contents of
a small portmanteau, which were, one by one, carefully
unfolded and displayed to view. After distributing
among them a few presents, the father took his seat
again, and the following conversation took place.

2. Father. I have brought from the city, formy own
use, something far more curious and valuable than any
of the little gifts which you have ‘‘received. It is too
good to present to any of you, but I will give you a
brief ““description of it, and then, perhaps, allow you to
examine it. .

3.iThis small instrument displays the most perfect
‘ingenuity of construction, and the most exquisite
beauty of ’'workmanship. From its extreme ”delic'acy,

it, is so easily injured that a sort of light *curtain,

198 Q NEW FOURTH READER.

adorned with a beautiful fringe, is always’ provided,
and so placed as to fall, in a moment, on the approach
of the slightest danger. Its external ‘appearance is

I always more or less beautiful, although in this respect,

there is a great *variety in the different sorts.

4. But the internal construction is the same in all,
and is, in the highest degree, curious and wonderful.
By a slight movement, easily effected by the person to
whom it belongs, you can ascertain, with great “*accu—
racy, the size, color, shape, "weight, and value of any
article whatever. A person, who has one of these
instruments, is saved the trouble of asking a thou-
sand questions, and of making +troublesome ‘experi-
ments, and, at the same time, by its use, he obtains
much more ‘information than he could in any other
way.

5. Edward. If they are such very useful things, I
wonder that every body that can afford it, ‘does not
have one.  

6. Father. They are not so uncommon as you may
suppose. I know several persons who have one or two
of them. i

7. Edward. How large is it, father? Could I hold
it in my hand? i .

8. Father. You might; but I should be very sorry
to trust mine with you. ‘

9. Edward. You will be obliged to take very great
care of it, then. i

10. Father. Indeed, I must. I intend every night
to +inelose it in the small screen of which I told you,
and it must, besides, sometimes be washed in a certain
'*c‘olorless ﬂuid, kept for this‘ purpose. But notwith-
standing the *tenderness of this instrument, it may be
darted to a great distance, without the least injury or
any danger of losing it.

11. Henry. How high can you dart it, father?

12. Father. I am almost afraid to tell you, lest you
should think I am ‘jesting.

13. Edward. Higher than this house, I suppose!

14. Father. Much higher. 

15. Henry. Then how do you get it again? ,

16. Father. It is easily cast down by a gentle move-
ment that does it no injury.

17. Edward. But who can do this?

18. Father. The person Whose business it is to take
care of it. v -

19. Henry. Well, I can not understand you at all;
but do tell us, father, What it is chieﬂy used for.

20. Father. Its uses are so various, that I know not
which to mention. It is of great service in decipher-
ing old manuscripts, and, indeed, has its use in modern
prints. It Will assist us greatly in ‘acquiring all kinds

of knowledge, and Without it, some of the most sub-  

lime parts of creation would be matter of mere con-
jecture.

21. Edward. Well, tell us something more about it.

22. Father. It is of a very ipenetrating quality,
and can often discover secrets which could be ‘‘detected
by no other means. It must he confessed, however,
that it is equally liable to reveal them. '

23. Henry. What! can itspeak, then?

24. Father. It is sometimes said to do so; espe-
cially if it meets with one of its own *species.

25. Edward. Of what color is it?

'26. Father. They vary in this respect.

27. Edward. Of What color is yours?

28. Father. I believe it is of a darkish color, but,
to confess the truth, I never saw it in my life.

29. Both. Never saw it in your life?

 Father. No, nor do I wish to see it; but I have
seeniri-ea representation of it, which is so exact that my
"curiosity is perfectly “lsatisﬁed.

PRONOUNCE correctly. Do not say elephant for el-e-phant;
commuss for com-merce; attact for attack ; tugether for to—geth-er;
oluz for al-ways ; dreac{f’l for dread-ful. E

1. THE *‘elephant is the largest of quadrupeds; his
height is from eight to fourteen feet, and his length
from ten to ﬁfteen feet. His form is that of a hog; his
eyes are small and lively; his ears are long, broad, and

’ pendulous. He has two large tusks, which form the

ivory of commerce, and a trunk or proboscis at the
end of the nose, Which he uses to takehis food With,
and for attack or defense. His color is a dark ash
brown. _

2. Elephants often, +assemble in large troops; and
as they march in search of food, the forests seem to
tremble under them. They eat the branches of trees,
together with roots, herbs, leaves, grain, and fruit, but
will not touch ﬁsh nor ﬂesh. In a state of nature, they
arggpeaceable, mild, and brave; exerting their power
onlf for their own protection, or in °‘defense of their
own +species.

PUBLlSHERS’ NOTICE;

THE widely—extended approval and patronage bestowed upon the
ECLECTIC EDUCATIONAL SERIES, for several years past, have given
to them a constantly increasing demand. Their sale is not equaled
by any other similar School-Books in the United States.

Such approval renders it the duty and PRIVILEGE of the Pub—«
lishers to sustain and increase their usefulness, by such improve-
ments as are demanded by judicious educational progress. With
this view,

McGUFFEY’S ECLECTIC READERS

Have been entirely remodeled. Such lessons as discriminating
practical teachers had found the least interesting, have been re-
moved, and others, with large additions——especially of primary
matter———have been introduced into the Series.

A careful attention to progression, by which the learner is led

forward, step by step, by an easy gradation; a pure moral and 4

religious sentiment, inculcated in interesting and instructive les-
sons; a neat typography and handsome style of publication, render
them the best class-books for reading in the English language, and,
at their very low prices, the cheapest.

 To secure accuracy in those Who order books, these volumes,
six in number, are entitled ‘

McGUrrEY’s NEW ECLECTIC READERS,

That they may not be confounded with the former editions, which
are still continued in publication. '

3. Elephants are found both in Asia and ‘Africa,
but they are of diﬂerent species, the +Asiatio elephant
having ﬁve toes, and the African, three. These ani-
mals are caught by stratagem, and when tamed, they
are the most gentle, obedient, and patient, as Well as
the most docile and +sagacious of all quadrupeds. They
are used to carry burdens, and for “traveling. Their
iattachment to their masters is ”“remarkable; and they
seem to live but to serve and obey them. They always
‘tkneel to receive their riders or the loads they have to
carry.

4. The ‘tanecdotes *illustrating the +character of the
elephant, are numerous.   An elephant, which was kept
for ‘exhibition at London, Was often required,‘ as is
usual in such exhibitions, to pick up with his trunk a
piece of money, thrown upon the ﬂoor for this purpose.
On ong occasion, a sixpence was thrown, which hap-—
pened to roll a little out of his reach, not far from the
Wall. Being desired to pick it up, he stretched out his
proboscis several times to reach it; failing in this, he

THE ECLECTIC smuns. 203

stood motionless a few seconds, +e~vidently "considering
how to act. ~ s

5. He then stretched his proboscis in a straight line-

as far as he could, a little distance above the "coin, and
blew with great force against the wall. The angle

Vrproduced by the "opposition of the wall, made the
,*current of air act under the coin, as he evidently

supposed it would ; and it was curious to observe the
sixpence traveling toward the animal, till it came within
his reach, and he picked it up.

6. A soldier in India, who had frequently carried an
elephant some arrack, being one day ‘intoxicated, and
seeing himself pursued by the guard, whose orders
were to conduct him to prison, took refuge under the
elephant. The guard soon ﬁnding his retreat, "at-
tempted in vain to take him from his asylum; for the
elephant vigorously defended him with his trunk.

7. As soon as the ’'soldier became sober, and saw
himself placed under such an unwieldy animal, he was
so “terriﬁed that he scarcely durst moveeither hand or
foot; but the elephant soon caused his fears to subside,

by "caressing him with his trunk, and thus tacitly say-.

ing, “Depart in peace.”

8. A pleasing anecdote is related of an elephant,
which was the property of the nabob of Lucknow.
There was, in that city, an epidemic +disorder, making
dreadful ‘thavoc among the inhabitants. The road to
the palace gate was covered with the sick and dying,
lying on the ground at the moment the nabob was
about to pass. a t

9. Regardless of the suﬁering he must cause, the
nabob held on his way, not caring whether his beast

’ trod upon the poor helpless creatures or not. But the

animal, more kind-hearted than his master, carefully
cleared the path of the poor, helpless "wretches as he
went along. T Some he lifted with his trunk, entirely

out of the road. Some he set upon their feet, and-

among the others, he stepped so +carefully, that not an
‘individual was injured.

1. I HAD once a favorite black hen, “ a great beauty,”
she Was called by every one, and so I thought her;
her feathers were so jetty, and her topping so white
and full! She knew my voice‘ as well as any dog, and
used to run cackling and bustling to my hand to re-

THE ECLECTIC’ SERIES. 205

ceive the fragments that I never failed to ‘collect fromi

the breakfast table for “Yarico,” as she was called.

2. Yarico, by the time she was a year old, hatched
a respectable family of chickens; little, cowering, timid
things at ﬁrst, but, in due time, they became ﬁne
chubby ones; and old Nora said, “If I could only keep
Yarico out of the copse, it \would do; but the copse is
full of weasels and of foxes.

3. “I have driven her back twenty times; but she
watches’ till some one goes out of the gate, and then
she’s off again. It is always the case with young
hens, Miss; they think they know better than their
keepers; and nothing cures them but losing a brood or
two of chickens.” I have often thought since, that
young people as well as young hens, buy their '*experi-
ence equally dear. I
y 4. One morning, afteribreakfast, I went to seek my
favorite in the poultry-yard; plenty of hens were there,
but no Yarico. The gate was open, and, as I con-
cluded shehad sought the forbidden copse, I proceeded

there, accompanied by the "yard-mastiff, a noble fellow,

steady and sagacious as a judge.

5. At the end of a lane, ﬂanked on one side by} a
quickset hedge, on the other by a wild common, what
was called the copse +commenced; but before I arrived
near the spot, I heard a loud and tremendous cackling,
and met two young, long-legged pullets, running with

both wings and feet toward home. Jock pricked up’

his sharp ears, and would have set off at full; gallop to
the copse; but I restrained him, hastening onward,
however, at ‘the top of my speed, thinking I [had as
good a right to see what was the matter as Jock.

6. Poor Yaricol An impertinent fox-cub had at-
tempted to’ carry off one of her children; but she had
managed to get them» behind her in the hedge, and
venturing boldly forth, had placed herself in front, and

206 ' _NEW FOURTH READER.

"positively. kept the impudent animal at bay. His
desire for plunder had prevented his *noticing our
appigéach, and Jock soon made him feel the *superi-
ority of an English mastiff over a cub-fox.

7. The most interesting portion of my talewis to
come. Yarico not only never afterward ventured to
the copse, but formed a strong friendship for the dog,
which had preserved her family.‘ Whenever he ap-
peared in the yard, she would run to meet him, prating
and clucking all the time, and impeding his progress
by Walking between his legs, to his no small +annoy-
ance. If any other dog entered the yard, she would
ﬂy at him most furiously, thinking, perhaps, that he
would injure her chickens; but she ‘evidently con-
sidered Jock her especial ‘‘protector, and treated him
accordingly.

8.,It was very droll to see the *peculiar look with

which he regarded his feathered friend; not knowing
exactly What to make of her civilities, and doubting
how they should be received. When her family‘ Were
educated, and able to do Without her care, she Was a
frequent visitor at J ock’s kennel, and would, if per-
mitted, roost there at night, instead of returning With
the rest of the poultry to the hen-house. Yarico '*cer-
tainly Was a most grateful and interesting bird.

9. One could almost believe a parrot had +intellect,
When he keeps up a conversation so +spiritedly; and it
certainly is singular to observe how ‘*accurately a Well-
trained bird will apply his knowledge. A friend of
mine knew one that had been taught many ‘-‘sentences;
thus, “Sally, Poll Wants her breakfast!” “Sally, Poll
Wants her tea!” but she never mistook the one for the
other; breakfast was ‘invariably demanded in the
morning, and tea in the afternoon; and she always
hailed her master, but no one else‘, by “How do you

do, Mr. A 2"

THE ECLEOTIC SERIES. 207

10. She was a most amusing bird, and could whistle
dogs, which she had great pleasure in doing. 1 She
would drop bread out of her cage as she. hung   Ac
street door, and whistle a number about her, and.th’é.g,

just as they were going to possess themselves of her

bounty, utter ashrill scream of “Get out, dogs 1:” with
such +vehemence and ‘*authority, as dispersed the
assembled company without a morsel, to her inﬁnite
delight. . .

11. How wonderful is thatinstinct, by which the
bird of passage performs its annual migration! But
how still more wonderful is it, when the bird, after its
voyage of thousands of miles has been '*performed, and
new lands visited, returns to the ‘‘precise window or
eaves where, the summer before, it ﬁrst enjoyed ex-
istence! And yet, such is “unquestionably the fact.

12. Four brothers had watched with indignation the
felonious attempts of a sparrow to possess himself of
the nest of a house-martin, in which lay its young
brood of four +unfledged birds.

13. The little fellows considered themselves as cham-
pions for the bird which had come over land and sea,
and chosen its shelter under their mother’s roof. They
therefore *marshaled themselves with blow-guns, to
execute summary ivengeance; but their well—meant
endeavors brought "destruction upon the mud-built
domicile they wished to defend. Their artillery loos-
ened the foundations, and down it came, precipitating
its four little inmates to the ground. The mother of
the children, good Samaritan-like, replaced the little
outcasts in their nest, and set it in the open window of
an unoccupied chamber.

14. The parent-birds, after the ﬁrst terror was over,

did not appear disconcerted by the change of situation,
but hourly fed their young as usual, and testiﬁed, by
their unwearied twitter of pleasure, the satisfaction and

208 NEW FOURTH READER.

conﬁdence they felt. There the young birds were duly
ﬂedged, and from that Window they began their ﬂight,
and “entered upon life.

15. The next spring, With the reappearance of the
martins, came four, Which familiarly ﬂew into the
chamber, visited all the walls, and expressed their
recognition by the most clamorous twitterings of joy.
They were, without question, the very birds that had
been bred there the preceding year.

covud for cov-er’d.

1. How dear to my heart are the scenes of my childhood,
When fond "lrecollection presents them to view!
The orchard, the meadow, the deep “ttangled wild-wood,
And every loved spot which my infancy knew;
The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it;
The bridge and the rock where the cataract fell;
The cot of my father, t‘.:e_Tdairy-house nigh it,
And e’en the rude ‘tbucket which hung in the well:
‘ The old oaken bucket, the iron—bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket which hung in.the well.

Q‘

2. That moss-covered ‘Vessel Ihail as a +treasure ;
For often, at noon, when returned from the ﬁeld,
I found it the source of an_.,exquisite ‘“pleasure,
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.
,How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing,
And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell ;
Then soon, with the +emblem of truthoverﬂowing,
And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well:
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 213

3. How sweet from the green mossy brim to "receive it,
As poised on the curb, it inclined to my lips!
Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it,
Though ﬁlled with the nectar which +Jupiter sips;
And now, far removed from thy '*loved situation.
The tear of regret will intrusively swell,
As fancy reverts to my father’s '*plantation,
And sighs for the bucket which hangs in the well‘
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket, which hangs in the Well.

PROVERBS FROM THE BIBLE.

1. MY son, forget not my law; but let thine heart
keep my commandments: for length of days, and -long
life, and peace, shall they add to thee.

2. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean
not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways
acknowledge him, and He «shall direct thy paths.

3. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not
in the way of evil men. Avoid’ it; pass not by it; turn
from it and pass away. i

4. My son, keep thy father’s commandments, and
forsake not the law of thy mother. Bind them con-
tinually upon thy heart,‘ and tie them about thy neck.

he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.
Blessings are upon the head of the just, but violence
covereth the mouth of the wicked. T

In the dreary night and the drizzling rain?

We met, from the battling ranks apart;
Together our Weapons ﬂashed and fell,
And mine was sheathed in his quivering heart.

a It was all too dark to see his face;
But I heard his death groans, one by one,
And he holds me still in a cold embrace.

But my heart grew cold with a deadly fear———-
  O God! I had heard that voice before!

And then for a while I forgot my pain,
And over the lakelet we seemed to glide

On a forest path, where the shadows fell ;
And I heard again the tremulous tone,
And the tender words of his last farewell.

And our dear old mother will never know
That he died to—night by his brother’s hand.

THE PET FAWN.

1. A PRETTY little fawn. had been brought in, when
very young, from the woods, and nursed and petted, by

a lady in the village, until it had become as tame as  
possible. It was graceful, as those little creatures

always are, and so gentle and playful that it became a
great favorite, following the different members of the
family about, caressed by the neighbors, and welcome
every-Where.

2. One morning, after playing about as usual until

Weary, it lay down in the sunshine, at the feet of one .
of its friends, upon the steps of a store. There came .

along a countryman, who for several years had been a

hunter by pursuit, and who still kept several hounds,

one of which was now with him.

3. The dog, as it approached the spot where the fawn
lay, suddenly stopped. The little animal saw him, and
started to its feet. It had lived more than half its life
among the dogs of the village, and had apparently lost
all fear of them; but it seemed now to know that
an enemy was near. In an instant, its whole nature
seemed changed; all its past habits were forgotten;
every Wild impulse was awake; its head erect, its nos-
trils "dilated, its eyes ﬂashing.

4. In another instant, before the spectators had
thought of the danger, and before its friends could
secure it, the fawn was bounding away through the

street, and the hound in full chase. The ‘bystanders i

were eager to save it; several persons immediately
followed its track; the friends who had long fed and
fondled it, calling the name it had hitherto known, in

«vain. 1
5. Thehunter endeavored to whistle back his dog,

but with no success. In half a minute the fawn had
turned the ﬁrst corner, dashed onward toward the lake,
and thrown itself into the water. But if for a moment
the startled creature believed‘ itself safe in the cool
bosom of the lake, it was soon iundeceived; for the
hound followed in hot and eager chase,~while a dozen
village dogs joined blindly in the ’*pursuit.

6. A large crowd collected on the‘bank——men, wo-

men, and children—anxious for the fate of the little E

animal so well known to them all. Some threw them-
selves into boats, hoping to intercept the hound before
he reached his prey. The *plashing of the oars, the
eager voices of men and boys, and the barking of the
dogs, must have ﬁlled the heart of the poor fawn with

terror and anguish; as though every creature on the

spot where it had once been caressed and fondled, had
suddenly turned into a deadly foe.

7. It was soon seen that the little animal was direct-
ing its course across a bay toward the nearest borders
of "the forest. Immediately the owner of the hound
crossed the bridge, and ran at full speed,‘ hoping to stop
his dog as he landed. On swam the fawn, as it never
swam before; its *delicate head scarcely seen above
the water, but leaving a disturbed track, which +be-
trayed its course alike to its friends and foes. L

8. As it approached the land, the interest became
“intense. The hunter was already on the same side of

THE ECLECTIC SERIES.p 221

the lake, callingloudly and angrily to his dog; but the
hound seemed to have quite forgotten his master’s voice
in the pitiless pursuit. The fawn reached the shore:
with a leap it had crossed the narrow strip of “*beach,
and in another instant it would reach the cover of the
Woods. '

9. The hound followed true to the scent, pointing to
the same spot on the shore; his master, anxious to
meet him, had run at full speed, and was now coming
up at the same critical moment. Will the dog listen to
his voice? or can the hunter reach him in time to
‘seize and control him? A shout from the bank told
that the fawn had passed out of sight into the forest.



 
 

 

 

At the same instant, the hound, as he touched the land,
felt the hunter’s strong arm clutching his neck. The
worst was believed to be over; the fawn was leaping
up the mountain-side, and its enemy restrained. The
other dogs, seeing their leader cowed, were easily
managed.

10. A number of persons, men and boys, dispersed

      

‘t=.—_.~—.:--‘-

. themselves through the woods in search of the little

creature, but without success; they all returned to the
village, reporting that the fawn had not been seen.

Some thought that, after its fright had passed, it would
returnof its own accord. It wore a pretty collar with
its owner’s name engraved upon it, so that it could be
easily known from any other fawn that might be stray-
ing about the woods.

11. Before many hours had passed, a hunter pre-
sented himself to the lady whose pet the little creature

had been, and showed a collar with her name upon" it.  

He said that he was out hunting in the morning, and
saw a fawn in the distance. The little pet, instead of
bounding away as he expected, moved toward him; he
took aim, ﬁred, and shot it through the heart.

ExERc1sEs.~——Why was the fawn a great pet in the village?
How did the fawn know the bound was its enemy? What did the
hound do? What did the spectators do? Did the fawn escape the
dogs? What was its fate?

Scrapewell. It would give mesgreat pleasure to oblige
you, friend Derby; but I am under the "necessity of
going to the mill, this ‘very morning, with a bag of
corn. My wife wants the meal to-day, and you know
What a time there ’ll be if I +disappoint her.

the mill does not go to-day. I heard the miller tell
Will Davis that the Water was too low.

never suit my wife. You can’t +conceive how Whim-

D. If she Were ten times more whimsical than she.

is, I am certain she would like it; for you sold it to
me yourself, and you assured me it was the best you
ever had.

S. Yes, yes! that ’s true, indeed; I always have the
best of every thing. You know, neighbor Derby, that
no one is more ready to oblige a friend than I am; but
I must tell you, the mare this morning refused to eat
hay; and, truly, I am afraid she will not carry you.

D. 0., never fear! I will feed her well with oats on
the road.

S. Oats! neighbor; oats are very dear. i

D. Never mind that. When I have a good job in
view, I never stand for triﬂes.

.S. But it is very “!slippery; and I am really afraid
she will fall and break your neck.

1). Give yourself no uneasiness about that. The

mare is certainly sure-footed; and, besides, you were ;

just now talking of galloping her to town.

S. VVell, then, to tell you the plain truth, though I
wish to oblige you with all my heart, my saddle is torn
quite in pieces, and I have just sent my bridle to be
mended. _

D. Luckily, I have both a bridle and a saddle hang-
ing up at home. *

S. Ah! that may be; but I am sure your saddle will
never ﬁt my mare. She ’s Very notional.

S. Clodpole’s! his will no more ﬁt than yours.
.D. At the worst, then, I will go to my good friend

I Squire Jones. He has half a score of them; and I

am sure he will lend me one that will ﬁt her.

S. You know, friend Derby, that no one is more
willing to oblige his neighbors than I am. I do assure
you, the beast should be at your service, with all my
heart; but she has not been curried, I believe, for
three weeks past. Her foretop and mane want comb-

her in her present '*plight, it Would ruin the sale of
her.

D. O! a horse is soon curried, and my son Sam
shall attend to it at once.

8'. Yes, very likely; but I this moment recollect the
creature has no shoes on.

D. Well, is there not a blacksmith hard by?

S. What, that tinker, Dobson? I would not trust
such a bungler to shoe a goat. No, no; none but
uncle Tom Thumper shall shoe my mare.

D. As good luck will have it, then, I shall pass right
by his door. a

S. [Calling to his 30%] Tim, Tim! here ’s neigh-
bor Derby, who wants the loan of the gray mare, to
ride to town to-day. You know the skin Was rubbed
off her back, last week, a hand’s breadth or more.
[Gives Tim a wink] However, I believe she is well
enough by this time. You know, Tim, how ready I am
to oblige my neighbors; indeed, we ought to do all
the good we can in this world. We must certainly let
neighbor Derby have her, if she will possibly answer
his purpose. Yes, yes; I see plainly, by Tim’s coun-
tenance, neighbor Derby, that he ’s disposed to oblige
you. I would not have refused you the mare for the
worth of her. If I had, I’ should have expected you to
refuse me in turn. None of my neighbors can accuse
me of being backward in doing them a kindness.
Come, Tim, what do you say?

T. What do I say, father? Why, sir, I say, that I
am no less ready than you are to do a neighborly
kindness. But the mare is by no means capable V» of
performing the journey. About a hand’s breadth, did
you say? Why, sir, the skin is torn from the poor
crcatui-e’s back, the bigness of your broad-brimmed
hat! And, besides, I have promised her, so soon as

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 227

she is able to travel, to Ned Saunders, to carry a load
of apples to market.

S. Do you hear that, neighbor? I am very sorry
matters are thus. I Would not have +disobliged you
for the price of two such mares. Believe me, neighbor
Derby, I am really sorry, for your sake, that matters
turn out thus.

D. And I as much for yours, neighbor Scrapewell;

for to tell you the truth, I received a letter this morn- I

ing from Mr. Griﬂin, who tells me, if I Will be in town
to-day, he Willgive me the refusal of all that lot ‘of
timber, which he is about cutting down, on the side of
the hill; and I had intended you should have shared

‘half of it, which would have been not less than ﬁfty

dollars in your pocket. But, as your

S. Fifty dollars, did you say?

D. Ay, truly, did I‘; but as your mare is out of
order, I ’ll go and see if I can get old Roan, the black-
smith’s horse.

S. Old Roan! My mare is at your service, neigh-
bor. Here, Tim, tell Ned Saunders he can’t have the
mare: Neighbor Derby Wants her; and I Won’t refuse
so good a friend any thing he asks for.

D. But What are you to do for meal?

S. My Wife can do Without it for a Week, if you

D. But then, your saddle is all in pieces. .

will eat, since she refuses hay.

S. She did, indeed, refuse hay this morning; but the

For them, no more shall rise
The evening moon, nor midnight stars,
Nor daylight’s soft +surprise:
They will not wake to tenderestcall,
Nor see again each home,
Where waiting hearts shall throb, and break,
When this day’s tidings come.

3. Two soldiers, lying as they fell
Upon the reddened clay-—
In daytime, foes; at night, in peace
Breathing their lives away!
Brave hearts had stirred each manly breast;
Fate only, made them foes;
And lying, dying, side by side,
A softened feeling rose.

“To-day we ’ve done our best

That this day’s work will break.

For soon before God’s mercy-seat
Together We shall bow.

And, right or Wrong, the morning sun
Will ﬁnd us, dead, the same.”

The dying hands entwine; '

The stars from heaven shine;
And the little girl with goldenihair,

Were fatherless that night! V

HUGH IDLE AND MR. TOIL.

1. HUGH IDLE loved to do only what was agreeable,

and took no delight in labor of any kind. But while i

Hugh was yet a little boy, he was sent away from
home, and put under the care of a very Strict school-
master, who went by the name of Mr. Toil.

2. Those who knew him best, aﬂirmed that Mr. Toil
was a very worthy character, and that he had done
more good, both to children and grown people, than
any body else in the world. He had, however, a severe
and ugly countenance; his voice was harsh; and all
his ways and customs were idisagreeable to our young
friend, Hugh Idle.

3. The whole day long this terrible old scl1ool—master
*stalked about among his schol_ars, with a big cane in
his hand; and unless a lad chose to attend constantly

and quietly to his book, he had no chance of enjoying ‘

a single quiet moment. “This will never do for me,”
thought Hugh; “I’ll run off, and try to ﬁnd my way
home.” i i

4. So the very next morning oﬂ' he started, with only
some bread and cheese for his breakfast, and very little
pocket-moneyeto. pay his expenses. ,He.had gone but

a short distance, When he overtook a man of grave
and sedate appearance +trudging, at a +moderate pace,
along the road.

5. “Good morning, my ﬁne lad!” said the stranger; .

and his voice seemed hard and severe, yet had a sort
of kindness in it; “whence do you come so early, and
whither are you going?”

6. Now Hugh was a boy of very frank disposition,
and had never been known to tell a lie in‘ all his life.
Nor did he tell one now, but confessed that he had run
away from school on account of his great dislike to
Mr. Toil. “O, very well, my little friend!” answered
the stranger; “then we will go together; for I likewise
have had a good deal to do with Mr. Toil, and should
be glad to find some place where he was never heard
of.” So they walked on very sociably side by side.

7. By and by their road led them past a ﬁeld, where
some hay-makers were at work. ‘ Hugh could not help
thinking how much pleasanter it must be to make hay
in the sunshine, under the blue sky, than to learn
lessons all day long, shut up in a ‘‘dismal school-room,
continually watched by Mr. Toil.

8. But in the midst of these thoughts, while he was
stopping to peep over the stone-wall, he started back
and caught hold of his companion’s hand. “Quick,
quick!” cried he; “let us run away, or he will catch us I ”

9. “Who will catch us?” asked the stranger.

10. “Mr. Toil, the old school-master,” answered
Hugh; “do n’t you see him among the hay-makers?”
and Hugh pointed to an elderly man, who seemed to be
the ownerof the ﬁeld.

11. He was busily at work in his shirt sleeves. The
drops of sweat stood upon his brow; and he kept con-
stantly crying out to his work-people to make hay
while the sun shone. Strange to say, the ’'features of
the old farmer were precisely the same as those of

0

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 233

Mr. Toil, who at that very moment must have been
just entering the school-room.‘

12. “Do n’t be afraid,” said the stranger; “this is
not Mr. Toil, the school—master, but a brother of his,
who was bred a farmer. He won’t trouble you, unless
you become a laborer on his farm.”

13. Hugh believed what his companion said, but was
glad when they were out of sight of the old farmer,
who bore such a singular resemblance to Mr. Toil.
The two travelers came to a spot where some carpen-
ters were building a house. Hugh begged his com-
panion to stop awhile, for it was a pretty sight to see
how neatly the carpenters did their work with their
saws, planes, and hammers; and he was beginning to
think he too should like to use the saw, and the plane,
and. the hammer, and be a carpenter himself. But
"suddenly he caught sight of something that made him
seize his friend’s hand, in a great fright.

14. “Make haste! quick, quick!” cried he; “there’s
old Mr. Toil again.” The stranger cast his eyes where
Hugh pointed his ﬁnger, and saw an elderly man, who
seemed to be overseeing the carpenters, as he went to
and fro about the unﬁnished house, marking out the
wo_rk to be done, and urging the men to be diligent;
and wherever he turned his hard and wrinkled visage,
they sawed and hammered, as if for dear life.

15. “O, no! this is not Mr. Toil, the school-master,”
said the stranger; “it is another brother of his, who
follows the trade of carpenter.”

16. “I am very glad to hear it,” quoth Hugh; “but
if you please, sir, I should like to get out of his way as

’ soon as possible.”

EXERCISES.-—TO whose school was Hugh Idle sent? ‘What
was the character of the school-master? Why did Hugh leave the
school? What did the stranger propose to Hugh? Give IIugh’s
adventure with the hay-makers. With the carpenters.

«HUGH IHDLE AND ME. TOIL-—CONCLUDED.

1. NOW Hugh and the stranger had not gone much
further, When they met a company of soldiers, gayly
dressed, with feathers in‘ their caps, and glittering
muskets on their shoulders. In front marched the
drummers and ﬁfers, making such merry music, that
Hugh Would gladly have followed them to the end of
the world. If he Were only a soldier, he said to him-
self, old Mr. Toil Would never venture to look him in
the face. ,

2. “Quick step! forward! march!” shouted a +gruﬂ"
voice. 1 X c 1
3. Little Hugh started in great dismay ; for this
voice sounded precisely like that which he had heard
every day in Mr. Toil’s school-room. And turning his
eyes to the captain of the company, What should he see‘
but the very image of old Mr. Toil himself, in an
oﬁicer’s dress, to be sure, ‘but looking as ugly and dis-
agreeable as ever. '

4. “This is certainly old Mr. Toil,” said Hugh, in a
trembling voice. “Let us away,‘ for fear he should
make us enlist in his company.”

THE ECLECTIC snnins. 235

5. “You are mistaken again, my little friend,” re-
plied the stranger very composedly. “This is only a
brother of Mr. Toil’s, who has served in the army all
his life. You and I need not be afraid of him.”

6. “Well, Well,” said Hugh, “if you please, sir, I
do n’t want to see the soldiers any more.’-’ So the
child and the stranger resumed their journey; and,
after awhile, they came to a house by the roadside,
Where a number of young men and rosy—cheeked girls,

. with smiles on their faces, were dancing to the sound

of a ﬁddle. ,

7. “O, let us stop here,” ‘cried Hugh; “Mr. Toil
will never dare to show his face where there is a
ﬁddler, and Where people are dancing and making
merry.”

8. But the Words had scarcely died away on the
little boy’s tongue, When, happening to cast his eyes
on the ﬁddler, Whom ‘should he behold again but the
likeness of Mr. Toil, armed with pa ﬁddle-bow this time,

and ﬂourishing it with as much ease and dexterity, as i

if he had been a ﬁddler all his life.

9. “O, dear me!” Whispered he, turning pale; “it
seems as if there Were nobody but Mr. Toil in the
World.”

10. “This is not your old school-master,’ observed
the stranger, “but another brother of his, who has
learned to be a ﬁddler. He is ashamed of his family,
and generally calls himself Master Pleasure; but his

5

real name is Toil, and those who know him best, think ,

him still more disagreeable than his brothers.” ‘
11. “Pray, let us go on,” said Hugh.
  12. Well, thus the two Went wandering along the
highway, and in shady lanes, and through pleasant
villages,;and Wherever they Went, behold! there Was
the image of old Mr. Toil. If they entered a house,
he sat in the parlor; if they peeped into the kitchen,

he was there! He made himself at home in every
cottage, and stole, under one disguise or another, into
the most splendid mansions. Every-where they stum-
bled on some of the old school—master’s ‘innumerable
brothers.

- - 13. At length, little Hugh found himself completely

worn out with running away from Mr. Toil. “Take
me back! take me back!” cried the poor fellow, burst-
ing into tears. “If there is nothing but Toil all the
world over, I may just as well go back to the school-
house.”

14. “Yonder it is; there is the school—house!” said
the stranger; for though he and little Hugh had taken
a great many steps, they had traveled in a circle in-
stead of a straight‘ line. “Come, we will go back to
the school together.” .

15. There was something in his companion’s voice
that little Hugh now remembered; and it is strange
that he ‘had not remembered it sooner. Looking up
into his face, behold! there again was the likeness of
old Mr. Toil, so that the poor child had been in com-

pany with Toil all day, even while he had been doing ‘

his best to run away from him.

16. Little Hugh Idle, however, had learned a good
lesson, and from that time forward, was diligent at his
task, because he now knew that diligence is not a whit
more toilsome than sport or idleness. And when he
became better acquainted with Mr. Toil, he “began to
think his ways were not so disagreeable, and that the
old school-master’s smile of approbation made his face
sometimes appear almost as pleasant as even that of
Hugh’s mother.

MY ‘MoTHER’s GRAVE.

1. IT was thirteen years since my mother’s death,
When, after a long absence from my native village, I
stood beside the sacred mound beneath Which I had
seen her buried. Since that mournful period, a great
change had come over me. I My childish years had
passed away, and with them my youthful character.
The World was altered, too; and as I, stood at my

‘mother’s grave, I could hardly realize that I Was” the

same thoughtless, happy creature, whose cheeks she so
often kissedin an excess of tenderness.

2. But the varied events of thirteen years had not
eﬂaced the remembrance of that mother’s smile. It
seemed as if I had seen her but yesterday--—as if the
blessed sound of her well-remembefred voice was in my

ear. The gay dreams of my infancy and childhood I‘

Were brought back so distinctly to my mind, that had
it not been for one bitter recollection, the tears I shed
would have been gewptleand refreshing.

3. The circumstahce may seem a triﬂing one, but
the thought of it now pains my heart; and I relate it,

that those children who have parents to love them,
may learn to value "them as they ought. My mother
had been ill a longtime, and I had become so accus-
tomed to her pale face and Weak voice, that I was not
frightened at them, as children usually are. At ﬁrst,
it is true, I sobbed violently; but When, day after day,
I returned from school, and found her the same, I began
to believe she would always be spared to me; but they
told me she would die. .

4. One day when I had lost my place in the class, I
came home discouraged and fretful. I Went to my
mother’s chamber. She was paler than usual, but she
met me with the same affectionate smile that always
Welcomed my return. Alas! when I look back through
the lapse of thirteen years, I think  heart must have
been stone, not to have been melted by it. She re-
quested me to go down stairs, and bring her a glassof

Water. I pettishly asked Why she did not- call a doe

mestic to do it. With a look of mild reproach, which
I shall never forget if I live to be a hundred years old,
she said, “Will not my daughter bring a glass of water
for her poor sick mother?”   A

5. I Went and brought her the Water, but I did not
do it kindly. Instead of smiling, and kissing her as I
had been Wont to do, I set the glass dovvn very ‘quickly
and left the room.‘ After playing a short time, I Went
to bed Without bidding my mother good-night; but
when alone in my room, in darkness and silence, I
remembered how pale she looked, and how her voice
trembled When she said, “Will not my daughter bring
a glass -of Water for her poor sick _,mother?” I could
not? sleep. I stole into her chamber to ask forgiveness.
She had sunk into an .»easy slumber and they told ‘me I
must not Waken her..   e   A  

6. I did not tell any one What troubled me, but stole
back to my bed, resolved to rise early in the morning,

THE IJCLECTIC snnrss. 241

and tell her how sorry I was for my conduct. The sun

was shining brightly when I awoke, and hurrying on

my clothes, I hastened to my mother’s chamber. She
was dead! She never spoke.’more—never smiled upon
me again—and when I touched the hand that used to
resti upon my head in blessing, it was so cold that it
made me start. i
7. I bowed down by her side, and sobbed in the
bitterness of myheart. I thought then I wished I
might die, and be buried with her; and old as I now
am, I would give worlds, were they mine to give, could

o my mother but have lived to tell me she forgave my

childish ingratitude. ButI can not call her back; and
when I stand by her grave, and whenever I think of
her manifold kindness, the memory of that reproach-
ful look she gave me, will bite like a serpent, and sting
like an adder.

Wearing yet on his pale, sweet face,‘
Soon to be hid’ by the dust of the grave,

The lingering light of his boyhood’s grace.

EXERCISE VI.

SENTENCES like the following may be often‘ read with great
advantage, for the purpose of acquiring distinctness and preci-
sion in articulation.

This act, more than all other acts, laid the am at the root
of the evil. It is false to say he had no other faults.

The hosts still stand in strangest plight. That last
still night. That lasts till night. On either side an
ocean exists-. On neither side a notion exists.

Among the rugged rocks the restless ranger ran. I
said pop-a-tar, not pop’lar. I said pire-tail, not pr’vail.
I said be-hold, not b’hold. ' '

Ilztnkst thou so meanly of my Pltocion? Hencqforth
look to your kearths. Canst thou minister to a mind
diseased? A thousand shrt'e7cs for hopeless mercy call.

T 0 TEAC H E R s.—The preceding exercises have been prepared
With much care, and, it is believed, will be found very useful in
aiding the teacher’ and pupil in this much-neglected department of
education. It must be ‘borne in mind that very much depends upon

V the teacher; that unremitting attention on his part is absolutely

necessary; that his voice must be the model for the pupil; and that
repeated and persevering practice is necessary, but will, with great
certainty, produce the desired result.

Bad habits in articulation are almostlalways formed in early ’

childhood, and very young children may be made to understand and
proﬁt by instruction on the subject. But, once more, let it be re-
membered that every thing in this matter depends upon the teacher.

1. HENRY BOND Was about ten years old “When his
father died. His mother found it '*di1‘ﬁcult to ‘“provide

for the support of a large ‘family, thus left entirely in

her care. By good management, however, she con-
trived to do so, and also to send Henry, the oldest, to
school, and to supply him, for the most part, with such

books as he "needed.   _

PREFACE.

—_.

THIS volume, the fourth in the remodeled series of the ECLECTIG
READERS, contains a large amount of primary matter, much of

which is new. The increased amount of such matter, contained in;

this and the preceding volumes of this series, it is believed, will be
found amply sufﬁcient to supply the deﬁciency which exists in other
Reading Books in this respect.

ARTICULATION and PRONUNCIATION are treated of systematically

and thoroughly in the introductory pages, and EXERCISES for prac-.
tice, numerous and varied, will be found interspersed between the
lessons.

EXERCISES in SPELLING and DEFINING are placed at the head of
the lessons, and are intended not only as valuable practice and
information for the pupil, but also as specimens of the manner in
which the lessons should be studied and recited. The teacher
should add to the list all important words.

Lessons on MARKS and PAUsEs, and on INFLECTION and ACCENT,
are contained in this volume. It is recommended that the attention
of the pupil be especially directed to these subjects, and that he be
frequently examined upon them. The QUESTIONS inythis, as in the
other volumes of the series, are intended to SUGGEST rather than
PRESCRIBE the method of examination. They can be varied at the
teacher’s pleasure.

The READING LEssoNs are drawn from a great variety of sources.
Many are translations. They have been extensively remodeled,
and some of them re-written. The names of the authors, from

whom they are derived, are therefore omitted, they not being re-

sponsible for them in their present form.

The present edition is considerably enlarged, the additional
selections being all new, and several of them relating to recent
historical events, of enduring interest to all Americans.

2. At one time, however, Henry wanted a ‘grammar,
in order to join a class in that study, and his mother
could not furnish him with the money to buy it. He
was very much troubled about it, and went to bed with
a heavy heart, thinking what could be done.

3. On waking in the morning, he found that a deep
snow had fallen, and the cold wind was blowing furi-
ously. “Ah,” said he, “it is an ill wind that blows
+nobody good.”   A

4. He rose, ran'to the house of a neighbor, and
oﬂered his service to clear a path. around his premises.
The offer was ‘accepted. Having "completed this
work, and ‘received his pay, he went to another place
for the same purpose, and then to another, until he
had earned enough to buy a grammar.

5. When school +commenced, Henry was in his seat,
the ‘happiest boy there, ready to begin the lesson in
his new book.

6. From that time, Henry was always the ﬁrst in
all his ‘'*classes. He knew no such word as fail, but
always "’succeeded in all he “*attempted. Having the
will, he always found the way.

ExERcIsEs.——What did Henry do to get a grammar? What
kind of a scholar was he? What kind of a man do you suppose
such a boy would make? -

T o TEAC H E R s .--Reading should be made a study-—not passed
lightly over, as is too -often the case in primary schools. One short
lesson a day, or part of -a lesson even, thoroughly practiced, is far
better than more, imperfectly treated. _ A

The exercisesin deﬁning, spelling, articulation, the questions upon
the subject. of ‘thelesson, and upon grammatical construction, may
be increased or varied at discretion, but not omitted. They are
merely given to illustrate the manner in which the book should be
used, in order to secure the full beneﬁt of reading as a study.

Not one word should _be passed over until it is perfectly under-
stood, correctly spelled, and distinctly articulated. Emphasis and
inﬂection should also receive their appropriate attention.

THE ECLECITIC SERIES. 33

The words. preceded by the mark 4', may be spelled orally. or
written on a blackboard, slate, or paper.

The daily practice of writing words is an important means of
ﬁxing their orthographical form in the mind of the learner.

 

ARTICULATION.

THESE Exercises, in connection with those in the Introduction,
should be frequently and carefully practiced. They form a com-
plete system on consonant sounds.

Utter, ﬁrst, the sounds composing. a syllable, and notthie names of
the letters; then, pronounce, the. syllable. .§e_e directions, Exercise
IV, page 15. Double letters must be sounded as single, and silent
letters dropped. The latter are often omitted altogether, as the e in
cobble, hobble, &c., where the bbl should be uttered as one sound.

1. MANY years ago, when there were but few White
men in this country, an ftlndian Went, in the dusk of
the evening, to a public-house in a small village called
Wilton. He asked the Woman to give him some drink

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 35

and a supper. At the same time, he said that he could
not pay for them, as he had had no ‘‘success in hunt-
ing He ‘promised, however, to pay her soon.

2. The woman told him that she had nothing for
him; called him a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow, and
said she did not work so hard, to throw away her
+earnings upon such +creatures as he was. ,

3. A gentleman who was sitting by, ‘‘observed that
the Indian was suffering from hunger and fatigue. As
the Indian turned to leave the house, the gentleman
told the woman to supply him with what he needed,
and said that he would pay her himself. She did so.

4. When the Indian had ﬁnished his supper, he
turned to the gentleman, thanked him, and told him
that he should remember his ‘kindness, and, whenever
he was able, would repay him.

5. Some years after, the gentleman set out to visit a
city at some ‘distance from Wiltonta In order to reach
it, he was ’*obliged to pass through. a wilderness. In
the woods, he was taken captive by an Indian party,
and carried to +Canada. ‘

6. When they arrived there, some of the Indians
advised that he should be put to death, and others,
that he should be kept as a ‘‘prisoner. In the "“mean-

time, he was bound, and kept safely, until they should

‘‘decide what to do with him. ’

7. One day, when most of the Indians were out
hunting, oneof them came to him, and unbound him.
He then gave him a musket and some powder, and a
bag with food in it, to strap on his back. Having
done this, the Indian told him to follow him.

8. They traveled, for many days, toward the South.
The Indian +preserved, all the time, perfect +silence.
In the day-time, they shot such game as came in their
way for food, and, at night, they kindled a ﬁre by
Which they slept.

36 NEW FOURTH READER.

9. After a "journey of many days, they came, one
morning, to thertop of a hill, from which they could
see a number of houses, forming quite a village. The
Indian asked the man if he knew that place. He
replied, very +eagerly, that it Was Wilton.

10. His guide then reminded him, that many years
before, he had ”’relieved the Wants of a Weary and
hungry Indian, at a public-house in that place, and
added, “I that Indian; novv I pay you; go home.”

11. Having said this, the Indian left him, and the
man ‘joyfully returned to his home.

2. Henry, ‘seeing how poor the dog looked, said,
“This animal is surely in great Want. As I think he

needs a dinner more than I do, he shall share: mine?’

3. Saying this, he gave the dog part of the food in
his basket, and Was pleased to see him eat as if he

had not tasted any thing for a +fortnight. After this,
the dog’ followed him, and fawned upon him, with the
greatest +gratitude.

4. Henry went on, until he saw an old horse lying
down, and groaning as if he was in the greatest ""dis-
tress. He went up to him, and saw that he was almost
starved, and unable to rise.

5. “I am much afraid,” said Henry, “that it will be
dark before I can return, if I stay to assist this horse.
However, I will ‘‘attempt to "“relieve him.” He gath-
ered some grass for the horse, then brought some
water in his hat, which s emed to “*refresh the animal
so much, that after a few trials, he got upland began
to graze. , i

6. Henry went on a little further, and saw a man
wading about in a pond of water. “What is the
matter, good man?” said the boy. “Can you not
ﬁnd your way out?” “No, my little friend. I have

fallen into this pond, and know not ‘how to get out I

again, as I am blind.”

7. “Well,” said Henry, “though I shall be Wet to

the skin, yet if you will lend me your stick, I will try  

to help you out.” The blind man then threw his stick
to that side on which he heard the voice. The boy
caught it and went into the water, feeling very +care-

, fully with the stick, lest he should go beyond his depth.

At last, he reached the blind man, and led him out in
safety. ,

8. After the blind man had thanked him, Henry ran
on quite fast, for stopping so often had made him late.
He had not gone far, however, when he saw a poor
scm'lor,”*‘hopping along upon ‘crutches.  

9. “My little friend,” said the sailor, “I have fought
many ‘a battle for my country, but now I am +crippled,
as you see, and have neither money nor food, though I
am almost starved.”

THE ECLECTICV SERIES 41

i 10. The little boy gave him all thefood that he had
left, and said, “I would be glad to help you more, poor
man, but this is all I have.” gHe then ran on, and after
he had done his errand, started for home. .

11. He had not gone more than half Way, before
night came on. He did all that he could to ﬁnd his
Way, but ‘“missed it, and came to a wood, where he
*wandered about a long time.

12. At length, tired out and hungry, he sat down
and began to cry most bitterly. While sitting there,
the little dog came up to him, wagging his tail, and
holding something in his mouth. Henry found it to be
a. cloth, +nicely pinned together, which somebody had
dropped. It contained several ‘slices of bread and
meat, which he ate, and felt much better. 1

13. “So,” said Henry, “I see that you have given
me a supper for the +b7*ea7cfast I gave. you.‘ A good
action is never thrown away, though done to-" a dog.”

He once more +tried to ﬁnd his way out of theowood, ,

but could not succeed.

14. He Was just giving up in ‘‘despair, when the saw

‘a horse feeding, and, going up to him, by the light of

the moon found it was the same he had fed in the

1 morning.

15. “Perhaps,” said he, “this creature will remem~
ber that I was kind to him, and will let me ride out of
the Wood upon his back.” Henry then Went up to the
horse, speaking to him and patting him. The gentle
animal let him» mount his back, and then went slowly
through the Wood, till they came to an opening which
led to the road.

16. “Ah!” said Henry “A GOOD ACTION IS NEVER
THROWN AWAY. If I hadnot saved the horse’s life this
morning, I should have been obliged to stay in ,the

‘E Wood all night.”

17. The poor boy had, however, a greater danger
before him. Ae he Was going through a lonely lane,
two men caught him, and began to strip him of his

"‘clothes. Just then the dog bit the leg of one of them’

so hard. that he left the boy, and ran after the dog.
18. At this instant, a Voice Was heard that cried

out, “There the rascals are! knock them down!”

This +frightened the other man so much, that he too

' ran away. Henry then saw that it Was the sailor

Whom he had “‘"relieved in the morning, borne upon the
shoulders of the blind man, Whom he had helped out
of the pond. . ,

19. “There, my little fellow,” said the sailor; “We
have come‘ in time to help you, in return for What you
did for us this morning. .

20. “As I lay under a ‘hedge, I heard these rascals
talk. of robbing a little boy, that I supposed must be
you. But? I was solame that I could not have come
sotn enough to help you, ix J. had not met this blind
man,’,who took me upon his back, While I showed him
the Way.” I o i

21. Henry thanked them both for their help, and
they all went together to his father’s house, Where the
sailor and the blind man were kindly received and fed.

22. The little boy took care of his faithful dog as
long as he lived, and never forgot that We must do
good to others, if We Wish them to do the same to us.

Henry meet ﬁrst? What did he do? What did he meet next?

1. “I HAVE a great mind to break this stupid old
slate,” said little Willie, one morning, as he sat over
his ﬁrst sum in subtraction.

- 2. “lWhy, What has the poor slate done?” asked the
pleasant Voice of his sister Grace, behind him.

 “Nothing. That is just What I lcgmplain of; it
Won’t do this sum for me; and here it is almost school-
time!”

.4. “What a Wicked slate, Willie!”

5. “So it is. I mean to ﬂing it out of the Window,
and break it to pieces on the stones.”

6. “Will that do your sum, Willie?” ,

7. “No; but if there were no slates in the World, I
shouldrhave no good—for-nothing sums to do!”

5‘ 8. “O ho! that does not follow by any means.
Did slates make the science of “‘arithmetic? Would
people never have to count and calculate, if there

Were no slates? You forget pens, +lead-pencils, ’

and paper; you forget all about oral arithmetic,
Willie.” ’  

9. ‘‘ Well, I do n’t love to lcipher ; thatjs all I know 7’.

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 47

10. “And so, you hasty boy, you get angry with the
poor, harmless slate, that is so useful when you make
‘mistakes, and want to rub them out again. ,

11. “Now, that is the way with a great many
+thoughtless, quick-tempered people. They try to ﬁnd
fault with somebody or something else, and get into a
passion, and perhaps do mischief, when, if they would
but +reﬂect a little, it is their own dear selves who
ought to bear the blame.

12. “Now, Willie, let me see what I can do for
you!” Willie came rather unwillingly, laid the slate
in her lap, and began to play with the ”'trimming on
her apron. I

13. “Why, what is all this?” said she; “'*soldiers,
and cats, and dogs, and houses with windows of all
shapes and ‘‘sizes!’’

14. Willie looked foolish. “O, the sum is on the

other side,” said he, turning it over. ,
' 15. “Ah, silly boy,” said Grace, “here you have
been sitting half an hour, drawing '-“pictures instead
of trying to do your sum! Now, my ‘little man, you
must goto work in good +earnest, to make up for lost
time!”

16. “O Grace, it wants only twenty minutes of
nine; I can’t "possibly do this -sum and get to school
by nine. I shall be late. VVhat shall I do? I shall
certainly be kept, if it is not done. Can’t you do it
for me, just this once, Grace?” -

17. “No,” said Grace.  
18. “O, do, my very dear, 1 good sister; just this
once.” . '

19. “No, Willie; there would be no kindness in
that. You would never learn arithmetic in that way.”

20. “Just once,” still pleaded Willie.

21. “No,” answered Grace, in a kind but *resolute

tone; “if I do it once, you will ﬁnd it harder to be  

48 NEW FOURTH READER.

*refused to-morrow. You will depend on. me, and sit
playing and drawing pictures, instead of ciphering. I
will do a much kinder thing. I will keep you close at
it till the sum is ﬁnished.”

22. So she put her arm gently round him, and
though Willie pouted at ﬁrst, and could hardly see
through his tears, she ‘questioned him about his sum,
and began to show him how to do it, yet letting him
work it out himself, in such a pleasant manner, that
he was soon ashamed of being sullen.

23. After all this was ﬁnished, ‘patiently and +dili-

gently, Willie was surprised to ﬁnd that he would still _

be in good season for school.

24. “Now, t0—morrow, Willie,” said Grace, “do not
waste a moment, but go to your lesson, and draw your
pictures afterward. This will save time and temper,
and you will not get into a passion with this nice old
slate of mine.   .

25. “When people complain, it is, half the time,
because they feel that they have done wrong.”

EXERCIS Es.—What did Willie want to do with the slate?
What did his sister say to him, and help him to do? What was the
real trouble with Willie‘? How can you always make study easy
and pleasant?

1. THE "monkey is a very cunning little "animal,
and is found in many’ parts of the World. H

2. A lady once had a monkey, which had been
‘brought to her as a present. This monkey, like all
others, was very fond of "‘mischief, and of doing What-
ever he saw others do.

3. His +mistress found him one day sitting on her
toilet-table, holding in one hand a little china mug
with Water in it, and in the other her’ tooth-brush,
With which he Was cleaning his teeth, looking all the
time in the glass.

4. Her little ‘“daughter Maria had a large doll, With
a very handsome head and face. She one day left
this doll in the cradle, and Went‘ out of the room.
The monkey came in, took the doll in his arms, and
jumping upon the Wash-stand, he began to Wash its
face. ,

5. He ﬁrst rubbed it all over With soap. Then

”seizing the towel, he dipped it in the Wash-bowl, and

rubbed it so hard that the doll’s face Was entirely
spoiled, the paint being all Washed 011'.

6. The monkey Would sometimes take a fan, and
fan himself. Once he was found Walking up and

’*parasol, belonging to one of the children.

7. The lady, going one day into her room, saw her
new hat Walking about the floor. She Was at ﬁrst
much *‘surprised, but in a moment she found that the
monkey was under it. He had taken it out of the
bandbox, and putting it on his head, it of course fell
all over him.

8. He was very much ‘frightened When he heard
his mistress coming into the room, and in trying to
get the hat oil", he tumbled over it, and rolled on the
ﬂoor,-entangled in the +ribbons, which he had quite
spoiled. The hat also Was very much broken and
hurt.

9. Fearful of being punished, as soon as he got out
of the hat, he jumped into the bandbox, to hide him-
self, and sat there. ‘trembling. But the lady, Who
could not help ilaughing, coaxed him to come out,
and made him understand that she Would not punish
him. ‘ 

10. A large number of monkeys will sometimes get
together, in the morning, in the Woods. One of them
will seat himself, and begin a speech, While the rest
Will keep silent.

11. When he has done, they all set up a shout, as
if for applause, and then the monkeys disperse.

And as the snuff got further in,

virtues. _One day, the “'Jewish elders came to him to
b-uy some diamonds, to put upon that part of the
dress of their high ‘priest, which the Bible calls an
*ephod.  

54 NEW FOURTH READER.

2. They told him what they Wanted, and olfered
him a fair ‘price for the diamonds. He replied that
he could not let them see them at that moment, and
‘‘requested them to call again.

3. As they wanted them without delay, and thought
that the object of the jeweler, Was only to '*increase
the price of the diamonds, the elders. offered him
twice, then three times, as much as they were Worth.
But he still +refused,’and they Went away in very bad
humor. , .

4. Some hours after, he Went to them, and‘ placed

.beforc them the diamonds, for which they again

offered him the last price they had named; but he

said, “I will only accept the ﬁrst one you oifered to

me this morning.” a .
5. “Why, then, did you not [close with us at once?”
asked they in‘ +surprise. “When you came,” replied
he, “my father had the key of the chest, in which
the diamonds were kept, and as he was asleep, I

should have been 5“obliged to wake him to obtain

6. “At his age, a short hour of sleep does him a

.1. JACOB had twelve sons. He loved one of them,
Joseph, very much, and made for him a coat of many
*‘colors. But Joseph’s brethren hated him, because he
was the "favorite of their father.

2. One day, when Joseph came to them as they
were keeping their ﬂocks in the ﬁeld, they took him,
and sold him to a company of “merchants, who were
going down into "‘Egypt. The merchants sold him
again to one of the king’s great men in Egypt.

3. While he was in this great man’s house, he was
unjustly thrown into +prison. Soon. after this, "Pha-
raoh, the king of Egypt, had a very strange dream.
No one could tell him thetmeaning of it, and he was
very much troubled on accountof it.

56 NEW FOURTH READER.

4. But the chief butler of the king told him that
there was a young man in the prison, who would
+eXplain his dream to him. He said, he knew that
he could, because he had explained a dream which he
had, when heiwas in prison; and that things had come
to pass, just as Joseph had said they would.

5. So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and the great God
told him what the dream meant; and he laid it open
to the king.

6. And the king said to him, “See! ‘I have set thee
over all the land of Egypt.” And he made him to
ride in the second chariot which he had. And they
cried before him, “Bow the knee!” And he made
Joseph ruler over all the land of‘ Egypt.

7. But his father, Jacob, who loved him so much,
knew not what had become of him. Indeed, his
brethren, whenthey had ‘sold him, took his coat of
manyicolors, and +dipped it in blood, and then showed
it to his father. And his father thought that some
wild beast had torn Joseph to pieces.

8. After some time, there was a great famine in the
land where Jacob lived. As there was plenty of corn
in Egypt, Jacob sent his sons there to buy some for
food. J

9. Joseph knew them, though they did not know
him. But he treated them as spies. They said, that
they were not spies, but that they were all the sons of
one father, and that they had left their brother +Ben-
jamin at home.

10. And Joseph. said, that he should know that they
were what they said, if they should bring their younger
brother with them, the next time they came. And
he took one of J them, to keep him till they should

1. NOW, Jacob Was very ‘'unwilling to let Benjamin
go. For, since he had “supposed that Joseph Was
dead, he had loved Benjamin the more.

2. But at last, as they Were much in -Want, he let
Benjamin go with them. ‘He said, “Go into Egypt
again, and carry a present to the man; a little
balm, and a little honey, spices‘ andsmyrrh, nuts and
‘almonds. Take also ‘your brother. And‘ God Al-
mighty give you mercy before the man, that he may
send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I
am bereaved of my children, I-am bereaved.”

3. And they Went, and they bowed themselves
before Joseph to the earth. And he said, “Is your
father Well, the old. man, of Wl1OII1 ye‘ spake? Is he
yet alive?” I ‘

4. And, ﬁxing his eyes on Benjamin, he said,_ “Is
this your\,c/ounger brother, of Whom ye spake to me?”
And he said, “God be ‘gracious to thee, my son!”

5. And he made himself known to his brethren.
He said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold
intoEgypt. Be not +grieved, nor angry with your-
selves that ye sold me hither; for God did send me
before you to ‘‘preserve life.”

6. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck,
and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. And
he kissed all his brethren, and wept with them- “ You
shall tell ‘my father,” said he, “of all my glory in
Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall
haste and bring down my father hither.”

7. They then went back into the land where their
father lived, and they told him that Joseph was alive,
and governor over all the land of Egypt. And they
repeated all the words which Joseph had said to them.

8. But J acob’s heart fainted within him. He thought
that it was too good news to be true, and he did not
‘*believe them.

9. When, however, he saw the wagons which Jo-
seph had sent to carry him down into Egypt, he
took +courage. He said, “It is enough. Joseph,
my son, is yet alive. I will go and see him before
I die!”

10. And so he did, and all his family of +seventy
persons went with him. ' '

11. When Joseph heard that he was coming, he
made ready his chariot, and went to meet him, and he
fell on his neck. And he wept on his neck a good
while.. And Jacob said, “Now let me die, since ]
have seen thy face, and thou art yet alive!”

7. Once there was a ship in a storm. Some of her
masts were already broken, and her sails lost. While
the wind was raging, and the billows dashed against
her, the cry was heard, “A man has fallen +over-
boardl” ‘

‘8. Quickly was the boat ﬂowered, and she was soon
seen bounding on her way over the “mountain waves.
At one moment, the boat seemed lifted to the skies,
and the next, it sank down, and appeared to be lost
beneath the waves. A .  

9. At length, the man was found. He was well-
nigh drowned; but he was taken on board, and now
they made for the ship. But the ship rolled so +dread-
fully, that it seemed certain death to "go near her.
And now, what should they do?

10. The captain told one of the men to go aloft and
throw down a rope. This was made fast to the boat,

A and when the sea was calm a little, it was ‘ihoisted up,

and all fell down into the ship with a dreadful crash.
It was a desperate way of getting on board; but +fort-
unately no lives were lost.

11. Take it all in all, a sailor’s life is a very-hard
one. Our young friends owe a debt of gratitude to
those whose home is upon the great waters, and who
bring them the luxuries of other countries.

12. Good men have built many chapels for seamen
on shore. A great deal has been done for them, that
their stay on shore may be pleasant, and that they
may learn what is useful to them.

18. A few Weeks after this, Mr. Jones gave each of

19. John. How is this, fen? These tops have no
strings. VVhat shall we do for strings?

20. Ben. I have a string that will do very well for
mine. And he pulled it out of his pocket.

21. John. Why, if that is not the whip—cord! I
wish I had saved mine.

22. A few days afterward, there was a p+shooting-
match, with bows and *arrows, among the lads. The
prize was a ﬁne bow and arrows, to be given to the
best imarksman. “Come, come,” said Master Sharp,
“I am within one inch of the mark. I should like to.
seewho will go nearer.” ‘

23,. John drew his bow, and shot. The arrow
struck within a quarter of an inch of Master Sharp’s.
“ Shoot away,” said Sharp; “. but you must understand

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 65

the rules. We settled them before you came. You
are to have three shots with your own arrows. No-
body is to *borrow or lend. So shoot away.”

24. John +seized his second arrow; “If I have any
luck,” said he ;——but just as he ’“pronounced the word
“luck,” the string broke, and the arrow fell from his
hands.

25. Master S/tarp. There! It is all over with you.

26. Ben. Here is my bow for him, and welcome.

27. Master S/carp. No, no, sir; that is not fair.
Did you not hear the rules? There is to be no

‘ lending.

28. It was now Ben’s turn to make his "trial. His
first arrow missed the mark; the second was exactly

as near as John’s ﬁrst. Before +venturing the last '

arrow, Ben very prudently examined the string of
his bow; and, as he pulled it to try its strength, it
snapped. I

29. Master Sharp clapped his hands and danced for
joy. But his dancing suddenly ceased, when careful
Ben drew out of his pocket an excellent piece of cord,

' and began to tie it to the bow.

30. “The everlasting whip-cord, I declare!” cried

.John. “Yes,” said Ben; “I put it in my pocket to-

day, because I thought I might want it.” p

31. Ben’s last arrow won the prize; and when the
bow and arrows were handed to him, John said,
“How ‘Valuable that whip-cord has been to you, Ben.
I’ 11 take care how I waste any thing, hereafter.”

had a ‘Mlesign in it; (and you told me that you had

all the beautiful and convenient things which you see
around you. I mean HIM who is God, the Lord, and
+oWner of all things, and Who should be "Worshiped by

29. “But, father, is not this garden yours? and that
house, and all things around us here?”

30. “No, my son,” replied Mr. VVashington, “they
are not mine. True, I call them mine, and they are
mine to use, rather than my +neighbor’s; but they are
only intrusted to my care. All things belong to God.
He created them, and they are his. But He has given
the care of them to his Icreatures here, and Will one

31. “But, father,” said George, “you built your
house, did n’t you? And is it not‘ yours, then?”

32. “Yes, George; but if I did build it, did I create
the ’'materials of it? Who made the trees, from which
the timber, the boards, and the ‘‘shingles were obtained?
Whence did the iron come, from which the nails were
made? God formed all. ‘And it was He, too, Who
formed the oxen, and the horses, and the sheep, and
every thing Which you see on the farm.”

33. George now became silent, and appeared for a
time lost in the reﬂections of his own mind. A good
impression had been made. He seemed to feel the
force of his father’s remarks. From this time, it is
believed, he never ‘doubted that there Was a God, the

1. I WILL tell you about the ““laziest boy you ever
heard of. He was indolent about every thing. When
he played, the boys said he played as if the teacher
told him to. When he went to school, he went creep-
ing along like a snail. The boy had sense enough;
but he was too lazy to learn any thing.

2. When he spelled a word, he +draW1ed out one
syllable after another, as if he were afraid the +sy1la-
bles would quarrel, if he did not keep them a great
way apart.’ .

3. Once when he was “*reciting, the teacher asked
him, “What is said of *“Hartford?’’ He answered,
“Hartford is a *ﬂourishing comical town.” He meant
that it was. a “ﬂourishing commercial town ;” but he
was such a drone, that he never knew what he was
about. .

4. When asked how far the River +Kennebec was
navigable, he said, “it was navigable for boots as far as
"Waterville.” The boys all laughed, and the teacher
could not help laughing, too. The idle boy +colored
like scarlet.

5. “I say it is so in my book,” said he. When one
of the boys showed him the book, and pointed to the

78 NEW FOURTH READER.

place Where it was said, that the Kennebec was
navigable for boats as far as Waterville, he stood with
his hands in his pockets, and his mouth open, as if
he could not understand what they were all laugh-
ing at.

6. Another day, when the boys were reciting a lesson

E in deﬁning, he made a mistake Worse than all the rest.

The Word A-CEPH’-A-LOUS was printed with syllables
divided as you see. The meaning given of the Word
Was, “Without a head.”

7. The idle boy had often been laughed at for being
so slow in saying his lessons.   This time, he thought
he would be very quick and smart. So he spelled the
Word before the teacher had a chance to put it out.
And how‘ do youthink he spelledit?

8. “A-C-E-P-H, ACEPH,” said he, “a louse without a
head.” The boys laughed at him so much about this,
that he Was obliged to leave school. The teacher
said, “he was a drone, and the Working bees stung
him out of the hive.” /

9. You can easily guess what luck this idle boy
had. With all his father’s care to have him learn, he
would be a Tdunce; not because he was a fool, but
because he was too lazy to give his thoughts to any
thing. , '

10. He had some fortune left him. But he was too
lazy to take care of it, and now he goes about the
streets, begging his bread. He often Wishes that he
had‘ been more "attentive to his books, when young.
But he can not live over again the time he has spent

so badly, and he_ must be a poor +ignorant fellovv for

the rest of his life. i

1. “WHAT an ‘excellent thing is knowledge‘,” said
a sharp-looking, bustling little man, to one who was
much older than himself. “Knowledge is anexcellent
thing‘,” repeated he. “My boys knowfmore‘ at six
and seven years old than I did at twelve. They can
read all sorts of books, and talk on all sorts of sub-
jects. The world is a great deal wiser than it used

to be. Every body knows something of every thing

now. Do you not think, sir, that knowledge is an
excellent thing’?”

30 s NEW FOURTH READER.

2. "‘ Why, sir,” replied the old man, looking gravely,
“that. depends ‘entirely upon the use to which it is
“applied. It may be a blessing or a curse. Knowledge
is only an ‘increase of power, and power may be a
bad as well as a good thing.” “That is what I can
not understand,” said the bustling little man. “How
can power be a bad thing?”

3. “I will tell you,” meekly replied the old man;
and thus he went on‘: “When the power of a horse
is under restraint, the "“animal is useful in bearing
burdens, idrawing loads, and "carrying his master;
but when that power is unrestrained, the horse breaks
his bridle, dashes to pieces the ‘“carriage that he draws,
or throws his rider.” “I see!” said the little man.

4. “When the water of a large pond is ““properly
conducted by trenches, it renders the ﬁelds around
fertile; but when it bursts through its banks, it sweeps
every thing before it, and ”“destroys the produce of the
ﬁelds.” “I see!” said the little man, “I see!”

5. “When the ship is steered aright, the sail that
she hoists +enables her sooner to get into port; but if
steered wrong, the more sail she carries, the further

jvill she go out of her-course.” “I see!” said the

little man, “I see clearly!”

6. “Well, then,” continued the old man, “if you
see these things so clearly, I hope you can see, too,
that knowledge, to be a good thing, must be rightly

applied. God’s grace in the heart will render the

knowledge of the head a blessing; but without this, it
may prove to us no better than a curse.” “I see! I
see‘!” said the little man, “I see!”

  1. THE lion is from three to four feet high, and '
from six to nine feet long. His strength is very

great. He can easily break the skull of a horse by a
stroke of his paw. A large lion can drag oﬂ' an ox...

84 NEW FOURTH READER.

2. The color of the lion is a "yelloWish red. He
roams about in the forests of Africa and Asia, and is
a terror to man and beast. The lion can be ltamed,
if taken young, and will even show marks of kindness
to his keeper. But it is ‘dangerous folly to get into
hispower.  

T3. In a menagerie‘ at Brussels, there was a cell
Where a large lion, called *Danco, used to be, kept.
The cell happened to be in need of repair, and the
keeper, Whose name was William, desired a carpenter
to come and mend it. The icarpenter came, but was
so afraid of the lion, that he Would not go near the
cell alone. i

4. So William fentered it, and led the lion to the
upper part of it, While the other part was reﬁtting.
He played with the lion for’ some time; but, at last,
being Twearied, both he and the lion fell asleep. The

carpenter went on with his work, and when he had ﬁn-
ished it, he called out for William to come and see it.

5. He called again and again, but no William an-
swered. The poor carpenter began to be ‘frightened,
lest the lion had made his dinner of the keeper, or
else crushed him with his great paws. He crept
round to the upper part of the cell, and there, looking
through the ‘“railing, he saw the lion and William,
sleeping side by side, as +contentedly as two little
brothers. V , T

6. He was so +astonished, that he uttered a loud
cry. The lion, awakened by the noise, stared at the
carpenter with an eye of fury, and then, placing his
paw on the breast. of his keeper, as if to say, “touch
him if you dare,” the heroic beast lay down to sleep
again. The carpenter was ‘idreadfully alarmed, and
not knowing how he could rouse William, he ran out
and ‘‘related what he had seen. ‘

7. Some people came, and opening the door of the
cell, contrived to awaken the keeper, who, rubbing his
eyes, quietly looked round him, and expressed himself
very well +satisﬁed with his nap. He took the lion’s
paw, shook it kindly, and then retired +uninjured from
the cell. A  

8. The lion sometimes lives to a great age. One

by the name of Pompey, diedat London, in the year s

1760, at the age of seventy years.

9. The lion roams about in the forests of Asia and
Africa. He utters a roar which sounds like thunder.
He stays in places where other “animals are wont to
come for food and drink. When one of them is near
enough, he springs upon it with a furious bound.

strength can the lion perform? What is the color of the lion‘?

[N 0 T E.——Mr. Barlow one day invented a play for his children,
on purpose to show them what kind of persons and professions are
the most useful in society, and particularly in a new settlement.
The following is the conversation which took place between himself

, and his children.]

Mr. ‘Barlow. Come, my boys, I have a new play for
you. I will be the founder of a colony; and youshall
be people of +diﬁ'erent trades and professions, coming

to offer yourselves to go with me. What are you, i

Arthur ? .

Arthur. I am a farmer, sir.

Mr. Barlow. Very Well. Farming is the chief thing

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 

we have to depend upon. The farmer puts the seed
into the earth, and takes ‘care of it when it is grown
to ripe corn. Without the farmer, we should have no
bread.’ But you must work Very ‘diligently; there
will be trees to cut down, and roots to dig out, and a
great deal of hard labor. a

  Arthur. I shall be ready to do my part.

Mr. Barlow. Well, then I shall take you +willingly,
and as many more such good fellows as I can ﬁnd.
We shall have land enough, and you may go to work
as soon as you please. Now for the next.

James. I am a miller, sir.

Mr. Barlow. A very useful trade! Our corn must
be ground, or it will do us but little good. But What
must we do for a mill, my friend? r

VJames. I suppose we must make one, sir.

M7‘. Barlow. Then we ‘must take a mill-wrighlwith .

us, and carry mill—stones.   Who is next?

Charles. I am a carpenter, sir.

Mr. Barlow. The most +necessary man that could
offer. We shall ﬁnd you Work enough, never fear.
There will be houses to build, fences to make, and
chairs and tables beside. But all our timber. is grow-
ing; we shall have hard Work to fell it, to saw boards

and planks, and to frame and raise buildings. Can‘

you helpin this?
Charles. I will do my best, sir.
Mr. Barlow. Then I engage you, but I advise you

to bring two or three able +assistants along with you.

W7£llz'am. I am a blacksmith. a

Mr. Barlow. An +excellent companionfor the car-
penter. We can not do without either of you. You
must bring your great bellows, "anvil, and “‘vise, and
we will set up a forge for you,ias soon as we arrive.
By the by, we shall want a mason for that.

But you will have no ladies’ hair to curl, or gentlemen
to powder, I assure you.

Ilfr. Barlow. Then, sir, you are very welcome; we
shall some of us be sick, and we are likely to get cuts,
and ‘bruises, and broken bones. You will be very
useful. We shall take you with pleasure.

Mr. Barlow. Sir, your most obedient servant.
When we are rich enough to go to law, we will let
you know.  

Oliver. I am a ischool-master.

Mr. Barlow. That is a very respectable and useful
profession; as soon as our children are old enough, we
shall be glad of your services. Though we are hard-
working men, we do not mean to be ignorant; every
one among us must be taught reading and writing.
Until we have employment for you in teaching, if you
will keep our accounts, and, at present, read sermons

' to us on Sundays, we shall be glad to have you among

us. Will you go?

Oliver. With all my heart, sir.

Mr. Barlow. Who comes here?

Philip. I am a soldier, sir; will you have me?

Mr. Barlow. We are +peaceable people, and I hope
we shall not be obliged to ﬁght. We shall have no

Jllr. Barlow. This may be all very well, and quite
to your fancy, but I would suggest that we, in a new
colony, shall need to pay more attention to the raising

  of corn and ’"potatoes, the feeding of cattle, and the

preparing of houses to live in, than to the *cultivation
of this elegant “science,” as youterm it.

John. I, sir, am a ‘lpolitician, and would be willing
to edit any newspaper you may wish to have published
in your colony. ‘

Mr. Barlow. Very much obliged to you, Mr. Editor;
but for the present,eI think you may wisely remain
where you are. We shall have to .labor so much for
the ﬁrst two or three years, that we shall care but
little about other matters than those which concern
our farms. We certainly must spend some time in
reading, but I think we can obtain +suitable books for
our +perusal, with much less money than it would re-
quire to support you and your newspaper. I

do us? . I

Robert. I intend to spend most of my time in walk-
ing about, and ‘“overseeing the men at Work. I shall
be very willing to assist you with my advice,. Whenever
I think it necessary. As for my support, that need
not trouble you much. I expect to shoot game enough
for my own eating; you can give me a little bread,
and a few ‘Vegetables; and the barber shall be my
servant.  

Mr. Barlow. Pray, sir, why should we do all this
for you? i I I

5. “There, there!” ‘exclaimed John, “that comes of
your throwing it all to one side.” “As if I could
make the wind blow “straight,” said Lucy. In the
meantime, I ‘went to the kite’s assistance; and having
disengaged the long tail, I rolled it up, saying, “Come,

as "busy as bees, at a small table near the ‘window.
James was ‘trigging a boat, and Albert was ‘tpainting

and sails proper for it.

father ‘slipped into the room, and taking a seat at the
furthest corner, heard the following dialogue:

5. James. Albert, can you tell me those lines which
old Ben, the sailor, made about the boats, when We
went to the +sea-side with father? ‘

6. Albert. It is so long since  have said them, that
I am sure I do not know; but I Will try. Let me

“The yawl and the +jolly-boat.”

No; that’s Wrong, the yawl comes in the second line.
How do they begin?

“The long—boat, the jol1y—boat,
The pinnace and the yawl;
The skiff and the water-boat,
Ship-boats we call.

Is the best thing that ﬂoats.”

93 NEW FOURTH READER.

I say, Albert, do n’t you think that the best thing
father and mother could do,“ would be to send us to
sea? H Why, we are half sailors now. 2

12. Albert. Yes, we know that the ”"sterrl is the hind
part of the ship.  

13. James. And that the stem is the fore part.

14. Albert. That the keel is the bottom piece of.

timber, on which the ship is built.
2 15. James. That the masts are those long beamsor
posts, to which they ﬁx the sails.  

16. Albert. That the '*bowsprit is a mast which stands
out from the head of a ship.

17 . James. That the "starboard is on the right hand,
when looking toward the head of a ship. _

18. Albert. And that the +larboarcl is the left hand.

19. James. That to +wez'gh “lanchor is to heave or
drag it from the bottom of the sea; that the rudder is

, that “*instrument, which is placed at the stern, and

which, by being moved this way or that, by the helm

or handle, guides the course of the ship through the

water.
 20. Albert. That a ibuoy is a ﬂoating cask, which is
made fast by chains and anchors, to show where the

water is ‘‘shallow, and where rocks and sand-bars are,

or any thing else of danger.

21. James. Yes, thanks to old Ben, we know all
these; and then, how pleasant it would be to see the
whale, which is called the king of the sea. 7

22. Albert. And the shark, the boldest of all
ﬁshes. .

23. James. And the saw-ﬁsh and sword-ﬁsh. ~

24'. Albert. Yes, indeed; or to make a voyage to
*Peru, for gold and silver. 2

25. James. Or to the East Indies and China, for

+cloves, +nutmegs, silks, muslins, tea, and many other i

nice things.

26. Albert. Or to the West Indies, for bananas,
sugar, and coffee.

27. James. Or to +France and *Spain, for wine,
*oranges, lemons, *”almonds, and ‘raisins.

28. Albert. Yes, yes; this is all very‘ pleasant to
talk about, but it would not do quite so well, I fancy.
Sailors have to bear many hardships. What a sad
account that was, which father read to us the other
day, about the poor fellows that were ten days at ‘sea

in a boat, and were nearly starved before they Were .

picked up, as they call it.

29. James. O dear, Albert, I can not bear to think
of it. How kind we ought to be to sailors When they
come home. I am sure, I will do all I can for them.

30. Albert. Hark! there is some one singing in the
street; and see, it is a poor old sailor; he has but
one leg; now then, out with your little box, and be as
good as your word. 3 y

31. James. That I would; but, alas! I gave my last
cent this morning to the poor little sweep, who has
neither father nor mother. What shall I do?

32. Just then, their father came forward and said:

“My dear boys, for the last ten ”"minutes I have been I

in the room; and you do not know what pleasure it
gives me to see so much kindness, and to ﬁnd that
your young minds are so well stored with useful

knowledge. Here is some money for your little box;-

go, and ‘“relieve the poor sailor; and then, as your
boats are ready, we will walk to the brook, and your
brother will launch them.’

H 1. “BEG‘, Frisk’, beg‘,” said little Harry, as he sat
on an inverted basket, at his grandmother’s door, ‘leat-

“ing, with great satisfaction, a +porringer of bread and

milk. His little sister Annie, who had already dis-
patched heri+breakfast, sat on the ground *‘opposite
to him, now twisting her ﬂowers into garlands, and
now throwing them away.

2. “Beg‘, Frisk’, beg‘!” repeated Harry, holding a

bit of bread just out of the dog’s reach; and the "

+obedient Frisk squatted himself on his hind legs, and
held up his fore paws’, waiting for master Harry to
give him the tempting morsel‘. '

3. The little boy and the little dog were great
friends. Frisk loved him dearly, much better than
he did any one else; perhaps, because he '*‘recollecté<l

THE ECLECTIC SERIES. 101

that Harry Was his “earliest and ﬁrmest friend during
a time of great trouble.

4. Poor Frisk had come as a stray dog to Milton,
the place Where Harry lived. If he could have told
his own story, it Would probably have been a very
pitiful one, of kicks and cuffs, of hunger and foul
Weather.

5. Certain it is, he made his "‘appearance at the
very door Where Harry" was now sitting, in "‘mi"s‘”e”rable
+plight, Wet, dirty, and half-starved; and that there he
met Harry, who took a fancy to him, and Harry’s
+grandmother, Who drove him off with a broom.

6. Harry, at length, ‘obtained ‘“permission forthe
little dog to remain as a sort of out-door pensioner,
and fed him With stray bones and cold ‘potatoes, and
such things as he could get for him. He also ‘pro-

i vided him with a little basket to sleep in, the very

same Which, turned up, afterward served Harry for a
seat. , A
7. After a While, having piifvled his good qualities

by barking away a set of pilferers, who were making
an attack on the great pear-tree, he was admitted into)‘

the house, and becgmﬂe one of its most vigilant and
‘valued inmates.  could fetch or carry either by
land or Water; Would pick up a thimble or a ball of
cotton, if little Annie should happen to drop them;
or take Har_'ry’s dinner to school for him with perfect
"honesty. " ' 1 c
8. “Beg, Frisk, beglﬁj‘ said Harry, and gave him,
after long waiting, the ‘expected morsel. Friskwas
‘satisﬁed, but Harry was not. The little boy, though
a good-humored fellow in the main, had turns ‘of
naughtiness, which Were apt to last himall day, and

c this promised to prove one of his Worst. It Was a

*holiday, and in the afternoon, his cousins, Jane. and
William, were to come and see him and Annie fand
