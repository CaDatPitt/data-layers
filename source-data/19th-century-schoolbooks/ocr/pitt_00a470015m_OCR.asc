vi PREFACE.

The Author is indebted to the Hon. John Perkins, of
Louisiana ; G. W. Randolph, John Presser Tabb, MD. ;
Rev. Messrs. Phillips and Gatewood, of Virginia; and
to others, for valuable aid in commencing the series

of Which this volume is the forerunner.

In acknowledging his obligations to preceding
Authors, he would state that it has not been his object
to depart either from the facts or the Words of the
best Geographers, except Where greater conciseness

might be gained.

78 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

Forests are numerous, and furnish timber, pitch, potash,’
and turpentine in abundance. Fur-bearing animals abound.
along the borders of the Arctic Ocean. Corn, rye, and barley
are among the important products. The most extensive
iron-Works of Russia are near Lake Onega. Fruits ﬂourish
in the south, and cattle are numerous in every part of the
empire. , T

The people are chieﬂy of the Sclavonic race. The Tarta.rs
inhabit the south-east part of the empire.

Much attention has been given of late to internal improve-
ment in the constructing of railroads. By means of canals,
the seas, lakes, and rivers of the empire are united i11to
a. complete system of internal navigation. By means of the
canal which connects the Oka with the Don, at Tula, there is
an uninterrupted Water communication between the Caspian
Sea and the Sea of Azov. - r

Manufactures are on the increase ; among the most impor-
tant articles are glass, metal-Wares, hempen fabrics, and
leather. The foreign trade of Russia consists in the exchange
of her native products,——such as t-allow, hides, corn, iron,
hemp, furs, and timber, for the luxuries and ﬁner manufactures
of other countries. -

ST. PETERSBURG, the capital, is built partly on islands at the
mouth of the river Neva, and partly on the adjacent main-
land. The communicationbetween the diﬁerent parts of the
city is kept up, during the summer, by bridges of boats ; and
by the ice in winter, at which time the boats are removed.

t is the chief commercial city of the empire, and is noted
for it_s spacious streets, and its lofty and elegant buildings.

The oldest and perhaps the most noted structure in St.
Petersburg, is the small hut in which Peter the Great dwelt,
while superintending the building of the city. It is novv
covered with a brick building, to preserve it from the effects of
the weather.

.. ARCHANGEL is the chief seaport of the northern provinces of

Russia.

"RUSSIA. 7 9

ASTRACHAN is the centre of the maritime commerce of Russia
with the countries of Western Asia. It is also the chief seat
of the ﬁsheries of the Caspian Sea and the Volga.

SEBAstro:PoL is a strongly fortiﬁed seaport town of Southern
Russia. The entrance to the harbour (1,300 yards in width)
is defended by strong batteries placed at the extremity of the
two points of land that form the north and south horns of the
bay. It was the station for the Russian ﬂeet in the Black Sea.

0 ODESSA is the southern emporium of Russian commerce.

WARSAW, the ancient capital of Poland, has lost much of its
former importance since the downfall of Polish independence ;
though it is still the great entrepot of trade for Russian Poland.»

Moscow is a large city, and the centre of a great inland
commerce. It is the favourite residence of the wealthiest and
most ancient noble families of the empire.

 

LAPLAND, a cold and barren country of Northern Europe,
belongs partly to Russia, and partly to Sweden. The esti-
mated area is about 150,000 square miles. .

The climate is so cold in winter that water is often frozen in
the vessel, as a person is in the act of drinking it ; but in the

summer (which is very short) the heat is sometimes as great‘

as in ‘countries situated some 15° or 200 farther south. In the
parts north of the Arctic Circle, the sun is constantly visible

- for a number of weeks about midsummer, and invisible for

nearly the same period about Christmas. The Laplanders live
chieﬂy in tents, and are clothed with the skins of the reindeer
and other animals.

-— Their habits are frequently dirty and repulsive; but many

of them are now partially engaged in agricultural or trading
occupations.

The entire population is loosely estimated at 60,000; of
whom 9,000 are Laplanders, and the remainder Norwegians,
Swedes, and Russians.

Among the animals of Lapland, the reindeer is the most
valuable to the inhabitants. Indeed, it. forms almost their

80 A enosnxrny FOR BEGINNERS.

entire wealth. Its milk and ﬂesh affords them excellent
food; its sinews are made into thread; its horns into glue,
and also into spoons and other domestic utensils; and its
skin into clothing. Of these useful creatures a wealthy Lap-
lander possesses 1,000 or more, and the poorer people, from
50 to 100. With a couple of reindeer attached to a small
light sledge, a Laplander will travel 50 or 60 miles a day.

 

ASIATIG RUSSIA consists of two parts: 1st, the Caucasian
Provinces, between the Caspian and the Black Sea, the
greater part of which is known by the name of Georgia ; and
2nd, Siberia.

Georgia is a mountainous country, except its centre, which is

traversed by the river Kur. Its products are grain of various
kinds, pomegranates, and other fruits, madder, ﬂax, hemp, cotton
and wine. The Georgians are a remarkably handsome race.

, Siberia occupies the entire northern part of the Asiatic
Continent. Its extreme length is about 8,600 miles, and its
breadth about 1,800 miles. It is a Russian penal colony.

 

RUSSIAN AMERICA has an area in square miles of about

450,000. The estimated population is 61,000. It is an
extensive, though but little known region, lying in the north-
west part of North‘ America.

In the south-east part there is a chain of mountains, of
which Mount St. Elias and Fairweather are the loftiest peaks.

Between the mountain range and the sea, the land, in some

parts, is low and marshy.

The soil is sterile, and theclimate exceedingly cold. Fur-
bearing animals abound, also ﬁsh. Grain is produced in the
south in very small quantities, and here and there a few trees,
mostly pines and birches, are found on the hills.

The inhabitants are chieﬂy Esquimaux and Indians. In
consequence of the fur-bearing animals with which Russian
America abounds, it has attracted at various times the com-
mercial enterprise of several of the nations of the earth.

RUSSIA. 8 1

The ALEUTIAN IsLEs consist of several- groups lying be’-
tween the Peninsula of Alaska and the Asiatic Continent.
They are rocky, and, for the most part, volcanic, and their
number is not known. They belong to Russia. -

The inhabitants (about 9,000) are a mixture of the Mongol
Tartars and the North American Indians.

They are skilful ﬁshers and hunters, and in pursuit of the
sea-otter will undertake voyages of 1,000 miles in length from
island to island in their fragile ba,z'clm'es—-a kind of light boat”,
composed of the skins of animals, drawn tightly over a frame-'
work of Wood, or of 'ﬁsh—bones. Each boat is made to hold
one person, who sits in a round hole, just ﬁtted to the size of
his body. In summer, the inhabitants live in huts; and, in
Winter, in spacious excavations of the earth, roofed with turf,
each of which is capable of accommodating from 50 to 150
persons. A

SECTION XXIX.——Em'o]9ecm T turkey an-cl Greece.‘

, TURKEY. .
Area (of Turkey) in square miles, 210,000. Population, 12,500,000.

A chain of mountains, the Balkan, traverses the central part
of Turkey, from which a diverging branch passes south into
Greece. The other principal mountains are the Carpathian,
on the northern frontier, and the Dinaric Alps in the north-
West. The remainder of the surface is an undulating region
of hills and valleys. V

The soil is exceedingly fertile; but only a small portion is
cultivated, and the climate in the north is changeable, While in
the south it is generally Warm and pleasant. The climate,
‘however, is not as mild as might be supposed from the geo-
graphical position of the country."

Rice, cotton, and barley, are cultivated in the central‘ and

elevated districts; grapes, ﬁgs, olives, oranges, and other
fruits, are plentiful in the south. In the Principality of Servia,
tobacco, hemp, and ﬂax, are grown in large quantities.
Turkey is noted for its abundance of opium and rhubarb.
Trout are plentiful in the rivers, and the marshes abound
with leeches, which form, an‘ important article ‘of export.

Goats are more abundant here than in any other country in.

Europe. The southern base of the Balkan range is remark-
able for the abundance of its roses, from which the celebrated
attar, or otto, of roses is distilled. , A _ p

- The Turks, though but a small part of the population, are

the ruling people. The remainder of the population is mainly

composed of Greeks, Armenians, and Jews.

_ The females of Turkey, when they appear in the streets, are
so mufﬂed and veiled that they cannot be recognized. Both
men and women sit, eat, and sleep on the ﬂoor on cushions, or
sofa mattresses and carpets.

Very few of the roads are practicable for carriages; and
horses, or mules, are generally employed, both for the convey-=
ance of passengers and of goods. There are neither canals
nor railroads in the country. The Danube is the great high-
way of commerce for all the northern provinces.

The manufactures of Turkey are chieﬂy those of carpets,
silks, and Turkey leather. The commerce of the country con-p
sists principally in these articles, and in its various products in
their natural state, particularly drugs and fruit.

CONSTANTINOPLE, the capital both of European and of Asiatic
Turkey, is built on a tongue of land on the west side of
the Strait of Bosphorus, andon an inlet, or bay, of the same,
known as the “ Golden Horn.” 1

The general aspect of the city, when approached by water, is
exceedingly beautiful ; but it is found, on examination, to con-
sist of a perfect labyrinth of narrow, winding, steep, and -dirty
streets. The houses are generally built of wood, and present
dead walls to the street ; light and air being derived from
interior court-yards.

EUROPEAN TURKEY. AND GREECE. 83

The most noted public buildings are the Seraglio, or
Imperial Palace, situated at the eastern extremity of the city;
and a Mohammedan mosquerformerlyp the church of St.
Sophia.

ADRIANOPLE, the second city of Turkey in population, is
situated in one of the most‘ fertile plains in the World. .Its
mosques and public baths are numerous.

SALoN1oA is, next to=Constantinople-, the most commercial
city of European-Turkey. It stands on a hill slope, and is
surrounded by a lofty-whitewashed-.Wall, -ﬁve miles incircuit. ,

GREECE.
Area in square miles, 18,500. Population, 1,000,000. Prefectures, 10.

The greatest extent of Greece, from north-to south, is about
200 miles. ,

The chief divisions of the kingdom are.Northern Greece, or
Hellas, lying north of the Gulf of Lepanto ; thepeninsula of
the Morea, connected with the mainland by the Isthmusvof
Corinth; and various islands scattered over the greater -part
of the Grecian Archipelago.

The surface is mountainous, interspersed with ﬁne Valleys,
and a few plains of limited extent.

The soil is fertile in the valleys, and the climate is Warm
and delightful. The winter is short. In March the olives
bud, and the almonds are in blossom ; and in Maythe grain. is
reaped. Much attention is paid to the culture of the olive
and the vine.

The chief productions are grains, rice, cotton, ﬁgs, dates,
pomegranates, citron, oranges, &c. Bees are abundant, and
the produce of honey is very great. Sheep and goats are
numerous. T The ﬂesh of the goats is‘ used for food, and their
skins are made into Vessels for holding Wine,‘ oil, honey, and
other liquids.

The inhabitants are the mixed oﬁspring of the descendants
of the ancient Greeks, ‘ and of various nations of Sclavonic
origin. A large proportion are shepherds. _

84 A GEOGRAPHY non BEGINNERS.

There are few roads in the interior of the country.

The exports are mainly currants, cotton, olive oil, valonia (a
species of acorn used by tanners), drugs, and dried fruits.

ATHENS, the capital,situated in a small plain near the Gulf
of Egina, is chieﬂy celebrated for the numerous remains of its
former Works of art. Of its existing antiquities, the most
celebrated is the Acropolis, or citadel, which crowns the
summit of a lofty hill, in the midst of the city.

It contains the remains of the ancient Parthenon, or Temple‘
of Minerva. To the West of this is the Areopagus, or Mars’
Hill, the spot from which the Apostle Paul_ addressed the
assembled multitude of ancient Athens.

This city is also noted as having been the birth-place of the
most illustrious sages, philosophers, Warriors, and poets of
ancient times. About twenty miles to the north-east of Athens’
are the village and plain of lVIarathon, celebrated for the great
victory gained by the Athenians over their Persian invaders‘
(13.0. 490). - i

PATRAS, on the Gulf of Patras, is the principal seat of the
foreign trade of Greece.

Area in square miles, 259,300. Population, 37 ,850,000. Provinces, 16.

This empire comprises Germ_an Austria, Galicia, or Austrian
Poland, Hungary, and Venice.

German Austria includes the following provinces, viz. :—
Bohemia, Silesia, Moravia, Archduchy of Austria, Styria,
Illyria, and Tyrol.

AUSTRIA. 85

- The province of Gralicia, in the north-east section of Austria,
Was formerly a part of the Kingdom of Poland.

Hungary, Transylvania, Sclavonia, Croatia, the Military
Frontier, and Dalmatia, are comprehended under the general
name of the Hungarian Countries. »

Austrian Italy formerly comprised the Lombardo-Venetian.
Kingdom on the south side of the Alps, but is now restricted
to Venice only. The greater part of the Lombardo-Venetian-i
kingdom Was ceded to Sardinia in -1859. '

The surface of Austria is considerably diversiﬁed. It is
traversed by the Alps, Carpathian  and other mountain
ranges. In the Hungarian countries are extensive plains
and marshes. I

The soil is generally good, and the "climate cool and clear in
the north, but moist, Warm, and frequently cloudy in the south.

‘In the low parts of the empire, particularly about the Danube,

the heat in summer is very great.

Grain, ﬂax, hemp, rice, olives, vines, hops, tobacco, and a
great variety of fruits, are among the chief agricultural pro-
ducts. Leeches are numerous in the marshy districts of the
empire. In minerals, Austria ranks among the richest of -the
countries -of Europe. - ‘ .

The inhabitants ...belong to four principal families :——The
German, Sclavonian, Italian and Hungarian, or Magyars. Agri-
culture, mining, and the raising of sheep form the leading
pursuits.» I .

Roads, commodious for travelling and commercial purposes,
have been constructed across upwards of sixty of the mountain
passes of the empire. From" Pavia, in Italy, an. uninter-
rupted ovzaacaclarvmzed road, of more than 1,100 miles in length,-‘
leads, across mountains and rivers, to the eastern part of
Gralicia. I — I

Besides these, there are numerous other highways, and
several railroads, which connect the capital not only with
nearly all the cities of note in Northern Germany, but with_
the two great seaports of the~Adriatic. The Danube and its

86 A GEOGRAPHY   FOR BEGINNERS.

navigable tributaries form the great a commercial highway of
the empire. 1

Silk, wool, cotton, glass, ﬂax, and paper are among the chief
articles manufactured ; but Austria is not noted as a manu-
facturing country. The leading exports are corn, wine, wool,
minerals, timber, hides, porcelain, glass, leeches, and cattle.

BOHEMIA is a fertile plain, enclosed by mountains, and con-
tains an area of about 20,000 square miles. Bohemia is much
celebrated for its glass-works, as well, as for various branches
of mining industry.

Prague, the capital, is, next to Vienna, the most important
city in the German Provinces of Austria.

Austrian, Silesia contains an area of about 2,000 square
miles.  r  
MORAVIA contains an area of about 10,000 square miles. 0

Brunn, the capital, is the chief seat of the woollen manu-
factures of Austria. This city was the headquarters of
Napoleon before the battle of Austerlitz. The town of Auster-
litz, historically notedfor the battle of the 2nd of December,
1805, lies about 14 miles to the east of Brunn.

The ARGHDUGHY of AUSTRIA contains an area of about 15,000
square miles, and is divided into two parts, by the river Enns.
The eastern half is called Lower Austria, and thewestern,
Upper Austria.

VIENNA, the capital of the empire, is the great centre of
inland commerce, and the chief manufacturing city. It is
surrounded by a wall 40 to 50. feet high, and is entered by
12 gates.

Among the public buildings are the Cathedral of St. Stephen,
the Imperial Palace, the Custom House, and the University.
Vienna is noted for its ﬁne public walks and parks ; the chief
of which is the Prater, on an island in the Danube. It con,-.
sists of a natural forest, laid out in long paths, and contains
deer-parks, coﬁ”ee—houses, &’c. This park is crowded with
pedestrians and splendid equipages on fete days. Three fairs
are annually held at Vienna.

AUSTRIA. 87-

STYRIA comprises within its limits an area of about 9,000
square miles. Grratz, the capital, situated on an affluent of
the Drave, is extensively engaged in the transit trade between
Trieste and Vienna.

ILLYRIA. contains an area of about 10,000 square miles.
Mining is a chief object of industry. Laybach is the capital.-
This city carries on an extensive trade betWe.en’Germany and
Trieste. 1 0 * ' 1 1

TRIESTE is the chief commercial city of German Austria, and
the great seat of the foreign commerce of the entire" empire.
This cityxcommunicates ‘with the sea by means of a canal-,
which enables large vessels to penetrate’ within the very heart
of the city. Ship-building is here carried on to a great
extent. a

TYROL embraces .a territory of about 11,000 square miles.

It is a pastoral country, and the chief wealth of the inhabi--
tants is in their cattle and other live stock. 1 ‘In many parts. of
the valley of the Inn, canary birds are extensively reared, and
exported to various. parts of Europe‘. Innspruck, on the Inn,
is the capital of the Earldom of Tyrol. ‘

GALIGIA contains an area of about 34,000 square miles. The
inhabitants pay great attention to the rearing of cattle and
other live stock. Gralicia and Hungary are noted as being the
two principal corn-growing provinces of the empire. _

Lemberg, the capital of Gralicia, is noted for its January
Fair, which lasts six Weeks. Large quantities of furs are
brought here by the Russians from Siberia and Tartary, and
exchanged for the hardvvareand Woollen and cotton goods of
Austria. ' ' '

HUNGARY includes six provinces. These form a total area of

127,000 square miles, and embrace a population of about
14,000,000. 

The surface of Hungary presents very diversiﬁed regions
and climates. The north-West, north, and north-east parts are

traversed by the Carpathian Mountains, between Which‘ and

extensive marshes. -

In the valleys of the north, snow falls as early as September,
and seldom disappears before the middle of June, While in the
south, it is so mild that the finest species of grapes which
Europe possesses thrive Well. . '

With the exception of France, Hungary produces a greater
quantity of wine than any other country in Europe. Tobacco
is extensively. grown‘ in various parts of thekingdom, and
forms an important article of export. Hungary is noted for its
breed of horses, and for its immense numbers of -swine and
black cattle. The salt mines are very productive.

Italy was formerly divided into various states, under different.
rulers, comprising the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Iiombardo-f
‘Venetian Kingdom, the States of the Church, the Kingdom
of Naples, together with the Island of Sicily, the Lipari Isles,
the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and the Duchies of Modena and
Parma. .

In 1860, the Italian people, instigated by the patriot Gari-
baldi, chose the King of Sardinia for their sole ruler, under
the title of King of Italy. .

The surface of the country is generally mountainous, though
there are some level districts in the north and West.

90 so A GrEOGRAPHY:FOR BEGINNERS.

- Thesoil is remarkable for its fertility, and the climate is
Warm and delightful. Iron, lead, alabaster, lava and marble
are found in considerable quantities. “ Sponges and corals are
furnished along the coasts of Sicily. The Neapolitan pro-
vinces are noted for their grapes and other fruits;

The Italians, like the Greeks, are not one of the primitive
tribes of Europe, but are a mixed race, descendants of Greeks,
Germans, Gauls, &c. Agriculture forms the leading pursuit.

In Sardinia, Lombardy, and Tuscany, the roads are gene-
rally good; but in Central and Southern Italy they are very
defective. '

In the north there are -numerous passes over the Alps, by
which ‘communication is carried on with France, Switzerland,
and Germany. "Mules are generally used for purposes of
transport, over these and the other mountain roads of Italy.
The principal cities in the north are connected by railroads.

Silk is extensively manufactured; straw hats, artiﬁcial
ﬂowers, and musical instruments, are among the other leading
articles fabricated. . A L

The chief exports are raw silk, kid and lamb skins, olive
oil, straw hats, wines, fruits, coral, anchovies, cheese, and
perfumery. The raw silk is chieﬂy supplied to France and
England. A

Sardinia embraces several states or provinces, viz.:—-
Piedmont, which extends from the crest of the Alps and the
Apennines on the North and South into the great plain of
Lombardy on the east ; Genoa and Nice, two small provinces
which border on the Mediterranean, south of Piedmont, and
the Island of Sardinia, in the Mediterranean. "

TURIN, the present capital of Italy, is situated in a
delightful valley on the left side of the River Po. It ranks
first among the cities ‘of Italy, in the number and importance

of its scientific and literary institutions.

Genoa, the capital of the Duchy of Genoa, is the chief sea.-
port and naval arsenal.
Lombardy, an important province of Italy, previous to 1859

ITALY;  1

formed part of the Austrian dom_inions. Its chief city, Milan, is
noted for its cathedral, one of the grandest specimens of archi-
tecture extant ; and for its being the largest book-mart in Italy.

VENICE, a strongly fortiﬁed and important maritime city
belonging to Austria, is built on 72 small islands, which are
joined together by 306 bridges. These islands lie in the
midst of extensive lagunes, which are partially separated from
the sea by a narrow strip of ﬁrm sand.-

The chief thoroughfares are canals, of which there are 149‘;
and the communication between different parts of the city is

almost universally carried on by means of small, light boats,

called gondolas.
The Canal Grrande, which separates the city into two nearly
equal portions, is spanned by the bridge of the Rialto.

V ROME, the capital of the ancient Roman Empire, is
governed by the Pope, and is noted for the number and splen-
dour of its churches. St. Peter’s Cathedral -is the most
magniﬁcent ecclesiastical structure in the world. It covers
nearly ﬁve acres. Adjacent to it is the Vatican, a palace
belonging to the Pope. It is an immense building, having
more than 4,000 apartments. Venetia and the Pontiﬁcal
States are now the only portions of Italy not included in the
Italian Kingdom. , '

The province of Naples, the Island of Sicily, and the Lipari
Isles, form the southern portion of the peninsula.

Naples, situated on the north-west side of a bay of the
same name, is the most populous city in Italy. A

Tuscany, a small but fertile province, lies along the Medi-
terranean coast, north of the Papal dominions.

Florence, the chief city, is celebrated for its splendid collec-
tions of works of art, both in sculpture and painting.

Leghorn is the principal seaport of Italian commerce. Ship-

  building is extensively carried on there.

slope gradually towards the Mediterranean. '0

The soil is generallyfertile, but there are extensive Waste
lands. In the north the climate‘ is temperate. Here the
apple-tree ﬂourishes, the hills are clothed with forests, and the
yalleys yield rich h_arvests_ of corn; but the high plateaux of
the centre are destitute of trees, and the climate is noted for
itsdryness. In the south the climate is Warm; and here the
inhabitants cultivate the ﬁg, the olive, the vine, and the sugar-
cane. Fruits are abundant. , 0

The Spaniards are a mixed race, mainly composed of the
Celtic, Gothic, Roman, and Arabic. There are about 50,000
gipsies in different parts of Spain. Agriculture, and the rear-
ing of sheep, form the leading pursuits; and great attention is
paid to the culture of the grape. _

Wlieel carriages are but little used, and mules furnish the
chief means of transport. _ _

There are few railroads, or bridges, andithe rivers have
generally to be forded; but there are several canals.

The manufactures are silks, leather, ﬁre—arms, saltpetre,
an'd gunpowder. The exports are wines, brandies, oil, fruits,
Wool, silk, barilla, quicksilver, lead, and salt. Neither agri-
culture, manufactures, nor commerce, are in a ﬂourishing
condition. ’

constructed chieﬂy of earth and clay, and usually protected in
the more exposed parts by a facing of wicker-work formed of
Willows interlaced together.

The soil is fertile’, andthe climate mild and humid. The
Winters, however, are generally severe. The productions are
similar to those of Belgium. Cattle are numerous, and of
a large size. Dairy-husbandry‘ is brought to great perfection,
and immense quantities of butter and cheese are made.

The inhabitants are chieﬂy Dutch, and belong to the Ger-

man stock. There are, also, numerous Jews in the kingdom.
More attention is paid to the rearing of live—stock, and to the
produce of the dairy, than to tillage. Windmills are much
used for motive power. _
V ' The trade is carried on by means of canals, which in
Holland serve the purposes of roads. They run through the
principal streets of the cities, and extend a complete network
over the entire surface of the kingdom. " There are also rail-
roads, which connect the cities of Rotterdam, Haarlem,
Amsterdam, Utrecht and Arnheim.

all of Prussia; a part of Denmark (consisting of the Duchies
of Holstein and Lauenberg); and the Duchy of Luxemburg
(belonging partly to Holland and partly to Belgium) ; besides
29 independent states and 4 free cities.

The general government -of the -Confederation consists of an
assembly called the Diet, composed of representatives from
the several states. These representatives, or plenipotentiaries,
meet at Frankfort. Each state exercises a sovereign and
independent power over its own territory, and has its own
capital city.

Each state is bound to furnish its quota of men for the
general army of the Confederation. The Emperor of Austria
is the President of the Germanic Diet. _

The character of the governments in these numerous states
varies considerably, but most of them are constitutional
monarchies, in which the power is divided between the sove-
reign and a legislative chamber; and in some there are two‘
chambers, forming an upper and a lower house. A

The surface of Denmark is low and level. In some parts

‘ the coast is protected from inundations of the_ sea by dykes.

The "soil near the coasts is generally good, but in the interior
there are large tracts covered with heath. The climate is
humid, and subject to thick fogs, but is mild for its latitude.

Wheat and cats are extensively cultivated in Holstein and
Lauenburg. Geese, ducks, and other birds are numerous——--
their feathers forming an important article of traﬂic. Fish
supply the inhabitants near the coasts with a great part of
their food. Peat is the principal fuel. The pastures of
Denmark are its chief source of Wealth.

The inhabitants (called Danes), belong to the Teutonic or
German family of nations. Agriculture forms the leading
pursuit. A

The roads in Zealand and the other islands are generally

good, but in other parts of Denmark they are poor. Railroads

have been introduced to a limited extent-

There are three channels of communication between the
North Sea and the Baltic, besides the passage round the north

PRUssIA.
Area in square miles, 108,000. Population, 16,330,000. Provinces, 8.

Prussia consists of two distinct territories, lying about
40, miles apart, and separated from each other by the King-
dom of Hanover and the Electorate of Hesse Cassel.

The territory east of Hanover is called East Prussia. It is
divided.into six provinces——Prussia Proper, Posen, Silesia,
Saxony, Brandenburg, and Pomerania.

The territory. lying along the banks of the Rhine, west of
Hanover and Hesse Cassel, is styled West Prussia. It is
divided into Westphalia and the Rhenish Province.

The surface is generally level, and forests cover a large
portion of the country. I

In the Rhenish Province, and also along the Vistula, Oder,
and Elbe Rivers, the soil is fertile: in other parts it is not
naturally productive. The climate on the borders of the
Baltic is changeable, raw, and foggy; but, in Rhenish Prussia,
it is Warm enough to produce excellent wine. '

The productions are grain, hemp, ﬂax, hops, and tobacco.
Amber is found on the shores of the Baltic, and is largely

I exported to Turkey, where it is used for mouth-pieces of pipes,

and for other ornamental purposes,

Great quantities of beet-root are grown, for the purpose of
making sugar. Sheep and bees are extensively reared. The
raising of swine, particularly in the provinces of Westphalia
and Pomerania, is largely carried on; and the hams, bacon,
and sausages made from them form agreat part of the animal
food of the people. Mines of copper, iron, and lead are worked
to some extent. ‘

' The inhabitants are chieﬂy Germans, but in some parts of
Eastern Prussia they are mostly of Sclavonic origin. Jews are

numerous in nearly all. the cities and towns. About three-
fourths of the inhabitants are engaged in the cultivation of the
soil. ‘ ~

Railroads extend through almost every part of Prussia.
Berlin is thus connected with Hamburg, Stettin, Breslau,
Dresden, Leipsic, Bremen, Cologne, Brussels, Antwerp,
Ostend, Paris, Le Havre, Boulogne, and several other cities
of Continental Europe. The rivers aﬂbrd great facilities for
inland navigation.

The lea_ding manufactures are linen and woollen goods. The

exports are corn, timber, wool, and manufactured goods. The
inland commerce of Eastern Prussia is chieﬂy with Austria
and Russia. From the former the Prussians receive salt and
wine, and send linen-yarn in exchange ; from the latter,hemp,
tallow, hides, &c., and send linen and woollen goods.
_ BERLIN, the capital, is an important city of the kingdom.
The principal street, about a mile in length, is divided into ﬁve
avenues by rows of trees; and is lined on either side with
splendid palaces and public buildings. It is noted for its Royal
Library and its University.

STETTIN is, next to Dantzic, the most important seaport of
Prussia. Dantzio, on the western branch of the Vistula, is
the chief city for foreign commerce. _ ,

The chief characteristics of the surface of Switzerland’ are
its towering mountains and vast glaciers; its beautiful lakes
and smiling valleys; and its numerous Alpine streams and
glittering water-falls. A v

The soil is fertile in the valleys ; and the climate is cold on

the mountains, temperate on the plains, and hot in valleys.

Flax and hemp are extensively grown, but the chief part of the
wealth of Switzerland consists in its excellent pastures, which
afford support to immense numbers of cattle. The vine grows

- in the valleys.

Of the domestic quadrupeds, the Alpine spaniels are much
celeb-rated. These large dogs are trained by the monks of the
Convent of Great St. Bernard* to the task of seeking out
travellers who may have lost their way on the mountain, or
been benumbed by the cold, or partially buried by an avalanche.
They are furnished with the means of renderingassistance to
the wayfarer, by a basket of provisions fastened round the
neck, and they accomplish their mission with wonderful
sagacity.

Mineral springs are numerous, and many of them are much
resorted to by invalids.

The Falls of Schaffhausen in the River Rhine and the
Cataract of Staubbach are much celebrated. The latter, about
36 miles south—east of Berne, is formed by a tributary of the
River Aar, and falls from a perpendicular height of 850 feet.

The inhabitants are mainly of Teutonic and Celtic origin.
The cows, goats, and sheep, which form the wealth of the
Swiss farmer, derive their support from the grass which grows
on the mountain sides. In summer the cattle are attended on
the mountains by herdsmen, who live in chalets, or rude log-

huts, to which the persons whose business is to milk the cows

* There are several names by which Lake Asphaltites is distinguished;
as lake Bitumen, or Asphaltites, Salt Sea, lake Sirbon, Bahheret-Lut,
or Sea of Lot, Dead Sea, and, anciently, Sea of Sodom. It is situated in
Palestine, and receives the river Jordan on the north, and several other
smaller rivers ; but sends not, like other lakes, a tribute to the ocean;
The Waters of this lake are uncommonly transparent, and unusually salt.

Sulphur and bitumen are found on its shores, and large quantities of.

asphaltum, or mineral pitch, float on its surface. This celebrated sea
has recently been thoroughly explored by an American exploring party,
under the command of Commodore Lynch of the Confederate States
Navy.

JAPAN IsLANns. .

The Japan Islands, the chief of which are Ni’phon, J es’so,
Sik’okf, and Kiu’siu, lie between 30° and 46° N. lat; and
between 129° and 150° E. long. Length, about 1,000 miles;

breadth, from 50 to 200 miles. Extent, 270,000 square.

miles. Population, 25 millions. ‘The Japan Islands are not
fertile naturally, but they have been rendered exceedingly pro-
ductive by the industry of the inhabitants, who have introduced
every vegetable which can contribute to their own comfort or
the ornament of the country. Gold, silver, and copper are
found in great abundance; iron is more rare. In most of
their manufactures the inhabitants of Japan rival the Chinese,
to whom they bear a considerable resemblance; they excel
particularly in the art of varnishing. They are an intelligent,
enterprising people, and are said to be better educated than
any other nation in Asia; but they are extremely jealous of
foreigners.‘ They have two“ sovereigns; the one temporal,
whose capital is J eddo, and the other spiritual, who resides at
Miaco. There are also two systems of religion, Boodhism,
and a kind of polytheism.

The natives of Australia and New Guinea are a kind of
Negroes, and live almost like wild animals. In Australia are
some very curious creatures, as the kangaroo, which leaps ﬁfty
feet at a bound; the emu, which resembles the ostrich; a kind
of swan which is black; the menura, which has a tail shaped
like a harp; and the platypus, which has fur and four legs,
yet lays eggs, and has a bill like a duck.

_ ARABIA.
Area of Arabia in square miles, 834,000. Population, 12,000,000.

The surface of the country is generally low along the coast,
but the interior forms a series of high plateaux, mostly desert.
There are no rivers or forests, properly so called, in Arabia.
Springs partly supply the place of the former. I

In the valleys of the coast mountain region the soil is fertile.
The climate is generally hot and the driest in the World. The
year is divided into two seasons—the Wet and the dry ; but in
some parts the dry season is prolonged during the entire year.

Among the plants of Arabia, coffee holds the first place;
olives, almonds, ﬁlberts, dates, tamarinds, and various gums
and drugs are produced in some parts in abundance.’ The
horse and the camel of Arabia are highly esteemed.

The Arabs raise a sort of coarse millet, which forms their
chief article of food; the other grains, except oats, are also
cultivated to a limited extent. In feeding their horses, they
use barley and beans, instead of cats.

The Arabs are divided into two classes, the dwellers in the

what resembling our Indians. Many of them are gentle and friendly,

While others are ﬁerce and savage. In general, the climate is delightful. ,

Some of these islands produce the bread=-tree, which yields a kind of
large fruit used for bread.

The Sandwich Islands are an interesting group, and the natives have
been chieﬂy converted to Christianity by missionaries. The people have
adopted many of the arts of civilized life, and appear to be very happy.
Other missionaries have also been successful in introducing true religion,
and the arts of peace, among the natives of other groups of the Poly-=
nesian Islands. A - ' ‘

towns, and the inhabitants of the desert; the latter are called
Bedouins. They live -in tents and lead a Wandering life. There
are several tribes in Arabia, each independent of the others,
and ‘governed by its own sheila, or chief.- The leading object
of industry is the raising of camels, horses, goats, sheep, &c.-

The caravans of pilgrims and other travellers Who cross the
Arabian deserts must buy the protection of the various tribes
through whose territories they pass,- as the only means of
securing themselves against robbery and loss of life.

There are regular halting-places in the deserts,.where the
tents of travellers are pitched and the camels rest after their
day’s journey,———the ordinary length of which is from twelve
to fourteen miles. _ _ .

The exports are coffee, dates, gum-arabic, myrrh, aloes, —and
various drugs ; but coffee is the staple article of commerce.

MECCA is celebrated as being the birth-place of Mohammed,
and pilgrims annually resort to it, in caravan.s,Afrom every part
of the Mohammedan World. _ .

_ These different caravans bring with them the-various pro-
ductions of the countries from which they come,.and, on the
completion of the religious ceremonies- of the joui-'ney,.they
engage in trade. . ' I A

MUscAT, the largest city in -Arabia, is the chief emporium of
trade between Persia, Arabia, and India, .and the capital of a
state of the same name, which is governed by a, sovereign
called the Imaum, or Sultan. Medina is noted as ‘beingithe
burial-place of Mohammed.

ADEN belongs to the British, and is occupied by the
Indian Government as a depot for the supply of coal to the
packet-steamers. For this purpose, immense quantities" of

coal are sent thither.»-

AsIAr1:c TURKEY.
Area in square miles, 437,000. Population, 11 ,000.000.

Asiatic Turkey is divided into several smaller countries;
the = chief of these are Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, a part» of
8

114 A GEOGRAPHY FOR -BEGINNERS.

Armenia, and Syria. Palestine, or the Holy Land, is the
southern part of Syria. _ ‘

The surface of Asia Minor is mountainous, with high table-
land in" the interior, and rich plains along the sea-coast. In
Armenia the surface is a succession of high mountain-chains
and elevated valleys; in Mesopotamia much of the land is
desert; and in Syria the western part is mountainous and the
eastern an elevated plain.

The soil is generally very fertile, and the climate cold and
humid in the mountainous regions, but warm and delightful in
the plains and valleys. The productions are various, both in
the vegetable and animal kingdom. 

Grain, cotton, coffee, tobacco, and a great variety of delicious
fruits, are abundantly produced. The date-palm furnishes an
important article of food.

The population is of a mixed character, embracing Turks,
Greeks, Syrians, Jews, Arabs, Armenians, &c. Agriculture
receives but little attention. In Asia Minor considerable care
is bestowed upon the rearing of live-stock.

Among the productions of Turkish industry are caps of silk
and gold thread, silk sashesand cords ; silk-gauze shirts, veils,
and cloaks; slippers, tassels, turbans, divan-covers, and nume-
rous other articles, of a highly ornamental character.

The exports are raw silk, cotton, goat’s hair, raisins, and
other dried fruits, dye~woods, a variety of drugs,‘ and some
articles of native manufacture.

SMYRNA is a seaport of Asia Minor, and the chief commercial
emporium of Western Asia. This city has a ﬁne appearance
when viewed from the sea, but its houses are chieﬂy of wood,
and only one story in height ; andits streets are narrow and

dirty. Baths and mosques are numerous. Earthquakes are

not unfrequent, and the plague often visits Smyrna.

CAUCASIA.
Population estimated at 2,000,000.
Caucasus, or the Caucasian region,-is the name given to
those portions of the Russian empire situated near the Cau-

CAUCASIA. 1 1 5

casian mountains. They comprise the provinces of Caucasus,
Circassia, Daghestan, Georgia, Abasia, Mingrelia, Imeritia,
Shirvan, and Russian Armenia ; but much of these regions is
independent. of Russia. Agriculture and the rearing of cattle
are the chief sources of support to the inhabitants.

The Georgians are a handsome race, and the beauty of their
females is no less celebrated than that of the Circassians, who
inhabit a neighbouring province on the north side of the Cau-
casus Mountains. ,

Teflis, the capital of Georgia, is an important seat of trade,
and is noted for its hot baths. A

PERSIA.
Area. in square miles, 450,000. Population, 9,000,000.

The interior of Persia is an elevated plateau, a large portion
of which is desert. Water is scarce. The soil of the (table-
lands is barren, but that of the valleys is very fertile. “In the
north, the climate is cool ; in the south, particularly along the
Persian Gulf, the heats of summer are almost insupportable.

Hemp, silk, cotton, tobacco, rice, corn, andvarious fruits,
drugs and gums, are here produced. Rock salt is abundant,
and sheep andcattle are numerous. In the north-eastern part
of the country are some famous mines of turquoise——a gem
peculiar to Persia.

Turks, Tartars, Armenians, Arabs, &c.,_ compose the bulk
of the population. Jews are numerous in all the towns.

Persia is one of the oldest kingdoms of the world.

AFGHANISTAN.
Area in square miles, about 225,000. Population, 5,120,000.
This country formerly constituted part of the Persian
Empire, but is now independent.

It is subdivided into the three principalities of Cabul, Can— A

dahar, and Herat.

The chief ‘cities are Cabul, Candahar, Herat, Jellalabad,
and Ghuzni. Cabul is supposed to excel all other cities in
the excellence of- its fruits.

In .the low and watered plains of the north-east, rice, sugar-
cane, cotton, tobacco, and indigo are raised. Rhubarb and
the assafoetida plant abound in some districts; the latter is
eaten by the inhabitants, stewed in rancid butter. The camel
is the chief beast of burden. _

INDIA BEYOND THE GANGES.
Area in square miles, 1,000,000. Population, 22,000,000.

Indo-China is divided into three states, viz. :——the Kingdom
of Siam, and the Empires of Anam and Burmah. Besides
these, there are some small Malay states occupying the Malay
Peninsula, and a long narrow strip of territory, belonging to
Great Britain, called tl1e Tenasserim Provinces.

The Indo-Chinese peninsula is diversiﬁed. by long river-
valleys, and a succession of mountain chains.

The soil is fertile, and the climate hot and moist, but
generally healthy. Forests are numerous, and yield much
valuable timber, among which are many Woods used as dyes,
and perfumes. Rice is the chief crop, and cotton, indigo,
tobacco, and the suga.r-cane, are extensively grown.

Marble, amber, also sapphires and. other gems, are found in
various parts of the peninsula. Wild animals, such as elephants,
rhinoceroses, tigers, &c., are numerous. ‘

TROPICAL ANIMALS OF ASIA.

- The inhabitants, except those of the Malay Peninsula, bear
a resemblance to the Hindoos and Chinese. Agriculture is
pursued, though in a very imperfect manner. I

The houses are generally constructed of bamboo and matting,

on a foundation of piles. In all the countries of the Indo-
Chinese Peninsula (as, indeed, throughout Asia), a great por-
tion of the laborious occupations is performed by females.

The people of Burmah excel in gilding, and are also noted
for the casting of bells, designed for the service of their nume-
rous temples.

The exports are—-timber, embracing a variety of ornamental
Wood, raw silk, cotton, ivory,-‘gums, cardamom seeds, and edible

‘birds’-nests. These are the nests of a species of svvalloW,'a

native of some of the islands of the Asiatic Archipelago. They
are composed of a sort of glutinous substance, and are eaten as
a luxury by the Chinese.

HU133, the capital of the Empire of Anam, is noted for its
fortress, which is considered the strongest in Asia.

BANGKOK, the capital of Siam, is a large city, and the chief
trading port of the kingdom. _

Malacca, together with an adjacent territory extending about
40 miles along the coast and 30 miles inland, belongs to Great
Britain.

Mo‘ULMA1N is the most important town of the Tenasserim
Provinces.

The capital of Burmah has been transferred from Ava to
Mandalay. Rangoon, the chief port of Burmah, belongs to
the British. The king is despotic, and the people in a partial
state of servitude.

HINDOSTAN.
Area in square miles, 1,500,000. Population, 162,000,000.

The chief divisions of Hindostan are, the British Territo-
ries, the Protected States, and the Independent States.

The British Territories comprise three presidencies———Bengal,
Madras, and Bombay,

The Protected States still retain their own forms of govern-
ment, though they are under either the protection or control
of the British.

T The Independent States comprise Nepaul, Bhotan, and
Cashmere, and are governed by native sovereigns.

HINDOSTAN. 1 1 9

The surface of Hindostan consists of a vast plain in the
north, and of high plateaux, bordered by mountain chains, in
the centre and south. The west, or Malabar coast, is high
and bold, and the east, or Coromandel coast, is low and sandy.

There are some barren tracts in the interior table-lands,
that are deﬁcient in water; but the valleys of the Ganges and
the Indus are very fertile. In the south and middle regions,
the heat is very great, and the year is divided into two seasons
—the wet and the dry. Hurricanes are common.

The woods and jungles, in every part’ of India, abound in
ferocious animals, and birds and insects are very numerous.
The trees are sometimes so completely covered With a beau-
tiful insect called the ﬁre-ﬂy, as to appear like “pyramids of
light.” ‘ .

One of the most remarkable productions of India is the
banyan, or Indian ﬁg-tree, whose branches extend to the earth,
take root, and form new trunks. The largest and most cele-
brated of this kind of tree, grows on the banks of the Ner-
budda. It has more than 3,000 trunks, or stems, and covers
an area of about seven acres.

The vegetable and mineral productions of India are both
rich and varied. Cocoa-nuts, pomegranates, citrons, dates,
tamarinds, pine-apples, bananas, and many other tropical fruits
grow here in great profusion. Indigo and opium are exten-

I sively cultivated. Diamonds and other precious stones are

also among the native products.

About six—sevenths of the inhabitants are included under the
general name of Hindoos; the remainder consist of various
foreigners settled in India. Agriculture forms the leading
pursuit, but is conducted in the most unskilful manner.

Cotton and silk fabrics, and Cashmere shawls, are the most
important manufactures. The leading exports are indigo,
opium, cotton, wool, silk, drugs, perfumes, and precious stones.
The commerce of India is considerable.

CALCUTTA, the capital of the Bengal Presidency and of British
India, is the seat of an immense trade. The English live in

"120 A GEOGRAPHY ron BEGINNERS.

a particular quarter of the city called“ Chowringhee,” and the
natives in another, called the “ Black-town.” The market of
Calcutta is probably the largest one in the world.

BENARES, the holy city of the Hindoos, and the capital of a
province of the Bengal Presidency, is a noted place of resort,
on the occasion of certain festivals, for pilgrims from all parts
of India. It is also celebrated for its trade in diamonds.
Madras, the capital of the Madras Presidency, is the chief
commercial port on the east, or Coromandel coast.

Pondicherry is the capital of the French possessions in
India.

Goa is the capital of the Portuguese possessions in India.

BOMBAY isthe capital of the presidency of the same name.
Its trade is second only to that of Calcutta.

Hydrabad is noted for the manufacture of matchlocks,
swords, spears, and shields, and also for embroidered silk and
cotton goods. I I

The Hindoos are of a dark complexion, and are divided
into castes, or classes,,Which do not marry, or even eat, with
one another. -It Was once common for mothers to drown their
children in the river Ganges, and for widows to be burned on
the funeral pile with their dead husbands, it being imagined
that these things pleased their gods. Christian missionaries
have converted some of these people from their idolatries.

Hindostan was divided among a number of chiefs, called
rajahs, or nabobs. The British have conquered most of these,
and new rule over the greater part of I-Iindostan; including
Ceylon, a fine island at the southern point of this country.

THE CHINESE EMPIRE.
‘Area in square miles, 5,200,000. Population, 380,000,000.

The ‘Chinese empire occupies a vast territory in the middle
and eastern portions of Asia. It embraces not only China, but
Chinese Tartary, Corea, and Thibet.

The Chinese empire is by far the most populous in the
World. Many learned men suppose itto contain 380,000,000
of people.

THE CHINESE EMPIRE. 121

China is very celebrated as being the country that- produces
tea. Sixty millions of pounds of this are carried every year to

England and America.
CHINA PROPER.

Area in square miles, 1,500,000. Population, 367 000,000.

China forms the south-eastern part of the Chinese ‘Empire.

‘Its surface is considerably diversiﬁed. The greater part
presents a succession of river-valleys, divided by ranges of
high lands. In the north-east is an extensive and fertile
plain. -
The soil is fertile, highly cultivated, and well watered; and
the climate cold in the north, but mild in the south. Among
the native productions, the tea-plant is the most noted. Of

grain, rice is the staple product. The sugar-cane,-cotton, '

hemp, tobacco, rhubarb, indigo, varnish-tree, camphor-tree,
tallow-tree, and cinnamon, are among the trees and shrubs
most common in the ﬁelds and gardens. Olives, oranges,
pine-apples, &c. are abundant. The -mulber-ry is extensively

reared for the purposeof the silkworm.

The Chinese are of Mongolian origin. Agriculture and

~manufactures form the leading pursuits. Trade, both inland

and maritime, is extensive. .

Travelling and traﬂic are carried on chieﬂy by means of the
numerous rivers and canals. The Imperial Canal runs through
the eastern part of China, from Pekin to Hang-chou-foo, or
Hangtcheou, a distance of about 700 miles. By means of
another canal the navigation is continuedto Canton, with the
interruption of but a single day’s journey over, a mountain-
chain that intervenes.

In the manufactureof silk and cotton cloths, and earthen-
ware, the Chinese have attained great eminence. They are
noted also for their skill in the carving of ivory, tortoise-
shell, mother-of-pearl, and other ornamental articles, -and
also for the taste they display in the arts of embroidery,

.dyeing, and the making of artificial ﬂowers, and papers of

ﬁne tissue.

122 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

Silk and nankeen stuﬁs, porcelain, lacquered Wares, articles
of ivory, &c. are exported.

PEKIN, the capital of the empire, consists of two contiguous
cities, each encircled by lofty walls, and inhabited, respectively,
by the Tartarsand the Chinese. The Tartar city contains
the Imperial palace.

Nankin is one of the principal seats of the silk, paper, and
cotton manufactures of China.

‘Shanghae, Ningpo, Fu—chu-fu, or Fou—tchou-foo,Amoy, and
Canton, are the chief commercial ports of China. Chang-
chu-fu is situated about thirty-six miles south-westof its port,
Amoy.

THIBET.

The climate of this country is cold, and the attention of the
people is directed mainly to the rearing of sheep and goats.
The ﬁne hair of the latter, which is used in making Cashmere
shawls, is largely exported. Musk-deer are found in great
numbers among the mountains.

Lassa, the capital of Thibet, is distinguished as being the
residence of the Grand Lama, and is usually crowded with
noble personages from various parts of Asia, who come to do
him homage and offer costly presents. ’

SECTION XXXVII.——-Palestine.

This is the most interesting, as it is also the most important

country of the world, in its associations with all that is sacred. ,

in religion and venerable in antiquity. .
The Jew regards it with veneration, as the scene of all the
glorious events of the Old Testament Scriptures ; the scene of

the magniﬁcence of his country in the time of Solomon and

the kings; and the ‘land where the prophets promise to GrO(1’S
people a future national existence, under the favour and
protection of the Great King,..when all “nations shall beat
their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into pruning-
hooks, and learn war no more.” “ Then,”- says the ancient
Jewish poet, “ God shall visit the earth, and bless it; and
the earth shall bring forth her increase ; and the nations shall
praise Him.”

Mankind should honour a people through whom the world

has been blessed withithe sacred oracles, and taught the advan- J

tages of peace. 1  
The Mohammedan regards Palestine as sacred, because the
Koran teaches him that the Jewish Scriptures are true, and

that he should worship the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and

Jacob- Hence when, in the yeareA.D. 637, a successor of
Mohammed, Omar, “the commander of the faithful,” was
advised that -Sophronius, the last of the Christian patriarchs
who governed Jerusalem, was about to capitulate and deliver
the city up to his besieging armies, he proceeded to that place,
from Mecca, the residence of the prophet, mounted on a red
camel, and attended‘ by the grandees of the realm, to receive
in person the keys of the city: “ For,” said he, “it is holy
ground, and it becomes us to honour so great a city.” As the
patriarch met the Oaliph on the site of the ancient Temple,
and handed him the keys of the city, he ,said, in the Greek
language, “ Now the a-bominantimz that malceth desolate stands in
the holy place, as was spoken by Daniel the -prophet.” On
that spot Omar built a magniﬁcent temple, called “The

Mosque of Omar.” For more than twelve centuries, Jews and
Christians have been excluded from the Temple grounds, under
pain of death. Of late years seve_ral_p_ersons have been admitted
to view the interior of this mosque. There is a large and
massiverrailing built around a portion of rockthat projects from
the ground underthe, dome .of the mosque (the _rock is about
the Size of an ordinary cottage). This railing is _compos_e.d._o_f
gold, _silver, and copper, and is of immense value.

The dome is canopied with Damascus silks, of great value
and gorgeous colours._ The pillars, ceilings, and ﬂoors are of
various kinds of -the mostbeautifuland, rare marble, jporphyry,
&c. ,It_is« supposed that the Ark of the Covenant isconcealed
in-an , arch under this church. ’ The Jews and the Freemasons
have traditions to this effect.

' To the Christian this is themost sacred of all lands.

It was here that the Christ, the Great Messiah, whomthe
Christian worships as the only God; who was revealed to
Moses and the prophets; _and who alone has brought, men to
the knowledge of “ the Father ” and “the Holy Ghost,”
“ whom ” (ie. the Father and the Holy Ghost) “ no man hath
seen at anytime, nor can see ; ” it was here that He became

incarnate, “and was made man, and dwelt among us; and

being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and
became obedient.unto death, even death upon the cross ;».that
by Hisdeath He might deliver them who, all their lifetime,
were in bondage through fear of ‘ death; and that God might
be -just, and yetjustify the sinner; for He who knew no sin
became sin for us, that we might be_righteous before God, in
Him.” Here He lived as a child and as [a man, the man
Christ Jesus, the son of Mary. Here He taughtandhelped
the poor and the ignorant. Here He healed the blind, and the
lame, and thedeaf, and the dumb. Here He raised the_dead,

_,_and was Himself cruciﬁed, dead, and buried here ; and hence,

from the summit of Mount Olivet, he ascended up to the
heaven of heavens, there to reign as King. over all nations,
until He shall come a second time to judge the world.

PALESTINE. 1'25
Mohammed taughthis followers that, at the end of the world,
all the dead are to assemble in the valley of J ehoshaphat,
between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and be judged.
The Christian Scriptures say, in the most simple but sub-
lime Words, -“ The hour is coming when all 7;that are in the
graves shall hear the ‘voice of the Son of Man, and shall come
forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life,‘ and
they that have done evil unto the 9"eswrr‘eeti0n of ela-nmation.”
Palestine is now inhabited by Arabs and mixed races, Whose
tenureupon the soil and‘ its produce is so uncertain‘ that they
have little encouragement to improve the land, and it is very
poorly cultivated; but even with the best cultivation it is - not
as productive now as it was‘ in former times, when the rains
were more regular and abundant. The population is therefore’
verysparse, compared with the early period of the Christian era.
Among its remarkable natural. features is the Dead Sea,
whose surface is many hundred feet below-the surface of the
ocean, and into whichthe river.Jordan empties;-. -This-A-sea has
no outlet;

are common in Southern Europe. Drugs, dyes, cotton, indigo;
and saffron, are cultivated. Date plantations furnish the chief
food of the people.

The inhabitants consist of Arabs, Jews, Turks, and Moors.
Agriculture is much neglected. Many of the people lead a
pastoral life.

Mules -and camels are used as beasts of burden. Caravans
come annually from Central Africa, bringing slaves, gold dust,
gum, ivory, senna, and ostrich feathers, which are exchanged
for manufactured goods, spices, gunpowder, &c.

The manufactures are red woollen caps, embroidery, leather,
boots, slippers, soap, and essences. Oil, wood, sponges, red
caps, soap, and essences, together with the surplus produce
received from Central Africa, form the exports.

TUNIS, the capital, is the largest commercial city of Barbary.
It is under the government of a Bey, and is, therefore, styled a
Bcylilc.

Kairwan is noted for its manufactures.

TRIPOLI.
Area in square miles, 140,000. Population, 1,500,000.

Tripoli, one of the Barbary States, includes Barca and the
district of Fezzan.

In the eastern part are extensive tracts of almost barren
sands; in the southern, the surface is mountainous, and in
the western, diversiﬁed.

The soil is fertile. Droughts prevail from May to Sep-
tember, and during this period the heat is intense. The pro-
ductions are similar to those of Tunis.

The towns are inhabited by Moors and Jews, while the
rural population consists of Arabs.

The manufactures are carpets, cloaks, articles made of goat’s

hair, leather, potash, and coarse earthenware. The exports
consist of the products of the date and olive plantations, toge-
ther with -manufactured goods. Rock salt is an article of
export ; and cattle, sheep, and poultry are sent to Malta.

TRIPOLI is the capital of the pashalic of Tripoli, and carries
on trade with the interior of Africa. It is governed by a
pasha, who is nominally subject to the Turkish Empire.

BARCA is inhabited by Bedouin Arabs.

FEZZAN, a state of Northern Africa, is ruled by a Sultan,
who holds his dominions as tributary to the Pasha of Tripoli,
to whom he pays an annual tribute.

The Fezzaneers, who appear to be a mixed race interme-
diate between the Arab and the Negro,’ amount to about 75,000.
Some are as black as Negroes and_ others are as white as the
Moors on the Barbary coast. Figs, pomegranates, lemons,
and garden vegetables, are plentiful. Dates form not only
the chief produce of the country, but the principal food of its
inhabitants. _ _ _

MOURZOUK, the capital, is noted as being the place of
rendezvous for caravans to and from the Barbary States,
Egypt, and Central Africa.

EGYPT.
Area in square miles, 224,000. Population, 2,896,000.

The great feature of Egypt is the River Nile, without which

.the whole country would be a desert. Thevalley of this river

is narrow, being shut in by high rocks, beyond which on either
side it is mostly desert.
The soil of the valley of the Nile is rendered exceedingly

‘ fertile by the annual inundations of the river. The climate of

Egypt is hot and dry. It never snows, and rain is of rare
occurrence. Grain, cotton, rice, indigo, and various kinds of
drugs and fruits, are the chief productions. _

134 A GEOGRAPHY ron BEGINNERS.

.Dhom~m (a kind of grain) is extensively cultivated. It is
sometimes eaten like Indian corn, being previously roasted in
the ﬁre; its stalk is eaten green like the sugar-cane; its dried
pith is used as starch, and the leaves serve as food for cattle.
This grain and beans are objects of culture. The latter are
sold boiled in all public places, and also serve as food for the
camels. ' '

Plantations‘ of mulberry-trees have been recently made for
the purpose" of rearing the silkworm. In parts of Western
Egypt roses are plentiful, and from these rose-water is distilled.

Sheep and goats are extensively reared. Bees are kept in
great numbers" in boats; they spread themselves over the
banks of the Nile during the day in quest of food, and return
regularly to the boats every evening. The Nile abounds in
ﬁsh. ' _ ' ‘

The majority of the inhabitants (called Fellahs) are of Arabic
descent, and are engaged as peasants and labourers: the
remainder embrace Copts, Turks, Greeks, Jews, &c. The
Turks hold the principal oiﬁces under government. Agricul-,
ture forms the leading pursuit. The manufacture of jars and
porous earthenware is a branch of industry.

In ascending the Nile the traveller beholds here and

there specimens of ancient art, embracing pyramids, temples,

colossal statues, obelisks, and sphinxes, together with a
variety of sculptures and paintings on the walls of temples,
and caves cut out of the rocks, upon either side of the river’s
course. .

South-west of Cairo, on the opposite bank of the Nile, is the
small town of Grhizeh, about ﬁve miles to the south-west of
which are the-three principalEgyptian pyramids. The largest,
called the “ Pyramid of Cheops,” is 480 feet in height, and its
base covers eleven acres of ground.

Great attention» has been given by .Mehemet Ali, and his
successors, to internal improvements. Roads and railways
have been constructed, and a vast ship canal is in course of
completion, uniting‘ .the Mediterranean and Red Seas.

The Overland route, as it is called, between Europe and
India, is by steamers which proceed up the Mediterranean Sea
to Alexandria, thence to Cairo, and thence by railway across
the desert to Suez, where the route by steamers is resumed
to the Various ports of India, touching on the Way at Aden (a
station in the southern part of Arabia) for a fresh supply of
coal. ‘ ’

The manufactures are linen goods, carpets, silk handker-
chiefs, jewellery,‘ and pottery. The exports are cotton, rice,
wheat, rose-water, indigo, senna, dates, opium, coffee, gums,
porous earthen jars, matting, and carpets. Of these cotton is
the most important. A

ABYSSINIA.

Area in square miles, 280,000. Population, 3,000,000.
Abyssinia is divided into several states.
Its surface is mountainous and well Watered.

ABYSSINIA. 137

The soil is remarkable for its fertility, and furnishes, with-
out cultivation, many of the ﬁnest vegetable productions of
the torrid zone. The climate is intensely hot in the valleys,
but in the elevated districts it is mild. Teﬁ (a herbaceous
plant), from which bread is made, is the favourite article of
food.

Cotton, ﬂax, and coffee are cultivated. Most of the wild
animals indigenous to Africa are found in the mountains of
Abyssinia. Great numbers of hippopotamuses are killed
annually on the shores of Lake Dembea. Crocodiles infest
the rivers. Bees are numerous, and their honey forms an
important article of food.

The inhabitants embrace many distinct tribes, and are in a
barbarous condition.

The Abyssinians embraced Christianity in the time of
Constantine: at the present day, however,—there are but few
traces of their former faith left. They are now debased by
savage practices. V

The ferocious Grallas have overrun portions of the country
and possessed themselves of some of its ﬁnest provinces.

The exports are gold dust, ivory, and slaves.

EASTERN AFRICA.

Zanguebar is partly subject to the Sultan or Imaum of

Muscat, and partly governed by native princes. The trade is ’

in the hands of the Arabs. The exports consist of rice, sugar,
gums, elephants’ teeth, and ostrich feathers.

Zanzibar is the capital and metropolis of the Sultan’s
possessions in Eastern Africa. Magadoxa, capital of a state
of the same name, is the chief commercial port between Cape
Gruardafui and Juba.

Melinda, capital of a state of its own name, carries on a
caravan trade with the interior, and is also engaged in com-
merce with some of the countries of Southern Asia.

Quiloa is the residence of a governor ‘under the Imaum of
Muscat.

138 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

The chief settlements on this line of coast are Mozambique,
Quilimane, and Sofala. _
These towns are in possession of the Portuguese. The
exports are slaves, ivory, gold, and coffee. Ivory is the staple
article of trade. ' , T
The town of Mozambique is the residence of the Portuguese
governor, and the capital of the Portuguese possessions in
Eastern Africa. V
Quilimane is the capital of a government of the Portuguese
possessions in Mozambique. Sofala, also, is the ‘capital of a
government, and carries on considerable export trade.

SOUTHERN AFRICA.

The divisions of Southern Africa are——-the Zoolu Country,

«Natal Colony, Caﬁ"raria, Cape Colony, Hottentots’ Country,

and the Country of the Bechuanas.
yr The Zoolahs belong to_ tl1e,Caﬁ‘re race.

Natal is a colony of Great Britain. The surface is undu-
lating and well watered, the soil fertile, and the climate, though
hot, is said to be healthy. Cotton, indigo, and the sugar-
cane grow wild, and fruits are plentiful. ,

The Caﬁres are of a dark brown complexion, and have
frizzled hair, which is“ said to be less woolly than that of the
Negro. War, hunting, and tending cattle are the employments
of the men, while the Women build the huts and till the land;
A part of Caffraria is now under the control of the British,
and King William.’s Town is the capital.

Cape Colony is a dependency of Great Britain. The soil
along the coast is fertile; the climate changeable, owing to the
extreme irregularity of the rains. Wild animals, such as lions,
hyenas, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, &c., are numerous, par-
ticularly in the northern districts. Oxen are used for purposes
of draught, and convey the produce from the interior to Cape
Town and other ports for shipment.

. The inhabitants consist of British settlers, Dutch farmers
or Boors,_ Hottentots, and Caﬂ°res. Cattle-rearing forms the

SOUTHERN AFRICA. 139

important branch of rural industry. The commerce of the
colony is considerable : the chief exports are corn, Wine, wool,
hides, horns, ivory, and butter. ~

CAPE TOWN is the capital of the colony. It is the chief
seaport; and vessels frequently stop at the town for the pur-
pose of obtaining Water and other refreshments.

The Hottentots’ Country is inhabited by various tribes,
known by the name of Hottentots.

Some of them live upon gums, roots, and a kind of bread
which they make from the pith of the palm-tree. The better

sort live upon the milk and ﬂesh of their cattle, and the pro-

duce of the chase.

The Country of the Bechuanas.—-—The inhabitants are divided
into various tribes, and, each has its hereditary chief or king,
who commonly resides in the largest town that belongs to his
particular tribe. A

They are said to excel .the other tribes of Southern Africa in
arts and civilization. They cultivate the soil, live in com-
fortable, well-constructed houses, and have several large towns
in their territory.

WESTERN AFRICA.

Gruineais divided into Upper and Lower Guinea, and sub-
divided into several states: the chief of these are-—Benin,
Abomey, Coomassie, Biafra, Loango, Congo, Angola, and

’ Benguela.

Among the productions of Guinea the palm-tree is the most
useful. Its nuts, when young, are eaten roasted, and from
them, when old, an oil is extracted, which the natives use with
their food. From the trunk of the tree is drawn a species of
wine, and of the leaves are made ropes, nets, &c.

The negro traders bring ebony, palm oil, gold dust, slaves,
ivory, &c., from the interior to the settlements on the coast,
and exchange them for beads, gunpowder, ﬁre-arms, tobacco,
&c., brought in vessels from various countries of the civilized
World.

140 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

The British" have some settlements on the coast of Upper
Guinea, of which Cape Coast Castle is the capital. The
exports from this sea-port town consist of palm-oil, gold dust,
maize, and tortoise-shell.

LIBERIA, a Negro republic, was established by the American
Colonization Society in 1821, as a place of refuge for free
blacks. Agriculture is extensively pursued, and commerce is
increasing.

Sierra Leone, a colonial possession of Great Britain, contains
an area of 232 square miles.

SENEGAMBIA, an extensive region of Weste1'n Africa, is
divided into several states. The climate is intensely hot, and
the productions are varied and abundant. The inhabitants are
chieﬂy negroes.

The J aloof States are in the neighbourhood of the Senegal
River and Cape Verde: the Foulah States lie higher up the
same river; and the Mandingo States are situated on the
Senegal, to the north and east of the Jaloof States. The
French, English, and Portuguese have some small settlements
on the rivers.

Timbo is the capital of Foota J allou, a state of Senegambia,
Benowm is the capital of Ludamar, a north—eastern state of

- Senegambia.

The SAHARA, or the Great Desert, occupies the central part
of Northern Africa.

Both the soil and the climate are unfavourable to vegetation,
and consequently afford very sparingly the ‘means of sustaining
animal life, but there are a few fertile spots called oases. In
the south there are some salt-mines.

Between the countries south and those north of the Desert,
is established a commerce which is carried on by caravans con-
sisting of from two hundred to ﬁve hundred persons and several
hundred camels.

The merchants bring from Soudan gold, ivory, slaves, ostrich
feathers, &c., and take, in return, European manufactures.
The westerly caravan route is from Timbuctoo on the south, to

WESTERN AFRICA. T 141

Tatta, and thence to Fez, in Morocco, on the north. Another
route is from Lake Tsad to Mourzouk; and one still farther
east, extends from Wara in Darfur, to Siout, in Egypt.

To the West of the route between Timbuctoo and Fez, live
the “Moors, and to the east of it are the Tooareeks. The
Moors of the Desert are represented as being very different
from the Moors Who inhabit the towns in the Barbary States.
As no portion of their territory is fit for cultivation, they
depend on the produce of their herds. They do not live
in ﬁxedhabitations, but in tents, which they remove fromone
place to another, to ﬁnd suﬁicient herbage for their ﬂocks.

The Tibboos occupy a territory lying along‘ the route from
Lake Tsad to Mourzouk. Their country is the best part of
the desert, as it contains several cases. They carry on trade
with the caravans which pass through their territory.

CENTRAL AFRICA.

Central Africa comprises the interior regions of Africa, from
the Great Desert on the north to the country of the Bechuanas
on the south. T

states are Houssa, Bournou‘, Kanem, Bergoo, Darfur, Begharmi,
Adamana, Yarriba, and Bambarra.

Houssa is inhabited by Fellahs. They are an industrious

as Well as a warlike race; and the country yields wheat,

fruits, vegetables, cotton, and indigo. Kano is the capital;

town.

Bournou occupies an extensive plain. The inhabitants are
negroes, and their principal Wealth consists in slaves and
cattle. Kouka, on‘ the west bank of Lake Tsad, is the
capital town. . . .

Kanem is a large state situated north. of Lake Tsad. The
inhabitants possess numerous herds of horses and cattle.

Bergoo,.or VVaday, is a large but imperfectly known state.
The inhabitants carry on some trade With Egypt by means of
caravans. Wara is the capital ‘town.

Darfur.4—The inhabitants are a mixture of Arabs and
Negroes. The chief products arerice, millet, maize, tobacco,-
tamarinds, dates, &c. Gobbe is the capital town. —-

Bambarra is a ﬁne plain Watered by the Niger; and Sego,
its capital, is a large and ﬂourishing town. It has numerous
mosques, and carries on considerable trade. It was at this
place that Mungo Park first saw the J oliba, or Niger ; and at
Boussa, on the same river, he was killed in 1805.

Timbuctoo, an important trading city of Soudan, on the
border of the Great Desert, is engaged in the. caravan trade.

Kordofan is inhabited by Negroes, Arabs, and emigrants
from Dongola. This country was subdued by the Pasha of
Egypt, and it therefore forms a part of the Egyptian domi-
nions. Obeid is the capital.

The Grallas are divided into numerous tribes, and are dis-
persed in great numbers over the adjoining countries. They
are described as being ferocious and cruel. ’ i

MADAG-ASCAR.

The Island of Madagascar is divided by a ridge of mountains
which extends from north to south. _ T

The soil is fertile, with rich pasturage and magniﬁcent
forests; but the climate is hot and unhealthy, particularly on
the coasts. The forests contain a variety of beautiful and
useful trees, among which is a wild ﬁg-tree, yielding a milky

juice, which thickens into an elastic gum. Of this the natives i

make ﬁambeaux for various purposes, but particularly for
ﬁshing during the night. The raven, a species of palm-tree,
is peculiar to this island. The Wood serves for planks; the
ribs of the leaves are used for partition walls; with the
leaves the people thatch their dwellings, or make plates and

other dishes; the top part of the tree, which is a kind of

cabbage, serves as an article of food, and its ﬂowers afford
a gummy substance, somewhat resembling honey.

Madagascar is larger than the island of Great Britain. The

inhabitants are mixed races—white, tawny, and black—and
are in a11 almost savage state. Their number is supposed to
be three or four millions. The island is very fertile, and
produces sugar, honey, fruit-trees, cattle, precious stones, iron,
silver, copper, and tin.

Silk-worms are reared, and honey and wax are found in
abundance in the woods. Minerals are abundant.

The island is divided into several provinces, each having a
chief, who is subject to one common sovereign. Tananarivo
is the capital. A

 

BOURBON, a French colonial possession, is situated in the
Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar. No venomous serpents
are found on ‘the island. The exports are sugar, coffee, dye-

rendered celebrated by its being the prison of Napoleon,
Emperor of France, after his abdication, and also the place of
his death. He was banished to that island in 1815, and, after
six years’ imprisonment, expired there in 1821. The body of
Napoleon, after lying in a humble grave near his prison-house
for nineteen years, was carried to France in 1840, and buried
by his countrymen with great pomp and solemnity. This

Three great mountain systems diversify the surface, viz. :—-

The Andes, Which stretch along the Western coast, from
southern Patagonia to the Isthmus of Panama; the Parima
Mountains, which extend along the southern border of Vene-
zuela, a distance of about 600 miles, separating the plains of
the Orinoco from those of the Rio Negro; and the Brazilian
Mountains, consisting of two great ranges running parallel to
the coast of Brazil, with several diverging chains.
_ Between the Andes on the one side, and the mountain sys-
tems of Southern Venezuela and Brazil upon the other, extends
a vast plain. This great plain may be divided into three parts,
'-———the region of the Llanos, or Savannahs (prairies), Which
occupy a great part of the basin of the Orinoco ; the region of
the Selvas, or forest plains, which spread over the lower portion
of the basin of the Amazon, as far as the annual inundations of
that river extend ; and the region of the Pampas of La Plata.

The greater part of the inhabitants are descendants of the
native Indians; some of these are semi—civilized, and others
are still in a‘ savage state. The ruling people are the descend-
ants of Europeans, mostly Spaniards and Portuguese. Nearly
the Whole of South America, for about three centuries ante-
cedent to the present, was under the control of European

THE REPUBLIC OF NEW GRANADA.
Area in square miles, 522,000. Population, 2,243,000.

Several chains of the Andes based upon elevated table-lands
overspread a large portion of the country. East of the moun«
tains are extensive llanos, or plains.

The soil is fertile, and the climate is hot and unhealthy,
except on the elevated table-land. ' In the uplands wheat and
other grains are produced, and in the river basins, and along
the coasts, coffee, cotton, cocoa, indigo, sugar, tobacco,
together with various medicinal herbs, and tropical fruits.

The llamas afford pasturage for immense herds of cattle and
horses, and the forests are rich in dye and cabinet woods.
Minerals are abundant, particularly gold, silver, platina, and
rock salt. About 50 miles north of Bogota, are the emerald
mines, which supply a great part of the World with this
precious stone. A »

North-east of and near the city of Bogota, is the Cataract
of Tequendama, in the’River Bogota——a branch of the Magda-
lena. The height of this cataract is about 570 feet, and the
Width of the stream 36 feet. The natural bridges of Icononzo
are much celebrated. The largest consists of a natural arch of
stone 50 feet long, and 40 Wide, stretching over a chasm
(through which rolls a swift torrent) at an elevation of 318 feet,
above the surface of the Water.

NEW GRANADA. 151

The population is composed of Whites, Indians, Negroes,
and mixed races. Agriculture is in arude state. The farmers
are chieﬂy occupied in raising live stock. ~

In the mountainous districts there are no roads, and indi-
viduals are carried on a kind of basket—chair on the backs of
porters. In other parts, mules form the chief means of con-

veyance. The method of crossing streams is by ropes

stretched from one side to the other with sling and basket,
in which the traveller seats himself, and is pulled safely over. I
Steamboats now ply on the Magdalena, which will much-
facilitate the development of the country ; and a railroad,
recently built, spans the Isthmus of Panama.
The articles of export are hides, specie, and bullion.
BOGOTA, the capital city, is situated in a fertile plain on the
left bank of the Bogota, nearly 9,000 feet. above thelevel of
the sea. All the houses are low, in consequence of the appre-
hension of earthquakes ; and are built of sun-dried brick,
whitewashed and covered with tiles. Churches and convents
cover nearly half the city. A

This portion‘ of Northern South America consists of
three colonies belonging to France, Holland, and Great
Britain, called respectively French, Dutch, and British
Guiana.

Along the coast thevland is low and ﬂat, so that the country
appears, upon approaching it, like a line of trees growing out
of the water. It is level for some distance inland, and in the
south it is hilly and mountainous.

The soil is rich, in consequence of being covered with Water
during the rainy season. The climate is hot. On the coast
there are two winters, or rainy seasons, and two dry seasons,
during the year. Vegetation is luxuriant. Dye, and other
valuable woods, spices, and fruits and plants peculiar to tropi-
cal countries, are plentiful. Insects are numerous. Ant-
hilloclzs have been seen as high as 15 or 20 feet, and nearly
100 feet in circumference.

THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA.
Area in square miles, 450,000. Population, 1,700,000.

The western part is traversed by ridges of the Andes, and
in the east are extensiveplains. The coast district is a sterile
desert. The great plateau, where lake Titicaca is situated, is
12,000 feet above the level of the Paciﬁc.

The soil is fertile, and the climate varies much in different
parts of the country, according to the elevation and the distance
from the equator. _

In the more elevated parts Indian corn, wheat, and other
grains are cultivated ; and in the lower districts tropical fruits

Sand plants are raised to some extent. Cinchona trees, from

which Peruvian bark is obtained, are numerous.

Nearly three-fourths of the people are either Indians or
mixed races. Some of the native Indian tribes are intelligent
and industrious, and others are still in a savage state. Agri-
culture and mining form the chief pursuits.

Goods are transported on the backs of mules and other

‘beasts of burden.

Cotton goods, and cloths of llama and alpaca hair, glass
wares, leather, silver, and hats of vicuna wool, are made to a

‘limited extent. The exports are precious metals, wool, hats,

Andes and the ocean, and the great plains, which extend

PERU. 1 5 9

eastward from the Andes to the interior of Brazil. Volcanoes
are numerous. .

The soil is fertile in some parts, and the climate varies
according to the elevation. In the mountain region it is cold,
and here and in the eastern plains, the rains are abundant
during six months of the year, While on the coast it is uniformly
hot, and no rain ever falls, though dense mists are of frequent
occurrence.

Grrains and rice ﬂourish in the temperate districts, and the
Warmer valleys supply abundant crops of tropical plants and
fruits. The mountain region abounds in minerals. The coca
plant, which supplies the place of the tobacco leaf, is cultivated
both in Peru and Bolivia.

Guano, which is extensively used both in Europe and our
own country as a manure, has been largely exported from the
little group of the Chincha Islands, lying off the coast of Peru,
about 150 miles from Lima.

The Whites do not equal one-seventh of the entire popula-
tion. The Indians of Peru are the descendants of races who
had attained considerable civilization prior to the discovery of
the New World. Agriculture is the chief employment, and
mining receives some attention.

Coarse cotton and Woollen cloths, leather cloaks, and jewel-
lery are manufactured to some extent.

The exports.consist of bullion, chinchilla skins, Peruvian
bark, cotton, copper-ore, vicuna, alpaca and sheep’s Wool,
hides and sugar. The exports of guano in 1852 amounted
to 220,500 tons, 32,000 of Which were sent to our own

table-lands of the Sierra Madre the climate is cold; in all the

regions situated on the slopes of the mountains it is temperate; T

and on the coasts it is hot.

The productions‘ vary at different elevations; so that in
Mexico may be found the fruits, vegetables and plants peculiar
to almost every clime. Indian corn and the banana are the
staple products. The maguey, a variety of the agave, or
American aloe, furnishes a beverage called pulgue, of which
the inhabitants consume a great quantity.

10 in breadth. The city is the emporium of trade between
Canada and the United States.

The Roman Catholic cathedral in this city is the ﬁnest
ediﬁce in British America. It is faced with stone, has six
towers, and is capable of containing 10,000 persons.

A railroad extends from Longueil, a small place on the
St. ‘Lawrence, opposite Montreal, to Portland in Maine, a
distance of about 300 miles. '

There are numerous other railways leading from the city,
andconnecting it with all the great cities of British America
and the United States.

176 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

THREE R1vE:as.——The St. Maurice River divides into three
channels at its mouth————hence the name of this town. It ranks
next to Quebec and Montreal in importance. The inhabitants
are mostly of French descent ;i and it is one of the '-oldest
towns in Canada.

NEW BRUNSWICK.
Area in square mi1es,'27,700. Population, 194,000.

The surface is considerably varied. Along the shores of
the Gulf the country is level, and the tract along the Bay. of
Fundy is rocky and uneven. The land is covered with dense
forests.

The soil is fertile ; the climate and productions are similar
to those of Canada. Potatoes are the chief article of culture,
and the ﬁsheries are highly important. Manganese and iron
are abundant, and coal is plentiful.

Shipbuilding is carried on at St.’ John ; .but the chief
employments are the timber trade and the ﬁsheries. The
exports are timber, dried ﬁsh, gypsum, and grindstones.

FREDERICKTON is the capital of the province. The streets are
spacious, and, as land is cheap, much space is devoted to
garden plats throughout the city. The merchants obtain their
goods mostly from St. John. Between these two places
steamers ply frequently, except during Winter, when the com-
munication is maintained by means of sledges drawn by horses
over the ice. .

St. John stands on a steep slope separated by a projecting
rock into two portions. Its harbour is ﬁne and ably defended
by several forts. It is the entrepot of a Wide extent of country,
and has extensive docks for shipbuilding.

NOVA SCOTIA.
Area in square miles, 18,700. Population, 276,000.
The surface is greatly diversiﬁed, and Well watered. The

interior forms a table—land of moderate elevation. No portion
of the peninsula exceeds an elevation of 700 feet above the

NOVA SCOTIA. 177

level of the sea. The coasts contain inlets, some of which

form excellent harbours. \

There are highly fertile districts, but these are of limited
extent; and only a very small part of the peninsula is under
cultivation. The winters are very severe, and the summers short
and hot. Fogs are frequent along the line of the Atlantic coast.

Grain and potatoes form the staple crops. Goal of excellent
quality abounds, and grindstones are very extensively quarried.
The resources of the colony are the timber, plaster and coal
trade, and the ﬁsheries. .

The pursuits of the inhabitants are agriculture, the lumber
business, and the coasting trade. The exports are lumber,
ﬁsh, coal, gypsum, grindstones, whale and seal oil and furs.

HALIFAX, the capital of Nova Scotia, is the chief naval station
for the British North American colonies.

The appearance of the city from the wateris peculiar and
prepossessing. The wharves are lined with vessels; and the
dwelling-houses and public buildings rear their heads over
each other as they stretch along and up the sides of the hill
on which the city is built.

Mailsteamers from England and the United States stop at
this place. A steam communication is kept up between Halifax
and St. John in New Brunswick,.and other neighbouring towns.

LABRADOR is included in the government of Newfoundland.
Several hundred schooners come annually to the east coast of

Labrador from the neighbouring provinces, bringing with them

not less than 20,000 men for the purpose of ﬁshing off the
coast. Besides these, the crews of about400 United States
vessels visit this coast during the same time. The ‘ﬁshy here
caught arewhales, cod, salmon, and herring. The resident
inhabitants are occupied as furriers and seal—catchers.

NEWFOUNDLAND.-
Area in square miles, 36,000. Population, 100,000.
The surface of this island is marshy, and the shores are
deeply indented by numerous bays. .
' 12

178 A GEOGRAPHY For. BEGINNERS.

The soil is ill suited to agriculture. The climate in the
winter is severe; and during a great part of the year the
atmosphere is humid, and fogs are very prevalent. Pasturage
is plentiful, and the plains abound with deer. Timber is
scarce; and the resources of the inhabitants are in the
ﬁsheries, of which the cod ﬁshery is the most important.

The banks of Newfoundland are extensive submarine eleva-
tions, which lie in the Atlantic to the south of theisland, and
spread over between 600 and 7.00 miles in length. The
depths of water on these vary from 15 to 80 fathoms. At
these banks are the ﬁshing-grounds that have for many years
attracted, not only English, but French and American ﬁsher-
men to these quarters.

The inhabitants are chieﬂy Irish.

Shipbuilding is carried on to ‘a small extent; but the
materials are imported from New Brunswick. The exports
are the produce of the ﬁsheries. »

St. JoHN’s, the capital of the island, is much resorted to
during the ﬁshing season; and is the only town worthy of note
on the island. S 0

THE ISLAND OF CAPE BRETON.
Area in square miles, 3:100. Population, 55,000.
The surface is broken and hilly, and the island is Very
irregularly shaped, being indented by numerous bays, and
almost intersected by an arm of the sea, called Bras d’Or.

_ The soil is fertile, and the climate is not so rigorous as in
the continental colonies. Fish and coal are the articles of

export.

The inhabitants are emigrants from the Scottish Hebrides,
and their descendants. Fishing is the leading object of pur-
suit. '

Sydney is the capital. In the vicinity are extensive beds of
bituminous coal. A steamer plies between this place and
Halifax during the summer.

179

PRINCE EDwARD’s ISLAND.
Area in square miles, 2,100. Population, 63,000.

The surface is level, or undulating, and well watered; ‘the
soil fertile ; and the climate is milder than that of the neigh-_
bouring colonies. The pastures are rich, timber is abundant,
and the ﬁsheries are extensive.

The inhabitants are Acadian French settlers and Highland
Scotch. The chief pursuit is agriculture, and the commerce
of the island consists in the exchange of its agricultural pro-
ducts, timber, dry and pickled ﬁsh, for manufactures and other
articles of consumption.

Charlottetown is the capital. Many of the inhabitants are
extensively engaged in shipbuilding.

Anticosti is a desert island, containing an area of about
2,600 square miles, situated at the mouth of the St. Lawrence,
dividing the river into two channels, from -twenty to forty miles
in width. On the south—western point of the island stands a
lofty and magniﬁcent lighthouse, which is visible for a distance
of twenty—ﬁve miles. The island belongs to Canada East.

The rMagdal_en Isles consist of a chain of islands, situated in
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, about seventy miles west of New-
foundland. They are inhabited by about 2,000 persons, chieﬂy
French Acadians, whose dependence is upon the cod and
mackerel ﬁshing on the banks, in the vicinity of the group.

The surface is level‘, except in the northern part, where it is
hilly. A ridge, less than 100 feet high, traverses the state
from north to south, and separates the streams which empty
into the Atlantic from those which flow into the bays. This
ridge, or table-land, abounds inswamps. The soil is fertile;
the climate is mild; and the staples are grain, and the pro-
duce of the dairies and market gardens. The exports are
gunpowder, flour, and peaches. A

MARYLAND.
Area, 11,000 square miles. Counties, 21. Population, 600,000.
The surface, both on the “ eastern and western shores,” is
level. But, from the city of Baltimore westward, it is hilly
and mountainous. The soil is fertile. The climate is mild.

THE SOUTHERN STATES. I 181

The staples-—tobacco, grain, coal, and iron, Which are articles
of export. i A. '

Annapolis contains a ﬁne State House, and a Naval Aca-
demy. St. J ol1n’s College is also located he.re. In the State
House, the old Continental Congress held some of its sessions,
and the Senate Chamber, Where General VVashington resigned
his commission, at the close of theiﬂevolutionary War, has
been preserved unaltered.

Cumberland is noted for its trade‘ in coal. In respect to
population, it is not surpassed by any other city in the state
except Baltimore.

Frederick City ranks second in the state in Wealth and
commercial importance, and third in population. The Valley

of Monocacy River is remarkable, not only for its beauty, but

for its agricultural resources and its mineral Wealth.

‘Frederick is the depot of this district, and carries on a large
trade. 0

BALTIMORE, the metropolis of the state, is pleasantly situated
on slightly undulating ground around a bay, and is ornamented
with numerous monuments and fountains. It is called “The
Monumental City.” It is a great market for tobacco and
flour.

VIRGINIA.

Area in square miles, 61,350. Population, 1,422,000. Inhabitants to "a. square mile, 23.
Counties, 140.

Tlie surface is divided into. four sections ':--First, the
tide-Water district, bordering on Chesapeake Bay and the
Atlantic Ocean; second, the Piedmont district, which extends
from the head of tide-Water on the rivers, Westward to the
Blue Ridge ; third, the Valley between the Blue Ridge and the
Alleghany ; and fourth, the Trans-Alleghany district, com-
prising all that part of the state Westward of the Alleghany
Mountains.

In the tide-Water district, the soil is good, especially along
the banks of the rivers ; the Piedmont section is Well adapted
to the growth of Indian corn, tobacco, and cotton; the Valley

1.82 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

district is fertile; and between the mountains and the -Ohio
the soil is productive only in the valleys. _ h

The extent of the state and its varied topography produce
a great variety of climate. Along the coast it is hot and
moist, while it is cool and salubrious in the mountainous
districts. The staple products are wheat, corn, and tobacco.
Coal and iron are abundant, and salt and sulphur springs are
very numerous.

LYNCHBURG is ﬁnely situated on elevated ground, on the
south bank of James River. It is one of the largest, most
wealthy, and busy towns in the state.

Petersburg, situated on the south bank of Appomattox
River, is a handsome and ﬂourishing town. Large quantities
of ﬂour and tobacco are exported from this place.

NORTH CAROLINA.

Area in square miles, 45,500. Population, 869,000. Inhabitants to a square mile, 19.
Counties, 82.

i This state is naturally divided into three distinct physical
sections; the eastern, or seaward section, consisting for the
most part of a low, level, and sandy plain, abounding in
marshes, and interspersed here and there with shallow lakes ;
the middle section, which is hilly, or gently undulating; and
the western section, a mountainous region forming an elevated
table—land.

The coast of North Carolina is skirted by a range of low,
sandy islands, surrounded by shoals, which render navigation
exceedingly dangerous. The Great Dismal Swamp, partly in
the N.E. part of this state and partly in Virginia, covers a
surface of 100,000 acres. This swamp is mostly covered with
cedar, pine, and cypress trees.

Much of the low sandy section, which extends from the
coast about sixty miles inland, is covered with vast forests of
pitch pine, that furnish not only lumber, but large quantities
of tar, turpentine, and resin. In the interior of the state
the soil is productive and highly favourable to agricultural
pursuits. I

THE SOUTHERN STATES. . 183

The climate is hot and unhealthy in the ‘summer, on the
coast, but cooler and more salubrious in the more elevated
districts. ,

Cotton, rice, and indigo grow well in the eastern lowlands;
the higher grounds are adapted to the growth of grains,
fruits, &c. The staple products are Indian corn, tobacco, and
sweet potatoes. This state is rich in minerals, especially gold.
Tar, pitch, and turpentine are exported in large quantities.

' Raleigh is the capital. Its situation is both elevated and .

healthy. In the centre of the city is Union Square, in which
stands the State House, a splendid building, built after the
model of the Parthenon at Athens in Greece. The North
Carolina Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, recently estab-
lished at this place, is also worthy of notice.

Newbern is a place of considerable trade. The exports are
lumber, grain, tar, pitch, turpentine, and resin.

Beaufort is noted as possessing the best harbour in the
state, and has considerable trade.

WILMINGTON is the largest and most commercial city in
the state. ’

Charlotte is one of the principal towns in the western part
of the state, and is near the gold mines. A Mint is estab-
lished here for the purpose of coining the gold.

Fayetteville is the centre of an extensive trade. The town
possesses ample water power, which is employed in the manu-
facture of cotton and ﬂour. The articles of export are the
products of the pine.

SOUTH CAROLINA.

Area in square miles, 28,000. Population, 669,000. Inhabitants to a. square mile, 23.
Districts, 29.

The coast, from 80 to 100 miles inland, is covered with
forests of pitch pine, interspersed with numerous swampy tracts.
The climate is similar to that of North Carolina, but the state
being further south, it partalges in a greater degree of the
tropical character. Cotton and rice are the great staples. Of

184 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

the minerals, gold, iron, and lead are the most important. The
gold is obtained from the same belt (extending from the Rap-
pahannook River to the Coosa) in which the gold of Virginia,
North Carolina, and Georgia is found. -

The exports are cotto11 and rice. There is more rice ex-'
ported from this state thanfrom‘ all the other states together.
Lumber and naval stores are also largely exported.

Columbia, the capital, is beautifully ornamented with nume-
rous trees. The site of the city is considerably elevated,
affording extensive views of the surrounding country, which
is chieﬂy a cotton and corn region, in the highest state of
culture. The South Carolina College is located at this
place.

Georgetown, a port of entry, is noted for its coasting trade.

CHARLESTON, the metropolis and principal seaport, is situated
on a peninsula between Ashley and Cooper Rivers, which unite
below the city and form a spacious harbour, about seven miles
from the ocean.

This city has been made remarkable among all the cities of
the world, by the important military events that have trans-
pired there during the war for the independence of the
South. . .

The streets are, in some quarters, lined with the “Pride of
India” and other trees. Many of the houses‘ are beautifully
ornamented with verandal1_s, reaching from the ground to the
roof, and surrounded by gardens, profusely adorned with orange
trees, magnolias, palmettos, &c. .

This city contains several educational, literary, and other
institutions, among which are the State Medical College, the
Charleston College, the City Hall, and the Orphan Asylum.

"Hamburg is a noted cotton mart, and has a large inland
trade. It lies opposite Augusta, Georgia, with which it is
connected by a bridge which crosses the Savannah at this
place. ’

Camden, a ﬂourishing town, is remarkable for the battles
fought in its vicinity during the Revolution of 177 6.

THE SOUTHERN STATES. 185

GEORGIA.
Area in square mi1es,58,000. Population, 906,000. Inhabitants toasquare mile, 15.
Counties, 112.

This state, like South Carolina, may be divided into three
sections, viz.: the alluvial ﬂats which extend from the ocean
inland about 100 miles; the sand-hill belt, or pine barrens,
extending inland to the lower falls of the rivers ; and the hilly
or mountainous tract of the north and north-west. The Blue
Ridge crosses near the western edge of the state.

The coast is lined with a succession of low islands, which
are covered with rich plantations, and produce, in great quan-
tities, the long staple cotton, called Sea Island cotton.

Along the southern line of Georgia is Okefenokee Swamp,

which extends over the border into Florida. This swamp is
the abode of numerous ‘alligators, frogs, lizards, cranes, 850.
V In the north part of the state the valleys are exceedingly
rich; in the south are the tide and swamp lands favourable to
the growth of rice, and about 60 or 7 0 miles from the coast are
the pine lands, which are valuable chieﬂy for the timber
annually yielded. The middle region is well adapted to the
production of tobacco, cotton, and grain.

The winters are pleasant, but the summers are very hot.
The sickly season is during the months of July, August, and
September. —

The staple product is cotton. Rice, Indian corn, tobacco,
and sweet potatoes» are cultivated. Coffee, sugar, and tropical
fruits and plants are produced in some sections of the state.
Of minerals, gold is found in the north, and iron-ore in various
parts of the state. I

This state has made considerable advances in the establish-
ment of manufactures. Those of cotton, iron, and gunpowder
are the most important. The articles of export are cotton,
rice, lumber, and naval stores. ‘

Milleclgeville, the capital, is built on elevated ground, sur-
rounded by a beautiful and fertile cotton country, and is the
centre of a’ considerable trade. The State House and State

186 A GEOGRAPHY ron BEGINNERS.

Arsenal situated in State House Square, near the centre of the
city, are the prominent public buildings. ,

Augusta, situated on the west bank of..the Savannah 231 miles
from its mouth, ranks the second in the state in population.
It is the depot of an extensive and fertile country, the pro-
duce of which, consisting chieﬂy of tobacco and cotton, is
sent by railway to Charleston, or is carried down the river to
Savannah.

SAVANNAH, the largest and most commercial" city in the state,
lies on the right or west bank of Savannah River, about 18
miles above its mouth. The streets are regularly laid out;
after every second street there is a public square. These are
generally enclosed and ornamented with the China tree.

Fort Gaines, situated on a high bluff on the left bank of the
Chattahoochee River, is the mart for the sale and shipment of
cotton in that section of the state.

Columbus is the third city of the state in population and
wealth. A bridge crosses the river at this place. A large
number of steamboats ply on the river, carrying cotton and
other produce to the sea-board and to New Orleans.

Macon is a ﬂourishing city. A large amount of cotton is
shipped from this place.

FLORIDA.

Area in square miles, 59,260. Population, 87 ,000. Inhabitants to a square mile, 1.
Counties, 30.

This state occupies a peninsula south of Alabama and
Georgia, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.
It is 385 miles long, and from 50 to 250 wide. Though the
length of sea-coast is above 1,000 miles, yet there are but
few good harbours. " -

It is generally level; a range of low hills extends through
the peninsula. The Everglades in the south of Florida cover
an extent of about 160 miles in length by 60 in breadth.
They are like a vast lake studded with thousands of islands,
being marshy thickets interspersed with meadows and ponds.

The soil presents a. rich and fertile appearance on the banks

THE SOUTHERN STATES. 187

of the rivers; and for the space of 30 or 40 miles from the
coast there is scarcely to be seen a stone weighing more than
two or three pounds. There is much marshy soil, but the pine-
barrens constitute a great portion of the country. The hum-
mocks, or mounds, among the pines are usually fertile.

As this state approaches Within a degree and a half of the
torrid zone, its climate possesses many tropical characteristics.
It very rarely freezes; nor is the cold so severe as to injure
even the orange trees. The air is pure and free from fogs, but
the dews are generally excessive.

Among the productions are cotton, Indian corn, sugar-cane,
rice, and tobacco. The fruits are varied and abundant; oranges,
lemons, figs, pomegranates, pine—apples, olives, grapes, &c.
The whole country abounds in various kinds of game, and the
surrounding Waters yield the finest ﬁsh. Alligators are abun-
dant on the shores of the inlets and rivers, and gnatsfand mos-
quitoes are both numerous and troublesome. I .

The town of St. Augustine Was settled in 1564, so that it is
by many years the oldest settlement in the American States.
It is situated about two miles distant from the ocean, on an
inlet called Matanzas Sound. The mildness of the climate
and the refreshing sea-breezes render this a place of great
resort for invalids during the Winter season.

Key West is situated on an island of the same name, one of
the group called the Florida Keys. '

This town is of importance, being the key to the northern
passage to the Gulf of Mexico, which is safer, and ninety miles
nearer, than round the Tortugas group.

The principal business transacted here is derived from the
salvages and other perquisites of Wrecked vessels. Consider-
able quantities of salt are manufactured on the island, and
sponges are procured and exported in large numbers.

Tallahassee, the capital, is situated on a commanding emi-
nence, about 20 miles north of its port, St. Mark’s, with Which
it is connected by railroad.

PENSACOLA, the principal port and city in Florida, is situated

188 A GEOGRAPHY roa BEGINNERS.

on the west shore of Pensacola Bay. About six miles below
the city is the navy yard, covering nearly eighty acres of
ground, and enclosed by a high brick wall.

' Appalachicola is located_on a bluff atthe west side of the
mouth of Appalachicola River. The harbour is accessible by
steamboats from the gulf, and large quantities of cotton are
shipped at this place.

ALABAMA.

Area in square miles, 50,700. Population, 77 2,000. Inhabitants to a square mile, 15.
Counties, 52.

The length of the state is about 330 miles, and its breadth
varies from 140 to 210 miles. Length of sea-coast about 60

' miles.

The northern part is mountainous, though not very elevated.
The Alleghany Range terminates in this section of the state.
Southxof the mountainous district the surface gradually declines
to the Gulf of Mexico. The extreme southern portions of the
state are level and but little elevated above the surface of the
ocean. ~
In the ﬂats between the low mountains on the north the soil
is good. The central part of the state is occupied chieﬂy by
fertile prairies, and the southern consists of prairies and pine-
barrens, interspersed with alluvial river bottoms of great fertility.

The climate is similar to that of Georgia. Running water
is rarely ever frozen, and cattle require no shelter.

Cotton is the great staple. Indian corn, Wheat, oats, rice,
live stock, butter, and sweet potatoes are produced in large
quantities. The sugar-cane grows in the south-west part of the
state. i '

Cotton manufactures have been introduced with considerable
success. The commerce of the state consists chieﬂy in the
exportation of articles of domestic produce. ‘

The mineral resources consist of iron, coal, and marble.

l\/_lontgon1ery, the capital, is situated on a high bluff, on the
left bank of Alabama River, at the western termination of the

THE SOUTHERN STATES. 189

Montgomery and West Point Railroad. The surrounding coun-
try is one of tlie richest cotton regions of the state ; and large
quantities’ of this article are shipped from this port.

Florence, on the north bank -of Tennessee River, at the head
of steamboat navigation, is a principal shipping port in the north,
and does an extensive business in proportion to the population.

Eufaula is a place of considerable trade, chieﬂy in cotton.

MOBILE is the principal commercial mart of the state. Next
to New Orleans, it is the chief port for the export of cotton.

Steamboats ply between this port and New Orleans, by way
of Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain.

Tuscaloosa, on the left bank of Black Wa1°rior River, at the
head of steamboat navigation, is noted for its literary institutions
and for its active trade. The University of Alabama is located
here. I

MISSISSIPPI.

Area in square miles, 47,150. Population, 607,000. Inhabitants to a square mile, 12.
Counties, 60.

Its greatest length is‘ about 400 miles, and its average
breadth about 150.

Numerous ranges of hills give to a part of the surface an
undulating and diversiﬁed character. In the north the land is
hilly and broken; in the eastern and central parts it is a kind
of table-land, descending towards the Mississippi, sometimes
approaching close to the river’s brink and overhanging it in
precipices of from one to two hundred feet in height. In the
south for about 100 miles from the Gulf of Mexico it is Inostly

' level, covered with pine forests, interspersed with cypress

swamps, prairies, and a few low hills. The general slope of
the state is south-west.

The valleys of the northern and central portions of the state
are exceedingly fertile. In the south-east the soil is mostly
sandy, interspersed with a few fertile tracts.

The summers are long and hot, but the winters are several
degrees colder than in the Atlantic States of the same latitude.

Cotton is the staple. Indian corn, rice, bananas, sweet

the western part.

The great delta of the Mississippi, included within the
Atchafalaya and the Amite, and extending over about one-
fourth part of the state, is not, for the most part, elevated
more than ten feet above the level of the Gulf of Mexico, and
is annually inundated by the spring ﬂoods. Only about one-
twentieth part of the surface of the state is under cultivation.

Texas is divided into three regions; the level, the undu-
lating, and the mountainous, or hilly. The level region occu-
pies the coast, extending from thirty to sixty miles into the
interior; the undulating succeeds this, and embraces a belt
of land of about 200 miles in width, which is followed by the
mountainous or hilly, tract of the north andhnorth-west. The
coast is lined with a chain of low islands.

The general character of the soil is that of fertility. There
are few countries, of the same extent, possessing as little unpro-

-ductive land as Texas.

The climate, freed from the extremes of both the torrid and
temperate zones, is mild and salubrious. "Snow is seldom
seen except on the mountains. Cotton is the great staple of
the state. The soil, whether upland or lowland, woodland or
prairie, seems admirably adapted to its culture.

19.8 A GEOGRAPHY. FOR BEGINNERS.

The Atlantic Slope extends from the ocean, part being a
level country for some 50 or 100 miles inland ; there it begins

-to rise, and gradually increases in elevation till it terminates

in the Alleghanies, which separate the waters that ﬁow'west-
wardly to the Mississippi from those which ﬂow eastwardly to
the Atlantic.

The Valley of the Mississippi comprises that portion of the

United States lying between the Alleghany Ridge and the
Rocky Mountains. The central part of that Valley is inter-

sected by the Mississippi River, which flows through the Con-

‘federate States in a southerly direction, and ﬁnds its outlet in

the Gulf of Mexico. ,
The Paciﬁc Slope extends westward from the Rocky Moun-

tain Range to the Paciﬁc Ocean. This slope is considerably
"diversiﬁed by many minor mountainranges and numerous hills.

The inhabitants consist of whites, negroes and Indians.
The whites are of European descent, and form the greater
part of the population. The negroes are of African descent;
and the Indians are the aboriginals. The English is the lan-

abounds in large and fertile prairies,‘which are here andthere
skirted with wood. These prairies, are gently undulating, and
decked with beautiful wild ﬂowers of almost every hue.

The soil is fertile ; the climate is healthy and milder than
in the Atlantic states lying in the same latitude. The.staple
products of this state are Indian corn, wheat, oats, hay-,
butter, cheese, and potatoes. Berries and table-fruits are
abundant.

Lead, coal, and iron-ore are abundant- Salt springs, from

which large quantities of "salt are manufactured, exist in the
southern part of the state.

This state was settled by the French. At the close of the
war which gave to Great Britain the province of Canada,
Illinois was ceded by France to the English.

Agriculture is the leading pursuit, and the capabilities of the
State in this respect are unsurpassed by any other State in the
Union. »-

Springﬁeld,,the capital, is located on the border of a large
and beautiful prairie,. about three miles south of the Sangamon,
and 230 miles south-west of Chicago.

Galena is the metropolis of the lead region of northern

Illinois. I I

CHICAGO, the most populous and commercial city in the
state, is built on a level plain, elevated about five feet ab_ove
the surface of the lake.

Chicago is thegreat shipping depot of an immense and
fertile region, and communicates by a daily line of steamers
with Buffalo, and other intermediate ports on the lakes.

Peoria is an important commercial city of Illinois. A
drawbridge (2,500 feet long) spans the Illinois River at this
place.

The southern part is hilly. The remainder of the state is
level, interspersed here and there with extensive prairies and
rich bottom—lands, thickly studded with forests. The general
inclination of the surface is toward the Ohio.

The soil is fertile, and the climate is similar to that of
Illinois. Indian corn is the staple product. Other products
are wheat, oats, potatoes, fruits, butter, live-stock, wool, and
maple sugar. Of minerals, coal and iron—ore are the most
important.

This state was settled by the French. In 1800, it, together
with Illinois, was erected into the Indian territory; and, six-
teen years after, was admitted into the Union as an independent
state.

Agriculture forms the chief employment. In the south-
eastern part of the state, the vine is successfully cultivated by
a company of Swiss settlers. »

Indiana carries on an active lake and river trade. The
articles of export are live—stock, pork, beef, lard, Indian corn,
wheat, and wool.

Indianapolis, the capital, is the terminus of several railroads.
A bridge spans the river White at this place. ‘

Fort Wayne is the business depot of a fertile section of country.

Madison is a place of commercialiimportance. It is noted
for its extensive establishments for packing pork. '

NEW ALBANY is a commercial city. Steamboat building is
more extensively carried on at this place than at any other
port on the Ohio.

La Fayette is the principal grain market in the state.

CALIFORNIA.

Area in square miles, 189,000. Population, 300,000. Inhabitants to a square mile, 1.
Counties, 36. -
A portion of the state is traversed by mountain ranges.
The valley of the Sacramento and ‘San Joaquin extends from
north to south about 500 miles, with an average breadth of
about sixty miles. This valley is bounded on the east by the
Sierra Nevada, and on the west by the Coast Range of moun-
tains. On the western slope‘ of the former are the gold mines
of California.
The soil in the valleys is fertile. The climate is noted for
its periodical changes, and the year is divided into two seasons

.-——the wet and the dry. The wet season (in the latitude of

San Francisco) lasts from the middle of November to the
middle of ’ May.

The products are barley, wheat, potatoes and fruits. Oats
grow wild, and grapes ﬂourish in all parts of the state. Fish
are fine and abundant. Wild animals inhabit some sections
of the state.

In the abundance of its minerals, particularly of gold,
California is rich. The quicksilver mine of New Almaden,
about thirteen miles south of San J osé, is probably the richest

‘ in the world.

C THE WESTERN STATES.   221

Among the most remarkable curiosities are the hot Sulphur
springs, situated about ninety miles north of Benicia. They
are from one to nine feet in diameter, and constantly eject
Water, in a boiling state, to the height of ten or ﬁfteen
feet. _

California was colonized by the Spanish. In 1822,
became a province of the Republic of Mexico; and in 1848,
Mexico ceded it to the United States. Mining is the lead-
ing industrial pursuit. Commerce receives considerable at-

, tention.

Manufactures are few.

Sacramento city, the capital, situated on the left bank of
Sacramento River, is a noted commercial port of California,
being accessible for steamers and vessels of a large Size.

SAN FRANCISCO, the great commercial metropolis of Califor-
nia, lies on the West side of San "Francisco Bay. Its com-
merce is extensive. The entrance to this city from the ocean
is through a narrow Strait, about one mile in Width and four
miles long, called the “ Golden Gate.”

Benicia, situated on Karquenas Strait, which connects the
Waters of San Pablo and Suisun Bays, contains an arsenal, a
navy yard, and large docks, for the repairing and reﬁtting of
steamers. Marysville, on the right bank of Yuba River, is a
convenient place of resort for the miners during the rainy
season.

 

0 SECTION XLIX.——-The Territories.

THE TERRITORY OF WASHINGTON.
Area in square miles, 113,820. Population, 10,000.

The Soil is fertile, except in the mountain districts ; and the
climate is remarkably mild for so high a latitude. It Was
formerly a part of Oregon.

222 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

THE TERRITORY or NEBRASKA.
Area in square miles, 528,720. Population, 50,000.

From the Missouri westward to the base of the Rocky
Mountain Range the surface is one vast rolling prairie, here
and there diversiﬁed by a stream of water. These prairies
afford an inexhaustible supply of pasturage for cattle. Count~
less herds of bison, elk and deer are to be found in this
territory.

THE TERRITORY or MINNESOTA.
Area in square miles, 141,840. Population, 100,000.

It is the most elevated tract of land between the Gulf of
Mexico and Hudson Bay. Its surface is an elevated table-land,
mostly occupied by prairies, watered by numerous streams and
lakes. The soil is adapted to agricultural purposes.’

St. Paul, the capital of the territory, is situated at the head
of steam navigation on the Mississippi, about 2,000 miles
distant from the Gulf of Mexico, and fourteen miles below the
celebrated Fallsof St. Anthony.

The perpendicular pitch of these Falls is seventeen feet ; but
including the rapids above and below, the entire descent in one
mile is estimated at sixty-ﬁve feet. An island at the brow of
the precipice divides the current into two ‘parts, the larger of
which passes on the west side of the island.

THE TERRITORY OF UTAH.

Area in square miles, 187 ,920. Population, 20,000.

That part of the territory lying west of the valley of
the Colorado is denominated the Great Basin, and forms a
distinct region». One peculiarity of this section is, that all
its rivers terminate within its limits, in lakes that have no
visible outlets. The valleys are fertile, but most of the land is
barren. V _

Grain and garden vegetables are the products. The inha-
bitants are chieﬂy Mormons.

THE TERRITORIES. 223

THE TERRITORY OF OREGON.

‘Area in square miles, 227,640. Population, 25,000.

The surface is mountainous, but it abounds in fertile valleys.
Wheat is the staple procluction. Oregon is noted for forests of
gigantic pine trees. The exports are lumber, live stock, and
ﬂour. '

Salem is one of the most important towns in the territory.

and vapour, burst‘ upwards through -the crust of the earth’s
surfac_e, and exposed many strata of minerals and rock, which
aide very valuable to mankind. . By this «means, immense beds
of coal are exposed, which Divine Providence had prepared,
after the Genesis, and many thousands of years before Adam,
While as yet the surface of the earth Was unﬁt for the use
of mankind. Immense stores of iron, lead, copper, &c. are
also thus lifted up and exposed for man’s use. Gold, and
silver, and other precious metals, and various kinds of stones
used in buildingand agriculture, are thus uplifted, and ready
for use.

There are two kinds of coal, one ofvvhich is found near
Richmond, Va. ; and the other in Pennsylvania. The Rich-
mond coal burns with smoke like tar or bitumen, and is called

_ “bituminous coal ;” the other burns Without smoke, and is
. called “ anthracite ; ” the anthracite is also called “ hard coal.”

The upheaving of these mountain ranges also occasioned all
the diversity of hill and valley, and Water-fall, &c., which adorn
and beautify the scenery, conduce to health, and aid the farmer
and the manufacturer in his work.

The variety of elevation thus produced, causes also a variety
of climate; so that, in.Texas and Mexico, people can change
the hot climate of the torrid zone,’ to the pleasant air of our
spring-time, by merely ascending the slope of a mountain or
table land. a

the country between them, nearly all the water that is shed
from. the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, and nearly
all that comes from the western slope of the Alleghanies, ﬁnds
its outlet, through the Mississippi River, to the Gulf of
Mexico.

This is the longest, if not the largest, riverof the world.
From its extreme sources, where the Missouri rises among the
Rocky Mountains, or where the Mississippi branch approaches
the British possessions on the north, ‘to the Gulf of Mexico, is
about 4,000 miles. And its tributaries, which are very numer-
ous, are themselves larger than many of the great rivers of
other lands. The Ohio, which empties into the Mississippi,
1,000 miles fromits mouth, is navigable for 1,000 miles
above that point. The Tennessee, which empties into the
Ohio, is navigable about 800 miles. _

The principal branches of the Mississippi, that shed the
water of the Rocky Mountains, are the following :— 0

SECTION VII.—-Lakes of N orth America, and its Inland Seas.

North America is remarkable among all the countries of the
earth for its beautiful and magniﬁcent lakes and inland seas.

You will perceive upon the map a chain of large bodies of
fresh water connected by navigable water-courses, and extend-
ing over a district of country more than 1,000 miles in length.

These lakes are surrounded by fertile lands, mineral tracts
of inexhaustible supply of the most useful metals and stone,
and forests of the most valuable kinds of timber. They also
contain plentiful supplies of the ﬁnest ﬁsh.

Lake Superior spreads over a surface of nearly 50,000 square
miles, which is about equal to the whole extent of England.

Lake Michigan is nearly 400 miles in length.

This immense system of lakes and inland seas and bays
puriﬁes the air, conveys the rich "products of the country to
distant markets, and moderates the climate.

There are, also, innumerable small lakes and ponds scattered
profusely over the country, from the Atlantic to the Rocky
Mountains, but chieﬂy conﬁned to the northern latitudes.

There are three means by which vessels can sail from any
port on Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean.

1. via the Mississippi River.

2. via the Hudson River.

3. via the St. Lawrence River.

The foregoing lakes abound in ﬁsh andwater-fowl of many
varieties and superior quality, which afford an easy and a fasci-
nating mode of living to thousands of Indians, French Cana-
dians, and persons from all parts of the world, who are fond of
a wild and exciting life.   H i

Their shores and rivers abound with beaver, foxes, deer,
otters, and other animals, which are trapped or hunted for their
fur as well as for food. 1

Hundreds of tons of game are transmitted eastward every
fall and winter.

Their shores are also rich in the most valuable "kinds of
metals. and minerals ; which are easy of access to the miner,

and of transportation to the merchant. Some of the neigh-

bouring regions have their climates moderated by the Lakes,
both in summer and winter. From this cause the State of
Michigan, lying between Lakes Huron and Michigan is a ﬁne
fruit country. ' r

The lake region also abounds in every variety of beautiful
scenery ; from the mingled grandeur and beauty of Niagara to
the charm and loveliness thrown around the rich and delightful

lands of Minnesota, where little lakelets are scattered among“

the hills and valleys like gems, onlyimore precious and fair.

On Lake Huron the traveller from Europe is frequently
surprised at beholding ahundred sail of vessels at one time,
and many of them square riggecl. Nor is he less surprised
when he enters Lake Michigan, at ﬁnding the most extensive
Zumlver mart of the world; the largest grain market; and
among the largest markets for pork, cattle, &c.

SECTION VIII.-—--IsZa'nds.

Islands are T of four kinds :———1st, T those which date their

origin and formation coeval with continents ; 2nd, such as
have been formed by the delta of rivers, or by the changing.
currents of rivers and seas ; 8rd, those, which are the result_
of volcanic action, lifting them up from beneath the sea ; 4th,
those which are made by a small insect, and called “the coral
islands.” We might add a 5th kind ;——-those which, being
made by insects, below the surface of the sea, have been sub-'
sequently raised up by volcanic action. The Bermuda or Somers
Islands, about 300 in number, are examples of the last kind.
_ The principal portion of these beautiful islands, which are
the beauty and the glory of the western margin of “the
Sargasso Sea,” was made by the coral insect ; the remaining
part is a kind of limestone, made by other small insects ; and
the whole" has been lifted up from beneath the sea, by volcanic
action. The coral of those islands is a light friable substance,
easily sawn into blocks, and used, not only to‘ construct. the.
walls of houses and churches, but is also sawn into tiles one inch’
thick, fourteen long, and eleven wide, with which the people.
cover their dwellings. This gives the delightful little town of
St. George’s a unique appearance, as you approach it through
the windings of its intricate harbour. For the -coral, beneath
the deep clear water of the sea, changes its. colour into a
bright and lovely green ; while the town with .its coral roofs is
white ; and its gardens, being ﬁlled with the luxuriant verdure
of a tropical island, are blooming with ﬂowers of every variety;
of colour and fragrance, interspersed with trees full of fruit.

22 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

SECTION IX.——Minerczls, Metals, cﬁc,

The most useful metals and minerals have been provided

_by the omniscient Creator of the World, in the largest quan-

tities; and such are not only most easy of access, but most
generally distributed over the surface of the earth.

Iron is undoubtedly the ﬁrst in rank both in its usefulness
and general distribution.

Man could better part With all other metals than with
iron. When carbonised and made into Watch-Wire, it com-
mands a far higher price than gold.

North America combines the three great advantages of pos-
sessing the largest amount and the best kinds of iron, While it
is most easy of access. In the State of Missouri there are
iron mountains Where the Whole body of the hills is composed
of very pure iron ore.

The Lake Superior mineral region presents the same

quantities and readiness of access, While its iron is more

malleable and softer than any other kind in the world. The
iron made in Russia .and Austria is justly celebrated for its
quality and superiority for manufacturing.

The iron mines of Great Britain furnish an annual supply
of nearly four million tons. .

In fact, iron-stone is to be found profusely underlying much
of the surface of the earth.

The next in rank among minerals is Coal.

This valuable substance bears stamped upon its face, in the
plainest language, its vegetable origin. The exact impressions
of fern leaves—-the shape and forms of tropical plants, &c.-—
are frequently to be found both on the coal itself, in its
substance, and on the strata of slate or other matters that
overlie it.

A Wise Providence occupied many ages before the creation
of man, as stated by Moses in the book of Genesis, in pre
paring these substances for man’s use. * '

Coal is almost as extensively provided over the earth’s sur-

MINERALS, METALS, ETC. 23 ,

face as iron. The Belgian mines yield nearly nine million
tons every year. America takes the first rank in abundance
of supply, excellence of quality, and readiness of access to
coal measures.

The largest quantity of coal annually derived from mines,
by any one nation, is that in Great Britain. It is equal to
about sixty-six million tons.

It is impossible to state the exact amount mined annually in
America, but it must be more than twenty-ﬁve million tons.

On the upper branches of the Delaware river there are
extensive mines of anthracite, or hard coal.

In Western Virginia there are inexhaustible beds of cannel
coal; and in Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and upon many of
the western rivers which empty into the Ohio and Mississippi,
the coal appears in strata of six and eight feet along the sides
of the hills, where, in some cases, it can be mined and thrown
directly into the cars and waggons that convey it to market.
At such places the coal is delivered at 1.75 dollars, or about
73.  sterling a ton. ’ ‘

Copper and lead are not so extensively distributed over the
earth; but amines exist in many places, and provide those
metals in sufﬁcieiit quantity for the uses of mankind.

The copper region of -Lake Superior is a vast substratum of
pure copper, in masses of many tons’ weight, mixed with ores
of copper and other metals.

The lead regions of the Mississippi and Missouri valleys are
inexhaustible, and often superﬁcial.

Tin is, as yet, found in few places. The supply is chieﬂy
from the mines of Cornwall, England, and the Island of Banca,
in the South Asiatic Archipelago. s

The other metals and minerals are distributed as follows,——

Mercury: Mexico, Austria, Spain, California, China, &c.

Gold California, and the Northern Rocky Mountains,
Brazil, Siberia, Australia, 850.

,Zi»nc : Everywhere.

Silver; Peru, Mexico, 850..

24 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

Salt: The ocean; the mines of England, Poland, 650‘.

Well as in sea Water, all over the earth3s surface.

For the distance of some 23 degrees north and south of the

equator there is a zone, or belt of the earth, in which nearly

all tropical vegetation ﬂourishes in great luxuriance in the
low, rich, Wet lands; and to a less extent as you ascend the

SECTION XII.,———-Bz'9~cls.

The Birds of the tropics are generally larger, and their
plumage more beautiful, than those of other regions; but in
the temperate zone the variety is perhaps greater.

Birds of prey seem to subserve most valuable purposes-‘tin
the economy of Nature. The governments of nations whose
home is in warm climates often protect them by law. Thus
you will_ see the vulture of India, and the Turkey-buzzard of
Carolina, tamely and quietly devouring the dead carcases of
animals in the streets of cities. Crows" and blackbirds consume
large quantities of worms and insects, which would else destroy
the farmers’ crops; and they often prey upon ' snakes, reptiles,
mice, &c.

The Condor, which lives amid the cold regions of the higher
Andes, ﬁnds its food in the more fertile region below him, and
thus grows to an enormous size, and is long-lived. The North
American eagle is not so large, but is swifter and more
active in ﬂight, and a more noble bird. This bird changes into
the Lammer-geyer, or great eagle of the Alps, in Europe.

I The polar regions have no need of the buzzard and the
beetle, for the carcases of dead animals do not corrupt the air
in cold regions. Amid the polar regions birds become fewer
in number and kind. The Eider-duck, the soft downy feathers
of which are so celebrated, and other sea fowls, are the most
numerous of arctic birds. But there are kinds of migratory
birds, called “birds of passage,” that spend the summer in
the higher latitudes, and the winter nearer the tropics. Such
are the swan, the wild goose, wild ducks, wild pigeons, chimney

’ martins, it &c. — ' ‘

. It is interesting to observe how their Creator has given
them a law, called “instinct,” which they seldom transgress,
and which is unerring in its action. At the appointed season
they all leave their northern home, where they were born and
raised, and seek the unknown regions of a‘ milder climate.
And when spring-time comes, they wing their ﬂight back again

whence they came." And if they remain too long, or return too
soon, as the Robin sometimes does, they often perish with cold

or want of food. .

SECTION XIII.--Zlfcm.

The highest and noblest of the Creator’s Works is Man.

The earth, with its treasures of mineral wealth, its vegetable
and animal kingdoms, and its movements and relations to the
sun, the moon, and the stars of heaven, causing the grateful
‘changes of night and day, seed-time and harvest, -summer and
winter,- the rise and fall of tides, &c., was made and prepared
by the Creator as a residence and home for man.

“ In the beginning God‘ created the heavens and the earth.”

The heavens were the home of angels.

But for many ages the earth remained an empty black crust
of cooling lava. “The earth was without form and void, and
darkness was upon the face of‘ the deep.”

“ And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,
And God said, LET THERE BE LIGHT ; and there was light.
And God saw the light that it was good.” As soon as God

. made the light, vegetable and animal life also came into being.

30 A enoenarnr ron BEGINNERS.

And, during many ages, all those changes in the earth’s crust
were taking place which are now so valuable to man.

But there was no summer or winter; there were none of
the higher and nobler animals, or vegetation. c

When everything was thus prepared, “ God divided the
light from the darkness, and God called the light DAY, and
the darkness he called NIGHT. And the eveining and the
m07‘m'ng were the ﬁrst day.”

Day and night are caused by the motion of the earth revolving
on its axis. “

During the successive days of a week, the Creator called

into being all the higher orders of vegetables and animals, and

arranged the inﬂuences of the heavenly bodies upon the earth,
and having thus prepared it for man’s residence, “ GOD MADE
MAN IN Hrs OWN IMAGE.”

“ And God put man in the garden which he had planted,
and God said, Let them have dominion over the ﬁsh of the
sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
all the earth, and over every living thing that moveth upon the
earth.”

“ And God saw everything that he had made ; and,‘ behold,
it was very good. And the evening and the morning were
the sixth day.”

“And on the seventh day, God ended his work which he
had made  And God blessed the seventh day, and sancti-
ﬁed it, because that in it he had restedfrom all his work.”

QUESTIONS.

Who or what is God’s noblest work ?

For what purpose did the Creator store
away iron, coal, precious metals, and
stones in the earth’s crust ?

For whom do the trees, ﬂowers, and fruit
grow ?

SECTION XIV.——Dim'sions of the Humcm Race.

For some two ‘thousand years mankind multiplied exceedingly,
throughout the earth. And in those days men lived much
longer, and grew to a larger size than they do now.

But, in process of time, men became so wicked and corrupt
before God, that He sent a deluge upon the earth, and
destroyed man and beast from off the face of the whole
earth.

Noah, and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, were saved
in the Ark which God had directed them to build; and with
them such animals as God selected.

“ And of them the whole earth was overspread.”

As God had set His bow in the cloud as a sign andiseal of
His covenant with Noah, that “ He would not again destroy all
ﬂesh from off the earth,” it became necessary that He should
adopt some other means by which to check the universal
tendency of mankind to impiety and wickedness. He there-
fore divided the speech or languages of men at “Babel.

By this means, and by the diverse climates in which men
live, and their different modes of life, nations have been kept
distinct; and men have become separated into races, of dif-
ferent colour, as well as "government.

A hereditary government is one in which the supreme
authority descends from father to son, or, if there be no son,
to the next nearest relative.

An elective government is ‘one in which the head of the
Government-is elected by the people, or by electors chosen by
the people. i _ _

Again, governments are divided into absolute and limited.
An absolute government is one in which the will of the sovereign
is the law of ‘the land, and he is unrestrained by a Written
constitution, or by other laws. ‘ " i

A limited ‘government. is one in. which the power of the

SECTION XVIII.———-H2'story of the Oonfeclemte States.

The State of VIRGINIA was a colony of Great Britain, whose

first settlement at J amestown‘ dated A.D. 1607, a few years’

before the colony at Quebec, and some thirteen years earlier
than that of the Puritans in Massachusetts. The Colonial
Grovernment continued down to the year 1776, when, in the
month of May, and from 6th to 13th_of that month, measures
were adopted for securing its independence.

It received the term “ Old, Dominion” during the civil wars
in England, when it acted as an independent State, andlrefused
to. recognize the authority. of Cromwell; in consequence of

'which.King Charles the Second had the arms of Virginia

quartered with those of England, Scotland, and Ireland upon
certain coins, which, though rare, are still extant.

‘When Virginia adopted the Federal Constitution of I the
United States in 1788, the Commissioners of the State were
directed to annex the condition and reservation of the right
to withdraw from the Federation at will. I

In the exercise of 6 this reserved right, Virginia withdrew
from the United States in the year 1861 ; and also refused to
allow the troops of the Northern States to pass through her
territory to subjugate the other States which had already
seceded. She was formally received into the Southern Con-
federacy, thenrepresented in Montgomery, Aa., and became:
the principal seat of the war of Southern Independence.

Virginia held the title to all the lands west of Pennsylvania,
and as far south as N. lat. 36°. She ceded these lands to the
United States ; and a large portion of them have been settled
by her surplus population.

OLD STATE HOUSE, NORTH CAROLINA.

A Southern colony was formed under Governor‘Ye'amans, and-’
the two assumed the titles of NORTH and SOUTH CAROLINA.

On the 19th April, 1775, in Mecklenburg county, at
Charlotte, North Carolina’, resolutions were passed, declaring
the State “free and independent.”

“Oyster Point,” near ‘Charleston, South Carolina, was ﬁrst
occupied by a colony under William Sayle, 1670 ; and in 1674
Joseph West was elected the governor of the colony.

The colony received accessions of Wealth and character
from the Cavaliers,‘ Huguenots, Scotch, and Irish, who settled
among them.

V,/'7 The ﬁrst decided outbreak of the Revolution of 1776'
 ‘occurred in Charleston, on the occasion of the unjustifiable
 arrest and imprisonment of Robert Cunningham, in November,
1"; 1775.

The ﬁrst collision of the War for Independence of the‘
Southern States occurred at Charleston, in the spring of
1861, and was occasioned by the President, elected by the
citizens of the Northern States, attempting to seize, provision,
and occupy the forts in Charleston Harbour, and turn their
guns upon the city they were designed to protect.

GEORGIA formerly embraced Alabama and Mississippi, which
were ceded by her to the Federal Government. She was
among the ﬁrst States to accept and adopt the cause of
Independence and the issues of war, in 1861, and her soldiers
have ever been found in the front ranks of battle.

Georgia was settled in &733, under General Oglethorpe,
by colonists from England, Scotland, Switzerland, and Ger-
many, at Savannah.

FLORIDA was discovered in 1497, by Sebastian Cabot, then
sailing under the English ﬂag; visited by Ponce ,de Leon,
1512 ; visited by Allyon 1624 ; afterwards the seat of a French
Huguenot colony. It was afterwards settled "by Spaniards.
In 1763 it was ceded to Great Britain. 1

A colony of Greeks, Corsicans, &c., settled there, in 1769,
at New Smyrna. This State joined in the War of Indepen-
dence in 1861. ~ , ~

In_1725, Fort Alabama was located on the Alabama River,
by the French. In 1819 the STATE OF ALABAMA was admitted
to the Federal Union, and in 1860-61 it joined in the earliest
efforts made to bring about the independence of the South.

The ﬁrst Congress C. S. A. met at Montgomery, Alabama.

The States of MISSISSIPPI and LoUI_sIANA were settled by
the French. I

TEXAS was settled by people from Mexico, from the United
States, and almost all the European nations.

KENTUCKY, TENNESSEE, ARKANSAS, and MISSOURI, were
settled from the older States, chieﬂy from Virginia and Caro-
lina.

MARYLAND was an English colony, named after, Henrietta
Maria, queen of Charles I. of England. The ﬁrst settlement
was formed at St. Mary’s, in 1634.

RDELAWARE was settled, in 1627, by Swedes and Finns;
afterwards by Dutch and English.

In 1862 the Government of the Confederate States was duly
established at Richmond, Va., under a constitution which had
been adopted by the several States, with the inauguration

I SECTION XIX.‘-—The Procluctions of the Oonfeclemite States.

Although these States are capable‘ of producing nearly all
the varieties of grain, fruit, and other staples of the tempe-
rate zones, yet each district has its favourite product. The
term “staple ” is used to-designate the raw material, raised
and exported as the usual productof. any country,. as cotton,
tobacco, -&c. ~ x

TOBACCO is cultivated for export to foreign countries, in
considerable quantity,»in Maryland, Virginia, Carolina, Ken-
tucky, Tennessee, and Missouri.

- INDIAN CORN, WHEAT, RYE, OATS, BUCKWHEAT, and other
cereals, are grown in all the States; but corn and wheat are

the only grains raised for export, and these are produced-

chieﬂy by the tobacco-growing States. Virginia, Tennessee,
and Carolina, export large quantities of Indian corn. The
ﬂour made at the extensive mills at Richmond, Va., has long
been celebrated for its superior quality. There are extensive
ﬂour-mills on the Potomac River, above Harper’s Ferry, which
have produced very large quantities of good‘. ﬂour for-ex-

_ portation.

Apples, peaches, pears, apricots, ﬁgs, plums, g.rapes,.cur-
rants, strawberries, and other kinds‘ of fruit, are producedin
sufficient quantities, and of very ﬁne varieties, in the tobacco-
grovving"States, but only for’ home consumption.

These States also produce almost every varietyof forest
trees. The live oak grows to a large size in Florida, and
along some portions of the Mississippi valley; this valuable
Wood is used in ship-building. The pine ﬂourishes in Carolina,
where it affords an easy livelihood to numerous persons who
are engaged in making tar and turpentine: the various kinds
of oak, cedar, hickory, and chestnut are abundant in the tobacco
States, Where they are useful in building, fencing, (to. The
principal Woods exported are cypress‘. shingles and pine ﬂoor-
ing, from Carolina ; live Oak, 850. from Florida and the valley
of the Mississippi ; and White oak knees from Virginia.

PRODUCTIONSOF .THE.CONFEDERATE sTATEs. . .45

RICE is very extensively cultivated, for exportation, on the
low rich lands of the Carolinas, in Georgia, and in all the
cotton States. ' _ I ~

COTTON is the great staple of the Confederate States; and
is exported in large quantities from the Carolinas,‘Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas,
and Tennessee. The largest quantity of cotton is produced
by Alabama: Georgia ranks next in the quantity produced;
then Mississippi. The value of the cotton _orop of a single
year is more than $100,000,000.

SUGAR is very extensively cultivated in the cotton States;

0 the largest quantity is exported from Louisiana.

The Gulf States, together with Georgia and South Carolina,
have many tropical fruits in abundance for home consumption;
oranges, lemons, bananas, pine-apples, &c. ﬁnd there a genial
climate. Sweet potatoes are cultivated in all the States, but
excel in ﬂavour and size in Ca1'olina,-wliere they are grown for
export. Melons grow to a ‘large size, and are of the most
delicious ﬂavour, in every part of the country. Indigo is grown
in some parts of the Carolinas, and in the Gulf States.

Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas, and Missouri raise
large numbers of horses, sheep, cattle, and ‘hogs, for exporta-
tion: these States also export hides and wool,‘bacon and
beef. . ‘

Kentucky and Missouri cultivate considerable quantities of
ﬂax and hemp. ‘

Salt springs are very numerous, and afford inexhaustible
supplies of excellent salt ; they are worked to the _largest
extent along the valley of the Kanawha River, and in the
mountainous regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and North
Carolina. .

Rock Salt is found in Louisiana in purity and abundance.

GoLD is found in Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia.

IRON abounds in all the States ; but Missouri ranks among
the most favoured of all lands, in this and other mineral

_ products.

SECTION XX.—-The Flora of the C'0nfedemt_e States.

There is great variety and luxuriance of vegetation in this
region of country, which, in addition to the fruits and trees
already named, is proliﬁc in almost all the ﬂowers and plants
that are to be found on the American continent. Roses,
J essamines, Azalias, Tulips, Hyacinths, Lilies, Violets, Lilacs,
&c., adorn the gardens of every State; while the Magnolia
Grandiﬁora, the Palmetto, the American Poplar, the Holly,
the Cedar, and the Cotton-wood, combine with other vegeta-
tion to attract the attention of the stranger, as he passes
through the regions where they grow. The Holly-tree is the

‘beauty and glory of Virginia tide-water regions ; the Palmetto

and Magnolia are the pride of Carolina. The Cotton-wood
belongs to the- delta of the Mississippi. The Cactus plant is
indigenous to the whole country, but its larger and more
beautiful growth is in Texas, and on the Gulf. The Mistletoe
and other parasites (plants that live upon trees and other
plants) hang in luxuriant abundance upon the trees that
occupy the banks of streams or grow in moist soil.*
Blackberries, wild raspberries, strawberries, whortleberries,
&c., are found in proliﬁc abundance in every uncultivated
ﬁeld. Plants of pmedicinalvirtue exist in rich profusion and

great variety throughout every portion of the land.

In the Cotton States they need no conservatory to protect
their ﬂowers in winter ; but these are extensively used in
Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland. The private gardens and
parks of many citizens of these States are in the highest culti-

vation, and contain many foreign plants.

* Parasites are among the most wise and useful provisions of nature
to regulate the health and productiveness of low moist lands, as well as
the shady side of hills, &c. They fasten themselves upon trees, rocks,
decaying wood and other substances which; contain moisture, or exude

.miasma; and they feed upon this miasma, which comes to them dis-

solved in vapour, or is extracted from the decaying wood. The wood
a bsorbsit from the air, and the plant takes it from the wood. They
are thus the safeguard and health-preservers of warm moist climates.

SECTION XXI.-— The Sceizery of the Confederate States.

‘These States abound in every variety of scenery.
Tockoa Falls are in the State of Georgia, at Cunawhee Moun-

tain, where the creek ﬂows over a precipice 187 feet high ; the -

creek is usually but twenty feet wide, but when swelled by

rains, it presents a large body of water in an unbroken cascade,

and is very beautiful.

The Falls of the Towaliga, in the same State, are very pic-
turesque. The creek is 800 feet wide, and its descent _is
broken into falls and rapids, amid a wild and rough country.
One of these falls is ﬁfty feet. The Falls of the Tullulah, or
Terrora (which is anlndian Word for Terror), are in Habersham
County, Ga. The granite chasm through which the stream
rushes down, is one thousand feet high, and about the same
width. The cataract is about sixty feet.

“ Rock Mountain” with its tower, near the Chatahoochee
river, presents an almost precipitous cliff of one thousand feet
in height, whence the view is very extensive and beautiful.

In South Carolina there is a ﬁne waterfall called “ Chara-

ashilactay,” where the stream leaps from a mural precipice

that is somewhat remarkable in its character.

“ The Natural Bridge” is a celebrated arch of solid rock,
spanning a chasm, through which Cedar Creek flows, in Rock-
bridge County, Va. The bridge is less than 260 feet in
height, although it has been represented as 270 feet by some
travellers. It is regarded as one of the great natural
curiosities of the world. A stage road passes over its arch.
The scenery is wild and impressive.

The Mammoth Cave in Kentucky is also one of the great

50 A GEOGRAPHY FOR BEGINNERS.

natural curiosities of the world. It has been explored for
ﬁfteen miles, and is found to possess vasti chambers adorned
with immense pendent stalactites, and having unfathomable
depths of dark silent Waters, in which are sightless ﬁsh, and

vmany other remarkable things. Nitre or saltpetre is found

in this cave.

The most beautiful and variegated scenery is found along
the banks of the Tennessee River, Where it forces itsway
through the Cumberland‘ Hills; and the University of the
-South has been located amid this grand and impressive scenery,
upon the Sewanee Mountain, near Chattanooga, Gra. The
scenery of the Southern States affords ‘every Variety of land-
scape,‘ from the sublimity of the “Peaks of Otter,” to the
beauty of the prairie.

SECTION XXII.——-The Fauna of the C’077feclerate States.

In_ addition to the animals already mentioned, there are the
other Varieties peculiar to the zone. The Cat family, which
becomes lions and tigers in Africa and Asia, exists here as
the panther and cougar, the Wild cat, &c. ‘

The Dog family becomes the prairie wolf or Wild dog, and
the large Wolf, &c. The prairie dog is gregarious; and though
small in size, and timid -When confronted by man, is very

to the mountains and forests. Wild horses and buffaloes
range the vast and fertile plains of the West. Deer and other
wild game are abundant in the valley of the Mississippi. The
alligator ﬁnds his home amid the swamps and pools -of the
Gulf regions ; where, with the moccasin, the copper-head, and
other _venomous snakes, he basks in the sun, amid “the
Victoria regia ” and other ﬂowers, whose fragrance and beauty
are unsurpassed by the ﬂowers of royal gardens. .

There are many varieties of “ the Falcon family,” from the
‘noble eagle to the small but swift sparrowhawk; and they
subserve a wise and useful purpose in preying upon vermin
and reptiles, occasionally levying a tax upon the farmer’s
lambs, or chickens. These birds devour large quantities of
mice and rats, serpents, squirrels, &c., which would destroy
the farmer’s crops.

“ The vulture” of the East becomes “ the Turkey buzzard ”
of the Southern States, and is a valuable scavenger, whose
sight and smell are so wonderfully developed, that they can
discover the presence of a small piece of meat at the distance
of many miles.‘ The crow and the blackbird consume enor-
mous quantities of living as well as dead animals, and are
invaluable to the farmer.

The whip-poor-will, the martin, the swallow, &c. devour
incredible numbers of insects, which would otherwise render
human life almost impossible. The beetle follows in the track
of the larger animals, and carefully buries and consumes
their excrement, thus converting that which would become
oﬁensive and malarious into a means of cultivating and en-
riching the soil. Meanwhile, endless varieties of earthworms,

locusts, ants, &c., are constantly employed in tunnelling and
turning up the soil, that it may not only condense the miasma

and impurities of the air which thus gets access to it, but also
be enriched by the vexuviw‘ of animal and vegetable life, and
their own carcases, which they convey there.

existence depends on the power and patronage of the British
crown.

The seat- of Government is at London; the style of the
kingdom is “ The ' United Kingdom of Great Britain and‘
Ireland ;” the government is regulated by good and wholesome
laws and constitutions; these constitutions everywhere not only
recognize the supreme authority of the Almighty, but also the
Christian religion as the avowed faith of the people ; while, at
the same time, the members of all‘other creeds are not only
tolerated, but are protected in the peaceable enjoyment of their
worship. The common law of Great Britain is a model of
just and equitable legislation, embodied from the great prin-
ciples of the book of Leviticus, and adapted by the experience
of ageslto the conditions of modern society. The adminisw
tration of the government is committed to the Crown, the two
houses of Parliament, the lords lieutenant, governors and
legislative assemblies of Ireland, Scotland, and the various
Statesof which the empire is composed. The Crown derives:
its authority from the acknowledged Supreme Ruler of the

Nevis rises to the height of 4,406 feet. The “ lV_[acgillicuddi‘e‘
Beeks” mountain in Ireland, on the south-Western coast,
is 8,500 feet high.

These islands abound in beautiful lakes, and ﬁne scenery
adorned With old ruins of churches and castles of former days ;
which are the more interesting because they are associated with
those giant minds and noble hearts, Whose endurance,» for?‘
titude, and piety have made the Anglo-Saxon race what it is. ’

I The past of Great Britain belongs to us all, for it was the
Work of our forefathers.-

In size, the island is larger than Virginia ; in population, it
is more than double the Whole of the Confederate States: in
its internal improvements it surpasses all other lands, both by
the excellence of its- railways, canals, and public roads,- and
the method, safety, and rapidity of transportation.

Notwithstanding all the efforts of ambitious and discon-
tented men, Great Britain has succeeded in securing to the
citizens of Ireland, the same liberty and civil rights that her
own people enjoy. Ireland is represented in Parliament, and
every oﬂice and honour is open alike. to the people of both

. countries.

The soil and climate‘ of Ireland are good; the institutions
for education, &c., are of the best kind ; the people are gene-'
rous and brave; and the island promises to take a high rank
in the empire.

WALES.

Area in square miles, 7,200. Population, 1,112,000. Counties, 12.

The surface of Wales is mountainous and well watered ; and
the scenery is generally very picturesque.
The soil is less fertile and less cultivated than that of Eng-

land, but the climate is similar.

Barley and oats are the chief

grains raised. Iron, coal, and other minerals are abundant.

60 A; GEOGRAPHY ron BEGINNERS.

The inhabitants are chieﬂy of the Celtic race, descended
from the ancient Britons. 'Most of them still speak the Welsh
language. The mining industry of the country is highly im-
portant; but agriculture is in a backward state.

Manufactures are chieﬂy of woollen goods, which, with mineral

produce and cattle, form the leading exports.

BANGOR, situated on Menai Strait, is a noted bathing-place.
Its trade is small, consisting chieﬂy in the export of slates.

Menai Strait is about 14 miles in length, and from 200
yards to 2 miles in width. It is crossed by a suspension—
bridge, beneath which ships of the largest class can sail.

A short distance from this, the strait is crossed by a
tubular suspension-bridge, which consists of two iron tubes,
joined together, of more than a quarter of a mile each in
length, resting upon massive pillars of masonry, at an eleva-
tion of 100 feet above high water. Through this tube rail-
cars pass, as if it were a tunnel through solid rock on
land.

MERTHYR TYDVIL, the largest town in the principality, is
situated on the Taff. It is noted as being in the vicinity of
extensive coal and iron mines, and for its numerous iron
foundries.

The soil in some of the valleys, and on -the -east coast, is
fertile; but in the mountainous districts it is, for the most
part, barren. The climate is humid, and colder than that of
England. '

The staple crop of Scotland consists of cats. Wheat, and
other grains, are also cultivated ; and coal, iron, and lead are

abundant. In some parts, potatoes are extensively grown’ for
the supply of the London market. Sheep and cattle are
abundantly reared, and the ﬁsheries are extensive.

In the small island of Staffa, which lies a few miles west
of the Island of Mull, is the remarkable Cave of Fingal. It
is 227 feet long, from 20 to 50 feet broad, and from 60 to
nearly 100 feet in height.

The Falls of Clyde, in a’ river of the same name, con-
sisting of three distinct falls of 30, 84 and 80 feet each, are
much noted for their picturesque beauty.

The inhabitants form two distinct races; the Highlanders,
who are of the Celtic race, and who speak what is called the
Gaelic dialect; and the Lowlanders, who are a mixed people,
similar to the English. The leading pursuits are manufactures
and commerce; and the ﬁsheries constitute an important and
valuable branch of industry. ,

Excellent roads extend through almost every part of the
country, and canals and railroads are numerous. Two great
lines of railway enter Scotland from England——cne to Glasgow,
and the other to Edinburgh; from these cities, other lines pro-
ceed northward, as far as Aberdeen,-——between which place and
London there is an uninterrupted railway communication about

.550 miles in length.

One of the principal manufactures is that of cotton goods.
Linen is also manufactured to some extent; and there are
extensive iron-works. The exports are chieﬂy manufactured
goods. Agricultural produce is extensively supplied to Eng-
land, including large numbers of cattle.

EDINBURGH, the metropolis of Scotland, is built on a range

Dairy farms are numerous. Fruits do not ripen without
much care and attention. Peat is abundant, and is used by
the lower classes for fuel. The leading minerals are marble,
granite, iron, and copper. A

The Giant’s Causeway is situated on the northern coast of

‘Ireland, about seven miles NE. of Coleraine. Its length, from
the coast seaward, is about 700 feet; its breadth, 350 feet;
and its height varies from 1 foot to 80 feet.
A It is composed of about 40,000 polygonal pillars of dark-
coloured basalt. Each pillar, in itself a distinct piece of work-
manship, separable from all the adjacent columns, consists of
several pieces, the joints of which are articulated with the
utmost nicety. ' T

Ireland is mainly a grazing country, and great numbers of
cattle are reared, chieﬂy for exportation. A large majority of

the inhabitants are of the! Celtic race; ' About four-ﬁfths of the

population directly depend for subsistence and employment

‘upon the soil.

__ The roads are. generally good. The principal canals are the
Royal and Grand Canals, from Dublin to the Shannon; and
the canals from Lough Neagh to Belfast and Nevvry. There
are also railroads, connecting Dublin with Belfast, with Cork,
with Limerick, and with Galway ; and several others. _

The chief and most valuable manufacture is that of linen.
Considerable quantities of cotton goods are manufactured in
the vicinity of Belfast, and Irish poplin (a fabric of silk and
Worsted) is made in Dublin. These, withdairy and a variety
of agricultural produce (including vast numbers of live cattle

and pigs), form the leading articles of export.

a DUBLIN, the great metropolis of Ireland, situated ‘on both

-sides of the Liffey, his distinguished for the number and magni-

ﬁcence of its public buildings, and its numerous splendid resi-
dences, which entitle it to be regarded as one of the ﬁnest cities
of Europe.

Six miles to the eastward of the city, on Dublin Bay, is
Kingstown, the seaport for‘Dublin; the mailpacket station for
communication with Liverpool and Holyhead, and a favourite
place of resort for the Dublin citizens.

The traveller is conveyed from Dublin to Holyhead_, a
distance of '70 miles, by a swift steam-packet in about four
hours; thence by railway across the island of Anglesea, the

_Menai Strait, Wales, and England, to London, in nine hours-:

the whole distance between the two cities, amounting to 330

miles, being thus traversed in the short space of 18 hours.
BELFAST, situated at ‘the head of Belfast Lough, is noted for

its linen and cotton manufactures. It has considerable foreign

-trade, as well as extensive intercourse by steamers with the

chief Scotch and English seaports.

-WATERFORD, on the right bank of the Suir, is noted for its
fine quay and harbour, and as being the great entrepot for a
large extent of country.

CORK, thersecond city in Ireland in size and population, is
situated on the Lee, about 12 miles above Cork Harbour. It
is the chief emporium of the south of Ireland, and is exten-
sively engaged in the provision trade. /

sheep, but offer no shelter or sustenance for man; and a
great but unascertained number are skerries or rocks,-‘—mere
sea-washed and naked stone.

The climate of . the isles is Very Variable and humid. The
long winter nights are often ‘cheered by the aurora borealis;
and in May, une, and July, night is scarcelyknown. ,

The. number of inhabited islands is 29: of small islands,
called holms, 38 ; and the number of slcerries, or rock islets, has
not been accurately ascertained. The climate does not partake,
in any great degree, either of summer’s heat or winter’s cold.
During about a month at midsummer, the light, owing

partly to the highness of the latitude, and partly to the superior

reﬂecting power of water over the land, is so strong, at mid-

night, that, when -the sky is clear, persons may see to read,

principal groups, called the Inner .and the Outer Hebrides.

The total number,‘ not including the small islets, amounts to

PREFACE

EDUCATION consists not merely in the acquisition of
knowledge, but also, and chieﬂy, in learning to observe

accurately and systematically.

It is the design of this book, and the series of books
of which it forms a part, to aid the Teacher in educating

his Pupil, as well as to impart useful knowledge.

And, inasmuch as all valuable attainments must be
the result of labour, and therefore, the Scholar must
master certain things in order to attain a knowledge of
Geography, these are given in the concise form of a
Dictionary, which should be memorized before the Pupil

advances further.

In the present volume, systematic arrangement is
preserved as far as practicable; but, inasmuch as it
is merely an introduction to the other volumes, a perfect

method in its details cannot always be accomplished.

race, and are divided into three principal families, viz. :—’-the
Teutonic, or German, chieﬂy inhabiting the northern and
central parts of the continent; the Sclavonians, the eastern
portions ; and the Celtic, some small parts in the West.

The south of Europe is mainly occupied by a mixed race,
resulting from the intermarriage of these three great families.
The remnant of the population is made up of the Mongolian
race : these are the Finns and Laplanders—the Samoiedes and
Kalmucks (the former in the northern and the latter in the
south-eastern part of Russia)—the Turks; and the Magyars,
who form the majority of the population of Hungary.

The first inhabitants of Europe came from Asia, the cradle
of the human race; and it is probable that the south-east
corner of the continent, or Greece, was the region earliest
peopled in Europe. '

Next to Great Britain, France is the most powerful and
important of the great empires of the World. Indeed, there a_re

several things in which France ranks above all other nations. '

The present illustrious Emperor has done much to develop
and establish the present position of his empire in the face of
much opposition. , His people are justly proud of their ruler
as a brave general, a humane and Wise governor, and a saga-
cious statesman, Who, Without interfering with the religious
and spiritual jurisdiction of the Papal court, and the Moham-
medan divan, has gradually emancipated the people who Were
under their political thraldom. This could not have been done
without the consent and aid of Great Britain, and the Will of
the King of kings; but it has been Wisely effected; and,

FRANCE. 7 1

after more than twelve centuries‘ of almost unlimited‘ political
power over surrounding nations, the Papal and Mohammedan
dynasties ﬁnd themselves divested of theauthority to persecute

the Jew or the Christian, save only by appealing to the pas- .
‘sions of mobs. France differs, however, from Great Britain

in'tl1e,permcmence of her power and political institutions; for,
in the one case, they rest on a permanent national Consti-
tution ; in the other, they depend on the energies and wisdom
of the Executive.

Paris is the first city of the world in some respects, and
second only to London in others.

The manufactures of France embrace almost everything
that the nations trade in, and in some articles they surpass
other countries in the cheapness and quality of products.
Wine and. spirituous liquors, silks, cloth, watches and jewel-
lery, gloves, the finer varieties of cotton and woollenirgoods,
perfumes, chemicals, and the superior kinds of chinaware, are
among some of the manufactures in which the French excel.

They have a large country, a ﬁne climate, and a location
which makes them the natural political centre of Europe.

The name of the present emperor is Louis Napoleon; his
empress is Eugenie-Marie de Guzman, Comtesse de Téba.
His reign began in the year 1852, Dec.’2nd.

The surface of France is mountainous in the south-eastern’

and southern portions, and level, or undulating, in the north
and north-west.

Grain is generally grown on the higher grounds; but maize
is everywhere general. Madder, from which a dye is obtained,
is cultivated in some districts. Among vegetables, the beet-
root, from which sugar is obtained, is extensively raised. Silk,
wool, wines, olive-oil, and a great variety of fruits, are among
the most important products. 7

The forests furnish excellent timber for ship-building and
carpentering. Bees and the silk-worm-are extensively reared
in the --southof France. The -chief minerals jareiron, coal, and
salt.

'72 A GEOGRAPHY ron BEGINNERS.

France is mainly inhabited by a mixed race, in which the
Celtic predominates. In the parts bordering on the Rhine, the
people are mostly of the Germanic race. More than one—half
the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits, of which
the cultivation of the vine forms an important feature.

The high—roads are numerous and good. The principal
lines of railways connect Paris with the most important towns
on the English Channel and with those on the Belgian frontier.

[There are also railroads which connect some of the cities in

the interior with the capital.

The navigable rivers and canals afford facilities of communi-
cation for a distance of about 8,000 miles. By means of rail-
roads and steam-navigation, the journey between Paris and
London (a. distance of 215 miles) is eﬁ"ected in ten hours.

PARIS, the capital, extends for about 5 miles along the river
Seine:.,(1l1 milesfrom its mouth), which is here crossed by

-upwards of twenty bridges. The city is surrounded by walls,

entered by gates or bcmriéres. Thehpublic structures of the city
are numerous and magnificent. Of the religious ediﬁces,
the Cathedral of Notre Dame is the most celebrated. It is

situated on one of the islands in the Seine, called “Ile

de la Cité.”
The Champs Elysées, a favourite place of resort, is a sort

-of public promenade or park lined with trees. The public

fétes all take place here; and even on ordinary occasions,
various attractions, such as shows, panoramas,__circuses, music,
850., are to be met with here. Paris is noted for its National-
Library, containing large and valuable collections of books and
manuscripts.

It is the, secolld city in Europe in population, and in reference
to its scientiﬁc, literary, and educational establishments, it
surpasses other cities. Twelve miles west of Paris, is Ver-
sailles, noted for its magniﬁcent palace.

LE HAVRE is an important commercial city of France. It
communicates regularly by steam-packets with New York, and
also with various points of Europe.

FRANCE. .73

CALAIS, a fortiﬁed seaport town, owes its importance chieﬂy
to its being the French port nearest to England.

STRASBURG, or Strasbourg, a strongly fortiﬁed city, carries
on an extensive transit trade. Steamers ply between this city
and Basle, Rotterdam, and London. It is celebrated for its
cathedral.

Lvoivs is the second city in France in commercial_importance,
and the chief seat of the manufactures of silks, velvets, &c.

MARSEILLES is extensively engaged in the trade of wines and
fruits ; and is the great outlet for all the natural and artiﬁcial
productions of Southern France.

NANTES carries on considerable trade with Northern Ger-

many, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia. The vessels come

freighted with hemp, tallow, &c., and carry back the wines and
brandies of France. .

BORDEAUX is the great emporium of the wine trade, and the
chief commercial port on the Bay of Biscay.

Paris, Rouen, Dieppe, Lille, Valenciennes, Amiens, Rheims,
Metz, Strasburg, Lyons, Grenoble, Avignon, Marseilles, Nismes,
Bordeaux, and Nantes, are noted manufacturing places.

The chief naval stations and dockyards of France are at
Cherbourg, Toulon, L’Orient, and Brest. The principal ports
for foreign trade are St. Malo, Le Havre, Dieppe, Boulogne,
Marseilles, Bayonne, Bordeaux, La Rochelle, Nantes, and
L’Orient.

 

The colonial possessions of France are——the Territory of
Algeria, in Northern Africa; the Island of Bourbon, in the
Indian Ocean; St. Louis, at the mouth of the Senegal, in
Western Africa ; the small Islands of St. Pierre and Miqfielon,
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the Islands of St. Martin (north
part), Guadaloupe, Martinique, Desirade, Mariegalante and
Les Saintes, in the West Indies; a part of Guiana, in South
America ; Pondicherry, anda few other settlements, in Hinde-
stan ; the Marquesas Isles and the Island of Tahiti, in Poly-

~ nesia ; and New Caledonia, in Australasia. I

SECTION XXVII.-—--Norway and Sweclm.

NORWAY.
Area in square miles, 122,460. Population. 1,328,000. Provinces, 5.

The surface is mountainous, abouncling in romantic scenery;
and the coast is deeply indented by numerous fiorcls, or salt-
water inlets. The mountains of Norway do not form ,a con-
tinuous chain or ridge, as usually represented, but, especially
in the south, a series of broad plateaux, separated occasionally
by deep and narrow Valleys. ' ‘

The soil is generally poor; in some places it is so shallow
as not to admit of being ploughed. The winters are long and
coldfand the summers warm, but of short duration. In this
country, as well as in various other places in high latitudes,
Vegetation is extremely rapid on the return of summer. In
many districts, barley is reaped in six or seven weeks after the
seed has been sown.

Rye, barley, oats, and potatoes are the chief agricultural
products. ,Fruit-trees are not common in Norway. Therivers,

seas, and lakes of the entire peninsula swarm with the greatest
abundance of ﬁsh. The Norwegian horses, a small but hardy
breed, are extensively exported to Sweden and Great Britain.
The principal sources of wealth are the mines, forests, and
ﬁsheries. ,

The Norwegians are of Germano-Celtic origin. Their
leading pursuits are raising cattle, mining, and ﬁshing. Lap-
landers and Finns inhabit the northern part of the country.

There are no railroads or canals, and no public coaches in
the kingdom: to facilitate_communication, stations have been
established at distances of from 7 to 10 miles. At each
station the neighbouring farmers are obliged to furnish horses
and a driver to carry the traveller to the next station. The
remuneration they are .entitled to receive is ﬁxed by the
Government. S

Few of the rivers are navigable for any distance inland.
The Grlommen, the longest river in the kingdom, is navigable
for ships only the distance of 14 miles from its mouth.

Manufactures are few, and chieﬂy limited to useful articles
for domestic life and agricultural purposes. The leading
exports are iron, copper, ﬁsh, timber, cod-liver oil, turpentine,
and horses.

CHRISTIANIA, the capital, is the chief seat of foreign trade.
The bay is dotted with numerous wooded islands, which.
present a beautiful appearance when viewed from the city.

Drammen is noted for its trade in timber. ,

Bergen derives its chief importance from being the entrepot
of the ﬁsheries of the country.

SWEDEN.
Area in square miles, 170,500. Population, 3,300,000. Laens, or provinces, 24.

The surface of Sweden is mostly level, abounding in lakes
and small rivers. Nearly one-eighth of the surface ispcovered
with lakes, and one-fourth with forests, consisting chieﬂy of
beech, oak, ﬁr, pine, and birch.

The soi-1 is not generally good, and only a -small ‘part of

either this country or Norway is under cultivation. The winter
throughout the greater part of the entire peninsula occupies
about seven months of v the year, during which the ground is
covered with snow, and the surface of the lakes and rivers
forms a ﬁrm coating of ice. Upon the frozen surface thus
everywhere presented, the inhabitants travel with facility in
sledges drawn by horses or by reindeer.

The products resemble those of Norway, except that in this
part of the peninsula a surplus of corn is raised; while, in
Norway, there is not enough for home consumption.

There are several interesting cataracts in various parts of
the Scandinavian Peninsula; the most noted of which are the
Falls of Trolhoetta, which occur in the River Gotha, about
50 miles distant from Grottenburg. It is the greatest fall in
Europe of the same volume of water.

The inhabitants are styled Swedes, and are of the same
origin as the Norwegians. The people of Sweden and Norway
speak different dialects of the same language. The leading
industrial pursuits are rearing of live-stock, mining, and com-
merce.

The main roads to and from Stockholm are generally excel-
lent. The most important canals are those of Grotha and
Trolhoetta ; the former connecting Lakes Wener and Wetter,
and the latter overcoming the obstructions in the navigation of
the outlet of Lake Wener.

By means of these canals a navigable water communication
is maintained from the Baltic Sea to the Strait of Cattegat,
across the southern part of Sweden. Steamboats ply on all
the principal lakes, and on such parts of the rivers as are
navigable.

The exports are mainly timber, grains, and the produce of
the mines. Lobsters are exported to the English market in
large numbers.

STooKHoLM, the capital of Norway and Sweden, is built on
some small islands at the entrance of Lake Malar. These
islands are united by several bridges, Its situation is ,ex~

tremely picturesque, and it is the chief commercial emporium
of Sweden.

Falun, or Fahlun, is a small town, noted for the extensive
copper mines in its vicinity.

Oarlscrona, situated on some small islands of the south
coast, is the naval arsenal of Sweden. The principal part of
the town communicates with the mainland by a bridge.

Malmo is one of the strongest towns in the kingdom, and
carries on considerable commerce.

Gottenburg is, next to the capital, the most important
trading city in the kingdom.

  SECTION XXVIII.——Russ2'a.

Area in square miles about 8,000,000. Population, 70,000,000. Governments, 58-.

The length of Russia, from the south part of the Crimea to
the shores of the Arctic Ocean, is about 1,700 miles. It com-
prises 58 governments, including the Province of Finland, and

-the portion of the former Kingdom of Poland which still‘

preserves-the name of that country.

It is chieﬂy a plain, divided into three parts—a northern,
a western, and a southern region—indicated by the respective
courses of the rivers toward the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea,
and the Black and Caspian Seas ; but the slopes of these are
very gradual. I '

The soil is marshy and poor in the north ; but in the south
it is tolerably fertile. In the northern part of the empire,‘
there may be said to be only two seasons_———summer and winter ;
the termination of the heat of summer being immediately fol-
lowed by the frost and snow of winter. In the south, it is
mild and temperate.
