BE KIND

Be kind yyyto thy FATHER, for when thou wert young, Be kind to thy Momma, for lo! on her brow
Who; so fondlyas be? May traces of sorrow be seen ;

He“cat2ght;the‘ﬁ-"»,'”.i§$:oents that fell from thy tongue, 0 well may’st thou cherish and comfort her now,
And joined in  glee. For loving and kind hath she been.

Be kind to thy BROTHER,---his heart will have dearth,
If the smile of thy love be withdrawn ;
The ﬂowers of feeling will fade at their birth,
If the dew --F affectizn be gone.

Be kind to thy SIs'.r1m,—--not many may know
The depth of true sisterly love;

The Wealth of the ocean lies fathoms below
The surface that spargzles above.

.2

Be kind to thy TEACHER,--the burden she hears,
Her spirits is Wearing away;

No price for her labor so precious appears,
As the kindness she meets day by day.

6
Be kind to thy SCHOOLMATES,--not long canstltlthou be
With schoolmates to study or play ;
Thy kindness will make thee more happy and free
When school pleasures vanish awav.

But 0, my heart turned every lay

Yet sad to me its joyous swell ;
And though its chime made others gay,

Though chill the winds and bare the bowers,
Yet this is home-—and that sad lay
I sing no more of “ far away.”

When the storms of winter blow?
What is it attracts them so?

’Tis our pleasant school.
Where do children love to be,
When the summer birds We see,
Warbling praise on every tree?

In our pleasant school.

When the beauteous morning breaks,
And each eye from slumber wakes,
What so happy children makes,

As our pleasant school?
Faithful may we keep the day!
Never waste the time in play I
Truthful all We do or say,

At our pleasant school.

Nor need be doubtful long; Or strike an angry blow ;

I  I should not steal, or use . But any kindness they may need

May our hearts gain wisdom, too; Lets no danger hover near;
Each his neigbbor’s joy enhancing, He it is who has befriended,
We will friendly be and true. Guided all our footsteps here.

1. Oh! come, come away from school and all its studies,
To fresher air awhile repair,--
Oh! come, come away.
We’ve sung and read, and lessons said,
And studied we11,‘our Words to spell,-
So now, since all is o’er, oh I come, come away

2. We’ve tried hard to be obedient to our teacher,
For how can she love you or me,
If we don’t obey?

She’s kind to all, both large and small,
And would feel sad, if we were bad ;

So if we’d gain her love, we all must obey.

3. Oh! come, come away,—-(Good night to thee, dear teacher !)

We’ll jump and run, we’ll have ﬁne fun,-—
Come, jump! jump again!

Yet, when to-morrow’s cheerful bell
Shall ring, the hour of school to tell,

Oh! then, with gladsome hearts, we’ll come, come again.

To my ear is borne in the stilly night.

3. And the ships that glide on the ocean wide,
Will I view from afar, through the foamy tide ;
To my cottage fair, will I welcome there,

All the friends I love——-by the pleasant sea-side.

4.? Oh! how sweet shall be that home by the sea,
Where the water’s wild play is boldand free!
Where the cliff is high, by the ocean nigh,
And the waves break sparkling incessantly.

HAPPY DAYS
AIR,—“ Greenville.”
1

Happy days are gliding o’er us,
Life is fresh, and earth is fair;
Sorrow swiftly ﬂies before us,
And we gaily laugh at care.
From our quiet slumber springing,
Cheerfully we pass the day,
Each succeeding moment bringing
Pleasant study work, or play.

ARE GLIDING 0’ER US. 39

2

Sometimes angry passions, rising,
Drive away our peace of mind ,-

O, ’tis strange, ’tis quite surprising,
That we are not always kind!

If we cherish good affections
And our parent’s will obey;

If we follow the directions
Of our teachers through the day;—-

If our spirit, meekness learning,
Unto God its homage gives ;
Like the modest violet, turning
To the sky its azure leaves ;-—
Then we never need be fearful,
As the gentle lamb or dove,
We are happy, we are cheerful,
When our hearts are full of love.

42 IF A BODY FIND A LESSON.
Am,--“ Comin’ thro’ the Rye.” ” '   Words by J. W. GREENE.

 

1. If a ho - dy ﬁnd a. les - son Kath — er hard and dry,—-

 

If no bo - dy comes _to “show” him, -Need  bo - dy cry?

 

If he’s lit - tle time to stud - y, Shquld he stop and sigh?

  

ﬁna-na...—a

 he says, “I V can- not get it,”—-- Ought he not to 1. av ?”

 

1

If a body ﬁnd a lesson
Rather hard and dry,—

If nobody comes to “ show ” him,
Need a body cry?

If he’s little time to study,
Should he stop and sigh?

Ere he says, “ I cannot get it,”-—
Ought he not to TRY?

43

If a body scan his lesson
With a steady eye,

All its hardness he will conquer,-—
Conquer by-and-by.

Then how neatly he’ll recite it,
Face not all a-wry !

Ne’er again he’ll say, “ I cannot .” ’
But will go and TRY.

FORGIVENESS

Am,--“ Bonny Doon.”

In peace with all the world we’ll live,
Nor let our angry passions burn;
But when we suffer, We’ll forgive,
And good for evil we’l1 return,-—
And We’ll forgive, and We’ll forget,
And conquer every sullen word;
Unkindness shall with love be met,
And evil overcome with good.

2
It is not pride, it is not strife,
Nor bitter thoughts, nor angry deeds
Which gild with joy the days of life;
Resentment still to sorrow leads; d
Then love shall triumph! love alone
Within our hearts shall ever reign;
Our foes subdued, its power shall own
And once-loved friends be friends "

44 I HAVE NO MOTHER

  
  

 

1. I have no moth- er, for she died, {When I was ve - ry youhg;
2. They tell me of an an - gel form That watched a. - round my bed;

9

      

But mem’ -ry still a - round my heart, Like morn - ing mist has hung.
And of a soft and qui - et hand That wiped the tears I shed.

3. With smiles she held my tiny arm, 5. And then she used to kneel with me,
When I began to walk ; And teach me how to pray ;
And joy would sparkle in her eyes, And raise my little hands to heaven,
When I would try to talk. And tell me what to say.

4 And often, too, as I was ill, 6. Oh ! mother, mother! in my heart
She  burning brow ; Thy image still shall be ;
Her tears would fall upon my cheek, And may I hope in heaven, at last,
I think I feel them now. To meet and live with thee.

DELAY NOT, DELAY NOT. 45
AIR,-“ Sweet Afton.”   ., _ Words by Miss L. L. A. VERY.

Delay not, delay not! oh, scholar, draw near,-
The school-bell is ringing most loudly for thee ;
Haste, haste I with thy mates in the school-room appear,
Thy teacher is waiting thy bright face to see.
2

Hark ! hark ! to the birds on each light bending spray,
They pour forth their carols in sweet tuneful glee ;

They bid you seek knowledge ere youth ﬂies away,
For like the bright rainbow, soon, soon it will ﬂee !

3
The ﬂow’rs on the road-side are smiling and bright,

’ They rose with the sun, washed their faces in dew ;
They send forth their perfume from morning till night,
To imitate them they are calling to you.

Delay not, delay not! oh, scholar, draw near,-—
The school-bell is ringing most loudly for thee ;

Haste, haste 1 with thy mates in the school-room appear,
Thy teacher is waiting thy bright face to see.

Now Vacation’s o’er ;

And. oh ! What pleasure ’tis to see

Here we sang our pretty songs,
And here we said “ Good-bye 1”

Gay sports and frolics we have seen,
Yet now to school we-hie.

School again, school again,

And oh 2 what pleasure ’tis to see

Words by Mrs. A. E. Shepard.
2 Pleasant scenes, pleasant scenes,
Met our happy gaze;
But oh! we’ve sweeter moments known,
In school’s familiar plays.
Here with knowledge we are blest,
Here truth and virtue shine ;
And cheerful faces we behold,
And wreaths of friendship twine.
School again, school again,
Now Vacation’s o’er;
And oh ! what pleasure ’tis to see
The old school-house once more!

SABBATH SCHOOL.

Children who go to Sabbath School,
Should ever mind this simple rule ;

It always opens iust at nine.

Words by a Teacher.

The opening hour  is set
At lzalflpast 0-vie, the winter through,
And in the summer, just at two.

PREFACE.

The leading characteristics of the present work are,—— 1. That the Airs are almost exclusively
popular;  That the Words are, with few exceptions, original, and composed expressly for schools.

In selecting the Popular Airs, a rigid regard has been paid to these two principles :~ -1. To
adopt such only as are specially pleasing, and likely to be sung well, even in schools where the
teacher is “no singer.” 2. To reject all such as have become stamped with a species of bad
notoriety from having been associated with coarse, or impure words. g

Several principles have been cautiously regarded in preparing the Words of this entire work:
Such topics have been chosen, generally, as have some important relation to the government of the
school ;--—the majority of the pieces are exclusively school pieces, while a few have been introduced
of a. general application ;-most of the Words (as well as Airs) are designed to cheer and enliven
the school, but these are interspersed with several of a sacred, or of a sentimental character ;—-a
few are to be accompanied by motions of the hands and arms, and these motions will be found at
once graceful, amusing, conducive to physical health, and not wanting in dignity ;—-and the most
scrupulous attention has been paid to every line of the poetry in regard to its MORAL INFLUENCE--—
the proof sheets having been submitted to the critical examination of persons of eminent ability
and moral sensitiveness. '

The work is respectfully submitted to the appreciation of those for whose use it is intended.

«I. W. GREENE.
Boston, May, 1852.

FINISHING CHORUS.

Now.-The Working Chorus and Finishing Chorus are exactly the same here, as for the “ Gentlemen Workers.”
For the 1st verse, the dress makers sew; the milliners arrange ribbons; the knitters km! ; and the s inners sqlurl the
s inning wheel with the right hand. For the 2d verse, the weavers throng the shuttle from right to le ; the dairy folks
c urn; the braiders braid; and the shop-kee ers measure with a yard-stick. _For the 3d vers_e_, there seem to be no
available motions of imitation. Let the Wor ing Chorus therefore be a Clappmg Chorus for tliht verse. Let the claps
be gentle, reg-uiar, and, on the humming part of the chorus, pretty fast. [See Directions on cover.]

1
Let me go to my school, I would not stay away Let me go to the place Where my lessons are said,
From my teacher and playmates, no, not for one day; Where numbers are counted, and good books are read,
Though the rain-drops may fall, and the cold breezes blow, Where ﬁne boys and girls stand so straight in a row,--
To the skchool-house I love let me go, let me go, , To the school-house I love let me go, let me go,
To the school-house I love, let me go, let me go. 3 To the school-house I love let me go, let me go.

Let me go where I'm taught to be truthful and kind,
To speak no bad language, no bad ways to mind,
Where the heart and the head may in harmony grow;
To the school-house I love let me go, let me go,
To the school-house I love let me go, let me go.
