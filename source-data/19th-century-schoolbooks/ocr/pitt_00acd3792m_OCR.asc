sentence, and the number of inferior pauses it contains.
The time of the final pause therefore does not admit of
any deﬁnite rule; but should always be such as to afford
relief to the voice, and enable the reader to commence
the ensuing sentence without undue or painful effort.

The principal pause beingthus attended to, we come
next to consider the various subordinate pauses.

Rune 11. When tlte subject in a serttence consists of
more than one word, it is necessary to pause after it.

When a nominative and a verb come in a sentence
unattended by adjuncts, no pause is necessary, either
for the ear or understanding ; thus in the following sen-
tettcew-wllenrartcler wept : o pause intervenes between
these words, because they convey only two ideas, which
are appreltendecl the moment they are pronounced; but
if these words are amplified by dependent words, as in
the following sentcnce——--T/te great and ineirtcible .:Ile.x:-
ander, tce}2t jbr the fate of Darius : Here a pause is
necessary between these words, not only that the organs
may pronounce the whole with more case, but that the
complex nominative and verb may, by being separately
and distinctly exhibited, be more readily and distinctly
cottccivecl.

EXAMPLES.

Sincerit): and truth form the basis of every virtue.

The appearances of security are frequently deceitful.

This rifle is so far from being unnecessary when we
are obliged to pause alter the verb, that it then becomes
more essential.

If in this sentence we only pause at will, as marked
by the printer, we shall find the verb swallowed up, as
it were, by the nominative case, and confounded with
it; but if we make a short pause both before and after
it, we shall ﬁnd every part of the sentence obvious and
distinct.

Moses. 7

  That the nominative is more s_eparable'from the verb
than the verb from the objective case, is; plain from the
propriety of pausing at setf-love, and not at forsook, in
the following example :

Self-love forsook the path it ﬁrst pursued,
And found the private in_the public good.
Pope’s Essay on Man.
The same may be observed of the last line of the fol-
lowing couplet :.
Earth smiles around with boundless bounty blest,
And heaven heholds its ‘image in his breast. Ib-id.

Here though‘ the «melody invites to a pause at beholds,
propriety requires it at heaven. ‘

RULE lll. Whatever member intervenes between the
nominative case and the verb, is of the nature of a paren-
thesis, and must be separated from both of them bya
short pause. e

EXAMPLE.

When the Romans and the Sabines wereat War, and just upon
‘the pointof giving battle, the women, who were all.ed to both of
them, interposed with so many tears and entreaties, that they pre-

‘vented the mutual slaughter which threatened both parties, and

-united them together in a ﬁrm and lasting peace. ﬂddison-.

Here the member intervening between the nomina-
tive ‘éase women, and the verb interposed, must be sep-
arated from both by a short pause.

RULE IV. Whatever member intervenes between the
verb and the objective case, is of the nature of a pa-
renthesis, and must be separated from both by a short
pause.

EXAMPLE.

I knew a person who possessed the faculty of distinguishing ﬂavors
in so great a perfection, that, after having tasted ten different kinds
of tea, he would distinguish, without seeing the colour of it, the par-
ticular sort which was offered him. ﬂddison.

The member intervening between the verb distin-
guish and the acousative the particular sort, must be
separated from them by a short pause.

RULE XI. Two nouns in apposition, provided either
be accompanied by dependent words, must be separated

by a pause.

EXAMPLES.

‘RULE XIV. Prepositions and conjunctions are more
united withthe words they precede than with those they
follow; and consequently,  it be necessary to pause,
the preposition andwnjunction oughtto be classed with
the succeeding words, and not with the preceding.

EXAMPLES.
I will not let thee go, except, thou bless_m.e..

Here the conjunction eaqcept, naturally associates itself
with the latter part of the sentence, and requires a short
pause before it.

This let him know,

Surprisal. Milton.
ln this example, the conjunction lest is very properly
separated from the precedingwords by a short pause at

ing come between the conjunction, and the pronoun to
which it belongs, the conjunction has very properly a
pause both before and after it.

In this sentence the preposition up is separated from

INFLECTIONS on THE VOICE. 13

EXAMPLES.
Innocence confers ‘tranquillity on the mind, and leaves it open to
every pleasing sensation.
Sometimes the two parts commence with corres-
ponding conjunctions, as in the following sentence,

' As we cannot discern the shadow moving’ along the dial-plate,_so
the advances we‘ make in knowledge are only perceivable by the
distance gone over. » ’ V
A sentence of this sort, where the ﬁrst part depends on
-the latter for sense, IS called a DirectPeriod.

Sometimes the latter conjunction is understood.

EXAMPLE.

As in my speculations I have endeavoured,to extinguish passion
and prejudice, I am still desirous of doing some good in this par-
ticular.

Here the word so, answering to as, is implied by the
sense, and the pauseof course falls at the comma.

Where the first part forms sense, but is modiﬁed by
the last, it is called an Inverted Period.

EXAMPLE.

Many things are believed, though they exceed the capacity of our
Wits.

 Where the ﬁrst part is independent of the second,

they constitute a Loose Sentence.

EXAMPLE.

Persons of good taste expect to be pleased, at the same time they
are informed ; and think that the best sense always deserves the best
language. ’

INFLECTIONS OF i THE VOICE.

Besides the pauses which indicate a greater or less
separation of the parts of a sentence and its conclusion,
there are certain inﬂexions of voice accaotrapanying these
gpauses, which are equally necessary to the sense; these

2

are called the rising and the falling lnflection. They
may be illustrated by the following Example.

Ctesar does not deserve (ante, hut blame.

Here, in the most natural and obvious mode of reading
the sentence, the rising inflection accompanies the pause
atfame, and the falling occurs at blame: and we find all
sentences cnnstructed in the same manner have, like
this, the rising inflection on the negative, and the falling
on the aﬂirtnative member.

The distinction of the inflections is still better shewn

by placing the same word in opposition to itself.
Does he say fame, or fame?
He does not any fame, but fame.

Every reader, in pronouncing the above phrases, will
ive the first fame the rising, and the last the falling in-
ettion.

The rising inflection is marked with the acute ac-

cent  the falling with the grave accent

The variations of tone, which these pessn%es require,
are more minutely shewn in the following p etc, where
the rising and falling inflections are denoted by a cor-
responding direction of the words.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLQTE.

The sentence, No. I. and any other sentence con-
structed in exactly the same manner, must necessarily
atlnpt the rising inﬂectinn on the first member, and the
fellin on the last; that is, the rising inﬂectinn en vol-
tintartly, and the falling on :'~nnolunutriIy; and this pro-
nunciation is so appropriated to this species of sentence,
that the dnllest and most nnprectised car would, with-
out the least reflection, adopt it. The same may be

said of the sentence, No.11. which every ear would
agree in pronouncing with the same inflections in a
contrary order; that is, the falling inflection on eolun-»
tnrily, and the rising on involuntarily.

No. H1. and IV. shew, that the some words take dif-
ferent inflections in correspondence with the sense and
structure of the sentence ; for as the word constitution,
in No. IV. only ends a member of the sentence, and
leaves the sense unﬁnished, it necessarily adopts the
suspending or rising inﬂection; and harmony reqnires
that the preceding words should be an arranged, as to
form the greatest harmony and variety, which is done
by giving every one of the words an inflection, different
from what it has in No. Ill. where constitution ends the
sentence.

The inflections being thus explained, we next pro-
ceed to the rules for their application.

COMPACT SENTENCE.

its we cannot discern the shadow moving along the dial-plate, so

at drial-plate; as the second is compounded, it is mark»
ed with a semicolon at moving; and as the last is corn,-
pounded, it is marked with a colon ‘at grow; for it is"
certainly proper that the time of the pause should in-
crease with the increase and complexity of the,mem-

hers to which it is annexed, as more time is required

to comprehend a large and complicated memberythian-a
short and simple one : but whatever may be the time
taken up in pausing at thediﬂerent points, the inflec-

tion annexed to them must always be the same ; that

is, the comma, semicolon, and colon,,must invariably

have the rising inflection.

The same may be observed of the following sen-
tences:

These sentences begin with the concessive conjunction
although, and have their correspondent conjunction yet ,-

structive members. The words him and examples,

the rising inflection, and here must be the long pause.

If impudence prevailed as much in the forum and courts of

tus ZF.butius in this cause, as he did -before to his insolence when
assaulted by him.

The same insertion of the word then might be made
in the two last examples commencing. with  and the
same suitableness would appear; for though correct and
animated language tends to suppress as much as possible
the words that are so implied in the sense as to make it
unnecessary to express them, yet if, when inserted,
they are suitable to the sense, it is a proof that the
structureof the sentence is perfectly the same,«Whether
these superﬂuous words are expressed or not.

Exception. The exception to this rule is, when
the emphatical word inthe conditional part of the sen-
tence is in direct opposition to another word in the con-

clusion, and a concession is implied in the former, in

order to strengthen the argument in the latter; for in
this case the middle of the sentence has the falling, and
the latter member the rising inﬂection.

If we have no regard for religion in ybuth, we ought to have some
regard for it in age.

In these examples, we ﬁnd the words youth, and own

Lfrratian very often recommends the ﬁne taste, as the utmost per“-

Aristotle tells us, that the world is a copy or transcript of those
ideas which are in the mind of the ﬁrst Being, and that those ‘ideas

Words. Spect. No. 166.

In this example, if there were no connexion between
the two last members from the antithesis they contain,
the rising inﬂection would be necessary at the end of
the penultimate member, for the sake of sound.

In short, a modern Pindaric writer, compared with Pindar, is like
a sister among the Camisars, compared with Virgil’s» Sybil ; there is

In the ﬁrst of theseiexamples the sentence might
have ﬁnished at itself; and in the last at life, for the
succeeding members do not modify them; but, as they
are penultimate members, they necessarily require the
rising inﬂecttion.

Exception. Emphasis, which controls every other
rule in reading, forms an exception to this; whit-.11 is,
that where an emphatic word is in the first member
of a sentence, and the last has no emphatical word, this
penultimate member then terminates whit the falling in-
ﬂecﬁon.

EXAMPLES.

I must therefore desire the reader to remember, that by the plenar-
ures of the imagination, I mean cmly such pttaasums as arise 0rigin—

In this sentence the word sight is emphatical, and
therefore, thcmgh in the penultixmtte member, must not
have the rising, but the falling inﬂectiou, as thns as the
mﬂection best suited to the sense of the empbauc
phrase.

FINAL PA USE.
Rum: XXIV. The ﬁnal T {mac or period in a sen-
tence requires the fallin tujgrtion, and a descending
tone of voice on the concfz-zding words.

EXAMPLES.

Exercise and (em mm-ance strengthen the constitution, and sweeten

Here the words constitution and Iffé, as they suc-
cessively terminate the sentence, naturally assume the
falling inﬂection.

Egrcaption. An exception to this rule has been al~
ready referred to, under the head of Rule XIX. It
occurs where the first part of an antithetic sentence re-
quires the strong emphasis and falling inﬂectioa; in
consequence of which the latter adopts the rising.

A succession of similar members, succeeding each
other in the same sentence, is called a Series.
If these members consist of single words, they form
a Simple Series; if of several, a Compound Series.

SIMPLE SERIES.

RULE XXV. IV hen two members, consisting of sin»

Exercise and témperance strengthen the constitution.

The difference of tone which distinguishes the com-'-
m‘en‘ci‘ng words of this sentence, will be tnuch more
perceptible, by referring to the explanation of the Plate.

r RULE XXVI. A When two members, consisting of sin-
gle words, conclude a sentence, as the last must natural-
ly have the falling inflection, thelast but one ‘assumes
the rising inflection.

The constitution is strengthened by exercise and temperance.

This rule is the converse of the former. It must,
however, be observed, that sentences of this kind,
which can scarcely be called a series of particulars,
may, when commencing. assume a different order of
inflections on the ﬁr-st words, when the succeeding
clause does not conclude the sentence. This may be
illustrated by consulting the Plate No. ill. and IV.;
where we see exercise and tem_pe7'Lmce, when the next
clause concludes the sentence, as in No. Il.l. adopt one
order of inﬂections; and the same words, when the
next clause does not conclude, as in No. IV. adopt a
quite opposite order. Not that this order in No. IV.

When the members of a series consist of several words,

the are under somewhat different laws from those con-
sisttng of single words. In a single series the ear is
chieﬂy consulted, and the inﬂectiooé of voice are so
arranged as to produce the greatest variety; but in a
compound series the understanding takes the lead:
For as a number of similar members of sentences in
succession form ll sort of climax in the sense, this cli-
max can he no way rooouoced so forcibly as by
adopting the same in ectioo which is used for the
strong emphasis; for, by this means, the sense is not
only placed in a more distinct point of view, but the
voice enabled to rise gradually upon every paiticular,
and thus add to force an agreeable variety.

in pronouncing the compound series, therefore, it
mustthe carefully noted, that the second member ought
to he pronounced a little highetgand more forcibly than
the ﬁjrst, the third than the second, and so on: and for

low in succession, they must be pronounced singly, ac-
cording to the number of members in each portion ; and

EXAMPLES.

'1’ he soul consists of many faculties, as the nnderstnnding and the

tion, mny be considered as a concluding series; and as
it forms but one portion of a great series, it may he
considered as a commencing one, and must be pro-
nounced in snbserviency to it; that is, the first and
second word must have the rising, and the last the fall»
ing inﬂection, but without dropping the voice. The
next portion must be pronounced in a similar manner;
that is, the first word with the rising, and the last with
the falling inﬂection, with the voice a little higher and
more foroible on the word here than otwhe word im-
agine : the next portion, being the last but one, alters
its inﬂertions; the first word having the falling and the
last the rising inﬂection, agreeably to the rule laid down
for the Compound Series. i

Upon the first View of this passage, ‘we ﬁnd it natur-
ally falls into certain distinct portions. These portions

INFLECTIONS on THE VOICE. ‘31‘

seem to be ﬁve in number; the first containing two
members, death, ltﬁa ; the second containing three, am-
gels, principal-ities, powers; the third two, things pre-
sent, things to come ; the fourth two, height, depth ; the
ﬁfth one, any other creature: these members, if ‘pro-
nounced at random, and without relation to that order

in which they are placed by the sacred writer, lose half

their beautyyandteffect; but if each member is pro-
nounced With an inﬂection of voice that corresponds to
its situation in the sentence, the whole series becomes
the most striking and beautiful climax imaginable.

In order, then, to pronounce this passage properly,
there ought to be a gradation of force from the ﬁrst
portion to the last; and that this force may have the
greater variety, each portion ought to be accompanied
with a gradation of voice from low to high ; that each
portion also may continue distinct, every portion‘ but
the last should be pronounced as a simple concluding
series, with the falling inﬂection on the last member,
enforcing, and not dropping the voice ; the last mem-
ber, according to the general rule, must have the rising
inﬂection; and in this manner of pronouncing it, the
whole sentence has its greatest possible force, beauty,
and variety. _

From the examples which have been adduced, we
have seen in how many instances the force, variety and
harmony of a sentence have been improved by a pro-
per use of the falling inflection. The series in partic-
ular is indebted to this inflection for its greatest force
and beauty. But it is necessary to observe, that this
inﬂection is not equallyadapted to the pronunciation of
every series: where force, precision, or distinction is
necessary, thisinﬂection very happily expresses the
sense of the sentence, and forms an agreeable climax
of sound to the ear; but where the sense of the sen-
tence does not require this force, precision, or distinc-
tion, which is the case where the sentence cotnmences
with a conditional or suppositive conjunction, or where
the language is plaintive and poetical, the falling inﬂec-—«

tion seems less suitable than the rising: this will be
better perceived by a few exainpl’es.

we are speaking of; ‘and that ‘this -fullness of ‘joy will -be made up of

all those pleasures, which the nature of the soul is capable of receiv-

-ing ? Spectator, N-o. 600..

As the fourth member of this sentence, from its very
nature, requires the rising _i«n.ﬂection, and as the Whole
‘series is constructed on the suptposithve conjunction
seeing ; every particular member of it seems necessa-
rily to require the rising .~in‘ﬂ.ection : for it may be ob-
served as a pretty general rule, that where a condition-
al or a ssupposmve -conj-unvctiontcommences the series, if
‘there is nothing particularly ernpihatical‘-in it, the rising
inﬂection on each pasrticularof -the series is preferable
to the falling, especially if the language be plaintive and
tender. ‘

series of particulars are as seldom to be pronounced‘
with t.he falling ii’iﬂect.ion"*in poetry, as they are tor the
most part to be so pronounced in prose. The reason
of this, perhaps, may be, that, as poetry assumes so
often the ornamental and the plaintive, where a distinct
and emphatic enumeration is not so much the objectas
ainohle or a tender one ; that expression wbichgives
the idea of force and familiarity is not so suitable to
poetry as to prose: asa co*nﬁrm‘a’tion of this were-may

familiar, the falling inflection is then properly adopted

it may he observed, that there are few passages of this
sort in rhysnimg poetry. of the pathetic or ornamental

flectioo.

l.N'l‘ERROGATlO;. .

The most obvious distinction between interrogative
and other sentences is, that as, in other sentences, the
substantive or pronoott precedes the verb it governs, in
an interrogetive sentence, the verb, either auxiliary or
principal, ought always to precede either the substan-
tive or pronoun. Thus, when I speak deolaratively,l
say, I am going to ctillge ; but when I speak interrog-
atively, I say, alre you going to college ? where we ob-
serve, that in the declarative and interrngative sentences,
the ronoun and the verb hold different places.»

Tjhis inversion of the common order of the words in
composition, is accompanied by a similar inversion of
the inflection of voice in pronunciation ; for as the com-
mon order of inflections in a declarative sentence. is that
of placing the rising inflection towards the middle, and
the falling at the end, as in the ﬁrst exam la; the in-
terrogation inverts this order, and uses the ailing inﬁec-
tion of voice in the tnidddle of the sentence, and the
rising on the last word, as in the last example. This
inflection of voice, however, which thus distinguishes
the interrogation, seems entirely conﬁned to those
questions which are formed without the interrogative
pronouns or adverbs. When a_.,qnestion eommences
with one of these, it has invariable the .same.t:~inﬂeetion
as the declarative sentence, unless we have either not
heard, or mistaken an answer just given us: for in that
case, the emphasis is placed on the intermgative word ;
and the voice elevated hythe rising inﬂection on the
end of the sentence. Thus, if weisay simply,iWIzen
do you go to college f1 the word college has the» falling
intﬂectitm‘, and the voice is no more elevated than if,
being acquainted with the time, we ahoold any, .4: that
time I yolt o to cciltege : hot if we have mistaken
the answer that as been given us concerning the time,

we say, tWhén;.(lo-yougo tocollege? we-lay a consider-
ble s.tre.ss upon the word w/2-en, and suspend the voice‘:
with the rising inﬂectionto the end of the sentence‘.
Ag.:a.in; if We ask a question without previouscon-i
versation, or reference’ to any thing that has passed, if
we do notuse the interrogative words, we infallibly use
the risingt inﬂection, and elevate the voice on the ens of
the question ; thus when we meet, andsay--—ﬂre‘you go-5
ing to college? if we have the least; eagerness for inforrnaé
tion. the voiceis elevated and suspended swith t.he rising
inflection on the last word: but if the person we lspeask:
to, either does not hear,-or else mistakes what We say,
so as to. make it necessary to repeat the question, we-
then adopt the falling inflection on the last word, and,

giving it. some degree of emphasis, say, ﬂre you going?

to college? with the same inflection of voice, and in
nearly the same tone, with which we should say simply,
You are now going to college; precisely reversing that
upward turn of voice which distinguishes the first
question. a

Thus we ﬁnd the immediate repetition of the same
question requires a different inflection of voice accord?
ing to its form. When we ask a question commencing
with an interrogative word, as-—W/zen do you go to
college? and froma mistake of the answer about the
time, repeat this que'sti’on, we use the rising inflection
of voice, and elevate itto the end, as-W/zén do you
go to college ‘.3 On the contrary, when We ﬁrst ask a.
question without the interrogative word, we use the
rising inflection, and raise the voice on the-last word,
as--./lire you going to college  and when we repeat the
question, we use the falling ‘inflection of voice on the
last word ;_ and though we may pronounce the. last word
louder than the rest, we do not use the rising inﬂection
as in the former case','but the falling, as-——I say, are you
going to college ? g ,

to ‘p_r0’tH.lﬂClall0tl, all lq<uestimts~ may be divided into two“

ed, may be considered as purely dee.larative,and like
declarative sentences require the falling inflection at the

THE'QUESTION WITH THE INTERROGATIVE
woaos.

RULE XX XIII. T4/hen an rnterrogative sentence com-

imences with any of the interrogative pronouns or ad-

verbs, with respect to 2'-nflectton, elevation, or depression
of voice, it is pronounced‘ exactly like a declarative sen-
tence,
EXAMPLES;

How can he exalt his thoughts to anything great and noble, who

only believes that after a short turn on the stage of this world, he is

to sink intooblivion, and to lose his consciousness for ever? “
Spect. No. 210.

As an illustration of therule, we need only alter two
or three of the words in this example to reduce it tota
declarative sentence ; and we shall‘ find the inflection,
elevation, and depression of voice on every part of it
the same.

» He cannot exalt his thoughts to any thing great or noble,be-
cause he only believes that after-at short turn on the stage of this

world, he is to sink into oblivion, _a_ndCto lose his consciousness for
ever.

Here we perceive, that the two sentences, though one
is an interrogation, and thezother a declaration, end
both with the same inﬂection of voice, and that the
fallhigeinﬂection; but if we-convert these words into an
interrogation, by leaving\ out the interrogativeaword, we
shall soon perceive the difI'e1'ence.a

INFLECTIONS or THE VOICE. 37

EXAMPLE.

Can he exalt his thoughts to any thing great or noble, who only
believes that after a short turn on the stage of this world, he is to
sink into oblivion, and to lose his consciousness for (ever? '

In pronouncing thissentence with propriety, we iﬁncl
the voice slide upwards on the last words, contrary to
the inﬂection it takes in the two former examples.

RULE XXXIV. Interrogative sentences commencing
with interrogative words, and consisting of -members in a
series depending necessarily on each other for sense, are
to be pronounced as a series of members of the same kind
in a declarative sentence.

EXAMPLES.

From whence can he produce such cogent exhortations to the
practice of every virtue, such ardent excitements to piety and devo-
tion, and such assistance to attain them, as those which are to be met
with throughout every page of these inimitable Writings ?

_ }’Vhere, amidst the dark clouds of pagan philosophy, can he shevv

us such. a clear prospect of a ‘future state, the immortality of the
soul, the resurrection of the dead, and the general judgment, as in
St. Paul’s ﬁrst Epistle to the Corinthians? Ibid. page 40.

But to considerithe Paradise Lost only as it regards our present
subject; what can be conceived greater than thebattle of angels,
the majesty of Messiah, the stature and behaviour of Satan and his
peers? what mo_re beautiful than Pandaemonium, Paradise, Heaven,
A’ngels, A’dam, and Eve? what more strange than the creation of
the world, the several metamorphoses of the fallen angelsfand the
surprising adventures their leader meets with in his search after par-
adise ? Spect. No. 418.

In these sentences, we ﬁnd the same pauses and in-
flections of voice take place as in the diﬁ"e1'ent series of
declarative sentences. The two first examples con-
taining the compound series maybe referred to Rule
XXXI ; andhthe third, which forms a Series of Series,
to Rule XXXH. ‘

But the question which in reading and speaking pro-
duces the greatest force and variety, is that which is
formed without the interrogative Words.

THE QUESTION EWITHOUT THE INTERROGATIVE
WORDS.

RULE XXXV. When an interrogative sentence is
formed without the interrogative words, the last word must
have the rising inflection : and  there be an emphati-
cal word in thelast member, followed lzyseveral . words
depending on it, which conclude the sentence, both the em:
phatical word and the concluding words areto be pro-
nounced with the rising inﬂection. Thus the Words
making one, and cause of the shipwreck, in the two fol-
lowing examples, have all the rising inflection.

EXAMPLE&, ,
Would it not employ a beau prettily enough, if, instead of eternal-

'ly playingwith his snuff-box, he spent some part of his time in mak-

ing one ? Spectator, N o. 43./"
.,If the owner of a vessel had ﬁtted it out with every thing necessa-
ry, and provided to the utmost of his power against the dangers of
the sea, and a storm should afterwards arise and break the masts,
would any one in that case accuse him of'~being the cause of the
shipwreck? Demosthenes on the Crown. Rollin.

In these examples we ﬁnd, that however variously
the Voice may employ itself on the rest of the sentence,

the concluding words in the last member must necessa-
rily be suspended with the rising inﬂection.

RULE XXXVI. .When two interrogative sentences
connected by the disjunctive or, succeed eachother, the
first ends with the rising, and the last with the falling
inflection.

EXAMPLES.

Shall we in your person crown the-author of the public calami-
ties, orashall we destroy him ? .H*?sc/tines on the Crown. Rollin.

. Is the goodness, or Wisdom of the divine Being, more manifested
in this his proceeding? Spect. No. 519.

_ The necessity of attending. to this rule, when ‘two
things are distinguished and opposed to each other,
will appear clearly. from the following palssage.

See Falkland dies, the virtuous and thejust,
See god-like Turenne prostrate on the dust 5
See Sydney bleeds amid the martial stsrife;
Was this their virtue or contempt of life?
Essay on Man ,- Epist. iv. v. 99.

INFLECTIONS or THE VOICE. 39

If, in reading this passage, the voice were‘to.iadopt
the same inflection both ‘on, mi-rtue and on contempt of
ltﬁ, and to end the last braiich of the question as well
as the first with the rising inﬂectibn,‘ theldistinction, so
strongly marked by the sense, would be utterlyslost’:
whereas, if we endi'viirtue‘witli the rising, and life w’i'th
the "falling: inﬂection,the dis”'ti‘"ri‘c‘t’iocn evidently appears.
But in theifollowing passagefrom Shakspeare we have
an instance of the necessity of a contrary modeof‘ pro-
nuncsciation, arising from the siinilitude of objects con‘-
nected by the conjttnctive 07‘:-

’Is this the nature,

Which passion could not sliake? whose solid virtue,

The shot of accident, orjdart of chence _

Could neither réze nor pierce ? Othello.
M In this passage, the shot of accident and the dart of
chance, being only differenit words for the same thing,
the word or conjoins them; and to avoid any ‘impli_c,a-
tion that they mean different things, the same inﬂection
of. voice ought to he on-them both, that is, the rising
ipﬂwescjtion :, ,.b.ut_in* the~las;_t member, Where the" opposi-
tion is evident, both .f.I‘0fIl the sense of the words, and
the daisjunctiver nor, the ‘falling inflection ought to be
laid on raze, and thetrising on pierce.

For the same reason, in reading the following stanza

vol” G'r“ay"s Elegy in‘ ~a~C?oaniry Church-yard, it: should

seem “by much the mosteligible method to suspend the
voice withzthe rising inﬂeicti-on on the word death :
Can story’d urn oranimated bust,

Back to its mansion call the ﬂeeting breath ?

_C,anh0n~.out;’,s _voice_provol{e the silent dust,

Or ﬂattery sooth the dull cold ear of death?

As the sense of the word or, that is, whether it
means conjunction or disjunction, is not always very
obvious, it may not be useless to propose the following
rule: if we are in doubt whether or is conjunctive or
disjunctive, let us make use of this parapl1rase——t7f'2It-is
not so, is it so? and if the sense will bear this _para-
phrase, the or is disjunctive, and the subsequent ques-
tion ought to have the falling inflection : if it will not

40 ART or READING.

bear it, the or .is conjunctive, and the subsequent ques-
tion ought to have the rising inflection. Thus if we
paraphrase thestanza just‘ quoted, We shall find -the
or conjunctive. If storied urn cannot call back the
ﬂeeting breath, can animated hast call it hark ‘.3 If hon-

our’s voice cannot provoke the silent dust, can ﬂattery,

sooth the dull cold ear of “death 

“If this paraphrase does not seem suitable to the gen-
eral import of the sentence, it is because the objects
are not put in opposition or contradistinction to each
other; the or therefore is conjunctive, and consequent-
li , the latter uestion re uires the risin inflection as

9 s ‘1   . 3. . .
Well as the former: but where the or is disjunctive, we
ﬁnd this paraphrase very suitable Ito‘ the general import
of the sentence. Thus in the} following sentence.

But should these credulous inﬁdels: aftei: all be in the right, and this
pretended revelation be all ‘a fables; "from believingitv what hariri
could ensue? would it render princes more tyrannical, or su»bj'ec.-ts
more ungéivernable, the rich more insnlent or the poor more disor-
derly? Would it make Worse pai*e;hi§$, or children, husbands, or
wives; maters or servants, friends, or: neighbours ? ‘or would ﬂitnot
make men more virtuous, and, contseqpently, more happy in every
situation?  Jen-yns. ’

If We try the paraphrase iuponithe former, parts of
this sentence, We sall ﬁnd it as repugnant to the sense
asiin the former example; but ifivve applyit -to the last
member, we shall ﬁnd it pei‘feetl_y accord with the
meaning of the author. Thus we may say——If at will
not ma/ce worse parents or children, husbands or wtves,
masters or servants, ﬂiends or netghhours ; wtll tt not
make men more virtuous, and, ,_coinseg§'u\ently,, more happy
in every situation C’?-——if'ron_i wlieiice we may conclude,
that in the former part-of this passage, the or is con-
junctive, and suspends the Voice‘? at the end ofevery
member, and that the last or is disjunctive, and requires
the sentence to end with the falling inﬂection.

RULE XXXVII. Interrogat-ive sentences, without in-
terrogative words, when consisting of a variety of mem-
bers necessarily depending on each other for sense, admzt

of every tone, pause, and z'nﬁect~ien‘of voice, ‘common to

other sentences, provided the last member, on which the
whole question depends, has that peculiar elevation and
inflection of voice which distinguishes this species of in-
ter-rogation.

EXAMPLE.

But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual pron
gress of improvements, and travelling on from perfection to perfec-
tion, after having just looked abroad into the Works of its Creator,

’ and made afew discoveries of his inﬁnite goodness, Wisdom, and

power, must perish at her first setting out, and in the very beginning
of her inquiries? _ Spect. No. 111.

In reading this passagewe shall ﬁnd, that placing the
falling inﬂection withoutdropping the voice on the words
improvements and Creator, will not only prevent the
monotony which is apt to arise from too long a suspen-
sion of the voice, but enforce the sense by enumerating,
as it were, the several particulars of which the question
consists.

EXAMPLE.

Do you think that Themistocles, and the heroes who were killed
in the battles of Marathon and Plataea; do you think the very tombs
of your ancestors will not send forth groans, if you crown a man,
who, by his own confession, haslbeen for ever conspiring with bar-
barians to ruin Greece 5’ Jflschines on the Cro-wn. Rollin.

This passage will be rendered much more forcible
and harmonious, if, instead of suspending the Voice
throughout, we make use of the falling inflection with-=
out dropping the voice on the words ?iat(ea and con-—
ﬁzssion. t

RULE. XXXVHL Interrogutive sentences formed
without the 7.m‘erroga.t’ive words, and consisting of inemé
hers in (15 series, which formjoetfect sense as they proceed,

must have every member tezrminoste uvith the inflection of

voice peculiozr to this species of interrogation-.

their country to his mercy, andreceive such laws as a conqueror—a
conqueror they attacked first, shall think ﬁt to prescribe them ?
' ' Eschines on the Crown. Rollin.
It need scarcely be observed, that in order to pre-
vent the monotony to which this passage is very liable
in reading, we ought to begin the ﬁrst question as soft
as possible, that the voice may pronounce them all with
an increasing force to the‘ last.
But did you, (0 what title shall I give you!) did you betray the

least shadow of displeasure against me, when I broke the chords of
that. harmony in your presence, and dispossessed the commonwealth

of the advantages of that confederacy, which you magnify so much‘

with the loudest strains of your theatrical voice." did you ascend the
rostrum? did you denounce, or once explain those crimes, with

_which you are new pleased to charge me ?

Demosthenes on the Crown. Rollin.

In this and the preceding sentence, we shall find the

‘ear relieved, and the sense greatly enforced, by placing

Aﬁed ? * i

the falling inﬂection with emphasis in a high tone of
voice on the words conqueror, first, and explazn, accord-

ing to Rule XXXVII.

VVould an inﬁnitely wise Being make such glorious beings for so
mean a purpose? can he delight in the production of such abértive
intelligence, such sh<5rt-lived reasonable beings? would he give us
talents that are not to be exerted, capacities that are not to be grati-

- Spcct. No. 111.

In the reading of every series here produced, it will
be necessary to increase the force at the same time that
We preserve the rising inflection on the last word or
member of every one.

This Rule and the last are well’ illustrated in the fol-
lowing passage of Shakspeare’s Henry V. where that
monarch, after discovering the conspiracy against him,
thus upbraids Lord Scroop, who was concerned in it.

Oh how hast thou with jealousy infected

The sweetness of aﬁiance! show men dutiful?

Why so didst thou : or seem they grave and learned?
VVhy so didst" thou: come they of a noble family 3
Why so didst thou : seem they religious?

Why so didst thou : or are they spare in diet ;

Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood 5

‘INFLECTIONS on THE VOICE. 43

GaIaished' and decked in modest complement,
Not working with the eye without the éar,
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
Such and so ﬁnely boulted didst thou seem. ‘

t In pronouncing this passage, it should seem most el- ,

igible to use the rising inﬂection at the end of the sev-
eral questions: but after the four ﬁrst, the falling inﬂec-
tion seems very properly adopted on the word diet, as
this is the first branch of the last series of questions;
and as this series continues for several lines, provided
the voice be but inflected upwards on the last member
at neither, the rest of the parts may be pronounced as is

most suitable tothe sense and harmony of the whole,
according to Rule XXXVII.

Exception. The exception to this rule is, when each
successive memberin a series is contrasted or opposed
to the preceding; for in this case though the first is ele-
vated as in other interrogations, not commencing with
interrogative words, the rest of the questions assume
the declarative tone, and fall gradually into a period.

EXAMPLE.

As for the particular occasion of these charity schools, there can-
not any offer more worthy a generous mind. Would you do a hand-
some thing Without retiirn ?---do it for an infant that is not sensible
of the obligation. Would you do it for the public good ?--do it for
one who will be an honest artiﬁcer. Would you do it for the sake
of heaven ?—-give it for one who shall be instructed in the worship
of Him for whose sake you gave it. Spam‘. No. 294.

In tl's example there is evidently an opposition in
the interrogations which is equivalent to the disjunctive
or; and if the ellipsis were supplied, which this oppo-
sition suggests, the sentence would run thus: If you
will not do a handsome thing wit/tout return, would you
do it for the public good? and  not for the public
good, would you do it for the sake of heaven : so that
this exception may be said to come under Rule
XXXVI.

The ground of this exception will he still more evi-
dent, if the last series of questions and answers be com-
pared with the following, where no opposition existing,
the rising inﬂection is retained.

EXAMPLE.

My departure is objected to me, which charge III’-Minot answer’

Without commending myself. For What must 1 say? That I ﬂed
from the consciousness of guilt? But what is charged upon me as a
crime, was so far from being a fault, that it is the most glorious ac-
tion since the memory of man. That I feared being Called to an
account by the pe(’)ple?_ That was never tftlked 0f; and if it had
been done, I should have come otfwitb» double honour. That I

1 was afraid of death? That is a calumny. I must, therefore, say.
what I would not, unless compelled to it, thatl withdrew to preserve

It may be remarked here that whenever questions
and answers thus succeed each other, it is necessary, in
order to. distinguish them properly, to pronounce the
latter‘ in a lower tone than the former, and to make a
long pause after each question.

‘One more observation is necessary before we termi-
nate this subject; that as questions, which demand the
rising inflection at the end, especially when they are
drawn out to any length, are apt to carry the voice into
a higher key than is either suitable or pleasant, too

much care cannot be taken to keep the voice down,

when we are pronouncing the former parts ofa long ques-
tion, and the commencing questions of along succes-

sion of questions 3 for as the characteristic pronuncia-'

tion of these questions is, to end with the rising inflec-
tion, provided we do but terminate with this, the voice
may creep on in a low and almost unvaried tone till the
end; and then if the voice is not agreeable in a high
key, which is the case with the generality of voices,
the last word of the whole may be pronounced with the
rising inﬂection, in nearly the same low key in. which
the voice commences.

EXCLAMATION,

The note of exclamation is usually employed, to in-
dicate that some passion or.emotion is contained in the
words to whichit is annexed.

As almost all forms of expression admit, under cer-
tain circumstances, of this addition, no general rule can
be given for the inﬂection which should accompany it.

integrity of the rincipal members, the parenthesis

better preserves the broken sense, and distinguishes the
exptartation from the text. For that this is always the

the case in prose, and often in poetry, too much care
cannot be taken to read’ them in so ditferettt zt tone of
voice from the rest at‘ the sentence, as may keep them
perfecttly separate and distinct : this is to be done, not
only by lowering the voice, but by pl‘0nt‘)t.IttClt‘tg the pa-
renthesis more rapidly, and by gltting a degree of same-
ness to the voice, which may dlstinguislt the parentlte-
sis from the parts which inclase it: and we must never
forget, that when the pttrenthetic clause is pmnotrnced,
the voice, after a short pause, must recover the ltlglter
tone it fell from, in order to preserve the connexioat in
the thought. Without these precauticms it will often be
impossible to pronounce Milton so as to make him in-
telligible. That sublime and excursive genius is like
Homer, freqtlexttly, by the beauty of an itttervenittg
lllottglll, carried so lttt‘ out of the direct line of his sash-

ject as to make it impossible for his reader to preserve

the direct line, but by cllstlnguisltixtg those thoughts that

Under this article, perhaps, may be arranged aside
speeches in dramatic works, and all the intervening ex-

planatory members innarrative writing: for both these’

species of members, like the parenthesis, require both a
lower tone of V0106 and. a more rapid pronunciation,

In this passage are no lesslthan three parentheses;
the ﬁrst and last, accordingto the general rule, end with
the rising inﬂection; bnti1.helt,niddle parenthetic mem-
ber ending with two emphatieobjects, t_he last of which
requires the falling inﬂection, the general rule must be
dispensed with. The reason of this exception will be
particularly considered under the iihead of Emphasis.

ACCENT;

As Accent relates to the pronunciation of words taken
singly, it can have little-to do-in an essay on the pro-
nunciation of words in succession; for as words justly
pronounced are merely .the ,m‘iatet*ials for delivery, these
must all be supposed topbe in our own possession before
we can possibly begin to arrange and display them to
advantage. A person who pronounces every word
singly with the greatest purity, maynot be able to read
Well; and another may convey the sense of an author
with great force and beauty, who does not always either
pronounce the words justly, or place the accent on the
"proper syllable. The only point, therefore, in which it

INFLECTIONS or‘ THE VOICE. 49

will be necessary to take noti"ce ;_oIT accent. in reading, is
that where the emphasis regquiresa transpositionof it’:
this happenswben two words which havea sameness
in part of their formation, are opposed to each other in
sense. Thus, if I pronounce the words justice and in‘-
justice as single words, I naturally place the accent on
the penultimate syllable of both; but if I contrast them,
and say, Neither justice nor injustice have any thing ‘to
do with the present question; in this sentence 1 natural-
ly place the accent on the ﬁrst syllable of injustice, in

order the more forcibly and clearly to distinguish it

from justice. This transposition of the accent, which
is so evidently dictated by the sense, extends itself to
all iwords which have a sameness of termination, though’
they may not be directly opposite in sense; thus, if I
wanted more particularly to show that I meant one re-
quisite of dramatic story rather than another, I should
say, In this species of comfposit-ion, plausibility is much
more essential than probability; and in the proniincia—-
tion of these words, I should infallibly transpose the
accent‘ of both, from the third to the first syllables; in
order to contrast those parts of the words which are
distinguished from each other by the import of the sen-
tence. Hence the following Rule.

RULE XL. VI/hen two words with similar termin-
ations are placed in opposition to each other, the ac-
cent on one or both is often ‘varied, to express the contrast
more strongly.

A EXAMPLE;

In this case I may use the saying of an eminent wit, who upon
somegreat. men’s pressing him to forgive his daughter who hadmar-
ried against his consent, told them he could refuse nothing to their
instances, but that he would have them remember there was a differ-
ence between giving and for giving.

In this example, we ﬁnd the whole sense of the pas-
sage depends on placing the accent on the first svllable
- 0 a — . , J "‘
0l.]j0?‘g'l'Ut’tlg, in order to contrast it more strongly with
g.ii2i,iig, to which it is opposed; as, witiiout this transpo-

EMPIIASIS.

Emphasis is that stress which is placed on certain
worrls in a sentence, to distinguish them from the rest.
Taken in this must general sense, Emphasis ma)’ be
divided into two kinds; that which arises from the pe-
culiar sense of one or two words in :1 sentence; and
that which arises from the greater importance of nouns,
verlls, and other signiﬁcant worth, than of connectives
atttl pttrtieles. .The last Empltasis takes place on al-
most every word in it sentence. except the articles,
prepesitinns and smaller parts of speech; and by pm-
nouncing these lieehly, we give a force to the other

This liritttgs us to it tl‘l{‘€3€l.(‘)l(l distinction of words in

Em;)ll‘d$lS, that our attention will now he directed.

The principal circumstance that tlistixtguisltes ent-
phrttienl words limit others, seems to he a 7tterttt.i1tg' 1“t47’hIl(»’/t
points out, or dtZt‘(:iztgt1t's/net .90:rz(*(/ti-rzg an tlistinct or_qpp0-
mitt: to some at/mt’ I/¢t'n,g'. When this opposition is ex-
pressecl in tvorcls, it liorrns an antithesis, the opposite
ports of which are always empltatical. Thus in the
following conplet from Pope :

‘Tits ham! to say, if greater want of skill
Appear in writing or in judging ill.

The words writing and jti(1gi2tg* are opposed to eztclt
other, and are therefore the emphatical words: where
we may likewise observe, that the (lisjtmctive or, hy
which the tmtithesis is connected, means one of the
tltiugs exclusively of the other.

The same may be observed in another couplet frotn
the same author; where one branch of the antithesis is
not expressed but understood :

Get wealth and place, if pnsatihle with gtraee,
If not by any xneans get wealth and place.

Here it appears evidently, that the words any means,
-Wlticll are the most emphaticel, are directly opposed to
the means understood by the word grace, and the last
line is perfectly equivalent to this: If not by these
means, by any other means, get wealth and place.

Now, if M: lay a consitltmtble degree of etnpltasis
upon the tmnls good sense, it will sttrtmgly sttggest that
the petitple ltere tttetttimtetl are not common or ordinzt-
ry people, which, tlmuglt not oppnsite to the ttteatting
of the writer, does not seem necessaty either to the
cotnpletlmt or embellishment of it; for as partlculm*ly

tmtrkhtg these people out as persons of good st:nse,_

seems tn obviate an objection that they mlgltt possibly
be fools, and as it would not be very ttise to suppose
this objection, it would sltow as little wistlnttt to endea-
vmtr to preclude it by a mare than ordinary stress;
the plain words of the autltor, therelhre, without any
out tlmsls rm them, sufficiently show his meaning.
[grout these observations, the following deﬁnition of
emphasis seems naturally to arise : enzplzasis, vrlten ap-
plied to particular wards, is that sfress we lay on words;

pressed or understood. And hence will follow this gem
oral rule : H"Iteret.-er there is cotttmdistittctioit in the
Sense of the words, there ought to be empltnsis in the pro»
ntutcicztiort of them; the converse of this being equally
trite, W/tercvcr we place critpltttsis, we suggest the {rim
of cotzttradistinction.

Having thus ascertained the nature of Emphasis,
we are next to consider the inflections it requires.
Much of this subject indeed has been anticipated in
speaking of Antithcsis; ondyin the exceptions to the
foregoing rules the peculiarities of emphatic sentences
are mostly explained. Some farther remarks however
on these topics have been reserved for this place.

EMPHATIC INFLECTION.

It was noticed under Rule XXIV. that where the
last member of it sentence was ttegzttive, in opposition
to :1 positive expression in the first, the usual order of
inflections was inverted. the last member taking the ris~
ittg, and the first the falling infieetion. An instance of
this occurs in the following sentence:

When a Persian soldier was reviling Alexontler the Great, his offi-
cer reprimanded him by saying: Sir, you were paid to fight Alexan-
der, and not to rail at him.

Here we find fight and rail are the two emphatic
words which correspond to each other, and that the
positive member which affirms something, adopts the
falling inflection on tight, and the negative member
which eztclutles something, has the rising inflection on
mil. Something like this will he found to take place
where only one part of an Antithessis is expressed :

By the faculty ofa lively and picturesque imagination, a man in it
dungeon is capnhie of entertaining himself with scenes and land-

scapes, more beautiful than any that can be found in the whole corn»
pass of nature.

Here we find the emphatical word dungeon, requiring
the falling ittflection ; and if we draw out the sentence
at length, sup lying the words suggested by the sense,
we shall find it consist of the some positive and name»

tive parts as the former, and that the positive part as»

sumes the falling, and the negative the rising inﬂection
in both. i

EXAMPLES.

When a Persian soldier was reviling Alexander the Great, his oﬁi-
cer reprimanded him by saying’; Sir, you were paid to f ight Alex:-i
ander, and not to rdil at him. ‘

.By the faculty of a lively and picturesque imagination, a man in
a, dimgeogn and not merely dbsent fromrbeautiful scenes, is capable of
entertaining himself with scenes and landscapes, more beautiful than
any that can be found in the whole compass of nature.

Now, whatever be the reason why the positive mem-.
ber of a sentence should adopt the emphasis with the
falling inflection, and the negative member the rising ;.
it is certain, that this appropriation of emphatic inflec-
tion, to a positive or negative‘signit_ication, runs through:
the whole system of pronunciation. Agreeably to this
arrangement, we constantly ﬁnd good -readers finish
negative sentences with the rising inﬂection, where or-
dinary readers are sure totutse the falling inflection, and
to drop the voice; and,‘ perhaps,. this different pronun-
ciation forms one of the greatest diff,‘erenc.es between
good and bad readers; Thus, in the following sentence
lloin, the Oration of Demosthen-es on the Crown, trans-
lated by Dr. Leland:

Observe then, ]Escl1ines ; our ancestors acted thus in both these
instances; not that they acted for their benefactors, not that they

saw no danger in these expeditions. Such considerations never ‘

could. induce them to abandon those who ﬂed to their protection.
No, from. the nobler motives of glory‘ and. rent‘-)w.n,. they devoted
their services to the. distressed;

There» are few good readers who- will not pronounce-
the two first sentences of this passage so as to termin-
ate them with the rising inflection 5 and this manner of

reading them we find agreeable to the paraphrase sug-,

gested. by the falling inflection adopted in the several:
clauses of the last sentence ;. bylwhich all the sen-
tences of this passage» form parts of one thought, and

are reduced to the deﬁnition of emphasis already giv-  

en; as, They acted from the noblerx inot-ives of glory:
and reno‘wn,s and not injierzor motives.

INFLECTIONS or THE voice. 55‘

‘Wherever, therefore, a negative sentence, or member
of a sentence, is in opposition to a positive sentence, or
member of a sentence, we ﬁnd it usually adopt the
rising inflection: And even where there is no corres-
pondent positive member or sentence expressed, if the
negative member or sentence would admit of a positive,
and the senseof this positive-is agreeable to the gen-
eral tenor of the composition; in this case, likewise,
we ﬁnd the negative member or sentence adopt the ris-
ing inﬂection. Thus, in the same oration, Demosthe-
nes, speaking of the ,public works he had ‘erected,

As to those "public works, so-' much, the object of your ridicule,
they undoubtedly demand a due share of honour andapplause; but
I rate them far beneath the great merit of my administration. It is
not with stones nor bricks that [Cliave fortiﬁed the city. It is not
from works like these that I’ derive my reputation. Would you
know my’ methods of fortify-ing? -Examine, and you will ﬁnd them

in the arms, the towns, the territories, the harbours I have secured;
the navies, the troops, the armies I have raised.

The two middle negative sentencesof this passage
have not any correspondent positive sentences preced-
ing or following them ; but the rising inflection on these
sentences suggests a meaning so compatible with the
mind ofthe speaker, that we cannot doubt of its being the
true one ; for it is equivalent to saying, It is not with
tvorlcs [take these that 1’ have fortiﬁed the city, but with
sometlténg much better. This will receive a farther il-
lustration from another passage of the same orator.

For if you now pronounce, that, as my public conduct hath not
been right, Ctesiphon must stand condemned, it must be thought
that yourselves have acted wrong, not that you owe your present
state to the Caprice of fortune. But it cannot be-., No, my country»-

Persian ﬂeet at Salamis! who fought at Artemisium ! By all those
illustrious soils of Athens, whose remains lie deposited in the public
monuments! All of whom received the same honourable interment
from their country: Not those only who prevailed, not those only

56 ART 013‘ i RE:AD.INfe;

The two last members of the ﬁrst'senten’ce~we ﬁnd
naturallyradopt their speciﬁc inflections; that is, the po-
sitive member, the falling on wrong, and the negative
the-rising on fortune. The succeeding sentence has a
negation in it that suits the rising ‘inflection much bet-
ter than the ‘falling, and therefore~‘Greece ha-svveryi pro’-
perly the rising inflection; and*the- latter members, not
those only who prevailed, not those only who were victori-v
ous, will not admit of the falhngsinﬂection Without an
evident’ prejudice to the sense.

From these observations, We may derive the follow-
ing rule. ‘ A

positive and ‘negative part, if this positive and negative
imports that something is oﬂirmed in one part and some-
thing denied in the other, the positiveenznst have the fall-

GENERAL EMPHASIS.

Hitherto emphasis has been considered as appropri-
ated to a particular Word in assenten-ice, the peculiar
sense of which demanded an increase of force, and an
inflection tcorrespondent to that sense ; .but.there is be--
side this, an emphatic force, which, when the composi-
tion is very animated, and va__p;proar.clie's to a close, we

INFLECTIONS on THE VOICE. 57

often lay upon several words in succession. This siic-A
cessive emphatic force does not, like the former, suggest
any particular meaning excluded ‘by it, and therefore
may not improperly be called a general emphasis. This
emphasis is not so much regulated by the sense of the
author as by the taste, and feelings of the reader, and
thereforedoes not admit of any certain rule; but as it
is very strong and energetic when it is happily applied,
it may not be useless to illustrate its nature by a few
examples, a

When Lucius in Cato seems to have exhausted ev-
ery topic in favour of giving up a hopeless war and
submitting to Caesar, he concludes with this emphatic
period : A
L What men could do,

Is done already: Heaven and earth will witness,
I’f Rome mitst fdll, that We are innocent.

The common manner of pronouncing this lastline is
to lay an emphasis with the rising inflection on the word
must, which is certainly a very just one, and may be
called the particular emphasis; but if we place an eni-
phasis on each of the four words.  Rome must fall ;
that is, the emphasis with the rising inﬂection on 
that with the falling on Rome and must, and that with
the rising on fall; if these emphases are pronounced

with a distinct pause after each, it is inconceivable what,

force will be given to these few words. *
In the same manner, when Demosthenes is describ-
ing the former helpless state of Athens, he says,

There was a time, then, my fellow-citizens, when the Lacedemo-.
niaiis were sovereign masters both by sea and land; when their
troopsiand forts surrounded the entire circuit of Attica; when they
posse:-ssed Euboea, Tanagra,the whole Boeotian district, Megara, [_Egi-
'na,'Cleone, and the other islands; While this state had not one ship,
not o’ne wc‘zll. »

The general mode oflpronouncing the last member
of this sentence is, to lay an emphasis on the last word,
wall. This is unquestionably proper; but if we lay an
emphasis on the three last words, that is, the falling on
not, the rising on one, and the falling on wall, and.pause
very distinctly between each, we shall be at no loss to
tlecide on the superiority of this general emphasis,

RULIZS FOR READING VERSE.

Whatever ditliculties we may ﬁnd in reading prose,
they are greatly increased wlten the composition is in
verse; and more particularly if the verse he rhyme.
The t‘C*g;tIlt1t‘lIy of the feet, and the sameness of sound in
rltymiug verse, strongly solicits the voice tn a sameness
of tone; and tom‘-2, unless (llt‘€Clt3(l by a judicious ear, is
apt to dtzgenemte into it sung, antl a song,0f all others, the
most disgusting to a })E3i'.'St.)!) hi‘ just taste. If, tlterefore,
tlzere are few wlto read prose with propriety, there are
still fewer Wilt) succeetl in verse; they either want that
equahle and ltarmtmious ﬂaw of sound which distin-
guishes it from ltmse umneasuretl composition, or they
have not a suﬂicient delicacy of ear ta keep the harmo~
nious smtmtlmess of verse from sliding into :1 whining
chant ; nay, so agreeable is this chant to many l‘€'3{}l£!l'S,
that :1 simple and natural delivery of verse seems tame
and insipid, and much too fatnilittr for the digttity of
the lattgmtge. So pemiciotts are bad habits in every
exercise of the faculties, that they not nnly lead us to

false objects of beauty and propriety, but at last dehrivt:

those, therefore, whose ears are not just, and who are
totally deﬁcient in a true taste for the music of poetry,
the best method of avoiding this impropriety is to read.
verse exactly‘ as if it were , prose ; for though this may
be said to be an error, it is certainly an error on the
safer side. A

To say, hotivever, as some do, thatthe pronunciation
of verse  entirely destitute of song, and that it is no
more than a just pI’0Dt'tl”tt;‘-ia't.iO1l of prose, is as distant
from truth, as the wliining chant We have been speaking
of, is from true poetic harmony. Poetry without song
is a body Without a soul. The tune of this song is, in-
deed, dlfﬁctllt to hit; but when once it is hit, it is sure
to give the most ex.quisit:epleasure. . It excites in the
hearer the most eager desire of imitation; and if this
desire be not accompanied by a just taste or good in-

. struction, it generally substitutes the sing song, as it is

called, for simple, elegant poetic harmony.

It has been already‘ remarked, that the ‘ different in-
ﬂec-tions of voice upon particular words are less per-
ceptible in verse than in prose; and that in the former,

the voice sometimes entirely sinks the inflection, and

slides into a monotone. ‘This approach to a mono-
tone, especially in plaintive poetry, makes it often difﬁ-
cult, and sometimes impossible to distinguish whether
the slides that accompany the pauses and emphasis oi
Verse are rising or falling; and at those pauses where
we can easily distinguish the inﬂeetions, we sometimes
ﬁnd them different from such as we should adopt in
reading the passage if it were prose; that is, we often
ﬁnd therising inflection" at apause in verse, where, if it

were prose, we should use the lialling. it may be ob~
. served,” indeed, that~it is in the frequent use of the ris-

ing inﬂection, where prose would adopt the falling, that

this is expressive of awe, a.rlrniration, and melancholy;
where the mind may be saidto be passive: and it is
this general tendency of the plaintive tone to assume

the rising infiection, which int-lines iaijndiciotis readers

to adopt it at those pauseswhere the falling infiection is
absolutely ‘necessary; in C0l']S€ql,tE3l](‘.e of.whic.h the
pronunciation degenerates into the whine, so much and
so justly disiiked‘; forit is very remarkable, that it‘,
Where the sense concludes, we are careful to preserve
the falling inflection,‘ and let the voice drop into the
natural tal§<ing tone, the voice may he suspended in the
rising inﬂection on any other part of the verse, with
very ‘little danger of falling into the chant of had read-
ers; Thus in the following passage which opens the
tragedy of ' Cato: s
The dawn is overcast, the morning lowers,

And heavily in clouds brings on the day ;

The great, the important day,

Bigwith the fate of Cato and of Rome. ‘

The grandeur of the ohjects and swell of language
in this description, naturally throw the voice into those
tones that express the aweand dignity which those ob-
jects excite in the mind; and these tones being inclined
to the plaintive, naturally slide into the rising inflection
on the pauses; and this is apt todraw the voice into a
chant: but Let the word Rome have the falling inflec-
tion and sink into a lqwet‘ key, in the natural talking
tone, and the imperfections in pronouncing the fr>i'rne’r
part will be in a great measure covered; on the contra-
ry, though the former part be pronouncedever so ac-
curately, if the word Rome has the rising inflection, the

Whole will appear toubei unﬁnished, and have a disa-,

all these cases may be found in the following example
from Pope :

He who through vast immensity can pierce,
See worlds on worlds compose one tmiversc ;
Observe how systteni into .~sy5tern rttns,

What nl.l!(3l" planets circle other sitns;

And drawn supports, upheld by (jod, or thee ?

If this passage were prose, every line hut the fifth
iniglit end with the falling inﬂection, like El commencing
series of live members; but the ﬁfth being that where
the two principal constructive parts unite, and the sense
begins to form, liere, both in prose and verse, must be
the )rin(:ipal pause, and the rising inflection.

liaving premised these observations, we proceed to
give some particular rules for the proper pronunciation
of verse.

RULE XLII. .43 the ewe! tone of the passions, or
emotions, which verse excites, is not at ﬂrst easy to hit, it
will be proper always to begin. a poem in at simple and
almost prosaic style, and so proceed till we are warmed
it-itlt the subject, and feel the emotion we wish to express.

Thus in Gray’s Elegy in a Country Church-yard, if
we cannot immediately strike into the solemn style with
which that poem begins, it will be better to commence
with an easier and less marked tone, and somewhat like
the style of reading prose, till the subject becomes a
little familiar. There are few poems which will not
allow of this prosaic commencement; and where they
do not, it is a much less fault in reading to begin with
too little emphasis, than either to strike into a wrong one,
or to execute the right emphasis awkwardly. Gray’s
Elegy on the Estirpation of the Bards, is almost the

6

(.32 ART or mzmmo.

only one that does not admit of commencing mod-
erately.

Ruin seize thee, ruthless king!
Confusion on thy banners wait! ts;-c.

RULE XLHI. In verse every syllable is to have the
same accent, and every word the same emphasis as inprose.

Though the rhythmical arrangement of the accent
and emphasis is the very deﬁnition of poetry, yet, if
this arrangement tends to give an emphasis to words
which would have none in prose, or an accent to such
syllables as have properly no accent, the rltythmus, or
music of the verse, must be entirely neglected. Thus
the article the ought never to have a stress, though
placed in that part of the verse where the ear expects
an accent.

Of all the entrees which conspire to blind

i\lt1n’3 erring judgment, and miagnide the mind,

What the weak head with strongest bias rules,

Is pride; the never falling vice of fools. Pope.
An injudicious render of verse would he very apt to lay
5:-atress upon the article the in the third line, but :1 good
reader would infallibly neglect the stress on this, and
transfer it to the words what and resale. Thus also in
the following, example, no stress must be laid on the
word of; because we should not give it any in prosaic
pronuncmtton :

Ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made

Teller and stronger than the weed.s they shade. lbid.

For the some reason the word as, either in the first
or second line of the following couplet, ought to have no
stress :

Eye natures walks, shoot folly as it dies,
And catch the manners living as they rise. Ibid.
The last syllable of the word excellent, in the following
coupler, being the place of the stress, is very apt to
draw the organs to a wrong pronunciation of the word,
in compliance with the rhythtnus of the verse :

Their praise is still the style is excellent:
The sense they humbly take upon content Ibid.

INFLECTIONS or rm: VOICE. 53

But a stress upon the last syllable of this word must be
avoided upon pain of the greatest possible reproach to
a good reader; nhich is that of altering the accent of
a word, to indulge the ear in a childish jingle of sylla-
bles. The same may be observed ofthe word eloquence
and the particle the in the following couplet:
False eloquence like the prismatic glass
Its gaudy colours spreads on every place. lbid.

If in compliance with the rhythmus, or tune of the
verse, we were to lay a stress on the last syllable of
eloquence, and on the particle the in the first of these
verses, scarcely any thing can be conceived more dis-
gusting tn :1 good judge of reading.

A bad fault opposite to this is very common among
bad readers; and that is, hurrying over the two last syl-
lables of such words so as to reduce the pronunciation
to prose : for it must be carefully noted, that the beauty
of reading verse depends exceedingly upon the tone in
wltich we pronounce it. The unaccented syllables,
though less forcible, ought to have the same time as
those that are accented ; a regular march, an agreeable
movement, ought to reign through the whole.

This rule, however, with respect to the place of the
accent, admits of some few exceptions. Milton has
sometimes placed words so nnfavonrably for pronuncia-
tion in the coinmon way, that the car would he more
disgusted with the harshness of the verse, if the right
accent were preserved, than with a wrong accent which
preserves the harmony of the verse: for it is not mere-
ly reducing a line to prose if the sense requires it, which
is a capital fault in reading poetry, but reducing it to
very harsh and disagreeable prose. Thus the Angel,
in Milton, reasoning with Adam about the planets,
says,

For such vast room in nature nnpossessed
By living souls, desert and desolate,
Only to shine yet scarce to contribute
Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far
Dmsdn to this hahitahle, which returns

Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
Pamd. Lost, B. viii. 22. 

54 Ahd hpxteanxsc.

The word contribute has properly the accent on the
second syllable; but the verse would be so harsh with
this accent, that a good reader will, for the sake of
sound, lay the principal accent on the ﬁrst syllable, and
a subordinate stress on the third. The same may be
observed of the word attribute, in the following passage
from the same author:

The swiftncss of those circles attribute,
'l:ltough IH.lml)£’l‘lt353, to his omnipotence.
'1 hat to corporeal sulrstanccs could add
Speed almost spiritttal. Ibirl. B. viii. r. 197.
But when the poet has with great jturlgment contriv-
ed that his numbers slmll be harsgh and gratixtg,it1 order
to correspond to the ideas they suggest, the common
accentuauon must be preserved.
On :1 .-mddctt open fly
With impetuotta recoil and jarritw sound

The infernal doors, and on tlteir hinges grate
Hm‘.-~l1 thunder. (bid. B. ti. r. SW.

Here the ltarslmess arising from the accent on the

second syllable of the \\'Ol‘(l impetuous, ﬁnely expresses
the recoil and jarring sound of the gates of hell.

INFLECTIONS on THE VOICE. 65

In the example from Milton, we have an instance that
the particle the may either l'orm n distinct syllable in
poetry or not; in the first line it must necessarily form
11 distinct syllable; in the second and last it may he so
blended with the succeeding word as to be pronounced
without elision, and yet form no distinct syllable.

RUIAE XLV. ./Ilrnost every verse admits 0 (L pause
in or near the middle of the line, which is cal ed the C(13-
snra; this nmst be carefully observed in reading verse,
or mnclt of the clistinctrtess, and almost all the harmony
will be lost.

EXAMI’l.PZ.

Nature to all tltlngs ﬁx'd the limits lit,

And tviseely cnrhctl proud untn’s pretending wit;

The solid power of tltltl¢‘.t'Sli.ttt(llItg fails;

\\'hm‘e hentne of wurnt intnginntion play

These lines have seldom any points inserted in the
middle, even by the ntost scrupulous punctuists; and
yet nothing can be more palpable to the em’, than that
a pause in the first at t/tings, in the second at curbed, in
the third at land, in the fourth at ports, and in the fifth
at soul, is ahsolttwly necessary to the harmony of these
lines ; and that the sixth, by atlmittittg no pause but at
unclorstamling, and the seventh, none hut at imagizuztion,
border very nearly upon prose. It is proper to ob-
serve, in this place, that though the most hnrmonious
place for the capital pause is after the fourth syllable, it
znny, for the sake of expressing the sense Sll‘t')t‘t§2,l}’ and
suitably, and sometimes even for the sake of variety, be
placed at several other intervals.

PREFACE.

"THE Elements of Elocution is a work, which has enjoy-
zed great reputation ‘both in England ‘and in this country.
‘The correctness of .its. principles is ,gene_rally~ admitted,
:and the rules it contains are allowed to be the most ‘accu-
rate guide we possess on the subject of Reading. It is
not however, in its present form, -well suited to the pur-
poses of a school book. The ‘volume is rather too expen-
sive for general use, and contains much which can neither
be applied nor understood by the majority of pupils. It

occurred to the compiler, that an abridgmexnt of this trea-

tise, divested of all minute disqu'isit~ion, and rendered
-strictly practical in its character, might be a useful manu-

al for schools. This idea has been conﬁrmed by some

intelligent friends whom he has consulted, and hence this
little volume is now offered to the public. '

The alterations which have been attempted in the pre-
>sent.compendiun,1, as will be noticed on comparing it with
the original work, are not numerous. They consist in
occasionally varying the order of the Rules, in simplifying
their language, and in supplying a few additional exam-
ples for practice. Where these changes occur, it is hoped
their utility will appear suﬁicient to justify their intro-
.duction.

Inspired repulsed battalions-—-to _ engage,
And taught the doubtful battle—-where to rage.
Know, then, thyself—-presume not God to scan ;
The proper study of mankind--is man.
RULE XLVI. ./flt the end of every line in poetry
must be a pause proportioned to the intimate or remote
conneanon between it and the following line. i

There is a natural tendency in reading poetry to
pause at the termination of each linegand provided
such pause is consistent with the sense of the passage,
this propensity may safely beindulged. Hence a pause
is often proper in poetry, where it would be omitted in
prose as unnecessary :

EXAMPLE.

’Tis with our judgments as our watches; none

Go just alike, yet each believes his own.
Here a slight pause is admissible at none, since such a
pause does not interfere with the sense. Where, how-
ever, the sense is such. as would render -two words in-
separable in prose, they are equally so in poetry.

EXAMPLE.

Which, without passing through the judgment, gains

The heart, and all its endat once attains.
Here the verb gains is so intimately connectedwith its
object, that a pause between them would be 1i1Jt1I'10'.1S :

such agpause is therefore inadmissible. See remark
under Rule II.

RULE XLVII. In order to form atcadence in C6 pe-
riod in rhyming verse, we must adopt the falling inﬁec-
tion with considerable force, in the ccesnm of the last
line but one.

EXAMPLE. .

One science only will one genius ﬁt,

So vast is art, so narrow human wit ;

Not only bounded‘ to peculiar arts,

But oft in those conﬁned to single parts ;

Like kings we lose the conquests gained before,
By vain ambition still to make them more ;

Each might his several priivince [| well command,
Would all but stoop to what they understand.

rNrLECT1oNs or THE VOICE; 67

in repeating these lines, we shall ﬁnd it necessary to
‘form the cadence, by giving the falling inflection with a
little more force than common to the word province.
The same may be observed of the word pro.s10ect, in
the last line but one of the following» passage:

So pleased at first the towering Alps we try,
Mount o’er the Vales, and seem to tread the sky;
‘Th’ eternal snows appear already past,

And the first clouds and mountains seem the last;

But. thcisefltlained, we tremble to survey

The growilig; labours of the lengthened way;

The increasing prospect |] tires our wandering eyes,
7 Hills peep o’er hills, and Alps on Alps arise.

RULE XLVHI.  simile in poetry ought always to
he read irza lower tone of voice than that part of the
passage which precedes it.

EXAMPLE;

’Twas -then great Marlborouglfs mighty soul was proved,

That in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,

Amidst confusion, horror, ace‘ despair,

Examined all the dreaa’i'ul scenes of war.

In peaceful thought the ﬁeld of death surveyed,

To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid ;

Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,

And taught the do'uhtfn.i battle where to rage,

So when an angel, by divine command

With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,

(Such as of late o’er pale Britannia past,)

Calm and serene he dr.‘-_ves the furious blast;

And, pleased th’ Almigh‘=;y’s orders to perform,

Rides on the whirlwind, and directs the storm. ﬂddison.

RLTLE XLEX, l/Vhere there is no pause in the sense
at the end of the verse, the last ward must have exactly
the same inﬂectwn it would have in prose.

At his command th’ uprooted hills retired
Each to his place ; they heard his Voice and Went
Obsequious ; heaven his wonted face renewed,
And with fresh ﬂowerets hill and valley smiled.

in this example, the words retired and went require
the rising inflection; since this is the inflection they
would have were the sentence pronounced prosaically.

RULE L. Sublime, grand, and inagmﬁcent descrip-=

tien in _poetry, jregttently regal/‘es a lower tone of voices

68 ART on READING.

and (Z tsameqtess nearly approaching to a monotone, to
give it ocmety.

This rule will surprise many who have always been
taught to look upon a monotone or sameness of voice
as a deformity in reading. A deformity it certainly is,
when it arises either from a “want of power to alter the
voice, or a want of judgment to introduce itaproperly;
but when it is introduced with propriety, it is one of
the greatest embellishments of poetic pronunciation.
Nay, a monotone connected with preceding and suc-
ceeding inﬂections, is a real variety, and is exactly sim-
ilar to a succession of the same identical notes in mu-
sic; which, considered a‘paft',i' is perfectly monotonous,
but taken with what goes before and follows, is among
the finest beauties of composition.

EXAMPLE.

Hence ! loathed Melancholy,
Of Cerberus, and blackest Midnight born,
In Stygian cave forlorn,
’Mongst horrid shapes and shrieks, and sights unholy.
Find oat some uncouth cell,
Where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings,
And the night raven sings;
There, under‘ ebon shades and low‘-browed rocks,
As ragged as thy looks,
In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell. Milton.

In repeating this passage, we shall ﬁnd the darkness

and horror of the cell wonderfully augmented, by pro-
nouncing the eighth line,

“ There, under ebon shades, and low-brewed rocks,” _ ’

in a low monotone; which monotone may not be im-
properly signiﬁed, by the horizontal line generally used
to mark long quantity; as this line is perfectly descrip-
tive of a sameness of tone, as the acute and grave ac-
cent are of variety.

ART OF READING.

TUE Art of Rearling is that system of roles, which
teaches to prnnounre written composition with justness,
energy, variety, and force.

The first object of every one who reads to others,
is to be perfectly heard by those wltom he ttrltlresses.
For this purpose, three things are especially necessary.
First, a proper loudness of the voice. This must be
proportioned to the space which is to be filled, and the
number of persons present. Second, a due tlegree of
slotrncss. Third, perfect distinctness of articulation.
An attention to tltese three circumstances is the foun-
dation of all good reading.

P.t4lUSES.

The next important object of attention in reading, is
the due arratigetnent of pauses. This will be the sub-
ject of the following rules. i

Rum: I. The primﬁpal pause in every sentence 09-
curs at the end, where it is always rtecemtry to susperfll
the voice, before beginning a new sentence.

This is the first and most obvious Rule for pausing.
As each sentence may be considered a complete pro-
position by itself, it is plain, that in order to distinguish
it perfectly from that which follows, a certain interval
must separate them. The place where this should
occur is, of course, denoted by the period. its dura-
tion is varied in some measure by the length of the

pi
