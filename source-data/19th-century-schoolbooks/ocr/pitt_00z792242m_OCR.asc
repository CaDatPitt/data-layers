gentler feelings of home associations witn the sterner calls
of duty. But tact is no less wanting under these circurnm
stances. Who would write to a child at school, to a friend
just married, or to a dignitary of the church, all in the samc
terms? One may be familiar with all three.
And even on the most famrniliar occasions, and in addres
ing the most familiar friends, this tact will aid us in not a
few material points. It will prevent us mistaking boisterous
familiarity (and, too often, slang( and vulgarity) for heartiness-carelessness in grammar for freedom of style (a mistake, unhappily, not confined to letter-writers only), and
will give a refinement and gracefulness which enhance even
the most tender passages of love and friendship.
Now it is candidly to be confessed that the art of acquiring this fact, (which is little else than the whole art of
letter-writing,) is one of time, trouble, and difficulty. The
earlier it be commenced, the better; but there are many,
whose acquaintance withi the world at large begins late in
life-perhaps never begins at all, and from such persons
much cannot be expected. A regular correspondence with
those who themselves write well is unquestionably the surest
means of attaining this end, and, next to it, the frequent
perusal of such letters as form a part-and a charming
part-of the writings of our best authors. To those who
possess the opportunity of cultivating both or either of
those resources, the examples contained in the following
pages can teach little, excepting, perhaps, the art of saying
plain things in plain words, and being able to say no more
than is necessary upon a trifling subject-a matter which a
great many very clever people find more difficult than they
are willing to confess.
As to letters on courtship, matrimony, and such like
matters, the editor candidly confesses that he should feel little sympathy with any gentleman who received a printed
circular in answer to an address taken from a printed letter.
Had he consulted his own inclinations, he would probably
have excluded any attempts to deal with such matters (where
befitting writing cen only spring from the deepest recesses
of the human heart); but, in deference to custom, he has
prepared some specimens, and selected a few others, which
he trusts will, at all events, not lead his readers to any of
the displays of folly or misplaced romance, which too froquently form painfully-ludicrous episodes in the earlier s

quamintance of the two sexes. A manly and honorable feeling towards the objects of our affections will, it is to be
hoped, always suffice to prompt its honest expression, wthout running into bomubast, extravagant adulation, or unreasonable and absurd protestations.
Howsoever humble, or elevated, there is no situation of
life in which the "art of letter-writing" must not occasionally be found of vast importance. rTo the poor, it is a comfort, a solace, a blessing; with the middle and higher classes
of society, it is an indispensable acquirement-an exhaustless source of enjoyment and pleasure. It ought to be regarded as an essential part of education. But, like other
arts, it must be taught, or studied; for, whatever may be
the scholastic advantages of the individual, it can rarely,
if ever, be possessed by intuition.
Do you feel puzzled when you sit down to write a letter?
Are you in a fix how to begin? Would you rather walk a
mile to tell your friend what you have to say, than spend
half a day in writing to him or her? Do you postpone the
writing of a letter because it is "such a bother" until the
occasion for writing has gone by, or the patience of your
friend is exhausted, or you yourself "ashamed of having put
it off so long?" Attend a while, and you shall endure these
pains no more-you shall no longer suffer headache or cramp
in the wrist, nor the loss of a day in accomplishing what
may be done in a quarter of an hour, nor the worry and
vexation of not knowing how to begin, or, having begun,
how to go on, or how to leave off; nor the danger of breaking faith with the best of friends because, although you
would if you could, yet you cannot, cannot write a letter.
Can you write a letter without hesitation, demur, or difficulty? Can you seize the pen, and, at once, commit your
thoughts to paper as freely as you could speak them, stating
your business proposals, your friendly assurances, your gratulations, your condolence, your love; or, in the formal language of reserved politeness, convey your acceptance or
refusal of an invitation or a present, or your simple notification or acknowledgement of a fact? If you can do this you
want none of our advices, and we assure you at starting
that we do not believe we have a single hint to offer youtherefore, if you read on it is at your own peril, not ours.
But we do offer help to those who really want it-and their
name is legion. Persons who are not accustomed to the weCHESTERFIELD'S LETTER-WRITER.
of the pen find it a tough task to write a letter, and the
difficulty is the greater in proportion to the insufficiency of
tneir education. Many, even among sensible and wellinformed people, are but poor hands at letter-writing, or
even in the diction of a simple note, and they wonder how
in the world it is that others of no better education than
themselves are so ready in the use of the pen, so little embarrassed in the composition of sensible and even long letters. so happy in their expressions, so clear in their statements, their sentences so brief, so well arranged, and the
whole tone of their correspondence characterized by good
sense, good feeling, and true politeness. It seems as if there
were a mystery about it which only a gifted few can understand; whereas there is no mystery whatever; comparatively speaking, nothing to be learnt; for whosoever can manage
to scrawl with a pen, and spell the words in common use,
might, with the exercise of a little patient perseverance,
write down their thoughts as easily as they can speak
them.
But, says the reader," This is not exactly true; for I have
ersevered for years, my hand-writing is really respectable,
can spell correctly, and I know something of grammar,
and yet it costs me much labor to write a letter, and, after
all, J seldom write one that pleases me, and (in confidence) I
assure yoa, I frequently write half a dozen, and say the same
thing in half a dozen different ways, and then destroy them
all because there is not one that I consider fit for the occasion." What of that? The most accomplished scholar
that ever lived, the most finished inditer of a model letter,
found a little difficulty at first, and no literary man ever acquired the free andready. use of the pen without some stumblings at starting, and you have only to persevere in the
right direction, to attain excellence in this necessary, useful,
and ornamental accomplishment.
A well-written letter has opened the way to prosperity for
many a one, has led to many a happy marriage and constant
friendship, and has secured many a good service in time of
need; for it is in some measure a photograph of the writer
and may inspire love or hatred, regard or aversion, in the
reader, just as the glimpse of a portrait often determines us
in our estimate of the worth of the person represented.
Therefore, one of the roads to fortune runs through the inkbottle, and if we want to attain a certain end in lowe, frieud

ship, or business, we must trace out the route correctly with
the pen in our own hand.
Let us take the geaeral case of letter-writing as practised
by uneducated persons. Whatever be the subject of the
letter on the occasion of writing, it is pretty sure to begin
thus:
"This comes hopping to find you all well, as it leaves us at
present, thank God for it."
In the next letter the writer varies the commencement for
the sake of change, and begins:
" I take up my pen to write you these few lines."
By-and-by the writer begins to suspect that such a mode
of beginning a letter is not very elegant, and eighteei cents
are expended on that very remarkable work, "The Lady's and
Gentleman's Complete Letter Writer, 90th edition." The
time comes for another letter; the" Complete Letter Writer"
is dragged out from the darkness of the drawer in which it
had hoped to conceal itself for ever, and an hour is spent in
the search for a model letter that will just express the writer's feelings and ideas. But, alas! among the three hundred
and forty-seven specimens of every style of correspondence,
there is not one in which James is politely requested not to
forget the boots, or Eliza is reminded that Walter still hopes
to meet her, with sentiments unchanged, when next she visits
New York; there is nothing in the "domestic letters" to
meet the case of baby's teeth, or Susan's blistering, or Jeremiah's illness and recovery, or the death of Mrs. Jones.
The "business letters" say not a word about the administration of Jones's will, they do not even mention the apprenticeship of young Waggles. As to the "love letters," the
writer thereof has made no provision for Jemima's acceptance of Joseph on condition that he will at once shave off
his moustache, and take to all-round collars, and give up
punning at the dinner-table. The " complimentary letters"
are certainly very pretty, but they don't help one to present
compliments to Mrs. Popejohn, and thank her for her kind
present of a green cat, and a pair of turtle doves. No;
nor when the general form of any letter or note does happen
to suit, can the copyist determine how or where to work in
a little special request, or remark. or question. or. in fact, to
ake a respectable statement of any kind, save and except
ICHESTERFIELD'S LETTER-WITrR.
what is actually printed; and for this good reason-that a
printed letter saves the writer the trouble of thinking; and
self-dependence, confidence, easy expression of ideas, are, of
course, in any such case impossible.
The fact is, a complete letter writer is a complete sLam,
an absurdity. People want to write letters "out of their
own heads," and it is impossible to give them "ready made"
letters, which, like ready made shirts, shall fit every subject
that may require clothing. We know a case of a gentleman
-at least, a person-who offered his hand to a lady with tllhe
help of a letter writer. The letter began," Reverend Miss;"
how it finished the reader need not be told, but, of course
the lover was rejected, and his "billy dux" went into the
lady's museum of curious autographs. Perhaps he should
have copied it" Revered Miss," but he should not have copied
at all. Had he written what he really felt, in the best language he could command, he might have gained a hearinlg,
and, perhaps, a bride; but he went to a dead sepulbchre of
words instead of speaking from his living heart, and deserved
the snubbing for his pains. The first step, then, towards
attaining the art of letter-writing is, to tear up the "Complete Letter Writer" into pipe-lights, or curl-papers; at all
events, it must be got out of sight, and you must begin de
novo, that is, out of your own head.
You want to write a letter, then, and you are puzzled how
to begin. Will you write sentences on bits of paper,
and accumulate them till you have a heap, then sort and
arrange them, copy them out at length, and then correct
and copy the whole? Nothing of the sort; yet this is the
way some people'write letters. We know a case of a lady
who broke off an engagement with a gentleman, and who
had occasion to return him a book which she had borrowed.
She wrote an indignant letter, composed bit by bit till she
had about half a peck of little sentences. When she came
to copy them out the greater part were of a most objectionable kind; some, she remembered afterwards, were very bold,
nay, insulting, in tone. But she managed to make up what
she thought a very proper letter, and, by some strange muddle, gave him both book and letter with her own hands.
But, alas I she had no sooner parted from him than she remembered she had tucked the half-peck of disjointed sentences inside the book, so that he not only had the letter. hul

the corrupt pieces out of which it had been made. She
hoped nrever to meet him again-let us hope she never did
though he might have found her a sadder but a wiser
woman.
When you sit down to write a letter, think of
your subject-of the circumstances you wish to state.
On a spare piece of paper put down your loose ideas,
your various points promiscuously as they occur. For
instance, I will suppose that you have a dozen different
heads, more or less, onl which you desire to expatiate. Put
them all down, (leaving a little margin on the left hand side
of your paper,) no matter in what order, one after anotlier,
as they occur; a single word will in most cases suffice to
lead your memnory. Having proceeded so far, consider in
what manner, in what order, the different heads of your
letter may be arranged. so as to produce a harmonious and(
effective whole, and number them in the margin accordingly,
1, 2, 3, &amp;e. There are three modes by which your task may
be successfully accomplished; the mode to be determined oby
circumstances, aid by your own taste and judgement.
First.-Suppose that you have numbered your subjects
according to their intrinsic importance, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., and that
you wish to treat of them in that order, commencing with No.
1. By this means you will first state your most important
point, and then gradually: descend, numerically, and close
with No. 12, the least significant in the series. To this
mode, unless for short letters, there is an objection; yQur
letter incurs the risk of becoming tame, feeble and unimpressive at the close.
Second.-Number your subjects inversely; that is, let
your first head, No. 1, be of the slighltest consideration in
the series; No. 2 will powess an interest somewhat higher;
No. 3 will become still ilore interesting; your letter will
thus grow upon the attention of the reader as he proceeds;
and, by reserving the most important point till the last, it
will terminate with a strong and impressive climax.
Third.-For long letters, or for letters embracing a great
variety of subjects, this will generally be found the most
preferable; but still as I have said, the mode must be de.
termined by circumstances, and by the taste and judgement
of the writer. Adopt, first the dqcendinz, and then the
910           t0HERS1sUILD'8 LETTER-WRITER.
ascending scale; from superor to inferior, and then from
tre'-;or to superior; something like this:
12
1           11
2         10
3      9
4    8
5 7
6
That is, commence with No. 1, as an important point,
though of less importance than No. 12; thus descend min the
importance of the respective points till you reach the bottom
of the scale, No. 6; after which you may ascend from the
comparatively insignificant point, No. 6, till you gradually
reach the most important point of all, No. 12. Or you may
number your subjects in a double series, according to the
modes, First and Second, thus:
Superior 1         1   Inferior
2        2
3        3
4        4
5        o
Inferior 6        6   Superior.
By these means the commencement of your letter will be
ood, and its termination will be better; and calculated to
leave a clear and strong impression on the mind of the
reader.
You want to begin your letter, and it is to be a letter to a
friend. Now just consider for 4, moment what you would
say to that friend if he or she were present. The moment you
hlave abstracted yourself, the first words of greeting will
pass through your mind, then the inquiries, and your friend's
responses. Quietly take a pen and write down those nimagined
words. But the moment you take a pen the words are gone,
and your mind is as barren as ever; that is because you are
trying to say something grand, to " write like a book," or
like somebody else whose letters you like. Never mind how
sentences are made in books, or how somebody else begins
such pretty letters. Write as you would sveak. write on tillA FAMILIAR LETTER.
you have written all you would speak, as far as the compass
of a letter will enable you, and you will be surprised to find
that you have explained yourself in a straightforward way,
and with a feeling of g(rrace that does you credit.
We beg you to depend wholly upon yourself, to write
down your simple thoughts as they occur to you, and to state
your requests, your replies, your sympathies and suggestions,
just as if your friend were beside you, and you were talking.-s friends do talk. For instance, a young man is about to
write to his absent brother, and he begins, "Dear Thomas."
Then he is stuck fast, and he thinks of sending his letter
"hopping to find brother Thomas well."  Then the great
event which he is to relate thoroughly puzzles him, and, at
last, he writes "mother and father send their loves, and
mother has been confined, and the baby is a girl, and its to
be named Eliza."
But if he would imagine himself talking to brother
Thomas he would write in this wise:
"Dear Tom"As we have not received any unpleasant news from you, we
feel assured that, you are hearty and prospering. But if you
are at all pinched in pocket, or out of health, don't hesitate to
let us know, for we are anxiously concerned about your pro
gress, and father would remit you a few dollars rather than
that you should suffer inconvenience from scarcity of cash.
" You know what a quiet life we live, and can well imagine
how excited the village has been lately, when I tell you that
there is an addition to the family here-a thumping sister for
you, Tom, born at twelve, orl Tuesday night last, and' mother
and child doingwell.' The nurse, old Hatchet--you rememnber
her-says she is the fipest baby she ever saw. She certainly i8
a fine child; but, upon my soul, she makes a horrid noise all
niight. I'm glad that my bed-room is at the top of the house,
and I can patiently bear with the moaning of the pigeons when
I reflect on the sort of serenades I should have if I slept in
the room you had."
Of course, we might go on and ccmpose a very long letter
1o brother Tom; but as it is impossible to invent a letter of
any kind, suitable to more than one case in ten thousand;
so it is absurd to invent incidents or imagine feelings, in the
expectation that some lucky chance will make them suitable
ti any one about to write a letter  Our object is to impress
11CHESTERFIELD S LETTER-WRITER.
upon the beginner the necessity of writing what he or she
may really think and feel, and to abandon all intention of
producing an effect by fine writing, or bard words. That
which you say directly from yourself will most forcibly
appeal to the reader of your letter; and whatever the object
of the letter--a mere interchange of friendship, a declaration of love, or a business proposition-it will be more
readily attained by a letter written off-hand, than by one
which may cost you a whole night of study, even if you
nibble the pen into pulp, and spoil a quire of paper.
But if your letter, when so written, has an awkward look,
go over it carefully, and strike out every word that seems
superfluous. In this suicidal sort of task you will have to
slaughter adjectives wholesale. Adjectives, mny dear reader,
are those words which express the qualities of things, and
inexperienced writers are generally addicted to an excessive
use of them. An extraordinary incident, a remarkable fact,
a very strange and wonderful occurrence, a magnificent
and splendid appearance, and so on, are to be regarded as
excrescences which you must prune off, however fine they
look for the moment. Run your pen throughl every word
that can be spared, no matter how small the word mnay be;
erase whole sentences if they are not strictly essential to
convey your meaning; and when you have reduced the compass of your letter, you will remember something which you
ought to have said, but which escaped you while writing;
add any such omitted matters, and copy the whole out as
clearly as you can, and you will be pleased withl the new
form of your letter, thllough you may have endured many
pangs in erasing some portions of the original.
Let us have an example to help us. You write in the first
instance, thus:
" I did not receive yours of the 18th till this morning, so
that it has been six days detained by the post, which is very
inconvenient, as the letter might have been of much more importance; and in that case you might have thought me neglient in not replying earlier, which I could not do of course,
because I had not received the letter. I am glad to hear that
your health continues so good, and I hope it will do so, and I
dare say it will, for the air is good and the situation high where
you are now living, and. by this time, I should think, very pleasant. It gave me very great pain, and much sorrow to hear of
the sad news of your ni ece's (continled illness, especially as I

ave so much regard for her, and remember, as I shall always
do, the very pleasant and agreeable mornings we used to spend
together in walking over those remarkable ruins, where there
are so many extraordinary beauties of scenery, and so much to
interest the miind, in the contemnplation of magnificent scenery
and wonderful prospects at the Abbey. I am sure you will
believe me very thankful for your kinrd offer which you state in
your letter; but as I amn so much engaged at home. and have to
see to Harry's business when he is away on market-days, I
cannot accept it, though I can assure you that I should be most
happy to do so if circumstances permitted, and I could see
clearly that I should be able to stay; because such an engagement is not of much use unless one can keep it for some time at
least, and if I took it I should like to stay a year or two."
Perhaps, when you have got so far you may halt to take
breath, and find your space exhausted; and then some imortant matter, which you had nearly forgotten, will have to
be scribbled round the edges of the letter, as a sort of
framework, being, perhaps, of more importance than the
picture. Just write out this additional matter in a paragraph, and then go over the whole and see what you can
cut out. You will find that you have wasted a great space
in apologizing for not having replied earlier, in consequence
of the delay of the post. You have been very diffuse about
your correspondent's health, and still more so on the few
matters that follow, but yet you cannot see where to spare a
portion; but if you imagine that you were called upon to
relate in a few words the contents of your letter, you would
soon find that it might be condensed into a neat shape
thus:
"Yours of the 18th did not arrive here till this morning, and
the delay will excuse any apparent negligence on my part, in
not replying earlier. I hear with much pleasure of your continued good health, which I sincerely hope will continue; the
purity of the air and elevation of the position are, I think, very
imuch in your favor. It gives me much sorrow to hear of the
continued illness of your niece, the more so that I remember
with pleasure the agreeable mornings we used to spend together
among the interesting ruins and chamnning scenery of the
Abbey.
" The proposal you make me I highly appreciate, and would
at once accept, were I not very much engaged at home. Let
me, therefore, decline, with sincere thanks, the engagemet
you so kindly offer."

When you have thus reduced the bulk and improved thie
style of your letter, you will find room for the additional
matters that you were at first compelled to thrust into an
ugly postscrit.
In all cases you must guard against diffuseness, you must
oe plain and brief, and you will soon find that half a dozen
words will usually convey your meaning more clearly and
more elegantly than half a dozen sen tences. But brevity
must never be cultivated to such an extent as to merge into
abruptness, for abruptness and rudeness are near neighbors,
and a moderate freedom of expression is always preferable
to immoderate condensation. There is a story told of a
gallant, who wrote to a noted general the following briet
epistle:
To General  --
"Sally has accepted me; can I have her?
"Yours, --.'
Tro which the General replied:
"Go ahead,
"Yours,.
Another important matter to be borne in mind is, to go a*
straight to your subject as possible. Do not circumvent, ok
play a game of round-about, but plainly say what you mean.
as if you were expressing yourself in the simplest conversa
tion. Here is a bit of circumventing fearful to behold:
"Sir,

but in consequence of the very great dullness of trade, and the
difficulty of getting moneys in at this dead season of the year.
and the few orders that I get, and most of them from custom.

money trade is that which I most want; together with the late
failure of the Messrs. Brassey, which occurred on the 10th vf
lasit month, and in consequence of which the Branch Bank
stopped payment on the following day, and a small balance
which I had there is lost, or at least I shall only get a small
dividend, and that not at present; and some orders which I
bad from the essers. Brassey were countermanded; and if
they had not bee countermanded I could not have gone on
with them; besides which, I had a small account against thew
which they had promised to settle mmediately, and in conse
4DON'T BE VERBOSE.
quence of their fAilure I shall have to take my chatice with the
other creditors, and shall get, I fear, but a very small dividend;
so that all my transactions with that firm have been a loss to
me. If you could advance me another hundred dellars, on my
bond, for three months, I should esteem it a great favor, and
would make such good use of the money, in completing orders
which I have in hand, and which I cannot go on with for want ox
eash, but which if completed, will be very profitable, and enable me to discharge my obligations to you, and to inscribe
myself, your very obedient and humble servant,
"JONAS SLOWCOACH."
Now, this request of our friend might be compressed into
a few modest words, and a respectful appeal made, which
would be more likely to secure him the loan he wants than
the long-winded statement he herein inflicts upon his patron.
No sensible man would care to lend any one so much money
after reading such a letter; it is worth all the money to
wade through it. But if Jonas would " re-word the matter,"
and give the whole a decent shape, he might stand a good
chance of having his request granted. Let him go straight
to the point, and his patron will see at once that he is dealing with a man of decision, who preserves a proper selfrespect and independence even when asking a favor.
"Sir,
" I regret that I should have again to tax your kiidness, but
I am under the necessity of requesting you to advance me another hundred dollars to enable me to complete some orders of
a profitable kind, for which ready money is indispensable. 1
should not have had to trouble you had not the recent failure ot
Messrs. Brassey entailed upon me some heavy losses, which the
orders I have in hand will enable me to some extent to repair.
Messrs. Brassey's failure was announced on the 10th of last
month, and on the following day the Branch Bank stopped
payment, and a balance of cash which I&amp;ad there was renderedl
unavailable, and will possibly be lost. Besides this misfortune,
the Messrs. Brassey owed me an account at the moment of
their.failure, and I shall now have to take my chance
of a dividend with the other creditors.  Trade is very
dull," &amp;e. &amp;c.
Onie great cause of tediousness in letters is, the practice
adopted by writers of interlarding their sentences with parenthfeses, so that the thread of sense pursiies a tortuous course,
and we are engulfed in the serpentine most completely.
15C IESTERFIITLD'S LETTER-WRITIR.
"John says (and I dare say he is right) that (had he known
it before) he would (had not the weather prevented him, and
au illness from which he was then suffering, and from which
be is only just recovering, though Dr. Emetic told him he
could not be about for six weeks) have gone over to the
marshes (only that the frost was so severe, and his pony was
laid up at the farrier's with a tooth-ache, and besides he could
not face the east wind), and he would have bought the sheep
at once.'  
Just imagine that your pen is an arrow or javelin, and
that it is to be hurled directly to some chosen mark, and
you will soon acquire the art of plain speaking, without
parenthesis, or twaddle, much to your own rejoicing and your
ceader's relief.
Some ludicrous effects are sometimes produced in letters,
by the neglect of the writer to pay attention to the antecedent. That is to say, you must write the present line in accordance with what has gone before, and nlot mix your
sentences together, so that it shall be difficult to understand to
what any particular remark is intended to apply. Thus we
read an advertisement in a New-York paper, announcing that
a blue gentleman's cloak was lost at the railroad depot, and
any person giving information of iA, or if stolen, the convicted person, shall receive five dollars reward. But to make
it intelligible, regard must be paid to the antecedents, namely, blue is the antecedent of gentlemnan, but applies to the
cloak, not to the gentleman, and we must therefore say,
" gentleman's blue cloak." And again, as to the reward, it
is not to be paid to the thief, but to the informer, and we
must say, "a reward of five dollars shall be paid to any person who shall give such information as shlall lead to its recovery, or if stolen, to the conviction of the thief."
Yet blunders of this kind are very common in thie letters
of uneducated persons. Mr. Bonsor will write to a wholesale house requesting " another parcel of the patent hooks
and eyes, and a few razor cases, sixty to the ounce." "Sixty
to the ounce," occurred to him after he had written "razor
cases," and applies to the " parcel of hooks and eyes," not,
certainly, to the "razor cases."
By avoiding long sentences, and summing up every statement or remark in one or two short ones, you will soon attain to elegance of composition, and from the first you will
be sure to make yourself understood, and that is tlhe i ne
fi1)ON'T BE VERBOSE.
cessity ot any communication whatever. Depend upon it,
as soon as you begin wire-drawing, you are getting cloudy
and ungrammatical; and if your letter wants remodeling
or copying, the long sentences will puzzle you into a low
fever, and if an error occurs anywhere, even if you detect it,
it will be very difficult to remedy it in any sentence that
runs on to an immoderate length. But you must not make
your sentences so short that they express only parts of ideas
or facts; as for instance:
"It rained. So I rode. But it soon cleared up. And remained bright. So I got out at Broadway. And walked the
remainder of the way."
Though such a statement may be cut up into many short
sentences, it really consists of but two, because there are but
two incidents to relate.
"It rained, so I rode. But as it cleared up, and remained
fine, I got out at Broadway, and walked the remainder of the
way."
In composition of every kind, a grammatical construction
of sentences is essential, not merely for the sake of accuracy,
but for elegance and clearness. The writer of an ungrammatical letter must risk being pitied, or laughed at, or sneered at, according as the reader may be influenced in the perusal of the letter. Yet, though grammatical accuracy is so
desirable, it does not follow that a person cannot write a
respectable letter withlout first going through a course of
grammar. As we can only here advise you to make yourself as competent as possible in that useful department of
knowledge, it remains with yourself to pursue it or not, according to your inclinations; but the plain confesion must
be made, that, without a sound knowledge of grammar, the
writer of a letter can never rise above mediocrity.
In the absence of such knowledge, we beg to impress upon
you the necessity of paying attentionto the members and genders of nouns and pronouns, and to the persons of verbs. Be
careful to avoid confounding the singular with the plural;
as, "These was mine, and they was his, but we changed, and
that's how I come to have them."
If you are in doubt in writing such a sentence, just reflect
how you make the same statement with the tongue, then
adopt the same for the pen, and your sentence will read.
i:CHRSTERFLF1LD'S LETTER-WRITEP
"Those were mine, and these were his, but we made an ex
change, and hence I came into possession of thme."
A little quiet reflection will often serve you well, even if
you are unacquainted with the rules of grammar.* You
might write, or in conversation say, " I was going along the
street, and whlo should I see but the fellow himself, and I
whispered to Jenkins,' That's-him.'"  Now, a little use of
the reasoning faculties will enable any one to detect the inaccuracy of this much-used phrase, "That's him;" for it is
evident at first sight that thlat is an impersonial pronoun, but
him is a personal pronoun, and hence they cannot be used in
conjunction. To say " That is the man," would be correct,
because we do not then use a personal noun or pronoun at
all. In the same way it would be incorrect to say, "I that
tell you this," because that, as already stated, cannot apply
to the pronoun I, and we say, " I who tell you this."
What are called demonstrative and relative pronouns
most frequently occasion difficulty to the uninitiated. This re.
fers to an object near the speaker, that to an object distant
from the speaker. These is the plural of this, and those is
the plural of that. They remain the same in every variation
of person, gender, or case. Hence we say," This man and
these boys whom you see here."
In reference to time, this is applied to the present, and
that to the past and future; as," T17his is an age of wonders,
that age was distinguished for its feats of arms--that time iv
not yet come."
Wo which, and that, are employed in relation to some
person or thing in a sentence, and the person or thing so referred to is called the antecedent; as " The man who spoke
to you produced the letters to which I refer, and amongst
them the one that I wrote."  A difficulty is sometimes experienced as to the respective uses of that and which.
lw and that may be employed with reference to the
three persons 1, thou, and he, in both singular and plural;
but which should be used only in reference to a noun in the
third person, singulaor plural.
But perhaps te  ord   as and were, which are parts of
the verb to be, are the least understood of any in our lan.

IsGRAMMATICAL BLUNDERS.,itage. An uneducated person will write or say, " If I w:s
going, and you was coming;" and sometimes those who have
noticed that educated persons use these words, somewhat peculiarly fly to another extreme, and say, "I were about to
say." When such an utterance is made before a grammarian, who has a slight love of the ludicrous, it has a tendency
to make him explode, so very comical is that were when so
placed.
Was belongs always to the singular number, and were to
the plural; as, I was, thou wast, he was, we were, you were,
they were.
The verb also takes the form of were in any conditional
case, so that whenever it is preceeded by if you will bear in
mind that was is a sign of vulgarity and ignorance. If I
were, if thou were, if he were, if we were, if you were, if they
were.
SPELLING.
Rules for spelling words cannot be given here, and the
dictionary must be your guide whenever you are in doubt.
To spell a word incorrectly is not always a proof of the
writer's incapacity; for, in the manuscripts of eminent scholars, instances of the kind frequently occur-the result, of
hurry and miadvertence. But there are some kinds of bad
spelling that enable us to distinguish between the carelessness of the scholar and the blundering of an ignorant writer; for instance, the confounding of the comparative as for
the past tense of the verb to have. Yet there is nothing
more easy of comprehension than the difference between
" He has the book, and it is bound in the same way as
yours." The first implies actioin-the action of possession;
the Second, comparison. How distinct and unmlstakeable,
and yet how often we see a neatly written letter, in which
the writer asks." as he told you so?" or, "as it happened?"
Words which have the double 1, or m, or n, are very common, and are frequently misspelt. Fortunately a very good
rr le can be given for the guidance of the letter writer. When
you are in doubt just pronounce the word aloud, and notice
where the accent falls, and place the double consonant indtead of the single one, if the accent falls on the syllable
preceding it. For instance: if the word befallen were pro.
nounced bef'alen it would be spelt with one 1; but as the
1930           CHESTERZFIELD S LETTER-WRITEl,.
accent falls on the second syllable-befalien--the double I
is correctly used.
We might fill a page with examples, but prefer to state
the rule only, and leave the reader to note the instances ip
the dictionary, or call them to mind by the aid of the memory. The rule is but little known, but is none the less
valuable on that account.
Words in which the compounds ie and ei occur, afford a
further instance of the necessity for a rule, and fortunately
-we can give ope: but its value will depend on the person's
accuracy of pronunciation.
In order to impress this rule on the reader's mind, we
must beg him or her to remember that whenever ei or ie occurs in German, the second vowel has its full vowel sound;
for instance, Liebig is pronounced Leebig, and Bleiter, B7i'ter; in each case the second of the twc vowels has its full
sound, and the first remains mute. Now, apply this to English words in ie and ei, and you have the kley at once to the
mode of spelling them. The word fiend is pronounced feend,
and hence you put the i first because it is mute. But neither and either are pronounced ni-ther and i-ther; and the
proper way to spell them, therefore, is to put the e first, the
e being mute. We believe that both these rules will prove
useful to many who are a little bit learned in literary matters, and as far as we know, they have not been given before. Our reading has not been limited, blt we have never
seen such rules laid down for spelling in the case of double
consonants, and the digraphs ei and ie.
CAPITaLS should be cautiously used in letter-writing. We
should certainly not confine the writer of a letter to the
rigid rule observed in printed literature, because an important word may sometimes be graced with a capital which, in
a printed form, would begin with a small letter. But an indiscriminate or even frequent use of capitals, is a proof of the
plebian origin and ignorance of the writer. The name of a
person or a place should always be commenced with a capitaI, and every fresh paragraph should commence with a capital; beyond this, there is little need for -their use-'strictly
speaking none..
RIt/c l ers are employed to distinguish the words of a foreign language that may be introduced into a sentence, or to denote that those of

paragraph should contain within it the complete relation of

of an incident, or a distinct statement of some kind, having
no relation to the statement which follows, and which lattes
will properly form another paragraph. Pay a little Attention to the manner in which paragraphs of books are arranged-this, for instance--and you will see that there is no

hurry on from one thing to another, from James's cold to

to weddings that are about to happen; and then to inquiries of all kinds, and replies to inquiries that have been addressed to them; and the whole of such separate and distinct
matters are strung together, sometimes without stops, but
very often indeed with no division into paragraphs. Yet
nothing can be more simple, for the matter readily separates
itself into portions, if it be carefully scanned, and it will
soon be discovered that this necessary and proper division
may be accomplished without the help of a professor, or a

" The marks used in punctuation are, thi commna (,) the micolon (;)
the colos (:), the period orfull point (.), the note of adm4raion (), and
the note of interrogation (ri).
"A comma, which is the shortest pause, is usedto separate those parts
of a sentet ce, which, though very closely connected In sense. require a
pause between them. Two or more substantives, adjectives, &amp;c., immediately succeeding each other, require a comma after each; as, She is
young, handsome, and agreeable; but, if connected by a conjunction,
the comma is not required; as, effe is a wise and learned mnn. When
an address is made to a person, the noun requires a comma before and
after it; as, Attend, child, to whvat Isay. Many adverbs require a comma
before and after them, as perhaps, howeveer, indeed, besides, &amp;c.
"A semnicoon is used for separating those members of a sentence
which require a longer pause than a comma, and need some other member
to render the sense complete; as, A clownish air is but a slight defect;
let, trefiing as it is, it is sufflcient to render a man diagreeable. Or
it is used to distinguish those members of a sentence, which, though less
closely connected than those separated by commas, are not so independent as those distinguished by a colon; as, The path of truth is a plais
and safe path; that of falsehood is a perpleang maze.
"A colon Is used when a member of a sentence is complete in itself
but Is followed by some additional remark or illustration; as, There is no
mortal trdyt wise and restless at the same time: wisdom is the repose
of minds. When several members of a sentence havy been distinguisheh
by semicolons, they require to be separated from the last clause by a
colon * as, Edcatwn is necessary to enlighten the mind  t ist of great
mportance rin the business of life; but it is indipens4mable for rising

mind is expressed; as,. O, virtue  how amiable thou art I
A note of interrogation Is placed at the end of every question; as,

u There are several other marks used in writing and printing which
require illustration. The dash --) Is used when the sentence is broken
off abruptly; as, To die-to sleep. The paresthesO ( ) is used to enclose
some part of a sentence which may be omitted withoutinjuring thesense;
as, We al (including Mr. A.) went to Boston. The apostrophe ['] is
used either as a sign of the possessive cese, or to shorten a word; as,
Mary's frock, thlw' for tosgh,  s'er for nver. The caret [A is used,
to show that some word or words are omitted; as, 1 am  a mas. The

Lawyers disdain punctuation in their documents, and
sholars will never cease to pity them so long as they
continue the practice of constructing documents without
stops. Are law clerks endowed with any greater power
of lungs than other people, or are they so clever in extemporaneous punctuation, that they can always mark the
pauses correctly in the perusal of documents? No, it is the
practice. or rather the habit, of the profession; the wors
then for the profession. Let no aspirant to elegance in epistolary correspondence disdain the services of those valuable
little dots, the comma, the semicolon, the colon, and the period. The comma and the period will do nearly all you
want; the dash may sometimes be useful; but the other
two require more experience to use them well. Wherever a
proper pause occurs, wherever the sentence seems naturally
to halt, stick in a comma; and when that head, or division,
or sentence, is really completed, put down your full-stop, ad
begin again with a capital letter. Observe how this is managed in books, and you will gain more instruction in punotuation in ten minutes than we could teach you were we to
devote several pages to the subject. Correct punctuation
not only gives elegance to a composition, but it makes its
meaning clear, enforces attention to those words or passages
which most require it, and to a great extent prevents a misunderstanding, or wilful misconstruction of the writer's
meaning.*
TO THOSE WHO WRITE FOR THE PRESS.
It would be a great favor to editors and printers, should
those who write for the press observe the following rules.
They are reasonable, and correspondents will regard them as
such: 1. Write with black ink, on white paper, wide
ruled. 2. Make the pages small, one fourth that of a foolscap sheet. 3. Leave the second page of each leaf blank.
4. Give to the written page an ample margin all round.
5. Number the papers in the order of their succession
6. Write in a plain bold hand, with less respect to beauty
7. Use no abbreviations which are not to appear in print.
8. Punctuate the manuscript as it should be printed. 9.
$ See an excellent little work entitled " MIND You SroPs,"' or "Puaetu
atdon made plain. " Published by Garrett, Dick and Fitzgerald, price 124
seats.
2324           CHESTERFIELD'S LETTER-WRITER.
For italics underscore one line, for small capitals, two;
capitals three. 10. Never interline without the caret to
show its place. 11. Take special pains with every letter in
proper names. 12. Review every word, to be sure that
none is illegible. 13. Put directions to the printer, at the
head of the first page. 14. Never write a private letter to
the editor on the printer's copy, but always on a separato
sheet.
THE COMPLIMENTARY NOTE
Has a distinct character, and can never be confounded with
the familiar epistle. The note style is to be adopted by persons who are strangers to each other, or not sufficiently
known to allow of a familiar style of correspondence. But
the subject has also much to do in determining whether the
letter or note form shall be adopted. Invitations of all
kinds may be conveyed in the form of the note; so may con.
gratulations, short requests, and compliments. But where
positive business of any kind is to be dealt with, the formal
business letter is preferable, except when a gentleman writes
to a lady who is a stranger to him, or a lady in writing to a
gentleman stranger; and even then the letter commencing
"Sir," ot "Madam," may frequently be the best.
It is a necessary character of a note that it should be
short, plain, and polite, but distant; as for instance:
" Mr. Brown presents his compliments to Miss Quaver, and
desiresto know if Miss Q. still continues to give lessons on the
guitar.
"Harmony House, June 10, 1856."
"Mrs. Sociable presents her compliments to Mr. and Mrs.
Gay, and will be happy to have their company for a friendly
dance, on the evening of Tuesday next, Dec. 18, at nine
precisely.
"The Snuggery, Dec. 12, 1856.'

has much pleasure in accepting for herself and Mr. Gay, Mrs.

"Makepeace Place, Dec. 13, 1856."
Now. why does Miss Quaver give more - information than
is sought of her? Simply because she is a shrewd woman.
anxious to extend her professional engagements, and so she
states her terms at once, and saves Mr. Brown the trouble
of writing again, and herself the trouble of a second
answer.
This form of correspondence does not admit of remarks
by the way, or even of prolix explanations, or rambling
statements and questions. Neither is it advisable as a form
of communication between very intimate friends; for after a
close friendship has been sealed by social communion, and
many acts of mutual regard, it would be in danger of sud.
den destruction by the appearance on the scene of so cold
a document. We must then adopt a warmer medium, ar4
say thus:
Hart Street, Nov. 9,1856.
"My Dear Miss Pink,
" We shall have a few friends here to dinner at five on
Friday next; will you kindly join us? If little Arabella
comes to town in time, bring her with you, and gladden tbe
heart of yours devotedly,        GEORGIANA PLUM."
One point we should scarcely have thought it necessary
to mention, had we not, while writing this, had a document
handed to us for inspection. We should call it a note "with
a vengeance," for it runs thus:
"Mr. Hawkins presents his compliments to Mr. Henry
Whittle, and I want to know if I can proceed with the draw
ings as you get the models ready. If Mr. Hawkins can make
progress with the scrolls first, perhaps you will oblige by intro.
ducing, as occasion serves, a few of the new floral borders,and
ublige, yours obedienTtly,            J. S. HAwKliws"
3
25f6          CHESTERVIELD'S LETTER-WItTER.
Now, whatever may be Mr. Hawkins's capabilities in
using the pencil, he certainly cuts a ludicrous figure when
he seizes the pen. But for this document, we should have
thought it unnecessary to inform the reader, that whatever
tone is assumed at starting, whether in a formal note a
friendly gossipy epistle, or a plain business letter, that saiae
tone should be sustained throughout, and more especially so
its grammatical form.
If we write," Dear Sir, I have had occasion," &amp;c., we
write in tlhefirst person singular; but when we say, "The
editor begs to inform Mr.," &amp;c., we write in the third
person singular. In the first case we say, I am, in the
latter, he is; and it is impossible to shift from one form to
another without at once violating the very fundamentals of
English syntax.
When you write a note you stand, as it were, behind the
scenes; you speak from a distance, and refer to yourself as
if you were a distinct personage, having no claim to I or
*ve. From that position you must not budge an inch, nor
must you attach a signature at the end of your note, but
state, after the fashion of the forms given above, and as
briefly and politely as possible, the object of your communicationL
Hence the uses of the note are restricted. It forbids you
to give a full account of any transaction, or to enter minutely into any details of trade or business, and more especially friendly inquiries, and chit-chat of any kind; it is complimentary, and may be friendly; but it must be formal,
elegant, brief, and so plain in its statement as to require no
explanation, or any further correspondence, beyond an
equally plain, polite, and elegant reply; and the reply must
be in the note form. To reply by means of a note in. the
first person, would evince a sad want of propriety, and a
proof of very ill breeding. As a rule, invitations of all
kinds should come from the mistress of the house.
THE FRIENDLY LET'TER.
But though a correspondence may commence in this way,
wd may even be so continued for complimentary purposes,
yet, as acquaintance ripens into friendship, the time will
osowe day come when such formal modes of correspondence
my be exchanged for others of a more familiar kintifE BUSINESS LETER.
Among men farmalities are soon got rid of, and especially
among men of literary culture, who yield to the genialities
of their own warm temperaments much sooner than those
who cultivate politeness only; for men of letters, and cultivators of the liberal and fine arts, have a happy way of
regarding each other as friends, even before personal acquaintance begins. In literary circles it is common enough
for a person to write to another a friendly and confidential
epistle, before the parties have ever seen each other; but
even then the value of the note in the third person would
not be overlooked, and such a letter would never be made
to do duty for it, and complimentary matters would still
have their proper formal mode of expression.
But, supposing an acquaintance to be commenced through
the cold medium of an invitation, a congratulation, or a
barren compliment, when may the parties abandon such a
form, and adopt one more congenial to their mutual regards
for each other, and the expression of the more enlarged commanion of feeling which may have sprung up between them?
Plainly, when they feel that they really understand each
olther, and are on terms of real acquaintance, if not of confidential friendship. Herein they must judge for themselves
but without haste, and cautiously.
Individual judgement, based on circumstances, is the only
guide in such a case, but is a guide which can never fail, if
there be a small amount of common sense to support it
When your heart yearns towards your friend, when you feel
that you have been too long separated by the demarkating line
of cold conventionality, sit you down and write to him-not
from the head, but from the heart; but keep a rein gently
tightened on your enthusiasm, for fear he should think you
are over-doing it. But you must still be a little complimentary till you know each other well; give him credit for
his good judgement, good taste, good feeling, or whatever of
his qualities strike you as forming a prominent part of his
character; and you may do this without being servile, without bespattering him with sickly flattery, without licking
the soles of his feet. Should you stoop to the latter, you
may expect to get kicked in rtturn; and yet a little gentlemwanly adulation, neatly done, and implied rather than said,
i. a great charm in friendly correspondence, and will be
pretty sure to bind your correspondent to you by very
enduring ties
21CHESTERFIELD'S LETTER-WRITER.
But you have opened your heart, and have said " My
dear Mr. Wilkins," instead of "Mr. Bumps presents his
compliments to Mr. Wilkins."
Will he reply in a kindred tone? He must. He dare not
send you back a cold note of six lines, written in the center
of an odoriferous sheet of the purest cream-laid. If you
get back a very polite note, distant as usual, the third per.
son responding to your assuring first, give it up, you are not
wanted; remain as an acquaintance if you please, but be
sure that in that quarter you have no friend.
Reverse the case, and all that applies to Wilkins applies
to yourself; and if you want to elbow aside an obsequious
flatterer, who thrusts his unwelcome eulogies, or his hollow
cordiality-perhaps with a future view to borrow-upon you
in an excessively pleasant way, settle him with an awfully
polite, short, and distant note, and he must be a fool, indeed,
if.he does not understand at once that "it won't do."
A friendly correspondence once established must not relapse into mere formalities, unless a decided quarrel and
separation have taken place. Small differences or disagTeements are never to make any change in your modes of
address and expression, for there is nothing meaner than the
severing of the obvious ties of friendship for trifles, though
such things do take place every day. It should be remembered that neither friendship, nor cordial acquaintanceship,
interfere in any way with a person's opinions or conduct, so
long as the universally recognised principles of honor and
morality are not violated. You may some day have to oppose your friend at a caucus meeting, or in a warm discussion on religion or politics; yet his aversion to your views,
and your impetuous opposition to his, are not to prevent
you writing, My dear Harry," or " My dear Tomkins," or
"My dear Sir," as you did before the difference broke out.
Depend upon it, there is nothing more contemptible than to
taint the amenities of social life with exhibitions of temper
or vexation, or to suffer the pen to express unfriendly sentiments or greetings of a suddenly cool charact(,r, because
some trifling difference has arisen between yourseit and your'riend.
Here it should be hinted that whatever mode you adopt
in addressing a person, is to be preserved in future correspondence, if not in exactly the same words, at least the same
lu purport; youInust not go back except for a special reason,

We remember an incidenit which may be mentioned in
illustration of this. A gentleman had been for many years
on terms of intimate friendship with his tailor, and the correspondence between them, whether of a friendly or a business nature, had always a cordial tone pervading it, until on
one occasion the friendship was sllghtly interrupted. In
fact, the gentleman was a little in arrear as to the settlement of his friend's account, and the latter sent a short and
brusque letter, as follows:
"Sir,
"I am disappointed in not having received the amount of
my bill as promised by you in your last: may I beg the favor
of a speedy settlemnent? Yours obediently,
"SIMON SLOWSTICH."
To this an atnswer was returned as follows:
My dear Slowstitch,
"Last time you wrote I owed you nothing, and you
addressed me as your' Dear Nonplus;' but since I have unfortunately failed to meet your demand, according to my own
promise, you reduce me to a mere'Sir,' upon your list of
patrons. Do you intend to terminate a friendship of tell years
in this way, or do you purpose resuming the' Dear Nonplus,'
with a view to be mine' faithfully,' when the account is settled
(as it will be to-morrow) remaining in the meanwhile mine
obediently,' only? Will you allow mne to suggest that expressions of friendship are open to question, both as to their value
and their sincerity, when they are made to depend on busiiess relations for their respective amounts of warmth or coldness which shall be infused into them. To be consistent, I
shall have to adopt a cringing tone when I owe' you money,
and a tone of pompous patronage the moment I have paid it;
that is, if any correspondence should continue between your.
gelf and yours very truly,      STEPHEN NONPLUS."
Among the forms of address for friendly, complimentary
and semi-business letters, we have the formal "Dear Sir" for
use on all occasions. The solicitor so addresses his client,
the client his solicitor, the patient his physician, the editor
his contributor, and, indeed, any man of gentlemanly pre
tentions, addressing another to whom he has already been
ititroduced, or with whom he has already corresponded. Io

correspondence of a professional nature, whetre both parties
are strangers, it would always be well to commence with
the simple " Sir," or "Madam," and in the second or third
letter adopt the more agreeable "Dtar Sir," or "Dear
Madam." A little enhancement of the gentlemanly or ladylike feeling is to be found in "My dear Sir," or "My dear
Madam," whidh may by degrees, as the parties know and
respect each other more sincerely, take the very friendly and
now fashionable form of "My dear Mr. Swallowwing," "My
dear Mrs. Pettitoe," or "My dear Miss Nightingale."  The
latter form is that most in use at the present day in polite
society, between persons who have met at least once, and
who are on terms of acquaintance, in which business has no
part whatever.
When folks begin to say " My dear Higginbottom," "My
dear old boy," and "My dear fellow," all strict rules of etiquette are at an end, and good sense gives a proper form to
the free expression of mutual friendship.
But friendship, like all other moral and material adornments of life, is subject to blight occasionally, and the
strongest union may be dissolved by a fiercer heat arising
from the combustion of the very dregs and lees of amity.
Your friend annoys you, disappoints you, breaks his word,
or lets off a bit of scandal that reaches your ears. Then
you will " writl him such a letter" you'll tell him plainly
what you think of him, and put him to shame by the evidence of black and white.
Now, if you are wise you will do nothing of the sort;
you will never write a single word that may cause shame or
pain in the reader's mind, or that the writer may have cause
hereafter to regret. A letter is a document that may be
preserved for ever; and should you be mistaken. or only
partially informed, or the victim of your own too hasty or
incompetent judgement, your own hand and seal may remain
as a witness of your rashness, perhaps of your meanness, t
the end of your days, ay, and long after that, to the end of
the world even.
Therefore, if you want to tell your friend your mind, do
not write, but speak it; a spoken bitterness may b forgotten
and forgiven, but a written one cannot be so readily forgiven,
and it can never be forgotten; no, not even if burnt; for
when we are stung in the perusal of something, the effect
goes deep, and becomes lasting, and can scarcely ever beTHE BUSINESS LETTER.
thoroughly erased, even by all-corroding time. A fierce
letter, a sharply written reproof, or a disparaging communication to a friend has been the cause of embittering many
a couple of lives; and it may be safely said that that should
never be written which we may, within possibility, wish
hereafter to recall. We are all fallible, and may, therefore,
be very much in error when we feel very sure that we are
in the right; and that consideration should be sufficient to
make any sensible man or woman pause before giving vent
to anger, with the pen in the hand.
But exceptions to such a rule may occur; an admonition,
a reproof, nay, even an accusation, may sometimes be necessary, and a letter be the cnly possible mode of conveying it.
Let good sense and good feeling determine how the case
shall be, and let it at be the same time borne in mind, that
what is once written cannot be unwritten, and that greater
caution is necessary in using the pen, than in using the
tongue.
THE BUSINESS LETTER
Must be pithy, short, and go straight to the point.
Pleasantry is not advisable, except between persgns who
are very intimate, and even then it is best to keep friendship and business as much apart as possible.
"The first thing necessary," says Lord Chesterfield, " in
writing letters of business, is extreme clearness and perspicuity; every paragraph should be so clear and unambiguous that the dullest fellow in the world may not be able
to mistake it, nor be obliged to read it twice in order to
understand it. This necessary clearness implies a correctness, without excluding an elegance of style. In business,
an elegant simplicity, the result of care, not of labor, is
required; nor does it exclude the usual terms of politeness
and good breeding, but, on the contrary it strictly requires
them."  A  writer, after iterating Lord Chesterfield's remarks, continues: "The one principal and pervading object
of all communications on matters of business is to convey
the thought which the writer is wishing to impart; that is
understood to be so important, that it alone is to be attended
to, and all interfering purposes rejected. And, if this intention be closely and freely followed, a beauty will spring up
in the very, plainness that will thereby be reached; for *aere
31CREST.RFIELD'S LETTER-WRITER.
is-a ratre and essential elegance abidiig in the barrenties
of mere and perfect perspicuity."
In writing, be particular, and clear, in arranging the
subjects of your letter. Some directions relating to this
and appicable to epistolary correspondence in every variety,
will be found in the immediately succeeding Section. Commence with the most important subject of your letter. To
every distinct subject, or point, allot a distict paragraph.
Long and involved sentences, or sentences composed of several members, mIust be avoided. For the sake of perspicuity, a careful attention to punctuation is necessary. At
the close of your letter, a short recapitulation of its leading
contents will be found useful: to your correspondent, in the
first instance; to yourself, in the second, as matter of reference in your copy.
Be prompt and punctual in your replies. A recapitulation, at the close of a reply, is yet more desirable than in
a first direct communication. "In this, however," observes
Anderson, in his Practical Mercantile Correspondence,
"merchants have also another object, which is to render
their letter-books, as far as possible, a history of their transactions, for the advantage of ready reference after a lapse
of years, and for production in court, with the better effect,
in case of litigation. Accordingly, every letter should
speak, as it were, for itself, and give all the necessary particulars of the transaction to which it refers."
All Letters should be dated; that is, they should present,
at either the head or conclusion, the year, the day of the
month, and the name of the place whence written. The
date of a letter is often of great importance in referenceespecially in affairs of business. For the same purpose,
it is a good plan also to place the date on the upper left
hand corner of the letter when folded, preceding the super.
scription.
Letters on business should be dated at the head-that is,
on the first page; together with the name and address of
tie parties written to, thus:
" New York, April 30th, 1867
"Messrs. James M. Harris &amp; Co., Philadelphia.
4 Gentlemen" We beg to inform you," &amp;c.

provide against accident, or an attempt at fraud, by teat
ing off the superscription of the letter, or destroying the
envelope in whih it might have been placed. In such a
case, it would be difficult to prove to whom the letter might
have been written; consequently, in a court of justice, its
production would be defective as evidence.
All letters, received in a manufacturing, mercantile, or
trading establishment, should, when read, be carefully folded
and endorsed, with the name of the correspondent, the date
of writing, and the date of receipt; with a blank left for
the date of the answer. For example:
"New York, March 10th, 1857.
"4 Williamson, Thompson, &amp; Co.
"Received, March the 12th.
"Answered,."
Many persons, not much accustomed to use the pen, have
a notion that if any occasion happens to call for a letter on
any business matter, that they must at once compose a
tedious rigmarole of statements and explanations; and, finding it difficult to make up what they consider a "capital
letter," they defer writing until the occasion is perhaps gone,
or at least until the business in htd has suffered considerable injury by the delay. But if they would divest their
minds of all ideas of literary composition, and just write
down what they would say, and in the fewest possible words,
such persons would find business correspondence agreeable
rather than irksome.  Thus a manufacturer of wooden
bowls writes to his wholesale house, tc ask for an advance of
cash, and commences thus:
"Sir,
"I am sorry to inform you that in consequence of not
being able to complete an order, which was sent me from
some parties at Albany, and which ought, and which I, indeed,
promised to have completed and forwarded by the freight train,
on Wednesday last, but which I have not sent on account of
being so short. I could not go into the market.for wood, and
therefore could not complete the order, and am obliged reluctantly to request of you to be so kind as to oblige me with an
advance by cash of one hundred dollars, on account of the
orders I have in hand for you, and which I shall je able, if you
can do me the favor'of obliging me with one hundred dollam

When his employer receives this he will look hard at it
t) cough his spectacles, read a few lines, then put it down
and take it up again, growing testy as he proceeds, and at
last toss it across the desk to his clerk, saying, "Here.
Crampton, I can't read Woodenhead's letter; just make it
out and answer it; it's as bad as having to read the supplement to a newspaper to have a letter of his come in."
Would not our friend tremble to see his request for one
hundred dollars on account handed over to a junior clerk,
perhaps to be forgotten for a day or two, or explained to
the principal in such a careless way as to insure for it either
no reply at all or one in the negative? Let him, therefore,
write a short, plain letter, thus:
"9 Ann Street, New York, July 27, 1856.
"S1R,-I find myself much pressed for cash, and have some orders from a house at Albany, which should have been completed
by Wednesday last, besides the goods which are in progress for

account I? That would enable me to complete and deliver the
goods I have in hand for you, by Tuesday next, as well as those
referred to for the house at Albany. As the case is an urgent

FAMILY EPISTOLARY CORRESPONDENCE.
AL. intercourse between parents and children, whether
colloquial or epistolary, should be free and confidential.
The heart, more especially of the child to the parent, should
be laid open without reserve. There ought to be no half
confidences. No friend can feel so deeply interested for
another's welfare as fathers and mothers for that of their
own offspring. Few are so well qualified to advise-to
make allowance for the errors of youth---to judge with
candor-to censure with mildness-to point out the right
path, or to reclaim from  the wrong one. There is no
subject upon which either son or daughter can have even a
chance of consulting another with so much advantage as a
parent. Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, Should

tions of the heart-improving and strengthening, expanding, and heightening each. On present feelings and circumstances, on future prospects, whom can the son consult with
so much propriety as his father-the daughter as her
mother? In cases which admit of the combined consultation-and there are few that do not-the advantage is more
than doubled to the child.
Next to the confidence between parents and children,
ought to be that between brothers and sisters--the tender.
est, holiest, most sympathetic affection.
If I may so express myself, I love to see fathers and
sons, as brothers-mothers and daughters, as sisters; and
this affection may exist in full force without in the slightest
degree infringing the relative duties between parent and
child. To create, however, where it may not exist naturally, the habit of ingenuousness and confidence in a childto foster and to cherish it where beautiful promise is given
from the birth-the parent should act with corresponding
frankness and affection. Virtue elicits virtue as surely as its
opposite engenders vice. To the neglect or unconsciousness
of this great truth must be.ascribed much of that coldness,
reserve, and estrangement which too often subsist in even
wellU-disposed families.
It i3 an old saying-and, like many other old sayings, it
requires to be accepted with due qualification-that "fami.
liaritybreeds contempt." In my view, this does not hold
good amongst well-regulated minds. On the contrary, I
considet that perfect respect is compatible with much familiarity. Form, ceremony, and etiquette, unless held in wise
subordihation, are very chilling in the social and affectionate
intercotrse of life, especially amongst relations and intimate
friends. Formerly, it was the practice for pupils to be
taught, when adressing their parents in the epistolary form,
to comrinence with the words, "Honored Sir," or "Madam,"
"Honored Parent," &amp;c. Much better, I conceive, and
without abating one iota of veneration or respect, to say,
" My dear Father," or "Mother"-or, "M y dear and
honored Father"-" My dearly beloved Mother," &amp;c., according to circumstance and feeling.
However, as, in the present Section, I am writing fbr the
instrucetion and benefit of youth, upon their entranuce into

school, enough Ias been said upon this head.
Forms are, indeed, of comparatively little importance.

brothers, sisters, dear and estimable friends-write to them
frequently, and at stated periods; weekly, fortnightly,
monthly, as circumstances may allow; but-be punctuaL
Under the new postage system, no excuse can be odmitted
on the plea of expense. By the establishment of periodical
times for writing, you know when to write, and when to expect a letter; all fruitless expectation, anxiety, and expense,
will thus be avoided. Correspondence between friends and
relations is, in every respect, more valuable, interesting, useflul, and pleasant to all parties, for being regular and punctual. In such cases you need not be parsimonious of words
or sentences. Avoiding mere verbiage, express your fbelings in the same easy, cheerful manner, that you would use,
were you at home and entertaining the family circle with
the incidental converse of the day. By this plan you will
enjoy the additional advantage of cultivating some of the
sweetest and noblest virtues of the human heart. Bit do
not get into the worse than useless habit, of correspoiding
with those from whose communications you derive nither
pleasure nor profit."
Examples, here, are hardly necessary; yet I have 0. few
before me, which, for their intrinsic merits and chaiacteristic propriety, are well entitled to perusal. The first is a
penitential letter from a youth, who had unwisely abaadoned

Unfortunately for me, the profession I have chosen by no
means meets with the concurrence of even my general friends,
and the world at large has hitherto held it in the light of contempt. What was the infatuation which filrst prompted me to
swerve from the path of wisdom and rectitude which you had
pointed out, I know not. Had I followed that, I might have
iiiade a more reputable stand in life; at any rate, moving in a
circle more honored than that into which I have thrown myself. But it is not for me to aggravate my misfortunes; my
task should rather be to reconcile them. If I succeed in removing any portion of your anger, I more than repay myself;
if not, it is at least a trifling evidence of my affection, though
repaying not a thousandth part of what I am indebted to you.
Mitigate, I pray you, your resentment. My most sanguine
hopes do not hint at sudden, or perhaps at any period, entire
forgiveness. Suffer me to write to you now and then-to feel
that I am addressing you-to relieve my aching heart, by assuring you how I love and honor you. May I entreat, too, you
will not let my mother participate with me in your anger. I
declare to you she is blameless in respect of this step I have
taken.
Imperfectly as I may have written, I still venture to send
you this sincere confession; but no attempt at extenuation of
my conduct. Your justice I must ever fear; in your mercy I
may have hope.

York, April 6th, 1792.
My second example, of a character widely different, now
for the first time meets the public eye. It is a letter written
from a young man to his brother, after the loss of their
sister; and, in allusion to a little difference which had unfortunately existed, it is distinguished by a naturalness, a
pathos, a correctness and purity of altectionate sorrow and
regret, which cannot but be deeply felt.
"My dear Brother,-I should earlier have acknowledged
the receipt of your letter, but, at the time when due, I heard
that you also were standing in the shadow of that cloud which
nad darkened our island home; and, in such cases, silence is

a reason akin to this, I will not here say much of that sorrow

and enjoyment of life. Yet, as death was the only escape
from all the grief, and pain, and disease which haunted her
later years, I must rejoice that it at last overtook her. She is
now where no echo from this world can reach her; and rests
well, I hope, after her most weary pilgrimage. The kindly
mention you make of hex is an earnest that she was not forgotten; and with you, I regret those circumstances which made
you, for a season, cotmparative strangers. What they were, I
never rightly understood, nor would it answer any purpose
now to inquire. All I can say is, that I ever found the dear
lost one a creature of most perfect disinterestedness, and can
call to mind no action of her life which bore the impress of
caprice or selfishness; I therefore conclude, that, whatever
the facts were, a very strong impression must have existed
in her mind, that slight had been intended; how generated,
of course impossible for me to say. But you must be well
aware, that the morbid fancies of invalids too frequently imagine offence where none might have been intended. A few
words would probably have explained all. Be it, however, as
it may, you are not one, I know, to think much of this now;
and, if there were blame, it will be more charitable and humane
to lay it to the account of the living than of the dead.
"It was her intention to acknowledge the receipt of your
marriage cards. Therefore, think of her as if that intention
had been really executed; as though the olive-branch had
been actually extended. Inability and death alone prevented
her peace-offering from reaching you."
We give the following real letter as a very pleasing
model and specimen of style:
"       COLLEE, Tesday Evening.

his whistle-that peculiar sucking sort of whistle, which always
indicates a puzzled state of brain. Little William and Henry

you will barely hear them breathe. And now mother has

she is thinking of her only absent child. Who can he be?
Will you doubt any more that I have studied magic, and can

"You have been even kinder than I expected, or you promised. I did not expect to hear from you till to-morrow, at the
earliest. But, as I was walking to-day, one of my class-mates
cried,'A bundle for you at the stage-office!' and away I went,
as fast as the dignity of a sophomore would allow me. The
bundle I seized, and muffled it undermy cloak, though it made
my arm ache, and, with as much speed as my' conditions *
would permit me, I reached my room. Out came my knife.
and forgetting all your good advice about'strings and fragments,' the said bundle quickly owned me victor, and opened
its very heart to me; and it proved a warm heart, too, for there
were the stockings (they are now on my feet, i e., one pair),
and there were the flannels, and the bosoms, and the gloves,
and the pincushion from Louisa, and the needle-book from
Sarah, and the paper from Mary, and the letters and love from
all of you. I spread open my treasures, and both my heart
and feet danced for joy, while my hands actually rubbed each
other out of sympathy. Thanks to you all for a bundle, letters
and love. One corner of my eye is now moistened, while, I

that your letters gave me more particular accounts of yourself,

that case, you would naturally miention the incidents of the day,
as where you had been, whom you had seen, what you thought
of them, etc. Do this in your letters: acquaint me somietimes
with your studies, sometimes with your diversions; tell me of
any new person and characters that you meet with in company,
and add your own observations upon them; in short, let me see
more of you in your letters. How do you go on with Lord

write you very freely my opinions upon men and things, which
I should often be very unwilling that anybody but you or Mr.

reserve, you may depend upon my inviolable secrecy. If you
have ever looked into the letters of Madame de S8vigne to

LETTERS OF CONDOLENCE.
IN our epistolary correspondence, there are perhaps no
letters so difficult to indite with due effect as those of condolence on the death of relations or near anld dear friends
Yet no difficulty, no experience of painful sensations, mIust
be allowed to deter the writer firom the performance of one
of the most sacred duties entailed on our sublunary state.
Letters of condolence, from the sympathising pen of friendship, fall upon the heart of man like the gentle dews of
evening in the parched earth. In the composition of such,
there must be no high-flown words or expressions, no
straining after effect. If heart speaks not to heart, in the
simplest, most soothing language of nature, words will, to
the sufferer, prove cold and unimpressive-worse than useless. Be it ever borne in mind, that, to the afflicted, to the
mourner in spirit, "there is only one true source of consolation-that we shall meet those we love in another and
a better world, where the wicked cease from troubling, and
where the weary are at rest. This is the hope our blessed
religion holds out to us, and its realization will amply repay
our sorrows here, whilst the anticipated joy blunts the edge
of present grief."
The subjoined epistle is from a lady-a young lady, but
hligh in literary fame-to a father, after the loss of an only
aiid much beloved daughter. It has not before been.submitted to the public eye. To mention the writer's name
would shed luster upon a work of infinitely more importance
than this.

evening), though, it is consolatory to state, with little bodily
suffering. She had borne her affliction with the fortitude of &amp;

was leaving this earthly state for a better and a happier in

"DEAR,-I am truly pained to hear of the melancholy
change in your circumstances. I had hoped that your husband's
position and connections would have prevented the possibility
of his embarking in any scheme where there seemed room for
uncertainty. But, unhappily, the speculative spirit of the age
is too seductive to be easily withstood, and we are every day
hearing of families being reduced to absolute poverty, more
from misbchance than wilful error.

persevering and consistent efforts; and, by the exercise of
economy, and the patient submission to a few privations, you
may ere long fully retrieve the position you have already adduced, and which legitimately belongs to you.

LOVE, COURTSHIP, MARRIAGE, ETC.
IF friendship be capable of waking sensations so warm
so strong, so elevated, in the human heart, what may not be
expected from love the liveliest, the noblest, the most soulinspiring, soul-absorbing of passions!
"Who hath not owned, with rapture-smitten frame,
The charm of grace, the magic of a name?"
I speak not of that love by which common minds are toe
frequently influenced, and which is little more than mere
animal instinct; but of that unselfish, hallowed, undying
affection which regards its object as a being of a higher order,
and for whose interests it is at all times ready and willing to
sacrifice its own. Under the influence of such a passion, no
creature, man or woman, can ever be guilty of a mean or a
base action. Love, true love, is the inspirer, the creator of
all our noblest virtues.
A gentleman is struck with the appearance of a lady,
and is desirous of her acquaintance, but there are no means
within his reach of obtaining an introduction, and he has nc
friends who are acquainited with herself or her family. In
this dilemma there is no alternative but a letter.
There is, besides, a delicacy, a timidity, a nervousness in
ywve. wl.ich makes men desire some mode of communicatiorCHESTERFIELD'S LETTER-WRITER.
rather than the speech, which, in such cases, too often fails
them. In short, there are reasons enough for writingbut when the enamored youth sets about penning a letter to
the object of his passions, how difficult does he find it! How
many efforts does he make before he succeeds in writing one
to suit him!  
It may be doubted whether ever so many reams of paper
have ever been used in writing letters upon all other subjects, as have been consumed upon epistles of love; and
there is probably no man living who has not at some time
written, or desired to write, some missive which might explain his passioss to the amiable being of whom he was
enamored; and'it has been the same, so far as can be judged,
in all the generations of the world.
Affairs of the heart--the delicate and interesting preliminaries of marriage, are oftener settled by the pen than in
any other manner. To write the words legibly, to spell
them correctly, to point them properly, to begin every sentence and every proper name with a capital letter, every
one is supposed to learn at school; still we give such instructions in another part of this book.
For a love letter, good paper is indispensable. When it
can be procured. that of costly quality, gold-edged, perfumed, or ornamented in the French style, may be properly
used. The letter should be carefully enveloped, and nicely
sealed with a fancy wafer-not a common one, of course,
where any other can be had; or what is better, plain or fancy sealing-wax. As all persons are more or less governed
by first impressions and externals, the whole affair should be
as neat and elegnt as possible.
Speaking of love letters generally, Moore, in his "Life of
Lord Byron," observes, that "such effusions are but little
suited to the public eye." Probably not; and therefore
they tught not to be subjected to the gaze of the public.
"It is the tendency of all strong feeling," he adds, "from
dwelling constantly on the same idea, to be monotonous;
and those often-repeated vows and verbal endearments, which
make the charm of true love letters to the parties concerned
in them, must for ever render even the best of them cloying to
others."  Without stopping to discuss the philosophy o1
this passage, I will hazard the assertion that it applies
accurately only to such love letters as the writer is most'ikely best acquainted with; "things that are of the earth,
54LOVE, COURTSHIP, MAIt,LAGE, ETC.       5~
earthy." Have lovers nothing to talk or to write about
but Cupids, and Venuses, and flowers, and hearts and darts!
I would not ask for a better criterion by which to test the
moral and intellectual powers of a man than his love letters,
premising, always, that the party addressed be an object
capable and worthy of inspiring a genuine passion. No
subject can be too exalted for the pen of an intellectual
lover.
How sweet and beatiful is the affection portrayed in
the following passages of a letter from a gentleman to a
Lady with whom he was on the point of being united iu
marriage:
"TROMSOE, May 28, 184-.," If you were but here, my Alette! I miss you every
moment, while I am'preparing my dwelling to receive you.
[ am continually wishing to ask you,' How will you have
this, Alette?' Ah, my ever beloved, that you were here at
this moment! You would be enraptured with this'land of
ice and bears,' at the thought of which I know you inwardly
shudder.      *
"' But the winter!' I hear you say,' the summer may pass
well enough, but the long, dark winter! Well, the winter,
too, my Alctte, passes happily away with people who love
each other, when it is warm at home. Do you remember,
last summer, how we read together at Christiansand, in the
morning paper, this extract from the Tromsoe Gazette?'We have had snow-storms for several days together, and
at this moment the snow-plow is at work, opening a path
to the churches.  The death-like stillness of night and
winter extends over meadow and valley; only a few cows
wander about, like ghosts, over the snowy tracts, to pluck a
scanty meal from the twigs of the trees that are not yet
buried in the snow.' The little wi,ter sketch pleased me,
but you shuddered   involuntarily at that expression,'the
death-like stillness of the night and winter, and bowed
your sweet dear face, with closed eyes, upon my breast.
Oh! my Alette, thus will it be when, in future, the terror of
the cold and darkness seizes thee, and upon my breast.
Listening to the beatings of my heart, the words of my
love, wilt thou forget these dark images of storm and
gloom?          *          C(lose thine eyes, slumber, my
beloved one, while I watch over thee. Thou snalt one day!ook upon night and winter, and own that their power is not
so fearful. Love, that geyser of the soul, can melt the teo~66       CHESTERFIELD'S LETTER-WRITER.
and snow of the most frozen regions. Wherever its warm
springs well up, there glows a southern climate."
The above comes before us in the form of liction; yet
every line bears the vivid impress of truth and nature. It
is from "Strife and Peace,' one of the charming novels of
Frederika  Bremer, a   Swedish author of coitemporary
celebrity.
The subjoined passage, from another of that lady's works,'The H -    Family," presents an equally beautiful picture
of affection in wedded life. It is from the letter of a newlymarried lady, the wife of a clergyman, to her friend:
"Beata, do you know what I pray, morning and evening, ay,
aourly, from the bottom of my heart?' I  God! make me
worthy the' love of my husband, grant me the power of
making him happy.' And I have received such power, for
te is (so he says and so he seems) very happy' If you.-new how well he looks, how gay! This is because I take
3o much care of him; then he does not dare talke so little
iare of himself as before; and then he works nii more min
the night; he has weaned himself of this; and so he thinks
and writes (he acknowledges himself) more freely and
powerfully than before. Then I am very careful no, to intei
upt or disturb him when he is in his studies, writing or readrng. Oh! when I would just get a glimpse of him (he is so
oeautiful, Beata), I steal in gently and play him a little trick.
I place a flower upon his book, kiss his brow, or do some such;hing, and go quietly back again, and when I turin round to
shut the door, I always get a glance from his eyes that follows

me for my unavoidable absence fromn your side, it is the pleasure of being able to pen a few lines to express, however feebly,

our evening duets, and our stolen conversations, to a dull routine

that by some means I have had the misfortune to incur your

I have so long struggled with my feelings, that they have now

have been unable to form one sane reflection, or to separato

have been totally unable to bring my thoughts into anything
like regularity, for they are so entirely mixed up with the
idea of yourself, that the business of the world, and the pursuits of amusement and pleasure, have been entirely forgotten
in the one passion that holds undivided empire over my soul.
I have deferred from day to day penning this confession to you,
in order that I might have been enabled tc have done so with
some degree of ease and calmness; but the hope has proved
fruitless. I can resist no longer, for to keep silent on a subject which is interwoven with my very existence, would be
death to me. No, I am unable to do so, and I have, therefore,
determined to lay open to you the suffering of my heart,,and
to imploro from you a restoration of that peace and happiness
which once were mine. You, my dear Miss --, are alone the
cause of my unhappiness, and to you alone can I look for a
relief from the wretchedness that has overwhelmed me. The
fervent passion that devours my soul for your adorable self,

fervently in return. But dare I ask so much purity, so much
sweetness, mildness and modesty, to make such a declaration?I know not what I say-but 0!!ny dear Miss -, be merciful,

in you, and my earnest hope is that you may be willing to appreciate the affectionate regard of one, who, however humble
in his present position, has every desire to elevate that position
for your sake.

Moore so philosophically regards as constituting the essence

CONCLUDING HINTS.
SoxM few general remarks on very simple matters-which
are, nevertheless, of much importance in the transactions of
every-day life-may be advantageously appended to the
specimens already laid before the reader.
There is great judgement required in using "Sir," or
Dear Sir," especially in addressing a person of superior
wordly position to yourself. Always reflect whether you
are on such terms with the person to whom you write as toCHESTERFIELD'S LETTER-WRITER.
warrant your using "Dear," or "My dear," before the moro
retiring phrase of address.
At the same time, the use of "Dear Sir," even towards a
stranger, is considered a graceful manner of addressing aD
inferior; but in responding to this, it would be preferable
to avoid too much familiarity atfirst. A golden rule in sueb
matters is, that nothing is lost by too much modesty, while
nothing gives so much offence as officious familiarity.
"Reverend and dear Sir" is a frequent address from one
clergyman to another, with whom he is supposed to have
little acquaintance, beyond that of being in the same profession. " Dear Sir" is afterwards adopted, when one or two
letters have passed between the parties.
"Dear Sir"' is frequently used in transactions between
gentlemen and their tradesmen; but such use must be guided
by the good sense of both parties. It must also be considered that the position and character of tradesmen render
them fully on a par with professional or independent persons. We are all equal in this free country.
"Honored Sir," though somewhat antiquated, is still frequently used, either in addressing a person in very advanced
years, a parent, a person to whom we have been under great
obligations, or in an appeal from a poor person to a rich
and powerful one.
Nearly the same rules apply to letters addressed to per
ons of the other sex.
Never send a note to a person who is your suDerior, unless
it be upon a very slight and indifferent matter. In asking a
favor of an intinmate friend, address him in the first person.
Do not take bad writing for freedom of gtyle.. Whatevea
pleasure your friends may derive from reading your lettera
you have no right to suppose that they have time for thei
study of hieroglyphics.
Always put a stamp on your envelope at the top of the
right hand corner.
Always use an envelope, except for letters of mere business. Fashion nQw demands it, and it has the advantages
of keeping the letter clean and insuring secresy.
What you have to say in your letter, say as plainly as
possible, as if you were speaking; this is the best rule. Do
not revert three or four times to one circumstance, but ni
up ats you go on.
tt your signature be written as plainly as posible (many
66CONCLUDING HINTS.                 67
misTakes will be avoidec, especially in writing to strangers)
and without any flourishes, as they tend not in any way ta
add to the harmony of your letter. We have seen signatures that have besn almost impossible to decipher, being a
mere mass of strokes, without any form to indicate letters
This is done chiefly by the ignorant, and would lead one to
sappose that they were ashamed of signing what they had
written.
Do not cross your letters; surely paper is cheap enough
now to admit of your using an extra half-sheet, in case of
necessity. (This practice is chiefly prevalent among young
ladies.)
Avoid the too frequent use of French and Italian phrases.
A letter thus larded is the fit production of a boardingschool miss.
If you are not a good writer it is advisable to use best
ink, the best paper, and the best pens, as, though they may
not alter the character of your handwriting, yet they will
assist to make your writing look better.
The paper on which you write should be clean, and neatly
folded.
There should not be stains on the envelope; if otherwise,
it is only an indication of your own sloveliness.
Common wafers should never be used, at least in general
correspondence. For letters of business they are still permitted. Should you send a note on business by hand, be
careful that the wafer is dry before it reaches the party addressed. Nothing is more offensive than a wet wafer. We
have seen a commercial man tear away the corner of a note
in great disgust, when delivered to him thus secured.
Courtesy requires that letters of condolence to a friend on
the death of a relative, should be written on black-edged
paper, and sealed with black wax, even should you have
een unacquainted with the deceased.
Give the proper address and date of writing at the head
-of every letter. Never assume that your correspondent knows
your address so well that it is unnecessary to repeat it.
Go straight to your main subject at once, whatever it may
be; for therein is the charm of all good writing. Just
rbserve how a clever "leader" in a newspaper arrests your
attention, by the very first line, or cnrtainly by the first
paragraph.
Avoid postscriptsa. for they are ugly, dwomani, and,H:EIESTERF[ELD'S LETTER-WRITER.
as a rale, unnecessary. Ladies are said to write long letters
having no meaning, and to crush into a postscript the only
matter of importance they have to communicate. This we
cannot believe. The fair are more shrewd than they get
credit for from their clumsy partners. A postscript containing the pith of the letter always reminds us of a cracker
attached to a dog's tail; the glory is at the wrong end, and
the spectacle is more likely to amuse the observer than
arrest the attention of his sober sympathies.
Long letters are more easily written than short ones, for
condensation requires some exercise of skill. Therefore, do
not take pride in the length of your letters, as our members of
the council of collective wisdom do in their long speeches, for
though both may serve as anodynes, or at least as soporifics,
yet we do not desire compulsory repose when we read the
one, or listen to the other. If you find it difficult to compress your thoughts rewrite your letter, and with a little
perseverance you will soon discover that a great many heres,
and theres, and whichs, and whats, and ifs, and buts, besides
no end of superfluous adjectives, that encumber the sense,
and render many things more "wonderful," " extraordinary,"
and "unparalleled." than they really are or ever will be.
In writing to a person, especially if a stranger, on your
own business exclusively, and wishing to receive e  answer,
do not fail to enclose a stamp for that purpose.
And, finally, remember that whatever you write is written evidence either of your good sense or your folly, your
indnstry or carelessness, your self-control or impatience.
What you have once put into the letter-box, may cost you
lasting regret. or be equally important to your whole future
welfare.. nd, for such grave reasons, think before you
write, and think while you are writing.

CHESTERFIELD'S
LETTER-WRITING SIMPLIFIEI ).
GooD letter-writing is one of the mainsprings of business,
and one of the strongest connecting links of common life.
To write a business letter, and to write a fanxfiliar one, re.
quire as different qualifications as to enter a drawing-room
and to knock at one's own street-door. Let us try to point
out what these qualifications are.
Tacd is equally necessary in both, but tact of a different
character. In writing to a man of business, brevity becomes
literally " the soul of wit," and true tact will teach us three
things; first, never to waste time in more compliments than
are demanded by the common courtesy due from one man
to another; secondly, never to say anything thathas nothing
to do with the subject: and thirdly, always to say all that
the subject really rquires, and to say that clearly. A letter
f ten lines.will often fulfill all these conditions, when a
lengthy epistle will bring back an impatient wish to " know
the meaning of your communication of.the-th"     in
writing letters we ought to consider that we may be wat.
Ig another person's time more precious than our own, in the
mere operation of reaing, to say nothing of understanding
and replying to them. But let us always remember, that it
is possib,.e to be brief and to the purpose, withaut being
bearish or uncourteous.
Tact in familiar writing, and in some halfbusiem-haf
familiar correspondence (which enters constantly into our
everyday life) consists in a clear and rey interpretation
of our thoughts and wishes, as w ell as in  propt and
fl understaning,of those of another:  e       are
