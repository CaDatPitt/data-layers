Note to Teachers. I have attempted, in the preceding lessons, to
present to the eye and mind of learners, a clear view of the union or
addition of small numbers, in forming larger numbers. It now remains,
to fix the sums of the several additions in the mnemory. For this purpose, the teacher may embrace each of the following comnbinations in
two separate questions. For example, (Lesson XI, combination first,)
9 and 4 are how many?-Then, 4 and 9 are how many?

SUBTRA CTI ON.
Note to Teachers. Children, who have learned addition, may easily
be taught subtraction, by leading them to observe the correspondence of
the two operations. Questions in addition, (distinguished by Italic print,)
are therefore connected with the questions in subtraction.
The teacher must here inform the learners, that the cipher, (0) represents nothing of itself, being used only to occupy a place.

PREFACE TO PART FIRST.
IN a systematic course of general education, Arithmetic claims a place
among the primary objects. Its elementary exercises, when rationally
conducted, are adapted to the capacities of children at a very early age.
Its influence on the character of children, in developing the reasoning
faculties, and habituating the mind to investigation, is highly conducive
to progress in every other branch of knowledge. Notwithstanding the
obvious truth of the above remark, the practice of postponing arithmetic
" till pupils arrive at the age of nine or ten years, still prevails in a great
/ part of our country, and calls for the attention of those, to whom the
concerns of popular education are intrusted.
The purpose of this Manual is, to facilitate the instruction of the younger classes in common schools. It contains the first part of a Course of
Exercises in.drithmetic, which is to be published in threeparts.
i The plan of the lessons accords with the method of instruction practised
tin the school at Stantz, by the celebrated Pestalozzi.- The method of'illustration, by the use of cuts, and the location of unit marks under questions, it is hoped, wi 1b'tind  to be an improvement. -
PART FIRST has been confined to the simple elements of arithmetic,
with a view of rendering it a suitable introduction to the subsequent study
of the science from books, which are already in ise, and which are thought
to be deficient in elementary exercises.
The slate and pencil are not required, in the performance of the lessons contained in Part First. On the title page, will be seen, a drawing
of an improved structure of the Afbacus. It is a convenient apparatus
for illustrating the combinations of numbers, and may be used in con
nexion with these lessons, although it is not indispensable.

recommended by all the Masters of the Departments of Writing and Aritllmetic, in the City of Boston; and, that the Boston Selihol ommittee have ordered its introduction into the City Schools, to be used by all the pupils as
early as they are able to read.LESSON VII.

DIVISION.JNote to Teachers. It will be perceived, that, in the preceding examples, Division has been viewed in only one of its purposes-that of
investigating the number of times a small number is contained in a
larger. We have now to pursue the same process, for the purpose of
dividing the larger number into as many equal parts, as there are units
in the smaller number, and discovering the magnitude of one of the parts.
LESSON XIV.
James and Henry had six raisins, to divide between them.   They said,'W e are 2 boys, and there
are 6 raisins.  Now if each of us take up one raisin,
then t,wo raisins will be taken up; therefore, we can
each of us take up as manly raisins, as there are twos
in the six.' How many could each boy take up?

we can each of Ius take 1 miarble fromn every 3 marbles.'  How many marbles did each boy get?!J UJ

5 boys had 20 marbles to share between them,
and the oldest boy performed the division. He said,
I One boy must have one fifth of the marbles. One
fifth of 5 is 1, and one fifth of 20 is as many times
1, as there are fives in 20.' To prove what he said,
he placed the marbles in a row, and, after rolling out
1 from every 5 for hitnself, requested the other boys

MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES..Note to Teachers. Scholars will be found able, at this period of
the course, to perform all the simple operations, which do not imply the
combination of numbers higher thlan 10. Further practice, however,
will be requisite, to enable them to determine the operations proper to
be adopted in promniscuous qiuestions.
The books may be open during the recitation of all the succeeding lessons, and the questions may be read either by the scholars or the teacher. The scholars should perforin the operations audibly, and give
their own reasons for the process they adopt. It is essential, that the
pupils' own apprehensions should (lirect them, in the process of solution
Therefore, theey should not be compelled, nor even allowed to use any
form of expression, which they have not made their own. Their first
attempts at reasoning, however puerile, should not be rejected-they
should be received with complacency, and corrected in a manner, not
likely to destrov their reliance upon their own understanding.

younger than herself.      How   many sisters has she?

represented by FIGURES. He may direct them, to obtain the names
of the figures by counting the unit marks, (from left to right,) which
stand against the figures severally, in the following table. As this exercise will tend to fix a mental association of each figure with the number
of units, which it represents, the lesson should not be omitted, even by
children, who are already able to read figures.

NUMERATION... 10.Note to Teachers. The purpose of the following lesson is, to teach
Counting, and Reading _Figures, as high as one hundred. It will
easily be effected, by exercising the learners in reading the numbers,
written in columns; and, at the same time, leading them to observe the
analogies, two-twenty; three-thirty; four--forty; &amp;c.

LNUMERATION.Note to Teachers. The pupils having been accustomed to consider
each line of units separately, it will now be necessary for the teacher, to
give them an exam,ple of continuing the count from line to line. He
should, also, instruct them to take into one view, all the lines of stars,
which they count, in order to obtain a just idea of the number.
LESSON VI.
How   many stars are there in the upper line,
counted across the page, from left to right?
If you count the stars in the first and second line
together, how many will they make?
In three lines, how many stars are there?
In four lines, how many stars are there?
In five lines, how many stars are there?
In six lines, how many stars are there?
In seven lines, how many stars are there?
In eight lines, how many stars are there?
In nine lines, how many stars are there.?
In ten lines, how many stars are there?
What numbers are expressed by these figures?
