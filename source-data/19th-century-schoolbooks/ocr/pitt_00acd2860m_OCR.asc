CONTENTS/.84      RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
The names of nany other pastors in the South might
be given, who have conscientiously and for a series of
years, devoted much time to the religious instruction of
the Negroes connected with their churches.
The Rev. James Smylie and Rev. John L. Montgomery were appointed by the synod of Mississippi in 1839
to write or compile a catechism for the instruction of the
Negroes. The manuscript was presented to synod in
October 1840 and put into the han(ls of a committee of
revision, but it has not yet been published.
The table on the state of the churches of the Sunbury Baptist Association, Georgia, gives six African churches with a total of members of 3,987, as returned; one
of these churches did not return the number of communicants. Of the other churches in the table, five have
an overwhelming  majority of colored nmembers. The
three African churches in Savannahl are all connected
with this association. In the appendix to the minutes it
is said, " The committee, to whom was referred brother
Sweat's letter on the subject of a mission among the African churches report-that it is highly important that
such a mission slhould be established and( recommend
that the subject be turned over to the executive committee, with instructions that the brethren engaged in that
work, during the past year, be compensated for their services: your committee ftlrther recommend that brother
Connor be employed as a missionary by the association,
provided, he will devote half his time to the colored people."  And again: " That the table showing the state
of the churches, may be more correct than the present,
it is requested that at the next meeting of the association,
the church clerks will (listinguish in their reports, between the white and colored members, and that suchHISTORICAL SKETCI-1.
churches as send no delegates will forward a statement
of their con(lition."
M ilissions to the people of color," ate noticed in the
anntal report of the missionary society of the M. E.
Church, in 1840. The report thus speaks. " And surely
those who devote themselves to the self-sacrificing work
of preaching the Gospel to these people on the rice and
sugar plantations of the South and Soutlh-wvest, are no
less deserving the patronage of the missionary society
than those whllo labor for the same benevolent object in
other portions of the great work. Of these there are,
chiefly in the Southern conferences, 12,402 members
under the patronage of this society."-Report p. 23.
1841. The report of the same society for this year,
refers also to "missions to the colored population."
"In no portion of our work are our missioniaries called
to endure greater privations or malke gieater sacrifices
of licalth and life, than in these missions among the
slaves, many of which are located in sections of the
Southern country which are proverbially sickly, and
under the fatal influence of a climate which few wvhite
men are capable of enduring even for a single year.
And yet. notwithstanding so many valuable missionaries
have fallen niartyrs to their toils in these missions, year
after year there are found others to take their places, who
fall likewise in their work,' ceasing at once to work and
live.' Nor have our superintendents any difficulty in
finding missionaries ready to fill up the ranks which
death has thinned in these sections of the work; for the
love of (Christ and the love of the souls of these poor
Africans in bonds, constrain our brethren in the itinerant
work of the Southern conferences to exclaim,'here
are we, send us!' The Lord be piaised for the zeal

and success of our brethren in this self-denying and selfsacrificing work."
The mnissionary society of the S. C. conference, reported this year, of mnissions exclusively to the Negroes,
14; plantations served, 301; mernmbers, (i,145; chil(lren
unler catechetical instruction, 3,407; and rnissiiona.ies,
IS. Thle rep;)rt gives an animatedl at.dl cleering view of
the prospects of these missions. The great object of
the society in them is thus expressed. "So to Ireach
this Gospel that it may be believed; andl bleing believed,
may prove'the power of God unto salvation,' is the
great object, and, we repeat it, the sole object of our
ministrations among the blacks. This object attained,
ve finld the terminus *of our anxieties and toils, of our
preaching and prayers." - Report pp. 12 - 17.
The total of colore(d communicants in the Metho(list
connection is given in the minutes of the annual conferences for the years 1840, 1841. F'or 1840, 94,532; for
1841, 102,158.  The South Carolina conference is
ahead of all, having 30,481; next comes the Baltimore
conference, 13,904; then the Georgia conference, 9,989;
Philadelphia, 8,778; Kentucky, 6,321, and so on. - Min.

The Sunbury association reported this year seven
African churches, with 4,430 members; (from one no
returns:) ad(ling to this number the returns fromr the mixed
churches of white and black, and an estimate of some
from which no returns were made, a total of 5,664 colored members is obtainied. Appendix B: "Resolved,
That the committee be authorized to offer a sum not
exceeding $50 per month, for one or more ordained
ministers to labor among the colored people and destitute churches wvithin the bounds of this association."IIISTORICAL SKETCII.
Bishop Mead?. of Va. made a report to the convention
of his diocese "on thle best 7necas of promrnting the

the Negroes, embracing 1,400 in the congregations.~
Children catechised on the plantations.
The practice of thle Episcopal church in this diocese
cannot be too highly commen(led to those who are of
similar faith in the matter referred to, which is the baptism, of the infants and children of Negroes who are
members of the church. When God established his
visible church on earth he constituted the infant seed of
believers members of it, and therefo,re cornmmande(l that
the sign anri seal of his gracious covenant should be
applied to them. His cllurcli has ever remained the
same; the members the same; under the same constitution. Our practice ought to conform to our faith; to
the plain teachings of the word of God. A recurrence to
this subject will be necessary when the means and plans
for the religious instruction of the Negroes come under
consideration in the fourth pait of this worlk, and I
therefoire (lismiss it in this l)lace. There were 159 coloredl chil(lren bapt:ze(l in the churches of the eliocese,

From the seventh annual report of the Liberty County
Association for the religious instructioni of the Negroes,
it appears that the efforts of the Association (luring the
year had been successfuil. There were 450 children and
youth iundler catechetical instruction; anri addling four
schools not imnme(liately under the care of the Association, but conducted by members of it, there were 265
more. Seven Sabbath schools in all were returned, and
three stations f(ir preaching. Congregations during the
year fill and attentive; general older of the people
commendable.IIISTORICAL SKETCII.
Appended to this report is the address to the Association, by the president, the RIev. Josiah Spry Law.
An address which received the cordial antl unanimous
approbation of the Association as one which placed the
religious instruction of the Negroes in a clear light, as
the grceat duty of their owners; as well as of the churches.
It was believedl by the Association that the a(ddress cwas
calculated to exert a favorable influence wherever it
shiould b-e circulated in our country an(l it was therefore, with the consent of the author ordered to be
printedl.
Having now presented such facts and information
under each year of this period, as I have been able to
collect, I shall now give a summary (and ta very brief
one) of the action of ecclesiazstical bodies, lndl of w,hat
has been done by different denominations of christians.
I knowv of no action of ecclesiastical bo(lies on the
great subject of thle religious instruction of the Negroes,
in the free States, at least of no very prominent action;
altho' efforts have been made by benevolent individuals
and societies, for their physical, intellectual and moral
improvement in most of the cities and chief towns of
the free States, and not without success. These efforts
came into notice about the beginning of the period now
under consideration. Children and youth were gathered
into week (lay and Sabbath schools: improvements
were made in their houses for public worship, and some
permanent supplies obtained for their pulpits. Distressed families and orphans were sought out and visited and
taken care of, and persons out of employment were assisted in obtaining it. But a small part however of the
entire population was reached and permanently benefited, as I had occasion to know from personal observation

in 1827 and in 1829 in Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New York, INew Jersey and Pennsylvania.
For example, I found them in Providence, Rhod(e Island,
with almost none to care for their souls. With a few
respectable exceptions, they inhabited the most castaway, decayed and debauched parts of the town, anti
were as (leep in poverty, idleness, improvidence and
immorality as can well be imagined. I saw two, three
and four, and sometimes even more families occupying
the differcnt rooms and stories of one house. The Negro quarters of Boston, New York an(d Phila(delphia
presented pretty much the same features. Mly observations repeated again in the spring and summer of 1839
convinced me that there was abundant room for the improvement of the Negroes of the free States, and moreover, that the practical interest among the whites in their
religious instruction was not remarkable. But to proceed, Dr. Anderson of Boston informed me while on a
visit to that city in 1839 " that the present generation
of Negroes who had enjoyed the advantages of education were in advance of those that had preceded them,
and were getting into respectable employments; and
that very considerable efforts had been made on their
behalf." The Rev. Samuel S. Jocelyn has been for
many years an indefatigable laborer, fox the moral and
religious improvement of the Negroes in New Haven.
Professor Maclean showed me a neat house of worship
erected by himself in conjunction with other benevolent
individuals, for the Negroes in Princeton, New Jersey.
There are houses of public worship exclusively for
the Negroes in all the cities of the free States, where
there numbers make it an object, and the pulpits are
supplied by ministers of their own color, and some ofHISTORICAL SKETCII.
them educated men of highly respectable talents and
standing, sometimes they are supplied by white ministers. There are Sabbath schools for the instruction of
children and youth, supported and tauglht chiefly by
white persons. For example, " in Portland, Maine, the
colored population is about 400. They have one Congregational church, and an educated colore(l pastor, and
a Sabbath school conducted by white teachers."
It is not necessary to go into an enumeration of the
houses of public worship in Boston, New York, Philadelphia an(l other places. In country towns and villages,
the Negroes hlave seats appropriated to them in the whliite
chturches. They are of different denominations, Episcopal, Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian.
Of late years the Negroes in the free States have manifested a strong inclination to be independent of the
influence and control of the whites, andi to create and
manage their ecclesiastical establishments in their own
way; a very natural inclination, and not to be wondered
at, nor objected against, provided, they are capable of
taking care of themselves, which however, many of their
warmest friends not only seriously doubt but wholly deny.
As a specimen of this disposition I would refer to the
secession of Richard Allen and his associates in Philadelphia, from the Methodist church, which secession
extended into New York and other states. Of this secession in New York, Dr. Bangs thus writes, " it is now
(1839) twenty years since this secession took place, and
the degree of their prosperity may be estimated from
the following statement of their number of circuits and
stations, preachers and members taken from their minutes for 1839. Circuits 21, preachers 32, members 2,608.
These circuits and stations are found in the states of
91%92     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROE3.
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island and
Massachusetts. In the city of New York where the
secession originate(l they have a membership of 1,325,
making an increase of 396 in twenty years, which is by
no means in a ratio with their increase while they remaine(l under tlhe care of their white brethien. In the
city of Boston however, their success has b)een greater
in proportion, In 1819 they had only 33, but now, in
1839 they have 126. As'the M. E. Church never derived any temporal emolument firom them, so we have
sustained no other d(amage by the secession than what
may arise from missintg the opportunity of doing them all
the good in our power as their pasto,rs, etc."
In the slave Slates there has been action in ecclesiastical bodics on thle religiouts instruction of the Negroes,
an(d the value of stlch action is, that it (liscovers a good
dispositi(on on the part of ministers and churches to
fulfil their duty to this people.
The Episcopal churc7h, has rather taken the lead in
making efforts and in keeping up an interest in its own
bosoin. Bishop Meade of Virginia, a long and unwearied advocate of this cause, Bishop Ives of North Carolina:
Bishop Bowen of South Carolina (before his decease)
and the present bishop of that State, Dr. Gadsden, have
each addressed their dioceses on this subject; and commended it to the clergy and laity. The subject has been
discussed in their conventions, accompanied with some
able reports. Many of the clergy devote time to the
instruction of the Negroes attached to their congregations; and have iegular and flourishing Sabbath schools.
It is stated as a fact, that in the Episcopal churclhes generally in South Carolina there are Sabbath schools for
the Negroes, and some of them large and flourishing.HISTORICAL SKETCII.
There are several Episcopal missionaries to this people
in the State. The churches in Charleston have always
been active in the instruction of the Negroes; and tzhe
present bishop, Dr. Gadsden, has been longo known as
an advocate of the work. T'he lately elected bis!lop of
Georgia, Rev. Stephen Elliott, D. D., has brought the
subject before his convention in his "primary addre.zs,"
(1841,) and urged attenltion to it with an energy and a
zeal whichl promise great blessings to the Negroes connected with the churches of his new and interesting
diocese. The Negroes connected with the Episcopal
church have generally been noted for intelligence and
fidelity.
The Methodists perhaps do not yield in interest and
efforts to any denomination. Fromn the commerncement
of their churclh in the Unlited States, they have paid attention to the Negroes; of which we have had atnple
proof in the progress of this Sketch. In the sl;ave States
they have, next to the Baptists, the largest iiumber of
communicants. The Negroes are brought under the
same church regulations as the whites, having class
leaders and class-meetings and exhlorters; and cases of
church discipline, are carefully reported and acted upon
as the discipline requires. The number of Negro communicants is reported at their conferences, as well as
labors in their behalf and where it is necessary traveling preachers are directed to pay attention to them. In
the South Carolina conlference the missionary society
already referred to, lhas a field of operations among the
Negroes along the seaboard, from North Carolina to the
southern counties of Georgia. The missionaries of this
society labor chiefly on river bottoms, anid in districts
where the Negro population is large and the white popu93CONTENTS.                       ix.

this denomination so fiilly devoted  to tllis particular

of the slave-holdinlg states.  Withlout doubt as the Lord

T/Le Baptists ha;ve nio societies in existellce expressly

alone; there are three, for example, in thle city of Savannalh. A year or two since I preached to the Baptist
Negroes in Petersbiurg, Va., in their own house of worship, crowded to suffocation.
7 1e Presbyterians have lhad ecclesiastical action
witlin the present period, in the syniods of Virginria and
North Carolina; South Carolinia and Georgia; Kentulcky
Mississippi, andt Alabama; and in presbyteri;s in all these
synods.  Some presbyteries have distillguislled themselves by their zeal and activity in the instruction of the
Negroes.
It is unnecessary to transcribe the resolutions, reports
and acts of these several bodies. Soimie have already
met the eye of the reader. The latest and most general
and satisfactory returns in our possession were gathlered
from the statements of members of the general assembly
of 1839, from  the slave-holding States, at a meeting
called by themselves for the )purpose of takinig into consideration the religious instruction of the Negroes, and
of communicating information and suggesting plans of
operation.  It will suffice to present the sum of the
whole in a few words.
In the synods of Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina,
Tennessee, and West Tennessee, it is the practice of a
number of ministers to preach to the Negroes separately
once on the Sabbath, or during the week. There are
also Sabbath schools in some of the churches for children and adults; and in all the houses of worship, with
but few exceptions, a greater or less number of colored
members and Negroes form a portion of every Sabbath
congregation. In portions of these synods the abolition
excitement checked and in others materially retarded the
work of instruction.96       RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
In the synods of Alabama and Mlississippi, almost all
the ministers devote a portion of the Sabbath to the
Negroes. There are two or three missionaries within
the bounds of these synods, and some flourishing Sabbath schools. Access in many parts of the two States
may be had to the Negroes, of unlimited extent. The
abolition excitement injured the cause.
In the synod of South Carolina and Georgia many
ministers preach to the Negroes separately on tile Sabbath or duri:ng the weel, anid nmaintain Sabbath schools;
especially is this the fact, along tile sea-board of the two
States.  The presbytery of Georgia has one missionary
to the Negroes, and in the county where he labors, there
are seven Sabbath schools connected with the Congregational and Baptist churches, and upwards of 600 children
and youth in a course of catechetical instruction. There
are three stations for missionary preaching on tile Sabbath, occutpied in rotation, and in addition, during the
winter and spring, preacliing on the plantations. There
are colored members in all the churches in this synod,
and accommodations for the Negroes irn the houses of
public worship; the sessions conduct the discipline of
the colored members in the same manner that they do
the white; tliey are received into the churches, under
the same form and partake of the ordinances at the same
time.
The ministers in the newly formed Presbytery of Florida are devoting attention to this field of labor, dispersing information and preaching as opportunity offers.
Such are the principal facts touching the religious
instruction of the Negroes during the third Period, from
1820 to 1842. And in view of them, as we close the
Period, we feel warranted in considering it a period ofIIISTORICAL SKETCII.
the revival of religion in respect to this particular
duity, throu.ghout tel Southern States; more especially
betweenr the years 1829 and 1835.
This revival came silently, extensively, and powerfully;
affecting masters, mistresses, ministers, members of the
churchl, and ecclesiastical bodies of all the different
evangelical denominations.  Some local associations of
planters were formed, and societies on a large scale contemplated, and one brought to perfect organization.
Sermons were preached and pamphlets published; the
daily press lent its aid; and manuals of instruction were
prepared aud printed. Nor was there any opposition of
moment to the work, conducted by responsible individuals, identified in feeling an(d interest with the country.
Some portions of the South were in advance of others,
both in respect to the acknowledgement an(l performance
of the great (luty; but the light was gradually diffusing
itself every whlere.
Such was the onwar(l course of things when the
excitement in the free States on the civil condition of
the Negroes marifeste(d itself in petitions to Congress,
in the circulation of inflamlmatory publications, andl other
measures equally and as justly obnoxious to the So)uth;
all which had( a disastrous influence on tile success of
the work we were attempting to do. The effect of the
excitement was to turn off the attention of the South
frorn the religious to the civil condition of the people
in qulestion; andti from the salvation of the soul, to the
defernce andt preservation of political rights. The very
foun(lations of societ.y were assailed( andt men wvent forth

with jealousy. Timid, ambitious, and factious men, and
men hostile to religion itself, and men desirous of warding off suspicion from themselves, agitated the public
mind within our own borders.   The result was, to
arrest in many places efforts happily begun and successfully prosecuted for the religious instruction of the Negroes. It was considered best to disband schools and
discontinue meetirngs, at least for a season; the formation
of societies and the action of ecclesiastical bodies, in
some degree ceased.
The feelings of men being excited, those wlio had
undertaken the religious instruction of the Negroes were
looked upon with suspicion and some of them were
obliged to quit the field. It was not considered that a
separation might be made between the religious and the
civil condition and interests of a people; and that a
minister could confine himself to the one without interfering at all with the other. This entire effect upon the
slave States of the movements in the free States, considering all circumstances, was natural, but it was wrong
-wrong, because, let others act as they might, we
should have gone forward and done what was obviously
our duty. We could have done it; for the whole arrangement of the religious instruction of the Negroes, as to
teachers, times, places, matter and manner, was in our
own power. And wrong again, because, admitting that
the wishes of these professed friends of the Negroes
were to be consummated, no better could be done for
the Negroes, nor for ourselves, than to teach them their
duty to God and man. The Gospel certainly hurts no
man and no body of men. Parts of the Southern
Country took such action as was deemed necessary, (if
any at all,) calmly and decidedly, nor were any difficulHISTORICAL SKETCH.
ties thrown in the way of the regular course of religious
instruction. A missionary in the heart of three or four
thousand Negroes, during the period of excitement, visited plantations during the week, and met congregations
on the Sabbath varying from 150 to 500 persons; yet it
cannot be denied that the Northern movements did sensibly affect the feeling in favor of the religious instruction of the Negroes, throughout the whole slave-holding
States, and the first and prominent cause of decline in
the revival of which we speak, was unquestionably those
movements; and I mention the fact because the cause
of that decline is sometimes inquired into.
From information obtained by correspondence, and
in other ways, there are favorable indications that a reaction has taken place within one or two years past;
and that, taking the country throughout, more religious
instruction is communicated to the Negroes now than
ever before. The old friends of the cause for the most
part retain their integrity, and labor on, while the Lord
is impressing deeply the hearts and consciences of owners and is raising up many youth in the ministry and in
the churches to carry forward the work more extensively.
The third Period is now completed, and with it this
Ilistorical Sketch of the Religious Instruction of the
Negroes, since their first introduction into this country
to the present time. I shall add, in the conclusion, the
following general observations:
1. The Negro race has existed in our country for two
h-undred and twenty-two years; in which time the Gospel has been brought within the reach of, and been communicated to, multitudes; and tens of thousands of
them have been converted, and have died in the hope
99100     IELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
of a blessed immortality. And there are at the present
time, tens of thousands connected by a credible profession, to the church of Christ; and the Gospel is reaching them to a greater extent and in greater purity and
power than ever before.
2. While there have been but few societies, and they
limited in extent an(d influence, forme(l for the special
object of promoting the moral and religious instruction
of the Negroes; and(l while there have been comparatively bult few missionaries exclusively devoted. to them:
yet they have not been altogether overlooke(l by their
owners, nor neglecte(l by the regular ministers of the
various leading denominations of Christians, as the facts
adduced in this Sketch testify.
3. Yet it is a remarkable fact in the history of the
Negroes in ouir Country that their regular, systematic
religious instruction, has never received in the churches
at any time, that general attention ard effort which it
demanded; andl the people hlave consequently been left,
both in the free and in the slave states, in great numbers,
in moral darkness, and (lestitution of the means of grace.
4. The great and go)d work, therefore, of the thorough relzgious instruction of our Negroes remains
to be performed.
The colored population of the United States in 1830
was 2,009,043 slave andl 319,599 free; making a total
of 2,328,642: by the last census, 1840, it was 2,487,113
slave and 389,235 free, with a total of 2,873,348. This
aggregate of 2,F173,348, is certainly large enough to
awaken out most serious attention, whether we view
this people in a religious or civil point of light.
T'heir actual moral and religious condition, next
claims our notice.PART II.
THE Moral and the Religious Condition of the Negroes
in the United States.
CHAPTER I.
Disadvantages to be encourtered in prosecuting an inquiry into the
Moral and lReligious condition of the Negroes in the United States.
A knowle(lge of the moral an(d religious condition of
the Negroes is essential to correct feeling and action
thereto. Until we arrive at such knowledge an(d have it
pressed upon our serious consi(leration, we shall have
no just sense of obligation - we shall feel no criminality
for past neglect- no (lisposition for future amendment:
nor shall we be able to adopt plans for their improvement, as we must necessarily become acquainted with
the nature and extent of a disease before we can hopefully prescribe for it.
That an inquiry into the moral an(l religious condition
of the Negro population of the United States, may be
prosecuted with success, ad(mits of no question. And
yet, whether we live at the North or at the South, notwithstanding we enjoy favorable advantages for the
inquiry, we certainly labor under some very serious
9*102     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
disadvantages, which threaten to impair the faithfulness
with which it should be prosecuted and answered. Nay,
these disadvantages may exert such an influence upon
some, that admitting the inquiry to be prosecuted and
answered according to truth, they may withhold assent.
These disadvantages therefore demand consideration.
They arise, in general, out of our intimate and long
continued connection with this people.
Habits of feeling and prejudices in relation to any
subject are wont to take their rise out of our education
or circumstances. Every man knowvs their influence to
be great in shaping opinions and conduct, and ofttimes
how unwittinlgly they are formed; that while we may
be unconscious of their existence they may grow with
our growth and strengthen with our strength. Familiarity converts deformity into comeliness. Hence we
are not always the best judges of our condition. Another may remark inconveniences and indeed real evils
in it, of which we may be said to have been all our
lives scarcely conscious.. So also evils which upon-first
acquaintance revolted our whole nature and appeared
intolerable, custom almost makes us forget even to see.
Men passing out of one state of society into another
encounter a thousand things to which they feel that they
can never be reconciled; yet shortly after, their sensibilities become dulled - a change passes over them they
scarcely know how-they have accommodated themselves to their new circumstances and relations --they
are Romans in Rome.
That the people of the United States indulge prejudices in respect to the Negroes, both in favor of and
adverse to them, as a distinct variety of the human
family and as a subordinate class in society, is a fact notMORAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.
to be disguised. On the one hand their ignorance, vulgarity, idleness, improvidence, irreligion, and vice, are
to be ascribed altogether to their position and circumstances; let these be changed for the better, and the
African will immediately equal, if not greatly excel, the
rest of the human family in majesty of intellect, elegance of manners, purity of morals and ardor of piety;
yea, they will become the very beau ideal of character,
the admiration of the world. On the other hand, the
race has been from time immemorial just what it is and
just what it must continue to be. It occupies the position designed for it in nature and Providence, and no
changes an(d no efforts can ever, on the whole, alter it
for the better. Prejudices, also, lie all along between
these extreme oscillations of opinion. Happy is that
mind which under gales of excitement and conflicting
with waves of agitation, preserves its balance, and keeping its eye upon the truth, steadily advances towards it.
It may be likened to the well adjusted compass, which
noiselessly preserves its equilibrium, and faithfully points
to the star, although the mountain waves roar and the
ship is driven with the fierce winds and tossed.
The first disadvantage which I shall mention is our
intimate knowledge of the degraded moral character
of the Negroes.
From childhood we have been accustomed to their
slovenly, and too frequently, their scanty dress; to their
broken English, ignorance, vulgarity, and vice. What
in them would disgust or grieve a stranger, or truly
afflict us if seen in white persons, we pass by with little
or no impression, as a matter of course; - they are
Negroes. Their character is held in low estimation,
throughout the United States; and, considering what it

is, not without reason; for that character cannot be
esteemed which in itself is not estimable. W'hatever is
idle, dissolute, criminal, and worthless, attaches to them.
Unconsciously, or rather, instinctively, we determine
what the firuits must be frorn their known character,
condition, and circumstances; and whlen they do appear,
we are not surprised. WYe say, " what better can be
expected?"
Such a general corruption of morals as would blast
the reputation of any white community, is known to
exist among them; an(d yet how unaffected are we by it?
Indeed, the habit of ou,r mind is to consider them in a
state of moral (legradation; to expect little that is truly
excellent all(l praiseworthy; anil to feel lightly, and to
pass over as well as we can, what is revolting in tthem.
We are dispose(l not to try tlhem as we wouldl others by
that standard which is holy, just, and good; but by a
low and worldlly standard, accommodated to their character and circumstances. Vice seems to lose its hitleousness in proportion as it shades itself in black; as in
painting, with black we obliterate the warm light and
soft shades, and native hues, whicli gave depth and life
and beauty to the picture, and the eye rests upon the
dark, dead surface without emotion.
A second disadvantage is our difference of color,
and our superior relations to them in society.
At the head of the varieties of the human race, stan(ls
the fair, or Caucassian varicty; "which," to use the
language of another, "has given birth to the most civilized nations of ancient an(d mo(lern times, and has exhibited the moral and intellectual povwers of human
nature in their highest (legree of perfection."  At the
foot, stands the blc.ck or Ethiopian variety, " which hasMIORAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.
ever remained in a ru(le ant( barbarous state; and been
looked upon and treate(d as inf.erior by all the other
varieties of the hluman race, from time immemorial."
There is stperiority on the one hand and inferiority
on the other. Ascribe it to whatever cause yotu may;
whether to the immediate providence of God, or to
nature itself--to a (lifference in o,riginal constitution, or
to circumstances; the fatct remains, and it can but be
seen an( ifelt. It is oiily with the fact, and its influence
on us, that we have to (1do. We learn the fact in our
elementary studies at school; a larger acquaintance
with the history of the world and extersive observation
in after life, impress it miore deeply. A sense of this
superiority is ltur(ditary in the citizens of the firee
States; originally and(l not very long ago these States
were slave States. It has been propagated from father
to son, an(l ex)hibits itself in the manners anti customs,
and on all the face of society there. It may be wearing

ential in our case in the Som:th, is that we still continue
to maintain the relation of master, and all the differS
ences in our standling, privileges, an(I circumstances in
society, created by that relation, in custom and in law.
There is, consequently, sup?'riolity on the one side and
inferiority on the other, in almost every point of view.
But as we are masters, so are we managers,    They
neither can nor will plan and execute their work by
directions alone.  We are compelle(l to see that they do

virtuously. left to themselves, we are again compelled to

in contact with their depravity in its multiplied derelopements. We are astonished from time to time at the
(lisclosure of their duplicity, dishonesty, trick, and cunning. Those only who have, or have had, the management of Negroes, know what the hardening effect is
upon their own hearts. That man who takes possession
of his property and commences the management of his
people with that feeling of interest and tenderness which
he has cherished for them from his childhood, and with
a willingness to favor them in every way, must be watchful; otherwise, from their general character and behaviour, painfully exhibited to him, he will withdlaw his
confidence entirely and settle down into a state of indifference, his patience being exhausted and his feelings
having undergone an entire change towards them.
Throw then these points together: we belong to distinct varieties of the human race, with the superiority on
our side; a superiority rendered more apparent by the
relation which we sustain to them as masters, and more
real, both to them and us, when we become managers;
and shall we be in no danger of cherishing, it may be,
of cherishing unconsciously, a disrespect, if not a con-tempt for the Negroes, which may influence us to sink
them lower in the scale of intelligence, morality and religion, than in truth and justice they should be?
A third disadvantage is our latent, and in many instances manifest disinclination to the full disclosure of
the moral aud religious condition of the Negroes.
The disinclination is in proportion to the use proposed
to be made of the facts of the case, and arises from several causes.
One ispride. There are citizens in the free States

tirely false coloring to the moral character and prospects of the free Negroes among them, in order to support some favorite theory, or to shield the impotency of
their own efforts, or themselves, from the ancient reproach " what do ye more than others? Physician heal
thyself. "
In the South we spiritedly repel the charge of the injustice of the present constitution of society, by referring
our opponents to the sacred scriptures, which afford us
their support, and to the argument drawn from expediency
and necessity. On the charge of inhumanity we appeal
to the ample provision of food and clothing; to the
attention paid to the sick and the aged; to the lightness
of the labor and the punishments; and to the good health,
the spirits, and increase of the people in question. We
compare their physical comfort and the amount of labor
which they perform, with that of the laboring classes in
England and on the continent of Europe and elsewhere,
and we do not suffer at all by the comparison.
But when the charge of their intellectual and moral
degradation is preferred against us, we are inclined to
put the best face on affairs, knowing that this is the
darkest feature and the most vulnerable point. We discover this feeling in the class of factory and land owners
in England, whose statements on the moral condition of
their operatives cannot be taken but with many grains
of allowance. They would not have it known to what
an ignorant and degraded race of operatives they are
indebted for the comforts and conveniences of their
lives as individuals, and for whatever of prosperity they
enjoy as corporations or communities.
But we are wrong, decidedly wrong. The moral and
religious condition of the Negroes, is that subject which

above all others, as a Christiain people, we shotuld desire
most thoroughly to ilvestigate and understand; anid the
truth cominlg from whatever quiarter, will do us no harm,
provided we allow it to have its proper effect lupon us.
Another cause is the fear of investigation itself, and
of the consequences to whichl it may lead.
The South, in view of the excitemenlt on tlhe general
condition of tile Negroes, in the Nortli and West, hlas
become sensitive.  We Ihave been thrown from necessity
into an attitudte of self-defence, and our stretngth consists
in our union.  Hence the public minid exercises a sleepless vigilance, that it may detect, either firoii abroad or
origi,iatitig at lome, any sentiments or opinions hostile
to our social constitution.  There is less discussion, aind
less freedom of discutssion, thalt in Iby-gone diys.  Wliat
we once bore from ourselves, is witil difficulty borne now.
That man runtis the risk of losing popular favor whose
candi(l stateme,nts an,d aplpeals, designed to do good at
home, are seized upont with avidity, and perverted and
made niatter of accusation agai,nst us from abroad. lIe

involved, sliould lie speak, lie will " ask wisdom of God

Many are disposed to let all thing(s continue as they

cares, new troubles, new duties, new expenses array
theniselves before us, and %we recoil from  thenm all.
Changes are inconvenient, even   from  bad to good.
Masters find it difficult to elevate their servants in their
regards after they have for so long a time been depressed:
To change their general course of' treatment would be
virtually acknowledging to them afnd to all the world that
they have been in error; that they have not placed them
as high in the scale of intellectual and moral being as
they should have done; in short, that they have not done
them justice. Humility atnd self-denial are demanded,
but it is not easy to exercise thlese graces towards iniferiors
and dependents. Masters see, as they suppose, in all
this, a lowering down of opinions, character, a!nd dignity.
They think that they shall lose respect and authority -
the change will certainly inflate their servants, foster a
spirit of eqluality and disobedience, and in the end be
productive of no good.
There are otlhers again, to whom the quiestion recurs,
how far may we proceed in the religiois instruction of
the Negroes vitllout endangering our interests, oursafety,
and our support?  Say tliey, we knrow not when we
begin to do what may be l,ecessary in the premises,
where we shall end or how. It will be hard to close the
door after it is once opened. We may safely confide in
those who undertake the work now; but what security
have we that their successors shall be men of like character? Jt is better, therefore, to cease from the matter
before it be meddled with. Their moral and religious
condition may not be as bad as some would have us
believe. We have been doing well in times past; apply
then the adage to the case in hand, "let well alone."
10
109RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
A fourth and last disadvantage, is the difficulty oj
-obtaininig an inisight into the Negro character.
Persons live and die in the midst of Negroes aind know
comparatively little of their real character. They have
not the immediate management of them. They have to
do with them in the ordiniary discharge of their duty as
servants; further than this they institute no inquiries -
they give themselves no trouble. The Negroes are a
distinct class in community, and keep themselves very
much to themselves. They are one tling before the
whites, and another before their own color. Deception
towards the fornmer is characteristic of them, whether
bond or free, throughout the whole United States. It is
habit -a long established custom, which descends from
generation to generation. There is an tipper and an
under cutrrent. Some are contented with the appearance
on the surface; others dive beneath.  Hence tl-e diversity of inpyressions and representations of the moral and
religious condition of the Negroes. Hence the disposition of some to deny tthe darker pictures of their more
searching and knlowing friends.
Besides all this, the moral perceptions of men differ~
the eye of one nima is " single," and the eye of another
man is " evil."  What this esteems bad that considers to
be very good.
Nor have all the same opportunity of assisting their
judgernent by comparison. A man may greatly aid
himself in attaining a correct opinioIn of the moral and
religious condition of the Negroes in the Unite(d States,
and especially of those in the slave States, by becoming
from observation acquainted with the moral and religious
condition of other masses of laborers, in other States
and countries. It is not good to Ineasure ourselves by''10HMORAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.
ourselves. One opportunity of faithful comparison, will
shed more light and carry more conviction into the mind,
ofttimes, than volumes of facts and argutents. The
only danger to be apprehended from such comparisons,
is that, becoming acquainted with thlat which is worse,
we may rest satisfied with that which is bad.
Here then are obvious disadvantages to be encountered
in an inquiry into the moral arnd religious coiidition of
the Negroes. The first, our intimate knowledge of their
degraded character; the second, our belonging to a
different variety of the hunman family and sustaining
towards them the relation of superiors; the third, our
disinclination to a full disclosure of' their moral and
religious condition, arising from several causes; and the
fourth, the difficulty of obtaining an insight into the
Negro character. They must be borne in mind in the
progress of the inqutiry. In regard to the Inoral and
religious condition of the Negroes we, especially of the
South, call have no just reason for remaining in igtorance
and inactivity. The subject involves our accountability
to them and for thermn, which we shall surely meet in that
world where all eartlily distinctions are at an end; and it
involves their own eternal wvell-being, than whicil nothing
canl be more valuable to them. Every sober and reflecting
mind should be impressed with the importance and
solemnity of the inquiry.
11Ii I     RELIGIOUYS INSTRUCTION OF,THE NEGROES.
CHAPTER I1.
Circuimstances of the Negroes which affect their Moral and Religious
Condition.
The character of a people may be gathered from their
circumstances. A consideration therefore of the circum -
stances in which we find our Negro population, is a
necessary and preparatory step to the inquiry we have in
hand.
1. The circumstacnces of the Slave Population.
As habits of virtue and vice are formed, anld character
shaped, at a very early age, I shall beginl with -
The Negro in his Childhood. --The formation of
good character depends upon family government and
training; upon religious instruction, private and public;
access to the Scriptures and other sources of intellectual
and moeal iinprovement; tile character of associates;
modesty of clothing, and general mode of living.
If %we take the mass of the slave population, properly
speaking, we shall find but little famzly government,
and for the reason that parents are not qualified,neither are
they so circumistanced as to be able to fiulfil perfectly the
duties devolving upon them as such. In the more iitelligeuit and piouts families, the children are taugl;t to say
their prayers,, to go to churchb on the $abbath, to attendMORAL A'ND RELIGIOUS CONDITONo.
evenling prayers on the plant;tion, and a few simple;
rules of goodl con(luct and manners. The majority of
church members, come short of this. The mnoral train.
ing of their chiildren forms but a small part of their
effort in the family. There is not one family irn a thousand in which family prayer is observed morning and
evening. Prayers are held in some families morning
and evening on the Sabbath (lay; in others in the evening
of every day. But a general nieeting of all the members of tile church as well as of worldly persons, for
prayer in the evening on plantations, conducted by
some prominent person among them, takles the place of
family worship- the plantation is considered one large
family. To this meeting chil(lren are r.equiredl to come
or not, as the case may be. The hour is usually so late
that mnost of the chilldren have retired for the night. If
such is the state of religious families what must be the
state of those which are irreligious?  In multitudes of
families, both by precept and example, the children are
trained up in iniquity;. taught by their parents to steal,
to lie, to. deceive; nor can the rod of correction induce
a confession or revelation of their clearly ascertained
transgressions. Virtue is not cherished nor protected
in them. Parents put their children to use as early as it is
possible, and their discipline mainly respects omissions
of duty in the householdl;. moral delinquencies are
passed by;- anti that discipline owes its chief efficiency
to excited passion, and consequently exists in the extreme
of laxity or severity. They ofttimes when under no
restraint, beat their children unmercif~ully.
As to direct religious instruction, we hIave seen that
the amount communicated in families is small. The
Negroes on plantations sometimes appoint one of. their;

or in towns and villages, for colored children and youth,.
and do maintain them: from year to year? To all these
questions it must in candor be replied that the numbers
are small compared with the whl-ole.
Shall we speak of public instruction such as is communicated by a preached Gospel?  Negro children do
not enjoy the advantages of a preached Gospel; for the
custom is, where no effort is made to alter it, for the
children to remain at home on the Sabbath. Multitudes
never having been taughlt to " remember the Sabbath
day to keep it holy,"' consider it in the light, purely, ofMORAL AND, R'ELIGIOUS CONDITION.

distance to the house of wvorship is frequently considerable, too considerable for the atten(lance of small children; parents do not like the trouble of children; and,
in, short, should their children accompany them, the
services being condlucted for the most part for the special
benlefit of masters, do them no good, being above not
only their comprehension, hut even that of their parents.
Shall we speak of access to the Scriptures? The
statutes of our respective slave States foibid all knowledge of letters to tile Negroes; and where the statutesdo not custom does. It is impossible to form an estimate of the number of Negroes that read. My belief
is that the proportion would be expressed by an almost
inconceivable fraction. The greatest number of readers
is found in and about towns and cities, and among the
free Negro population, some two or three generations
removed from servitude. There are perhaps in all the
larger cities in the South, schools for the education of
colored children, supported chiefly by the free Negroes,.
and kept generally in the shade. On the one hand,.
therefore, the Negro chil(lren cannot be "hearers of the
hw," for oral instruction is but sparingly afforded to the
mass of them; and on the other,, thev cannot "' search
the Scriptures," for a knowledge of letters they have
not, and legally, they cannot obtain.
With whom is the yotung Negro associated? With
children no better instructed and disciplined than himself,
and the whole subjecte(d to the pernicious examples of'
the adults. They are favored, with no association calctulated to elevate and refine.
Negroes, especially the children, are exceedingly
inattentive to;the preservation of their clothing.. The;

lhabits, in the particular of dress, of their forefathers
from Afirica still cleave to them, especially in the warmer
seasons of the )year, when thiey are left to themselves.
This very improvi(lence on the part of the Negroes
presents an, increase of expen(liture on the part of
owners for clothing. The waste is great. And in(eed,
once for all, I will here say, that the wastes of the system are so great, as well as the fluctuations in prices of
staple articles for market, that it is difficult, nay, impossible, to inldulge in large expenditures on plantations
and make them sa'vingly profitdble.
Their general mode of living is coarse and vulgar.
Many Negro houses are small, low to the ground, blackened with smoke, often with dirt floors, anti the furniture
of the plainest kind. On some estates tlle houses are
framed, weather-boarded, neatly w}hite-washed, and
made suffliicntly large and comfortable in every respect.
The imp rovement in the size, material, and finish of
Negro houses is extendling. Occasionally they may be
founrd constructed of tabhy or brick.
A. room. is partitioned off for a sleeping appartment
and store-room, though houses are found destitute of
this convenience.  In such (Iwellings piivacy is impossible; and we may in a manner say that families live,
sleep, andl grow up together; their habits and manners
being coarse and rude. Some owners makle additions
to the houses according to the nurnber and age of the
children of families.
Having now considered the circumstances of the
Negro (luring his childhood, we may proceed and con.
sider the circumstances ofThle Negro at Adult agc.-He lives in a house

youth. He has the necessary and annual provision made
for his wants; associates with fellow-servants of like
character to his own. The seeds of virtue or vice sown
in his youth, now blossom and bear fruit. He marries
and settles in life, his children grow up around him and
trea(l in his footsteps, as he did in tile footsteps of his
father before him.
The remarks onl the religious instruction of children
apply with equal correctness to adults. Stated religiolus
instruction of adlults on. plantations, cornmunicated by
masters, ministers, or missionaries employed for the
purpose, taking the slave States togetlier, is not of frequent occurrence.  The chief privilege enjoyed by
thousands on plantations is erening prayers, co)ndtlcted
by themselves. If the intlividuals upon whom the conduct of the evening meetinig devolves are able to read,
a ihapter in the Bible is read; a hymn is reatl andt given
out and sung; followed with prayer. If they cannot
read, then a brief exhortation in place of the Scriptnles
founded, it may be, on some remembeied( passage, then
a hymn from memory an(d prayer. There are thlousands
also, who, although freely allowe(l the privilege, (ldo not
embrace it, either from want of inclination, or of suitable persons to condluct the meetings. It is matter of
thankfLulness that the owners are few in number, indlced,
who forbid religious meetings on tlheir plantations, held
either by their servants themselves, or by competent
and approved white instructors or ministers.  " All men
have not faith."  I have never known servants forbi(ddetn
to attend the worship of God on the Sabbath day, except
as a restraint temporarily laid, for some flagrant misconduct.
On special occasions, such as fast days, communion
17118     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
seasons, and protracted meetings, a (lay or more is
allowed servants by many masters.  Throughout the
slave-holdling States the rest of the Sabbath is secured
to the Negroes, and on this (lday they lave extensive
opportunities of attending divine worship, in town and
country. But it is well known to those wvho have attentively observed the habits of this people, thlat large
ntnmbers of adults remain at home or spend the day in
visiting or in ways still more exceptionable. Various
causes conspire to produce the effect. For instance;
it is their day of rest; the (listance which they must
walk to church is considerable; the accommodations for
seats, in certain cases, are limited; the services of the
sanctuary are too clevate(l for them; they are not
required or encouraged to go; they have no exalte(d
ideas of the importance of religion, and in common with
all men, are naturally disinclined to it, and are easily
satisfied with excuses for the neglect of it; and other
causes which might be mentioned. Many, in settlements
that are and that are not supplied with Gospel ministrations, live anti die without an adequate linowledge of the
way of salvation.
Nor can the atdult Negro acquaint ]himself with duty
and the way of salvation through the reading of the
Scriptures, any more than canl the child. Of those
that do read, but few read well enough for the edification of the hearers. Not all the colore(l prcachcrs read.
T'wo otller circumstances which have considerable
bearing on the moral anti religious character of the
Negroes deserve attention. The first is that the marriage state is not protected by law. Whatever of protectiotn it enjoys is to be attributed to custom, to the
conscientious eflorts of owners, and the discipline antiMORAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.
doctrines of the churches; and also the correct principle
and virtue of the contracting parties.  But the relation
is liable to disruption in a variety of forms, for some of
which there is no remedy. The second is that the government to wvhich they are subjected is too much physical in its niatu're. To discar(l an appeal to the principle
of fear-- the -fear of punishment of the person of the
transgressor in some form or other, would be running
contrary to all governments in existence, both human
and divine. While the necessity is admitted, yet the
appeal should be made as seld(om as possible and in the
mildest form consistent with the due support of atuthority
and the reformation of the tranlsgressor. Man has a
spiritutal as well as an animal nature, an(d corrective
influences, should be brought to bear upon that directly
and in the first instance, as soon as he is able to discern
between good an(l evil.
Such then are the circumstances of the slave population, which have an unfavorable influence upon their
moral and religious con(lition. Those circumstances
only have been referred to which pronminently assist us
in our inquiry. In conclusion it may be added that servants have neither intellectual nor moral intercourse with
their masters generally, sufficient to redeem theim fr,om
the adverse influence of the circums:ances alluided to;
for the two classes are (listinct in their association, and
it cannot well be otherwise. Nor have servants any redeeming intercourse with any other persons. On the
contrary in certain situations there is intercourse had
with them, and many teml:tations laid before them against
whiici tlhey have little or no defence, and the effect is
deplorable.

2. I he circumnstances of the firee Negro population,
The free Negro population is about equally (livi(led
between the free and the slave states; the balance may
be somewhat in favor of the slave states.
Their locations are chiefly in cities, towns and villages; thley are but thinly scattered throughotut the country. Unless diverted by some uncontrolable circumstance
they invariably fin(l their way into cities, partly because
thley there find most society of their own color, and
pairtly because they malke out to live at less expense of
laborr: have the means an(d opportunities of vicious indulgence more at hand, witl less (langer of detection,
and in every respect are under less supervision and restrain t.
Their station in society as wvell as their condition, is
one of inJfe-riority. Their freeldom consists mainly, in
deliverance fiom conzpulsory labor. The real estate
ownedl by them  taki;.g the whole population, is very
trifling: tlieir personal property is something greater;
but as a class thley are poor.
Ilere and there one may be foiun(d cultivating his own
lantl for a stipport, btut the mass, are hired servants:wvaiters in private and public houses, stewards andl cooks
and common handls on board steam boats, alnd merchant
vessels: some few on board men of war: mechanics,
tradesm-en: shop lieepers, porters, Iraymrnen: hour and
day laborers: " hewers of wootl and d(rawers of water."
Multitut(les have no visible means of living: no support
but that of vice.
They usually occtipy some particular quarter of the
town, abandfoned to them, with the exception of certain
poor and( (legraded white families andt shop keepers.
The houses which they occupy are built cheaply for thaMORAL N)' RELIGIOUS CONDITION,
poorer class of rentelrs; anti when of suifficient size, will
sometimes accommeod(te fr'om two to six fdmilies.  On
a personal inspection of the entire Negro quarters of
one of the chief towns in the Northern states, I found
white ftamilies mixed in with the black, a most motly assemblage: whole families, sometimes takling in boarders,
lodged in one room, wiLhout partitions or screens. Their
furnitllre coarse and scanty, and so was their every day
clothing in which I foirind them. There were no gardens
cultivated, where ground was accessible.  There were
no visible conlfor'ts: all thiings wore the appearance of
poverty, improvidence, idleness, drunklenness and debau,
chery. They seemned to live, literally, " fiom hand to
mouth; " and to work onily in obedience to stern necessity. There w-ere a few, and but a few, creditable ex,
ceptions.
The conveniences and comforts to be found in theit
dwellings, the boluntifiulness of their diet and clothing,
the number of frietnds which they haye, or canl command
in seasons of sickness and sufffering, all depend upon their
own industry anld uprighltness of character. That character being generally bad, their physical condition is
bad also. This is the testilmony of all who have made
observations on tlie condition of tlhe firee  Negroes
in the free states. Their physical condition in the slave
states, on the whilole, is decidedly in advance of what it is
in the free states. Trhere are more free colored families
in the slave than in the free states: in the latter the young
cannot marry, the support of a family, especially through
the rigors of winter being difficult; and consequently
numbers of youth, abandon themselves to profligacy.
Their advantages for education, and consequently ac~
cess to the written word oJ God, are more limited in the

Moral and Religious Condition of the Negroes in the United Stateos
We have refered to the disadvantages under which
we labor for prosecuting o.ur inquiry, and also, to the
circumstances in which wve find our Negro population.
These preparatory st.eps being taken, we- nay now come
intelligently, and with less surp)rise at the results, to a
consideration of their actual noral and religious condition.
As to moral and religious character, the Negroes are
naturally ilwhat all other rmen are. No attempt, tllerefore, will be made either to show that they are more
depraved than another people would be in like circum.
stances, or to. show that they are the most dcgraded of
all people on the earth. To attempt the establishment
of one or botli these positions would argue contempt of
the truth. It is my wish to present the truth on the
subject, derived from observation and other sources;
believing that nothiing more,, and nothing less, is required
by the importa.nce of it.tBORItAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITIONL
1. The Mloral and Religious Condition of the Slave
Negro Population.
Ignorance of the doctrines and duties of Christianity,
is prevalenlt among tlhe Neg roes.
Their notions of the Supreme Being; of the cliaracter
and offices of Christ and of the Holy Ghost; of a future
state; and of what constitutes holiness of life, are indefinite and confused. Some brought up in a Christian land,
and in the vicinity of the house of God, have heard
of Jesus Christ; but who he is, and what he has done
for a ruined world, they cannot tell. The Mohatnmedar
Africans remaining of the old stoclk of imlportations,
although accustomed to hear the Gospel preached, have
been known to accommodate Christianity to Mohammedanism. " God," say they, " is Allah, and Jesus Christ
is Mohammed--the religion is the same, but different
countries have different names."
The number of professors of religion, in proportion to,
the whole, is not large, that can present a correct view
of the plan of salvation; although in many instances
where they fail to do so, it is but just to observe, that
their knowledge is greater than one not familiiarly acquainted with thetn would coticeive it to be. It exceeds
their power of expression; since from the want of education and practice, they are unable to state accurately
and readily their own views and feelings.
True religion they are inclined to, place in profession,
in forms and ordinances, and in excited states of feeling.
And true conversion, in dreams, visions, trances, voices -
all bearing a perfect or striling resemblance to some
form or type whichl has been handed down for generations,
or which has been originated in the wild fancy of some
1;1*
l'252:~6~' RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
religious teacher among them. These dreams an(d visions
they will offer to church-sessions, as evidences of conversion, if encouraged so to do, or if their better instruction be neglected. Sometimes principles of conduct are
adopted by church members at so much variance with
the Gospel that the 1" grace of God is turned into lasciviousness."  For example, members of the same church
are sacredly bound by their religion not to ieveal each
others sins, for that would be backbiting and injuring
the brotherhood. And again, that which would be an,
abominable sin, committe(l by a church member with a,
worldly person, becomes no sin at all if committed with
another church member. The brethren must'-bear one
another's burdens and so fllfi-l the law of Chlrist."
All the various perversions of the Gospel are to be
mret with, an(I more than probable, pushed to extremes.
Antinomianism is not uncommon, and at times, in its
worst forms. " Christ," is made " the minister of sin'
-the christian is safe, do what he may.
To know the extent of their ignorance even where
they have been accustomed to the sound of the Gospel
in white churches, a man should make investigation for
himself-the result will frequently surprise and fill him
with grief. They scarcely feel shame for their ignorance
on the subject of religion, although they may have hadabundant opportunity of becoming wiser. Ignorance,
they seem to feel, is their lot; and that feeling is intirmately associated with another, every way congenial to
the natural man, namely, a feeling of irresponsibilityignorance is a cloak and excuse for crime. Some white
rainisters and teachers, in their simplicity, beholding
their attention to the preaching of the Gospel, adapted
t9 their comprehension, and hearing the expressions ofI-ORAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.
their thankfulness for the pains taken for tlheir instruction, come to the conclusion that they are an unsophis--
ticated race; that they form one of the easiest and
pleasantest fields of labor in the world; and that they are
a people " made ready, prepared for the Lord;"- nothing
more being necessary than to carry them the Gospel
and converts will be multiplied as drops of morning dew,
yea, a nation will be born in a day.
Experiment shortly dissipates these visions, and well
is it if the sober reality does not frighten the laborer
away in disgust and disappointment. He who carries
the Gospel to them encounters depravity, intrenched in
ignorance, both real and pretended. He beholds the
Scripture fulfilled, " having the understanding darkened,
being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their
hearts."- Eph. 4, 17-19. He discovers (leism, skepticism, universalism.  As already stated, the various,
perversions of the Gospel, and all the strong objections,
against the truth of God; objections which he may
perhaps have considered peculiar only to the cultivated
minds, the ripe scholarship and profound intelligence, of
critics and philosophers! Extremes here meet on the
natural and common ground of a darkened understanding
and a hardened heart. He is convinced that there is "a
spirit which ruleth in the hearts of the children of disobedience." " They are wise to do evil; but to do good
they have no knowledge."
Intimately connected with their ignorance, is their
su,perstition.
They)believe in second-sight, in apparitions, cllarms,
witchcraft, and in akind of. irresistible Satanic influence.
The superstitions brought.from Africa have not been,
1271238 RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.,
wholly laid aside. Ignorance an(I superstition render
them easy (lupes to their teachers, doctors, prophets,
conijurers; to artfull and designing men. When fitirly
cominitted to such lea(lers, they may be brought to the
commission of almost any crime. Facts in their history
prove this. On certain occasions they have been made
to believe that while tliey carried about their persons
some charm with which they had been filrnished, they
were invulnerable. They have, on certain other occasions, been made to believe that they were under a protection that rendered them invincible. That they might
go any where and do any thing they please(l, and it
would be impossible for them to be discovere(l or linown;
in fine, to will was to do -safely, successfuilly. They
have been lknown to be so perfectly and fearfully under
the influence of some leadler or conjurer or minister,
that they have not dared to disobey him in the least particular; nor to (lisclose their own inten(led or perpetrated crimes, in viewv of inevitable death itself; notwithstanding all other influences broughit to bear upon them.
Their superstition is made gain of by the conjurersand
others like them.  They are not only imposed and
practiced upon to their lhurt, by these more prominent
characters, but by each other more privately, by " tricking," as it is called, for the gratification of revenge, or
of lust, or of covetousness. A plain and faithlfil presentation of the Gospel, usually weakens if not destroys
these superstitions.
7'heir sense of obligation to improve religious privileges is seriously defective.
Necessarily so,. both with the church and th! world,
because they have never enjoyed to any great extent,
early religious.training. It is; a matter depending prettyMORAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.o
much upon the contingencies of the day or the hour
whether they attend the house of God on the Sabbath
or the meeting for prayer on the plantation. One of the
fiIst efforts of the Minister or MIissionary shouldl be to
create a sense of obligation in respect to this very thing.
to enligliten their consciences, and bring them to feel
that they are responsible for the due improvement of their
privileges; and that the members of the church shouldl
be foremost in meeting that responsibility. They will
noow and then excuse their remissness, by pleadirig that
their leisure is needed for rest: or that they have no
time: that it is hard for thlem to serve their earthly and
heavenly master too. It is but an excuse, for the Negroes in the Soutlh, in general, fall short at the least one
third of what free white laborers perform.  Yet as
power may be, and sometimes is abused, we should look
well to it, that by our exactions and treatmeiit, we may
not prevent our people from enteringin to the kingdom,
of heaven.
They have but a poor standard of vmoral character,
and are indifferent to the general corruption of manners that prevails around them.
Which is a strong evidence of their moral, degradation:
for a public sentiment in respect to various vices and
improper customs, perva(les with considerable force all
societies advanced in some good degree in piety and,
virtue.
The standard of moral claracter is much higher among
the members of the church, than among those who are
not, but it is not by any means, what it mightand ought
to be. They say and do an(d tolerate what is plain evidence that their standard is low. T'o aspire to or hope
for as elevated a morality as obtains among the whites
129130    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGCROES.
they think, can neither be expected, nor required of them.
With the people of thie world there is scarcely any
standar(I of moral character, strictly speaking, at all.
They seem to feel that they have very little to gain or
lose either way they turn.
They talie little interest in the moral improvement of
their own color.'rhey live not together as communities having common ties and interests whiclh would
prompt them to promote the public piety an(l virtue, but
very mutch as indelendent indlividtials and families.
Such a thing as their unitillg to suppress any particular
vice, or to promote any good object, has not been known
among them, it' we except a few Temperance societies
formed of late years. They regar(l not the evil influlence which they may exert over their neighbor, nor the
injury which they may do him ill his character, in his
family, or property, it' their lust or malice or avlarice be
gratified.
They follow their own inclinations and intelests, having respect t.) consequences mainly, as they may bring
them into collision with the laws an(l regulations of thic
plantation or household.  Should they escape the master, the (ifficulties with their own color will be easily
adjus'edl, if cared for at all.
But the Negroes are scrupulous on one point; they
make c,ommon cause, as serlvailts, in concealinlr their
faults from their owners. I[lquiry elicits no infornmation;
no one feels at liberty to (lisclse the transgressor; all
are profounidly ignoranit; the matter asstimes the sacredness of a " prlofessional secret:" f,,r they remember
that they may herealfter requtire the same concealment

their names cast oult as evil fr,om aimong their brethren,
anti being suibjecte(l to) scorn, and( perhaps personal violence or01 pecullary injur-y.
ThIe frequency of church, discipline antd the character
of the crimes requiring it, cast light upo0: their inoral
an(I religious colldliti,on.
The (liscipline of colored menlbers is involvedl, telious,
vexatious andl ilisgusitilg.  Many cases worthy of (liscipline never appear for it, because, at one time, they are
secretly hushe(l lip, and at another, testimony canriot be
procuredl, as they avoid, if' it be possible, becoming
accusers or witnesses.  Excomm unications, however,
anrd suspensions are of perpetiual oc.currence, for crimes
shocking inr character, at(nd of themselves sufficient to
show the general state of morals; sulch for example as
a(lultery, fornication, theft, lying, drunkenness, quarreling, antl fighting.  The first three are their most conmmon vices. Out-breaking sins oiily are taken in lhand.
Their bitterness, wrath, clamor, evil-speaking, attld profanity are seldom  Ioticed, and for the reason that all
plasses awvay ith the breath, and no niman has his ftamily

the whites possibly can hlave. Yet when we consider
that the Negroes are brought up in ignorance of religion
in multitudes of instances; subjected ofttimes to the
incompetent teachings of men of their own color; the
preaching and instruction in white chuichles above their
comprehlension; no access directly to the word of life;
surrounded with depraved society; subjected to maniifold temptations; destitute to a considerable extent of
encouragement in ways of righteousness; and a life of
active employment, I apprellend that our surprise will
be, not that there are so many spurious conversions and
so m2any defections, but that there are so few; and moreover, that in judging their Christian character, charity
demands that we should consider their condition and
-circumstances and make very great allowances. Hence

Violations of the marriage contract.
The divine institution of marriage depends for its
perpetuity, sacredness, and value, largely upon the pro.
tection given it by the law of the lan(d. Negro marriages
are neither recognized nor protected by law.  The
Negroes receive no instruction on the nature, sacredness,
and perpetuity of the institution; at any rate they areMORAL AND RELIGIOUS'CONDITION.
far from being duly impressed with these things. They
are not required to be married in any particular foxrm,
nor by any particular persons. Their ceremonies are
perfornmed by their own watchmen or teachers, by some
white minister, or as it firequently happens, not at all
the consent of owners and of the parties immediately
interested, and a public acknowledgment of each other,
being deemed sufficient.
There is no special disgrace nor punishment visited
upon those who criminally violate their marriage vows,
except wvhat may be inflicted by owners, or, if the parties
be members, by the church in the way of suspension
and excommunication,
Families are and may be divided for improper condluct
on the part of eithler husband or wvife, or by necessity,
as in cases of the death of owners, division of estates,
debt, sale, or removals, for they are subject to all the
changes and vicissitudes of property. Such divisions
are, however, carefully guarded against and prevented,
as far as possible, by owners, on the score of interest,
as well as of religion and humanity.
Hence, as may well be imagined, the marriage relation
loses much of the sacredness and perpetuity of its
character. It is a contract of convenience, profit, or
pleasure, that may be entered into and dissolved at the
will of the parties, and that without heinous sin, or the
injury of the property or interests of any one. That
which they possess in common is speedily divided, and
the support of the wife and children falls not upon the
husband, but upon the master. Protracted dickness,
want of industrious habits, of congeniality of disposition,
or disparity of age) are sufficient grounds for a separation. While there are creditable instances of conjugal

fidelity for a long series of years, and until death; yet
infidelity in the marriage relation and dissolution of
marriage ties are not uncommon.
On account of the cllanges, interruptions and interferences in families, there are quarrelings and fightings,
and a considerable item in the management of plantations
is the settlement of family troubles.  Some owners
become disgusted and wearied out, and finally leave
their people to their own way; while others cease from
the strife ere it be med(lled with, and give it as an opinion that the less the interference on the part of the
master the better. A few conscientious masters persevere in attempts at reformation, and with some good
degree of success.
Polygamy is practised both secretly and openly; in
some sections where the people have been well instructed
it is scarcely known; in others, the crime has diminished
and is diminishing; it is to be hoped universally so. It
is a crime which among all people and under all circuinstances, carries, in its perpetration, vast inconveniences
and endless divisions and troubles: and they are felt by
the Negroes as well as by others, and operate as a great
preventive.  Polygamy is also discountenanced and
checkled by the majority of owners, and by the churches
of all denominations.
Uncleanness. - The sin may be considered universal.
The declaration will be sufficient for those who have any
acquaintance with this people in the slave-holding States
or in the free States; indeed, with the ignorant laboring
classes of people wherever they may be found. It is
not my object to institute comparisons, if it were, I could
point to many tongues and people, in civilizedl governments, upon the same level of depravity with the Negroes,MORAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.
The sin is not viewed by them as by those of higher
intelligence and virtue, so that they do not consider
character as lost by it, nor personal degradation as necessarily connected with it. A view which, however it
may spring from vitiated principle, preserves the guilty
from entire prostration.
Intimately connected with this view is the crime of
Infanticide:-a crime restrained in good measure by
the provision made for the support of the chil(l on the
part of the owner, by the punishment in case of detection, and by the moral degradation of the people that
takes away the disgrace of bastardly.
Theft.- They are proverbially thieves. They bear
this character in Africa; they have borne it in all countries whither they have been carried; it has been the
character of slaves in all ages, whatever their nation or
color. They steal from each other; from their masters
from any body. Cows, sheep, hogs, poultry, clothing;
yea, nothing goes amiss to which they take a fancy;
while corn, rice, cotton, or the staple productions, whatever they may be, are standing temptations, provided a
market he at hand, and they can sell or barter them with
imptunity. Locks, bolts, and bars secure ar ticles desirable to them, from the dwelling of the master to that of
the servant, and the keys, must always be carried.
Falsehood. - Their veracity is nominal. Duplicity
is one of the most prominent traits in their character,
practiced between themselves, but more especially towards their masters and managers., Their frequent
cases of feigned sickness are vexatious. When criminal
acts are under investigation, the sober, strenuous falsehood, sometimes the direct and awful appeal to God, of
the transgressor,. averts the suspicion, and by his own,

tact or collusion with others, perhaps, fixes the guilt
upon some innocent person. The number, the variety
and ingenuity of falsehoods that can be told by them in
a few brief moments, is most astonishing.  Where
opportunity is given they will practice imposition. Servants, however, who will neither steal nor lie, may be
found, and in no inconsiderable numbers.
Qiuarreling and Fighting. - The Negroes are settl'ed
in some quarter of the plantation, in houses near each
other, built in Iows, for ming a street. Tile custom is to
give each famity a house of its own. The Ilouses some,
times have a partition in the middle and accommodate a
family in each end. These are called double-houses.
Living so near each other, and every day worlking
together, causes of difference must necessarily arise.
Families grow jealous and envious of their neighbors;
some essay to be leading families; they overhear conversations and domestic disagreements; become privy
to improper conduct; they (lepredate upon each other;
a fruitftll source of tumult is the pilfering and quarreling
of children which involve their parents. The wvomen
quarrel more than the men, and fight oftener. Where
no decisive measures are taken to suppress these practices, plantations sometimes become intolerable, might
gives right; the strong opplress the weak. Every master
or manager has the evil under his own control.
They come to open breaclhes too, with their neighbors
on adjoining plantations, or lots, if they live in towns.
The Sabbath is considered a very suitable day for the
settlemnent of their difficulties. However, with truth it
may be said, there are fewer personal injutries, and
manslaughiers, and murders among the Negroes in the
South, than among the same amount of population in
any part of the United States; or, perhaps, in the world.137
MOIrAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.
Insensibility of Heart. - An ignorant and degraded'
people are not wont to exhibit much of the milk of
human kindness.
Unless the Negroes are carefully watched and made
accountable for power lodged in their hands, it will be
abused. Parents will beat their children, husbandls their
wives, master-mechanics their apprentices3 and drivers
the people. In sickness, parents will neglect their chil -
dren, children their parents; and so with the other social
relations. They cannot be trusted as nurses.. Ience
they must be made to attend upon the sick, and then.
watched lest they neglect them; which ultimately brings
the whole care of the sick u1pon the master or manager.
It is a saying of their own, "that white people care
more for them than their own color;" and again, " that
black people have not the same feeling for each other
thtat white people have."  It is an indisputable fact that
when Negroes become owners of slaves they are generally cruel masters. They will over-load, work-down,
bruise and beat, and starve all working animals committed to their care, with careless indifference.
Profane Swearing-- is indulgedc in by both men and
women; and in certain districts to a most fearful extent.
The vile habit is not so much under the notice of masters as some others, because servants restrain thernselves
in their presence and hearing, so that a plantation may
be notorious for its profanity and the owner be ignorant
of the fact. With profane swearing may be connected
their vulgar and obscene conversation, songs, and jests,
which tend to the early ruin of delicacy, modesty, and
virtue.
Drunkenness -is more prevalent in towns and cities
because facilities for procuring ardent spirits are greater
12*138    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
than in country places. Drunkenness is easily detected
and rarely escapes punishment, and the Negroes stand
in fear. But immense quantities of ardent spirits are
sold in the Southern States to the Negroes, by retailing
shops, established for the express purpose of Negrotrading, wherever such trade may be secured. These
shops injure the pecuniary interests of the country;
they corrupt the morals, injure the health and destroy
the lives of many of the Negroes; and are the greatest
nuisances and sources of evil tolerated in the countryo
tIad the Negroes access to ardent spirit they would
speedily become a nation of drunkards'.
Sabbath-breaking. --From all that has been said onI
the moral and religious condition of the Negroes, it is
not necessary to enlarge on their Sabbath breaking.
If they go not to the house of God, as multitudes do not,
they spend the day in visiting, in idleness and sleep, or
in hunting, fishing, or, sometimes, in thieving or working
for their own convenience and profit; and where Sunday
markets are tolerated, in trading. The necessity for the
few Sunday markets which may exist, is laid in the
cupidity and selfishness of those in authority; and the
deeper condemnation of the iniquity will be visited upon
thetn. The labor which the overwhelming mass of the
Negroes perform in the South, especially in the cotton
growiing districts, leaves them abundant time for their
own domestic affairs, if they have any disposition to
improve it. Hence the general fact that the Negroes
who keep the Sabbath, are the most thrifty and well-tolire. If a master so works his people as to compel them
in a measure to labor for themselves on the Sabbath, or
if he requires for himself any labor from them, on that
holy day, the burden of the sin is upon his shoulders;MORAL AND RELIQIOUS CONDITION.
nor can such conduct be spoken of in terms of too
severe reprobation; and it merits the attention of the
civil authorities, and the severest penalties provided in
law. But if a master be humane, and makes every
arrangement to promote the prosperity of his people, if
they will do that which they know is wrong, the bllame
is theirs and not his. There is, indeed, a limit to the
responsibility of masters, as well as of others in autliority.
I am aware that there are exceptions in favor of members of the churcll, among Negroes, and in favor of
particular parts of our country, lwherein efforts have
been made to secure a better observance of the Sabbath,
but taking the country generally, our Sabbaths are
profaned.
Our observations llave, thus far, had direct reference
to country, or plantation, Negroes, and exceptions to
our general view, are always implied if not expressed.
Variations may be discovered in their character and circumstances in different States and in different parts of
the same State.
The moral and religious condition of town and city
Negroes, mnay be disposed of in a few lines.
They admit of division into four classes: family servants, or those who belong to the families which they
serve; hired servants, or those who are hired out by
their owners to wait in families, or to any other service;
servants who hire their ownI time, and work at various
employments and pay their owners so much per day or
month; and watermen, embracing fishermen, sailors,
and boat,men.
Town and city Negroes are more intelligent and
sprightly than country Negroes, owing to a difference
in circumstances, employments, and opportunities of
139140    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
improvement. Their physical condition is somewhat
improved; and they enjoy greater access to religious
privileges.
On the other hand, they are exposed to greater temptations and vices; their opportunities of attending
upon places of pleasure and dissipation are increased;'
they have stronger temptations to theft, and idleness,:
and drunkenness, and lewdness; and the tendency to
Sabbath breaking is e,qually great. Their moral and religious condition is precisely that of plantation Negroes,
modified in some respects and aggravated in others, by
peculiarity of circumstances. They are more intelligent
but less subordinate; better provided for in certain particulars, but not more healthy; enjoy greater advantagesfor religious improvement, but are thrown more (lirectlv
in the way of temptation; and, on the whole, in point
of moral character, if there be any pre-eminence it is in
favor of the country Negroes; but it is a difficult point
to decide.
I shall, now, llaving brought to a close the moral and,
religious condition of the slave Negro population, present a few extracts fronm various and recent authors,,
corroborative of the view which I have taken of it.
Edwin C. Holland, Esq., in his, "' Refutation of Calumnies circulated against the Southern and Western
States:" Charleston, 1S22, says, page 59; "If it be
asked why those in the lower country are allowanced,
while those of the interior are not; the answer is, that
such are the facilities of transportation to rnarket, and
the disposition to thievery so innate to the blacks, that
a planter's barn would in a very short time become
bankrupt of its wealth, and the whole of his substance
vanish like unsubstantial moonshine."MORAL AND RELIGIOUS CONDITION.
Dr. Dalcho, of the Episcopal church, in his " Prac
tical Considerations, etc.;" Charleston, 1823, p. 6.
"Ignorant and indolent by nature, improvident and depraved by habit, and destitute of the moral principle, as
they generally appear to be, ages and generations must
pass away before they could be made virtuous, honest,
and useful members of society."
Gen. Thomas Pinckney, in his "Reflections, etc.;"
Charleston, 1822; pp. 20, 21. "Every thing consigned
to the management of the slave, who has neither the
incitement of interest, nor the fear of certain punishment, is neglected or abused; horses and all inferior
animals left to their charge are badly attended; their
provender finds its way to the dram shop, and they are
used frequently without discretion or mercy; their carriages and hartless are slightly and badly cleanedl; the
tools of the mechanics are brolien and lost through neglect; their very clothing becomes more expensive
through their carelesness arising from the knowledge
that they must be supplied with all these articles, as well
as their stubsistence, at their masters expense; and waste,
that moth of domestic establishments, universally prevails."

"There needs no stronger illustration of the doctrine
of human depravity than the state of morals on plantations in general. Besides the mischievous tendency of
bad example in parents and elders, the little Negro is
often taught by these his natural instructers, that he
may commit any vice he can conceal from his superiors,
and thus falsehood and deception are anlong the earliest

lessons they imbibe. Their advance in years is but a
progression to the higher grades of iniquity. The violation of the seventh commandment is viewed in a more
venial light than in fashionable European circles. Their
depredations of rice have been estimated to amount to
twenty-five per cent on the gross average of crops, and
this calculation was made after fifty years experience,
by one whose liberal provision for their wants left no
excuse for their ingratitude."
Thomas S. Clay, Esq., of Bryan county, Ga. " Detail
of a Plan for the Moral Improvement of Negroes
on Plantations;" 1833; pp. 8, 9; speaks of"vice and
impurity, as the inheritance, for ages, of this degraded
race," and enumerates "quarreling and fighting, lying
and indecency," among their vices.
The Honorable Whitenmarsh B. Seabrook: "Essay
on the Management of Slaves:" Charleston, 1834: pp.
7, 8, 12, &amp;c. " As human beings however slaves are
liable to all the infirmities of our nature. Ignorant and
fanatical none are niore easily excited. Incendiaries
might readily embitter their enjoyments and render them
a curse to themselves and the community." -" The
prominent offences of the slave are to be traced in most
instances to the use of intoxicating liquors. This is one
of the main sources of every insurrectionary movement

humanity, to arrest the progress of what may emphatically be called the contagious disease of our colored
population. What have become of the millions of freemen who once inhabited our widely spread country? Ask

slaves from experiencing the fate of the aborigines of
America? "- "At one time polygamy was a common
crime: it is now of rare occurrence." -" Between
slaves on the same plantation there is a deep sympathy
of feeling which binds them so closely together that a
crime committed by one of their number is seldom discovered through their instrumentality. This is an obstacle to the establishment of an e'fficient police, which
*the domestic legislator can with difficulty surmount."
The executive committee of the Kentucky Union for
the moral and religious improvement of the colored race,
in their "Circular to the ministers of the gospel in Kentucky" - 1834, say-" We desire not to represent
their condition worse than it is. Doubtless the light that
shines around them, more or less illuminates their minds
and moralizes their characters. We hope and believe
that some of them, though poor in this world's goods,
will be found rich in spiritual possessions in the day when
the King of Zion shall make up his jewels. We know
that many of thein are included in the visible church,
and frequently exhibit great zeal; but it is to be feared
that it is often' a zeal without knowledge:' and of the
majority it must be confessed, that' the light shineth in
darkness and the dar:kness comprehendeth it not.' After
making all reasonable allowances, our colored population,can be considered, at the most, but semi-heathen."''Western Luminary.

great. He may sometimes feel a reflected respect for him,

occasioned by their habits.  There seems to be an almost
entire absence of moral principle among the mass of our
colored population. But details upon this subject would
be here misplaced. To steal and not to be detected is a
merit among them, as it was with certain people in ancient times, and is at this day, with some unenlightened

With a passion for dress, they frequently spend all

they make, in fine clothes; their appearance on the Sabbath and on public days, is any thing else but an index
of their fortunes and comfort at home.  They hire
cloth iJg for set occasions if they have none sufficiently
good.
Proverbially idle, the majority work not except from
necessity, and as soon as they collect a little money they
must enjoy themselves upon it. They have beent known
to refuse employment, because not exactly out of money.
Their love of ease overcomes that of gain. This propensity to idleness exposes them to manifold temptations,
plunges them  iinto numerous vices and subjects them to
great privation and suffering.
They are amazingly improvidelnt. One melting ray

merits do better. Profane swearing, quarreling, fightizng
and -Sabbatih-breaking, are such common vices that they
require no special notice.
Drunkenness, with its attendant woes, hurries large
numbers of them to sudden and untimely ends. Low,
dark, secluded, and filthy dram shops, are favorite resorts;
often the depositories of stolen goods. I have seen thei
living upon a few crackers a day and as much whiske3
as they could procure; their life spent in idleness, nightlj
revels, drunkenness, and debauchery.

LewdlrLess is without bounds. Great numbers, both rn
the slave and free States, not otily pursue the vice, but
are trained up to it, as a meanls of livitlg.  lnfiinticide,
and the crimes and wretchedness connected witli the
vice, are found among them: the critne of infanticide is
far more common among the free Negroes in the free,
than in the slave States. Iindeed it is by no means common among the free Negroes in the slave States. Their.marriage relations too, are subject to dissolutions from
infidelity and various other causes. It is a rernarkble
fact that a large proportion of those of a marriagable
age, remain single, especially in the free States, where
the support of a farnily is difficult. This fact has a
considerable bearing on their state of Inorals.

elevated by law, this kind of population is in a worse
condition and muchl more troublesome to society than
in the slave-holding and especially in the planting States.
Ohio, some years ago, formed a sort of land of promise

"In Massachusetts they are one seventy-fourth part of

sixth of the convicts in the state prison. In Connecticut
one thirty-fourth part of the whole, one third of the
number in the penetentiary. New York one thirty-fifth
and one fourth of the convicts. New Jersey one thirteenth, and one third. Pennsylvania one thirty-fifth,
and one third. In Ohio the black population is one to
one hundred and fifteen white; convicts seven to one
hundred. Verlnont, by census of 1830, contained 277,000 souls; 918 were Negroes. In 1831 there were
seventy-four convicts in the prison, and of these twentyfour were Negroes!   When compared with what is
reported of the prisons of the slave-holding States, it is
shown that the proportion of Negroes in the penetentiaries of the free States is in the ratio of more than ten to
one in favor of the slave-holding States. * * * The

The view which has now been taken of the Moral
and Rleligioius Condition of the Negroes of tile United
States, ivill, we believe, justify us in the following general conclusions.
1. They are intellectually an(d morally a degraded
people; the most so of any in the lUnited States;-and
while from their universal profession of tile Christian
system, and their attendance upon its ordinances of
worship, and the absence of all fixed forms of i(dolatry,
they cannot, strictly speaking be termed heathen; yet
may they with propriety be ternled the heathen of our
land.
2. The majority of them have access to some kind of
means of grace, either among themselves or in connection with the whites; but they are not as efficient means
as their necessities require; while multitudes of them
are almost wholy (lestitute. Nor has the colore(l population, bondl an(I free, eitlier ability or will to supply
themselves with the Gospel of the grace of God; but
are left in inext to absolute ldependence upon the permission, the countenance and assistance of the whites.
3. They are living in manifold antid gross sins; their
iniquities are aggravated an(d great before the Lord, and
not the least of them is their neglect and contempt of
spiritual mercies an(l privileges within their reach.
Thousands are annually (lescending to the grave and
eternal misery, and they (lemand and otght to excite the
benevolent feelings and eflorts, for their salvation, of the
churches of Christ throughout the Union.

1PART III.
OBLIGATIONS of the Church of Christ to attempt the
Improvement of the Moral and Religious Condition
of the Negroes in the United States, by affording
them the Gospel.
CHAPTER I.
The Obligations of the Church to afford the Gospel to the Negroes.
There are one or two positions upon which the argument under this head is based, and as preliminary thereto
demand attention.
The Gospel is the gift of God to our lost and ruined
race. Our Divine Lord "' was made flesh " - John 1:
1 - 14. He took upon himself our nature:-Heb. 2:
11 - 18; for our benefit. That benefit is eternal life.
"In him was life, and tlle life was the light of men. -
John 1: 4, 17, 3. " For God so loved the world that
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'"--3:
16. " Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift." -
2 Cor. 9: 15.156     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIlE NEGROES.
It hlath pleased tle Alnighty, in hIis sovreignty, to
bestow the Gospel upon but a portioni of the hunian race.
He has, however, chosenr to elnmploy human agenlcy in
extendillg the knowledge, and the consequient blessings
of this glorious gift, to all mankinid, in fulfilment of his
expressed designs, anld his own most precious promises.
He has made it thleduty undtler tle most solemnr commands, of all h h1o posscss tile Gospel to impuart it to those
who are destitute of it. l'hle possession of the gift
implies the obligation to imllpart it. No main may question this position wlio allows liimself to be guided by
the conviction, of reason, the dictates of conscience, or
the declaratiotls of the wor(d of God.
In attemptiing to fulfil this duty, the general and the
just rule of action is, that we impart thle Gospel to those
of otur fellow-men \who are most dlependent upon us for it
- who are most needy and most accessible.'These tllree peculiarities meet irn the case of the
Negroes; and consequenttly they stanid Jirst in their
claims upon our benevolent attention.  And our remarks
in confirmation shall be directed,
1. To the N'egroes in the Slave States.
They are the most dependent of all people upon us for
the word of life.
A glance at the civil condition and connection of this
people with us, will deinonstrate the point. They are,
in the eye of the law, property; over whlichl there is an
absolute control as such, excepting in so far as they are
human beings, and by law are protected in life and( limb.
The law, however, makes no provision for their religious
training, and all the privileges of religion are regulated
by the customs of society and the will of owners; norOBLIGATIONS OF THPE'itiuRCH.
s it in the power of any one to interfere between the
master and the servan~t, and dictate what privileges his
servant ought and must enjoy, any niore than he may
interfere between parent and child.
Throw these facts together. By law or custom, they
are excluded from the advantages of education; and by
Iconsequence, fiom  the reading of the word of God-:
and this immense mass of immortal beings is thrown fo;i'
religious instruction upon oral communications entirely.
And upon whom?       Upon their owners.  And their
^owners, especially of late years, claim to be the exclusive
guarclians of their religious instruction, and the almoners
of divine mercy towards them, thus assuming the respon,
sibility of their entire christianization'!
All approaches to theni from abroad are rigidly guarded;against, and no ministers are allowed to break to them
the bread of life, except such as have cornmended them;.
selves to the affection and confidence of owners. I do
not condemn this course of self-preservation on the part
of our citizens. I mention it only to show more filly
the point in hand; the entire dependence of the Negroes
upon ourselves for the Gospel.
While this step is taken, another has already been
taken, and that of a long time; namely, Negro preachers
are discouraged, if not suppressed, on the ground of
incompetency and liability to abuse their office and
influence to the injury of the morals of the people and
the infringement of the laws and peace of the country.
I would not go all the lengths of many on this point, for
from my own observationj Negro preachers may be employed and confided in, and so regulated as to do their
own color great good, and community no harm: nor do I
see, -if we take the word of God for our guide, how we
14
1571BS     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
can corsistently exclude an entire people from access to
the Gospel ministry, as it may please Almighty God from
time to time, as he unquestionably does, to call some of
them to it "as Aaron was."  The discouragement of
this class of preachers, throws the body of the people
still more in their (lependence upon ourselves, who ind(eed
cannot secure ministers in sufficient numbers to supply
our owI warits.
Nor have tile Negroes any churc7h organizations differentfromn or independent of our own. Such independent
organizalions are, indeed, not on the whole a(dvisable.
But the fact binds thein to us with still stronger dependence
And, to add no more, we niay, according to the power
lodged in our hands, forbid religious meetings, and
religious instruction on our own plantations; we may
forbi(d our servants going to church at all, or only to
such churches as we may select for them; we may literally shut up the kingdom of heaven against men, and
suffer not themn that are entering to go in!
It is not too much, therefore to say that the Negroes
are in a state of almost absolute dependence upion their
owners for the words of eternal life.
They are the most needy of any people in our country.
This is very evident, from the exposition which we have
given of their dependence; as well as of their moral and
religious character. They have no education, no immediate access to the word of God, no competenit teachers
of their own color, no competent number of white
teachers, and are in a state of great ignorance and moral
degradation.
A!nd lastly, they are the most accessible. They speak
the satne langiuage with ourselves; dwell in the same
land, at our own doors; and are members of our house*OBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
holds. - No law forbi(ls the religious instruction of the
Negroes, orally, t, proper instructers, either during the
week or on the Sabbath day; and any minister of the
Gospel, or any owner, may undertake tile good work,
and prosecute it as largely and as long as he pleases.
We are prepared now to take up the obligation of the
church of Christ in the slave-holding States to inmpart
the Gospel of Salvation to the Negroes within those
States.
1. That obligation is imposed upon us ia the first
instance by the providence of God.
This follows undeniably from al,l our previous statements, in tl,e history of their religious instruction, and
in the sketclh of their mnoral and religious condition,
But it may be of some service to be particular under
this head. It was by the permission of Almighty God,
in his inscrutable providence over the affdirs, oS men,
that the Negroes were taken from Africa and transported
to these shores. Thle inhabitants of the Coloiies at
their first introduction had nothing to (lo with the infaS,
mous traffic, and were, we may say, universally opposed
to it.'I'he iniquity of the traffic and, of their first intro.
duction, rests upon the Mother Country.
Being brought here they were brought as slaves; in
the providence of God we were constituted masters.;
superiors; and constitut,ed their guardians. And all
the laws in relation to them, civilly, socially, and religiously considered, were framed by ourselves.  They
thus were placed under otr control, and not exclusively
for our benefit hut for theirs also..We could not overlook the fact that they were men;
holding the same relations to God as ourselves - whose
r~eligious, interests were certainly their highest and bes&amp;t
159160     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
and that ourfirst and fundamental duty was to provide
to the extent of our ability, for the pepepetal security of
those. interests. Our relations to them and their relations
to us,, continue the same to the present hour, and the
provi(lence of God still binds upon us the great duty of'
imparting to them the Gospel of eternal life.
2. The obligation is imposed upon us by the word of'
God.
As already evinced from general. principles and coml.
mands; the sum of all is, thlat the Gospel is the gift ofGod to men, and those who possess it are bound to,
bestow it upon those whbo do not.
A few passages of a genceral character may be ad,
vanced, bearing strongly on: the point in hand.
"Go ye into all the worldl and preach the Gospel. to
every creature." Our Lord in this command recognizes
men, not as of a particular nation or color, but collects
ivyely, as the intelligent an(d accountable creatures of
God. "God hath made of one blood all the nations of
men."   It is therefo)re necessary that the Gospel be
preaclicd to the Negroes as well as to the other varieties
of the race, and seeing that they have not put ia from,
them, nor judged themselves unworthy of everlasting
l'i:fe, we catnnot, we. dare not, neglect them and turn to
othlers.''.Thoui shalt love thy neighbor. as. thyself."  And
who are our neighbors if the Negroes are not? They
are members of the same great family of men; and
members of our own communities and parts of our very
households; and spend their days in our service. If we
see tlem stripped of necessary religious privileges, and
lying in their depravity, helpless, and exposed to eternal
4tebttb, sha!l we be neighbors untQo them if we loook uponOBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
them and see their misery and pass by without affording
them what relief may be in our power?
"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do
to you, do you even so to them."  Were we in the condition of the Negro and he in our own; able to read
and to appreciate the word of God, and to impart it to
us, would we not tliink it his duty to do it? Yes. And
if he neglected that duty we should consider him deficient both in humanity and religion.
But we advance a step further. The word of God
recognizes the relation of master and servant, and
addresses express commands to us as masters.
In the constitution of his visible church on earth
Almighty God included the servants offamilies; commanded the sign of his everlasting and gracious covenant to be made in their flesh, and thereby secured to
them, as well as to children the privileges and blessings
of the same. He would have them trained up in the
knowledge of his most holy name and for his service:
nor must they be neglected, nor excluded. Gen. 17:
12-13. "And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the:house or bought with money
of any stranger, which is not of thy seed,-;" and the
command is repeated, to show- his tender regard for the
poor, and that his: covenant embraces them. "He that
is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy
money must needs be circumcised; and my covenant
shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."  In
obedience to this command Akbraham "in the self-same
day circumcised his son Ishmael and all that were born
in his house, and all that were bought with his money."'
v. 2-3. He apprehended the will of God as expresse&amp;

in tile covenant, and received the divine approbation::
"for I klnow him that he will command hiis children and.
his household alter him, and they shall lieep the way of
t3le Lord to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may
bring upon Abraham that which hehath spoklen of him."
Gent. 18: 19.'l'he rest of the Sabbath was secuired to servants in,
the Decalogue: " in it thou shalt not (ldo any work, thou
nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant nor thy
mvaid-servant." -Exod. 0: 8 - 11. The sacred festivals were opened to them., and along withl their mlasters
they were to rejoice before the Lord: they were also to
present sacrifices aiid offerings to the Lord, in the
appoirlte(i place and eat of them  "before the Lord,"
vith their masters. "' Thou mayest not eat, within thy
gates, the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wi-ne, or of thy
oil, or the firstlings of thy herds, or of thy flocks, nor
any of thy vows which tliou v~owest, nor thy free will
offerings, or heave offering of thinre hand: but thou
mnust eat them before the Lord, inr the place vwhich the
Lortl thy Go:l shall choose, thou and thy son and thy
dlaughlter, and thy man-servant and thy mraid servant,"
-Dcut. 12: 17, 18.     "Arnl thou shalt keep the
feast of weeks: and thou shalt rejoice before the
Lord thy Gotl, thou, and thy son, ancl thy daughter, and
thy man-scrvant, andl thy maid-scrvant."   So also
" the feast of tabercnacles." - Deut. 16: 1 - 16.
Thus in the Old Testament, the law of God, and the
Sanctuary and all its privileges, were opened to servants
and secured to them by the declaired will of God: and.
it was the (luty of masters to comman(l their households
after them, that they should keep the way of the Lord
to do justice and ju(lgment: otherwise the Lord would
not bring upon them the promised blessings.OB-LIGATIONS OF TUE CHURCH.
Tile Ncw Testament is, if possible more explicit.
In several epistles, the relation of master and servant
is recognized, and the mutual duties of each arising out
of that relation mutually insisted upon. MIasters and
servants are addressed as belonging to the same churches
and heirs of the s!ame grace of life: 1 Timn. 6: 1-5.,
Eph. Col.
What Iind of servants are intentled?  Slaves: the
original teaches us so, while the very duties einjoined
upon servants and the obseivations made upon their condition, (I Cor. 7: 20-- 12,) confirms the fact that they
were literally Slaves. A nd the kind of slaverv that existed among the Jewvs was that allowe(l in the Old Testament; which may be considered identical with that
which prevails amongst us at the present time; and no
one will deny that theslavery which existed among the
Greeks and Roimarns and Gentile nations, was identical
with our own. All authentic history, anid the codification of the Roman laws made in the reign of Justinian,
prove it. The slaves were more heterogenous in their
national origin, than ours. Among them however existed Negroes: and in no small numbers. Indeed a traffic
in Negro slaves had l)been carried( on for centuries before
Isabella gave permission for their transportation to these
western shores; and they were sold and scattered over all
the east.
When th'erefore the New Testament addresses commands to Masters, we are the identicalpersons intended.
We are Masters in the New Testament sense. We are
addressed as directly anrid as identically, as when we are
Fathers, and it is said " Fathers p,ovoke not your children to wrath."
And what are these commanIds?'And ye Masters,
1,63h2 RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
1. Account of the Introduction of Negroes into the
the Colonies under the Government of Great Britain.
It was in the year 1501 that Isabella of Spain granted
permission for the introduction of Negro slaves into
Hispaniola; but such only as had been born in Spain,
or in slavery among Christians; and in the following
year a few had been sent into the New World.
In 1508 the Spaniards opened a direct trade in slaves,
and imported Negroes into Hispaniola from the Portugese settlements on the Coast of Guinea. Ferdinand
V., by royal ordinance, enjoined a direct traffic in slaves
between Guinea and Hispaniola, in 1511, and Charles
V., in 1512-13.
In 1517 Charles V. granted a patent to onie of his
Flemish favorites, containing an exclusive right of importing slaves, four thousand annually, into Hispaniola,
Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This favorite sold
his patent to some Genoese merchants for 25,000 ducats,
and they were the first who brought into regular form that
commerce for slaves between Africa andI America, which
has since been carried on under such revolting circumstances andcl to suchi an amazing extent.
Forty-five years after, in 1562-3, the English entered
the trade under Sir John Hawkins and carrie(l Negroes
from Africa to Hispaniola, and in 1567 Queen Elizabeth
protected andl shal ed the traffic. Thus the Mother Courntry was engage(I in the traffic forty-five years befoie the
first permanent settlement was made in her American
Colonies, which was at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.
The Dutch, in common wvith other maritime nations
of Europe, engage(d in the trade, and( a man-of-war of
that nation, from the Coast of' Guinea, in August, 1620,
(four months before the Plymouth- Colony arrived in

do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening:
knowing that your Master also is in Heaven: neither is
there respect of persons with him." Eph. 6: 9.
As servants are exhorted to fulfil their duties to their
masters, "as the servants of Christ, doing the will of
God from the heart:" having respect to their accountability to God; so also masteIs are exhorted to do the
same things, to fulfil their duties to their servants, from
the same principle of obedience to God and respect to
future accountability.
"Masters give unto your servants that which is just
and equal: knowing that ye also have a Master in IHeaven."  Col. 4: 1. Masters are here required to treat
their servants justly and equitably, in respect, of course,
to all their interests, both for time and eternity; for they
shall account to God for the same.
Thus doth God put his finger upon us as Masters. He
holds up before our faces our servants and our duties to
them. He commands us to fulfil those duties unlder the
pain of his displeasure. He tells us that in the performance of duty he does not respect us more than he res.
pects them.
Can any one doubt that among the duties of Masters,
is that of imparting, and causing to be imparted to them
the Gospel of Salvation? Supposing Masters gave unto
their servants that which was just and equal for this present life--and gave no more: would that come up to
the spirit and power of the command? Would it be just
and equal for masters to suffer them to remain in ignorance of the way of salvation, to die. and be eternally
lost?  Surely not. Says Job. "If I did despise the
cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, when
they contended with me:: what shall I do. when GodOBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
riseth up? And when he visiteth whIat shall I answer
bim? Did not he that made me in the womb, make him?
And did not one fashion us in the womb? " If we neglect to evangelize our servants, they may justly have a
controversy with us; and if we continue to (lespise their
cause, in the day when God riseth up for judgement,
we shall be speechless.
Thus by the providence and word of God are we under obligations to impart the Gospel to our servants.
It may be added, that we cannot disregard this obligation thus divinely imposed, without forfeitinng our
humanity, our gratitude, our consistency, and our claim
to the spirit of christianity itself.
Our Humanity.
Humanity is that kindness and good will towards our
fellow creatures which prompts us to sympathize with
them in their necessities and sufferings, and to exert ourselves for their relief.
The Lord Jesus has furnished us with the most beautiftul and striking illustrations of this virtue. "What
man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep,
and if it fall into a pit: will he not lay hold on it and
lift it out? "  "Doth not each one of you, loose his ox
or his ass from thle stall and lead him away to watering?
And ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham,
whom Satan hath bound, ]o these eighteen years, be
loosed firom  this bond?"  rlatt, 12: 10- 13. Luke
13: 14- 16, 14; 2- 6. Apply the reasoning: 4"How
much then is a man better than, a sheep or an ox?"
Wheni our servants are sick and diseased, we do not suffer them to want; we physic and nurse them. But are
not their souls, more precious thaq their bodies? Much
more then should we l~ft our servar4ts from the pit of igno165,166    RELIcIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
rance, moral pollution and death into which they have
fallen.  Much more should we strive to loose them
(bound for so many years!) from the bonds of sin and
satan and lead away their famishing souls to the water
of life.
Our Gratitude. They nurse us in infancy, contribute
to our pleasures and pastimes in youth; and furnish
us with the means of education. They constitute
our wealth, and yiel(l us all the comforts and conveniences of life; they may in a (legree adopt towards
us, the langilage of Jacob to Laban, "thus I was: in
the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night
and my sleep departed from mine eyes:" they watch
around our langiishing beds in sickness; share in our
rnisfortunes, weep over us when we die; prepare us for
the burial and carry us to the house appointed for all the
living.
r1he obligations, the sacrifice and service are not to be
all on one side, in the relation of master and servant. If
we have been ma(de partakers of their carnal things, our
duty is also to minister uinto them in spiritual things,
Rom. 15: 27. 1 Cor. 9: 11. And shall we consid(er
it " a great thing " to fuilfil this duty?  The kindest and
the most gratefiul return which we can make them, is to
put them in possession of the iichest gift of God to men,
the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Clhrist.
If we neglect to do this, we shall forfeit also our consistency.
Consistency is the correspondence of our conduct or
practice with our professed principles. Ezra 8: 22.

Christ's kingdom may come, and that his Gospel may
be preached to every people under heaven. We have
indeed assisted in sending missionaries to the heathen;
thousands of miles from us; and to multitudes of destitute white settlements in our own country; in founding
Theological Seminaries and filling them  with students,
that the (lemand for laborers in the great harvest might
be stupplied. We have assisted in lhaving the gospel
preached in our public prisons; in the harbors of our
sea-port cities, and along the lines of our canals and the
shores of our lakes and rivers, to those who do business
on the great waters. We have assisted in gathering the
children of parents of every condition into Sabbath
Schools; and in efforts to stay the swellings of the fiery
waves of intemperance. We have been printing Bibles
and tracts and religious works, with which to supply
every family and every individual in our land, and also
to meet the urgent demands for the same from other
lands. Trhis is all as it shoul(l be. But what have we
done publicly, systematically and perseveringly for the
Negroes, in order that they also might enjoy the gospel
of Christ?  Why are they as a class overlooked by us
in our benevolent regards and efforts? What blindness
hath happened to us in part, that we cannot see theit
spiritual necessities and feel the claims which they un.
deniably have upon us? Our Lord in view of our works,
will say to us, " these ought ye to have done and not to
leave the other undone."
We cannot cry out against the Papists for withholding
the Scriptures from the common people and keeping
them in ignorance of the way of life, for our incolsis-.

truths, which we certainly do while we will not provide
ways and means of having it read and explained to
them.
The celebrated John Randolph, on a visit to a female
friend, found her surrounded with her seamstresses,
making up a quantity of clothing. "Whllat work have
you in hand? "  "0 sir, I am preparing this clothing to
send to the poor Greeks."  On taking leave at the steps
of the mansion, he saw some of her servants in need of
the very clothing which their tender-hearted mistress
was sending abroad. He exclaimed, "Madam, madamr
the Greeks are at your door!"
If we neglect to impart the Gospel to the Negroes,
our inconsistency will be most glaring and shameful.
And fiurthermore, we shall forfeit our claim to the
spirit of Christianity itself.
The remarks under the head of consistency evidenced
this position, but nevertheless it will allow of a distinct
consideration.
This spirit is love. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, with all thy mind, and with all
thy strength; and thy neighbor as thyself."  Love is
of God. E"He that loveth is born of God, for God is
love."  "In this was manifested the love of God towv
ards us, because that God sent his only begotten Son
into the world, that we might live through him."-1
John 4: 7- 11. His love has respect to the immortal
souls of men; their everlasting salvation. For this our
Lord Jesus Christ came into the world and labored,
suffered and died on the cross. The same spirit is
wrought in the hearts of all who are truly his disciples.
Their chief joy is tihe glory of God in the salvation of
men; the increase of the church upon the earth. The169
OBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
cherished and ever-living desire of their soul is that men
may be converted to God. To effect this conversion
they willingly labor and submit to sacrifices, even, if
need be, unto death. This is the spirit which burns and
glows in all the word of God; unquenchable-invincible in its progress, because originated and sustained by
the grace and power of the Almighty.
"6 I am a (lebtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise. So, as nuch
as in me is, I am ready to preach the Gospel to you
that are at Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the
Gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto
salvation, to every one that believeth; to the Jewv first
and also to the Greek."  "I say the truth in Christ, I
lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the
Holy Ghost; that I have great heaviness and continual
sorrow of heart. For I could wish that myself were
accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh."--Rom. 1: 14- 16, and 9: 1 - 3. " For
the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge
that if one died for all, then were all dead: andl he died
for all that they which live, should not henceforth live
unto themselves, but unto him which (lied forr them, and
rose again."- 2 Cor. 5: 14 - 15. " I will very gladly
spend and be spent for you (for your souls,") -12: 15.
"Yea, an(d if I be offered (i. e. my strcngth and life
offered up,) upon the sacrifice and service of your faith,
I joy and rejoice with you all."- Phil. 2: 17.
Where then this spirit is wanting, there is wanting
the very spirit of Christianity itself.

cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men!"Mat. 5: 13-16.
The idea that we possess the spirit of Chiistianity in
its perfection, while we constantly and directly neglect
the evangelization of the Negroes, when it lies within our
power, is preposterous in the extreme. We are neither
"the light of the world:" nor "' the salt of the earth."
Reverse the order of Providence. Let us recur to
the illustration already adduced. Were we in the condition of the Negro, and he in our condition, able to
read an(d to appreciate the Gospel: experimentally acquainted with it: a partaker of its privileges and of its
eternal hopes; would we consider it his duty, (a duty
which lie was well able to perform,) to make us partakers with himself in the Gospel: that Gospel to which
we have a right as the gift of God to all men; and which
we could claim at his hands as the divinely appointed
almoner of God's mercy to us: that Gospel which is
every thing to perishing sinners and which alone could
yield us happiness in our humble lot? Certainly we
should. Suppose he would or he did not? Could we
believe that he sincerely felt all the amazing and soulstirring truths whiclh the Gospel contains?  Could we
believe that he possessed the spirit of the Gospel? No,
no! we could not!

Such are the considerations which we must address to
ourselves, who reside in the Southern States, in order
that we may be awakened to the great duty of imparting
the Gospel to the Negroes.
2. We now turn to the Negroes in the free States.
And our remaks on the duty of affording them the
Gospel, need not be protracted after what has been said.
It is the duty of the white churches in the free States
to afford the Gospel to the Negroes, for the following
plain reasons among others.
1. Because of their general poverty.
They are, as a class, a poor people; among, if not,
", the poor of the land."  And consequently are not able
to give suitable encouragement to the institutions of
religion; not able to build churches, support ministers,
or buy books and maintain Sabbath schools. The means
must come from purses other than their own. Such
has been the fact in the majority of instances where
the Gospel has received an adequate support among
them. More than the majority have little or nothing to
give; they barely make out to obtain the necessaries of
life.
171172.    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
2. Because of their moral degradation.
This has been in a measure demonstiated.  The
statements already made need not be repeated. They are
a proper field for missionary effort; and have been to a
great extent, vexy strangely overlooked. Such a mass
of ignorance and vice can in no way be desirable in any
communi.ty, whether we view them in a civil or religious
light. Their corrupting influence in cities, where they
chiefly congregate, has never beenl inquired into, nor duly
appreciated.
3. Because of their entire dependence upon the whites
for their every improvement.
They have almost no spirit of moral improvement
among themselves; it is not to be expected from them
considering their character and circumstances. They
have no men of influence, no leaders of their own color,
who are able to sway the people; to project and execute
plans for their general religious improvement.  Nor
have they societies of their own foi the purpose. The
truth is, they do not look to themselves; they do not
depend upon themselves. They look up to and depend
upon the whites. The feeling of subjection and dependence whicli they had in a state of slavery, is hereditary
and is kept alive by the frequent accession of Negroes,
escaped from servitude or set free. Then the vast superiority of the whites in point of numbers, intelligence,
morality, and station, cherish it. Hence the efforts of
the whites for their benefit are received with special
favor and relied upon. At least it was so in times past.
They have of late years been taught to distinguish
between friendly and hostile whites; and they have
been inflated with high notions of their perfect equality
with the whites in wisdom, standing, rights,. and imporOBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
tance. The effect has been, and it should not be deemed
extraordinary, that they have become rather heady and
high-minded; some of their friends have not been able
to do them the goo(l that they wished; and others
disguted, have ceased to feel and to act for them.
Whether they will be ultimately benefitted by this
increase of knowledge and sense of importance, remains
to be seen.
4. Because of consistency.
The efforts for the moral and religious improveme n
of the Negroes in the free States, do not correspond
with the profession of interest in them, as a class of
people.
With some, the bestowment of freedom is the sum of
all duty, And freedom is the grand catholicon for all
the evils which harrass and oppress the colored man.
It has not proved exactly so, in the free States. There
are (listricts in Rhode Island, in New Jersey, New York,
and Delaware, once peopled with Negroes. They were
emancipated on the soil, and now there is scarcely one
to be seen. They have been scattered and driven off,.
and have melted away before the whites. Their few
descendants are "making out to live" in cities, and in,
country situations, here and there. At the present day
the Negroes are not reached as a class by e(ducation and
religion.  They are not a (lesirable population-so
confessed on all hands; an(d their intelligence, morality
and thrift in the free States, give but poor encouragement to the doctrine of emancipation in those parts of
the Union where they are hel(l to service.
The overwhelming majority in. the free States are
whites. They possess all the intelligence, wealth, and
power; and move on without disturbance from the few

of their introduction into the Colonies.  From this
period they were gradually, and at different times, introduced into all the Colonies fronm Massachusetts to Georgia; and for the most part, contrary to the wishes of
the Colonists.
The first cargo of Negro slaves was brought into
Boston in 1645, and though their introduction was
denounced and the Negroes ordered to be "returned at
public charge;" yet it was afterwards permitted, and
people engaged in the tra(de.
In Maryland acts were passed encouraging the importation of Negroes, in 1671; and in this same year they
were first introduced into South Carolina. They were
legally admitted into Gcorgia in 1747. The precise
year of their admission into the remaining eight of the
old thirteen Colonies is not accurately known.
2. Estimated Negro Population of the Colonies at
the Declaration of Independeince; atd Census of 1790.
1 have no references at hand by which to determine
the number of Negroes in each of the Colonies, nor the
aggregate in all, before the Declaration of Independence,
as no general census was ever taken of the Colonies
while they continued such. But there are statements of
the number in most of the Colonies, given in different
years, which I shall proceed to mention.
Virginia was settled in 1607, atnd in 1671 contained
2,000 Negroes; in 1763, 100,000.
Massachusetts was settled in 1620, and in 1763 contained 4,500.
Rhode Island was settled in 1636.  In 1680 had
imported but a few Negroes, in 1730 contaited 1J648S

Negroes.among them. The weight of the Negroes uponthe wheels of society is scarcely felt. But what would
be the state of things if the whites were in the minority
and they the majority? I shall not undertake to furnish
an answer to the question which every man of ordinary
consideration can do for himself the moment after it is
put to him. The great duty of the churches and friends
of the Negroes in the free States, is to attempt, more
systematically and efficiently, their moral and religious
improvement.OBLIGATIONS OF~ THE CHURCH.
CHAPTER IL,
EXCUSES.
I shall proceed immediately to the excuses in relation
to a discharge of the obligations now proved to rest
upon the church of Christ in the United States, to
attempt the improvement of the moral and religious
condition of the Negroes, usually advanced in the slaveholding States. In giving them a candid consideration
those made in the free States may in a measure be anticipated.
The Negroes have the Gospel already,
They have access to the churches on the Sabbath,
and hear the same preaching that their masters do; they
are favored frequently witi services from the ministers,
expressly for their instruction; they are received into,
and are under the watch and discipline of the white
churches; there are some Sabbath schools for them
they have plantation prayers, and numerous preachers
and exhorters of their own color, and some of them
are able to read; nor do they know any other religion
but the Christian religion.
It is true they have access to the house of God on the
Sabbath; but it is also true that evenr where the privi175176     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIlE NEGROES.
lege is within their reach, a minority only, (and frequently
a very small one) embrace it. There are multitudes of
districts in the South and Southwest, in which the
churches cannot contain one-tenth of the Negro population; besides others in which there are no churches at
all. It must be remembered also that in many of those
churches there is preaching only once a fortnight, or
once a month, and then perhaps only one sermon. To
say that they fare:as well as their masters does not settle
the point; for great numbers of masters have very few
or no religious privileges at all.
The direct preaching of ministers to the Negroes is
well, and is a great benefit. But the number who do this
is far smaller than it should be. The ordinary preaching
to the whites makes little impression upon the blacks,
being above their comprehension and not ma(le applicable to them. Hence their stupid looks, their indifferent
staring, their profound sleeps, and their thin attendance.
What is there to light up the countenance with intelligence; to rivet attention; to banish drowsiness, so
common to laboring men and men unaccustomed to thi}nk
when sitting still; what is there to attract them to the
house of God?  Nothinig but sound and showv. Solid
instruction, pungent appeals to the conscience, will bring
men to the house of God and retain them in attend(ance
there, and nothing else will. But divine truth is not
thus adapted to the Negroes, by ministers, in their sermons to the whites; an(d those Negroes who enjoy such
a dispensation of tile Gospel as this, ulpon carefuil examination, are foundl to be sadly deficient in a knowledge
of religion, an(d we are surprised to find Christianity in
absolute conjunction with a people and yet conlferling
upon them so few benefits.OBLIGATIONS OF THE CIHURCtI.
The general preaching to the whites will not answer
the purpose. T['he Negroes require preaching specially
adapte(d to them. It is true they are received into, and
are under the watch and care of, white churches; but
that fact does not prove that they are properly enlightened, and are continue(d under courses of instruction, so
that- they go on unto perfection.  In lhundreds of
instances the very reverse is the fact; their ignorance,
superstition, and deception are complained of. Their
piety is taken upon trust; and the numerous and perplexing cases of discipline for gross iminoralities sufficiently prove that the complaints uttered against them
are well founded. A man must not stand on the outside
of a church and ju(lge of the church character and
standing of these people, he must go within.
The Sabbath schools for their exclusive benefit, taking
the entire population, need scarcely be named. Their
plantation meetings serve to keep alive religion among
thenm, but contribute little to the increase of their intelligence; while there are hundreds of plantations where
there are no such meetings at all, there being few or no
church members to conduct them.
We have colored ministers and exhorters, but their
numbers are wholly inadequate to the supply of the
Negroes; and while their ministrations are infrequent
and conducted in great weakness, there are some of
them whose moral character is justly suspected and who
may be considered blind lea(lers of the blind.
It is true there are no forms of idolatry prevalent
among them, nor have the corruptions of Christihanity
made progress among them, the field being too low and
poor to enlist the sympathies of the leadeirs and advocates of such corruption, except the Papists, who ia
177178    IRELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
some of our chief towns have proselyted some of them;
yet Christianity, as understood an(l professed by them, is,
as I have already attempted to show, exceedingly imperfect, tind needing great improvement.
The Negroes are incapable of receiving religiousinstruction, except to a very limited extent.
From the manner in which their religious instruction
is neglected, it would appear that their incapacity is
taken for granted. Appealing to our own experience
in their instruction, we should judge the objection to be
a mistake. They are capable, even under oral instruction, and that not enjoyed in any high degree of perfection, of making very considerable advances in religious
knowledge.
But if they are capable of receiving instruction sufficient to make plain to them the way of salvation, then
their capacities should be filled to overflowing, to that
extent. In all reason and conscience deny it not to
them, for it is their everlasting life. The mind of man
is created so as to admit of eternal expansion and progression in knowledge and holiness. The good work
which is done for them in time will be carried forward
unto perfection in eternity.
But to pursue the excuse a step further. It is customary with many to entertain low opinions of the
intellectual capacity of the Negroes.  Whether this be
right or wrong we leave every man to judge for himself
after a due investigation of the subject; and to judge,
likewise, whether their mental weakness is to be attributed to the circumstances of their condition, or to any
difference as made by the Author of their existence
between them and other men. If God has made such
a difference, it cannot be proved to be any impeachmentOBLIGATIONS OF THE CHU3RCH.
either of Ihis wisdom, goodness, or justice. Such a
difference exists between i72dividuals without any such
impeachment, and may exist in like man-ner between the
r-aces of manlkind. But to suppose the Negroes too
stupid to comprehend the essential doctrines of Christianity is certainly to disregard the testimony of God's
word, the witness of his Spirit, the evidence of facts.
What saith the Scripture? "lHe hath made of one
blood all nations of men that dwell on all tle face of the
earth;" and again, "God is no respecter of persons;
but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh
righteousness is accepted with him."--Acts 10: 34, 35.
What then can be plainer than that all men have one
common origin, and that all are capable of exercising
proper affections towards God; and this necessarily implies a capability of understanding the divine law. If it
be allowed that the Negroes are men, then these things
are true in regard to them, and thus by the word of God
does it appear that they are capable of understanding the
Gospel. And does not the Spirit of God bear witness to
their capacity?  Are there not great numbers who have
been enlightened, regenerated, and sanctified by him?
Their ignorance of divine subjects is owing to their want
of proper instruction, and not at all to any defect of
mental constitution.
Thle Gospel meets with little success among them.
Grant the fact to be so:; from the view which has been
taken of the limited instruction of the Negroes and their
extremely ignorant and vicious condition, and the feeble
encouragement which many receive in their efforts to
lead a religious life, our wonder more naturally might be,
not that the Gospel meets with little success among them
but that it meets with any success at all.
179180  RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
The excuse indicates a want of patience and proper
feeling and consideration. If the Negroes in a state of
ignorance and vice are not made intelligent and pious in
a few days, we are ready to cry out that labor is vain;
the field must be abandoned as an unprofitable one. We
act unreasonably an(d uncharitably. We expect more of
them than of ourselves or any other people.  They who
would evangelize servants must "let Patience have her
perfect work."
It certainly comes with a very ill grace from us to speak
of the little success of the Gospel amongst the Negroes.
That little success is our condemnation; for what great
efforts have we inade that we should expect great success.
Where we bestow little labor, we must expect but little
reward.
But I apprehend that in the judgment of charity, considering the circumnstances of the Negroes, the Gospel,
when adequately preached to them, meets with as good
success as among any other people to whom it may
come. Why sliould it not? Can it be shown that they
are given over to judicial blindness of mind and hardness of heart?  Can it be shown that a work of grace
in them is more difficult to the Omnipotent Spirit, than
in another people?
If the Gospel lhas met with any success at all, it
should operate as an encouragement to us, to make
more vigorous efforts. Putting that success at the lowest
point the salvation of but one soul, it is certainly great.
For were it inow revealed to us that the most extensive
system of instruction which we could devise, requiring
a vast amounlt of labor and protracted through ages,

There is much truth, and painfill truth, in the excuse.
Our destitutions are very great!'" The harvest truly is
plenteous, but the laborers are few;" and few, inldeed,

Bu.t thle excuse cannot be admitted as valid, where suitable eforts have not been nmade to procure a tninister,
and suitable compensation offered for his services, when
such compenisation can he afforded by those who call for

New Hampshire was settled from Massachusetts and
became a separate Colony in 1741, and in 1775 contained
659 Negroes.
New York was settled by the Dutch in 1613. In
1756 contained 13,542.
New Jersey was settled 1627.  In 1738 contained
3,981 Negroes and slaves, and in 1745, 4,606.
IMaryland was granted to Lord Baltimore in 1632.
In 1755 contained 42,764 Negroes, and for a time, 2,000
were imported annually. Mr. Burke says, in 1757 the
number was upwards of 60,000..
North Carolina was permanently settled in 1650,
and became distinct from Virginia in 1727. In 1701 it
had 5000 inhabitants, besides Negroes and Indians, and
in 1702, 6,000.
South Carolina was granlted to Lord Clarendon ir

were imported. In 1765 contained 90,000; in 1773 over
6,000 were imported. This Colony lost 25,000 Negroes
in the Revolutionary war.
Georgia was settled in 1732-3. Slavery waslegalize(.
in 1747, and in 1772 contained 14,000 Negroes.
The probable number of Negroes in the Colonies at
the Declaration of Independence in 1776, may be ascertained in the following manner. Take the known population in the different Colonies nearest the year 1776;
compare that with the census of 1790; take into consideration the rate of increase from nature and from
importation, and also the decrease; and then give the
supposed population in round numbers.

" where there is a will tllere is a way."
Onice mnore: the minister says, my church allows me no
time to preach to the Negroes. I am wvilling to do so, if
I could.
In the first place, have you requested time to (lo so,

a church in the South which would not, upon a proper
consideration of the duty, yield to the wishes of its
minister in this respect.
And again: when you accepted the call to the pastoral
office, why did yotu tiot give the church to uiiderstand,
distitnctly, that you would dlevote a just proportion of
your labors to the servants attach-ied to the families of the
congregation; that you would consider yourself the
pastor of the servants as well as of the masters, parents
and children?OB.IAGATIONS 01 TIE CHURCH.   1
Such an interest in the religious instruction of servants would be hailed with joy by many churches, and
while it wouldl endear their ministers to them, it would
give them inlcreased confidenlce in their piety and a
stronger hope of being benefite(l by their labors.
Should it so happen that you are forbidden to preach
to thie Negroes by the people over whom you are set;led,
from no fault of your ow,t, bult from sheer opposition to
th!e vwork of religioius instrtuction, your course un(lotubtedly will be to reason thle case, calmly, conlsciertiously,
and (lecidedly, anld wait patiently fr a tiriie, and whlen
hope of change expires, withdraw to another fielsd. The
colllmissiosn is, " go ye into all tthe world and preach the
Gospel to everv creature:" and ino miniister ouight to be
influelced, either by the fear or favor of nmen, to go
cotntrary to that hligh commnniand. It is set down among
the aggravated ofteuces of the Jews, anii as filling up the
measuire of their sins, wvhen wrathll would corrie upon
them to the uttermost, thlat they forbid the Apostles' to
spceak to the Gentiles that they might be saved." --'lThes. 2: 14-16.  But whiile these remarks are made,
it becomes me to say as a matter of faict and of justice
to the Southern churches, that I have never known nor
heard of any such instance.  Efforts for the religious
instruction of the Negroes have been in some churches
suspended for a season, on account of the excited state
of public feeling, to be rcsumed when that excitement
should pass away.
M'e have occupied sufficient space on these excus:s.
Excuses we have none. Do not let its make them; but
faithfully inquire if the.reason of our neglect of duty,
does not arise from ignorance on the one hand, or indisposition on the other?

servant, care not for it, but if thou mayest be made free,
use it rather; for he that is called in the Lord being a
servant is the Lord's freeman," etc. May we not follow
in the footsteps of our Saviour and his Apostles, and
that with perfect safety too? Yea, and without proceeding as far as did the Apostle Paul? We maintain
that in judicious religious instruction there will be no
necessary interference with their civil condition. The
religious teacher must step out of his way for the
purpose.
The objection, it will be perceived, is levelled against
the influence of the Gospel itself; and if the Gospel
will subvert the institutions of our society then we should
fear to be instructed in it ourselves, and banish it altogether. And who would entertain such a monstrous
proposition?
But the Gospel is to be preached " to every creature;'
the knowledge of the Lord is to fill the earth; Almighty
God has so promised, and he will make it good. We
cannot, therefore, resist the progress of the Gospel.
We can exclude its light no more than we can that of
the sun. It is destined to, and will ultimately, reach
every Negro in our land. And what influences its spirit
and principles are in the providence of God to produce
upon their condition shall be produced; but the precise
nature and extent of those influences it is impossible to
determine. We may reason from one principle to another, and draw out conclusion after conclusion, into
one grand result, and the concatenation of the whole,
in our view, be perfect; and yet the sovreignty of God
like a disturbing force may enter in and preserve the
present constitution of our society substantially the same.
The subject is one of those "secret things" whichOBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
belong to God alone. His providential dealings towards
the nations of the earth are a great deep. They constitute the wonders of History. It is enough for every
reasonable and every Christian man to know that the
Gospel, like the sun, sheds down its influences upon
mankind decidedly yet calmly, and that it caulses all its
fruits to spring forth and to mature in their season without noise, or violence, or injustice, if men will but allow
to it its perfect way; and that those influences will fill
u'p the measure of the angelic song: " Glory to God in
the highest and oneearth peace, good will towards men."
-Luke 2: 14.
If we are in a strait, in view of the objection, let us
make the pious choice of David, "let us fall into the
hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great; " let us do
what he so clearly defines to be present duty, then shall
we cast ourselves and our servants into his hands, and
confidently rely upon hirn to reveal to us what may be
our future duty, and to guide us and our servants quietly
and intelligently in the way that we should go. The
path of present duty, on this as well as on all other
subjects, is the path of safety.
The second objection is -If we suffer our Negroes
to be religiously instructed, the way will be opened for
men from abroad to enter in and inculcate doctrines
subversive of our interests and safety.
In this objection the Gospel is not feared, but the
agents by whom it is preached. Our views in reply,
shall be briefly and we hope satisfactorily given.
There are men, who, if the door of access to the
Negroes in the South were thrown open indiscriminately
to all, would enter in to send among us not "peace,"
but literally "a sword."  MIen who fall under the Apos195196     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
tle's description in I Tim. 6: 1-5, an(l from whom, in
obedience to his comnian(l we would " withdraw ourselves."  Against the introduction of "'such" there
cannot be too much vigilance observed,
The field of lahbor among the Negroes in the South,
js one, in many respects, of no ordinary difliculty; and
it is the dictate as well of benevolence as of prudeoc.e
to inquire irnto the character an(I qualifications of those
who enter it. They should be Southern men; men
entitled to. that apellation; either those who lhave been
born and reared in the South, or those who have i(lentified themselves with the South, and are familiarly
acquainted with the structure of society; in a word, men
having their interests in the South. Such men woul(d
possess the confidence of tlhe community; for they
would not act in their official connection witlh the Negroes, in such a manner as to breed (listurbances, which
would inevitably jeopard their own lives and tend to the
utter prostration of thcir families and interests. They
would also, firom their experience and observation and
knowledge, be competent and:rofitable instructers of
the Negroes.
But the very spirit which prompts the objection refultes
it. For how is it possible wheii such a wary vigilance
is manifested, for ministers or religious teachers, entire
strangers in community, to come in, have access to the
Negroes privately and publicly, and sow the seeds of
discontent and revolt? It is impossible. They cannot
come unless we permit them.
Indeed, the most effectual method to preclude the
introduction of improper teachers, is for us to take the
religious instruction of ou7r Negroes into our own
hands, and to. superintend it ourselves. We shall thenOBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
know who their teachers are, and what and when and
where they are taught.
A third objection is - The religious instruction of
the Negroes will lead to neglect of duty and insubordination.
I ask how can it? You reply: why the very attention
you bestow upon them; the very instructions you give
them elevates them in their own consideration, prompts
them to assume an equality with their masters and
teaches them, practically at least, to neglect their woik
and to resist discipline. You teach them that " God is
no respecter of persons;" that " he hath made of one
blood all the nations of men;" "thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself; " "all things whatsoever ye would
that men should do to you, do ye even so to them;"
what use, let me ask, would they make of these sentences from the Gospel?
Let it be replied that the effect urged in thie objection
might result from imperfect and injudicious religious
instruction; indeed religious instruction may be communicated with the express design on the part of the
instructer to produce the effect referred to, instances of
which have occurred. But who will say that neglect of
duty and insubordination are the legitimate effects of the
Gospel purely and sincerely imparted to servants? Has
it not in all ages been viewed as the greatest civilizer of
the human race? As the most powerful of all causes
in allaying the wild and stormy and rebellious tempers
of the mind, and reducing men to habits of cheerful
industry, domestic virtue, submission to authority and
law, and peaceful intercourse in society?  He is but
poorly read in the history of his race who knows not
and who believes not this fact. I grant, and I do rejoice

in it, that religion is a great enlightener of the human
mind, that it does tend to give an elevation to character,
and dignity and importance to men; and to afford a
knowledge of, as well as a protection to, their interests
and rights'in their connection one with another. But
religion, at the same time, teaches all men submission
to the will of God expressed both in his Word and in
his Providence; and by its life giving spirit, influences
them to fulfil the duties of their respective callings faithfully and quietly. It is by our Lord compared to salt;
it preserves as wvell as purifies.
The Gospel recognizes the condition in which the
Negroes are, and inculcates the duties appropriate to it.
Ministers are commanded by the Apostle Paul to " exhort
servants to be obedient to their own masters and to please
them well in all things; not answering again, not purloining; but showing all good fidelity, that they may
adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things;
for the grace of God, tlhat bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men; teaching lus that denying ungodliness
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly righteously
and godly in this present world." - Titus 2: 9-12.
Again: "Let as many servants as are under the yoke
count their masters worthy of all honor, that the name
of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. And they
that have believing masters let them not despise them,
because they are brethren; but rather do them service,
because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the
benefit. These things teach and exhort." And the
Apostle is very positive with ministers that they impress
these duties upon servants, for in the next verse he adds,
-"If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to
wholesome words, even the words of our Lord JesusOBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about
questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy,
strife railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of
men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness; from such withdraw thyself."
1 Tim. 6; 1-5.
Writing to the church at Ephesus, he saith, "servants
be obedient to them that are your masters according to
the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your
heart, as unto Christ. Not with eye service as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of
God from the heart, with good will doing service, as to
the Lord and not to men; knowing that whatsoever good
thing any man doetli, the same shall he receive of the
Lord whether he be bond or free."-- Eph. 6: 5-8.
A similar passage occurs in his Epistle to the church at
Collosse. "Servants obey in all things your masters
according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as menpleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God; and
whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not
unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive
the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord
Christ. But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the
wrong which he hath done, and there is no respect of
persons."-- Col. 3: 22- 25.
The Apostle Peter is equally decided. "Servants be
subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the
good and gentle, but also to the froward. For this is
thankworthy, if a man for conscience towards God
endure grief, suffering wrongfully, For what glory is
it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take
it patiently? But if when ye do well and suffer for it,
199200     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THIE NEGROES.
ye take it patiently, tljis is acceptable with God. For
even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow
his steps."-- 1 Pet. 2: 18 - 25.
Such are the commands of the Gospel to servants, as
comprehensive of their duties as any master could desire;
and all excuses for unfaithfulness and insubordination
carefully guarded against, Yea, we hear the Apostle
Paul exclaim, "let every man abide in the same calling
wherein he was called. Art thou called being a servant?
Care not for it; but if thou mayest be free choose it
rather. For he that is called in the Lord being a servant, is the Lord's freeman; likewise also, he that is
called being free is Christ's servant. Ye are bought
with a price, be not ye the servants of men. Brethren
let every man wherein he is called, therein abide with
God." -1 Cor. 7: 20-24. And what do we see the
same Apostle do?   Ile restores the "unprofitable"
Onesimus to Philemon his master, though he had escaped
from him to a great distance. Thus putting into practice his own views and precepts. Ile calls the converted
slave " a brother beloved," now to be specially regarded
by Philemon, not only as a servant "in the flesh," but
as a Christian servant " in the Lord."  The Apostle
Paul holds the most perfect fellowship with his master,
as a truly christian man; in whose household there was
a company of believers--"a church"- for whom he
prayed "always;" in whose "faith and love toward
the Lord Jesus and toward all saints " he had " great
joy and consolation." He calls him " brother" - " our
dearly beloved and fellow-laborer." He felt no scruples
in receiving and laboring with him in the Gospel. His
letter to Philemon for its Christian courtesy, delicacy,
and tenderness, is above all praise.201
OBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
We now ask, will the duties of servants to their masters be neglected, and their authority dlespised, ty
instructions of this sort, an(d by a careful adherence to
the example of the Apostle Paul on the part of the
ministers of the Gospel? No never. Is not the discharge
of duty made more sure anti faithful, and respect for
authority strengthened by considerations drawn from the
omniscience of God and the retributions of eternity?
The fact is not to be questioned. Joseph exclaimed,
how can I do this great wicke(dness an(ti sin against
God?"  And what was the reply of the Christian Negro
when the ground of his obedience anti fidelity to his
master was inquired into?  "Sir, I fcar God, whose
eyes are in every place behold(ing the evil an(l the good;
therefore do I obey and am faithful as well beliind my
master's back as before his face."
What parent considers the religious instruction of his
children, as having  a ten(lency to make them  more
wiclicd and rebellious?  Should neglect of duty and
insubordination ensue upon the religious instruction of
servants, the fault will b.e discovered in imperfect instruction, or in the mismanagement of the master.
A fourth objection.   The Negroes wvill embrace
seasons of religious worship, for originating and
executing plan:s of insubordination and villany.
Th.s might be the case if they were allowed to congregate on plantations at nitrht, and at places of wvorship
on the Sabbath without a proper regulation of their
assemblies, or any supervision of a responsible white
teacher, or of planters themselves, Andfor the reason
that masses of men, especially of ignorant anti vicious
men, coming together under little or no restraint, naturally, yea, inevitably, fall into excesses and riots. But202    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
a proper regulation of the times and places of meeting,
and the faithful supervision of religious teachers, assisted
by deacons and elders, or planters, would preclude all
serious disorders. An experience of some eight years,
confirms me in the opinion. For in five or six hundred
meetings upon plantations during the week, and at
stations for preaching on the Sabbath, with congregations
varying from twenty to five hundred and more, I have
never been disturbed during a single meeting with any
noise or riot, and not more than three times have I had
occasion, after services, to interfere in checking disorderly conduct; and in the instances referred to, they
were private quarrels, the parties meeting and in a
moment of passion, assaulting each other. As it so
happened, in each instance, I was alone amidst hundreds
of them, and a single command quelled the disturbance
instantly. Wherever religious meetings have been embraced for purposes specified in the objection, on inquiry
it will be found that the people were left to themselves
and so fell into temptation.
But why are men so tenacious of religious meetings
and of religious teachers, as though the Negroes had
no other kind of meetings and no other kind of teachers?
Are they not privileged to assemble for feasting and
merriment? Do they not have their balls and parties of
pleasure, in town and country? Are they not collected
for miles around to huskings and other kinds of joblabor, where they diink and sing and revel like bacchanals?  What troops of them walk our streets in idle
search for labor? or sit in market plaecs all day long?
Are there not portions of all our chief towns inhabited

various characters and designs may find an introduction?
3Do they not rendezvous at low tippling shops, on terms
of companionship with their vicious keepers; some of
which are complete Negro exchanges, where all that
transpires in the social, the religious, the civil, and the
political world, is regularly made known and sagely
discussed?  "Judge not according to the appearance
but judge righteous judgement."-- John 7: 24.
A fifth objectionis religious instruction will do no
good; it will only make the Negroes worse men and
worse hypocrites?
It will be unnecessary to dwell upon this objection,
since it has beerf answered by much that has already
been advanced; and because those who urge it, do not
(as charity bids us conclude,) really believe in its truth;
unless indeed, they be avowed and malicious infidels;
and we have reason to be thankful there are very few
such amongst us.
Who are we? In what age and in what country of
the world do we live that we should question the excellency of the Gospel, the propriety of preaching it " to the
poor;"  What is the Gospel? Is it not, "6 the grace of
God that bringeth salvation; teaching us that denying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously and godly in this present woild; looking
for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave
himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity
and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of
good works?"-- Titus 2: 11-14. This is the Gospel.
These are the things which we are to teach and exhort.
And is it under such teaching and exhortation that men
will increase in crime and hypocrisy?  Why should the

1673. Mr. Baxter published his'" Christian Directory," in which he has a chapter of "Directions to those
ilasters in Foreign Plantations whlio have Negroes and.

them."'
The first Direction calls upon masters to "understand well howv far your power over your slaves extendeth
and what limits God hath set thereto."
" Remember that they have immortal souls, anid are
equally capable of salvation with yourselves: and therefore you have no power to do any thing which shall
hinder their salvation. Renmember that God is their
absolute o-wner, and that you have none but a derived
and limited propriety in them;-- that they and you are
equally under the government and laws of God;- -that
God is thei-r reconciled tender Father, and if they be
as good, doth love thdm as well as you;-- anid that they
are the redeemed ones of Christ: --Therefore, so use
them as to preserve Christ's right andinterest in them.'"204     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
Gospel produce an effect on Negroes, contrary to that
which it is designed to produce, and which it actually produces on all other meen, and on some whose condition is

Is any thiing too hard for Him, in thle regeneratiofi and

The objection is not supported by a solitary fact,

intelligence, mnorality and order, ihey are in advance of

lion after being admitted. A reformation on our part
in regard to these paiticulars, would produce a happy
effect upon the purity and permanency of their religious
character.  Nominal Christianity abounds most in
churches where the instruction and discipline are most
imperfect and weak, and from which the influence of
competent white instructers is most withdrawn.
But one or two irregularities in their meetings, one or
two defections from profession, are sufficient to prejudice the minds of many against the religious instruction
of the Negroes, Because they remain impenitent and
pervert the Gospel and deceive their fellow men, therefore are they unworthy of it?  Who then would be
worthy, if God should deal with men according to this
rule? Where is there a church on earth in which all the
members are pure?  What did the Apostle say of some
of the members of. the churches at Corinth and at
Philippi; and of the churches in Galatia? Did not our
Lord himself say that when the householder sowed wheat
his enemy sowed tares; that the net cast into the sea
gathered of every kind, both bad and good?
Admit the objection to be true, in its fullest extent,
and what then? Does it annul our duty? Far from it.
Let them harden themselves and grow worse under the
means of grace; whether they will hear or forbear, we
are to do our duty; we are to obey God; we are to
throw the responsibility of their salvation upon their
own shoulders, and clear our garments of their blood.
The objections now considered, we do not deem of
sufficient weight to alter the conclusion to which we
have already come, that it is our duty to impart sound
religious instruction to our colored population in the
slave States.

CHAPTER IV.
BENEFITS.
LE.T US proceed to the more agreeable employmnent
of showing the Benefits, which would flow from the
religious instruction of the Negroes,
There would be a better understanding of the relation
3of master and servant: and of their reciprocal duties.
Not much has been published in our country on the
relation and duties of master and servant.  And it
seems strange that it should be so, and since that relation
has existed so long and become so extensive; since so
much involving private and public happiness, depends
upon the faithful discharge of the duties of it. Not
much inquiry and discussion, in the way of conversation
has been indulged in, on the general subject; and not
much preaching upon it from the pulpit.
There are many of our owners who have never given
themselves the trouble, with the Scriptures in their
hands for a guide, solemnly and prayerfully to inquire
into the number and nature of those duties which they
owe to their servants and are in reason and in conscience
bound to perform. Nor do we think that there are many
servants who have been instructed and understand theisOBLIGATIONS OF TIHE CHURCH.
duties towards their masters and from what motives they
should discharge them.  What is the consequence?
Why, ignorance and indifference exist both on the one
part and on the other. Too much is left to custom, to
chance, to interest and convenience, to impulses. The
principle which regulates the relation and its duties, I
have heard defined thus: on the part of the master,
"get all, and give back as little as you can;" and on
the part of the servant, " give as little, and get back all
you can."  And what is the principle thus defined?
Pure selfishness! Considering what human nature is:
and observing the conduct of masters and servants, we
have ground to fear that there is too much truth in the
existence and influence of tlhiis principle. But we constantly see the severity of- it mitigated, even by itself,
lest it should over-shoot its own ends, and especially by
feelings of attachment and benevolence that spring up
between superiors. and inferiors.
There is something, however, above all this, that is
needed, and that something is the introduction of religion. Religion will tell the master that he is a master
"according to the flesh,"' only; that his servants are
fellow-creatures, and he has a master in heaven to whom
he shall finally account for his treatment of tliem.
Religion will tell the servant " to be obedient to masters
according to. the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart as unto Christ; knowing that whatsoever
good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of
the Lord whether he be bond or free." The master will
be led to inquiries of this sort. In what kind of houses.
do I permit them to live; what clothes do I give them?

In what temper and manner, and in what proportion to

their crimes do I allow them to be punished? What
care do I take of their family relations?  What am I
doing for their souls' salvation? In fine, what does God
require me to do to, and for them and their children, in
view of their happiness here and hereafter? Light will
insensibly break into his mind. Conscience will be
quickened, and before he is aware perhaps, his servants
will be greatly elevated in his regards, and lhe will feel
himself bound and willing to do more and more for
tlhem. The government of his plantation will not be, so
purely selfish as formerly. His interest will not be the
sole object of pursuit, nor offences against that visited
with sorer punishment than offences against God himself.
He will have an eye to the comfort, the interest of his
people, and endeavor to identify their interest with his,
and also to make them see and feel it to be so. It will
be a delight to him to see them enjoy the blessings of
the providence and the grace of God.
Such an attempt at a discharge of duty on religious
groundsi will produce favorable influences, upon the
feelings and conduct of servants. Religion will cause
them to understand their duties better, and to perform
them more perfectly and cheerfully.
The pecuniary interests of masters will be a vanced
as a necessary, consequence.
I do not mean that the introduction of the Gospel upon
a plantation in and of itself puts new life and vigor into
the laborersand the soil which they cultivate, and necessarily makes them more profitable to owners, than
plantations where the Gospel is not introduced at all.
By no means. Such a statement would be unfounded
in fact. For there are owners who take no pains whatever to have their Negroes instructed; but who feed andOBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
clothe and lodge them well, and are humane and take
the best care of tlhem, and by careful, slsilful and pushing management, go far bevontl their religious neiglhbors in their incomes.  But I mean, that religious
instruction is no detriment, but rather a benefit: that,
other things being equal, the plantation which enjoys
religious instruction wiil (lo better for the interests of
its owner, than it did before it enrjoyed suich instruction~.
Virtue is more profitable than vice; wliile this is allowed
to be no discovery, no man will question its tru'h.
Increased attention to the temporal comfort of servants
would improve their health; andl the expense of lost
labor by sickness, and of physicians' bills would be saved.
Their wants being more liberally supplied and sharing
more largely in the fruit of their labors, many temptations to theft, to which they are exposed, would be
removed; and they wouldl become more industrious
and(saving. Crime wvould be dimiinished.. Foi teachers

more, to pay greater regard to mutual cliaracter and
rights; the strong wouldl not so much oppress the weak;
family relations would be less liable to rupture; in

cultivated. Their work wouldl be more fa ithfully done;
their obedience more universal and more cheerfilly rendered. The genuine effects of religion upon them would
be,  v with good will doing service, as to the Lord and
not unto men."

And who can tell the pleasurable feelings of a humane
and' Christian master, in view of a moral eformation of
his servants?  He will thank God. that he is, if not
wholly, yet measurably relieved from Ierpetual watching,
from fiault-finding and tllreateining and heart-sickening
severity; and that he can begin at.least to govern somewhat by the law of love. The good character of his
people render them more valuable as property; and
even should lie not make as much as forrnerly, the loss
is more than balanced by what h:e sees his people enjoy

"The thing that hatl been it is that which may be;"

Besides the general and special influences of the Gospel
now adverted to, safety will be connected with the very
dispensation of it, in two particulars, which 1 would not
omit to mention.'T'he first is:- The very effort of
masters to instruct their people, creates a strong bond of
union and draws out their kindly feelings to their masters:
kindness produces kindness: love begets its own likeness.
The presence also of white instructers, settled ministers
or missionaries, in their private as;well as public religious
assemblies and firee intercourse with the people and with
their influential men and leaders, exert a restraining
influence upoIl any spirit of insubordination that may
exist, and at the same time give opportunities for its
detection. The Negroes are as capable of strong personal attaclhments to their religious instructers as are ally
other people; and of their owin vwill are inclined to make
confidential communications.
The seconld particular is, that the Gospel being dis.
pensed in its purity, the Negroes will be disabused of
their ignorance and superstition, and thus be placed
beyond the reach of designing men. The direct way of
exposing them  to acts of insubordination is to leave
them in ignorance and superstition, to the care of their
owii religion. Then may the blind lead the blind, and
both shall fall into tlhe ditch: then may they be made the
easy and willing instruments of avarice, of lust, of power
or of revenge.  Ignorance - religious ignorance - so
far firom being any safety, is the very marrow of oulr sin
against this people, and the very rock of our danger.
Religion and religious teachers they must and will hIave,
and if they are not fiurniished with the true they will embrace the false. And what, I would add, is the language

In the conspiracy in the city of New York in 1712,
Mr. Neau's school for the religious instruction of the
Negroes was blamed as the main occasion of the barbarous plot. And yet, " upon full trial the guilty Negroes
were found to be such as never came to Mr. Neau's school,
and what is very observable, the persons whose Negroes
were found most guilty, were such as were the declared
opposers oJ making them Christians! "
The rebellions in 1730 and the three in 1739, in South
Carolina, were fomented by the Spaniards in St. Augustine, and religion had' nothing to do with them. The
ground of that in 1741 in New York city again, I do
not precisely understand; but it;is pretty well ascertained
that it was not religion. It is questioned whether the
whites were not wholly deluded. There is evidence to
believe that there was no plot at all on the part of the
Negroes, although they suffered terribly.
Of that of 1816, in Camden South Carolina, discovered
and suppressed, Mr. F. G. Deliesseline writes: "Two
brothers engaged in this rebellion could read and write,
and were hitherto of unexceptionable characters. They
were religious, and had always been regarded in the light
of faithful servants. A few appeared to have been actuated by the instinct of the most brutal licentiousness,
and by the lust of plunder; but most of them by wild
and frantic ideas of the rights of man, and the misconceived injunctions and examples of Holy Writ "  E".

Further on Mr. Elliott remarks, -"Another impediment to, the progress of conspiracy, will ever be the
Jidelity of some of our Negroes. The servant who is
false to his master would be false to his God. One act
of perfidy is but the first step in the road of corruption
and of baseness; and those who on this occasion have
proved: ungrateful to their owners, have also been hypo.

remarks-- " On investigation it appeared that all concerned in that transaction, except one, had seceded
from the regutlar Methodist Church in 1817 and formed
a separate establishment, in. connection with the African
Methodist Society in Philadelphia; whose bishop, a colored man, named Alien, had assumed that office, being
himself a seceder from. the. Methodist Church of Pennsylvania. At this period Mr. S. Bryan, the local minister
of the regular Methodist Church in Charleston, was
so apprehensive of sinister designs, that he addressed a
letter to the city council, on file in the council chamber,
dated 8th November, 1817, stating at length the reasons
of his suspicion.'&gt;- Address, Note B. p. 20.
The South Hampton affair, in Virginia, in 1832, was
originated by a man under color of religion, a pretender
to inspiration. As far back as 1825 the Rev. Dr. J. H.
Rice, in a discourse on the injury done to religion by
ignorant teachers, warned the people of Virginia against
the neglect of the proper religious instruction of the
Negroes, and the danger of leaving them to the control
of their own ignorant, fanatical and designing preachers.OBLIGATIONS OF THE CHURCH.
His prophecy had its fulfilment in South Hampton. If
we refer to the West Indies we shall behold religion
exerting a restraining influence upon the people; and
particularly on one occasion all the Negroes attached to
the Moravian Missionary Churches, to a man supported
the authority of their masters against the insurgents.
Enough has been said to satisfy reasonable and Christian men that sound religious instruction will contribute
to safety. There are men who have no knowledge of
religion in their own personal experience, and who have
not been careful to notice its genuine effects upon servants, and they will place little or no confidence in any
thing that might be said in favor of it. They can place
more reliance upon visible preventives of their own invention than upon principles of moral conduct wrought in
the soul and maintained in supremacy by Divine Power,
whose nature they do not understand, and whose influence, however good, is invisible, and for that very reason
not to be trusted by them. Nor have they either the
candor or willingness, to make a distinction between
false and true religion. In their opinion the Gospel is
no benefit to the world. Such men we are constrained
to leave to the influence of time and observation, and
invoke for them the influence of the Spirit of God. I
shall never forget the remark of a venerable colored
preacher, made with reference to the South Harnpton
tragedy. With his eyes filled with tears, and his whole
manner indicating the deepest emotion, said he, " Sir, it
is the Gospel that we, ignorant and wicked people need.
If you will give us the Gospel it will do more for the
obedience of servants and the peace of community than
all your guards, and gulls, and bayonets." This same
Christian minister, on receiving a packet of inflammatory
215216     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
pamphlets through the Post-office, and discovering their
character and intention, immediately called upon the
Mayor of the City and delivered them into his hands.
Who can estimate the value in community of one such
man acting under the influence of the Gospel of peace?
The religious instruction of the Negroes will promote
our own morality and religion.
That the Negroes are intellectually and morally, in a
degraded state, I trust will not be denied; and of course
no man acquainted with human nature, will deny that
constant connection and intercourse with a degraded
people, will exert a deleterious influence upon persons
of more elevated character, if there be not some peculiar causes in existence, or some special effort made, to
counteract it. I do not hesitate to say that the influence
of the Negroes on the general intelligence and morality
of the whites is not good. There are those who deny
it. I differ with them, and am happy in believing that
the majority of my fellow citizens are with me. We
are so accustomed to sin in the Negroes (which in tllem
appaars a matter of course,) that our sensibilities are
blunted.
When we cease to " abhor that which is evil," we shall
not long "cleave to that which is good."  "First endure
-then embrace;" is as true in sober prose as in
flippant poetry. Planters will generally confess that
the management of Negroes is not only attended
with trouble and vexation from time to time, but with
provocations to sin. Masters and mistresses of families have their trials. And the kiind of influence which
Negroes exert over our children and youth, when permitted to associate with them, is well known to all
careful and observing parents.OBLIGATIONS OF THt CHURCH.
Now we shall defend ourselves from the injuries to
our moral and religious character, received through our
colored population, by their religious instruction, at
least in very large measure. And on the principle or
promise of the word of God, "he that waters shall be
watered also himself."  God bestows his blessing immediately upon those who do their duty. There is also a
rebound for good, in benevolent action. The effort to do
good, strengthens the principle from  wlich it proceeds.
The way to strengthen and increase holiness in the soul
is to abound in works of holiness. It is by giving our
talents to the exchangers that we gain other talents.
By taking in hand the religious instruction of the
Negroes, an ample field will be opened for the most vigorous exercise of the piety and zeal and talents of the
church; a great proportion of which is now rusting for
want of use. And when it pleases God to gi-ve success
to our labors, and we see them assuming a higher standard of morals; the current of their opinions turning
against ignorance and vice, their appearance and deportment becoming more respectable, we shall be favorably
affected ourselves. As the one class rises so will the
other; the two are so intimately associated they are apt
to rise or fall together; to benefit servants, evangelize
the masters; to benefit masters, evangelize the servants,
lI!uch  unpleasant discipline will be saved to the
churches.
The offences of colored communicants against Christian character and church order are numerous, and
frequently heinous; the discipline of delinquents is
wearisome, difficult, and unpleasant. Excommunications
are of frequent occurence: and are usually followed, a
short time after, by applications for re-admission. There

will never be a better state of things, until the Negroes
are better instructed in religion, both before and after
their reception into the church.
The souls of our servants zwill be saved.
This is the crowninlg benefit; the grand and final aim
of religious instruction. Where is the church in our
land that would refuse to have its number of elect ones
increased by the addition of these souls ready to perish?
Where is the mninister who would ref(ise to have them
for the crown of his rejoicing " in that day?"  Where
is the master who would keep the cup of salvation from
the lips of his own servants?
From the success which has attended the preaching of
the Gospel in its purity to the Negroes, we iinfer that the
"set time" to favor thlem has comei; and that the Lord
will succeed our faithlfill endeavors with the convertiing
and sanctifying  influelices of his Holy Spirit.  And
when we remetmber their multitudes - the hundreds and
thousands of immortal souls that are passing into an
eternity for which they are ullnprepred; and when we
remeinber their condlition and circlumstances in this
world, and iow nluch they stand in need of the supports
and consolations of religion, who thlat has a heart to
feel carl hesitate to forvward the work of their religious
instruction?'' All souls are mnine,' saith the Lord, and
his glory is promoted as well in the salvation of the soul
of anl African as in that of any other man of any other
country.
Without proceeding ftirther, suich are the benefits
which we slihouil( realize in thie slave-lholding States by

I can conceive of no ground whatever upon which to
found an objection to their religious instruction in the
free States; doubtless excuses may somnetimes be made,
but as they must arise generally from corrupt sources
and be of limited prevalellce, I shall pass them by. The
bencfits arising from their religious instruction have been
in some locations so manifest, anid tnust be so obvious to
all, more especially indeed to those who have made the
character and condition of the Negroes in the free
States a matter of serious reflection, that I shall in like
manner omit any notice of tliem.
I have now completed this Part of our subject. The
obligations of the churcli of Christ in the United States
to impart the Gospel to the Negroes I trust have been
demonstrated; the excuses and objections to a discharge
of those obligations stated and obviated; and the benefits
briefly yet sufficiently exhibited.PART IV.
MEANS and Plans for promoting and securing the
Religious Instruction of the Negroes in the United
States.
CHAPTER 1.
THE Church of Christ must be made familiar with the duty and
moved to its performance.
There is much ignorance, much indifference - indeed,
much apathy in the churches on the subject of the
religious instruction of the Negroes  This people have
never been brought up, as it were in a body, and presented to the churches, as a people demanding their
prayers and efforts for their salvation. We need an allpervading light and feeling in the churches on the subject. The work must begin in the house of God. Our
first effort therefore must be to briiig the spiritual condition and prospects of the Negroes in the United States
and our duties toward them, before the minds of Christians. They will then discover what is to be done, and
inquire how shall it be done?
I would in this place state distinctly that I see no
necessity for the formation of associations or societies
on an extensive scale embracing States, or even the
whole United States, with central boards, appointing
agents for the collection of funds and forming auxiliaries,
employing and appointing ministers and missionaries,
disbursing monies, in a word assuming the entire control
19*222   RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
of the great work. On the contrary I think I see some
verv strong objections to such a course, especially in the
Southlern States. It is unnecessary to offer these objections to the reader. Thle imrpracticability of forming
suchl associations and conductitng them with success, settles the question.
There are no objections to local associations, or
societies: formedl by the people interested, on the
ground itself which they propose to occupy. Such
associations, (the one in Liberty Country Georgia is an
example,) lave done and may (ldo great good, and are
always un(ler control of their own members and officers.
I conceive that the churches in their respective
organized forms are competent to undertake, and to
prosecute the work to complete success.  They are
associations for (loing good within themselves. Each
denomination has its regular and constitutional organization, antl can avail itself of that organization to execute
its plans of benevolence. If a denomination chooses to
appoint committees or boards and agents under prescribed regulations " over this business," there can be
no objection; it is this particular branch of the church
acting in its organized capacity still.
The various (lenominations in the Southern States, so
far as they have talien action on the religious instruction of the Negroes, have done so within themselves,
thereby intimating their competency to the work, and
expressing the opinion that no other organizations are
necessary.
The first movement, dictated by wisdom, should be
to bring the duty before the bishops, elders, and deacons,
of all the various denominations of Clhristians, and
through their instrumentality before church members
and communities,MEANS AND PLANS.
I would respectfully suggest the following as means
to this desirable end which have in certain instances
been use(l with success.
Let bishops, elders, and deacons, wvho have both
knowledge and interest on the subject, introduce it into
their respective church judicatories for7 consideration
and action. Consideration will produce conviction and
conviction action.
To illustrate the matter. At a meeting of a presbytery a member introduces the religious instruiction of
the Negroes, in a sermon or resolution,  in a report
on the state of religion within a particular clilrch or
within the b)oun(ls of the body. The presbytery entertains the subject; it elicits remark; il grows i- importance; the members feel that somethinlg must be done.
Thus introduced it is suiggested that they seek for more
information, andl it is move(d that the subject be committed, or some branch of it, to different members to
prepare reports, essays, or sermons, or dissertations,
that presbytery m;ty know more Itdfinitely thile nature
and extent of it.
The subject is then divided andl members are appointed
to prepare on such branches of it. as we now mention:
" A statistical report of the number of Negroes witlhin
the bounds of presbytery; the number statedly attending
public worship on the Sabbath day; and the number of
members in the several churches under the care of
presbytery."  " Their moral and religious condition;
and access to the means of grace."  "What is done
for their religious instruction,-by ministers- by
churches-by owners?"' What kind of instruction
is neededl; and the best mode of imparting it?" "Do
servants formn an integral part of a bishop's charge;

1680. Forty-four years after the settlement of Connecticut, the Assembly forwarded answers to the Inquiries of the Lords of the Committee of Colonies, wherein
they say: " There are but few servants and fewer slaves;
not above 30 in the colony. There come sometimes
three or four blacks from the Barbadoes, which are sold
for 221 each. Great care is taken of the instiuction
of the people in the Christian religion, by ministers
catechising and preaching twice every Sabbath and
sometimes on lecture days; and also by masters of
families instructing their chil(lren and servants, which
the law commands tlhenm to do."
1701. " The Society for the Propagation of'the
Gospel in _Foreign Parts," was incorporated munder
William III. oin the 16th (lay of of June 1701, and tlle
first meeting of the society under its charter was the
27th of June of the same year. Thomas Lord Bishop
of Canterbury, Primate and Metropolitan of all Englan.d was appointed by his Majesty tile first President.
This society was formed with the view, primarily,
of supplying the destitution of religiotus institutions and
privileges among the inhabitants of the North American
Colonies, members of the established church of England; and secondatrily, ofextending the Gospel to the
In(dians and Negroes.
It had been preceded by a company incorporated by
Chlarles II. in 1661, for " the Propagation of the Gospel
amongst Heathen Nations of New England and the
parts adjacent in America;" which, however, did
not accomplish much; the design, for the times, then
present and the necessities of the Colonies, being too
narrow. The Honorable Robert Boyle, was first President of this company, and' it was his connection withl
this society which led. himr to a deeper interest in the',224     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
and what ought he to do for them?" "The obligations of churches and of owners to impart the Gospel to
the Negxoes."  " The necessity of Sabbath schools
and the best plan for conducting them."
Other branches of the subject will suggest themselves.
I need not enlarge. These essays and reports, coming
in from meeting to meeting will keep the subject before
the presbytery, until a conscience is formed, enlightened
and active, and then a regular system of efforts will be
made from year to year, and the Negroes become the
permanent ob ects of Christian regard.
The presbytery will require its members to devote a
part of the Sabbath or some portion of the week to
their instruction; to bring the duty before the church
sessions and congregations and endeavor to establish
Sabbath schools for colored children and youth; and to
report the number of members, extent and nature of
efforts, and the success of them at every regular meeting
of the body.
Thus the interest awakened in presbytery goes down
to the church sessions and congregations within its
bounds, and the whole community is acted upon. And
again, through its reports to synod, the subject is introduced there, and being remarked, it is urged upon the
attention of synod, and the members are impressed,
(who form many presbyteries, covering a wide extent of
country,) and through the action of synod thousands are
affected. Upward the influence goes to the General
Assembly, and from thence it is caused to flow down
again over the length and breadth of the denomination,
besides attracting the attention of sister denominations
and enlisting them also in the work.MEANS AND PLANS.
Substantially the same action may pervade the
Baptist, Methodist, and Episcopal denominations, and
with equal results.
Another means of awakening churches will be to
publish essays, reports, sermons, and tracts on the
subject, and give them a circulation as universal as possible. They will be like the seed which "the sower
went forth to sow;" mucli of it will fall upon good
ground all over the country and effects both great and
small will be the fruit.
And still another means, should it be practicable as
well as advisable the particular denomination taking
the work in hand, may establish a committee or society
to superintend it, having some responsible individual
engaged to visit the churches and to assist in establishing
Sabbath schools, and to collect funds for the support of
missionaries of approved character in places where
they may be needed, and circulate information on the
best plans for conducting the religious instruction of the
Negroes.
By some such means as these the churches must be
made familiar with the duty and moved to its performance.
225226    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
CHAPTER I1.
THE ways and means of imparting religious instruction to the
Negroes.
OUR object should be to communicate the Gospel
which bringeth salvation, to the entire Negro population of the United States, embracing the ol(l and the
young, the bond an(l free. Tile Gospel s,hoild be communicated statedly, al regularly appointed seasons; and
these seasons occuring as frequently as possible, at least
once a week; and in an intelligible manner, "' for if the
trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for tlhe battle? "
The Gospel should be communicated in its fulness,
and every necesssary mna is used to that end; such as
Sabbath scho; for children and youth, in which adults
also may be inclu(led. Preaching to entire congregations on the Sabbath; at!rl on plantations during the
week; and where it is possible, hol(ling a weekly lecturie.

white members to atten(l to all persons applying for
admission, that they be not receive(l without (ldue examination and instruction; and finally, by planitation
in struction.
But who shall communicate the Gospel in this manner
to the Negroes? The question admits of an easy answer.
We look, first, to the bishops of chlurches.
In thef ee StatCs, if the Negroes have no distinct
churchi organization of their own, an(d are (lependent
upon the whites, the ministers under whose influence
they fall should make every suitable effort to improve
their moral an(l religious condition. There is no tie of
early association and of sympathy, nor of interest,
existing between the viwhites an(l the Negroes of the free
States; the prejudice against coloris very strong; the standing in society - tlhe character and( pecuniary reso,urces
of the Negroes, have no attractions; and many ministers
find it (lifficult to get their feelings interested, or to
make advances towards them. Andt what makes the
matter worse, is, that fiequerltly the Negroes are indepen(dent in their dleg:adation and spiritual necessities,
and look upon the efforts of the wvhites in the light of a
presumptuous interference with them and their own
concerns. In some of the chief towns there is a wide
field for benevolent effort amiong this people, and much
more ouight to be (lone for tlietn than is done.
In the slave States, the churches and congregations
are universally composed of Negroes and wllites-of
bond andl free; and ministels who are settletl over the
churches, are or oug,lt to be, settled over both classes.
Servants are as much a part of their charge as are
children. The churches are composed of households:
parents and children, masters and selvants; and ministers
227228    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
are in duty bound to watch over the whole; they are
responsible for the whole. And yet how many churches
employ their ministers, and never require them to give
any attention at all to the Negroes connected with them
and for whose religious instruction they are responsible
to God? They come and go from the house of God
month after month and even year after year, perfectly
satisfied and quiet in conscience, feasting upon the provisions of that house, and their dependent servants
starving for the bread of life! Yea, more, there are
ministers of the Gospel who conceive themselves settled
over the whites only, and are contented to have it so,
and make their weekly preparations, from one year to
another for them only; and the Negroes, although
needing far more their labors, and for whose religious
instruction they are responsible to God, are passed over!
Where such a course of conduct is persisted in, after
the light has been communicated for its reproof, it can
but be considered monstrous injustice, and an evidence
of a most defective, if not spurious Christianity.
Ministers settled over churchles in the slave States
should devote special attention to the colored portion of
their charge.
They should devote a portion. of each Sabbath to
regular preaching of the Gospel to the Negroes: and
at such time of the day as may be most convenient.
They will secure larger congregations on this day than
on any other, as it is the day of rest and religious
worship.
They should, where it is possible, give a lecture to
the Negroes, during the week on some evening; and in
the country, where this exercise cannot be had, let them
substitute, one or two plant ation meetings.  SuchMEANS AND PLANS.
meetings may be connected with their pastoral visitations to the white families, and thus do good to the
entire households. There are ministers who perform
their duties in this manner, and thereby secure the
warmest affections of their people. They should have
in their cllurches regular Sabbath schools for children
and youth and adults, which schools may be conducted
by elders or-deacons, or private members, and occasionally visited and catechised and addressed by themselves.
The great hope of permanently benefiting the Negroes
is laid in Sabbath scllools, in which children and youth
may be trained up in the knowledge of the Lord. Such
schools ought to be connected with every church in the
Southern Country; and with ordinary effort may be
kept up and conducted with success from year to year.
I am acquairnted with schools which have been in existence from seven to nine years, in which youthl have
grown up and married. Some continue after marriage
in the schools, and retaining their interest, bring their
little children wvith them. Those that leave, have their
places filled by children that have become old( enough
to go to school. And thus the schools retain their
usual number from year to year. The effect of them
has been to increase in a Iiigh degree the religious intelligence of the people generally; to benefit their manners; to improve their morals; elevate their character;
and makle them greater respecters of the Sabbath, more
regular in their attendance upon the public worship of
God; more mindful of the various duties of life; arind
when converted, more lasting and consistent members
of the church.
If a people are to be instructed orally, let the instruction be communicated to them in early life. It will

then do them most good; they will learn to use their
memories and their reasoning powers and be prepared
to profit by the more elevated services of Ihe sanctuary.
The amount of religious knowledge which may be communicated orally, can be conceived of by those only,
who have made the experiment.
We niay sonietimes witness zeal and effort expended
in keeping up in a church a Sabbath school of some fiftpen or twenty white children, while immediately around
and in connection with that church there are perhaps
one hundred and fifty, if not two hundred colored
children, growing up in ignorance and vice!  IIow
large an amount of religious instruction might be communicated to our colored population in the South, if in
every regular place of worslhip Sabbath schools for
colored children an(d youth could be originated and perpetuated? And how much good, and at how small an
expense of time and labor, might numbers of private
Christians in our churches accomplish (who now do
comparatively, if not absolutely nothing at all,) if they
would engage vigorously in schools of this character?
A field great and wile is opened in the South for the
establishment of Sabbath schools sufficient to employ
all our zeal and effort in the good cause. And why may
not ministers of the Gospel bring forward and present
the claims of this field?
In addition to the regular Sabbath schools now recom.
mended, ministers of churches ought to have stated
seasons for the gatherinrg togecther of all the colored
members, that they may form a rnore intimate acquaintance with them; and hold a conference of prayer and
exhortation, at which time suitable instruction in Christian doctrine and duties may be communicated to them.MEANS AND PLANS.
This is surely of great importance.  For whatever
pains may be taken to instruct candidates for church
membership, the almost universal practice is to leave
them to themselves after they become members, and no
further efforts are made to advance them in knowledge.
This is a great, a serious errol. They require as much
instruction after admission to the church as before.
At the seasons now spoken of let the colored children
of the church and congregation be assembled by the
pastors, for catechetical instructionr; let them be thus
assembled as often in the year as is convenient. It is
the duty of pastors to "feed the lambs; " nor should
Sabbath schools ever be made a substitute with pastors
for these catechetical exercises with the children and
youth of their cllarge.  7hey are to instruct, them and
become acquainted with thern, as lambs of their flock;
they are to teach the children to look up to them as
their spiritual guides and rulers. The judgment and
experierice of the churches have approved and recommended and established these exercises for children and
youth in all ages. If ministers are bound to assemble
the white children, they are equally bound to assemble
the colored children. This is the duty in churches of
all denominations, cspecially in those denominations
which hold to infant membership--the originlal and
only constitution which God l]as given to his church on
earth, in regard to its members - believers, together with
their infant children.
There are some churches in which the infant children
of colored members are regularly acknowledged by the
rite of baptism, and their baptisms are recorded and
preserved. The Episcopaleans are most faithful in this
duty. But it cannot be disguised that there are very
231232    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
many churches in which the duty in respect to the Negro
children, (however strictly it may be atten(led to in
respect to the white children,) is wholly neglected; and
for what reason it is impossible to say. Such churches
lay themselves open to the charge of inconsistency, as
well as want of proper regard for their colored memnbers, and by their neglect lose the opportunity of securing a greater amount of interest in, as well as of
instruction for, their children. It is the duty of these
churches to have the infant children of all their colored
members brought forward and baptized and enroledl, and
the children taken under the care and faithfill instruction of the pastors; and where the duties of pastors
and churches are properly fillfilled, the effects will be of
the happiest kind. The churches will present an example
to the world of consistency, unity, purity, and success.
Pastors should attend the funerals which occur in
their colored congregations and particularly in their
colored membership. They are children of affliction and
sorrow as well as others, and need as much the consolations of religion, and the sympathies of Christian
ministers and friends. It is cold, heartless, senseless
heathenism that neglects death, and yields no balm to
the wounded soul. But it is Christianity that invests
that event with importance and comes to wipe away the
tears of sorrow and bind up the broken heart. Our Lord
never neglected the poor in their affliction; and no
servant should be above his Lord.
They should also solemnize thcir marriages; and at
their own homes and at such times as may best suit their
convenience, for like the rest of mankind, they like to
see their friends in their own houses, and give them on
such joyous occasions, the best entertainment they canMEANS AND PLN'S.'4;
afford. Some ministers are in the habit of requiring for
their own convenience, the people to appear and be
married at the church. The consequence is,.tlley are
called upon very seldom; the people contrive to have
their marriages solemnized at home. Church marriages
are not more popular with the lower than with the higher
classes in society.
The formal solemnization of their marriages is of
great importance if their improvement in morals and
religion is the object sought after. The effect is to elevate and throw around the marriage state peculiar
sacredness. It is rendered "honorable in all."  Polygamy and licentiousness are rebuked and orerthrown.
Masters protect families more, and make greater efforts
to preserve them from separation.
That very great reforms can be made among the
Negroes, in the sacredness and perpetuity of their marriage relations, admits of no question, The experiment
has been tiied and proven.
Another duty required of ministers is that they attend
with their sessions punctually and diligently to the
discipline of colored members.
Their discipline amounts to nothing at all in some
churches, being left almost if not (altogether to their
colored watchmen; while in other churches it is most
shamefully neglected. Cases are reported, (docketed
or not as it may happen,) summarily disposed of, or
deferred from time to time, until they are forgotten and
never acted upon, or called up when it is too late to do
any good. Ministers with their sessions should feel in
duty bound to takle sufficient time and exercise sufficient
patience, and never 13t cases accumulate on hand, but
promptly dispose of them when they are in possession

defence and propagation of the Christian religion, and
he therefore left in his will an annual salary, forever, for
the support of eight sermons in the year, for proving
the Christian religion against notorious Infidels; and he
requires that the preachers employed, "' shall be assisting to all companies and encouraging them in any
undertaking for propagating the Christian religion in
Foreign Parts."
The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts entered upon its duties with zeal, being
patronized by the King and all the dignitaries of the
Church of England.
They instituted inquiries into the religious condition
of the Colonies, responded to "' by the Governors and
persons of the best note;" (with special reference to
Episcopacy,) and tlley perceived that their work " consisted of three great branches: the care and inlstruction
of our people settled in the Colonies; the conversion
of the Indian Savages; and the conversion of the
Negroes."  Before appointing Missionaries, they sent
out a traveling preacher, the Rev. George Keith, (an
itinerant missionary,) who associated with himself the
Rev. John Talbot. Mr. Keith preached between North
Carolina and Piscataquay river in New England, a tract
above 800 miles in length, and completed his mission in
two years, and returned and reported his labors to the
society.
The annual meetings of this society were regularly
held from 1702 to 1819 and 118 sermons preached
before it by Bishops of the Church of England, a large
number of them distinguished for piety, learning, and
zeal. The society still exists.
The efforts of the societyfor the Religious Instruction of the Negroes, are briefly as follows.

of all the necessary facts and testimony. The Negroes
stand as much in dread of church censures as any other
class of members, and discipline punctually and efficiently executed produces the most desitable results.
Ministers with their elders and (leacons should see to
it that conlmittees of instruction be appointed of the
best members, not excluding thenselves, to attend to
inquirers, and suspended and excommunicated members. The committee should be distribtuted at different
points in the congregations so as to suit the convenience
of the Negroes, that they may not have too great a distance to walk for instrnction. The churches also may
make a rule to receive no person for examination for
church membership, or foi ie-admission, who does not
come recommended by some one of the committee.
I would add once more, that ministers shoiuld endeavor to awaken their church members cspecially masters
and mistresses, to the great duty of affording suitable
instruction to the Negroes.
They will necessarily be obliged to preach on the
subject; an(d to converse on it in private. They ought
not to be satisfied with preaching and conversing, but
suggest plans and put the people upon an active discharge of duty and recommend and if necessary assist
them, in establishing plantation instruction, in the way
of weekly schools, and evening prayers. The work of
religious instruction lies neglected in many a region of
our country for no other reason than that those to whom
the people look for guidance, are silent and inactive.
Is it sai(l that this is imposing a great amount of
labor on ministers, in addition to their care of the other
class in their churches? Be it so. Is it imposing *
single thing more than wlat ouglht to be done for theMEANS AND PLANS.
Negroes? And are not ministers called in the Scripture, "laborers?"  What else lhave they to do, who
undertake pastoial charges, but to attend faithfully to
them? If they find they have undertaken too large a
charge let them seek a smaller one and give place to
some one more able to fill their station. If this be impossible, let them endeavor to procure assistants. If
the people will grant none, then malke a proper division
of time and efforts between both classes. Do something
-almost any thing is better than the dead calm of
indifference and idleness.
We are to look in the second place, to ministers of
the Gospel, employed as missionaries to the Negroes.
Thiere are extensive regions of country in the South
and South-west, especially those bordering upon river
courses an(l embracing river bottoms, and the most
fertile lands, whichi are inhabited by a dense population
of Negroes and by a small population only of lwhites,
(which, indeed, is almost wholly withdlrawn in the siclily
season of the year.)  Such regions, if ever to be supplied with the Gospel, must be supplied through the
instrumentality of missionaries.
The missionaries should be Southern men, or men no
matter from what country, yet identified in views, feelings and interests with the South, and who possess the
confidence of society. Such missionaries better understand the civil condition and relations of the Negroes
and their general circumstances, and are better qualified
to preach the Gospel to them.
Men who feel that they cannot preach the Gospel to
their fellow men, unless they are in some particular
civil condition, and to bring them into that condition is
with them more necessary than to bring them to Christ;
235236    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
and upon which all their preaching and teaching must
have a bearing to be in their estimation of any benefit;
are the most unfit men in the world to come among us.
Because they are, in the first place,. dangerous to the
peace and order of the country; and in the next place,
are ignorant of the first principles of Christianity which
is a religion adapted to mankind in all their various
conditions, and is primarily intended to secure the salvation of the soul. Men of this stamp are always restless,
fault-finding, impatient, unsuccessful ministers. I have
known such obtain settlements in the South, but remain
in them not long. They have left fields of great extent
for missionary and ministerial labor, and have become
wandering stars through one free State after another
and finally settled in obscurity. Some of them having
sold their servants and lands, and gathered all together,
have shaken the dust off their feet, andl becoine warm
opponents of slavery; but have found no more peace
than before. Such ministers have mistaken their own
case. Their difficulties are not external, they are internal.  Thle Southern people are, therefore, perfectly
right in requiring missionaries of proper character, and
not more with a view to their own peace, than to the
profitable instruction of the Negroes themselves. Such
individtals as would come under the garb of ministers
and inculcate insubordination, and while they say to
owners, "art thou in health my brother?" aim direct
yet covert blows at their peace and prosperity, if not
their very existence, are incendiaries of the worst order
and for whonl the laws provide very summary justice?
To supply the wants of the Negroes in the Southern
States, large numbers of missionaries are required, but
where shall they be obtained, and how shall they beMEANS AND PLANS.
supported? Both melancholy questions, for they admit
of no satisfactory answer. "The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the
Lord of the harvest tllat he will send forth laborers into
his harvest."  Such is our Lord's command. We have
not missionaries in sufficient numbers to supply the destitute white population; we have churches able in part,
if not altogether able, to support their own ministers,
which find it difficult to obtain them. Yet, as in the
business world, if a demand is created for an article it
will shortly be produced to the extent of the demand, so
is it in the religious world. If a demand for missionaries be created, a supply will be obtained. The experience of the church in other fields of missionary labor
has demonstrated the fact.
We may, therefore, proceed to show how missionaries
to the Negroes may be employed and supported and this
may be the direct mode of finding out where they are to
be procured.
By domestic missionary societies; which exist in,
perhaps, all the denominations. The funds which are
contributed in the churches and by individuals, mnay be
judiciously applied to the support of missionaries to the
Negroes, as well as to the whites, and for the support of
ministers in feeble churches, to which numbers of
Negroes are attached.  The particular denomination
employing missionaries through its own society will be
responsible for the same. Missionaries are now under
the employ of such societies in the South.
By presbyteries, associations, conferences, and convocations, without the agency of arny society.
The contributions are taken up in the churches and(
collections made by order of the church judicatory acting
237238     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
in the premises, and it appoints and is responsible for
the missionaries. Some presbyteries and associations
adopt this plan, and it succeeds very well. There are
but few, indeed, of our church judicatories which could
not, with suitable effort, support at least one if not more
missionaries to the Negroes in such parts of their bounds
as may need them.
By one, or more churches uniting their contributions.
Some churches, which for the wealth they contain,
and the large annual income of their members, are of
themselves abundantly able to support a minister for the
white part of the congregation, and a minister for the
colored par'. And where the labor of attending to both
classes is too great for one minister, they ought to have
another. There are churches in no inconsiderable numbers, having a net income of from fifteen to fifty, and
from fifty to eighty thousand dollars reckoning in members of the churches and congregations, and yet which
aive frotn five hundred to a thousand dollars for the support of one minister only; and that minister having
within reach, fromffteen hundred to three thousand Negroes!- Surely the spiritual wants of the Negroes,
should be attended to.
Two or mnore clhurches, of one or more denorninations
contiguous to each other, might unite and support a missionary to the Negroes connected with theln; and the
expense would be comparatively light upon each.
By one or more planters, employing and supporting a
Missionary for their own people.
There are some planters, and some estates, whose
immense incomes warrant the eniployment of a religious
instructor from year to year.  For example, there are
net incomes, realized by individual proprietors, and byMEANS AND PLANS.
estates, varying from ten to thirty thousand dollars, out
of which there is not contributed for the, religions instruction of the Negroes, and I mean their own Negroes,
over tweuty-five orfifty dollars, or perhaps one hundred;
and from some of these large incomes, not one cent!
And the Negroes, whose labor is thus profitable, are in
want of the word of life!
On such large plantations, as a mere matter of gain,
a religious instructor should be employed.
By planters in the same neighborhood uniting, the
support of a missionary is rendered light.  Fix the salary of the missionary at five hundred dollars; and ten
planters at fifty dollars each, will pay it.  The board of
the missionary if he be a single man might be given to
him by the different families; or locating with his family in some central point, by presents of provisions, Iiis
living might be made cheap. The missionary thus employed could visit every plantation once in two weeks,
catecliise the children and preach to the adults, besides
meeting all the plantations on the Sabbath, either at one
or more stations, and in like manner carry forward his
work of preaching and catechising.
I am persuaded that this is one of the most economical and successful plans of planters' supplying their peo.
ple with adequate religious instrucion. They employ
the men; they know their character and qualifications;
they regulate their operations; they cointrol every thing.
We are to look in the thirdplace, to owners themselvzes,
to commsunicate the Gospel to the Negroes.
Pious owners are intended; we cannot expect the
duty to be performed by those who are not pious. Should
both lieads of the household be pious, so much the better; if one only, whether it be the master or mistress,
much may be done.
239240     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
[I] The owner should impress upon his people the
great duty of attending public worship on the Sabbath,
and should use every proper effort to induce them to
do so.
Frequent conversations with delinquents will have a
good effect; and where it is necessary, suitable clothes
should be given for the purpose.
~[2] He should also, where a Sabbath school is conducted in his neighborhood, make all the children and
youtlh attend punctually. To secure this end, let them
be given in charge of some responsible person on the
plantation on Sabbath morning to take them to church.
In the absence of the owner or manager, let the driver
be instructed to send the children. As they are careless
with their clothing, and as parents neglect frequently to
wash and to mend for them, it would be well for owners
to supply the children with a suit to be worn only on
the Sabbath, which might be kept either by parents or
given in charge of some careful person.
[3] Theplantation should be brought under religious
influences, and the physical condition of the people be
improved.
The owner, in order to success in the religious
instruction of his people, must in all his intercourse and
treatment of them exhibit the spirit of religion; otherwise his people will have no confidence in him and no
respect for his efforts.
Let him begin with the improvement of their physical
condition. Let him furnish them with convenient and
comfortable houses; properly partitioned off, and well
ventilated, and neatly whitewashed, and sufficiertly large
to accommodate the families resident in them; and
furnished with necessary articles for house hold use.MIEANS AND PLANS.
Each house should also have a small lot for a garden,
poultry yard, apiary, an(l other purposes, attached to it.
Indepen(lent of this lot, the families should have as much
ground to plant for themselves during the year as they
can profitably attend; and also the privilcge of raising
poultry and hogs; indeed every privilege and opportunity allowed them to make tllemselves comfortable
an(l to accumulate money. The greater the interest
which they hlave at stake on the plantation, the greater
security fortheir good behavior, and the greater prospect of their moral improvement.
I know plantations upon wvhich in(lustrious men improving their opportunities, sell during the year poultry,
stock, an(I produce of their own raising, to the amount
of thirty, fifty, and a hun(dred dollars.
The clothing of the people, both adults and children,
should be attended to, and a proper care of their clothing
reqiuire(l of all. HIabits of neatness about their houses
and lots, and personal cleanliness, slhould be insisted on.
The provisions of the plantation should be sound

each other, against the laws of God and good neighborship with other plantations, sllould be punished as well
as against the authority and interest of the owner.
While punishments slioultl be justly metedl out, so
ought also rewards. And the rewards should be such
as consists with the means of the owner. A familiar
acquaintance with the character and circumstances of
each servant will enable the owner to judge what kind
of rewar(ds would be most agreeable and advantageous.
There are many, who in their government, very much
neglect the fact that while they are "a terror to evil
doers," they should also be "a praise to tllem that do
well."  The sick shouldl be strictly attendled to.  But
impositions from cases of feigned sickness, as strictly
guarded against. Religion is no hiding place for laziness

The owner shouldl, fuirthermore, inquire into and

kindness, justice, virtue; and punish overt acts of
iniquity committed between themselves.

other; neglect of the aged and sick; cruel acts towards
dumb beasts; adultery and fornication; yea, all sins and
improprieties existing among them should be observed
and corrected. The feeling of some that they may do
and live among themselves just as they please, if they
will only do their work, belongs neither to humanity nor
Christianity,MEANS AND PLANS.
There should also, be a house erected or some suitable
room, always at command in tile evening and on the
Sabbath day, for a place of worship for the people on
the platitation.  What they fiamiliarly call " the prayer
house."  Let there be a desk or stand for the books and
lights, and good seats witha backs, and sufficient room.
Let it be a comfortable place, in winter as well as in
summer; and the style of its fixing up, stich as will
indicate a respect for religion and religiots people.
In this prayer house, the everling prayers of the plantation; the plantation Sunday school; and the regular
services of mrissionaries or miinisters, may be conducted.
It certainily, to say the least, looks mlost ulifavorable for
the character of owners, to go upon their plantations,
-some of them extensive, in fine order, wvell fille(d up
with houses of all kinds and for all purposes, and not
even a small room appropriated to religious uses! The
Negroes are crowded inrto one of their owvn houses, too
small for their accommnodation, on whichl account many
do not atternd prayers; and should thle minister or missionary come, lhe is taken into some out house, prepared
for the occasion, badly seated and cheerless at best; or
the Negroes are taken into the house of the owner,
where they are not sufficiently at home to be at ease.
God has no tabernacle to dwell in on such plantations; and the Redeemer has not where to lay his head!
It is the duty of every Christian master to see that his
people are accommodated with a place of worship. A
neat little chapel, with its tower or steeple and bell, while
it is an ornament to a plantation, gives an air of stability
and sobriety to it, awakens religious associations in the;
minds of the people, and produces the best of inifluences.
24310     RELIGIOIUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
In June 1702 the Rev. Samuel Thomas, the first
missionary, was sent to the Colony of South Carolina.
The society designed he should attempt the conversion
of the Yammosee Indians; but the Governor, Sir
Natlianiel Johnson, appointe(l him to the care of the
people settled on the three branches of Cooper river,
making Goose creek his residence. He reported his
labors to the society, and said t' that he had talien much
pains also in instructing the Negroes, and learned 20 of
them to read. He died in October 1706.
Dr. LeJeau succeeded him in 1706, and found " parents
and masters indued with much good will aind a ready
disposition to have their children and servants taught the
Christian religion."  " He instructed and baptised many
Negroes and Indian slaves." His communicants in 1714
arose to 70 English and 8 Negroes. Dr. LeJeau died
in 1717, and was succeeded permanently by Rev. Mr.
Ludlam, who began his mission with great dilligence.
" There were in his parisli a large number of Negroes,
natives of the place, who un(lerstood English well; he
took good pains to instruct several of them in the piinciples of the Christian religion and afterwar(ls admitted
them to baptism. He said if the masters of them would
heartily concur to forward so good a work, all those who
have been born in the country might without much difficulty be instructed and received into the churchl. Mr.
Ludlam continued his labors among the Negroes and
every year taught and baptised several of them; in one
year eleven, besides some mulattoes."
T'he Indian war checked the progress of the society's
missions for several years. The Parishes of St. Paul's,
(1705,) St. John's, (1707,) St. Andrew's and St. Bartholomew's, (1713,) St. lHelen's, (1712,) received missionaries. Mir. Ilasell was settled in the last named parish,241    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
[4] The owner must undertake the religious instruction
of the people, himself.
As our hiope of permanently benefiting any people by
religious instruction, lies in bringing children and youth
statedly and constantly under it, the owvner must collect
his Negro children, and with some suitable book, carry
forward their iiistruction fronm year to year. Let them
be collected into a school, and taught for a short time
daily, or twice or three timnes duritng the week, or on
Sabbath evening; either by himself, his wife, or some
member of the family. Tile children being required to
come with clean faces and hands, their hair combed, and
clothes in good order, and to behave quietly, and be attentive and obedient, soon relish the exercise and improve
under it in disposition, manners, appearance, intelligence
and morality. The, master thus early becomes acquainted
with tthe tempers and characters of the chlildren and
takes them thus early under discipline, and much trouble
is saved in after life. Viewed merely as auxiliaries to
plantation ord(er and discipline tlhey are of the first importance. The effect of these schools upon parents
also, is highly beneficial. They feel grateful for the
pains taken by their owners with them, and exhlibit gratification and pride in their improvenment. They endeavor
also to fulfil their owvn duties to tlhemt better.
Having thus taken the children under instruction, he
must not omit the adults.
With these he can meet every evening, or as frequently
as possible in the prayer house. At the ringina of the
bell, let teacher and people be punctual, and the czercises
pointed and short. For example a portion of scripture
read, with a few leading questions asked which will serve
to keep up their attention, aiid a remark or two foundedMEANS AND PLANS.
on the passage; then a hymn; and the whole c'osed
with prayer; but not with lo!ng prayer. Thle time not
exceeding twenty or tweity-five nminutes. The adults
(by varying the exercises,) may and indeed, ought to be
taugllt, the Lord's prayer, the teln commandmenlts, the
creed and hytnns, and instructed in singing. It will be
proper also to take them through some catechism.
Connected witlh this instruction the owner shoul(l as
occasion offers or at regular times, cotnverse privately
with the people on the great subject of their souls' salvation.'Thle members of the church should receive his
special attention.  Thley may also be put undler the
watch of some one of their own color of approved discretion and piety, who may report their general conduct
from  time to time. Whenever there are any under
serious impressions, or hopeJully converted, and are desirous of uniting with the church of God, particular pains
should be taken to have them properly instructed. These
are golden opportunities not to be omitted.
It will be the duty of the owner also, should he be a
believer in the infant membership with the visible church
of God, of the children of believers, to have the children
of such of his servants as are coinnected with his own
church regularly presented in the assembly of God's
people and baptized. Such baptisms should be recorded
by the church and he ought also to make a record of
them, as well as of the baptism of the other chlildren of
his household. Ile should stand with the parents in
that interesting and solemn moment and the children
thus baptized should be under hlis special care and
instruction, and no means in his power should be left
unused to perfect as far as possible that religious educa.
tion which he is under obligations to afford thenm.
21*
211674A     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
It is much easier to nealect this duty than to perform
it: and many shrink from the responsibilities imposed
upon them by their own faith; and while they seriously
neglect the spiritual interests of their people, they lay
themselves and their church also, under the charge of
great inconsistency. The Lord said of Abrahlam -" for
I know him, that lie will command his children and his
household after him, and they shall keep the way of the
Lord, to do justice and juldgment; that the Lord may
brilng upou Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
-Gcn. 18: 19. It is the faitlhfulness of the head of the
householdc, which causes God to bring upon him, the
fulness of h-jis covenant blessings: "I will be a God to
thee and to thy seed alter thee."
But the owner, perhaps, interposes some objections to
the duties now required of him. Some of thlese were
considered in the TAlird Part of this work, and the
reader is referred back to them.
The owner objects to the amount of labor and care
involved in reli(ious instruction  conducted as now
recommended. It would make the master the greatest
servant on his owtn plantation.
The instances are extremely rare of a man's over
working himself in thl-is department of benevolent action,
and I do not apprehend any danger from unfolding to
owners the entire roun(l of their oblirgations and duties
to their servants, on that score. Canl the owner place
his finlger upon a single thing recommended which would
be better dispensed witlh than performed: or which does
not appear to be Ihis duty at all?
Looking at the gross, the amount appears, large, and
is indeed large. But all the labors and cares and duties
do not occur on one day, nor any two of them at oneMEANS AND PLANS.
particular moment of time. They lie along the track of
time, and the owner takes them up in the order of their
occurrence.- And if he be a man of system and energy
he will have a place for every thinc and every thing in
its timne, and although he may not accomplish all he
desires or undertakes, yet he will accomplish a great
deal, to the satisfaction of his own mind and conscience
and to the peace and comfort of Iiis people.
When a master is iinpressed with his obligations to
his servants, and acts in view of eternity, he will find
himself strengthened and made willing not only to undertake but to do a great deal for them. It should, however,
not be disguised that that planiter who undertakes the
religious instruction and moral imnprovement of his people, must look upon it in the light of a labor. He
necessarily undergoes, at least for a time, greater trials
and expense, than the planter who does not. IIe is
obliged to correct all the bad habits of government, all
the debasing thoughts in relation to the Negroes which
may unconsciously prevail in hinmself. He is obliged to
correct what is manifestly wrong in his own deportment
on Ihis plantation, and to live up to that Christianity
which he would teach. Thuts one grand means of
elevating Ihis owvn moral and reli(rious clharacter will be
an attempt to improve that of liis servalrts! But this
self-discipline is laborious and painful. And further, in
promoting the moral improverent of his people, as
already remarked, lie must improve thcir p7hysical condition - an almost intermintiable work. In the progress
of Ihis efforts the master will have painfil evideiice of the
idleness, carelessness, ignorance, deceit, and degradation
of Ihis servants. Ile will experience disappointments
and mortifications in respect to servants whom he deemed

the most virtuous, honest, and obedient. He may even
encounter opposition to moral reform from some of them.
They may sport with his instructions, pervert his motives, corrupt thle children and youth, and be guilty of
improprieties on purpose to irritate an(l in(luce him to
forego his attempt to bring the plantation under religious
influence, to which their natural feelings are opposed.
These are difficulties and trials, but ought not to deter a
master from doing his duty.
There are planters who think that they confer afavor
on their people ly giving them  instruction. It is a
favor in orie sense, but not in another - st! ictly speaking he who discharges his duty to another confers no
favor. They tliink also that tl,ey confer a favor on the
minister or missionary, by granting lhim permission to
preach on their plan,ations. Religious instruction is
that wich they may give or withhold according to their
good pleasure. There must be an enitire revolution in
the views and feelings of such owners before they will
conscientiously undertake and prosecute the religious
instruction of their people.
We are to look in the fourth place to elders and lay
men., to afford religious instruction to the Negroes.
Elders and laymen, of goodl spirit and qualifications,
in churches destitute of pastors or stated supplies, might
originate and continue Sabbath schools and Sabbath
instruction for the Negroes as well as for the whites.
They Iniglht also, by some arrangement visit a plantation once a week and hold evening prayers with the
people. They might read an(l expound a portion of
Scripture, and converse with the members of the church

most valuable auxiliaries. There have been associations
whose members have for some considerable time exerted
themselves with self-sacrifice in doing goo(l in this
manner.
The instruction of the Negroes by missionaries, by
owners, and by elders and laymen of tile church, is
liable to many (lelays and interruptions, and in the present state of the work and the subject in our country, our
main dependence must be upon the settled pastors and
stated supplies of our churches: and I venture to speak
further on this point, at the risk of repetition.
The churches should convert their pastors, somewhat
into missionaries, and they would then provide, with
little or no a(lditional expense, permanent instruction
for the Negroes.  The religious itnstruction of the
Negroes properly and officially devolves, and in large
measure, depends upon settled pastors; and if all
pastors and stated supplies in the several denominations
would perform their (duty to the Negroes attached to
their congregations, there would be comparatively
speaking, over immense tracts of country, but little need
of missionaries; religious instruction woiild pervade the
South, the reproach of the neglect of our colored
population, wotlltl be wiped away, and blessings temporal and eternal be conveyed to thousands now rea(ly to
perislh. It is an encouraging fact that pastors are directing their attention to this field more than ever, and that
our young ministers when they settle, seem disposed to
devote, and that conscientiouslv, a reasonable portion of
their time to the colored part of their charges.

CHAPT EIR III,
THE Manner in which the Gospel should be communicated to the
Negroes, so as to meet the character, condition, and circumstances
of the people. - Conclusion.
THE concluding chapter I shall throw into distinct
heads, embracinlg several particulars relating to the
religious instructon of the Negroes, which could not
with propriety be introduced before.
1. AIanner of Preaching.
As preaching depends upon the preacher, it will not
be amiss to inquire u'hat kind of preachers are needed
for the Negroes?
Certainly not ignorant preachers. It is the opinion
of some, that any body will (do to preach to the Negroes,
which is an erroneous opinion - tile child of ignorance
itself. No inconsi(lerable a part of that misery into
which the fall brought mankind, is a darkened understanding.  It is not more true that "the vorld( lieth in
wickedness," than that they have "the understanding
darkened being alienated from the life of God through
the ignorance that is in tlem." There is the blindness of
the mind and the hardness of the heart; and they act
and re-act the one upon the other. Our Lord has taughtMEANS AND'PLANSo
us also, that men "love darkness rather than light;"
-this very state of blindness and haidness. They do
not like to "retain God in their knowledge." Hence
the more ignorant they are of God the more wicked
they are. Andt the more ignorant and wicked, the
greater the difficulty of enlightening and elevating thenm.
It will be seen that the difficulty is increased a thlousand
fold, when the onlv access which the people lhave to the
light, is throtgh the livinlg teacher.
The primary work of a minister is to dissipate this
natural blindness of men's minds in respect to God, by
pouring in upon them in the most suitable manner, "the
light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face
of Jesus Christ," and in this way quickening the conscience and moving the heart. Tro put men to this work
who are not only unlearned but ignorant, is to put the
blind to lead the blind; and as a result, "both shall fall
into the ditch." Shallow vessels are soon emptied.
When the watchmen are blind -are all ignorant; they
quickly become dumb dogs, that cannot bark. They
become weary with their own noise, and ashamed of the
little impression they imake upon men; - their intellects
are stagnant. They are mere dreamers in knowledge,
and a spirit of intlifference and inefficiency creeps over
them, and they are "lying down, loving to slumber."Isa. 56: 10, 11. Our Divine Lord is the great teacher
that has come from God, and ever has been and ever
will be the "light of the world. Ilis ministers after
him he calls and requires to be "' the light of the world."
"To be instructed unto the kingdom of heaven;" and
he sends them unto their fellow men, "to open their
eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from
the power of Satan unto God."--John 1: 4. 3: 2-19.
8: 12. Matt. 5: 14. 13: 52. Acts 26: 17, 18.
251IRELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES,
We need for the continued and successful instruction
of the Negroes, as well educated and as intelligent ministers ancd as good preachers as the churches can supply.
It is the experience of all those who can lay claim to
these qualifications, who have entered upon the work of
the religions instiuction of the Negroes, that instead of
requiiing less talents and learning,they have needed more
than they possessed, and that they found the benefit of
all the knowledge they had acquired. Some preachers,
really ignorant anti unfLurnished for their office, quickly
expending their stock,tf knowledge, and exhausting all
their manceuvres and invention to keep the people interested, have first been deserted by the people, and then
have deserted themselves.  Others, well qualified in
every respect, setting their standard of sermonizing and
of intellectual effort lo'w, have thought " any sort of a
sermon" would do for the Negroe,., and the Negroee
have been wise enough to estimate their powers upon
their own showing, and proud enough not to be put off
with any sort of a sermon, and have therefore stayed
at home or gone where they have thought they could do
better. The preachers in the mean wliile have won(dered
at the falling off in their congregation- at the carelessness, hardness and inlifference of the Negroes, and
have perhaps given over effort, saying "it is of no use;
they will not come," their consciences perfectly satisfied
and at rest, " they have (lone \wvhat they could!"
Mllinisters in preaching to the Negroes, sometimes
say, " they cannot interest them; they lhave no turn for
it; thiey cannot make themselves understood."  They
have felt like exclaiming with Dr. Chalmers on a certain
occasio(n, zwhen laboring to put the inhabitants of Kilmany in p)ossesion of some of his ideas, " I would make
it plainer to you if I could!"
252MEANS AND PLANS.
No one will deny that an acquaintance with the character, condition, and circumstances of a people, and
some practice in addressing them, are highly advantageous to him who preaches to them. But it is the duty
of ministers to attain to a thorough understanding of the
doctrines and duties of Christianity, and to cultivate
such a facility of expression and of language, as to be
able to unfold both doctrines and duties intelligibly to
the weakest hearer. When a minister is not able to do
the latter, he may be suspected of not having attained
the former. The knowledge of some men is general and
indistinct. They are able to say much on subjects, call
them by their right names, and use the ordinary phraseology; but are not masters of the subjects th6mselves,
so that they can take them to pieces, show the different
parts and put all together again. One boy. draws his
figure, demonstrates his problem, and thinks he understands it perfectly. Now take his book away and rub
out his lines and letters, and set him to the demonstration
and call upon him for the principles upon wllich the
problem is constructed, and he is at fault after taking
but one or two steps. Another boy takes the problem
into his mind, lays hold of the thing itself; gets entire
possession of it, and is able to demonstrate it, in any
manner desired, resolve it into its first principles, and
construct it again. This is but an illustration of what
we meet with in theological studies. The nomenclature
of the science is acquired;, the order of subjects; and
general notions of doctrines, and not much more. The
preacher may perhaps interest what he terms enlightened
audiences, but when required to analyze truth and present it in a plain way to plain people he cannot do it.
The more he explains and defines, the mole visible

and the inhabitants were "565 whites, 950 Negroes, 60
Indian slaves, andl 20 free Negroes."
Rev. Gilbert Jones was appointe(l missionary of
Christ Church Parish, 1711. He used great pains to
persuade the masters and mistresses to assist in having
their slaves instructed in the Christian faith; but found
this good work lay under difficulties as yet insuperable.
He wrote thus concerning this matter: "6 Though laboring in vain be very discouraging, yet (by the help of
God,) I will not cease my labors; and if I shall gain but
one proselyte, shall not think much of all my pains."
He was succeded in 17'22 by Rev. Mr. Pownal. Two
years after he reported in his parish 470 free born, and
6" above 700 slaves, some of which understand the English tongue; but very few know any thing of God ox
religion."
In tile parish of St. George, taken out of St. Andrew's,
the church stan(ls 28 miles from Charleston, (1719,) Mr.
Peter Tustian was sent missionary, but soon removed to
Maryland. The Rev. Mr. Varnod succeeded him in
1723. A year after his arrival, at Christmas, he hal
near 50 cornmunicants, and what was remarkable, 17
Negroes.
He baptised several grown persons, besides children
and Negroes, belonging to Xlexander Skeene, Esquire.
The Rev. Mr. Taylor, missionary at St. Andrew's parish
in South Carolina, reported to the society " the great
interest taken in the religious instruction of their Negroes
by Mrs. Ilaige and Mrs. Edwards, and their remarlkable success; 14 of whom on examination he baptised."
The clergy of South Carolina, in a joint letter, acquainted the society with the fact 1" that Mar. Skeene, his lady,
and Mrs. Hlaige, his sister, did use great care to have
their Negroes instructed and baptised."  And the Rev.

becomes the darkness of his own mind. He takes a
passage of scripture and studies it; thinks he understands it; rises in the desk to deliver an exposition of
it; but he does not succeed, and he cannot tell why.
The general deportment of the minister to the Negroes
deserves attention. He should have reference to the
character, condition, habits and feelings of the Negroes.
His address and intercourse should be polite, frank,
condescending and uniformly kind, and at the same time
independent. Self-respect and the honor of the Gospel
will dictate these virtues, and the people will quickly
discover and rightly appreciate them. In order to secure
the confidence and respect of the people, he must treat
thent with respect and manifest in word and in deed his
interest in them. Whining and simperiidg, familiarity
and a. curting of popularity will destroy his influence.
He must speak and be accessible to all, and foraet not
to extend charity as occasion offers, to the old and
infirm. He should notice the children and youth a
great deal, cultivate their acquaintance and the acquaintance also of the more prominent, pious, and influential
members of the church and congregation. Scrupulously
avoid personal disputes and quarrels with them, and be
no party in such troubles between them. Act prudently,
hear both sides, decide justly, and show the reasons for
the decision. He should avoid making himself the
repository of tales and difficulties between individuals
and on plantations, and hear no tales at all respecting
owners and matters which belong to their civil condition.
-Luke 12: 13- 14.
He should be among them as their spiritual adviser,
guide, and friend, and let the people look up to him as
their minister. He should put himself to inconvenienceMEANS AND PLANS.                  255
to meet their calls for his services, in timnes of sickness,
at weddings and at funerals; show them that he is their
friend, and is neither ashamed of them nor-their service.
His language should be as pure Saxon; as he can make
it: and not accommodated in any degree whatever to their
broken English, if lie would escape contempt.
The minister to the Negroes should pay attention to
the 7manner, style, and character of his pre(iching.
His manner should be grave, solemn, dignified, free
from affectation, hauteur, or familiarity, yet ardent and
animated. The people like gestures but not grimaces.
His manner should be respectful. He should not endeavor to impress them with the fact, (should he unfortunately believe it himself,) that there is an infinite distance
between him and them, and between his intelligence and
theirs; aind that he has humbled himself amazingly to
take their instruction into his hands. He must not treat
them as if they were a parcel of children, or a people
perfectly stupid. Poor people have feelings as well as
rich people; and if people are ignorant, and, if you
please, fools, yet they do not lilie to be told of it. No
good comes of it. It is enough for the minister to know
what they are; let him go on and make them  better.
Nor must he be perpetually scolding and fault-finding, if
they happen to come a little late to church, if a door
slams, if a dog comes in, if a child cries, if a man sleeps,
if they do not pay tindivided attention, and so on.  No
people are perfection. Great allowances are to be made
for the Negroes; and many things wrong among them
may be owing to the minister himself. He on the corntrary ought to proceed upon the principle of kind encouragement -they greatly need it; and he shoul(l remark
and praise all that he sees commendable. Praising a256     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
virtue is a condemnation of the opposite vice; and in
many in-stances is the most effectual mode of condemning it. Encouragement stimulates a people to effort,
and when they see that their minister notices and commends their efforts they will exert themselves the more.
It would do some ministers a great deal of good to read
frequently 1st and 2d Thessalonians. They might learn
how highly they ought to think of God's people, and how
much they ought to praise them for their works of falith
and labors of love; and how proper it is to deal in kind
encouragement.
Style and character of preachiing. Sermons should
be plain in language, simple in construction, and pointed
in application, and of any length from a half hour to
an hour and a quarter, according to the subject and the
interest of the people. Like all other hearers, they have
no objection to tong0 sermons if they be good sermons
and treated well. The reasoning in the sermons may
be logical and close, if abstract propositions and learned
arguments are excluded, andl the reasoning sliort and
made evident by illustrations, which is no very hard
matter, if a man understands himself what he wislies to
teach to ot-hers. As to the subjects of sermons, they
may embrace the whole round of the cloctrines and duties
of Christianity; dwelling chiefly upon those most applicable to the people. There is not a single doctrine,
however elevated, or as some express it, deep and mysterious, which may not be profitably exhibited. In my
opinion the preacher with proper pains can speedily carry
them, iignorant as they are conceived to be, to the limits
of our actual knowledge of the doctrines of Christianity;
and what is more, make them know and feel it. The
human mind, if I may so express myself, is consciousMEANS AND PLANS.
when it arrives at the boundaries of religious truth, and'
is there disposed to stop; though pride and impiety, and
subtle leaders may tempt it to cross them. A little black
boy returning from Sabbath school was asked by his
little master, what he had been learning. He answered,
I have been learning about God. And what did you
learn about God? Why, that he made me. And what
else did he make? le made all things. Then Eaid his
little master-but who made God?    He replied, no
body. How then did God come at all    Why, he did
not come at all: somebody must befirst and begin every
thing; and that must be God. But how can God befirst
and begin every thing? The little black boy answered,
finally, " I do n't know; but it must be so; and't is so."
To make my meaning plain that the most elevated
doctrines niay be exhibited, and profitably exhibited, to
ignorant and illiterate people (which certainly is the
duty of every faithful steward of God,) and that in the
way of illustration, suppose I wished to bring forward the
doctrine of electio.:: that God is the author of our salvation and bestows it utpon whom he pleases? I would take
up the history of the Apostle Paul, and show who and
what he was before his conversion; and that out of his
own mouth. Next, show when and whlere and how he
was converted: that the thought or wish o-f becoming a
Christian never had entered his mind: that he was smitten to the ground by the brightness of the glory of the
Lord Jesus, in the full career of his iniquity: and that
God overpowered him by his Spirit, and shined into his
heart, to- give him the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. And last of
all, I would show' that there was the mlost wonderful and
perfect change wrought in the man, which continued to

his dying day; and that, as Paul himself tells us, it was
wrought in him by God; ind for no reason whatever, but
that it was the good pleasure of his will. Who can
resist the force of the truth thus presented? Who can
resist the inference and application?  The same way
which God took to bring this chief of sinners into his
kingdom is the same way he takes to bring all sinners
into his kingdom. The reason which moves him in one
case moves him in all. The reason is in himself. " Even
so Father for so it seerneth good in thy sight!" "Not
unto us, O Lord, but unto thy name be all the glory."
Suppose again I wished to bring forward "free agency
and accountability; there is the history of Judas: or
1" that election to eternal life, includes the means thereto,"
there is the shipwreck of Paul; or, "the divinity and
humanity of Christ - two natures in one person; " there
is the storm at sea and many other of his wonderful
works; or, "justifcation by faith alone," there is the
penitent thief, who had not righteousness enough to save
him from deathl at the hands of men, much less, at the
hands of God. And thus I rpight enumerate every doo.
trine and duty of the Holy Scriptures, with their appropriate and striking illustrations. The doctrines are thus
fastened to the illustration; or rather the illustrations
are fastened to the doctrines; and all are nails driven in
a sureplace. They are argued and decided, and laid
away in the mind as appeal cases.
Whern the preacher takes a doctrine in hand, let him
call it by its right name; and never be afraid to use God's
own word to give it expression. Does he wish to express
the awful condition of men before God?  Paul offers
him his text: " By nature children of wrath."  Does he
wish to make known the entire depravity of the humanMEANS AND PLANS.
race?  Our Lord commands him to say, "that which is
born of the flesh is fleshl."  Does he wish to prostrate the
guilty-sinner before God and lead him to feel his inability
to renew his own heart, and awaken himn to look for
power not his own? - Let him take the declaration of
our Lord, " no man can come unto me except the Father
which hath sent me draw him."  Let him go all the
height, and length and breadth and depth of the word of
God openly, strongly, whether they will hear or forbear,
yet humbly and meekly, not inva(ling the province of the
divine spirit, and vainly endeavoring to smooth off the
angles of truth and to lay it quietly into men's minds
and let it transform them, they know not how nor why.
The Divine Spirit will take care of 7his own truth, plainly
and believingly delivered: it is designed for saints and
sinners, it suits their state; they know it, they feel it;
and he will according to his good pleasure, make it a fire
and a hammer to break the flinty rock in pieces.
From  the foregoing observations it will be gathered,
that the preacher to the Negroes, ought to deal much in
parables, historical events; biographies; and in expository preaching. And his expository preaching may and
ought to assume some system.
Should he select parables, he may take up our Lord's
parables in order; should he select biographies, he may
go through the life of our Lord, one event succeeding
another, to the last sad catastrophe. Or, the lives of the
Apostles as far as known - notices of persons whose
history is introduced in the New Testament. Does he
desire to enter upon expository preaching? He may
take up tha Gospels and expound them in order; the
Acts of the Apostles; and various chapters in the Episties. Then there is the whole Old Testament, with the
259260    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
creation, fall, flood; the lives of the Patriarchs; the
entire history of the church of God, filled with extraordinary characters and events. A studious man and one
alive to his work, can never be without matter, as well
new as old, for the instruction of the people.  The bible,
the bible, is the great store house of truth - an ocean
without a bottom or a shore.
The practice of expository preaching recommended,
is one eminently calculated to advance the people in
knowled_re, and of different kinds of preaching is the
most improving to the minister.  He will acquire an
intimate and extensive acquaintance with the Scriptures;
discover the dependence of every part and the union
of the whole. He will have light falling directly and
indirectly upon doctrines, and they will become clear to
his mind, and he cannot tell his various steps to the
pleasant conclusion. He will gather up a vast variety of
subjects, and illustrations cf doctrines and duties; and
finally know that " all Scripture is given by inspiration
of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the
man of God may be thoroughly furnished unto all good
works." -2 Tim. 3: 16-17.
But it may be said by some that it is laborious and
difficult preaching; and that but a few have a talent for
it. He who would succeed well must labor; and it is
worth all the labor expended for it. He must expect to
encounter difficulties, but they are not insurmountable;
and the reason why it is discovered that but few. have a
talent for it, is because there are but few who perseveringlypractice expository preaching.
There are many works which will aid a minister as
acquiring the tact and the mode - such, for example, inMEANS AND PLANS.
Henry's Commentary, Andrew Fuller's Lectures on
Genesis, Porteus' Lectures on Matthew, Scott's Commentarv, Stuart on Hebrews, Hodge on Romans, Hall's
Contemplations on the Old and New Testarnent. The
list might be extended, but students do not require it,
and to those who are not students it would be of no
avail. I mention these fe;w because th:y are standard
works and of easy access, an(d are sufficient as a
specim en.
Every imitator is a slave and a bungler. N minister
should be familiar with the- works of eminent men of
God who have preceded him, and take into his mind
their great and good thoughts, that it may be expanded
and sanctified thereby. lie ought to study with care
the sermons of those who have been most successful in
winning souls to Christ, searching into the manner of
their co?nstruction, and especially into the principles
involved in their application.
But after all he must discipline himself and do his
own thinking and make his own s?rmons, and learn to
teach and to preach for himself. He muist proceed
always upon the principle of improvement. What he
may not do well to day perseverance may enable him to
do better to-morrow. Then let him know no discouragement.  "The thing can be done; by divine aid I will
do it."'
The character of the Negroes both private aid public
in a state of freedom and in a state of slavery; their
habits of thought, superstitions and mannlers, should be
carefully studied by the preacher, so that he may adapt
his preaching to them. He will perhaps frequently find
it necessary fo folli)w the advice of Paul to T'itus as to
the manner in which he should reprove the Creti Is, and
for the same reasons.  Titus 1: 1', 13. But let him
261262    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
avoid the most distant approximations to coarseness,
and follow the rule laid down in Eph. 5: 11, 12.
The strictest order should be preserved at all the
religious meetings of the Negroes, especially those held
on the Sabbath day, and punctuality observed in com.
mencing them  at the appointed hlour.  No audible
expressions of feeling in the way of groanings, cries, or
noises of any kind, should be allowed. To encourage
such things among ignorant people, suchl as they are,
would be to jeopard the interests of true religion, and
open the door to downright fanaticism. They are bad
at best, among any people-- they go from worse to
worst as we descend in ihe scale of intelligence.
Close attention should be paid to their deportment,
lest they choose the seasons of public worship for
seasons of business and pleasure; and what is more, for
settling up their disputes in regular combats. Disturbers
of the public peace should be noted down; tile cases
investigated and summary punishment inflicted by the
proper authorities on the guilty. It is the minister's
duty in all such cases to make a report and see justice
done.  The pious and more orderly and intelligent
Negroes will always discountenance and oppose such
unruly conduct. On dismissing his Sabbath congregations he should always remain, until he sees them pretty
well on their way homeward.
2. Manner of conducting Sabbath Schools.
Notice of the formation of the Sabbath school for
colored children and -outh should be carefully an(d
geneially given, together with the time and place of
meeting, and the manner in which, and the persons by
whom, the school is to be conducted.M1EANS AND PLANS.
The notice may be given by the pastor of the church
in which it is to be formed, who can take occasion to
commend the effort to the patron-age and prayers of his
people; or by the missionary; or by elders, deacons,
and private Christians who engage in the work, in the
most advantageous manner that tleir circumstances may
admit of.
The notice should be directed first of all, to owners
and managers and their support entreated: next, to the
parents of the children, and the Sabbath school commended as affording that religious instruction to their
children which in a majority of instances they cannot
furnish themselves, and which will contribute to the
peace and order of their families and to the respectability and happiness of their children; and last of all,
to the children and youth themselves. It will answer a
good purpose to go into some detail with them, as to the
manner in which the school will be conducted, and what
will be taught, and for what end, and how much good
the school will do them for time and eternity, the advantages yielded them by it-being suitably improved.
When the school is collected and opened, if teachers
can be procured, interested in the work and disposed to
be useful, then divide the school into classes, as in any
other school, as nearly according to age and sex, as
may be possible. Each teacher will then instruct his
own class, and at the close of the school, let the superintendant take the book and question the school, class
by class, and all together, applying the lesson with
suitable remarks and giving the scholars praise for their
punctuality, good order, and improvenlent.
Should it be impossible to obtain teachers, let the
school be seated according to size and sex, the youngest

Mr. Yarnod, missionary; had baptised 8 Negro children
belonging to AMr. Skeene and MIrs. Haige, and fhe writes
to the. society that " at once he had 19 Negro communicants."'
Mr. Neuman was sent as a missionary to North Carolina in 1722. He reported some time after " that he had
baptised 269 children, I woman, and 3 rmen, and 2
Negroes, who could say the creed, the Lord's prayer,
and ten commandments, and had good sureties for their
further information."
The Rev. Mr. Beekett, missionary in Pennsylvania,
in 1723, reported that he had baptised "two Negro
slaves."
In 1709 Mr. -Huddlestone was appointed school master
in New York City. He taught 40 poor children out of
the societies funds, and publicly catechised in the steeple
of Trinity Church every Sunday in the afternoon, "not
only his own scholars, but also the children, servants,
and slaves of the inhabitants, and above 100 persons
usually attended him."
The society established, also, a catechising school
in New York city in 1704, in which city there were
computed to be about 1,500 Negro and Indian slaves.
The society hoped their example would be generally
followed in the Colonics. Mr. Elias Neau, a French
protestant was appointed catechist; who was very zeallous in his duty and many Negroes were instructed and
baptised. In 1712 the Negroes in New York conspired
to destroy all the English, which greatly discouraged
the work of their instruction. The conspiracy was
defeated, and many negroes taken and executed, Mr.
Neau's school was blamed as the main occasion of the
barbarous plot; two of Mr. Neau's school were charged
with the plot; one was cleared and the other was proved264     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
nearest to the teacher, and then let the teacher whoever
he may be, teach the vwhole together, on the infant
school plan. I have known a minister including in a
school of this character, his entire colored congiegation
-children and adult. His spacious church every Sabbath afternoon would be crowded with the young and
old, manifesting the deepest interest and making commendable progress; and in his pastoral visitations,
hailed by the people one very plantation as their friend
and benefactor.
I would say something on manuals and plans of
instruction.
In the first part of this work several manuals of
instruction for colored persons were mentioned. They
may be mentioned again in this place with advantage.
There is the "Short Catechism, for the use of colored
members on trial of the YMethodist Episcopal Church,
in South Carolina," prepared by Dr. Capers, arid used
by the missionaries of that church in South Carolina
and Georgia. There is " the Catechism to be used by
the teachers in the religious instruction of persons of
color," etc., " prepared in conformity to a resolution of
the Episcopal Convention of the diocese of South Car.
olina, under the direction of the bishop;" used by the
Episcopaleans in South Carolina and Georgia. Thllere
is Dr. Palmer's Catechism; Rev. John Mine's; and
there is the " Catechism  of Scripture Doctrine and
Practice, designed for the oral instruction of colored
persons;" prepared by myself.
Some persons use "Scripture Cards," illustrating by
a picture some evernt in our Saviour's life; the passages
of Scripture together with questions and answers, are
printed on the cards. Entire portions are taught emMEA'NS AND -PLANS.2
bracing' parables and miracles, extracts from the book of
Common:Prayer are also used. Others takethle  Scliptures and select the more interesting events and- histories
- beginning withl the creation, and( continuing through
the New Testament. They first read the passage and
briefly exl,lain: it, an(d then take it, verse by verse, and
asl; questions, and repeat, until it is well committed&amp; to
mermory.
The " Union Questions." prepared by the Sund(ay
School Union, may be used by the teacher as a guide
to his subjects, as well as questions. lie must of course
select the questions that are most suitable to his.schlolarp.
"' Brown'. Cateclhism," and " Watts' first and second
Catechism," are also used. I have never heard of but
one instance of the "Assembly's Catechism," in connection with " Wi-llison's," being used in, the oral
instrtuction of the Negroes; that itistance was rel,orted:
to have been completely successful. I have no. doul)t
but that the teacher might take Willison's and Fiskher's
cateclhisms andt make a goo(d use of them in the oral
instruction of the Negroes. As much, it may with
truth be said, depends upon thle tcacher as upon the
man u1al of instruction use(d by him..To give varietv an(l interest to the exercises of the
Sabbath school, it is proper to teach the s(-ho,lars
hymns and psalm.s, and how to sint, them. They cre
extravagantly fond of music; and th-is taste ma.y be
turned to goodl account in their instruction.  WI[atts will
furnish a great number of suitable psalms and hymns,
aild they ma bhe selecte( from various other authors.
Some of the infant school and Sunlday school hymns,
written expressly for children, will answer well. As
specimens of the kind of sacred poetry which the Negro.23
265266    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
children and youth rea(lily learn, I would mention from
Watts, "Lord in the morning thou shalt hear," "Behold
the morning sun," "There is a God who reigns above,"
"When I can read my title clear," "Jesus with all thy
saints above," "I'm not ashamed to own my Lord," "Salvation, 0 the joyful sound," "Now in the heat of youthful blood;" and from others, "Jesus thou heavenly
stranger," "Blow ye the trumpet, blow," "There is a
fountain filled with blood," "Come humble sinner in
whose breast," "To whom    my Saviour, shall I go,"
"Glory to thee my God this night."
lT he tunes should not be intricate but plain and
awakening. One great advantage in teaching them good
psalms and hymns, is that they are thereby induced to
lay aside the extravagant and nonsensical chants, and
catches and hallelujah songs of their own composing;
and when they sing, which is very often while about
their business or of an evening in their lhouses, they will
have something profitable to sing.
In giving oral instruction two plans may be pursued.
First, the teacher asking the question, and stating the
answer and then requiring the whole school, or his whole
class, to answer together. Second, the teachler requring
the scholars in his class, or school to answer the questions, one by one, one after another, until it is apparent
the whole know it. Let both plans be united.
The teaclier must be regular and punctual in attending
the school; expect and bear with irregular attendance
on the part of his scholars, as they cannot always command their own time, and are subjected to a variety of
interruptions; use Ihis best efforts to win their esteem and
confidence, and to interest them in their lessons and
hymns; deal, largely in encouragement, and let hIis manner be lively and spirited without irreverence, soberMEANS AND PLANS.
without austerity, and his language plain and intelligible
without being foolish an(l inaccurate. To relieve the
scholars, he should vary their posture, sometimes let it
be that of sitting and sometimes that of standing. The
school shoulld always be dismissed in an orderly manner
class by class, and the chil(lren and youth, warned
against noise an(l play on the holy Sabbath.
The success of Sabbath schools, under God, depends
upon the zeal and fidelity of those who have the management of them. If superintendents and teachers are
not of the, right character, with the best materials at
command, the schools will go down.
3. Manner of conducting Plantation. Meetings.
No plantation meeting should be held except with the
knowledge and consent of the manager or owner,
The owner should have timely notice of the meeting, so
that he n ay make whatever arrangements may be necessary for it. The pastor or missionary will find it proper to send a little note, at times, to this effect:
"DEAR Sit: - If it is agreeable and convenien't, I
will preach for your people on Wednesday evening next.
Respectfully and truly,
Your friend,
C. C. J."
The invariable reply will be like the following:
"DEAR SIR:--It will be both agreeable and convenient for you to preach for us on Wednesday evening
next. It will afford me pleasure to see you.
Very respectfully yours,
W. L."
267:26     RELIGIQUS: INSTRUCTION OF TIlE NEGROES.'The owner:thus takes the meeting under his care;and
is responsible for the congregation andl the order,of it;
and he n.ay or may not, as he pleases confine the meeting to the people onr his plantation. it is, however, best
and every way most desirable to have no people present
but those belonging to the plantation upon which the
mecti,ag is held. A collection of N e,groes from several
plantittions around on one central to the whole, at night,
to attend religious meetings ought not to be allowed.
The evil in the long ruri will more thaii counterbalance
J the. good.
The attendance of the planter and his family should
be solicited, a.s it seives to encourage both the missionary andl the people, and dloes themselves good als o. In
the majority of instances they nee(I no solicitation, they
cheerfTlly go of their own accor(l.
fThe people being assembled the exercises are precisely tlhose of an evening sermon or lecture. They
are opened with sinigiiig andl prayer, reading the Scriptures, singing a secondi titme, an(l then a seimon or expository lecture, plain, pointed, short; and the whole
closed wiLh prayer and singing.
With preachingr to the allilts the pastor or missionary
may connect a catcchetical exercise wvitl the children,
and also a meeting,for the cnquirers, should any be on
the, place; and these two services may be attended to
either before or after Ihe lectu e for the people.
Now anl then a planter will object to preaching, on
his own plaitation, from prejudice against sthe miniser
or'missionary; or against such kirnl of meeting.s, because he has seen or heard of some irregularities- connecte(l with them; or from a hat-red to the Gospel itself
-not wishing its light to shine where lie may moreMEANS AND PLANS.
directly feel its influence. And while he thus excludes
the Gospel from his plantation and forbids the people to
assemble for religious worship, he will allow thern from
time to time to assemble and have dances and midnight
revels! All is peace and safely while Satan reigns:
God only is the author of all evil! There are now, as
there were in the Apostle's days, " unreasonable and
wicked men," and like him, we should pray to be delivered from them.
4. Manner of treating opposition to the good work.
As every wvork of b;enevolence has to encounter some
degree of opposition, so has that of the religious instruction of the Negroes. It is impossible in all cases to
discern the cause whence the opposition proceeds. The
causes are as various as are the interests, passions, and
prejudices of depraved men, and as hidden as are the
thoughts of the heart.
Thele being opposition it is to be met according to
its nature and wveight, and much must be left to the
christian judgment and prudence of the minister of God.
Our Lord has promised to assist his ministers in a special
manner when exposed to opposition from men. The
following general rules I would suggest for consideration.
Let opposition be met silently.
As long as access is had to the field of labor, and
there are good friends, notice nothing said or (l done -
especially if said or done behind one's back. Go, on as
though there were no opposition.
Let it be met forbearinly.
Be rather driven to extremities than led to them. Forbearance gives one's own mind time to settle down and
act discreetly,. while it gives time to the understanding

5. The manner of speakivn anvd actin. in -relation to
the Civil Coundition -of the N.Vegroes.
As ministers or missionaries -to -the Negroes, in'the

servants, for tim-e anil ieternity.  It is too mnuceh the
fashion ~of late yerirs, ffor ministers (I speak not of all,)

much of the same import. Thus societies and parties
have already decided what is right and wrong, and what
it is the duty of ministers to (lo and not to do, and so
their right of private judgment an(l of independent
action is taken quite away, and they become mere footballs to be strnck in any direction at the will of those
whlo have the privilege of playing upon them. The
people have a great horror of being priest-ridden; I
think the priests ought to have an equal horror of being
people-ridden.
It is much easier for men to become public lecturers,
or newspaper editors, an(d society agents, an(d pulpit
declaimers against the sins of their neighbors, and
against great evils, as they call them, in society, and be
overwhelmed at their own responsibility for their existence, than to traverse obscure lanes and( enter wretched
and abandoned houses, or expose themselves to midnight
airs and summer suns in unhealthy climates, to relieve
the veiy people for whom they have so gireat a love, and
for whom  they feel so deep a sympathy, of some of
their temporal sufferings, and to convey to them in their
ignorance and spiritual ruin the glad tidi-ngs of salvation.
To their own master they stand or fall.
On the civil condition of the Negroes, I here take
occasion to say, that the Southern people are a far more
reflecting and discerning people than is imagined by
some. They are great lovers of their country an(l of
the Union. No people undlerstand their political rights
better or have a more sacre(l regarid to the happy constitution under which we live; and no people are more
independlent, decided and fearless in maintaining both
the one and the other. The de-gree of genera-l intelligence among the middling and higher classes of societyMEANS AND PLANS.
is not surpassedby the same- classes of society in any
part of the Union; al.(d they are disposed to live on
terms of perfect amrnity with their fellow citizens from
every section of our great couintry. They expect to
find the citizen. of the free States, at home and when
they come South, entertaining views lifferent from their
owtn. They would not take away the right of private
ju(lgment and opitnion. They accord to others what
they (lemand for themselves.  But having lhad the institution of slavery entailed upon them, and its existence
recogrize.d, and its perfect control an:l management
sectired to tlhem  under the Constitution, they claim
exemption froin the (lictation an(l interference of people
no way responsible for, nor affected by, the institution;
an(i tile right to regulate it in suclh a manner as in their
best jud(grnent shall promote the best good( of all concerne(l therein - the very right whlich has already been
exercised by eight of the original " thirteen States,"
writhout any interference at all on the part of the remaining States. Iencce, occupying this ground, they
make no objection to merchlants, lawyers, physicians,
divines, teachers or -mecllanics, coming and( settling
among them from  any part of tlle world.  They are
entitled t:) their own opinions, but they are neither to
be expressed nor propagated so as to produce disturbance in society.
6. The best form of Church Organization for the
Negroes.
In the free States it is ju(lged most advisable both by
whites and blacks, that the latter should have their own
houses of puillic worship and church organizations
independent of the fornier.

to have been in the conspiracy, but guiltless of his
master's mu;der.  "Upon full trial the guilty Negroes
were fo)und to be suchI as never came to Mr. Neau's
schlool; and what is very observable, the persons whose
Negroes were found most guilty were such as were the
declared opposers of making them Christians."  In a
short time tlhe cry against the instruction of the Negroes
subsi(led: thile Governor visited and rlecommenri(ed the
school. Mr. Neau diedi in 1722, much regretted by all
who knew his labors. I- e was succeeded bly Rev. Mr.
Wetmore, who afterwar(ds was appointed missionary to
Rye in N'ew York'. After his removal 1"th? rector, church

1,400 Negro an(l In(lian slaves, a c.'osi(lerable numrber
of them ha(d been instructed ill the principles of Christianity by thle lat. Mr. Neau, and had receiveti baptism
and were conimunicants in their church. Thie society
complied with this request and sernt over Rev. Mr.
Colgan in 1726, vwho c,indtucted the school with success."
AMr. Honeymnan, missionary in 1724, in Providence,
Rhod(e Island, had bdaptized, in two year-s, SO persons,
of which 19 were grown, 3 Negroes, and 2 Indiatis, and
2 Mulattoes.
In Narcgansctt, the congregation was reported to be
160, (1720) with 12 Indian and black servants.
At Marblehead, the missionary reported( (1725) having
baptized 2 Negroes; 1"a man abotut 25 years old and a
girl 12, an(l that a whole family in Salem had conformed
to the chtrch."
The society looked upon the instruction and conversion of the Negroes as a principal branch of tlheir care;
esteeming it a great reproach to the Christian name,
2
13274    RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIIE NEGROES.
But in the slave States it is not advisable to separate
the blacks from the whites. It is best that both classes
worsHip in the same building; that they be incorporated
in the same church, under the same pastor, having access to the same ordinances, baptism  and the Lord's
supper, and at the same tirnc; an(l that they be subject
to the same care and discipline; the two classes forming
one pastoral charge, olne church, one congregation.
Should circumstances beyond control require the
Negroes to meet in a separate builtling and have separate preaching, yet they shouldl be considered part and
parcel of the white church. Members should be admitted and excommunicated,andl ordinances administered
in the presence of the united congregations.
This mingling of the two classes in churches creates
a greater bond of union between them, an(d kin(ler feelings; tentls to increase subordination; and promotes in
a higher degree the improvement of the Negroes, in
piety and morality. The reverse is, in the general, true
of independent churchl organizations of the Negroes,
in the slave States.
The appoinrtment of colored preachers and watchmen
(the latter acting as a kind of elders,) by the white
churches, and under their particular supervision, in
many districts of country has been attended with happy
effects, and such auxiliaries propeily managed may be
of great advantage.
Such are the means and plans for promoting and securing the religious instruction of the Negroes, in the
United States, and of those in the Southern States in
particular, which experience and observat on have suggested to my own mind. Anti having brought this part
of the subject to a close, I have reached, in the good
providence of God, the end of my undertaking.MEANS AND PLANS.
CONCLUSION.
After saying so much on the Religious Instruction of
the Negroes, I feel that the conclusion need not be extended.
I would respectfuilly and earnestly commend the subject to the serious consideration of Masters.
You are commande(d of God " to give unto your servants thiat which is just and equal; knrowing that ye also
have a master in heaven - neither is there respect of
persons with him." The religious instruction of your
people will promote your own interests for time and
eternity, and will confer on theni blessings infinitely
valuable, even the redemption of the soul, which is
precious. Your responsibilities in the word and providerice of God are very great. If you neglect them, a
fearful account awaits you at tile judgement seat of
Christ! Contribute, therefore, according to your ability,
of your property, your influence and personal efforts,
to this good work; an(I do it speedily.
I would commend the work also to Ministers of the
Gospel.
Our Divine Lord, " though he was rich, yet for our
sakes he became poor, that we, through his poverty,
might be made rich."  He was annointed of God "to
preach the Gospel to the poor," an(l through him, while
on earth, 1" the poor have the Gospel preached to them."
In this he has left us an example that we shouldl follow
his steps; for" the disciple must not be above his Lord,"
Like the Apostles of old, we should "be forward to
remember the poor." It is disgrace and iniquity when
we forget them! God is judge! On the ministers of
the Gospel the religious instruction of the Negroes in
275276     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEIGROES.
the IUnitetl States depends, more than upon all the other
classes an(d professions of society put together. It is
their work. They are to prolmote it -by co,nversation,
by preaching, an(d above all, by example, in personal
labors. They have it in their power, by their piety and
zeal and efforts, to advance an(l sustain this work,: or by
their impiety and lethargy, anlt absolute inactivity, to
retard andt break it down, throughbut the length and
breadth of the land. There lhas been teglect--shdll it
be said, a criminal neglect? I feel it. Others feel it.
The whole country sees it. Can there be no refol mation?
Shall the ministers of Jesus Christ never be moved
with compassion on the nmultitudes who faint an(d are
scatteredl abroad as sheep I;avinlg no shepherd?  Shall
their hearts' (lesire an(i prayer to God never be that this
people may be saved?  Shall they never be attracted
an(l drawn towards this people by their very spiritual
destitution and miseries, and spend and be spent for them,
constrained by the love of Christ, towalrds their own
souls?  Alas! it is the (larkest feature in all this (lark
scene that the ministers of the Gospel, taken as a body,
feel no more and ldo no more for the salvation of the
Negroes in the Unit:d States!  Let no one suppose
that we wishl the church thrown into a state of excitement on the subject; an(l the good that has been (lone,
and now is (loing, and the many able an(d efficient niinis
ters in this fiel(l to be overlooked and buirie(l in oblivion.
Let no one suppose that we wish this work to be represerite(l and urged before the country, as the great work
to be done, to which all other works of benevolence are
to contribute, antd in comparison witli whichl they are
notlhiig worth. Let no one sutppose that we (lesire
ministers to form great societies and distribute agentsMEANS AND PLANS#2
over the land, to arouse their brethren to their duty.
Far, very far from any thing of this kind are our views
of propriety and our impressions of duty. On the
contrary, there are organizations and associations enough
in existence through which every thing can be done,
necessary to be done by them in the religious imstruction
of the Negroes. What is required is that every minister
do his own duty in his own sphere of ministerial action;
let him begin with himselffirst, and then if opportunity
offers, let him seek to~ influence others, in some of the
ways already pointed out.
I would commend the work also to the Mlkembers of
the Church of Christ.
You are expected to be forward to every good word
and work. liere is an abundant opportunity for doing
good opened before you. Enter into it for the improvement of your own graces, as well as for the salvation of'
souls. All your zeal for missions may find ample scope
for exercise here. Be forward to superintendl schools,
to take classes, to' act on committees of instruction, and
be not weary in well doing, for in due season you shall
reap if you faint not.
I would commend the work also to every Lover of his
Country.
The moral and religious improvement of two millions
eight hundred thousand persons, must be identified with
our individual peace and happiness, and with our national
prosperity and honor. " Righteousness exalteth a nation,
but sin is a reproach to any people."

that so many thousands of peisons should continue in
the same state of Pagan darkness- under a Christian
government and living in Christian families, as they lay
before under in their own heathen countries.  The
society immediately from their first institution strove to
promote their conversion, and in as much as their income
would not enable them to send numbers of catechists
sufficient to instruct the Negroes; yet they resolved to
do their utmost, and at least to give this work the mark
of their highest approbation. They wrote, therefore, to
all their missionaries, that they should use their best
endeavors, at proper times, to instruct the Negroes, and
should especially take occasion to recomnmend it zealously
to the masters to order their slaves at convenient times,
to come to them that they might be instrzucted. These
directions had a good effect, antl some hund(reds of
Negroes had been instructed, received baptism, and been
admitted to the communion, and lived very orderly
lives."
The History of the Society goes on to say: "It is a
matter of commendation to the clergy that they have
done thus much in so great and difficult a work. But,
alas! what is the instruction of a few hundlreds in several
years, with respect to the many thonsands uninstructed,
unconverted; living, dying, utter pagans! It must be
confessed, what hath been done is as nothing with regard
to what a true Christian would hope to see effected."
After stating several dlifficulties in respect to the religious
instruction of the Negr'oes, (which do not exist at the
present time, but in a very limited degree,) it is said:
"' But the greatest obstruction is, the masters themselves
do not consider enough the obligation which lies upon
them to have their slaves instructed."  And in anotherHISTORICAL SKETCH.
place, " the society have always been sensible the most
effectual way to convert the Negroes was by engaging
their masters to countenance and promote their conversion." The Bishop of St. Asaph,Dr. Fleetwood, preached
a sermon before the society in the year 1711, setting
forth the duty of instructing the Negroes in the Christian
religion. The society thought this so useful a discourse
that they printed and dispersed abroad in the Plantations
great numbers of that sermon, in the same year; and in
the year 1725, reprinted the same and dispersed again
large numbers. The Bisllop of London, Dr. Gibson, (to
whom the care of the Plantations abroad, as to religious
affairs, was committed,) became a second advocate for
the conversion of the Negroes, and wrote two letters on
this subject. The first in 1727, " addressed to masters
and mistresses of families, in the English Plantations
abroad, exhorting them to encourage and promote the
instruction of their Negroes in the Christian faith. The
second, in the same year, addressed to the missionaries
there; directing them to distribute the said letter, and
exhorting them to give their assistance towards the
instruction of the Negroes within their several parishes."
The society were persua(led this was the true method
to remove the great obstruction to their conversion, and
hoping so particular an application to the masters and
mistresses fronm the See of Lon(lon would have the
strongest influence, they printed 10,000 copies of the
letter to tnasters and mistresses, which were sent to all
the Colonies on the continent, and to all the British
Islands in the West Indies, to be distributed among the
masters of families, and all other inhabitants.  The
society received accounts that these letters influenced
many masters of families to have their servants

instructed. The Bishop of London soon after wrote
"an addlress to serious Christians among ou-rselves, to
assist the Society for Propagating the Gospel in carrying
on this work."
The letters of Dr. Gibson referre(d to, for theirintrinsic
excellence, arnd as an indication of the state of feeling on
the subject, at the time they were wvritten, render it
proper that they shotuld be inserted in this Sketch. I

mistaken suggestions of the clhange which baptisni would
make in the condition of the Negroes, to the loss and
disadvantage of their masters.
I. As to the Difticulties: it may be pleatled that the
Negroes are grown pcrsons wheti they come over, anti
that having been accustome(l to the pagan rites and
idolatries of their own country, they are prejudiced
against all other religions, and( more particularly against
the Christian, as forbidding all that licentiousness which
is usually practised among the heathens.
But if this were a good argutnent against attempting
the conversion of Negroes, it would follow that the
Gospel is never further to be propagated than it is at
present, and that no endeavors are to be used for the
conversion of heathens at any time, or in any country,
whatsoever: because all heatheni have been accustomed
to pagan rites and idolatries, and to such vicious and
licentious living as the Christian religion forbids. But
yet, God be thanked, heathens have been converted and
Christianity propagated in all ages, and almost all countries, through the zeal and diligence of pious and good
men; and this without the help of miracles. And if the
present age be as zealous and diligent in pursuing the
proper means of conversion, we have no reason to
doubt, but that the divine assistance is, and will be, the
same in all ages.
But a fuirther difficulty is, that they are utter strangers
to our language and we to theirs; and the gift of
tongues being now ceased, there is no means left of
instructing them in the doctrines of the Christian religion.
And this, I own, is a real difficulty, as long as it con-.
tinues, and as far as it reaches. But if I am rightly

informed, many of the Negroes who are grown persons
when they come over, do of themselves attain so much
of our language as enables them to understand and to
be understood, in things which concern the ordinary
business of life; and they who can go so far, of their
own accord, might doubtless be carried much further, if
proper methods and endeavors were used to bring them
to a complete knowledge of our language, with a pious
view to the instructing them in the doctrines of our
religion. At least some of them, who are more capable
and more serious than the rest, might be easily instructed
both in our language and religion, and then be made use
of to convey instruction to the rest in their ownlanguage.
And this, one would hope, may be done with great ease,
wherever there is a hearty and sincere zeal for the work.
But whatever difliculties there may be in instructing
those who are grown up before they are brought ovei,
there are not the like difficulties in the case of their
children, who are born and bred in our own Plantations,
who have never been accustomed to pagan rites and
superstitions, and who may easily be trained up, lilie all.

But supposing the difficulties to be much greater than
I imagine, they are not such as, render the work impos--
sible, so as to leave no hope of any degree of success;.
and nothing less than an impossibility of doing any gool(
at all, can warrant our giving over and laylng aside alt

trial, than they are afterwards found to be in experience;
especially wlhere there is not a good heart to go about
them. And it is frequently observed that small beginnings,
when pursued with resolution, are attended with great
and surprising success. But in no case is the success
more great and surprising than when good men engage
in the cause of God and religion, out of a just sense of
the inestimable value of a soul, and in full and well
grounded assurance that their honest designs and endeavors for the promoting religion, will be supported by a
special blessing from God.
I am loth to think so hardly of any Christian master,
as to suppose that he can deliberately hinder his Negroes
from being instructed in the Christian faith; or which is
the same thing, that he can, upon sober and mature
consideration of the case, finally resolve to deny them
the means and opportunities of instruction. Much ]less
may I believe that he can, after he has seriously weighed
this matter, permit them to labor on the Lord's day:
and least of all, that he can put them under a kind of
necessity of laboring on that day, to provide themselves
with the conveniences of l-ife; since our religion so
plainly teaches us that God has given one day in seven,
to be a day of rest; not only to man, but to the beasts.
That it is a day appointed by him for the improvement
of the soul, as well as the refreshment of the body; and
that it is a duty incumbent upon masters, to take care
that all persons who are under their government, keep
this day holy, and employ it to the pious and wise purposes for which God,-our'great Lord and Master--
intended it. Nor can I think so hardly of any missionary, who shall be desired by the master to direct and
assist in the instruction of his Negroes, (either on thati20      RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
day or on any other, when he shall be imore at leisure,)
as to suppose that he will not embrace such invitations
with the utmost read(liness and cheerfulness, and giv7e all
the help that is fairly consistent withl the necessary
duties of his function, as a parochial rniister.
If it be said that no time can be spare(l from the daily
labor and employment of the Negroes, to instruct them
in the Christian religion; this is in effect to say that no
consideration of propagating the Gospel of God, or
saving the souls of men, is to make the least abatement
frorn the temporal profit of the masters; an(i that God
cannot or will not make up the little thev may lose in that
way, by blessing and prospering their undertakings by
sea and land, as a jtust reward of their zeal for his glory
and the salvation of men's souls. In this case, I may
well reason as St. Paul does in a case not unlike it, that
if they make you partakers of their temporal things,
(of their strengtlh and spirits, and even of their of-spring,)
you ought to make them   partakers of your spiritual
things, though it should abate somewhat from the profit
which you might otherwise receive from their labors.
And considering the greatness of the profit that is
received from their labors, it might be hoped that all
Christian masters, those especially who are possessed of
considerable numbers, shoulld also be at some small
expense in providing for the instruction of these poor
creatures, anti that others, whose numbers are less, and
who dwell in the same neighborhood, should join in the
expense of a common teacher for the Negroes belonging
to them. The Society for Propagating the Gospel in
Foreign Parts, are sufliciently sensible of the great
importance and necessity of such an established and
regiular provision for the instruction of the Negroes, and.HISTORICAL SKETCH.                 21
earnestly wish an(d pray, that it may please God to put
it into the hearts of good Christians, to enable them to
assist in the work, by seasonable coritributions for that
end: but at present their fiund does scarce enable them
to answer the many d(emands of mlissionaries, fo(:r the
performance of divir!e service in thie poorer settlements,
which are not in a condition to maintain tlhem  at their
own charge.
II. But it is fuirther pleaded, tl]at the itistruction of
heatlhens in the Christian f:ith, is in order to their haptism: anlI that not onlr the time to be allowed for
instructing them, would be an abatement firom the profits
of their labour, bht also, Ihat the baptizirg thlem when
instructedl would destroy bothi the property wliichl the
mastets lhave in themr as slaves bouight with their nlorley
andl the right of selling them again at pleasure. and that
the making them    Christiarns, onily malkes them  less
diligent and( more ulngoverna ble.
To whllich it may be very truly replied, that Christianity and the embracing of the Gospel (loes not make
the least alteration in civil property, or in any of the
duties which beloing to civil relati{ons; but in all these
respects, it continues persons j.ust in the same state as it
found them. The freedorn wvhich Christianity ives is a
free(lom from the bondage of sin and satan, and fiom
the donminion oftmen's lusts and passions and itlordinate
desires; bit as to their oultward conldition, whatever
that was before, whether bond or fiee, their being b!aptized and( becoming Christians, makes no maniner of
change in it.  As St. Palll ihas expressly toldl us, I Cor.
7: 20, where he is speaking (lirectly to this point, "Let
every man abide in the same calling wherein he was
called:" and at the 24th verse, "Let every man where.22      RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
in he is called therein al)ide with God."' And so far is
Christianity from discharging men from the duties of
the station or condition in which it found them, that it
lays them under stronger obligations to perform those
duties with the greatest diligence and fidelity, not only
from the fear of man but from a sense of (lduty to God,
and the belief and expectation of a fliture account. So
that to say that Christianity tends to make men less observant of their duty in any respect, is a reproach that it
is very far from deserving: and a reproach that is confuted by thle whole tenor of the Gospel precepts, which
inculcate upon all, and particularly upon servants (many
of whom were then in the con(lition of slaves,) a faithful and d(iligent d(ischarge of the dulties belonging tc; tch teeir
several stations out of conscience towards Gocd. Andl it
is also confuted by our own reason, which tells: ti how
mnuchl more forcible and constant the restraint (Of con
science is, than the restraint of fear; an(l last of all, it
is confute(l by experience, which teaches us the great
value of those servants who are truly religious, compared with those who have no sernse of religion.
As to their being more ungovernable after baptism
than before, it is certain that the Gospel every where
enjoins not only (liligence and fidelity, but also obedience for conscience sake: and does not deprive masters
of any proper metho(ds of enforcing obedience, where
they appear to be necessary.   Humanity forbids all
cruel and barbarous treatment of our fellow-creatures,
and will not suffer us to consider a being that is
erldowed with reason on a level wvitlh br,ttes: and Christianity takes not out of the hands of superiors any degrees of strictness and severity that fairly appear to be
necessary for the preserving subjection and governlment.The general law both of humanity and of Christianity,
is kindness, gentleness and compassion towards all mankind, of what nation or condition soever they be; and
therefore we are to make the exercise of those amiable
virtues our choice and desire, and to have recourse to
severe and vigorotis methods unwillingly and only out
of necessity.  Andi of this necessity, you yourselves
remain the judges, as much cafter they receive baptism as
before; so that you can be in no danger of suffering by
the change; and as to them, the greatest hardships that
the most severe master can inflict upon them is not to
be compared to the cruelty of keeping them in the state
of heathenism and depriving them of the rmeans of salvation as reached forth to all mankind in the Gospel of
Christ. And in truth one great reason why seveiity is
at all necessary to maintain government, is thle want of
religion in those who are to be governed, and who therefore are not to be kept to their duty by any thing but
fear and terror; than which there cannot be a more
uneasy state, either to those who govern or those who
are governed.
III. That these things may make the greater impression upon you, let me beseech you to consider yourselves not only as masters, but as Christitan masters,
who stand obliged by your profession to do all that
your station and coiidition etnable you to do, towards
breaking the power of satan and enlarging the kingdom
of Christ, and as having a great opportunity put into
your hands of helping on this work, by the influence
which God lhas given you over such a number of lheathen idolaters, who still continue under the dominion of
satan. In the next place let me beseech you to consider
them not barely as slaves, and upon the same level with

May 19, P727.'The Bishop of London's Letter to the Missionlaries
in the Englzsh Plantations: exhorting thein to give
their assistance towards thle Instruction of the
Negroes of their several Parishes in the Christian
Faith.
GOOD BROTHER:
Having understood by many letters from the Plantations, and by the accounts of persons who have come
from thence, that very little progress hath hitherto been
made in the conversion of the Negroes to the Christian
faith; 1 halve thought it proper for me to lay before the
masters and mistresses the obligations they are under to
promote and encoiurage that pious and necessary work,
This 1 have (done in a letter directe(d to them, of which
you will receive several copies in order to be distributed
to those who have Negroes in your parish; and I must
entreat you, wvhen you put the letter into their hands, to
enforce the design of it by any arguments that you

shall tlhinl proper to be used; and also, to assure them
of your own assistance in carrying on the work.
I arn aware that in the Plantations where the Farishes
are of so large extent, the care and labor of the parochial
ministers must be great; but yet I persuade myself that
many vacant hours may be spared from the other pastoVal duties, to be bestowed on dthis; an(l I cannot doubt
of the rea(liness of every missionary, in his own parish,
to pro.mote arid further a work so charitable to the souls
of men, and so agreeable to the great end and design of
his missiln.
As to those ministers who have Negroes of their own,
I cannot but esteem it their indispensable duty to use
their best endeavors to instruct them in the Christian
religion in order to their beinig baptized; both because
such Negroes are their proper and imnmedliate care, and
because it is in vain to hope that other masters and mistresses will exert themselves in this vwork, if they see it
wholly neglected or) but coldly pursuecd in the families
of the clergy; so that any degree of neglect on your
part, in the instruction of yotr own Negvoes, would not
only be withhloldin g from them the inlestimable benefits of Christianity,'but woultl evi(lently tend to the
obstrtucting and defeating the wthole design in every
other family.
I wouldl also hope that the school masters in the several
parishes, part of whose business it is to instrluct youth
in the pritciples of Chiristianity, might contribute some~what towards the carrying on this worlk, by beimg ready
to bestow  upon it some of their leisure time; and
especially upon the Lord's day, when botlh they and the
Negroes are most at liberty, and the cleigy are taken
up with the public duties of their functiotn.HISTORICAL SKETCHI.
And though the assistance they give to this pious
design, shoulld not meet with any rewardl from men, yet
their cornfort may be that it is the work of God and
will assure(lly be rewarded by him; and the less they
are obliged to this on account of any reward they
receive from men, the greater will their reward be from
the hands of God. I must thlererore entreat youl to
recommend it to them in nmy name, and to dispose themn
by all proper arguments andt persuasions, to turn their
thoughts seriously to it, and to be always readly to offer
and lend their assistance at their leisure hours.
And so, not (lotubting your ready anri zealouis concurrence in pror,ioting this important work and earnestly
begging a blessing from Godl upon this and all your
other pastoral labors, I remain, your aflectionrate friend
and brother.                    EDM. LONDON."

Dein Stanhope (of Canterbury) states in his sermon,
1714, that success had attended the efforts of the society,
and speaks of "children, seivants, and slaves catechised."
Bishop Berkley was in the Colony of Rhode Island
from 1728 till late in 1730, and he also preache(i a ser.
mon before the society, February 18, 1731, in which he
thus speaks of the Negtoes: "the Negroes in the gov..
ernment of Rhode Island, are about half as manyv more
than the tindians, and both together scarce amnount to a
seventh part of the whlole Colony. The religion of
these people, as is natural to suppose, takes after that of
their masters. Some few are baptized: several frequent
the different assemblies; and far the greater part, none
at all.

An ancient antipathy to the Indians, whom, it seems,
our first planters (therein as in certain other particulars,
affecting to imitate Jews ratliher than Christians) imagine
they had a right to treat on the foot of C(anaaunites or
Amalekites, together with an irrational contempt of the
Blacks, as creatures of another species, who had no
right to he instructed or admitted to the sacraments;
have proved a main obstacle to the conversion of these
poor people. To this may be adde(l an erroneous notion
that the being baptized is inconsistent w~ith a state of
slavery. To undeceive them in this particular, *which
had too much weight, it seeme(l a proper step, if the
opinion of his Matjesty's Attorney and Solicitor General
could be procure(l. This opinion they charitably sent
over, signe(l with their own hlands: which was accordingly p,ritted in Rhode Island, and dispersed tilrough
the Plantations. I heartily wish it may pronl(ce the
intentled effect. It moust be owne(l otur reformed planters
with respect to the natives and the slaves, might learn
firom the Church of Rome how it is their interest and
duty to behave. Both French and Spaniards, take care
to instruct both them and their Negroes in the Popish
religion, to the reproach of th(se w\ho profess a better."'
From a " proposal to establish a college in Bernmuda,"
first published in 1725, the Bishop remarks: " Now the
clergy sent over to America have proved, too many of
them, very meanly qualified, both in learning and morals,,
for the discharge of their office. And indeed, little can
be expected from the example or instruction of those,
who quit their native country on no other motive than
that they are not able to procure a livelihood in its
which is known to be often the case, To this may behHISTORICAL SKETCH.
imputed the small care that hath been talien to convert
the Negroes of our Plantations, who, to the infamy of
England, and scandal of the world, continue heathen
under Christian masters, and in Christian countries;
which woul(1 never be if our planters were rightly
instructed and inade sensible that they disappointed their
own baptism by denying it to those who belong to them:
that it would be of advantage to their affairs to have
slaves wlho should "obey in all things their masters
according to the flesh, not with eye-service as men
pleasers, but in singleness of heart, as fearing God:"
that Gospel liberty consists with temporal servitude:
and that their slaves would only become better slaves
by being Christians." --[Berkley's Works: copied by
Rev. W. W. Eells.]
In 1741, Archbishop Seeker, after enumerating other
successes, adds: "in less than 40 years great multitudes
on the whole, of Negroes and Indians, brought over to
the Christian faiith."
Bishop Drummond, in 1754, notices the Negroes in
his sermon before the society, and insists upon the duty
and safety of giving them the Gospel.
The amiable Porteus, 1783, when Bishop of Chester,
(afterwards Bishop of London,) took a lively interest in
this work, and preached a sermon before the society in
support of it which may be found in his works.
In the year, 1783, and the following, soon after the
separation of our Colonies from the Mother Country,
the society's operations ceased, leaving in all the Colonies, 43 missionaries; two of whonl were in the Southern
States, one in North, and one in South Carolina. The

in 1785. Thus ternminated the connection of this, nobI'
society with our country, which, from the foregoing
notices of its efforts, must have accomplished a great
deal for the religious instruction of the Negro population.
Thus, it is perceived, that the Negroes were not forgotten by the Church of Christ in England. Were
they iemembered by the Church of Christ in the Colonies themsselves? We have no record of missions or
of missionary stations establislled by or in any of the
Colonies, in behalf, exclusively, of the Negroes, up to

1738.  The Moravian or United Brethren were the
first who forimally attem.pted the es-tablishment of Missions, exclusively to the Negro'es.
A succinct accounrt of thetir several efforts down to the
year 1790, is given in the report of the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel amIong the Heathen, at Salem
N. C., October 5th 183'7; by Rev. J. Renatus Schmidt,
and is as follows:
"A  hundred years have now    elapsed since the
Renewed Church of the Brethren first attempted to
communicate the Gospel to the many thousand Negroes
of our land. In 1737 Count Zinzendorf paid a visit to
London, and formed a-n acquaintance with Geiieral Oglethorpe and the Trustees of Georgi;, with whom he
conferred on the subject of the mission to the'Indians,
which the Brethren had alrea(ly established in that
Colony, (in 1735.) Some of these gentlemen were
associates under the will of Dr. Bray, who had left ftlndrs
to be devoted to the conversion of the Negro slaves in
South Carolina; and they solicited the Count to procure
them some missionaries for this purpose. On his objectinigHISTORICAL SKETCH.
that the Church of England might hesitate to recognize
the ord(ination of the Brethren's missionaries, they
referred the question to the Archbishop of Canterbury,.
Dr. Potter, who gave it as his opinion,' that the Brethren being members of an Episcopal Church whose doctrines contained nothing repugnant to the Thirty-nine
Articles, ought not to be denied free access to the
heathen.'  This declaration not only removed all hesitation from the min(ls of the trustees as to the present
application; but openled the way for the labors of the
Brethren amongst the slave population of the WVest
Intlies;--a great and blessed work, which has, by the
gracious help of God, gone on increasing even to the
present daty.
T'he same year Brother Peter Boehler was deputed to
commence the (lesired mission, with Brother George
Schulius as his assistant.  They set out by way of
London, in February 1738, and repaired, in the first
instance, to Georgia, hoping to be provided with means
for the prosecution of their journey by the colony of
the Birethren already established there. Obstacles however being interposed, through the interested views of
certain  ndivi(luals, this nmission failed and our Brethren, settlirng at Purisburg, took charge of the Swiss
Colonists and their' chil(lren in that town; Georgia not
being at that peri(d a slave-holding Colony. In 1739,
Schulius (leparted this life. Peter Boehler emigrated in
1740, to Pennsylvania, with the whole Georgia Colony,
of which he was minister; l,ecause they were required
to bear arms, in the war against the Spaniards, which
had recently broken out. In 1747 and 1748 some
Brethren belonging to, Bethlehem, undertook several

long and difficult journies through Maryland, Virginia,
and the borders of North Carolina, in order to preach
the Gospel to the Negroes, who, generally speaking,
received it witlh eagerness.
Various proprietors, however, avowing their determination not to suffer strangers to instruct their Negroes,
as they had their own ministers, whom they paid for
that purpose, our bretliren ceased from their efforts. It
appears from the letters of brother Spangenberg, who
spent the greater part of the year 1749 at Philadelphia,
and preached the Gospel to the Negroes in that city,
that the labours of the brethren amongst them were not
entirely fruitless. Thus he writes in 1751 -'on my
arrival in 1l'iladelphia, I saw numbers of Negroes still
buried in all their native ignorance and darkness, and
my soul was grieved for them. Soon after some of
them came to me, requesting instruction, at the same
time acknowledging their ignorance in the most afflcting rnanner. They begge( that a weekly sermon might
be delivered expressly for their benefit. I complied
with their request and confined myself to the most essential truths of scripture. Upwards of 70 Negroes attended
on these occasionvs, seve al of wliom were powerfullly
awakened appl'ed for fu th,,r instructi n anti expressed
a desire to be united to Christ aitl his Church by the
sacramnent of Baptism  which was accordingly administered to them.'
At the Provincial Synod which was held in Pennsylvania in 1747, brother Christian Frohlich was commissioned to take cliarge of the Negroes of New-York,
who had evinced a great desire for the gospel, and of
whom several had been already won for the Redeemer,,HISTORICAL SKETCH.
by means of their attendance on tile ministry of the
word. In 1751 he visited the scattered Negroes in
New-Jersey, by whom he was every where received
with joy, and preached Christ crucified to a hundred of
them at once with considerable effect, besides conversing with them at their work.
A painting is preserved at Bethlehem in which the
eighteen first-fruits from  the heathen who had been
brought to Christ by the instrumentality of the brethren,
and had departed in the f;iith. prior to the year 1747,
are represented, dresse(l in their native costume and
standing before the throne of Christ with palms in their
hands, with the inscription beneath:' q'hese are

At the request of Mr. Knox, the English Secretary of
State, an attempt was made to evangelise the Negroes
of Georgia. In 1774 the brethren, Lewis Muller, of the
Academy at N:esk-y, and (;eorge Wagn('r., were called
to North America, and in the year following, having
been joined by brother Andrew Broesing of North Caro,

THE preparation of the following pages has been undertaken
at the suggestion of friends, seconded by the convictions of
my own mind, that a small volume on the Religious Instruction
of the Negroes in the United States would not be an unacceptable
offering to the Public, and especially the Christian Public, at
the present time. Whatever I have before prepared or published
on the subject has been freely used, whenever it has suited my
purpose, in the present composition.
I have endeavored to confine myself to the Religious
Instruction of the Negroes, and have touched upon other
subjects only when it has been necessary for the illustration or
support of the one before me.
I coinmend the Book to the candid consideration of those
who read it. My design has been to speak the truth plainly
and in love, and to do good. May the blessing of Almighty
God attend the effort.

Of the condition of the Negroes about this time in
New England, it has been said, "Their lot iwas far from
being severe. They were often bought by conscientious persons, for the purpose of being wvell irnstructed
in the Christian religion.  They ha(l universally the

1747. Dlirect efforts foi the religious instruction of'
Negroes, continued through a series of years, were
made by Presbyterians in Virginia.     They cominenced with the Rev. Siamutel Davies, afterwards President of Nassau Hall, and the Rev. John Todd of lIanover Presbytery.
Mr. Davies began his ministry in Hanover in 1747
and left Virginia about 1773 or 4. Mr. Davies, four or
five years after his settlement in Ilanover,'"foiund it
impossible to afford even a montlily supply of preaching to the congregations organizedl by him. Accordingly he sought an assistant in Mr. John Todd, a
young preacilhe firom Pennsylvania, who was installed
in the upper part sof Hanover, November 12, 1752."
In a letter ad(dressed to a friend and member of the
"6 Society in London for promoting Christian knowledge
among the poor," in the year 1755, he thus expresses
himself: " The poor neglected Negroes, who are so far
from having money to pulrchase books, that they themselves are the property of others: who were originally

or his Gospel until they arrived at the land of their

neglect, and whose souls none care for, as though
immortality were not a privilege common to them, as
with their masters; these p'oor unhappy Afiicans are
objects of my compassion, arid I thirnk the most proper
objects of the Society's charity. The inhabitants of
Virginia are computed to be about 300,000 men, the
one-lhalf of which number are supposed to be Negroes.
The number of tihose who attend my ministry at particular times, is uncertain, but generally about 300, who
give a stated attendlance; and(l never have I been so
struck with the appearance of an assembly, as when I
have glance(d my eye to that part of the meeting-house
where they usually sit, adorned (for so it lhas appeared
to me) with so many black counternances, eagerly attentive to every word they hear and frequently bathed in
tears. A consi(lerable number of them (about a hundred) have been baptisedl, afler a proper time for instruction, having given credible evi(lence, not only of their
acquaintance with the important doctrines of the Christian religion, but also( a (leep sense of themr in their
minds, attested by a life of strict piety ard holiness.

every opportunity of acquainting themselves with the
doctrines of the Gospel; and though they have generally
very little help to learn to read, yet to my agreea
ble surprise, many of them, by dint of application in
their leisure hours, have made such progress that they
can intelligibly read a plain author, and especially their
bibles; and pity it is that any of them, should be without them."  Mr. Davies furnished the Negroes with
what books he could procure for them, ani requested a
supply from the society of 1libles and Watt's psalms and
lhymns. Having received a supply he distributed them
to the great joy of the Negroes. "The books were all
very acceptable, but none more so than the psalms and
hymns, which enable them to gratify their peculiar taste
for psalmody. Sundry of them have lodged all night
in my kitchen, and sometimes when I have awaked about
tivo or three o'clock in the morning, a torrent of sacred
harmony has poured into my chamber and carried,
my mind away to heaven. In this seraphic exercise
some of them spen(d almost the whole night.'I wish,
Sir, you and other benefactors could hear some of these
sacred concerts. I am persuaded it would surprise and
please you more, than an Oratorio or a St. Cecelia's day."
He observes: "The Negroes, above all the human
species that ever I knew, have an ear for music and a
kind of extatic delight in psalmody, and there are no
books they learn so soon, or take so much pleasure in as
those used in that heavenly part of divine worship."
On one sacramental occasion " he had the pleasure of
seeing 40 of them around the table of the Lord, all of
whom made a credible profession of Christianity, and
seveial of them gave unusual evidence of sincerity, and
he believed that more than 1,000 Negroes attended on

his ministry at the different places where he alternately
officiated."
Mr Davies writes Dr. Bellamy, in I757, " what little
success I have lately had, has been chiefly among thd
extremes of Gentlemen and Negroes. Indeed, God has
been remarkably worlking among the latter. I have
baptized about 150 adults; and at the last sacramental
solemnity, I had the pleasure of seeing the table graced
with about 60 black faces. They generally behave well
as far as I can hear, though there are some instances of
apostacy among them."'The counties in which Mr.
Davies labored were Hanover, Henrico, Goochland,
Caroline, and Louisa.
" The Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign
Parts," already noticed, in 1745 established a school in
Charleston, S. C., under the direction of Commissary
Garden  It flourished greatly and seemed to answer
their utmost wishes. It had at one time 60 scholars and
sent forth annually about 20 young Negroes well insWtructed in the English language and the Christian faith.
This school was established in St. Phillip's church and
snome of its scholars were living in 1822, of orderly and
~decent characters. --Bp. Meade and Dr. D)alcho.
The year 1l47 was marked in the Colony of Georgia
by the authorized introduction of slaves. Twenty three
tepresentatives from the different districts met in Savanriah, and after appointi:g Major Horton president, they
entered into'sundry resolutions -the substance of which
Was" that the owners of slaves, should educate the

1764. The Rev. Ezra Stiles, D. D., afterwards priesident of Yale College, and Dr. Samuel Hopkins, un(dertook the education of two apparently promising Negroes
with a view to the ministry; bvt it was finally a failure.
pDr. Plumer's Report.
1770. While Dr. Stiles was pastor in Newport, R.
1., there were many African slaves in that town. "Of
80 communicants in his chiurch in that town, 7 were
Negroes. These occasionally met, by his direction, for
religious improvement in liis study."
Methodism was introduced into this country in New
York, 1766 and the first missionaries were sent out by
Mr. Wesley in 1769. One of these, Mr. Pillmore, in a
letter to Mr: Wesley, from New York, in I770, says,
~' the number of blacks that attend the preaching affects
ne much."  The first regular conference was held in
Philadelphia, 1773.  Number of ministers 10 and of
members 1,160. From this year to 1776 there was a
great revival of religion in Virginia under the preaching
of the Methodists, in connection with Rev. Mr. Jarratt
of the Episcopal Church, wlich spread through 14
counties in Virgin'ia and 2 in North Carolina. One letter states, " the chapel was full of white and blackl;"
another "hundreds of Negroes were among them with
tears streaming down theii faces."  At Roanoke another Iemarks, "in general the white people were within
the chapel and the black people without."
1780. At the Sth conference in Baltimore the following question appeared in the minutes. " Ques. 25..Ought not the assistant to meet the colored people himself and appoint as helpers in his absence proper white
persons, and not suffer them to stay late and meet by
themselves? Ans. - Yes." Under thp preaching of Mr.40      RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
Garretson in Maryland, "hundreds both white and
black expressed their love of Jesus."
1786. The first return of colored members distinct
from white occurs in the minutes of this year, and then
yearly afterwards, white 18,791, colored 1,890.  "It
will be perceived from the above," says Dr. Bangs ir
his history of the Methodist Episeopal Church, " that a
consi(lerable number of colored persons had been received into the chureli, and xvere so returned in the minutes
of conference. Hence it appears that at an early period
of the Methodist ministry in this country it had turned
its attention to this part of the population."
Mr. Rankin writing on the general state of Methodism
in the Colonies at the the commencement of hostilities,
observes, "in May 1777 we had 40 preachers in the
different circuits and about 700  mrnembers inn the society,
besides many hundreds of Negroes, who were convinced
of sin, and many of them happy in the love of God."
L'ife of Coke, p. 53,
In the year 1786 the following case of conscience was
overtured from Donegal Presbytery, in the Synod of
New York and Philadelphia; namely,
"Whether Christian masters or mistresses ought in
duty to have such children baptized, as are under their
care though born of parents not in the communion of
any Christian church?"
Upon this overture " the synod are of opinion that
Christian masters and mistresses whose religious professions and conduct are such as to give them a.right to the
ordinance of baptism for their own children,, may and
ought to dedicate the childlren of their household to God,
in that ordinance, when they have no sciuple of conscience to the contrary."'-Min. p, 413, and Min. of
Gen'l Assem. p. 97.HISTORICAL SKETCH.
And on the next page (414) it was overtured s "whether Christian slaves haviing children at the entire direction
of unchristian masters, and not having it in their power
to instruct. them in religion, are bound to have them
baptized; and whlether a Gospel minister in this predicament ought to baptize them?" The synod determined
the question in tile affirmative.
1787. The minutes of the Methodist conference for
this year, furnish the following question and answer,
indicative of continued interest in the colored population.
"Ques. 17.-What directions shall we give for the
promotion of the spiritual welfare of the colored peopie? Ans. - We conjure all o,ur ministers and preachers
by the love of God and the salvation of souls, and do
require them by all the authority that is invested in us
to leave nothing undone for the spiritual benefit and
salvation of them, within their respective circuits or
districts; and for this purpose to. embrace every opportunity of inquiring into the state of their souls, and to.
unite in society those who appear to have a real desire
of fleeing from the wrath to come;.- to meet such in
class, and to exercise the whole Methodist discipline
among them."  Number of colored members 3,893.
1790. Again: " Ques.- What can be done in, order to
instruct poor children, white and black, to! ead? Ans.
Let us labor as the heart and soul of one man to estab.

piety,".  The experiment was made, but it proved
unsuccessful and was discontinued. Number of colored
members this year 11,652.
The Methodist is the only denomination which ha,s
preserved returns of the nlumber of colored members
in its connection.. I find it impossible to make any
estimate of the number in connection with the other'
denominations. The Metho(lists met with more success
during: this period in the Middle and Southern States
than in the Northern,, and as they paid particular atten,
tion to the Negroes laige numbers were brought under
their influence.
The first Baptist church in this country was founded
in Providence, R. I., by Roger Williams, in 1639.
Nearly one hundre(i years after the settlement of America, " only 17 Baptist churches had arisen in it." The
Baptist church in Charleston S. C., was fouunded itn 1690.
The denomination advanced slowly through the Middle
and Southern States and in 1790 it had churches in them
all. Revivals of religion wvelre enjoye(l, particularly
one in Virginia whiclh commenced in 1785 and continued
until 1:791 or 1792. "Thousands. were converted and
baptized, besides many who joined the Mletho(dists and
Presbyterians."  A large number ot Negroes were admitted to the Baptist churches during the seasons of
revival, as well as on ordinary occasions; they werehowever, nrt gathered into churches distinct from the
whites south of l'ennsylvania except in Georgia. Brief
notices of churches composed exclusively of Negroes
will be given in the second period of this Sketch. Be-.
fore the Revolution the Negroes in Virginia attended in
crowds the E1piscopal church, there being no other
denomination, of Christiana of con.sequence in the State,;HISTORICAL SKETCH.
but upon the introduction of other denominations they
went off to them. Old Robert Carter, or Counsellor
or King Carter, as lie was commonly called, among the
richest men in the State, owning some 700 or 800 slaves
and large tracts of land; built Christ's Church in Lancaster county, Va., and reserved one-fourth for his
servants and tenants.  He was himself baoptized, and
afterwards emancipated a large number of his Negroes
and living fourteen or fifteen years a Baptist, embraced
and died in the faith of Swedenborg.
The independence of the AImerican Colonies was
acknowledged and peace established in 17t3.  The
articles of confedeiation of 1778 were superseded by
our present Constitution in 1787, from the ratification of
which to the present time our country has been rapidly
advancing ini prosperity.
From the beginning of our controversies with the mother country to the breaking out of the revolutionary war;
throughout the period of that arduous strtiggle; and
from its close, throughout the period of national exhaustion, loss of public cre(dit, derangement in trade, political
excitements, and conflicting opinions, to the ratification
of the cons.titution, a perioid of near 20 years, the colonies suffered immeasurably in a moral and religious
point of view; and the notices d(iring this perio(d of the
state of the churches and of the progress of the Gospel,
are gloomy, and some of them of the gloomiest character. Of course the Negroes suffered in commoni with
the rest of the population.
A few remarks suggested by the facts embraced ir;
this first period of our Sketch, shall bring it to a conclusion.
The religious condition of t1he colonie&amp; up to the
4344     lRELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
period of the revolution, taken on the whole, was not
one remarkable foi its prosperity, notwithstanding
there had been some revivals of religion. The New
England Colonies were in respect to a supply of ministers and religious privileges and improvement beyond
all the rest. Btt the whole country was in a forming
state: but*recently settled; every year receiving fresh
colonists from abroad, and the older settlers pushing
their way into new and unexplored regions; while
repeated wars with the Indians, an(l wars with the
French, the Dutch, and the Spaniards, threw different
portions into protracted, distressing, and injurious commnotions. Agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and the
arts, were but in their infancy; an(t the general conduct
of the mother country in regard to the government of
the colonies and the poliey to be pursued towards them,
was wretched(; sometimes contradictory, frequently oppressive and injurious, and contrary to the wishes of the
colonists.
Such being the state of affairs, we ought not to anticipate any remarkable degree of attention, to the religious
instruction of the Negroes, within the Colonies, as an
independent class of population. Especially too, as
the effect of the slave trade, during its existence, was to
harden the feelings against the unfortunate subjects of
it, while their degraded and miserable appearance and
character, their stupidity, their uncouth languages and
gross superstitions, and their constant m,,cupation,
operated as so many checlis to benevolent efforts
for their conversion to Christianity. And thus, those
who advocated the slave-trade on the ground that it
introduced the Negroes to the blessings of civilization
and the Gospel, sawv their favorite argument losing its;
force, in great measure, from year to year..HISTORICAL SKETCH.
The fact, however, is worthy of remembrance, that
while the Indians -some of whom received us as guests
and sold us their lands at almost no compensation at all,
and others were driven back to make us room; and with
whom we had frequent and bloody wars, and we became
from time to time, mutual scourges--received some
eminent nlissionaries firom the colonists, and had no inconsiderable interest awakened for their conversion; the
African who were brought over and bought by us for
servants, and who wore out their lives as such, enriching
thousands, from Massachusetts to Georgia and were
members of our houiseholds, never received from, the
colonists themselves a solitary missionary exclusively
devoted to their good; nor was there ever a single society established within the Colonies, that we linow of,
with the express design of promoting their religious
instruction
The conclusion, however, would be unwarr-antable,
that they were iwholly neglected. The language of
President Davies, " that no manl cared for their souils,"
must be received with abatement. For they had attracted
the serious attention of societies in Ellrope, and of men
eminent for wisdom, learning, and piety; and able appeals were written to promote their religious instruction:
and some attempts were made to sen(d over missionaries
and also to engage the services of the settled clergy in
their behalf, the Church of England in this good work
taking the lead.
We are certified also, that efforts were made for their
instruction, especially in the Southern Colonies, where
their numbers were greater; and that owners (lid to some
small extent desire and attempt the instruction of their
households; and that tlhe settled as well as itinerant
4546     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
ministers did not wholly neglect them. Many Negroes
were received into the churches from one end of the
Colonies to iee oth r, and tlie rest and privileges of the
Lord's (lay were secured to them either by custom or
law. We see them occasionally noticed in the proceedings of ecclesiastical associations. There were catechetical schools and schools for teaching them to read,
in a few places. The Negroes were allowed to read,
and books were, upon occasions, distributed to them;
but the privileges of education were gradually discourage(l and withheld, more particularly in those Colonies
and States containing a large population of them, and
whose policy it was to perpetuate thle system of slavery.
Were it possible for us to obtain from all the ministers
of various denominations throughout the Colonies, who
flourished during these 170 years, a report of their i'egular pastoral labors, such as lhave been furnished by a
few, it might possibly -ppear that the Negroes received
a larger share of religious instruction than, upon a consideration of the facts now before us, many would be
led to imagine.[STORICAL SKETCH.
CHAPTER II.'THE SECOND PERIOD--From the first Census in 1790, to 1520, a
Period of 30 years.
1790. The interest awakened in Virginia, by the
labors of President Davies, continued throughout this
period, as appears by the following letter from the venerable Dr. Alexander of Princeton.
"In addition to the efforts made by the Rev. Mr.
Davies of Hanover, I would mention the name of a
faithful coadjutor in this field, the effects of whose labors
are still apparent in Cub-creek congregation, in Charlotte
county, Va. The minister to whom I allude was the
Rev. Robert Henry, a native of Scotland, who was for
many years the pastor of Cub-creek and Briery congregations ui-ited, although their distance apart was not less
than twenty miles. This gentleman possessed very
humble talents as a preacher; blundered much, and
sometimes lost himself, so that he had to conclude abruptly. He was so absent that on one occasion after
preaching, finding the horse of another person hitched
where he commonly left his own beast, he mounted and
rode him without noticing the mistake. He was notor,iously a man of prayer; for when he turned out of the
public road to go to the house where he usually lodged
4748     RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE NEGROES.
the evening before he preached at Briery, he could be
heard praying aloud long before he was in sight, and
sometimes he became so much engaged that his old bald
horse would come up and stop at the gate whilst he
was still in earnest supplication.
This man judiciously turned much of his attention to
the Negroes; and to them his ministry was attended
with abundant success.  Many were convelted and
gathered into the church at Cub-creek. As this congregation was situated on the northern bank of Staunton
river, where the land is very fertile, there were several
large estates, possessing many slaves, within reach of
the house of worship where he preached."
The Rev. Henry Lacy succeeded Mr. Henry; during
whose ministrations at Cub-creek about 200 were added
to the church. There were 60 belonging to the church
under the care of Mr. Cob.-Rev. V. S. Plum er's
Report.
Dr. Alexander proceeds: "Many yeais after Mr.
Henry's death, I was settled for several years in this
county, and preached at the same places where Mr.
Henry had labored. At Cub-creek I found about 70
black communicants, twenty-four of whom belonged to
one estate. They were, in general, as orderly and as
constant in their attendance on the word preached as the
whites. Some of them had been received in Mr. Henry's time, but others afterwards. The session of the
churcli appointed two or three leading men among them
to be a sort of overseers or superintendents of the rest,
and we found that they performed their duties faithfully.
It was in this same county and very much to the
large colored congregation at Cub-creek, that Dr. RicemISTORICAL SKETCH.
libored after I left the place. He was when first settled
pastor of Cub-creek and Bethesda, a new congregation
which grew out of the former. As he was willing to
bestow a part of his time entirely to the blacks, the
Committee on Missions of the general A.ssembly, appointed him for about three months in the year to labor
among them, arnd I know that he was much encouraged
in his work; had some very promising young converts;
and the number of communicants was not diminished
in his time.  The present pastor (1840) is the Rev.
Clement Read, a native of the county. He has labored
there and at Bethesda for many years past. Ini general
the Negroes were followers of the Baptists in Virginia,
and after a while, as they permitted many colored men
to preach, the great majority of them went to hear
preachers of their own color, which was attended with
many evils. In some parts of the state the Methodists
also paid much attention to the Negroes and received
many of them into their society; but still professors
among the Baptists were far more numerous. In many
instances those who ha(l been brought into the Presbyterian church were swept off by one or the other of
these sects. But as long as I was acquainted with the
congregation at Cub-creek, I never knew one of them
to leave their own communion for anotlher. We had
the testimony of their masters and mnistresses, to their
conscientiousness, fidelity, and diligence.  The lady
who owned 25 of the communicants, selected all her
house servants from the number, though not herself a
communicant in the Presbyterian church. And on several estates instead of overseers, some of these pious
men were appointed to superintend the labor of the
other field-servants."

The Rev. Henry Patillo, pastor "o the Grassy Creek:and Nutbush chlirches in Greenville county, North Carorlina, labored successfully:among the Negroes about
this timne; the good effects of whose efforts continued
to be felt for many years after.- Pr. Plumer's Report
to Synods of N. Carolina and Virginia.
1792. Towards the close of this year the first colored
Baptist church in the city of Savannah, began to build a:place of worship. The corporation of the city gave
them a lot for the purpose. The origin of this church
-the parent of several others--is briefly as follows:
George Leile, sometimes called George Sharp, was'born in Virginia about 1750. His master sometime
before the American war, removed and settled in Burke
county Georgia. Mr. Sharp was a Baptist an(] a deacon
in a Baptist churchl, of which Rev. MIatthew Moore was
pastor. Georae wvas converted and baptized under WMr.
Moore's ministry.  The church gave hiim liberty to
preach. He began to labor with good success at different plantations. Mr. Sharp gave him his freedom not
long after he began to preach: for about three years he
preached at Brampton and Yarnacraw in the neighborhood of Savannah. On the evacuation of the country,
(1782 and 1783,) lie went to Jamaica. Previous to his
departure he came up from the vessel lying below the
city in the river, and baptized an African woman by the
name of Kate, belonging to Mrs. Eunice Hogg, and
Andrew, his wife Hannah, an(d Hagar, belonging to
the venerable Mr. Jonathan Bryan.
The Baptist cause among the Negroes in Jamaica,
owes its origin to the indefatigable and pious labors of
this worthy man, George Leile.  It does not, come
within my design to introduce an account of his, effor4tHISTORICAL SKETCH;,'i that island; I shall add only that in 1784 he commenced preaching in Kingston, and formed a church, and;
In 1791 had gathered a company of 450 communicants
and commencedl the erection of a, commodious meeting:
house. It finally cost with steeple and bell 4,0001. He,
was alive in 1810 and about sixty years of age.
About nine months after George Leile left Georgia,,
Andrev, surnamed Bryan, a man of good sense, great
zeal, and some natural elocution, began to exlhort his
black brethren and frien(ls. He ar.d his followers were
reprimanded and forbidden to engage further in religious
exercises. He would however pray, sing, and encourage his fellow worshippers to seek the Lord. Their
persecution was carrie(l to an inhuman exterit. Theirevening assemblies wvere broken up and those found
present were punished with stripes!  Andrew Bryana
and Sampson his brother, converted about a year after,
him, were twice imprisoned, and they with about fifty
others were whipped. When publicly whipped, and
bleeding under his wounds, Andrew declared that he
rejoiced not only to be whipped, but would freely suffer
death for the cause of Jesus Christ: and that while he.
had life and opportlunity, he would continue to preach.

continuance in well-doing-, he put to silence and shame(d
his adversaries; and influential advocates and, patrons
were raise(l up for him. Liberty was given: Andrew by
the civil authority to continue his religious meetings
under certain regulations. His master gave him the use
of his barn at Brampton, three miles from Savannah,
wthere he preached for two years, with little interruption.
Not long after Andrew began his ministry he was
4si!ted by the Rev. Thomas Barton, who baptized eigh,

teen of his followers on profession of their faith. The:
next visit was from the Rev. Abraham Marshall of Kioka,
who was accompanied by a young colored preacher, by
the name of Jesse Peter, from the vicinity of Augusta.
On the 20th of January 1788, ATr. Marshall or(lained
Andrew Bryan, baptized fo)rty of his hearers, and constituted them with others, 69 in number, a church, of
which Andrew was the pastor. Such was the origin of
the first colored Baptist church in Savannah.-- Holcwndbe's Letters; Analytical Repository; and Benedict's Hist. of Baptists: from  wlhichl the preceding
account has been taken.
Before dismissing this notice, I cannot forbear introducing the remarks of Dr. Holcombe on Andrew Bryan,
written in 1812.
"Andrew Bryan has, long ago, not only honorably
obtained liberty, but a handsome estate. His fleecy and
well-set locks hlave been -bleached by eighty winters  
and dressed like a bishop of London, he rides, moderately corpulent, in his chair, and with manly features,

color attached to the Methodist Episcopal Church.
These were chiefly in the Southern States, and had been
gathered principally from the slave population.
At an early period of thle Methodist ministry in this
country it had turned its attention and directed its efforts
towards these people, with a view to bring them to the
enjoyment of Gospel blessings. The preachers deplored
with the deepest sympathy their unhappy condition, especially their enslavement to sin and satan; and while
they labored unsuccessfiully by all prudent means to
effect their disenthralment from their civil bondage,
they were amply rewarded for their evangelical efforts
to raise them from- their rmral degradation, by seeing
thousan(ls of them, happily converted to God. These
efforts added much to the labor of the preachers, for
such was the condition of the slaves that they were not
permitted, on working days, to attend the public administration of the word in company with their masters;
and hence the preachers (levoted the evenings to their
instruction after the customary labors of the day were
closed. And although at first there was much aversion
nnanifested by the masters, towaids these. benevolent
efforts to elevate the condition of the slaves;. yet, witnessing the beneficial effects of the Gospel upon their
hearts and lives, they gradually yielded their prejudices
and encouraged the preachers in their labors, assisted in
providing houses to accommodate them in their worship
and otherwise protected them in their religious privileges.
While, thIerefore, the voice of the preachers was not
heard in favor of emancipation from their civil bondage,
nor their remonstrances against the evils of slavery
heeded, the voice of truth a(ddressed to the understandings and consciences of the slaves themselves, was oftenHISTORICAL SKETCH.
heard with believing and obedient hearts and made
instrumental in their deliverance from the shackles of
sin and the bon(lage of satan. Those who were thus
redeemed were enroled among the people of God and
were consequently entitled to the privileges of the
church of Christ. In some of the northern cities houses
of worship were erected for their special and separate
accommodation, and they were put under the pastoral
charge of a white preacher, who was generally assisted
by such colored local preachers as may have been raised
up among themselves; for many such, from   time to
time, possessing gifts for edification, were licensed to
preach the Gospel to their colored bretlhren, and some
of these have been eminently useful. In the more
Southern States, where the municipal regulations in
respect to slaves are more severe, some portion of the
churches where the white population assemble is usually
set apart for the blaclks. Their behaviour has generally
been such as to insure tile confidence of their masters
and the protection of their civil rulers, though they
labored under tile disabilities incident to a state of
servitude."
1799 This year is memorable for the commencement
of that extraordinary awakening wvlich, taking its rise
in Kentuclky and spreading in various directions and
with different degrees of intensity, was denominated,
"' the great Kentucky revival." It continued for above
four years, an(l its influence was felt over a large portion
of the Southern States. Presbyterians, Methodists, and
Baptists participated in this work. In this revival origi.

thousand.
1800. Number of members in connection with the
Methodiists 13,452,'The bishops of the M. E. church
were authorized to ordain African preachers, in places
where there were houses of worship for their use, who
might be chosen by a majolity of the male members of
the society to which they belonged and could procure a
recommendation frorn the preacher in charge and his
colleagues on the circuit, to the office of local deacons.
Richard Allen of Philadelphia was the first colored
man who received orders un(ler this rule.
1803. The second African. church in Savannah
formed out of the first, 26th Dec'r, 1802; and Ilenry
Cunningham elected pastor and ordained to the work of
the ministry, January 1st, 1803. On the 2d of January
1803, another church was formed out of the first, called
the Ogechee 6olorced Baptist Church, and Henry Francis appointed to supply it. Henry Cunningham was a
slave, but obtained his fredom. He is still the pastor of
the 2d African church, far advanced&amp; in life, and from
age unable to attend to his sacred duties, except to a
very limited extent. He still enjoys, (as he has always
enjoyed,) the confidence and esteem of all classes of the
community in which he has lived so long, so virtuously,
and so usefully. The Methodist conferences reported
22,453 colored members- an increase over the last
year of 3,794.

They were very devout, and declared it to be their sincere desire to be truly converted. A few Sundays after
brother Browne (who preached the Gospel to the Negroes
on Staten Island) being here on a visit, preached to
thirty Negroes, anti after the sermon baptized two children. The transaction made such an impression on
two of the ad(ult Negroes that they requested this rite
mighlt be in mr(liately performed on them. They were
however satisfied with the reasons I assigned for defering it till they had received further instruction in Chris.tiarnity. A very affecting scene tooli place at the close
of the meeting. A Negro overseer who was present,

prayer thanked Gord for what their souls hadl enjoyed

and colored communicants.
1813. There wvere 40,000 Negroes connected wvith.
the Baptist denomination in the States of Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Georgia.  The historian remarlks, " that among the
African Baptists inr the Southern States, there are a
imultitude of preachers and exhorters whose names do
inot appear on the mi.nutes of associations. They preach
principally on the plantations to those of their own color,,
and their preaching, though broken and illiterate, is in
many cases highly useful."'
1816. There was a report adopted by the General
Assembly of the Presbyterian chuich in the Unlited
States, on the question, " ought baptism on the lpromise
of the rmaster to be ad3ministered to the children of
slaves?" as follows: 1. that it is the (luty of masters
who are members of the church, to present the children
of parents in servitudle, to the ordinance of Baptism,
provided they are in a situation to train them up in thel
nurture and admonition of the Lord, thus securing to
them the rich advantages which the Gospel promises.HISTORICAL SKETCH.
2. That it is the duty of Christian ministers to inculcate
this doctrine and to baptize all children when presented
to them by their masters."- Minutes of the Assemblyy
The subject of Missions to the Negroes occupied the
attention of the General Assembly, but no plan of missions was carried into effect. Dr. Rice of Virginia was
employed by the committee on missions in the assembly
for a pait of the year, and his labors were encouraging,
as already state(l by Dr. Alexander in his letter, and as
appears also from the Minutes of the Assembly, p. 372.
The Colonization Society was formed this year, and I
notice it, as filrnishing an index to lhe feelings of
many in relation to the improvement of the Negro race.
The Methodists reported this year 42,304 colored
mnembers, and a decrease of 853 since 1815. Dr. Bangs
says, "6this was owing to a defection among the colored
people in the city of Philadelphia, by which upwards of
1,000 in that city witlhdrewv from our church and set up

organized themselves into an independent body, under
the title of the "-African M ethodist Episcopal Church."
At their first general conference in April, 1816, Richard
Allen was elected Bishop.--At the conference in 1828,
Morris Brown was elected joint superintendent with
-Allen: and on the death of Allen, in 1836, Edward Wat.

Pennsylvania, New Yoik, New Jersey, Maryland and
Delaware. There are also some in the Western States
and a few in Upper Canada. In the more Southern
States tile Al't'enites could make no favorable impression, as the:r preachers were not recognized by the
laws of the States, and the Slave population who were
members of our church had( the character of our whliite
ministry pledged as a guarantee for their good beha.
viour."
1818.'Under the report of colored members for this
ye.ar, the same writer remarlis,' "that while there was
an increase of wvhite members, amounting to 9,035, there
was a (lecrease of 4,261 of the colored mernbers."  He
states that this vwas owing to the Allenite secession:
although not all who through its influence (leclared
themselves independent, attached themselves to the
Allenites.
1819. The increase of colored members this year
was but 24: 1819, 39,174, and 1818,:39,150.  The
-smallness of the increase accounted for by the secession
of the Negroes in New York city, amounting to " 14
local preachers and 929 private members, including
class-leadlers, exhorters and stewardls."
A report dated June 14th, 1819, of a committee of
the board of managers of the Bible society of Charleston,
S. C., respecting the progress and present state of religion in South Carolina, will cast some light on the
subject before us. "From  the best information the
committee have been able to obtain, they find that the
Gospel is now preached to about 613 congregation4MISTORICAL SKETCH.,of Protestant Christians; that there are about 292
ordained clergymen who labor amongst them, besides a
a considerable number of domestic miiissionaries, (levoted
and supported by each (lenomination, who (dispense their
labors to such of the people as remnain destitute of an
established ministry. From actual returns and cautious
estimates where such returns have not been obtained,
it appears that in the state there are about 46,000 Protestants who receive the holy communion of the Lord's
Supper. In the city of Charleston upwards of onefourth of the commtunicants arc slaves or free persons
of color; and it is supposed that in thle other parts of
the state the proportion of such communicants may be
estimated at about one-eighth.  In  every  church
they are freely admitted to attend on divine service: in
nost of the churches distinct accommodations are provided for them, and the clergy in general make it a part
of their pastoral car-e to devote frequent and stated
seasons for the religious instruction of catechumen from
amongst the black population."
It may be proper to state in connection with this
report, that from the begini-ing, with scarcely an exception, the Negroes applying for admissiun into the
churches have been un(der the instruction of white ministers or members: have been examined and approved
as candidates for baptism: have been baptized and have
partaken of the Lord's Supper at the same time with
white candidates and members, and been subject to the
same care and discipline; no distinction being made
between the two classes of members in respect to the
privileges and discipline of the churches.
The Episcopal church reported in part the number of

Charleston. The highest number reported was in 1817
328. In 1818 there were 289.
1820. Bishop MhcKendree presented an adldress to
the general conference at Baltimore, in which he took
notice of " the condition of the slaves."  The number
of colored members, by the minutes of conference, was
40,558.
The census of 1800 gave us S9.3,041 Negro slaves and
110,555 free, making a total of 1.003,596. That of
1810 was 1,191,364 slave and 195,643 free: total iNegro
population, 1,387.007. That of 1820, 1,538,064 slave
and 244,020 firee; total 1,782,084.
The imlportation of Africans into our country ceased,
by law, on the 1st of January 1808.''hle traffic was
abolishedl by Virgin-ia in 1778, arid by Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, irn 1780,.
1787, 1788. And before the year 1820 measures were
taken by all the present free states, in which slavery hlad
existed, for bringing the system  to a close. What
special efforts, if any, were made in these states by the
churches, or by societic s, for ttie religious instruction of
the Negroes thus attaining their freedomn, I have no
means of ascertaining with accuracy. From the best
information in my possession special efforts were very
"few and very limited.
As a nation we were scarcely reviving from the Revolution and the excitement of the fornirmation and establishment of our Constitution, when we were involved in a
War with France, which, with its influences, and what
was worse, the infidelity and skepticism which our previous connection with that nation introlduce(d among us,
most seriously affected the interests of religion, and the
deeline was perceptible in a greater or less degree overHISTOR1ICAL SKETCH.
thie whole Union. Not long after, our troubles with
Et3gland began, vwlich resultedl in a fotur years war.
Notwithstan(ling these interruptions, the Spirit of God
was poured out largely in different parts of the country.
Indee(l, the first quarter of the nineteenth century witnessed a remarkable revival of the missioary spirit- in
the American as well as English cllurches.   Many
societies were organized on a large an(d liberal scale;
(in whose existerlce the world has reason to rejoice,) for
the spreading of the Gospel, both at home and( abroad,
as well by the circulation of the scriptures and auxiliary
publications, as by the living teather.
This spirit wro,ught in the hearts of ministers an(d people genelally, and a new and mighty impulse was given to
religion. In the South it awakened marny to see the
spiritual necessities of the Negroes. Many ministers
began to preach partictilarly and more faithfully to them
and to attempt a regilar division of their time on the
Sabbath, between the whites and blacks.   Attcmpts
were also ne -de in some parts of the South, to teach the
Negroes letters, so as to enable them to read the word
of God for themselves. These schools were short-lived
but the fact of their existence, evi(lences that there was
considerable interest Ielt in their religious instruction.
Houses of public worship, exclusively for the use of the.
Negroes, were erected in many of the chief towns, and
they worshipped in them, un(ler the care of white or
colored teachers, In numbers of white churclhes space,
was allowed for the accommodation of the Negroes, in
ghb galeries or in the body of the house below; and
within siglit and hearing of countrv churches, in some

read and explain the scriptures, and pray with their
people.
It is not to) much to say that the religious and physical condition of the Negroes were both improved during
this period. Their inerease was natural and regular,
ranging, every ten years, between 34 and 36 per cent,
As the old stock from Africa (lie(l out of the country the
grosser customs, the ignorance and pagarnism of Africa,

became more attachled to them, were i(lentified in their

Gospel was preaclhed to masters and servants; seivants
having no religion to renounce grew up in the belief of
that of their masters. On the whole, however, but a
minority of the Negroes, and that a small one, attended
regularly the ho,use of God, and takling them as a class,
their religious instruction was extensively and most
seriously neglecled.HISTORICAL SKETCH.
C H APTER III.
THE THIRD PERIOD- From 1820 to 1842--a Period of 22 years.
1821. The Methodist Episcopal Church reported
this year 42,059 colored members in the United States;
and their numbers gradually increasing.
1822. The account of the labors of the Moravian
Brethren by Mr. Schmidt, already referred to, brings
down their labors to 1837, an(d is as follows:
" In January 1822, a Female Auxiliary to the Missionary Society was formed at Salem andl at their special
request an attempt was made to collect the jNegroes into
a separate congregation of their own-a plan which
had, in(leed, long been an object of desire. Brother
Abraham  Steiner was commissioned to make a commencement of the work by holdin.g a monthly preaching
on a plantation about three miles distarnt from Salem,
where the Negro communnicants resided. At his first
sermon there, March: 24th,, 1822, more than fifty black
and colored people were present. After a fervent prayer
he discourse(l on the words of our Saviour, " the Son of
Man is come to seek andl to save that which was lost,"

truths of our religion was combined. May 19th the
Lord's Supper was celebrated with the three persons
who were already comnmunicants as the first fruits of this
infant Negro flock. Great stillness and devotio:- continued to mark the attendance of the Negroes on divine
worship, yet few sought for closer fellowship, so that
this little flock has never to the present day numbered
more than twenty membeY.
A Negro chapel was built in 1823, at the expense of
the Fem,:le Atuxiliary and consecrated by brother Benade,
the Iesident Bishlol), Decermber 28th, in the presence of
near a hundred Negroes and colore(l people, and many
members of the concregation at SAlem. This was followe(d by tile baptism of a married'Negro woman, and
the solemnities of the (lay were closed by a cheerful
love feast, at which the object of our covenant was
explained an(d two Negroes were receive(d into the congregation. It was a (lay of blessing for the Negroes,
many of whorn seeme(l to be deeply affected. Having
now a place of wvorship of their owvn, tbe meetings could
be better adapted to their circumstances. Several sisters
offered themselves, to keep a Sunday school for their
benefit, an(l it was (liligently frequented, not only by
children, but also by adults. This hopefull project was
soon, llowever, painfully interrupted by a law which
passe(l the legislature of North Carolina, forbid(ling any,
school instruction to be imparted to the Negroes;-a
prohibition which likewise operated very intjuriously on
their attendance at the meetings. May 22d, 1833, the
Negroes were calle(l to mourn over the loss of their
faitihfutl and much loved pastor, brother Abraham Steiner,
and his place was supplied by brother John Renatus
Schmidt. For the last year or two, they have manifestedHISTORICAL SKETCH.
a greater desire for the word of life and visited the house
of God more diligently, and our testimony to the sufferings anli death of Jesus appears to find more entrance
into their hearts. In the private meetings of the little
Negro flocl;, and particularly at the holy communion,
the peace of God is powerfillly perceptible.  T''he
company of emancipated Negroes, upwards of twenty
in number, who saile'd last year for Liberia, on the
western coast of Africa, hadl all been diligent attendants
on our meetings an(l former Sun(lay school, and( one of
them was a communticant member of our flock. At
parting they declared with tears that nothing grieved
them so much as the loss of these privileges. They
promised to d levote themselves to the Lord Jesus and to
remairi faithfill to him.
In the f(,urteen years which have elapsed since their
church was (ledicated 10 a(ldults ani( 73 children have
been baptized and 8 received into the congregation.
The little flock consists at present (1837,) of 17 adult
members, 10 of whom are co,imurnicants.
On the settling of the Brethren in' Wachovia, (N. C.,)
it was their most cherishe(l objcct to conmmunicate the
Gospel both to the Indians on the borders of the Southernr States an(d to the Negro population of those States,
amountinig to several thousarl(ls, especially to such as
resided in the neighborhood of our congregations, hoping that they might be favoredl to gather from among
the,m a reward for the t:avail of the Redeenmer's soul.
Special meetings were accordingly commenced at Hope
and Bethany, and elsewliere in the neighborhood of
Salem, and( the Negroes who were numerous in these
districts, were in general diligent in attending them.

their wives, interested themselves with particular affection for the si.iritual welfare of the Negroes in their
vicinity, andt the Lord so blessed their labors to the
hearts of many that they could be admitted to a participation of the Lorl's supper. A thankful remembrance
of their faithful services is still retained by the Negroes.
In tile prosecuitiotn of the missioin amongst the Cherokees, and in the attempt to establish one amongst the
Creek Indians, the Negroes dispersed among them were
not forgotten. Our brethren at Springplace had the
gratification of baptizing the firstling of tllese Negroes
July 29th 1827. He was a native Afiican of the Tjamba
tribe, and was baptize(l into the death of Jesus by the
name of Christian Jacob, continuing faithful to his
Christian profession till his happy end."
T'he Rev. John M1ines, pastor of a church in Leesburg, Va., published, "The Evangelical Catechism, or
a plain and easy system of the principal doctrines and
duties of the Christian religion. Adapted to the use of
Sabbath schools and famlilies: with a new method of
instructing those who cannot read. Richmond 1822."'
His " new method," was what is called " oral instruction;" the scholars repeating the answers after the
teacher until committed to memory. Mr. Mines was
much interested in the religious instruction of the Negroes. In the preface to his catechism, he states that' he had several classes of them (taught by his friends)"
he commen(ds the use of it to masters and mistresses,
as "an humble attempt" to furnish them with appropriate means for the instruction of their servants in religious
knowledge; and he commends it also to "his colored
friends in the United States,", as. a book written " espeHISTORICAL SKETCH.
cially for them," and says, "with the help of God, I
will attend particularly to your spiritual interests while
I live."
1823. Bishop Dehon of the Diocese of South Carolina, lhad all his goo(l feelings excited in behalf of the
Negroes. "In his own congregatiorl he was the laborious and patient minister of tile African; and he encouraged among the masters and mistresses in his flock, that
best kin(dness towar(ds tlheir servants -a concern for
their eternal salvation."  "1 He endeavored to enlighten
the c,ommunnity on this sublject."  "le would gladly embrace opportunities to converse with men of influence
relating to it," etc.- Life, by Dr. Gadsden.
The Rev. Dr. Dalcho, of the Episcopal church,
Charleston, this year issued a valuable pamphlet entitled
"Practical Considerations, founded on the Script.ures,
Relative to the Slave Poptulation of South Caiolina."
Its design is given in tlie first paragraph, namely, "'to
show friom the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, that slavery is not forbidden by the Divine Law:
and at the same time, to prove the necessity of giving
religious instruction to our Negroes."  Dr. Dalcho
mentions that in 1822 there were 316 colored communicants in the Episcopal churches in Charleston, and 200
children in their colored Sunday schools.
A few months before this pamphlet appeared, Dr.
Richard Furman, President of the Baptist State Convention of S. C., in the narne of that convention,
addressed a letter to his Excellency, Govertnor Wilson
giviig' an "Exposition of the Views of the Baptists
relative to the Colored Population in the United States:"'
in which, among other observations, we find the following: 4"Their religious'iatevests claimi a regard fTom:6970      RELIGIOITS INSTRUCTION OF TIlE NEGROES.
their masters of the most serious nature, and it is indispensable."
The lamented Dr. John Htolt Rice, already mentioned
in this Sketclh, presented the subject of the religious
instructionl of the Negroes in a strong light to the consideration of his fellow citizens of Virginia in the
Evanglical Magazine, vol. 8 pp. 613-4.  H-le printed
a sermon on the (luty of masters to educate an(l baptize the
childrlen of their servants. Throllgh his influence many
in Virginlia were induced to give the dltty of the religious
instruction of the Negroes seriots considleration, which
resulted in action  One of his objects in dlevoitng himself
to the establishment of the Prince Edwardl Theological
Semirnary, vwas that a ministry might bo educated at home
and fitted for the fiel(l comnposed as it is, of masters and

of the Episcopal church, delivered an address before the
Agricutltural Society of South Carolina, in whlich ihe
ably an(d largely insists upon the religious instruction of
the Negroes. This address went thlrough two or more
editions and was extensively circulated and with the
happiest effects.
1830. The historian of the Methodist Episcopal
church remarks, " this year several mrnssions were commenced for the special benefit of the slave population in
the States of South Carolina and Georgia. This class
of people had been favored with the labors of the
Methodist ministry from the beginning of its labors in
this country, an(d there were at this time 62,814 of the
colored population in the several states an(d territories
in our church fellowship, most of whom were slaves.
It was found, however, on a closer inspection into their
conditiotn, that there were many that could not be reached
by the ordinary means, and therefoie preachers were
selected who might devote themselves exclusively to
their service."
He alludes particularly to the " Missionary Society of
the Sotith Carolina Conference, Auxiliary to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church,"
of which, at least so far as its efforts respect the
Negro population, the Rev. William  Capers, D. D.,
of Charleston, S. C., is the founder. Ile has been
superinten(lent of these missions to the Negroes from
their commencement and has spared no exertions to extend and render them successfuil. The reports of the
board of managers, drawn up from year to year by himself exhibit the purity and fervor of his zeal in so good
a cause, as well as the remarkable progress which it has
made.
7172      RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIlE NEGROES.
In the winter of 1830 and the spring of 1831, two
Associations of planteis wrere formed in Georgia for the
special object of affording religious instruction to the
Negroes, by their own efforts an(d by missionaries employe(l for the purpose. The first was formed by the
Rev. Joseph Clay Stiles in McIntosh county, embracing
the neighborhood of Ilarris' reck, which continued in
operation for some time, until by the withdrawment of
Mr. Stiles' labors fiom the neighborhood andl the loss
of some of the inhabitants by death and removals it
ceased(. The second was fnrmed in Liberty county by
the Mildway Congregational clhurclh, and the Baptist
church under their respective pastors the Rev. Robert
Quarterman and the IRev. Samuel Spry Law; which
Association, with one suspension from the absence of a
missionary, has continued its operations to the present
time.
One or more associations for the same purpose were
formnedt in St. Luke's Parish, S. C., in which John David
Mungin, Esquire, took an active part.
1831. An address, entitled, "the Religious Instruction of the Negroes," delivere(d before the Associations
of Mcintoslh and Liberty counties, was published and
circulate(l in newspaper and pamphlet form.
1832, Edward R. Laurens, Esquire, delivered an
address before the Agricultural Association of S. C., in
which this (luty in the form of oral instruction, under
proper arrangements is recognised. -Southern Agriculturist, 1832. "A short Catechism for the use of the
colored members on trial of the M. E. Church in South
Carolina: by W. Capers, D. D., Charleston, 1832."
This short catechism was prepared by Dr. Capers, for
the use of the Methodist missions to the Negroes of theIISTORICAL SKETCH.
S. C. conference, and it is used by all the missionaries.
1833   The Missionary Society of the S. C. Conference which had now fairly entered upon its work,
reported that the missions were generally in flourishing
circumstances; that there were 1,395 colored members,
and 490 children under catechetical instruction at the
mission stations. The society also recommended the
establishment of four or five new stations and the appointment of three or four new missionaries for stations
already occupied.-- Report pp. 12-15.
The " First Annual Report," of the Liberty County
Association, was publislied and circulated in twvo editions.
Two essays were read before the presbytery of
Georgia, in April, 1833, one on "The Moral and Religious condition of our coloured population, " and the
other, a " Detail of a Plan for the Moral Improvement
of Negroes on plantations, " by Thomas Savage Clay,
Esq., of Bryan County. They were both published by
order of presbyterv. The " Detail, etc., " by Mr. Clay,
which was in(leed the result of his own experience and
observation on his own plantation for many years, was
extensively circulated an(l received with approbation,
and has (ldone, and still is doing, much good.
In December, of this year, the " Report of the Committee, to whom was referred the subject of the religious
instruction of the Negroes," of the synod of South
Carolina and Georgia was published. To this report a
series of resolutions were subjoined.
1. "'That to impart the Gospel to the Negroes of our
country is a duty which God in hlis providence and in
his word imposes on us. 2. That ih the discharge of
this duty, we separate entirely the civil and religious condition of this people; and while we devote ourselves to the
improvement of latter, we disclaim all interference with

the former. 3. That the plan which we sllall pursue for
their religious instruction shall be that permitted by the
laws of the States constituting the bounds of this synod.
4. That we deem religious instruction to rmaster and
servant every Nway conducive to our interests for this
world and for that wlhich is to come. 5. That every
member of this synod, while he endeavors to awaken
others, shall set the example and begin the religious instruction of the servants of his own household, systematically and perseveringly, as Go(l shall enable him. 6.
That we cannot longer continue to neglect this duty
without incurring the charge of inconsistency in our
Christian character; of unfaithfulness in the (liseharge
of our ministerial duty; and at the same time meeting
the disapprobation of God and our consciences."  The
narrative of religion of the synod, at the same session,
holds the following language: " the synod continue to
feel the same responsibilities and desires on this subject
which they have repeatedly expressed. They rejoice
to find that increasing attention is paid to it on the part
of many who are largely interested as owners in this
class of our population." -Min. pp. 24, 34.
The project of forming a Downestic lMissionary Society, under the care of the synod, with, special reference
to the religious instruction of the Negroes, was somewhat discussed, chiefly in private, and a committee was
appointed by the synod to bring in a repoit at the next
meeting.
The reports from the Episcopal churches in South
Carolina to the convention, evidence(l lmuch attention to
the Negroes. The Rev. Joseph R. Walker, of Beaufort, reported 57 communicants and 234 members of the
Sunday school, which was conducted by the first and
best society in the place.HISTORICAL SKETCH.
Bishop Ives of North Carolina, addressed to his convention, "on the interesting subject of providing for our
slave population a more adequate knowledge of the
doctrines of Christ crucifie(."  He stated in a letter to
Bishop Meade, that active efforts in behalf of this people were made in five or six of the churches, and singled
out the church of St. John's, Fayetteville, embracing
between three and four hundred worshippers of whom
forty were communicants.
There were several religious newspapers, conducted
by different denominations, that advocated openly and
efficierntly, about this time, the religious instruction of
the Negroes: the "' Gospel MP[essenger," Episcopal,
Charleston: the 1" Charleston Observer," Presbyterian:
the " Christian Index," Baptist: the 6" Southern Christian Advocate," Methodist: the "Western Luminary,"'
Kentucky: and there may be added, the " New Orleans
Observer," and the "Southern Churchman," Alexandria; besides others. Through these papers, having an
extensive circulation, the subject was presented to the
minds of thousands of our citizens.
There was published this year. (1833,) "a Plain and
Easy Catechism: designed for the benefit of colored
children, with several verses and hymns, with an appendix: compiled by a missionary: Savannah." This
missionary was a Methodist; the Rev. Samuel J. Bryan,
who labored among the Negroes on the Savannah river
"The encouraging success wrhich hadl attended the
labors of our preachers among the slave and free black
population of the South, stimulated our brethren in the
Southwvest to imitate their example by opening nissions
for the special benefit of this class of people. Hence

African Mission, embracing the colored population of
Nashville and its vicinity was commenced; a regular
four wceek's circuit was formed, and the good work was
prosecuted with such success that in 1834 there were
reported 819 church members." - Bangs 4, p. 143.
1834. "A meeting was held in Petersburg, Va., in
March 1834, compose(l of representatives from the
synods of North Carolina and Virginia. After disposing of the special business for which the meeting was
called, the subject of the religious instruction of the
Negroes was discussed and as a result a committee was
appointed, consisting of three ministers and elters in
each of the States, " to bring before the presbyteries the
subject of ministers giving more religious inristruction to
the colored people; and to collect and( publisli information on the best modes of giving oral instruction to this
class of our population."  That coyn;mittee, of whicl
Rev. William S. Plumer, ID. D., now of Richmoiad, was
the chairman, performed its duty and presented a report
to the synods of North Carolina and( Virginia at their
fall sessions in 1834. The sa.me report, with soine ac.
companying documents was forwar(led to the synod of
South Carolina and Georgia, and iead before that bo(ly
in December, 1834.
The committee of the syno(ls of North Carolina and
Virginia, reported a plan "for forming ca society b,y the
concurrence of two or more synods for the purpose of
afforling religious instruction to the Negroes in a manner consistent with the laws of the States and with the
feelings andl wishles of planters." The plan was laid
before the synod of North Carolila, and acceded to. It
was laid over by the synods of Virginia an(d South CarpWli4 and Georgia, to their sessions in 1835 and then,HISTORICAL SKETCII.
for special reasons, indefinitely postponed. A report
was presented by a committee of the synod of South
Carolina and Georgia, on this planl. The repoit was
adverse to it, on account of the extent of the proposed
organization; the excitement of the times; and the belief that each.synod could of itself conduct the work
more successfully, than when united( with the other two.
The constitttion of the proposed society, the reasons
in favor of it, and Dr. Plumer's report, were all laid
before the public in the columns of the Charleston Observer. The report has been several times referred to
in this Sketch.
Ttle synod of South Carolina and Georgia, December
1834, passed the following resolutions: " 1. That it be
enjoined upon all the churches in the presbyteries comprising this synod, to take order at their earliest meeting to obtain full and correct statistical inforrmation of
the number of colored persons iln actual attendance at
our several places of worship, and the numbei of colored
members in our several churches, and mnalke a full report
to the synod at its next meeting; and for this purpose
that the stated clerk of this synod furnish a copy of
this resolution to the statedl clerk of each presbytery.
2. That it be enjoined on all presbyteries in presenting
their annual report to synodl, to report the state of reli.
gion in the colored part of their congregations, and also
to present a statistical report of the increase of colored
members, and that this be the standiing rule of synod
on this sulbject."  The narative states "that increasing
efforts had been made to impart religious instruction to
the Negroes." - Mi?i. pp. 22, 29.
The synod of Mlississippi and Alabama, in their nar.
rative, November 1, 1834, say, "another very encour.

aging circumstance in the situation of our churches is
the deep interest which is 1elt in behalf of our colored
population, aind the efforts which are madle to impart to
them religious instruction. All our ministers feel a deep
interest in the instruction of this part of our population,
and when prudently conducted we meet with no opposition. A few of us, owing to peculiar circumstances,
have no opportunity of preaching to them separately and
at stated titnes; but embrace every favorable opportunity that occurs.  Others devote a portion of every
Sabbath; others a half of every Sabbath; and two of
our number preaclh exclusively to them. During the
past year the condition an(I wants of the colore(l population, have occupied more of our attention than at any
previous period, and in future we hope to be more untiring in all oulr effoits to promote their happiness in this
life and in that which is to comne"  In their resolutions
this synod enjoined all under their care directly to make
" unitedl efforts to provide means for the employment of
missionlaries to give oral instruction to the colored population on the plantations wtith the permission of those
persons to vwhom they bclong."
In this same year, (IS34,) " the Kentucky Union, for
the moral and religious improvement of the colored
race," was formed, and a "' circular" ad(dressed to the
nministers of the Gospel in Kentucky, by the executive
committee of that Union; to whic.lh the constitution was
appended. It was a "union of the several denominations of christians, in the State."  The Rev. H. H.
Cavanaugh was president; there were ten vice presidents, selected from (lifferent quarters of the State; and
an cxecutive conmmittee of seven memnbers located in
Danville, of which lRev. Jolln C. Young was chairman.HISTORICAL SKETCII.
President Young told me at the general assembly of 1839
that this Union hadi not accomplishe(l much.
The "secoind annual report " of the Liberty County
Association was published, giving some good account of
their operations. "'An Essay on the Management of
Slaves, and especially on their religious instruction,"
read before the agricultural society of St. John's Colleton, S. C., by Whitemarsh B. Seabrook, president, was
published by the society. Mr. Seabrook reviews some
former publications on the religious instruction of the
Negroes, and suggests his owvn plans and views on the
subject. The Right Reverend William Mea(le, Assistant
Bishop of Virginia, published an admirable "pastoral
letter, to the ministers, members, and firiends of the
Protestant Episcopal Church in the diocese of Virginia,
on the tluty of affording religious instruction to those
in bondage."   The Bishop in his zeal and personal
efforts on this subject, demonstrates the sincerity of his
publishedl opinions.'lhe missionary society of the S. C. conference reported five missionaries to the blacks, in N. C. onc, the
rest in S. C., and 2,145 members and 1,503 childien
under catechetical instruction.
"The Colored Inan's HIelp: or the Planters CatechismI: RIichLmond, Va." was nowv published.
Also, in the "Charleston Observer," " Biograpllies

Also, " A Catechism for Colored Persons. By C. C.
Jones, " printed in Charleston.
1835. "The Third Annual Report of the Liberty
County Associatiot, " was printed and more extensively
circulated than the two preceeding.
In the narrative of the state of religion in the synod
of South Carolina and Georgia, it is said: " even
the religious instruction of our slave population, entirely suspended in some parts of the country, through the
lamentable interference olf abolition, fanatics has proceeded with almost unabated diligence and steadiness of
purpose through the length and breadth of our Synod."
Min. 1835, p. 62.
Bishop Bowen of the diocese of S. C. prepared at
the request of the convention and printed, " A Pastoral
Letter on tile Religious Instruction of the slaves of members of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the State of
Soutll Carolina;9" to which he appended " Scripture
Lessons," for the same.
The subject had been presented to the Convention by
an able report froinm a commnittee and a portion of the
report, was embodied in Bishop Bowen's letter.
The Missionary Society of the S. C. conference reported this year, 2,603 members, and 1,330 children
under catechetical instruiction.
1836. The Rev. George W. Freeman, late Rector
of Christs' Church Raleigh, N. C. published two discourses on " The Rights and Duties of Slaveholders."'HISTORICAL SKETCH.
Mr. Freeman with pathos and energy, urges upon masters and mistresses the duty of rieligious instruction. -p.

The report of the Liberty County Association was
prepared, but not published this pear. The operations
of the Association during the year had been successful.
The bishops of the M. E. Church in the United States,
in their letter of reply to the letter from  the Wesleyani Methodist Conference, England, held the following language: "It may be pertinent to remark that of
the colore(l population in the Southern anti Southl-western States, there are not less than 70,000 in o(tr  chiurch
membership; and that in addition to those who are mingled with our white congregations, we have several prosperous missions exclusively for their spiritual benefit,
which have been and are still owned of God, to tl e conversion of nany precious souls. On the plantations of
tthe South anmd South-west our devoted missionaries are
laboring for tile salvation of the slaves, catechising their
children and bringing all within their influence, as Iar as
possible to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ; and
we need hardly addl, that we shall rmost gladly avail ourselves, as we have ever done, of all the rneans in our
power to promote their best interests.'  The total number of colored members reportedl for 183,-}, was 82,661I
1837, 1838. The subject of the religious instruction
of the Negroes was called up antid attended to in the
syno(l of South Carolina and Georgia both these years,
and many Sun(lay schools for childtren and adults reported fromn the different presbyteries. It also received
attention in all the sollthcrn synods. There appeared
to be a growing conviction of the duty itself, an(d on the
whole an increase of efforts.
8182      RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF TIlE NEGROES.
The instruction of the Negroes in Liberty county, by
the Association, was carried forward as usual during the
summers of these years, but in consequence of the absence of the missionary in the winters, no reports were
published.
The Missionary Society of the South Carolina conference prosecuted its work with encouraging success.
In an annual mneeting in the town of Colunmbia, S. C.,
they collected for their missions to the Neogroes between
twelve and fifteen hundred dollars.
Bishop Meade collected and published "Sermons, Dialogues and Narratives for servants, to be read to them
in families: Richmond, 1836."
The second edition of "the Catechism for colored
persons," by C. C. Jones: Savannah,'. Purse, 1837.
Also, "a Catechism to be used by the teachers in the
religious instruction of persons of color, etc.: prepared
in conforimity to a resolution of the Convention, under
the direction of the Bishop: Charleston."  The Reveretnd gentlemen of the diocese of South Carolina who
united in preparing this catecliism, were Dr. Gadsden,
(now Bishop,) MIr. T. Trapier, and Mr. William H.
Barnwell.
The following resolution was passed in the Episcopal
convention of South Carolina in 1838:  "Resolved,'IThlat it be respectfully recommended to the members of
our church, who are proprietors of slaves individually
and collectively, to take measures for the support of
clerical missionaries and lay catechists who are members of our church, for the religious ipstruction of their
slaves." And again, "Resolved, That it be urged upon
the rectors and vestries of the country parishes, to exert
themselves to obtain the services of such clerical missionaries and lay catechists."HISTORICAL SKETCH.
1839, 1840. From the reports of the Liberty county
Association for these years, it appears that a revival of
religion commenced toward the close of the summer of
1838 among the Negroes, and extended very nearly over
tile whole county, an(l continued for two years. The
whole number received into the Congregational and
Baptist churches, on profession of their faith, was fully
two hundred and fifty. The number of adults and children under catechetical instruction in the Sabbath
schools connected with the Association and in the different churches, ranged from five to seven, hundred.
The Missionary Society of South Carolina Conference reported in 1839, 13 missions, 210 plantations, 19
missionaries, 5,482 church members, and 3,769 children
catechised. In 1840, 13 missions, 232 plantations, 19
missionaries, 5,482 members, and 3,811 children. - 11iinutes.
