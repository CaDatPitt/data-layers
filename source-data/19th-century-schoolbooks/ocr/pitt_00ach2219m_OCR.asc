-the best usage of-the language appropriates to it; in opposition to broad,
vulgar, or provincial pronunciation.'This is requisite both for reading intelligibly, and for reading with correctness and ease. Instructions concerning this article may be- best given by the living teaeher. But there is
one observation, wlhich it, may not be improper here to make. In the English language, every word which consists of more syllables than one, lhas
one accented syllable. The accents rest sometimes on the vowel, sometimes on the consonant. The genius of the language requires the voice to'mark that syllable by a stuonger percussion., and to pass more slightly over
the rest. Now, after we have learned.the proper seats of these accents, it
is an important rule, to give every word just the same accent in reading, as
in common discourse. Manyfpersons err in this respect.  When they read
to others, and with solemnity, they pronounce the syllables in a diflerent
mannes from what they do at other times. They dwell" upon them  and
protract them; they multiply accents on the same word; from. a mistaken
notion, that it givesg'avity and importance to their'subject, andadds to ths
energy of their delivery.   Whereas this is one of the greatest faults that
can be committedln pronunciation: it makes what is called a pompous or
mouthing manrner; anid'gives an artificial, affected air. to reading, whicln
detracts greatly both from its agreeableness and its impression.
Sheridan and Walker have published Dictionaries, for ascertaining the
true and best pronunciation of the Words of our language. By attentively
consulting them, particularly "- Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary," the
young reader will be much assisted, in his endeavours to attain a cQrrect
pronunciation of the words belonging to the English language.
SIECTION V.
Emplasis.
Br Emphasis is meant a stronger and fuller sound of voice,. by which we
distinguishl some word or words, on which we design to lay particular stress,
and to show how they affect the rest of.the sentence. Sometimes the emphatic words must-be distinguished by a particular tone of voice, as well
as by a particular stress. On the right imanagement of' the emphasis depends the life of pronunciation. If no emphasis be placed on any words,
not only is discoulrse rendered heavy and lifeless, but the meaning left often
ambiguous. Jf tile emphasis be placed wrong, we pervert and confound
the meaning wholly.
Emphasis may be divide(d into the Superior and the Intferior emphasis.
The superior emphasis determines the meaning of a sentence, with reference
to something said before, presupposed by the author as general knowledge,
or removes an ambiguity, where a passage may have more senses than
one. The inferiqr emphasis enforces, graces, and enlivtns, but does not
fix, the meaning of any passage. The words.to which this latter emphasis
is given, are, in general, such as seem the most importatnt in the sentence,
or, on other accounts, to merit this distinction. The following passage
will serve to exemplify the superior emphasis.
"Of man's first disobedienre, and the fruit'- Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
"Brought death into the world, and all our We," &amp;c.' "Sing heavenly Muse: "''where he contermns; who is not at liberty to appear in his own
colours, ncr to speak his own sentiments; who dares not be'
honest, lest he should' be poor!-Believe it, no chains bind so'bard, no fetters are so heavy, as those which fasten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world; no dependence is more
contemptible than that under which the voluptuous, the *covetous, or the ambitious man, lies to the m eans of pleasure, gain, -
or power. Yet this is the boasted liberty, which vice promises,
as the recompense of setting us fiee from the salutary re;straints of virtue.                                   BLAIR,,

The man of integrity.
IT will #ot take much time to delineate the character of the
m:n of integrity, as by its nature it is a plain one, and easily
un,dl(rstood.  ie is 6ne, who makes it his constant rule,to folloTw the road of duty, according, as the word of God, and the
voice of his conscience, point it out to him. He is not guided
merely by. affections, which may sometimes give the c6lour of
virtue to a loose and unstable character.  The upright mall s
guided by a fixed principle of mind, which determines him to
esteem nothing biAt what is honourable; and to abhor whatever is base or unworthy, in moral conduct.  Hence we find
him ever the same; at all times, the trusty friend, the af
fectionate^ relatidn, the conscientious man of business, the
pious worshipper, the public spirited citizen.  Heassumes no
borrow'ed appearance.  He seeks rno mask to cover him; fo'
he acts no studied part; bit he is indeed what he appears to'
be,'full of:tAth, candour, and humanity.  In all his pursuits,_
he knows no path, but [L4e fair'and direct one; and would
much rather fail of success, than attain it by reproachful
means.  He never sh6ws us a smiling countenance, while he
meditates evil against us in his heart.  Ile never praises us
amoing' our friends; and then joins in traducing us armong
our enemies.  We shall never find one part of his cha-racter
at variance with another, In his manners, he is simple and
nunaffected; in all, his proceedings, open and-consistent.

without opposition, to every encroachment of the violent and
assuming, forms no part of Christian duty; but, on the c6ntrary, is destructive of general happiness and order.  That
unlimite:l complaisance, which, on every occasion, falls in with
the opinions and manrers of others, is so far from being a virtue, that it is itself a vice, and the parent of many vices.  It
overthrows all steadiness of principle; and produces that sinful conformity with the world, ~Which taints the whole character.  In the present corrupted state of human manners, al- ways to assent and to comply, is the very worst maxim we
can adopt. It is impossible to stupport the purity and dignity
of Christian morals, without opposing  ttie world on various
occasions, even though we should stand alone.  TrIhat gentleness therefore which belongs to virtue, is to be carefully distinguished from,the mean spirit of ccwards, apd the fawning
assent of sycophants.  It renounces no just right fiom fearA
It gives up no important truth from flattery.  It is indeed not
only consistent with a firm mind, but it necessarily requires a
manly spirit, and a fixed princille, in order to give it any real
value.  Upon this solid ground only, the polish of genfleess
can with advantage be superinduced.
It stands opposed, not to the most determed regard for
virtue and truth, but to harshnress and severity, to pride and
4rrogance, to violence and' oppression.  It is propierjy, that
part of thegreat virtue of charity, which makes us unwilling
to give paito any of our brethren.  Compassiorrprompts us
to relieve their wants.  Forbearance prevents us from retaliating their injuries.  Mleekness restrains our angry passions;
candour, oul severe judgments.  Gentleness cdrrects whatever is offensive in our manners;' nd, by a constant train of
humanre attentions, studies to alleviate the burden of common
misery.  Its office, therefore, is extensive.  It is not, like
some other virtues, called forth only on peculiar emergencies;
but it is continually in action, when we are engaged in intercourse with men.  It ought to form our address, to regulate
our speech, and to diffuse itself over our whole behaviour.
We must not, however, confound this gentle "wisdom which
is from  above," with that artificial courtesy, that studied
smoothness of marnmers, which is learned in the sch6ol of the
world.  Such accomplishments, the most frivoloUis and empty
may possess. Too often they are employed by the artfAl, as.
a'snare; too often affected by- the hardand unfeeling, s a
cover to. the baseness of their minds. We cannot, at the sa e
time, avoid, observing the homae,' which, even in such: i-';stances, the world is constrained I pay to virtue.  In order
to render society agreeable, it is found necessary- to assume
somewhat, that miay at least carry its appearance.  Virtue is
the universal charm.  Even its shadow is courted, when the
subitance is wanting.  The imitation of its form has been reduced into an art; and, in the commerce of life, the first
study of all who would either gain the esteem, or win the
hearts of others, is to learn the speech, nd to adopt the manners. of _candour, gentleness, and humanity.  Biit that gentleness which is the characteristic of a good man, has, like
every other virtue, its seat in the heart; and let me add, nothing except what flows from the heart, can render even external manners truly pleasing.  For no assumed behaviour
can at all times hide the real' character.  In that unaffected
civility which springs frohn a g-ntle mind, there is a charm
infinitely more powerful, than in all the studied manners of
the most finished courtier.
True gentleness is founded on a sense of what we owe to
HIM who made us, and to the common nature of which we all
share.  It arises from  reflection  on our own failings and
wants; and from just views of the condition, and the duty of
man.  It is natie feeling, heightened arid improveed by prin
~iple.  It is the heart which easily relents; which feels for:
every thing that is human; and is backward and slow to inflict the least wound.  It is affable in its addressizand mild in
its demeanour; ever ready to oblige, rand willing t:fbe obliged
by others; breathing habitual kindness towards fiiends, courtesy to strang-2rs, long--sffering to enemies.  It exercises authority with' moderation; administers reproof with tenderness; confers favours with ease and modesty.  It is unassumingin. opinion, and temperate in zeal. It contends not eagerly
about trifles; slow to contradict, and still slower to blame;
but-prompt to allay dissension, and' restore peace.  It neither intermeddles unnecessarily with the affairs, nor pries inquisitively into the secrets of others.  It delights above all
things to?lleviate distress; and, if it cannot dry up the falling
tear, to sooth at least the grieving heart.  Whete it has not
the power of e.ing useful, it is never burdensome. It seeks
to please, ratherA than-to shine and dazzle; and conceals with
care that superiority, either of talents or of rank, which is
oppressive to those who are- beneath it.  In a word, it is that
spirit and-tha( tenour of manners, which the gospel of' Christ
enjoins, W-en it commands us, "to bear one another's burtdens;  to rejoie with thosewho- rejoice, and to weep: wtb

Trial and execution of the EARL of STRAFFORD, who fell a
sacrzfice to the violence of the times, in the reigrof CHnARLES
the: First.
THE earl of Strafford defended hlimself against the accusations of the house of Commons, with all the presence of mind,
judgment, and sagacity, that could' be expected from innercence and ability.- His children were placed besidq him, as.he was thus defending his life, and the cause of his royal master. After he had, in a long and eloquent speech, delivAred
without pfremeditation, confuted all the accusations of his enemies, he thus drew to a conclusion.  "But, my lords, I have:
troubled you too long: longer than I should have done, but
for the sake of these dear pledges, which a saint in heaven has
left me."-Upon this he paused; dropped a tear; looked upon
his children; and proceeded.-",What I forfdit for myself is
a trifle: that my indiscretions.should reach my posterity,
wounds me to the heart.  Pardon my infirtnity.--Something
I should have added, but I am not able; and therefore I let it
pass.  And now, my lords, for myself. I bhave long been
taught, that the afflictions of this life are overpaid by that
eternal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent.  And so,
my lords, even so, with the utmost tranquillity, I submit my..
self to your judgment, whether that judgment bf'e or
death:. not my will, but thine, 0 God, be done!"  
His eloquence'nd innocence induced those judges to pgity,
who were the most zealous to condemn him.  The kinghiimself went to the house of lords, and spoke for~:oje tioe inhis defence; but the spirit of vengeance, which, had been
chained for eleven years, was now roused; and nothing but
his blood could give the people satisfaction.  He was condemned by both houses of parliament; and nothing remained  
but for the king to'give his consernt to the bill of attainder.  
But in- the: present commotions, the consent -of the kiiig

would  ery easily be dispensed -with; and imminent danger
might- attend his refusal.  Charles, however, who loved
Strafford tenderly, hesitated, and seemed reluctant;.trying
every expedient to put off so dreadful an office, as that of
signing the warrant for his execution. While he continued
in this agitation of mind, and state of suspense, his doubts
were at last silenced by an act of great magnanimity in the
condemned lord. He received a letter from that unfortunate
nobleman, desiring that his life might be niade a sacrifice to
obtain reconciliation between theking and his people: adding, that he was prepared to die; and that to a willing mind
there could -be no injury. This instance of noble generosity
was but ill repaid by his master, who complied with his request. He consented to sign the fatal bill by commission;
and Strafford was beheaded on Tower-hill; behaving with all
that composed dignity of resolution, which was expected from
his character.-                                 GOLDSMITII.
SECTION II.
An emninent instance of true fortitude.
- ArLL who have been'distinguished as servants of God, or
benefactors of men; all who, in perilous situations, have
acted their part with such honour as to render their names
illustrisus through succeeding ages, have been eminent for
fortitude of mind. Of this we have one conspicuous example
in the apostle Paul, whom it will be instructive for us to view
in a remarkable occurrence of his life. After having long
acted as the apostle of the Gentiles, his mtssion called him to
go to Jerusalem, where he knew that he was to encounter the
utmost violence of his enemies. Just before he set sail, hecalled together the elders of his favourite church at Ephesus,
and, in a pathetic speech, which does great honour to his
character, gave them his last farewell. Deeply affected by,
their knowledge of the certain dangers to which he was exposing himself, all the assembly were filled with distress, and,
melted into tears. The circumstances were such, as might
have conveyed dejection even into a resolute mind; and
wowld have totally overwhelmed the feeble.  "They all wept
sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him; sorrowing most
of all for the word swhich he spoke, that they should see his
face-no molre."- -What were -then the sentiments, -what was
the language, of this great and good jnan? Hear theords
which poke his firm and undaunted mind.  "Behol, I go
bound in the spirit, ltb kerusalem, not knowing the th:iug thatC(.hap. 6.           Pathe tic Pieces.                103
shall befall me ihere; save that the HIoly Spirit witnesseth
in every -city, saying, that bonds and afflictions abide me. But
none of these things move me; neither count I my life dear
to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the:
ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify
the gospel of the grace of God."  There was uttered the
voice, there breathed the spirit, of a brave and a virtuous
man. Such a man knows not what it -is to shrink from danger, when conscience points out his path.  In that path he is
determined to walk, let the consequences be what they may.
This was the magnanimous behaviour of that great apostle,
when he had persecution and distress full in view. Attend
now to the sentiments of the- same -excellent man, when the
time of his last suffering approached; and remark the majesty, and the ease, with wihich. he looked on death. " I am
now ready to be offered, and the time of my depirture is at
hand. I have fought the good fight.! have finished my
course.  I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laidup
for me a crown of righteousness."  How many years of life
does such a dying moment overbalance.  Who would not
choose, in this manner, to go off the stage, with such a song
of triumph in his mouth, rather than prolong his existence
through a wretched old age, stained with sin and shame?

The good man's comfort inaffliction.  
The- religion of Christ not only arms us with fortitude'
against the approach of evil; but, supposing evils to fall upon  
us with their heaviest pressure, it lightens-the load by many
consolations to' which -others are strangers.  While bad men
trace, in the calamities with which they are yisited, the hand
of an offended -sovereign, Christians are taugt; o view them:
as the well-intended chastisements of a merc    Father.&gt;
They hear amidst them, that still voice which 3a    conscience brings to their ear: " Fear not, for I am withee:
be not dismayed, for I am thy God."  They apply to th:
selves the comfortable promises with which the, go
abounds. u They discover in these the happy isstue decree  to
their troubles; anid wait with patience till Providenex shall
have accomplish-ed its great and good designs. In -the  ean

gotten, where its tumults are hushed, and its miseries disappear; where greate-i  objects open to-our view than any which
the world presents; where a more serene sky shines, and a
sweeter and calmer light beams: on the afflicted heart.  In
those moments of devotion, a pious man, pouring out his wants
and sorrows to an Almighty Supporter, feelsthat he is not left
solitary and forsaken in a vale of wo. God is with him;
Christ and the holy Spirit are with him; and though he
should be bereaved of eve-ry friend on earth, he can look up
jn heaven to a Friend that will never desert him.    BLA-,
SECTION IV.
The close of life.
VHEN we contemplate the close of life; the termination of
man's designs and hopes; the silence that now reigns among
those who, a little while ago, were so busy, or so gay; who
can avoid being touched with sensations at once awful and
tender? What heart but' then warms with the glow of humanity? In whose eye does not the tear gather,- on revolving
the fate of passing and short-lived man?
Behold the poor man who lays down at last the burden of
his wearisome life. No more shall he groan under the load
of poverty and toil. No more shall he hear the insolent calls
of the master, from whom he received his scanty wages.  no /
more shall he be raised from needful slumber on his bed of
straw, nor be hurried away from his homely meal, to undergo
the repeated labours-of the day. While his humble grave is
preparing, and a few poor and decayed neighbours are carrying him thither, it is gdod for us to- think, that this man too
was our brother; that for him the aged and destitute wife, and
-the needy children, now weep; that, neglected as he was by
the world, he possessed, perhaps, both a sound understanding,
and a Wvorthy heart; and is. now carried by angels to rest in
Abraham's bosom.-At no great distan6e from him, the grave
is opened to receive the rich and proud mnan. For, as it is
said with emphasis in the parable, "'the rich man also died,
and was buried."  He also died. His riches prevented not
his sharing the same fatevith the poor man; perhaps, through
luxury, they- accelerated his doom., Then, indeed,-' the
mourners go about the streets;" and, while, in all the pomp
and magnificence of wo, his funeral is preparing, his ieirs,
impatient to examine his will, are looking on one a

coffin of the smiling infmlnt; the flower just nipped as it began
to blossom in the parent's view: and the next day, we behold'
the young man, or young woman, of blooming form and pro-,.
mising hopes, laid in an untimely grave.  While the funeral
is attended by a numerous unconcerned company, who are
discoursing to one another about thte news of' the day, or the
ordinary affairs of life,'let our thoughts rather follow to the
house of mourning, and represent to themselves what is passing there.  There we s-hould see a disconsolate family, sitting
in silent grief, thinking of the sad breach that is made in their
little society; and with tears in their eyes, looking to the
chamber that is now left vacant, and to every memorial that
presents itself of their departed friend.  By such attention to
the woes of others, -.the selfish hardness of our hearts will be
gradually softened, and melted down into humanity.
Another day, we follow to thCegrave, one who, in old age,
and after a long career of life, has in ftll maturity sunk at last
into rest.  As we are going along to the mansion of the dead,
it is natural for s to think, and to'liscourse, of all the chang.
es which such a,person has seen during the course of his life.
lie has passed, it is likely, through varieties of fortune.  He.
has experienced prosperity, and adversity.  He has seen -fa
mi}ies and kindreds' rise and fall.  He has seen peace and war
succeeding in their turns;- the face' of his country undergoing
many alte'rations; and the very city in which he dwelt,-rising,
in a manner, new around him. After all he has beheld, his
eyes are now closed for ever.  He was becoming a stranger  -
in the midst of a new succession of men.  A race who knew
him not, had arisen to fill the earth.-Thus passes the world
away-.  Throughout all ranks and conditions, "one generatiora
passeth, and.nother generation cometh;" and this great in:n is
by turns evacuated and replenished, by troops of succeeding
pilgrims.  O vain and inconstant world! O fleeting and tran-:"
sient life'! When will the sons of men learn to think of thee
as  hey- ought? When will they learn humanity from the af-.

separated from all the dregs of.he human mass, from that
mixed and polluted crowd in the midst of which they now
dwell, they shall be permitted to'mingle with prophets, patriarchs, and apostles, with all those great and illustrious spirits, who have shone in former ages as the servants of God,
or the benefactors of mien  whose deeds we are accustomed
to celebrate;.whose steps we now follow at a distance; and
whose names we pronounce with veneration.

ruler of the land of Egypt; and in every station acquiring, by
his virtuie and wisdom, favour with God and man. When
overseer of Potiphar's houlse, his fidelity was proved by strong
temptations, which he honourably resisted.  When thrown
into prison by the artifices of a false woman, his integrity and
prudence soon rendered him conspicuous, even in that dark
mansion.  When called into the presence of Pharaoh, the
wise and extensive plan which he formed for saving the kingdom from the miseries of impending famine, justly raised him
to a high station, wherein his abilities were eminently displayed in the public service.  But in.his whole history, there is
no circumstance so striking and interesting, as his behaviour
to his brethren xVho liad sold him into slavery.  The momen;t
in which he made hiimself known to them, was the most critical 6one of his life, and the most decisive of his. character.
It is such as rarely occurs in the course of human events; and
is calculated to draw the highest attention of all who are endowed with any degree of sensibility of heart.
From the whole tenour of the narration it apl4ars, that
though Joseph, upon the arrival of his brethren in Egypt,
made himself strange to them,, yet from the beginning he intended to discover himself; and studied so to conduct the discovery, as might' render the surprise of joy complete. For this'  
end, by affected'severity, he took measures for bringing
down into Egypt all his fat-her's children.  They were now
arrived there; and Benjamin among the rest, who was his
younger brother by the samemother, and was particularly beloved by Joseph.  Him he threatened to detain; and seemed
willing to allow the rest to depart.  This incident renewed
their distress.  They all linew their father's extreme anxiety
about the safety of Benjamin, and with what difficulty lie had
yielded to his undertaking this journey. Should he be prevented from returning, they dreaded that grief would overpower the old man's spirits, and prove fatal to his life.  Ju--
dah, therefore, who had particularly urged the necessity of
Benjamin's accompanying his brothers, and had solemnly
pledged himself to their father for his safe retrurn, craved, upon this occasion, an audience of the governor; and gave him
a full accoulnt of the circumstances of Jacob's fhamily.
Nothing can be more interestincg and pathetic thatn this discourse of Judah.  Little knowing to whom  he spoke, he
paints in all the colours of simple and natural eloquence, the
distressed situation of the a;ged patriarch, hasteninz to the close
of life; long afflicted for the loss of a faivourite s`n' whom h.'-apposing- tOwriginally other b eiqg, besides men, had disobsyld th.
commands df the Almighty, and that the circustance were well know*
to us, there would fall an emphasis upon the word ma's in the first. li
and- hence it would read thus:  
"Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit," sec.
But iflt were a notorious truth, that mankind had transgressed in a
p,culiar manner nw.re than once, the emphasis would fall onfirst; and the-,
lne'be reads
"f man's first disobedience," &amp;c,
Again, admitting death (as was really the case) to have ben an urt;
heard of and dreadful punishment, brought upon man in consequence
of his transgression; on that supposition the third line would be read.
", Brought death into the world," &amp;c. --.
Buat if we were to suppose that mankind knew there was such an evil.p
death in other regions, though the place they inhabitedhad boe4 fre* frow
it-tilhtheir- tansgression, the line would run thus:

bouring now under anxious concern about his youngest son,
the child of his old age, who alon-e'was left alive of his mother,
and whom nothing buit the calamities of severe famine could
have moved a tender father to send from home, and expose to
the dangers of a foreign land.  " If we bring himin not back
with us, we shall bring doin the gray hairs of thy servant,
our father, with sorrow, to the grave.  I pray thee therefore
let thy servant abide, instead of the young man, a. bondman to
our lord.  For how shall I go up to my father, and Benjamin
not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father."
Upon this relation Joseph could no longer restrain himself.
Thle tender ideas of his father, and his father's house, of his
ancient home, his country, and his kindred, of the distress of
his family, and his- own exaltation, all rushed too strongly upon his mind to bear any farther concealment.  " He cried,
Caulse every man to go out from me; and he wept aloud."
The tears which he shed wve-re not the tears of grief.  They
were the:irst of affection. They were the effirsions of a
heart overflowing with all the tender sensibilities of nature.
F-ormerly he had been moved in the same manner, when he
first saw his brethren before him. " His bowels yearned upon
them; he sought for a place where to weep.  He went into
his chamber; and then washed his face and returned to them.".At that period his generous plans were not completed.  But
riow,--vhen -there was no farther occasion for constraining
himself, he gave free vent to the strong emotions of his heart,
The first minister to the king of Egypt was not ashamed toshow, that he felt as a man, and a brother.  " He wept aloud;
and the Egyptians, and the house of Pharaoh, heard him."
The first words which his swelling heart allowed him to
pronounce, are the most suitable to such an affecting situation
that were ever uttered;-" I am Joseph; doth my father yet
live?"-What could he, what ought he, in'that impassioned
moment, to have said more? This is the voice of nature herself, speaking her-own language; and it penetrates the heart:
no-pomp of expression; no parade of kindness; but strong
affection hastening to utter what it strongly felt.  " His brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at hispresence."  Their silence is as expressive of those emotions
of repentance and shame, which, on this amazing discovery,
tilled their breasts, and stopped their utterahce, as the few
words which Joseph speaks, are expressive of the generous
agitations which s'truggled for vent within him. No painter

SECTION VII.
ALTAMONT.
The following account of an afflecting, mournful exit, is related
by Dr. Young, who was present a.t the melancholy scene.
THE sad evening before the death of the noble youth, whose
last hours suggested the most solemn and awful reflections, I
was with him.  No one was present, but his physician, and an
intimate whom he loved, and whom he had ruin'ed. At my
coming in, he said, " You and the physician are come too
late. I have neither life nor hope. You both aim at miracles. You would raise the dead!" Heaven, I said, was merciful-" Or," exclaimed he,--" I could not have been thus
guilty. What has it not done to bless and to save me!-I have
been too strong for Omnipotence! I have plucked down
ruin."   I said, the blessed Redeemer,--'" Hold! hold! you
wound me!-That is the rock on which I split:-I denied his
name!"
Refusing to hear any thing from me, or take anyvthing
from the physician, he lay silent, as far as sudden darts of pain
would permit, till the clock struck:'Then with vehemenfce
he exclaimed; " Oh! time! time! it is fit thou shouldst thus
strike thy murderer to the heart!-How  art thou fled for
ever!--A month!--Oh, for a single week! I ask not for
years! though an age were too little i,)r the much I bave to
do."  On my saying, we could not do too inuch: tat heaven
was a blessed place--" So muclh the worse.--'Tlst!'tis
lost!-Heaven is to me the severest part of heil l!'T":
Soon after, I proposed prayer,-" Pray you thatcan, I
never prayed.  I cannot pray-nor need I.  Is not Heavren
on my side already? It closes with my conscience._ Its severest strokes but second my own."  Observing th: t his
friend was much touched at this, even to tears-(who could
forbear? I could not)--with a most affectionate look he said,
Ti

"Keep those tears for thlyself.  I have undone thee.-Dost
thou weep forl me? that is cruel.  What can pain me more?"
H1ere his friend, too much affected, would have left him.--
" No, stay-thou still mayst hope; therefore hear me. How
madly have I talked! i-Iowv m-idly hast thou listened and believed! but look on my present state, as a full answer to thee,
and to myself. This body is all weakness and pain; but my
soul, as if stung up by torment to greater strength and spirit,
is full powerful to reason; full mighty to suffer.  And that,
which thus triumphs within the jaws of immortality, is, doubtless, immortal-And, as for a Deity, nothing less than an Almighty could inflict what - feel."  
I was about to congratulate this passive, involuntary confessor, on his asserting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature, when he thus, very passionately
exclaimed:--" No, no! let me speak on. I have not long to
speak.--My much injured friend! my soul, as my body, lies
in ruins; in scattered fragments of broken thought--Remorse
for the past, throws my thought on the filture. Worse dread
of the future, strikes it back on the past. I turn, and turn, and' find no ray.  Didst thou feel half the mountain that is on me,
thou wouldst struggle with the martyr for his stake; and bless
Heaven for the flames!-that is not an everlasting flanme; that
is not an unquenchable fire."
How were we struck! yet, soon after, still more. With
what an eye of distraction, what a face of despair, he cried
out! "My principles have poisoned my friend; my extravagance has beggared my boy! my unkindness has murdered
my wife!-And is there another hell? Oh! thou blasphemed,
yet indulgent LORD GOD! Hell itself is a refuge, if it hide
me from thy frown!" Soon after, his understanding failed.
His terrified imagination uttered horr*s not to be repeated,
or ever forgotten. And ere the sun (which, I hope, has seen
few like him) arose, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, accomplished, and most wretched Altamont, expired!
If this is a man of pleasure, what is a man of pain? How
quick, how total, is the transit of such persons! In what a dismal gloom they set for ever! How short, alas! the day of
their rejoicing!-For a moment ti ey glitter-they dazzle!
In a moment, where are they? Oblivion covers their memories.  Ah! would it did! Infamy snatches them from oblivion. In the long living annals of infamy their triumphs are
reoorded:  Thy sufferings, poor Altamont! still bleed in the,
bosom of the heart-stricken friend-for Altainont had a  C(hap. 7.                Dzalogues.                      1Ai

might have been the dawn of an immortal day. Ilis name
might have bee:n gloriously enrolled in the records of eternity.
Hiis mnemory might have left a sweet fragrance behind-it,
grateful to the surviving friend, salutary to the succeeding
generation.  With whlat capacity was he endowed! with what
advantages, for being greatly good! But with the talents of an
angel, a man may be a fool.  If he judges amiss in the supreme point, judging right in all else, but aggravates his folly; as it shows him wrong, though blessed with the best capacity of being right.                         bR. YOtTNG.
CHAPTER  VII.
DIALOGUES.
SECTION  I.
DEMOQRITUS AND HERACLITMS.*
The vices and follies of mLen should excite cornpas;ion rather
than ridicule.
Democritus. I find it impossible to reconcile myself to a
melancholy philosophy.
Heraclitus. And I am equally unable to approve of that vain
philosophy, which teaches men to despise and ridicule one
another.  To a wise and feeling mind, the world appears in
a wretched and painful light.
Dem. Thou art too much affected with the state of things;
and this is a source of misery to thee.
Her. And I think thou art too little moved by it. Thy
mirth and ridicule bespeak the buffoon, rather than the philosopher. Does it not excite thy compassion, to see mankind
so frail, so blind, so far departed from the rules of virtue?
Dem. I am excited to laughter, when I see so much impertinence and folly.
Her. And yet, after all, they, who are the objects of thy
ridicule, include, not only mankind in general, but the persons
with whom thou livest, thy friends, thy family, nay even
thyself.
* Democritus and Heraclitus were two ancient philosophr., the fo.r
rmer of whom laughed, and the latter wept, at the errors and follies of
mankind,12                   The English Reacer.         Part 1.
pem. I care very little for all the silly persons I meet
with; and think I am justifiable in diverting myself with their
folly.
Her. If they are weak and foolish, it marks neither wisdom
nor humanity, to insult rather than pity them.  But is it certain, that thou art not as extravagant as they are?
Dem. I presume that I am not; since, in every point, my
sentiments are the very reverse of theirs.
IIer. There are follies of different kinds. By constantly
amusing thyself with the errors and misconduct of others,
thou mayst render thyself equally ridiculous and culpable.
Dem. Thou art at liberty to indulge such sentiments; and
to weep over me too, if thou hast any tears to spare. For my
piart, I cannot refrain from pleasing myself with the levities
and ill conduct of the wor~ld about me.  Are not all men fool
ish, or irregular in their lives?
Her. Alas! there is btut too much reason to believe, they
are so: and on this ground, I pity and deplore their condition.
We agree in this point, that men do not conduct themselves
according to reasonable and just principles: but I, who do
not suffer myself to act as they do, must yet regard the
dictates of my understanding and feelings, which compel me
to love them; and that love fills me with compassion for
their mistakes and irregularities. Canst thou condemn me
for pitying my own species, my brethren, persons born in the
same condition of life, and destined to the same hopes and
privileges? If thou shouldst enter a hospital, where sick and
-wounded persons reside, would their wounds and distresses
excite thy mirth? And yet, the evils of the body bear no
comparison with those of the mind.  Thou wouldst certainly
blush at thy barbarity, if thou hadst been so unfeeling as to
laugh at or despise a poor miserable being, who had lost one
of his legs: and yet thou art so destitute of humanity, as to
ridicule those, who appear to be deprived of the noble powers of the understanding, by the little regard which they pay
to its dictates.
Dem. He who has lost a leg is to be pitied, because the loss
is not to be imputed to himself: but he who rejects the dictates of reason and conscience, voluntarily deprives himself
of their aid. The loss originates in his own foily.
Her. Ah! so much the more is he to be pitied! A. furious
maniac, WYho should pluck out his own eyes, would deserve
more c-ompassion than an ordinary blind man.
Dsm. Come, let us accommodate the business. Tbere ishchap. 7.              l)ialogues.                     113
something to be said on each side of the question. There is
every where reason for laughing, and reason for weeping.
The world is ridiculous, and I laugh at it: it is deplorable,
and thou lamentest over it. Every person views it in his own
way, and according to his own temper.  One point is unquestionable, that mankind are preposterous: to think right,
and to act well, we must think and act differently from them.
To submit to the authority, and follow the example of the
greater part of men, would render us foolish and miserable.
tIer. All this is, indeed, true; but then, thou hast no real
love or feeling for thy species. The calamities of mankind
excite thy mirth: and this proves that thou hast no regard for
men, nor any true respect for the virtues which they have,unhappily abandoned.           Fenelon, A-rchbishop of Cambray.
SECTION II.
DIONYSIUS, PYTHIAS, AND DAMON.
Genuine virtue commands respect, even from the bad.
Dionysius. AMAZING! What do I see? It is Pythias just arrived.-It is indeed Pythias. I did not think it possible. He
is come to die, and to redeem his friend!
Pythias. Yes, it is Pythias.  I left the place of my confinement, with no other views, than to pay to heaven the vows I
had made; to settle my family concerns according to the rules
of justice; and to bid adieu to my children, that I might die
tranquil and satisfied.
Dio. But why dost thou return? Hast thou no fear of death?
Is it not the character of a madman, to seek it thus voluntarily?
Py. I return to suffer, though I have not deserved death.
Every principle of honour and goodness, forbids me to allow
my friend to die for me.
Dio. Dost thou, then, love him better th'an thyself?
Py. No; I love him as myself. But I am persuaded that
I ought to suffer death, rather than my friend; since it was
Pythias whom thou hadst decreed to die.  It were not just
that Danmon should suffer, to deliver me from the death which
was designed, not for him, but for me only.
Dio. But thou supposest, that it is as unjust to inflict death
upon thee, as upon thy friend.
Py. Very true; we are both perfectly innocent; and it is
equally,:njust to make either of us suffer.
Dio. Why dost thou then assert, that it were injustice to
put him to death, instead of thee?
K 2Py. It is unjust, in the same degree, to inflict death either
on Damon or on myself; but Pythias were highly culpable to
let Damon suffer that death, which the tyrant had prepared
for Pytlias only.
Dio. Dost thou then return hither, on the day appointed, with
no other view, than to save the life ofa friend, by losing thy own?
Py. I return, in regard to thee, to suffer an act of injustice
which it is common for tyrants to inflict; and, with respect
to Damon, to perform  my duty, by rescuing him  from  the
danger he incurred by his generosity to me.
Dio. And now, Damon, let me address myself to thee.
Didst thou not really fear, that Pythias would never return;
and that thou wouldst be. put to death on his account?
Da. I was but too well assured, that Pythias would punctuallyv return; arnd that he would be more solicitous to keep
his promise, than to preserve his life.  Would to heaven, that
nis relations and friends had forcibly detained him! He would
then have lived for the comfort and benefit of good men;
and I should have the satisfaction of dying for him!
Dio. What!  Does life displease thee?
D)a. Yes; it displeases me when I see and feel the power
of a tyranit.
Dio. It is well! Thoui shalt see him  no more.  I will order thee to be put to death immediately.
P'y. Pardon the feelings of a man who smypathizes with
his dying firiend.  But remember it was Pythias who was devoted by thee to destruction.  I come to submit to it, that I
may redeem my friend.  Do not refuse me this consolation in
my last hour.
Di.. I cannot endure men, who despise death, and set my
power at defiance.
Da. TI'hou canst not, then, endure virtue.
Dio. No: I cannot endure that proud, disdainful virtue,'
which contemns life; which dreads no punishment; and
which is insensible to the charms of riches and pleasure.
Da. Thou seest, however, that it is a virtue, which is not
insensible to the dictates of honour, justice, and firiendship.
Dio. Guards, take Pythias to execution.  We shall see
whether D)amon wvill continue to despise my authority.
Da. Pythias, by returning to submit himself to thy pleasure, has'merited his life, and deserved thy flavour; but I
have excited thy indignation, by resigning myself to thy poweI, in order to save him; be satisfied, then, witlh this sacriE.c, aznd put Umre to deatL

Py. Hold, Dionysius! remember, it was Pythias alone who
offended thee: Damon could not
Dio. Alas! what do I see and hear! iwhere am I? How
miserable; and how worthy to be so! I have hitherto known
nothing of true virtue.  I have spent my life in darkness and
error.  All my power and honours are insufficient to produce
love.  I cannot boast of having acquired a single friend, in
the course of a reign of thirty years.  And vet these two
persons, in a private condition, love one another tenderly, unreservedly confide in each other, are mutually happy, and
ready to die for each other's preservation.
Py. How couldst thou, who hast never loved any person,
expect to have friends? If thou hadst loved and respected
men, thou wouldst have secured their love and respect.'rhou
hast feared mankind; and they fear thee; they detest thee.
Dio. Damon, Pythias, conidescend to admit me as a third
friend, in a connexion so perfect. I give you your lives; and
I will load you wi-th riches.
Da. We have no desire to be enriched by thee; and, in
regard to thy friendship, we cannot accept or enjoy it, till
thou become good and just.  Without these qualities, thou
canst be connected with none but trembling slaves, and base
flatterers. To be loved and esteemed by men of free and
generous minds,;tou must be virtuous, affectionate, disinterested, beneficent; and know how to live in a sort of equality
with those who share and deserve thy friendship.
Fenelon, drchbishop of Cambray.
SECTION  III.
LOCKE AND B,AYLE.
Christianity defended against the cavils of scepticism.
Bayle. YES, we both were philosophers; but my philosophy
was the deepest. You dogmatized; I doubted.
Locke. Do you make doubting a proof of depth in philbsophy? It may be a good beginning of it; but it is;: bad end. K
Bayle. No:-the more profound our searches are into the
nature of things, the more uncertainty we shall find; and the
most subtle minds see objections and difficulties in every systen, which are overlooked or undiscoverable by orditnary understandings.
Locke. It would be better then to be no philosopher, and to
continue in the, vular herd of mankrind, thai; one ma-y have ttlli6                 TThe English Reader.            Part 1,
convenience of thinking that one knows something. I find
that the eyes which nature has given me, see many things
very clearly, though some are out of their reach, or discerned
but dimly. What opinion ought I to have of a physician, who
should offer me an eye-water, the use of which would at first
so sharpen my sight, as to carry it farther than ordinary vision; but would in the end put them out? Your philosophy
is to the eyes of the mind, what I have supposed the doctor's
nostrum to be to those of the body. It actually brought your
own excellent understanding, which was by nature quicksighted, and rendered more so by art and a subtilty of logic
peculiar to yourself--it brought, I say, your very acute understanding to see nothing clearly; and enveloped all the
great truths of reason and religion in mists of doubt.
Bayle. I own it did;-but your comparison is not just. I
did not see well, before I used my philosophic eye-water: I
only supposed I saw well; but I was in an error, with all the
rest of mankind. The blindness was real, the perceptions
were imaginary. I cured myself first of those false imaginations, and then I laudably endeavo-ured to cure other men.
Locke. A great cure indeed!-and do not you think that, irt
return for the service you did them, they ought to erect you
a statue?
Bayle. Yes; it is good for human nature to know its own
weakness.  When we arrogantly presume on a strength we
have not, we are always in great danger of hurting ourselves
or at least of deserving ridicule and contempt, by vain ane
idle efforts.
Locke. I agree with you, that human nature should kno%v
its own weakness; but it should also feel its strength, and try
to improve it.  This was my employment as a philosopher.
I endeavoured to discover the real powers of the mind, to see
what it could do, and what it could not; to restrain it from
efforts beyond its ability; but to teach it how to advance as
far as the faculties given to it by nature, with the utmost exertion and most proper culture of them, would allow it to go.
In the vast ocean of philosophy, I had the line and the plummet alwavs in my hands.  Many of its depths I found myself
unable to fathom; hut, by caution in sounding. and the careful observations I made in the course of my voyage, I fount
out some truths of so mnch use to mankind, that they azknowledge me to have been their benefactor.
Bayle. Their igriorance makes them think so. Some other
philosopher will come hereaRer, and show those truths to bechap. 7.                Dialogu cs.                    117
falsehoods.  He will pretend to discover other truths of equal
importance.  A later sage will arise, perhaps among men now
barbarous and unlearned, whose sagacious discoveries will discredit the opinions of his admired predecessor.  In philosophy, as in nature, all changes its form, and one thing exists by
tile destruction of another.
Locke. Opinions taken up without a patient investigation,
depending on terms not accurately defined, and principles
begged without prooI, like theories to explain the phbanomena
of nature, built on suppositions instead of experiments, must
perpetually change and destrov one another.  But some opinions there are, even in matters not obvious to the common
sense of mankind, which the mind has received on such rational grounds of assent, that they are as immoveable as the
pillars of heaven; or (to speak philosophically) as the great
laws of Nature, by which, under God, the universe is sustained. Can you seriously think, that, because the hypothesis
of your countryman Descartes, which was nothing but an ingenious, well-imagined romance, has been lately exploded, the
system of Newton, which is built on experiments and geometry, the two most certain methods of discovering truth, will
ever fail; or that, because the whims of fanatics and the
divinity of the schoolmen, cannot now be supported, the
doctrines of that religion, which I, the declared enemy of all
enthusiasm and false reasoning, firmly believed and maintained, will ever be shaken?
Bayle. If you had asked Descartes, while he was in the
height of his vogue, whether his system would ever be confilted by any other philosophers, as that of Aristotle had been
by his, what answer do you suppose he would have returned?
Locke. Come, come, you yourself know the difference between the foundations on which the credit of those systems,
and that of Newton is placed.   Your scepticism  is more
affected than real.  You found it a shorter way to a great reputation, (the only wish of your heart,) to object, than to defend; to pull down, than to set up.  And youlr t:leCnts were
admirable for that kind of work.  Then your huddling together in a Critical Dictionary, a pleasant tale, or obscene
jest, and a grave argument against the Christian religion, a
witty confutation of some absurd author, and an artful sophism
to impeach some respectable truth, was particularly cominodiouls to all our young smarts and smalterers in fiee-thinking.  But what mischief hlave you not done to human society?

than to give greater variety to the modulation.*  Notwithstanding this diversity of practice, there ar* certainly proper boundaries, within whicb thisemphasis must be restrained, in order to make it meet the approbation of
sound judgment aud correct taste. It will doubtless have different degrees
of exertion, according to the greater or less degrees of importance of the
words upon which it operates; and there may be very properly some variety
in the use of it: but its applicationis not arbitrary, dependitlg on the ca
price of readers.
As emphasis often falls on words in different parts of the same sentence,
so it is frequently required to be continued with a little variation, on two,
and sometimes more words together.  The following sentences exemplify
both the parts of this position: " If you seek to make one rich, study not
to increase his stores,, but to diminish his desires." ", The Alexican figures,
or picture writing, represent things not words: they exliibit images to te
eye, not ideas to the understanding."
Some sentences are so full and comprehensive, that almost every word
is emrhatical: as, " Ye hills and dales, ye rivers, woods, and plains!" or,
as thatpathetic expostulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel, "Why will ye
die!"
Eniphasis, besides its other offices, is the. great regulator of quantifty.
Though the quantity of our syllables is fixed, in words seperlately pronou0 -
Ced, yet it is mutable, when these words are arranged in sentences9 the
long being changed into short, the short into long, according to the itlborlance of.the word with regard to meaning.  Emphasis atso, in partIcular
cases, alters the seat of the accent.  This is demonstrable from the following examples  "He shall increase, but I shall decrease."  " There is a
difference between giving and forgiving.". "In this species of composition,
plausibility is'much more essential than probability."'  In these examples,
the emphasis requires the accent to be placed on syllables, to which it
does not commonly belbng.
In order to acquire the proper management of the emphasis, the great
rule to be given, is, that the reader study to attain ajust conception of the
force and spirit of the sentimnents which lie is to pronotunce.: For to lay
the emphasig with exact propriety, is a constant exercise of good sense
tand attention.  It is far from being an inconsiderable attainment. It is
one of the most decisive trials of a true and just taste; hLnd must arise from
feeling delicately oum'selves; and from judging accurai'ely  of what is fittest
to strike the feelings of others.
There is oiie error, against which it is particularly proper to cautioii the
learner; namely, that of multiplying  ernphatical words tou much; and
using the emphasis indiscrimipately.  It is only by a prudent reserve and
distinction in the use of them, that we can give theinany weight.  If they
recur too often; if a reader attempts to render every thing he expresses of
high importance, by a multitude of strong empha.sis, we soon learn to pay
iittle regard to them. To criowd every sentence with emphatical words,
is like crowding all the pages of a book with Italic characters; which, as
to the effect, is.j ustthe same as to use no such distinctions at all.
* By modulation is meant that pleasing-varlety of voice, which is perceived in uttering
a sentence, and which, in its nature, is perfectlv dtistinct from elmphasis, and th. tones of
emotion and passion. The young readershoild be careful io lender his modulationi corsect and easy; and, for this purpose, sfould foni it upon the model of the most judicious

shake those foundations, on which the whole moral world,
and the great fabric of social happiness, entirely rest.  How
could you, as a philosopher, in the sober hours of reflection,
answer fbr this to your conscience, even supposing you had
doubt$ of the truth of a system, which gives to virtue its
sweetest hopes, to i mpenitent vice its greatest fears, and to
true peaitcnce its best consolations; which restrains even the
least approatches to guilt, and yet makes those allowances for
the infirmities of our nature, which the Stoic pride denied to
it, but which its real imperfection, and the goodness of its
infinitely benevolent Creator, so evidently require?
Bayle. The mi;d is free; and it loves to exert its freedom.
Any restraint upon it is a violence done to its nature, and a
tyranny, against which it has a right to rebel.
Locke. The mind, though free, has a governor within itself, which may and ought to limit the exercise of its freedom.
That governor is reason.
Bayle. Yes:-but reason, like other governors, has a policy
more dependent upon uncertain caprice, than upon any fixed
laws. And if that reason, which rules my mind or yours, has
happened to set up a favourite notion, it not only submits
implicitly to it, but desires that -the same respect should be
paid to it by all the rest of mankind.  Now I hold that any
man may lawfully oppose this desire in another; and that if
he is wise, he will use his utmost endeavours to check it in
himself.
Locke. Is there not also a weakness of a contrary nature to
this you are now ridiculing? Do we not often take a pleasure
in showing*our own power, and gratifying our own pride, by
degrading the notions set up by other men, and generally respected?
Bayle. I believe we do; and by this means it often happens,
that, if one man builds and consecrates a temple to folly
another pulls it down.
Locke. Do you think it beneficial to human society, to have
all temples pulled down?
Bayle. i cannot say that I do.
Locke. Yet I find not in your writinlgs any mark of distiriction, to show us which you mean to save.
Bayle. A true philosopher, like an impartial historian, must
be of no sect.
Locke. is there no,medium between the blind zeal of a
sectary, and a total indifference to all religiori?
Bayl. With regard to morality, I was not indifferent.Chap.'.                 Dialogues.;i19
Locke. How could you then be indifferent with regard to
the sanctions religion gives to morality? How could you publish what tends so directly and apparently to weaken in mankind the belief of those sanctions? Was not this sacrificing
the great interests of virtue to the little motives of vanity?
Bayle. A man may act indiscreetly, but he cannot do wrong,
by declaring that, which, on a full discussion of the question,
he sincerely thinks to be true.
Locke. An enthusiast, who advances doctrines prejudicial
to society, or opposes any that are useful to it, has the strength
of opinion, apd the heat of a disturbed imagination, to plead
in alleviation of his fault. But your cool head and sound
judgment, scan have no such excuse.  I know very well there
are passages in all your works, and those not few, where you
talk like a rigid moralist. I have also heard that your character was irreproachably good. But when, in the most laboured
parts of your writings, you sap the surest foundations of all
moral duties; what avails it that in others, or in the conduct
of your life, you appeared to respect them? How many, who
have stronger passions than you had, and are desirous to get
rid of the curb that restrains them, will lay hold of your
scepticism, to set themselves loose from all obligations of virtie! What a misfortune is it to have made such a use of such
talents! It would have been better or you and for mankind,
if you had been one of the dullest of Dutch theologians, or
the most credulous monk in a Portuguese convent. The riches of the mind, like those of fortune, may be employed so
perversely, as to become a nuisance and pest, instead of art
ornament and support, to society.
lBayle. You are very severe upon me.-But*do you count
it no merit, no service to mankind, to deliver them from the
frauds and fetters of priestcraft, from the deliriums of fanaticism, and from the terrors and follies of superstition? Consider how much mischief these have done to the world!
Even in the last age, what massacres, what civil wars, what
convulsions of government, what confusion in society, did
they produce! Nay, in that we both lived in, though much
more enlightened than the former, did I not see them occasion a violent persecution in my own cour,tr.y  and can you
blame me for striking at the root of these evils?
Locke. The root of these evils, you well know, was false
religion: but you struck at the true. Heaven and hell are not
more different, than the system of faith I defended, and that
which produced the horrors of which you speak.  Why120                The English Reader.              Part.
would you so fallaciously confound them together in some of
your writings, that it requires much more judgment, and a
more diligent attention, than ordinary readers have, to separate them again, and to make the proper distinctions? This,
indeed,' is the great art of the most celebrated free-thinkers.
They recommend themselves to warm and ingenuous minds,
by lively strokes of wit, and by arguments really strong,
against superstition, enthusiasm, and priestcraft.  But, at the
same time, they insidiously throw the colours of these upon
the fair face of true religion; and dress her out in their garb,
with a malignant intention to render her odious or despicable,
to those who have not penetration enough to discern the
impious fraud. Some of them may have thus deceived themselves, as well as others. Yet it is certain, no book that ever
was written by the most acute of these gentlemen, is so repugnant to priestcraft, to spiritual tyranny, to all absurd su,
perstitions, to all that can tend to disturb or injure society, as
ithat gospel they so much affect to despise.
Bayle. AI,nkind are so made, that, when they have been
over-heated, they cannot be brought to a proper temper again,
till they-have been over-cooled. My scepticism might be n,cessary, to abate the fever and phrenzy of false religion.
Locke. A wise prescription, indeed, to bring on a paralytical state of the mind, (for such a scepticism as yours is a
palsy, which deprives the mind of all vigouir, and deadens its
natural and vital powers,) in order to take off a fever, which
temperance, and the milk of the evangelical doctrines, would
probably cure!
Bayle. I acknowledge that those medicines have a great
power. But few doctors apply them untainted with the mixture of some harsher drugs, or some unsafe and ridiculous
nostrums of their own.
Locke, Visat you now say is too true.--God has given us
a most excellent physic for the soul, in all its diseases; but
bad and interested physicians, or ignorant and conceited
quacks, administer it so iM to the rest of mankind, that much
of the benefit of it is unhappily lost.  LORID LYTrTELTON.CHAP. VIII.

SECTION I.
CIcERo against VERRES.,
THE time is come, Fathers, when that which h s long been
wished for, towards allaying the envvy your order has been
subject to, and removing the imputations against trials, is effectually put in your power.  An opinion has long prevailed,
not only here at home, but likewise in foreign countries, botlh
dangerous to you, and pernicious to the state,-that, in prosecutions, men of wealth are always safe, however clearly'convicted.  There is now to be broug,:t upon his trial before you,
to the confusion, I hope, of the propagators of this slanderous
imputation,. one whose life and actions condemn him in the
opinion of all impartial persons; but who, according to his own
reckoning and declared dependence upon his riches, is already
acquitted; I mean Caius Verres.  I defiiand justice -of you,
Fathers, upon the robber of the public treasury, the oppressor
of Asia AMinor and Pamphylia, the invader of the rights and
privileges of Romans, the scourge and curse of Sicily.  If
that sentence is passed upon him which his crimes deserve,
your -authority, Fathers, will be venerable and sacred in the
eyes of the- public: but if his great riches should bias you in
his favour,- I shall still gain one point,'-to malke it apparent to
all the world, that what was wanting in this case, was not a
criminal nor a prosecutor, but justice and adequate punishment.
To pass over the shameful irregularities of his youth, what
does his quemstorship, the first ptublic employment he held,
what does it exhibit, but one continued scene of vlllanies?
Cneius Carbo, plundered of the public money by nhis own
treasurer, a consul stripped and betrayed, art army deserted
and reduced to want, a province robbed,' the civil and r/e:i
gious rights of a people -violated.  The employment he-held
in Asia Minor and Pamphylia, what did it produce but the ruin
of those countries? in which houses, cities, and temples, were
robbed by him.  What was his conduct in his pratorship here
at home? Let the phindered temples, and public work~ neglected, that he might embezzle the money intenied for carrymg them on, bear witness. How did he discharge the ofdfee of a judge? Let those who -suffered by his injustice an122  -~;         The English Reader.             Part 1.
swer.  But tiis pratorship in Sicily crowns all his, works of
wickedness, and finishes a lasting monument to his infamy.
The mischiefs done by him in that unhappy country, during
the three years of his iniquitous administration, are such, that
many years, under the wisest and best of praetors, will not be
sufficient to restore things to the condition in which he found
them: for it is notorious, that, during the time of his tyranny,
the Sicilians neither enjoyed the protection, of their own original laws; of the regulations made for their benefit by the
Roman senate, upon their coming under the protection of the
commonwealth; nor of the natural and unalienable rights of
men. Jlis nod has decided all causes in Sicily for-these three
years. And Iiis decisions have broken all iaw, all precedent,
all right. The sums he has, by-arbitrary taxes and unheard-of
nDpositions, extorted frorn the induistrious poor, are not to be
computed.  The most faithful allies of the commonwealth
have been treated as enemies.  Roman citizens have, like
slares, been put to deiath with tortures.  The most atrocious
crimiAal, ~)or money, have been exempted from the deserved
punishments; and men of the most unexceptionable characters, condemned and banished unheard. The harbours, though
sufficiently fortified, and the gates of strong towns, have been
oFened to pirates and ravagers. The soldiery and sailors, belonging to a province under the protection of the commonwealth, have been starved to death; whole fleets, to the greatdetriment of the province, siffered to perish. The ancient monuments of either Sicilian or Roman greatness, the statues of
heroes and princes, hlave been carried off; arid the temples
stripped of the images.-Having, by his iniquitou' tentences.,
filled'the prisons with the:most industrious and deserving of
the people, he then proceeded to order nu'mbers of Roman
citizens to be strangled in the gaols:-so that the exclamation,
" I am a citizen of Rome!" which. has often, in the most distant regions, and among the most barbarous people, been a
protection, was of no service to them; but, on the contrary;
brought a speedier and a more sev're punishment upon themI ask now, Verres, what thou hast to advance against this
charge? Wilt thou pretend to deny it? Wilt thou pretend,
that any thing fplse, that even any thing aggravated, is alleged
against thee? Had any prince, or any state, committed'
the same outrage against the privilege of Reman citizens,
snhould we not think we had sufficient ground for deimanding
tatisfacion?'What punishment ought, then, to be inflicted
upon a tyrannical anid Wicked pr3etor. who dared, at no greatC'hap. 8.             Public Speeches.                  123
er distance than Sicily, within sight of the Italian coast, to
put to the infamous death ofLcrucifixion, that unfortunate and
innocent citizen, Publius Gavius Cosanus, only for his having
asserted his'privilege of citizenship, and declared his intention,
of appealing to the justice of his country, against the cruel
oppressor, who had unjustly confined him in prison at Syracuse, whence lie had just made his escape? The unhappy
man,. arrested as he was going to embark for his native coun-.
try, is brought before the wicked pramtor.  With eyes darting
fury, and a countenance distorted with cruelty, he orders the
helpless victim of his rage to be stripped, and rods to be
brought: accusing him, but without the least shadow oT evidence, or even of suspicion, of having come to Sicily as a spy.
at was in vain that the unllappy man cried out, " I am a Roman citizen: I have served under Lucius Pretius, wNho is now
at Panormus, and wil attest my innocence.'  - The blood-thirsty Martor, deaf to all he could urge in his own defence, ordered the infamous punishment to be iriflicted. Thus, fathers,
was an innocent Roman'citizen publicly,mangled with. scourging; whilst the only words he uttered, amidst his cruel sufferings, were, "I am  a Roman citizen!" With these he
hoped to defend himself from violence and infamy.  But of
so little service was this privilege to him, that, while he was
thus asserting his citizenship, the order was given for his exe;
cution,-for his execution upon the cross!
O liberty!-O sound once. delightful to every Roman ear!0 sacred privilege of Roman citizenship!-once sacred!now trampled upon!-But what then.! Is it come to this?
Shall an inferior magistrate, a governor, who holds his. whole
power,of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within
sight of Italy, bind, scourge, torture with fire and red hot
plates of iron, and at last put to the infamous death of the
cross, a Roman -citizer? Shall neither the cries of innocence
expiring in agony, nor the tears of pitying spectators, nor the
majesty of the Roman commonwealth, nor the fear of the
justice of his country, restrain the licentious and wanton cruelty of a monster, who, in confidence of hisi riches, strikes at
the root of liberty, and sets mankind at defiance?
I conclude with expressing my hopes, thitO our wisdom
and justice, Fathers, will not,' /suffering thocious and
unexampled insolence of Caius Verres to escap uedue punishment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total subver-sion of authority, and the introduction of general anarchy and
onfuision.                             ciCE-Ro's  OUATIONS.:SECTION II.
Speech of ADHERBAL to the Romzan Senate, imploring their pr),
tection against JvtJUGRTIA.
FATHERS!
IT is known to you, that king Micipsa, my father, on his
death-bed, left in charge to Jugurtha, his adopted son, conjunctly with my unfortunate brother Hiempsal and myself,- the
children of his own body, the administration of the kingdom
of Numidia, directing us to consider the senate and people of'
Rome as proprietors of it. He charged us td use our best endeavou.s to be serviceable to the Roman commonwealth; as-.
suring us, that your protection would prove a defence against
all.enemies; and would be instead of armies, fortifications,
and treasures.
While my brother and I were thinking of nothing but how
to regulate ourselves according to the directions of our:deceased father--Jugurtha-the most infamous of mankind!breaking through all ties of gratitude and of common humanity, and trampling on the authority of the Roman commonwealth, procured the murder of my unfortunate brother;
and has driven me from.my throne and native country, though
he knows I inherit, from my grandfather Massinissa, and my
father Micipsa, the friendship and alliance of the Romans.
For a prince to be reduced, by villany, to my distressful circumstances, is calamity enough; but my misfortunes are
heightened by the consideration-that I find myself obliged
to solicit-your assistance, fathers, for the services done you
by' my ancestors, not for any I have been able to reider you
in my own person. Jugulrtha has put it out of my power to
deserve any thing at your hands; and has forced me" to be
burdensome, before I could be useful to you. And yet, if I
had no plea, but my undeserved misery--a once powerful
prince, the descendant of a race of ilfustrious monarchs, now,
without any fault of my-own, destitute of every support, and
rcduced to the necessity of begging foreign assistance, against
an enemy w4ho has seized my throne- and my kingdom--if
my unequalled distresses were all I had to plead-it would
become the greatness of the Roman commonwealth, to protect the injured, and to check the triumph of daring wickedness over helpless innocence. But, to provoke your resentment
to the utmost, Jugurtha has driven me from the very dominions, which the senate and people of Rome gave to my ancestors;'aid, from which,_my grandfther, and my father, under:your umbrage, expelled Syphlax and the Carthaginians.'hus,._yu umb                  11'Chap. 8.

fathers, your kindness to our family is defeated; and Jugurtha, in injuring me, throws contempt upon you.
O wretched prince! Oh cruel reverse of fortune! Oh fitther-Micipsa!' is this the consequence of thy generosity; that
he, whom thy goodness raised to an equality with thy own
children, should be the murderer of thy children,? Must, then,
the royal house of Numidia always be a scene of havoc and
blood? While Carthage remained, we suffered, as was to be
expected, all sorts of hardships from their hostile, attacks; our
enemy near; our only powerful ally, the Roman comrmonwealth, at a distance. When that scourge of Africa was no
more, we congratulated ourselves on the prospect of established peace. But, instead of peace, behold the kingdofm of Numidia drenched with royal blood  and the onlygsrvivingson of
its late king, flying from an adopted murderer, and seeking
that safety in fore-ign parts, which he cannot command in his
own kingdom.
Whither-Oh! whither shall I fly? If I return to the royal
palace of my ancestors, my father's throne is seized by the
murderer of my brother. What can I there expect, but that
Jugurtha should hasten to imbrue, in my blood, those hands
which are now reeking with my brother's? If I were to fly
for refuge, or for assistance to any other court, from'what
prince can I hope for protection, if the-Roman commonwealth
give me up? From my own.family or friends I have no expectations. M yroyal father is no more. He i. beyond the
reach of violence, and- out of hearing of the complaints of his
unhappy son. -  ere my brother alive, our mutual sympathy
would 1b some alleviation. But he is hurried out of life, in
his early youth, by the very hand which should have been the
last to -injure any of the royal family of Numidia.  The
bloody Jugurtha has butchered all 4ilom he suspected to be
in my interest. Some have been destroyed by the lingering
torment of the cross. Others have been given a prey to wild
beasts; and their anguish made the sport?of men more cruel
than wild beasts. If there be arly yet alive, they are shut up
in dungeons, there to drag out a life more intolerable than
death itself.
Look down, illustrious senators of Rome! from that height
of power, to which you are raised, on the.unexampled distresses of-a prince, who is, by the cruelty of a wicked intruder, become an' outcast from all mankind.!04t a0 the

a:5butchered the son and relations of a king, who gave him
power to sit 1on the same throne with his own sons.-I have
been informed, that he labours by his emissaries to prevent
your determining any thing against him in his absence; pretending that I magnify my distress, aud might, for him, have
staid in peace in my own kingdom.  But, if ever the time
comes, when the due vengeance from above shall overtake
him, he will then dissemble as I do. Then he;, who now,
hardened in wickedness, triumphs over those whom his violence has laid low, will, in his turn, feel distress, and suffer for
his impious ingratitude to my father, and his blood-thirsty
cruelty to my brother.
Oh murdered, butchered brother! Oh dearest to my heart--
now gone- for ever from my sight!--but why should I lament
his deathb? He is, indeed, deprived of the blessed light of
heaven, of life, and kingdom, at once, by the very person who
ought to have been the first to hazard his own life, in defence
of any one of Micipsa's family.  But, as things are, my brother is not so much deprived of these comforts, as delivered
from terror, from flight, from exile, and the endless train of
miseries which render life to me a burden. -He:lies full low,
gored with wounds, -and festering in his own' blood.  But he
lies in peace. He- feels none of the miseries-which rend my
soul with agony and distraction, while I am set up a spectacle
to all mankind, of the uncertainty of human affairs. So far
from having it in my power to punish his murderer, I am not
master of the means of securing'my own life.  So far from
being in a condition to defend my kingdom from thlitviolence
of the usurper, I am obliged to apply for foreign protection
for my own person.

country; by your own virtues; by the majesty of the Roman

Why should- it be thought a thing incredible with you, that
God should raise the dead? I verily thought with myself, that,
I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of

Tones.
ToNES are different both from emphasis and pauses; coneisting in the
notes or variations of sound which we employ, in the expression of our
sentiments.: Emphasis affects particular words and phrases, with a degree
of tone or inflexion of voice; but tones, peculiarly so called, affect sentences, paragraphs, and sometimes even the whole of a discourse.
To show the use and necessity of tones, we need only observe, that the
mind, in communicating its ideas, is in a constant state of activity, emotion,
or agitatio.n, from the different effects which those ideas produce'in the
speaker. Now the end of such communication being, not merely to lay
open the ideas, but also the different feelings which they excite in him who
utters them, there must be other signs than words, to manifest those feelings; as words uttered in a monotonous manner,can-represent onely a similar
state of mind, perfectly free from all activity and emiotion. As the communication of these internal feelings was of much more consequence in
our social intercourse, than the mere conveyance of ideas, the Author of
our being did not, as in that conveyance, leave the invention of the language of emotion to man; but impressed it himself upon our nature, in
the same manner as he has donie with regard to the rest of the animal
world; all of which express their various feelings, by various tones. Oulrs,
indeed, from the superior rank that we hold, are in a high degree more
comprehensive; as there is not an act of-the mind, an exeertion of the fan
cy, or an emotion of the heart, which has not its peculiar tone, or note of
the voice, by which it is to be expressed; and which is suited exactly to
the degree of internal feeling. It is chiefly in the proper use ofthese tones,
that the life, spirit, beauty, and harmony of delivery consist.
The limits of this Introduction do not admit of examples, to illustrate
the variety of tones belonging to the different passions and emotions. We
shall, however, select one, which is extracted from the beautifil lamentation of David over Saul and Jonathan, and which will, in some degree,
elucidate what has been said on this subject. " The beauty of Israel, is
slain upon thy high places; how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath;
publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines
rejoice; lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. Ye mountains
of Cilboa, let there be no dewrnor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings,;
for.there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,,
as though he had not been anointed with oil."  The firstof these divisions
expresses sorrow and lamentation: therefore the note is low. The next
contains a spirited command; and should be pronounced muol higher.
The other sentence, in which he makes a. pathetic address to the mountainis where his friends had been slain, must be expressed in a note quite different from.the two former;' not so low as the first, nor so high as the second, in a manly, firm, and yet plaintive tone.
The correct and natural language of the emotions is not so difficult to
be, attained, as most'readers seem to imagine. If we enter into the spirit
of the author's sentiments, as well as into the meaning of his wordsI we
shall not fail to deliver the words in properly varied tones. For there are
few people, who speak English without a provincial note, that have not an
accurate use of tones, when they utter their sentiments in earnest discourse.
A.Td the reason thait they have not the same use of them, in readingaloud
the sentimems of others, may be traced to the very defective and erroneous metiod, inr which the art of reading is taught; whereby all the variINtIRODUiCTIOI.

at Jerusalem, and through all the coasts of Judea, and then
to the Gentiles, that they should repent, and turn to God, and
do works meet for repentance.  For these, causes, the Jews::. caught me in the temple; and went about to killme. Having,
however, obtained help from God, I continue to this day,
witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things
than those which the prophets and Moses declared should
come; that Christ should suffer; that he would be the first
who should rise from the dead; and that he would show light
to the people, and to the Gentiles.
And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said, with a loud
voice, " Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning hath
made thee mad," But he replied, I am not mad, most noble
Festus; but speak the words of truth and soberness.  For
the king knoweth these things, before whom I also speak
freely. I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden
fiom  him: for this thing was not done in a corner.  Kiag
Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest.  Then Agrippa said to Paul, " Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."  And Paul replied, " I would
to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day,
wvere both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these
bonds."*                                           ACTS XXVI.
SECTION  IV.
LoRD MANSFIEI,D'S speech in the House of Peers, 1770, on the
bill for preventing the delays of justice, by claimin, the Privilege of Parliament.
MIY LORDS,
WHEN I consider the irnportance of this bill to your Lord-' hips, I am not surprised it has taken up so much of your consideration.  It is a-bill, indeed, of no common magnitude;it
is no less than to take away from two thirds of the legislative
body of this great kingdom, certain privileges and immunities
of which they have been long possessed. Perhaps there is no
situation the human mind can be placed in, that is so difficult
and so trying, as when it is made a judge in its own cause.
* How happy was this great Apostle, even in the most perilous circumstances 1 Though under bonlds and oppression, his mind was free, and
raised above every'fear of mani With what dignity and composure does
he defend himself, and the noble cause he had espoused; whilst he displays
the most comrpassionate and gene~roos feelings, for those who were strangers
to the sublime religion by whic - he was aunmated!There is something Implanted in the breast of man so attached
to self, so tenacious of privileges once obtained, that in such
a situation, either to discuss with irmpartiality, or decide with
justice, has ever been held the summit of all hutnan virtue.
The bill now in question ptts your lordships in this very predicament; and I have no doubt the wisdom of your decision
will convince the world, that where self-interest and justice
are in opposite scales, the latter will ever preponderate with
your lordships.
Privileges have been granted to legislators in all ages, and
in all countries.  The practice is founded in wisdom; and,
indeed, it is peculiarly essential to the constitution of this
country, that the members of both houses should be free -in
their persons, in cases of civil suits: for there may come a
time when the safety and welfare of this whole empire, may
depend upon their attendance in parliament.  I am  far from
advising any measure that would in future endanger the state:
but the bill before your lordships has, I am confident, no
such tendency; for it expressly secures the persons of members of either house in all civil suits. This being the case, I
confess, when I see many noble lords, for whose ju&amp;c-inent I
have a very great respect, standing up to oppose a bill which
is calculated merely to facilitate the recovery of just and legal
debts, I -am astonished and amazed.  They, I doubt not, oppose the bill upon public principles: I would not wish to insinuate, that private interest had the least weight in their determination.
The bill has been frequently proposed, and as frequently
has miscarried: but it was always lost in the lower house.
Little did I think, when it had passed the commons, that it
possibly could have met with such opposition here.  Shall it
be said, that you, my lords, tile grand council of the nation,
the highest judicial and legislative body of the realm, endeavour to evade, by privilege, those very laws which you enforce
on your fellow-subjects? -Forbid it justice i--I am sure, were
the noble lords as well acquainted as I am, with but half the
difficulties and delays occasioned in the courts of justice, under pretence of privilege, they would not, nay, they could
not, oppose this bill.
I have waited with patience to hear what arguments might
be urged against this -bill; but I have waidted in vain: the
truth is, there is no argilment that can weigh against it.  The
justine and expediency of the bill are sutch as render it selfevident.  It is a proposition of th;at nature, which can neither

129be weakenedt by argument, nor entangled with sophistry.
-Mluch, indeed, has been said by somie noble lords, on the wisdom Qf our ancestors, and how differently they thought from'us. They not only decreed, that privilege should prevent
-all civil suits from proceeding during the sitting of parliament,
but likewise granted protection to- the very servants of members. I shall say nothing on the wisdom of our ancnstors; it
might perl-aps appear invidious:. that is not necessary in,the
present case.  I shall only say, that the noble lords who flatter themiselves with the weight of that reflection, should remember, that as circumstances alter, things themselves should
alter.  Formerly, it -:vas not so, fashionable either for masters
or servants to run in debt, as it is at present. Formerly, we
were not that great commercial nation we are a   ent; nor
formerly were merchants and manufactures members of parliament as at present.  The case is n-ow. very different: both
merchants and manufactures are, with great proprietvy, elected mermbers of the lower house.' Commerce having thus got
into the legislative body of the kingdom, privilege must be
done away. We all know, that the very soul and essence of,.-.trade are regular payments; and sad experience teaches us,
that there are men, who will not make their regular payments
without the compulsive power of the laws.  The law then
ought to be equally open to all. Any exemption to particular
men, or particular ranks of men, is, in a free and comamercial
country, a solecism of the grossest nature..  
But I will not, trouble your lordships with arguments for
that, which is sufficiently evident without any.- 1 shall only
say a few words to some noble lords, who foresee much -inconvenience, from the per~sons of their servants being liable to
be arrested.  One noble lord observes, That the coachman;"
of a peer may be arrested, while he is driving his master to
the House, and that, consequently, he will not be able to attend his.duty in parliament.  If this were actually to happen,
there are so many methods by which the member might still
get to the house, that I can' hardly think the noble'lord is seriouls in his objection. Another noble pecr said, That, by this
bill, rose nmi_ht lose' his most valuable and honest servants.
This I hold to be a contradiction in terms: for he can neither'be a valuable servant, nor an honest man, who gets into debt
which he is neither able nor willing to, pay, till compelled by
the law.  If my servant, by unfo&amp;reseen accidents, hgs got into debt, and I still. wish to retain him, I certa-inly woull pay
the demand.  utat upon no principle oflibei'al: Iegislatio

whatever, can my servant have a title to set his`-reditors at
defiance, while, for forty shillings only, the honest tradesman
may be torn from his family, and, locked up in a gaol., It is
monstrous injustice! I flatter myself, however, the determination of this clay will entirely put an end to all these partial
proceedings for the future, by passing into a law the bill now
under your lqrdships' consideration.
I come now to speak, upon what, indeed, I wvould have
gladly avoided, had I not been particularly pointed at, for the
part I have taken in this bill.  It has been said, by a noble
lordl on my left hand, that I likewise am running the race 6f
popularity. - If the noble lord means by popularity,. that applause bestowed by after-ages on good and virtudus actions, I
have long been struggling in that race: -to what purpose, alltrying timne can alone deternmine.   But if the lioble lord
means that musbroom popularity, which is raised without
merit, and lost without a criLme, he is much mistaken in his
opinion.  I defy the noble lord to point out a;ingle action of
my life, in which the popularity of tBe times ever had the
smallest influence on my determinations.  I than k God I have
a more permanent and steady rule for my conduct,---the dictates of my own breast.  Those who have forgone that pleasing adviser,' and given up their mind to be the slave of every
popdlar irmpulse, I sincerely pity: I pity them still more, if
their vanity leads them  to mist:a e the shoLits of a mob, for
the trumpet of fame. E- xperience might inform  them, that
many, who have been saluted with the huzzas of a crowd one
day, have received their execrations the next; and many,
who by the popularity of their times, have bee iAeld up as
spottess patriots, have, neveirtheless, appeared upoA hehiistorian's page, when truth has triumphed over delusi  ithe assassins of liberty.  Why then the noble lord can thfik I -am
ambitious of present popullarityr, that echo of folly, and sh dowv
of renown, I am at a loss to determine.  Besides, I do not
know that the bill now before your lordships will be popuiar:
it depends much upon the caprice of the day.  It may not
be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that
case, tlie present must be a  very unpopular bill.  It may not
be popular either to take away any of the privileges of arliament-; for t veiy 1we'l remember, and many of your lordships mav remcraber, that, not long age, the popular cry wast`
for the extension of privilege; and so far'did they carry it at
that time, that it was said, the privilege- protected memlbers
even:in criminal actions; nay, such was the power of poultar132                 2Ilthe- English Reader,         Pear  1.
prejudices over weak ninds, that the very decision of some
of-the courts were tinctured with that doctrine.  It was urn.doubtedly an abominable doctrine. I thought so then, and I
think so still: but, neverth'eless, -it was a popular doctrine,
and came immediately from those who are called the friends of
liberty; how deservedly, time will show. True liberty, in
my opinion, can only exist when justice is equally administered to all; to the king and to the beggar. Where is the justice then, o- where is the law that protects a member of parliament, more than any other man, from the punishment due
to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place,
nor any employment, to be a sanctuary- for crimnes; and
where I have the honour to sit as judge, neither royal favour.
nor popular applause, shall protect the guilty.
I have now only to beg pardon for having employed so much
of your lordships' time; and I am sorry a--bill, fraught with
so many good consequences, has not mnet with an abler advocate: but I doubt not your lordships' determination will convince the-world, that a bill, calculated- to contribute so much
to the equal distribution of justice as the present, requires with
your lordshipshuit very little support.
SECTION V.
An address to you.ng persons.
I INTEND, in this address, to show you the importance of beginning early to give serious attention to your conduct.  As
soon as you are capable of reflection, you must perceive that
there is a right and a wrong in human actions.  You see, that
those wh' ~are born with the same advantages of fortune, are
not.all equally prosperous in the course of life. While some
of them, by wise and steady conduct, attain distinction in the
world, and pass their days With comfort and- honour; others,
of the same rank, by mean and vicious behaviour, forfeit the
advantages of their birth; involve themselves in nmch misery; and end in being a disgrace to their friends, and a burden on society. Early, then, may you learn, that it is not on
the external condition in which you find yourselves placed,`but on the part which you are to act, that your welfare- or
unhappiness, your honour or infamy, depends.  Now, wvhen
beginning to act that part, what can be of greater moment,
than to regulate your plan of conduct with the most serious
attentioin, before you have yet committed any'fatal or irretrievable errors?  If instead of-exerting reflection for this
yaluable purpose.- you defver yourselves up., at so critioal aChap. 8.           -  Public Speeches.                   133
time, to sloth and pleasures; if you refuseo to listen to any
counsellor but humour, or to attend to anyipursuit except that
of amusement; if you allow yourselves tO: float- loose and
careless on the tide'of life, ready to receiv64any- direction
which the current of- fashion may chance to giv you; what
can you expect to follow  from  such beginnings T.While so
many around you are undergoing the sad consequences of a
like indiscretion, for what reason shall not those consequences
extend to  ou? Shall you attain success without that preparation, and escape dangers without that precaution, which are
required of others? Shall happiness grow ulp to you, of its own
accord, and solicit your acceptance, when, to the rest of mankind, it is the fruit of long cultivation, and the acquisition of
labour and care? -Deceive not yourselves with those arroganthopes.  Whatever be your rank, Providence will not.
for your sake, reverse its established order.  The Author of
your being hath enjoined you to "take heed to your ways;
to ponder the paths of your feet; to remember your Creator
in the days of your youth."  He hath decreed, that they only " who seek after wisdom, shall find it;' that fools shall be
afflicted, because of their transgressions; and that whoever
refuseth instruction, shall destroy his own soul." By listening to these admenitions, and tempering the vivacity of youth
with a proper mixture of serious thought, you may ensure
cheerfulness for the rest of life; but by delivering yourselves
up at present to giddiness and levity, you lay the foundation
of lasting heaviness of heart.
When you look forward to those plans of life, which either
you0ircumstances have suggested, or your friends have proposed, you will not hesitate to acknowledge, that in order to
pursue them with advantage, some previous discipline is requisite. Be assured, that whatever is to be your profession,
no education is more necessary to your success, than the acquirement of vlrtuous dispositions and habits.  This is the
universal preparation for every character, and every station
in life.  Bad as the world is, respect is always paid to virtue.
InI the' usual course of human affairs, it will be found, tlhat a
plain understanding, joined with acknowledged worth, conttibultes more to prosperity, than the brightest part without pro;bity or honour.  WVhether science, or business, or public life,
be your aim, virtue still enters, for a principal share, into all
those great departments of society.  It is connected with
eminence, in every liberal art; with -reputation in every branch
of fair and useful -business; with distinction in every publ"k
M                       -134                 The English Reader.             Part 1.
station. The vigour which it gives the mind, and the weight.which it adds to character; the generous sentiments which it
breathes; the undaunted spirit which it inspires; the ardour
of diligence which it quickens; the freedom which it procures from pernicious and dishonourable avocations; are the
fobundations of all that is highly honourable, or greatly successful among men.
Whatever ornamental or engaging endowments you now
possess, virtue is a necessary requisite, in order to eir shining
with propef lustre. Feeble are the attractions of the fairest
form, if it be suspected that nothing within corresponds to
the pleasing appearance without.' Short are the triumphs of
wit, when it is supposed to be the vehicle of malice.  By
whatever means you may at first attract the attention, you
can hold the esteem, and secure the hearts of others, only by
amiable dispositions, and the accomplishments of the mind.
These are the qualities whose influence will last, when the
lustre.of all that once sparkled and dvzzled has passed away.
Let not then the season of youth be barren of improvemeents, so essential to your future felicity and honour. Now
is the seed-time of life; and according to " what you sow, you
shall reap." Your chalacter is now, under Divine Assistance,
of your own forming; your fate is, in some measure, put into
your own bands. Your nature is as yet pliant arid soft. Habits
have not established their dominion.  Prejudices have not
pre-occupied your understanding.  The world has-not had
time to contract and debase your affections. All your powers
are more vig6oous, disembarrassed, and free, than they will be
at any future period. Whatever impulse- you now gire to
your desires and passions, the direction is likely to continue.
It will form the channel in which your life is to run; nay, it
may determine its everlasting issue. Consider then the employment of this important period, as the highest trust which
shall. ever be committed to you;_as in a g eat measure, decisive of your Ifppiness, in time, and in eternity. As in the
succession of the seasons, each, by the invariable laws of
nature, affeAc the productions of what is next in course; so,
in human life, every period of our age, according as it is well
or ill spent. influences the happiness of that which is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accomplished
and flurishing manhood; and such.manhood passes of itself,
withoQut uneasiness, into respectable and tranquil,old age.
But when nature is turned out of its regular course,disorder
takes place in the moral, just as in -the vegetable world. Ift
/          (.Chap. 8.            Public Speeches.                 135
the spring put forth no blossoms, in summer there willfbe
no beauty, and in autumn, no fruit: so, if youth be trifled
away without improvement, manhood will probably be contemptible, and old age miserable. If the beginnings of life
have been " vanity," its latter end can scarcely be any other
than " vexation of spirit."
I shall finish this address, with calling your attention to
that dependence on the blessing of Heaven, which, amidst all
your endeavours after improvement, you ought continually to
preserve.  It is too common with the young, even when they
resolve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to set out with
presumptuous confidence in themselves. Trusting to their
own abilities for carrying them successfully through life, they
are careless of applying to God, or of deriving any assistance
from what tliey are apt tq reckon the gloorny discipline of religion. Alas!'how littld do they know the dangers which
await them? Neither human wisdom, nor human virtue, unsupported by religion, is equal to the trying situations which
often occur in life.  By the shock of temptation, how frequently have the most virtuous intentions been overthrown?
Under the pressure of disaster, how often has the greatest
constancy sunk? " Every good, and every perfect gift, is
from above." Wisdom and virtue, as well as "' ricthes and
honour, come from God." Destitute of his favour, you are Di
no better situation, with all your boasted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackless desert, without any guide
to conduct them, or any shelter to cover them from the
gathering storm. Correct, then, this ill-founded arrogance.
Expect not, that your happiness can be independent of Him
who made you.. By faith and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of the world.  By piety and prayer, seek the protection of the God of heaven.  I conclude with the solemn
words, in which a great prince delivered his dying charge to
his son: words, which every young person ought to consider
as addressed to himself, and to engrave deeply on his heart:
"Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy fathers; and
v3erve him with a perfect heart, and Wvith a willing.mind. For
the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.  If thou seek him, he will be
found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
for ever.";                                        LAB.CHAPTER IX.

Earthquake at Calabria, in the year 1638.
AN account of this dreadful earthquake, is given by the
celebrated father Kircher.  It happened whilst he. was on his
journey to visit Mount tEtna, andt-he rest of the wonders that
lie towards the South of Italy.  Kircher is considered, by
scholars, as one of the greatest prodigies. of learning. -.
",Having hired a boat, in company with four m:-ore, (two
friars of the order of St. Francis, and two seculars,) we
lhunched from the harbour of Messina, in Scily; and arrived,
the same day, at the promontory of PEiorus.  Our destination
was for the city of Eu'phaemia, ini Calabria; where we had
some business to transact;.and where we designed to tarry
for some time.  Howeve'r, Providence seemed willing to cross
our design; for w-e were obliged to continue'three- days at
Pelorus, on_atount of the weather; and though we often put
out t-a, yet we were as often driven back.  At length,... -earied with the delay, we resolved to prosecute our voyage;
and, although the sea seemed more than usually agitated, we
ventured forward.  The gulf f Charybdis, which we apo
proached, seemed whirled round in such a manner, as to form
a vast hollow, verg,ing to a point in the centre.  Proceeding
onward, and turning my eyes to AEtna, I saw it cast forth
large volumes of smoke, of mountainous sizes, which entirely
covered the island, and blotted out the very shores from my
view.  This, together with the dreadful noise, and the sul
phurous stench which was strongly perceived, filled me with
apprehensions, that some more dreadful calamity was impending.'The sea itself seemed to wear a very unusual appearawcee they who have seen a lake in a violent shower.of rain,,
covered all over with bubbles, will conceive some idea of its
agitations.  My surprise was still increased, by the calmness
and serenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud, which
might be -supposed- to put all nature thus into motion.:
therlefore warned my companions, that an earthquake wasap- _
proaching; and, after some time, making for the shor with
all possible diligence, we landed at Tropawa, happy asd thankful for havin; escaped the threatening dangers of the sea"C7wap. 9.           Promiscuous Pieces.                137
"Blt our triumphs at land were of short duration; for we
had scarcely arrived at the Jesuit's College, in that city, when
our ears were stunned with a horrid sound, resembling that of
an infinite number of chariots, driven fiercely forward; the
wheels rattling, and the thongs cracking.  Soon-after this, a
most dreadful earthquake ensued; so that the whole tract
upon which'we stood seemed to vibrate, as if we were in the
scale of a balance that continued wavering. This motion,
however, soon grew mole violent; and being no longer able
to keep my legs, I was thrown prostrate upon the ground. In
the mean time, the universal ruin round me redoubled my
amazement.  The crash of falling houses, the tottering of
towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to- raise
ny terror and despair. On every side of me, I saw nothing
but a scene of ruiAh; and danger threatening W'herever I should
fly. I recommended myelf to God, as my last great refuge
At that hour, O how vain was every sublunary happiness!
Wealth, honour, empire, wisdom, all mere useless sounds, and
as empty as the bubbles of the deep! Just standing on the
threshold.of eternity, nothing but God was my please!re; and
the nearer I approached, I only loved him the more. After
some time, however, finding that I remained unhurt, amidst
the general concussion, I resolv d to venture for safety;: and
running as fast as I could, I reached the shrore, hut almost
terrified out of my reason. I did not search long here,'till I
found the boat in which I had landed; and my. companions
also, whose terrors were even greater than mine.  Our
meeting was not of that kind, where every one is desirous of
telling his own happy escape: it was all silence, and a gloomx
dread of impending terrors."
"Leaving this seat of desolation, we prosecuted our voyage
along the coast; and the next day came to Rochetta, where
we landed, although 4he earth still continued in, violent agitations. But we had scarcely arrived at our inn, when we were
once more obliged to return to the boat; and, in abouwt hllf
an hour, we saw the greater part of the town, and the inn at
which we had set up, dashed t: the ground., and burying -th
inhabitants beneath the ruins."
"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little vessel,
finding no safety at land. and yet, from the smallness of our
boat, having but a very dangerous continuance at sear we at
length landed at Lopiziunr  a castle midway between Trop9aa
andlEuphaemia, the city to which, as I said before, we w_rebodil Hfere, wherever I turned my eyes, nothing butous, natural, expressive tones of'spieecl, are suppressed; and a few artificial, unmeaning reading notes, are substituted for them.
But when we recommend to readers an attention to the tone and language of emotions, we must be understood to do it with proper limitation.
Moderation is-necessary in'his p6int, as it, is in loth-er things. For when
reading becomes strictly imitative, it assumes a theatrical manner, and
must be highly improper, as well as give offence to the hearers; -because
it is inconsistent with'that delicacy and modesty, which are indispensable
en such occasions. The speaker who delivers his own emotions must be
supposed to be more vivid atd%animated, than would be proper in the person who relates %them at' second hand.
We shall conclude this section with the following rule, for the tones
that indicate the passions aid emotions. "' in reading, let all your tones of
expression be borrowed from those of common speech, but, in some degree, more faintly characterised. Let.those tones which signify any disagreeable passion of the mind, be still more faint thals those which indicate
agreeable emotions; and, on all occasions, preserve yourselves-from being
so far affected with the subject, as to be-able to proceed through it, with
that easy and masterly manner, whirh has its good effects in this, as well
as -in evelry other art."
SECTON VII.
Pauses.
PAUSEs or rests, in speaking or reading, are a tOtal cessation of'the voice,
during a perceptible, and in many ecases, a measurable space ef time.
Pauses are equally necessary to the speaker, and the hearer. To the speaker, that he may take breath, without which he cannot proceed far in delivery; and that be may, by these temporary restsi-relieve the organs of
speech, which othlierwise would be soon:tired by continued act'in: to the
hearer, that the ear also may be relieved from the fatigue, whibm it would
otherwise endure from a continuity of sound; and that th-e understanding
may have suficient time t6 mark the distinction-of sentences, and their
several members.
There are two kinds of pauses: fir3t, emphatical pauses; and next, such
as mark the distinctions of sense. An emphatical pause is generally made
after something has been said of peculiar moment, and n which we desire
to fix the,hearer's attention. Sometimes, I fore. such a thing is said, we,usher it in with a pause of this nature. Such pauses have the same effect
as a strong emphasiss; and are subject to the same Vtles; especiallyd to the
Caution, of not repeating themtoofreuently. For as they excitetneommon atntion, and of course raiseexpectation, if the importance of the
matter be tlot fully answerable to such expectation, they occasion disappbitament and disgust.
But the most frequent and the prineial sea of pauses, is to mark thedlivisions- of the sense, and at the sane time ito alw t-he reader to dr iai
beith; andthe proper and delicate adjustment of such pauses ts one of
the most nice and difficult articles of deiivery. In all reading the manageu
meat of the breath requires a good deal of care, so as not to oblige us to
divide-words from one another, which have so intimate a conne1ion, that
they bught to-be pronounced with the same l*eath, and without the least
separation. Many a sentence is mlserably mangled, and the force of the
emphasis totally lost, by divisions being made in the wrong place. To avoid
this, every one, while he is reading, should be very careful to;provides a
bull suaply ofbreath for-whathe is to utter. It is a-great,mistake to imagine,

scenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and castles levellee
to the ground; Stromboli, though at sixty miles distanc&amp;
belching forth flames in an unusual manner, and with a noise
which I could distinctly hear. But my attention was'quickly
turned from more remote, to contiguous danger.  The rumbling sound of an approaching earthquake, which we by this
time were grown acquainted with, alarmed us for the consequences; it every moment seemed-to grow louder, and to appioach nearer.  The place on which we sftod now began to
shake most dreadfully: so that- being unable to stand, my
companions and I caught hold of whatever shrub grew next
to us, and supporte ourselves in that manner."
"After some tim( this violent paroxysm ceasing, we again
stood up, in order  ao prosecute our voyage to Euphamia,
which lay within sight.  In the mean time, while we were
preparing for this purpose, I turned my eyes towards the city,
but could see only a frightful dark cloud, that seemed to rest
upon the place.  This the more surprised us, as the weather
was so very serene. We waited, therefore, till the cloud had
passed away: then turning to look for the city, it was totally
sunk.  Wonderful to tell! nothing but a dismal and putrid
lake was seen where it stood.  We looked about to find some
one that could tell us of its sad catastrophe, but could see no
person.  All was become a melancholy solitude; a scene of
hideous desolation. Thus proceeding pensively along, in quest
of some human being that could give us a little information,
we af length sawv a boy sitting by the shore, and appearing
stupified with terror.  Of him, therefore, we inquired concerning the fate of the city; but he could not be prevailed
on to give us an answer.  We entre4ted him, with every expression of tenderness and pity to tell us; but his senses were
quite wrapt up in the contemplation e  the danger he had
escaped.  We offered him some victuals, but he-seemed to
loath the sight. We still persisted in our offices of kindness;
but he only pointed to the place of the city, like one out of
his senses; and then ruinnin  ip into the woods, was never
heard of after.  Such was tf  fate of tne city of Euphzemia.
As we continued our melancholy course along the shore, the
whole coast, for the space of two hundred miles, presented
nothing but the remains of cities; and men scattered, without a habitation, over the- fields.  Proceeding thtls along, we
at length ended our distressful voyage by arriving at Naples,
after having escaped a thousand dangers both at sea and

Letter from PLINY to GEMrNIUS
Do we not solnetimes obsers-e a sort of people, who though
they are themselves under the abject dominion of every vice,
show a kind'of malicious resentment against the errors of
others; and are most severe upon those whom they most resemble? vet, surely a lenity of disposition, even in persons
who have the least occasion for clemency themselves, is of all
virtues the most becoming.  The highest of all characters,
in my estimation, is his, who is as ready to pardon the errors
of mankind, as if he were every day guilty of some himself;.
and, at the same time, as cautious of committing a fault, as
if he never forgave one. It is a rule then which we shor'd,
uponr all occasions, both private and public, most religiously
observe; " to be inetorable to our own failings, while we,
treat those of the rest of the world with tenderness, nof excepting.even such as forgive none but themselves."
I shall, perhaps, be asked, who it is that has given occasion
to these reflections. Know then that a certain person lately-but of that when we meet-though, upon second thoughts,
not even-then; lest, whilst I condemn and expose his conduct,
I shall act counter. to that maxim I particularly recommend.
Whoever therefore, and whatever he is, shall remain in silence: for tho'ugh there may be some use, perhaps, in setting
a mark upon the man, for the sake of example, there will be
more, however, in sparing him, for the sake of humanity.

forbearance, with what patience, with what courage, did she
endure her last illness! She complied with all the directions
of her, physicians; she encouraged her sister, and her father:
and, when all her strength of body was exhausted, supported
herself by the single vigour of her mind.  That, indeed, continued, even to her last moments, unbroken by the pdin of a
long illness, or the terrors of approaching death; and it is a
reflection which makes the loss of her so mpch the more to
be lamented. A loss infinitely severe! and more severe by
the particular conjuncture in which it happened! She was
contracted to a- most worthy youth; the -wedding day was
fixed, and we were all invited. -How sad a change from the
highest joy, to the deepest sorrow! How shall I express the

its affliction,) ordering the money he had designed.to lay out
upon clothes and jewels for her marriage, to be employed in
myrrh and spices for her funeral! He is a man of gre4t learning and good sense, who has applied hilnlelf, from his earliest
youth, to the noblest and most elevatef studies: but all the
maxims of fortitude which he has received from books, or advancedOhimself, he now absolutely rejects; and every other
virtue of his heart gives place to all a parent's tenderness.
We shall excuse, we shall even approve his sorrow, when we
consider what he has lost. He has lost a daughter who resembled him in his manners, as well as his person; and exactl3
copied out all her father.  If his friend Marcellinus shall think
proper to write to him, upon the subject of so reasonable $
grief, let me renfind him not to use the rougher arguments oi

SECTION IV.
On discretion.
I MHAV  often thought, if the minds of men were laid open,
we should see but little difference~ between that of a wise
maan, and that of a fool.
There are infinite reveriae, numberless extravagances, atChap. 9.             Promzsruous.?eces. -               141
a succession of vanities, which pass tSough both.  The great
difference is, that the first knows how to pick and cull his
thoughts for conversation, by suppressing some, and commi-r
hicating others; whereas the other lets them all ind'ifferently
fly out inwords.''This sort of discretion, however, has no
place in private conversation between intimate friends.  On
such occasions, the wisest men very often talk like the weakest; for indeed talking with a friend is nothing else than thinking aloud.
Tully has therefore very jTistly exposed a precept, delivered by some ancient writers, That a man should live with his
enemy in such a manner, as might leave him room to become
his friend; and with his friend, in such a manner, that, if he
became his enemy, it should not be in his power to hurt him*.
The first part of this rule, which regards our behaviour towards an enemy, is indeed Very reasonable; as well as very
priudential; but'the latter part of it, which regards our behaviour towards a friend, savours more of cunning than of discretion: and would cut a man off frtm the greatest pleasures
of life, which are the fieedoms of conversation with a bosom
friend.' Besides that, when'iend is turned into an enemy,
the world is just enough tB-cWuse the'perfidiousness of the
friend, rather than the-indiscretion of the person who confided: -
in him.
Discretion does not only show -itseif in words, but in all the
circumstances of action; and is I'e tan under-agent of Providence, to guide and direct us ir:he ordinary concerns of life.
There are many more shini'  qualities in the mind of man,
but there is none so useful as  scretion.  It is this, indeed
which gives a value to all t!  -st; which sets them at work
in their proper times and places; -and turns them to the ad4
vantage of the person who is possessed of them.  Without it,
learning is pedantry; and wit impertirience; virtue itselflooks ~
like weakness; the best parts-only qualify a man to be more
sprightly in errors, and active to his own prejudice.
Discretion does not only make a man the master of his own;
parts, but of other men's.  The discreet man finds out the tal-.,.'lents of those he converses with; and'knows how to-apply''
them to proper uses.  Accordingly, if we look into particular
communities and divisions of men, we may observe, thait is
the -discreet man, not the witty, nor -the-learned, nor tbhe
brave, who guides the conversation, and gives measures:to
society.  A man with great talents, but void of discretion,
is like Polyphemus in tbh. Cable, strong and blind; endued142     -             77e English Reader.           Part 1.
with an'lrresistible force, which, for want of sight, is of no
use to him.
Though a man has all other perfec,ionD, yet if he wants
discretion, he will be of no great conse-qu:ence in the world;
on the contrary, if he has this single talcnt in perfection, and
but a common share of others, he may do what he pleases in
his particular station of lile.
At the same time that I think discretion the most useful talent a man can be master of, I look upon cunning to be the
accomplishment of little, mean, ungenerous minds.  Discretion points out tne- noblest ends to us; and pursues the most
proper and laudable methods of attaining them: cunning has
only privateselfish aims; and sticks at nothing which may'
make them succeed.  Discretion has large and extended
views; and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind ofahort-slghtedness, that discovers the
minutest objects which are near at hand, but is not able to discern things at a distance.  Discretion, the more it is discovered, gives a greater authority to the person who possesses
it: cunning, when it is. once detected, loses it force, and
makes a man incapable of brirnog about even those events
which he might have done, 1;q*lhe passed only for a plain
man.  Discretion is the perfection of reason; and a guide to
us in all the duties of life: cunnin, is a kind of instinct, that
only looks out after our immediate interest and welfare.
Discretion is only found in men of strong sense and good understandings: cunning is often to be me. with in brutes themselves; and in persons who are but the fewest removes from
them.  In short, cunning is only the minimic of discretion; and
it may pass upon weak men, in the same manner as vivacity
is.,often mistaken for wit, and gravity, for wisdom.
The:cast of mind which is natural to a discreet man, makes
him look forward into futurity, and consider what will be his
condition millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at present. He knows that the misery or happiness which is reserved for hlm in another world, loses nothing of its reality by
bbeing placed -so great a distance fror him. The objects
do0not appear iitfle to him because they are remote. He
considers, thaf those. pleasures and pains which lie hid in
eternity, approach nearer to him every moment; and will be  
present with him in their full weight and measure, as much as
those pains and pleasures which he feels at this very instant.
For thiDreasor6, -he is careful to secure to himself that which
is th. proper happiness of his natl,re, and the ultimate design(M7ap. 9,      Promiscuous Pieces.                   143
of his being. He carries, his thoughts to the end of every
action; and considers the most distant, as well as the most
immediate effects of it. He supersedes every little prospect
of gain and advantage which offers itself here, if he- does not
find it consistent with his views of an hereafter.  In a word,
his hopes are full of immortality; his schemes are large and
glorious; and his conduct suitable to one who knows his true
interest, and how to pursue it by proper methods. ADDISON.
SECTION V.
On the government of our thoughts.
A MULTITUBE of cases occur, in which we are no less accountable fort what we think, than for what we do.
As, first, when the introduction of any train of thought depends upon ourselves, and is our voluntary act, by turning our
attention towards such objects, awakening such passions, or
engaging in such employments, as we know must give a peeuliar determination to our thoughts.  Next, when thoughts,
by whatever accident they may have been originally suggested,
are indulged with deliberation and complacency.- Though the
mind has been passive in their reception, and, therefore, free
from blame; yet, iK it be active in theirscontinuance, the guilt
becomes its own. They may have intruded at first, like unbidden guests; but if whenw entered, they are made welcome,
and kindly entertained, the cswe is the same as if they -had
been i mvited from the beginning. If we are thus- accountable
to God for thoughts either voluntarily in-toduced, or deliberately indulged, we are no less so, in the last place, for
those which find admittance into our hearts from sifpine
negligence, from total relaxation of attention, from allowing
our imagination to rove with entire license, " like the eyes of
the fool, towards the end of the earth." Our minds are, in
this case, thrown open to folly and vanity. They are postltuted to every evil thing which pleases to take possession.
The consequences must all be charged to our account; and
in vain we plead -excuse from human infirmity. Hence it appears, that the great object at which we are to aim in govern- -
ing our thoughts, is, to take the -most effectual measure*r  
preventing the introduction of suchb as are sinful; and for
hastening their expulsion, if they shall have introduced themselves without consent of the will.
But when we descend into our breasts, and examine hotw  
far we have studied to keep this object in view, who can tell,
"how oft he hath offended L' in no articte of religion Xrmorals are men more culpably remiss, than in the unrestrained
indulgence thei give to fancy; and that too, for the most
part, without remorse.  Since the time that reason began to
exert her powers, thought, during Dur waking hours; has been
active in every breast, without a moment's suspension or pause.
The current of ideas has been always flowing.  The wheels
of the spiritual engine have circulated with perpetual motion.  Let me ask, what has been-the fruit of this incessant
activity, with the greater part of mankind? Of the innumerable hours that have been employed in thought, how few are
marked with "any permanent or'useful effect? How many
have either passed away in idle dreams; or. have been abandoned to anxious discontented musings, to- unsocial and malignant'passions, or to irregular and criminal desires? Had I
power to lay open that storehouse of iniquity which the hearts
of too many conceal; could I draAw out and read to them a
list of all the imaginations they have devised, and all the passions they have indulged in secret; what a;-picture of men
should I present themselves! What crimes would they appear to have perpetrated in secrecy, which to their most intimate companions they durst not revqal!
Even when men imagine their thoughts to be innocently
employed, they too commonly suffer them to run out into extravagant imaginations, and chimerical plans of what they
would wish to attain, or choose to be, if they could frame the
course of things according to their desire.  Though such employments of fancy come not under the, same description with
those which are plainlv criminal, yet wholly unblamable they
seldom are.  Besides the waste of time which they occasion,
and the mlsapplication which they indicate of those intellectual powers that. were given to us for much nobler purposes,
such romantic speculations lead us always into the neighbourhood of forbidden -regions.  They place us on dangerous
ground.  They are, for the most part, connected with some
one bad passion; and they always nourish a giddy and frivolous turn of tnought. They unfit the mind for applying with
vigour to rational pursuits, or;for acquiescing in sober plans
of conduct.  From that ideal world in which'it allows itself
to dwell, it retfrri to the commerce of men, unbent and relaxed, sickly and taihihtd, averse to discharging the duties, and
sometimes disqualified even for relishing the pleasures of orjlinary life.                                      BIiAIR.

Part 1.SECTION VI.
On the evils which flow from unrestrained passions.
WHEN man revolted, from his Maker, his passions rebelled
against himself; and, from being originally the ministers of
reason, have become the tyrants of the soul. Hence, in treating of this subject, two things may be assumed as principles:
first, that through the present weakness of the understanding, our passions are often directed towards improper objects;
and next, that even when their direction is just, and their objects are-innocent, they perpetually tend to run into excess;
they always hurry us towards their gratification, with a blind
and dangerous impetuosity.  On these.two points then turns
the whole government of our passions: first, to ascertain the
proper objects of their pursuit; and next, to restrain thein in
that pursuit, when they would- carry us beyond the bounds
of reason.  If there is any passion which intrudes itself un
seasonably into our mind, which darkens and troubles our
judgment, or habitually discomposes our temper; which-unfits us for properly discharging the duties, or disquialifiesKus for
cheerfully enjoying the comforts of life, we may certainlw
conclude it to have gained a dangerous asceudant.  The great
object which we ought to propose to ourselves is, to acquire
a firm and steadfast mind, which the inrfatuation of passion
shall not seduce,-nor its violence shake; which, resting on
fixed principles, shall,in the midst of contending emotions, remain free, and master of itself; able to listen calmly to the
voice of conscience, and prepared to obey its dictates'without
hesitation.  
To obtain, if possible, such command of passion, is one of
the highest attainments of the rational nature.  Arguiments
to show its importance crowd upon us from every quarter.
If there be any fertile source of mischief to--human lif, it is,
lbeyond doubt, the misrule of passion.  It is this whichl-poisons the enjoyment of individuals, overturns the order of so-:
ciety, and strews the path of life with so many miseries, as to
render it indeed the vale of tears.  All those great seeiof
public calamit-y, which we behold with astonishmen-t 4 i
ror, have originated from the source of violent passions. These
have overspread the earth with bloodshed. These have pqint-;ed the assassin's dagger, and filled the poisoned bowl. These,
in every age, have furnished too copious materials for the orator's pathetic declamation, and for the poet's tragical song.

Whe.n from ptrblic life we descend to private conduct,
though passion opert-es not there in so wide and destructive
a sphere, we shall find its influence to be no less baneful.  I
need not mention the black and fierce passions, such as envy,
jealousy, and revenge, whose effects are obviously noxious,
and whose agitations are immediate misery. But take any of
the licentious and sensual kind. Suppose it to have unlimited
scope; trace it throughout its course; and we shall find that
gradually, as it rises, ittaints the soundness, and-troubles the
peace, of his mind over whom it reigns; that, in its progress,
it engages him in pursuits which are marked either with danger or with shame; that, in the end, it wastes his fortune, destroys his health, or debases his character; and aggravates
all the miseries in which it has involved him, with the concluding pangs of bitter remorse.  Through all the stages of
this fatal course, how many have heretofore rib? What-multitudes do we daily behold pursuing it, with blind and headlong steps?                                         BLAIR.
SECTION VII.
On the proper state of our temper, with respect to one another.
IT is evident, in the general, that if we consult either public welfare or private happiness; Christian charity ought to
regulate our disposition in mutual intercourse.  But as this
great principle admits of several diversified appearances, leie
us consider some of the chief forms under which it ought to
show itself in the usual tenor of life.
What,, first, presents itself t'o be- recommended,.is a peace.
able temper; a disposition averse to give offence, and desirous of cultivating harmony, and amicable intercourse in society. This supposes yielding and condescending manners,
unwillingness to contend with others -bhout trifles, and, in contests that are unavoidable, proper moderation uf spirit  Such
a temper is the first principle of self-enjoyment.  It is the basis of all order and happtness among mankind.  The positive
and contentious, the rude and quarrelsome, are the bane ofsociy.: They seem destined to blast the small.share of comfort  hich' nature has here allotted to man.  But they cannot
ditturb the peace of others, more than they break their own.
The hurricane rages first in their own bosor, before it is let
forth upon the worl&amp;.-~-' In the tempests which they raise, they
ar'e always  tost; aird fquently it is their lot to perish.
A pe I table tempamnut be supported by acandid oDr, or  Chap. 9.             Promiscuous Pieces.                 147
a disposition to view the conduct of others with fairness and
impartiality.  This stands opposed to a jealous and suspicious
tempelr, which ascribes every action to the worst motive, and,
throws a black shade over every character. If we would
be happy in ourselves, or in our connexions with others, let
us guard against this malignant spirit.  Let us study that
charity," which thinketh no evil;" that temper which, without degenerating into credulity, will dispose us to be just;
and which can allow us to observe an error, vithout imputing
it as a crime. Thus we shall be kept free from that continual irritation, which imaginary injuries raise in a suspicious breast;
and shall walk among men as our brethren, not as our enemies.
But to be peaceable, and!o be candid, is not all that is required of a good man.  Hie must cultivate a kind, generous,
and sympathizing temper, which feels for distress, wherever
it is beheld; which enters into the concerns of his friends
with ardour; and to all with whom he has intercourse, is gentle, obliging, and humane.  How  amiable appears such a
disposition, when contrasted with a malicious or envious temper, which wraps. itself up in its own narrow interest, looks
with an evil eye on the success of others, and, with an unnatural satisfaction, feeds on their disappointments or miseries! How little does he know of the true happiness of life,
who-is a stranger to that intercourse of good offices and kind
affections, which, by a pleasing charm, attaches men to one
another, and circulates joy from heart to heart!'We are not to imagine, that a benevoleNnt temper finds nc
exercise, unless when opportunities offer of performing actions of high generosity, or of extensive utility.  These may
seldom occur.  The condition of the greater part of mankitd
in a good measure, precludes them.  But, in the ordinary
round of human affairs, many occasions daily present themselves, of mitigating the vexations which others suffer; of
soothing their minds; of aiding their interest; of promoting
their cheerfulness, or-ease.  Such occasions may relate to the  
smaller incidents of lifti  But let us remember, that of sE
incidents the systexg of human life is chiefly composed.  e:~
attentions which respect these, when suggested by realt benignity of temper, are often more material to the happinessof::
those around us, than actions which carry- the appearane f:
greater dignity and. splendour.  No wise or good man ought
to account any rules of behaviour as below his regard, which
tend to cement the great brotherhood of mankind in comfo tabe  union.INTRODUCTION. iii
that the breath must be drawn only at the end- of a period, wh.nt tile
voice is allowed to fall. It may easily be gathered at the intervals of the
period, when the voice is suspended only for a moment; and, by this
management, one may always have a sufficient stock for carrying on the
longest sentence, without improper interruptions.
Pauses in readilng must generally beformed upon the manier in which
we utter ourselves in ordinary, sensible conversation; and not upon the
stiff artificial manner, which is acquired from reading books according to
the common punctuation. It will by no means be sufficient to attend to
tile points used'in printing; for these are far from marking all the pailse.s
which ought to be made. in reading. A mechanical attention to these resting places, has perhaps been one cause of monotony, by leading the reader to a similar-tone at every stop, and a uniform cadence at every period.
The primary use of points, is to assist the reader in'-discerning the grammatical construction; and it is only as a secondary object, that they regulate his pronunciation.. On this head, the following direction may be of
use: " Though in reading great attention shouild be paid to the stops,- yet
a greater should be given to the sense; aynd their correspondent times.occasionally lengthened beyond what is usual in common speech."
To render pause.s pleasing anrd expressive, they must not only be made
in the right place,: but also accompanied with a proper tone of voice, by
which the nature of these pauses is intimated; much more than by the'length of them, which can seldom be exactly nmeasured.  Sometimes it is
only a slight and simplensuspension of voice that is proper; sometimes a
degree of cadentze in the voice- is required; and sometimes that peculiar
tone and cadence which denote the senl;ence to be finished. In all these:cases, we are to regulate ourselves by attending to the manner in which
nature teaches us to speak, when engaged in real and earnest discoulrsei
with others. The following sentence exemplifies the -s'.rpendiaig and the
- closing pauses: " Hope, the balm of life, sooths us under every mnisfortune.'
The first and seeond pauses are accompanied by an inflection of voice, that
gives the hearer an expectation of something ftirther.to comrplete the sense:
the inflection attending  the  third  pat-  signifies that the  sense  is completed.      -                               --
The preceding example is an illustration of the gtuspending pause, in its
simple state: the following instance exhibiits that pause with a degree of
cadence in the voice; "If content cannot remove-the disquietudes of mankind, it will at least alleviate them."
The suspending pause is often; in the same sentcnce, attended with
both thernising and the falling inflection of voice; as will be seen in
this example: "-' Moderate exercise', and labitual temperanlce', strenvhea
the constitution."                       ht   tr
As the suspending pautse may be thus attended with:both the rising and
the failling inflection, it is the same with regard to the closing pause; it
8alnits.of both. The falling inflection generallv accomalies it; but it is
rnoi nfrequently coniiected with the rising inflection..;nterrog e;ive sen
tences, for instance, are often termninated itl this manner: as, -4 Am  I  Pi-.
gratefuil'?"  " Is he in earnest'?"
But-where a sentence is begun by an ir'irrogative pronoun oradverb, it
is conmmon-ly terminated by the filling inflection: as.  What has h-e --ainyby his folly' " " Who will assist him':?"   Vhere is the messeniger?
"When did he arrive'-'

Particularly amidst that familiar intercourse which belongs
to domes-ic life, all the virtues of temper find an ample range.
It is very unfortunate, that within thiat circle. -men too often
think themselves at liberty, to give unrestrained vent to the
caprice of passion and humour.  Whereas there, on the contrary, more than any where else, it- concerns them to attend
to the government of their heart; to check what is violent in
their tempers, and to soften what is harsh in their manners.
For there the temper is formed.  There, the real character
displays itself. The forms of the world disguise men when
abroad.  But within his own family,, every man is known to
be what he truly is.-In all our intercourse then with other',
particularly in that which is closest and most intimate; let us,ultivate a peaceable, a candid, a gentle, and friendly temper.
This is the temper to which, by repeated injunctions, our
holy relligion seeks to form  us.  This was the temper of
Christ.  This is the temper of Heaven.SECTION  VIII.

is it bigotry to believe the sublime truths of the Gospel,

the man who is possessed of it: for, amidst all the vicissitudes
and calamities of the present state, that man enjoys an inexhaustible ftund of consolation, of which~it is not ink the

There ai--f-ht6a th e:rith, so favourable to all the kin4,
iind all the sublime affections; or so unfriendly to hatred and
)persecution, to tyranny, to injustice, and every sort of malevolence, as the Gospel.  It breathes nothing throughout, but
mercy, benevolence, and peace.: Poetry is sublime, when it awakens in the mind any great
and good daffection, as piety, or patriotism.  This is one of the
noblbest effects of the art.  The Psalms are remarkable, be-    -:a:ll other writings, for their power of inspiring devout::emotions.  But it is'   in this respect only, that they are
sublime.  Of the divine nature, they contain the most magnificent descriptions, that the soul of man can comprehend.
Thei hundred and fourth Psalm, in particular, disphays, the
power and goodness of Providence, in creating and prerving the world, and the various tribes of animals in it, with

Such of the doctrines of the Gospel as are level to human
capacity, appear to be ageeeable to the purest truth, and the
soundest morality. All the genius and learning of'the heathen
world; all the penetration of Pythagoras, Socrates, and Aristotle, had never been able to produce such a system of moral
duty, and so rational an account of Providence and of man, as,
are-to be found in the New Testament. Compared, indeed,with this, all other moral and theological wisdom

Reflections occasioned by a review of the blessings pronounced
by Christ on his disciples, in his sermon on the mount.
WHAT abundant reason have we to thank Glad, that this
large and instructive discourse of our blessed Redeemer, is so
particularly recoided by the sacred historian.  Let every
one that "hath ears to hear," attend to it: for surely no man
ever spoke as our Lord did on this occasion. Let us fix oulr
minds in a posture of humble attention, that we may "receive
the law from his mouth.'
He opened it with blessings, repeated and most important
blessings. But on whom are they pronounced? and whom
are we taught to-think the happiest of mankind? The meek
and the humble-; the penitent and the mercifill; the peaceful
and the pure - those that hunger and thirst after righteousness; those that labour, but faint not, under persecution!

which becomes us, as we sustain the character of " the sail

Is there not reason to lament, that we answer the character
no better? Is there not reason to exclaim with a good man
in former times, " Blessed Lord! either these are not thy
words, or we are not Christians!" Oh, season our hearts more
effectually with thy grace P'Pour forth that divine oil on our

to fdil; the curls of beauty fell from his head; strength departed from his hands; and agility from  his feet. He gave
back to the calif the keys of trust, andsthe seals of secrecy:
and sought no other pleasure for the remains of life, than the
converse of the wise, and the gratitude- of the good.
The powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His chamber was filled by visitants, eager to catch the dictates of experience, and officious to pay the tribute of admiration.
Caled, the son of the viceroy of Egypt, entered every day
early, and retired late.  He was beautiful and eloquent:
Omar admired his wit, and loved his docility.  " Tell me,"
said Caled. " thou to whose voice nations have listened, and
whose wisdom is known io the extremities of Asia, tell me
how I may resemble Omar the prudent. The arts by which
thou hast gained power and preserved it, are to thee no longer

anid ten I will pass in foreign countries; I shall be learned,
and therefore shall be honoured; every city will shout- at my
arrival, and every student will solicit rily friendship. Twenty
years thus passed, will store'ly mind with images, which I
shall be busy, through the rest of my life, in combining and
comparing.  I shall revel in inexhaustible accumulations of
intellectual riches; I shall find new pleasures for every moment; and shall never more be weary of myself. I will not,
however, deviate too far from the beaten track of life; but
will try what can be found in female delicacy. I will marry
a wife beautiful as the Houries, and wise as Zobeide: with
her I will live twenty years within the suburbs of Bagdat, in
every pleasure that wealth can purchase, and fancy can invent.  I will then retire to a rural dwelling; pass my days
in obscurity and contemplation; and lie silently down on the

I will never stand exposed to the artifices of courts; I will
never pant for public honours, nor disturb my quiet with

impressed indelibly upon my memory."
"The first part of my ensuing time was to be spent in
search of knowledge, and I know not how I was diverted from
my design.  Ihad no visible impediments without, nor any
ungovernable passions within.  I regarded knowledge as the
highest honour, and the most engaging pleasure; yet day
stole upon day, and month glided after month, till I found
that seven years of the first ten had vanished, and left nothing
behind them. I now postponed my purpose of travelling;

learned at home? I immured myself for four years, and studied the laws of the empire. The fame of my skill reached

travelling was past; and thought it best to lay hold on the
felicity yet in my power, and indulge myself in domestic pleasures.  But at fifty no man easily finds a woman beautiful as
the Houries, and wise as Zobeide. I inquired and rejected,
consulted and deliberated, till the sixty second year made me
ashamed of wishing to marry.  I had now nothing left but
retirement; and for retirement I never found a time, till disease forced me from public employment."
"Such was my scheme, and such has been its consequence.
With an insatiable -thirst for knowledge, I trifled away the
years of improvement; with a restless desire of seeing differentcountries, I have always resided in the same city; with
the highest expectation of connubial felicity, I have lived unmarried; and with unalterable resolutions af contemplative

The p7easures of virtuous sensibility.
THE good effects of true sensibility on general virtue and
happiness, admit of no dispute. Let us consider its effect on
ihe happiness of him who possesses it, and the various pleasures to which it gives him access. If he is master of riches
or influence, it affords him the means of increasing -his own
enjoyment, by relieving the wants. or increasing the comforts
of others. If he commands not these advantages, yet all the
comforts, whlich he sees in the possession of the deserving, become in some sort his, by his rejoicing in the good which they
enjoy. Even the face of nature yields a satisfaction to him,
which the insensible can never know. The profusion of goodhness, which he beholds poured forth on the universe, dlates
his heart with the thought, that innumerable multitudes around:r-:,i  are blest and happy.  When he sees the labours of men
0to prosper, and views a country flourishing in wealth
- wen' he beholds the spring coming fort.i-:ts

Tnfi. proper honour of man arises'ot from isome of those
-plendid actions and abilities, which excite high admiration.'Courage and prowess, military renown, signal victories and
conquests, may render the name- of-a  man famous, without
rendering his character tr*lly honourable. To many brave.
men, to many heroes renofwned in story, we look up with wonder.  Their exploits are recorded.  Their praises are sulng.
They stand as on an -minence above the rest of mankind.

true honour lies, we must look, not to any adventitious circumstance of fortune; not to any single sparkling quality;
but:o the whole of what forms a man; what entitles him, as
such, to rank high among that class of beings to which he
belongs; in a word, we must look to the mind and the soul.
A mind superior to fear, to selfish interest and corruption; a
mind governed by the prinrciples of uniform rectitude and integrity; the same in prosperity and adversity; which no
bribe can seduce, nor terror overawe; neither by pleasure
melted into effeminacy, nor by distress sunk into dejection:
such is the mind which forms the distinction and eminence of
man.--One, who in no situation of life, is either ashamed or
afraid of discharging his duty, and acting his proper part
with firmness and constancy; true to the God whom he worships, and true to the faith in which he professes to believe;
full of affection to his brethren of mankind; faithful to his
friends, generous to his enemies, warm with compassion to the
unfortunate; self-denying to little private interests and pleasures, but zealous for public interest and happiness: magnanimous, without being proud; humble, without being mean;
Just, without being harsh; simple in hismanners, but manly
in his fe4ings; on whose words we can entirely rely; whose
countenance never deceives us; whose professions of kindness
are the effusions of his heart: one, in fine, whom, independent
of any views of advantage, we would choose for a superior,
could trust in as a friend, and could love as a brother-this is
the man, whom  in our heart, above all others, we do, we
must honour.                                         BLAIR.

ITe influence of devotion on the&amp; happiness of life.
WHATEVER promotes and strengthens virtue, whatever
calms -and regulates the temnper, is a source of happiness.
Devotion produces these effects in a remarkable degree.  tk
inspires composure of spirit, mildness, and benignity; weak,.
ens the painful, and cherishes the pleasing emotions; arid,h
these means, carries on the life of a pious,man in aw a i
and placid tenor.
Besides exerting this habitual influence on the mind, devotion opens a field of enjoyments, to which the vicious are.
entire strangers; eDjoyments the more valuable, as they,
pecuiarly belong to retirement, when the world leaves us;
and to adversity, when it becomes our foe. These are the
two seons, for-which every wise man would most wish to156                 Thle Entglish Reader.           Part 1.
provide some hidden store of comfort.  For let him be pla.ed
in the most favourab!e situation which the human state admits, the world can neither always amuse him, nor always
shield him from distress.   There will be manv hours of
vacuity, and many of dejection, in his life.  If he be a stranger
to God, and to devotion, how dreary will the gloom  of solitude often prove! With what oppressive weight will sickness,
disappointment, or )old age, fall upon his spirits.  But for
those pensive periods, the pious man has' a relief prepared.
From the tiresome repetition of the common vanities of Ife,
or from the painful corrosion of its cares and sorrowvs, devotion transports him into a new region; and surrounds him
there with such objects, as are the most fitted to cheer the
dejection, to calm the tumults, and to heal the wounds of his
heart.  If the woild has been empty and delusive, it gladdens
him with the prospect of a higher and better order of things,
about to arise. If men have been ungrateful and base,- it
displays before him the faithfulness of that Supreme Being,
who, though every other friend fail, will never forsake him.
Let us consult our experience, and we shall find, that thte two
greatest sources of inwlrd joy, are, the exercise of love
directed towards a deserving object, and the exercise of hope
terminating on some high and assured happiness.  Both these
are supplied by devotion; and therefore iwe have no reason
to be surprised, if; on some occasions, it fills the hearts of
good men with a satisfaction not to be expressed.
The refined pleasures of a pious mind are, in many respects, superior to the coarse gratifications 9f sense.  They
are pleasures which belong to the highest powers and best affections of the soul; whereas the gratifications of sense reside
in the lowest region of our nature.  To the latter, the soul
stoops below its native dignity.  The former, raise it above
itself. The latter, leave always a comfortless, often a mortifying, remembrance behind them.  The former, are reviewed:With applause and delight.  The pleasures of sense resemble
a foaming torrent, which, after a disorderly course, speedily
runs out, and leaves an empty and offensive channel.  But the
pleasures of devotion resemble the equable current of a pure
river, which enlivens the fields through,which it -passes, and
d:-?iffuses verdure and fertility along its banks.  To thee, O
Devotion! we owe the highest impro-vement of our nature,
and much of the enjoyment of our life.  Thou art the support
of our virtue, and the rest of our souls, in t,his turbulent world.
T'hou conmposest the thou,hts.  Thou calmest the pAss1ons?.C?hap. 9            I'rcniseuous Pieces,                i157
Thou exaltest the heart.  Thy communications, and thine
only, are imparted to the low, no less than to the high; to the
poor, as well as to the rich.  In thy presence, worldly distinctions cease; and under thy influence, worldly sorrows are
forgotten.  Thou art the balm  of the wounded mind.  Thy
sanctuary is ever open to the miserable; inaccessible only to
the unrighteous and impure.  Thou beginnest on earth the
temper of heaven. In thee, the hosts of angels and blessed
spirits eternally rejoice.                         BLIR.

/?The planetary and terrestrial worlds comnparatively considered.
To us, who dwell on its surlice, the earth is by far the
most extensive orl) that our eyes can any where behold: it is
also clothed with verdure, distinguished by trees, and adorned
with a variety of.beautiful decorations; whereas, to a specta#or placed on one of the planets, it wears a uniform aspect;
fooks all luminous; and no larger than aspot. To beings who
dwell at still greater distances, it entirely disappears.'That
which we call alternately the morning and the evening star,
(as in one part of the orbit she rides foremost in the procession
of night, in the other ushers in and anticipates the dawn,) is
a planetary world. This planet, and the four others that so
wonderfully vary their mystic dance, are in themselves dark
bodies, and shine only by reflection; have fields, and seas, and
skies, of their own; are furnished with all accommodations for
animal subsistence, and are supposed to be the abodes of intellectual life; all which, together with our earthly habi  n,
are dependent on that grand dispenser of Divine munii:ii  e,
the sun; receive their light from the distribution of hib rays,
and derive their comfort from his benign agency.
T,-The sun, which seems to perform  its daily stages thrlgll
the sky, is in this respect fixed and immoveable: it i_
great axle of heaven, about which the globe we inhabit, and'
other more spacious orbs, wvheel their stated corsn.-  The
sun, though seemingly smallter:qn the diaiif-:iiates  is
abundantly larger than this wih * arth, on which soblman y
lofty mountains rise, and such  toceans roll.  a line estending from side to side through:-centre of that resplendent orb, would measure more than ei,,  undred thousand
miles: a girdle formed to go round its circdinferenee, would
require a length of millions.  WereeAits solid. -ontents to be
estimated, the account would overwhelrm our understanding,
be almost beyond the power of lang:age to express. AreWhen tvo questions are united in one sentence, and connected by the
conjunction or, the first takes the rising, the se6ond the- falling inflection-:
as, " Does his conduct support discipline', or destroy it''  
The rising and falling inflections must not be confounded with emphasis.
Though they may often coincide, they are, in their nature,. perfectly distinct. Emphasis sometimes controls those inflections.
The regular application of the rising and falling inflections,- confers so
much beauty on expression, and is so necessary to be studied by the young
reader, that we shall insert a few more examples to induce him  to pay
greater attention to the subject. In these instances, all the inflections.are,not marked. Such only are distinguished, as are most striking, and will
best serve to show the reader their utility and importance.
"Manufactures', trade', and agriculture', certainly employ more than
nineteen parts in twenty of the hurman species."
" He -who resigns the world has no temptation to envy', hatred', malice',
anger'; but is in constant possession of a serene mind: he who follows
the pleasures of it, which are in their very nature disappointing, is in constant search of care', solicitude', remorse', and confusion'."
"To advise the ignorant', relieve the needy', comfort thile afflicted', are
duties that fall in our -ay almost every day of our lives."
" Those evil spirits, who,-by long custom, bave contracted in the body
labits of lust' and sensuality'; malice', and revenge'; a-n aversion to every
thing that is good', just', and laudable', are haturally. seas6ned and prepared for pain and misery.":I am  persuaded, thatl neither desth', -nor life'; nor angels', nor
principalities', nor powers'; nor, things present', nor things to come'; nor
height', nor depth';i nor any other creature', shall be able to separate us
from the love of God';"
The reader who would wish to see a minute and ingenious investigation
of the nature of these inflections, and the rules by which they are governed, may conlsult Walker's Elements of Elodution.
SECTION VIII..Manner of readinig Verse.
WiREN we are reading verse, tiere is a peculiar difficulty in making the
pauses justly.. The dificulty arises from the -melody of verse, which dictates to the ear pauses or rests of its own: and to adiust andl compound
these properly with the pauses of the sense, so as neitlier toi urt the ear,
nor offend the, understanding, is so very nice a matter, that it is no wonder
we so seldom meet with good readers of poetry. There ae two kinls of
pauses that belong to the melody of verse: one is, the puse at the end.of the line; and the -other, the cesural pause in or near the/ middle of' it.
With regard to thepause at the end of the line, which marks that strain.
or verse to be finished,.rhyme renders tliis always' sensible; and in some:
measure compels us to observe it in our pronlnciation. JIn respect'to.
blank v-erse, we ought also to read it so as to make every line sensible
to the ear: for, what is the use of melody, or for what end has thle poet
comnposed in verse, if, in reading his lines, we' suppress his ntWmbers, by
Omitting the gfinalpause; and decgade them, by ou  pronlunciatiln, jnt.o

we startled.t thiese reports of philosophy! Are we ready to
cry out in a transport of surprise, " How mighty is the Being
who kindled so prodigious a fire; and keeps aliye, from age to
age, so enormous a mass of flame!" let us attend our philosophical guides, and we shall be brought acquainted with
speculations more enlarged and more inflaming.
This sun with all its attendant planets, is but a very little
part of the grand machine of the universe: every star, though
in appearance no bigger thtn the diamond that glitters upon a  
lady's ring, is really a vast globe, like the sun in size and in I
glory; no less spacious, no less luminous, than the radiant,
source of day. So that every star, is not barely a world, but
the centre of a magnificent system; has a retinue of worlds,
irradiateA by its beams, and revolving round its attractive influence, all which are lost to our sight in unmeasurable wilds
of ether. That the stars appear like so many diminutive, and
scarcely distinguishable points, is owing to their immense and
inconceivable distance. Immense and inconceivable indeed it
is, since a ball, shot from the loaded cannon, and flying with
unabated rapidity, must travel, at this impetuous rate, almost
seven hundred thousand years, before it could reach the
nearest of these twinkling luminaries.
WVhile, beholding this vast expanse, I learn my own ext"eme
meanness, I would also discover the abject littleness of all
terrestrial things. What is the earth, with all her ostentatious
scenes, compared with this astonishing grand furniture of the
skies? What, but a dim speck, hardly perceivable in the map
of the universe? It is observed by a very judicious writer, that
if the sun himself, which enlightens this part of the creation,
were extinguished, and all the host of planetary worlds, which
move about him, were annihilated, they would not be "missed
by an eye that can take in the whole compass of nature, any.t     than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore.  The bulk of
which they consist, and the space which they occupy, are so
exceedingly little in comparison of the whole, that their loss
would scarcely leave a blank in the immensity of God's
works.  If then, not'our globe only, but this whole system, be
so very diminutive, what is a kingdom or a country?  What
are a few lordships, or the so much admired patrimonies of
those who are styled weafthy? When I measure them with
rny own little pittance, they swell into proud and bloated dimensions: but when I take the universe for my standard, how
scanty is their size! how contemutible their figure   They
shrink into pompous nothings.                    AMDISON.  159
SECTION XV.
On the power of custom, and the uses to which it miay be applied.
THERE is not a common saying, which has a better turn of \
sense in it, than what we often hear in the mouths of the
vrulgar, that " Custom is a second nature."  It is indeed able
to form the man anew; and give him  inclinations and capacities altogether different from those he wvas born with.  A
person who is addicted to plav or gaming, thoug)h he took b-ut
little delight in it at fipst, by degrees contracts so strong an
inclination towards it, and gives himself up so entirely to it,
that it seems the onlyv end of his being. The love of a retired or busy life will grow upon a man insensibly, as he is conversant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified
for relishing that to which he has been for sometime disused.
Nay, a man may smoke, or drink, or take snuff, till he is unable to pass away his time without it; not to mention how our
delight in any particular study, art, or science, rises and improves, in proportion to the application whichi   bestow up-'on it.  Thus, what was at first an exercise, beco6mes at length
an entertainment  Our employments are changed into diversions.  The mind grows fond of those actions it is accustomed
to; and is drawn with ireluctancy from those paths in which
it has been used to walk.
If we attentively consider this property of human nature,
it may instruct us in very fine moralities.  In the first place,
I would have no man discouraged with that kind of life, or
series of action, in which the choice of others, or his own necessities, may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very disagreeable to him, at first; but use and application will certainly render it not only less painful, but pleasing and satisfactory.
In the second place, I would recommend to every one, the
admirable precept, which Pythagoras is said to have given to
hlis disciples, and which that philosopher must' have drawn
from the observation I have enlarged upon: " Pitch upon
that course of life which is the most excellent, and customn
will render it the most delightful."   Men, whose circumstances will permit them to choose their own way of life, are
inexcusable if they do not pursue that wlhic. -their judgment
tells them is the most laudable.  The voice of reason is more
to be regarded, than the bent of any present inclination:
since, by the rule above mentioned, inclination will at length
conme over to reason, though we can never fobrce reason to
cmaply with inclination.
C, Aap. 9.I G                 TAhe English Reader.             Part 2.
In the third place, this observation may teach the most
sensual and irreligious man, ts overlook those hardships and
&amp;dKJculties, which are apt to discoulrage him from the prosecution of a virtuous life.  " The gods," said Hesiod, " have
placed labour before virtue; the way to her is at first rough
and difficult, but grows more smooth and easy the farther we
advance in it." The man who proceeds in it with steadiness
and resolution, will, in a little time, find that " her ways are
ways of pleasantness, and that all her paths are peace."
To enforce this consideration, we may further observe, that
the practice of religion will not only be attended with that'
pleasure which naturally accompanies those actions to which
we are habituated, but with those supernumerary joys of
heart, that rise from the consciousness of such a pleasure;
fiomn the satisfaction of acting up to the dictates of reason;
and from the prospect of a happy immortality.
In the fourth place, we may learn from  this observation
which we have made on the mind of man, to take particular
care, when we are once settled in a regular course of life, how
we too frequently indulge ourselves in even the most innocent diversions and entertainments; since the mind may insensibly fall off from the relish of virtuous actions, and by
degrees, exchange that pleasure which it takes in the per
formance of its duty, for delights of a much inferior and an un
profitable nature.
The last use which I shall make of this remarkable pro
perty in human nature, of being delig-hted with those actions
to which it is accustomed, is, to show how absolutely neces
sary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we
wvould enjoy the pleasures of the next. -The state.of bliss we
call heaven, will not be capable of affecting those minds
which are not thus qualified for- it: we- must, -in this world,
gain a relish for truth and virtue, if we would be able to taste
that knowledge and perfection, which are to make us happy
in the next. The seeds of those spiritual joys and raptures,
which are to rise up and flourish in the soul to all eternity,
must be planted in it during this its present state of probation.

Description of candour.
TPRE candour is altogether different from that guarded, inoffen ive language, and that studied openness of behaviour,
which we so frequently meet with among men of the world.
Smiling, very often, is the aspect, and smooth are the words,
of those who inwardly are the most ready to think evil of
others. That candour which is a Christian virtue, consists,
not in fairness of speech, but in fairness of heart;  It may
want the blandishment of external courtesy, but supplies its
Jlace with a humane and generous liberality of sentiment.
Its manners are unaffected, and its professions cordial.  Exempt, on one hand, from the dark jealousy of a suspicious
mind, it is no less removed, on the other, from that easy credulity which is imposed on by everj specious pretence.  It is
perfectly consistent with extensive knowledge of the world,
and with due attention to our own safety.  In that various interc6iurse, which we are obiiged to carry on with persons of
every different character, suspicion, to'a certain degree, is a
necessary guard.  It is only when it exceeds the bounds of
prudent caution, that it degenerates into vice.  There is a
proper mean between undistinguished credulity, and universal.
jealousv, which a sound'understanding discerns, and which
the marn of candour studies to preserve.

which is to be found in every human character. lie expectfnoqe to be faultless; and he is unvwilling to believe that there
is any without some commendable qualities.  In the midst o
many defects, he can discover a virtue.  Under the influence
of personal resentment, he can be just to the merit of an enemy. He never lends an open ear to those defamatory reports
and dark suggestions, which, among the tribes of the censorious, circulate with so much rapidity, and meet with so ready
acceptance.  He is not hasty to judge; and he requires full
evidence before he will condemn. As long as an action can
be ascribed to different motives, he holds it as no mark of sagacity to impute it always to the worst. Where there is just
ground for doubt, he keeps his judgment undecided; and, during the period of suspense, leans to the most charitable construction which an action can bear.  When he must condemn,
he condemns with regret; and without those aggravations
ivhich the severity of others adds to the crime. He listens
ealmly to the apology of the offender, and readily admits every
oetenuating circumstance, which equity can suggest.  How
mauch soever he may blame the principles of any sect or party, he never confounds, under one general censure, all who
belong to that party or sect.- He charges them not with such
consequences of their tenets, as they refuse and disavow.
From one wrong opinion, he does not infer the subversion of
all sound principles; nor from one bad action, conclude tbat
all regard to conscience is overthrown.  When he " beholds
the mote in his brother's eye," he remembers " the beam in
his own."  He commiserates human frailty; and judges of
others according to the principles, by which he would think
it reasonable that they should judge of him.  In a word, he
views men a0d actions in the clear sunshine of charity and
good nature; and not in that dark and sullen shade which
jealousy and party-spirit thjrow over all characters.   BLAIR.
SECTION XVIII.
On the imperfection of that happiness which rests solely on world.
ly pleasures.
THF, vanity of human pleasures, is a topic which might be
embellished with the pomp of much description. But I shall
studiously avoid exaggeratior, and only point out a threefold
vanity in human life, which every impartial observer cannot
but admit; disappointment in pursuit, dissatisfaction in enjoy.
ment, uncertainty in possession.First, disappointment in pursuit.  When we look around
us on the world, we every where behold a busy multitude, intent on the prosecution of various designs, which their wants
or desires have suggested. We behold them employing every
method which ingenuity can devise; some the patience ofi
industry, some the boldness of enterprise, others the dexterity of strlatagem, in order to compass their ends.  Of this
incessant stir and activity, what is the fruit-? In comparison
of the crowd who have toiled in vain, how small is the nuniber of the successful? Or rather, where is the man who will
declare, that in every point he has completed his plan, and attained his utmost wish? No extent of human abilities has
been able to discover a path which, in any line of life, leads
unerringly to success.  "The race is not always to the swift,
nor the battle to the strong,nor riches to men of understanding."We may form our plans with the most profound sagacity, and
with the most vigilant caution may guard against dangers on
every side.  But some unforeseen occurrence comes across,
whiich baffles our wisdom, and lays our labours-in the dust.
Were such disappointments confined to those wvho aspire
at engrossing the higher departments of life, the misfortune
would be less.  The humiliation of the mighty, and the fall
of ambition from its towering height, little concern the bulk
of mankind.  These are objects on which, as on distant meteors, they gaze from afar, without drawing personal instruction from events so much above them.  But, alas! when we
descend into the regions of private life, we find disappointment and blasted hope equally prevalent there.: Neither the
moderation of our views, nor the justice of our pretensions,
can ensure success. But c" time and chance happen to all."
Against the stream of events, both the worthy and the undeserving are obliged to struggle; and both are frequently overborne alike by the current.
Besides disappointment in pursuit, dissatisfaction in enjoyment is a farther vanity, to which the human state is subject.
This is the severest of all mortifications; after having been
successful in the pursuit, to be baffled in the ehibyment itself.
Yet this is found to be an evil still more general than the former.  Some may be so fortunate as to attain what they have
pursued; but none are rendered completely happy by what;
they have attained.  Disappointed hope is misery; and yet
successful hope is- only imperfect bliss.  Look through all th -
rans: of mankind.  Examine the conodtion of those who a:'
pear most prosperous; and you will find that they are nevetr

just what they desire to b6. If retired, they languish for action; if busy, they complain of fatigue. JIf in middle life, they
are impatient for distinction; if in high stations, they sigh after freedom  and ease.  Something is still wanting to that
plenitttde of satisfaction, which they expected to acquire
Together with every wish that is gratified, a new demand
arises. One void opens in the heart, as another is filled. On
wishes, wishes grow; and to the end, it is rather the expectation of what they have not, than the enjoyment of what they
have, which occupies and interests the most successful.
This dissatisfaction in the midst of human pleasure, springs
partly from the nature of our enjoyments themselves, and
partly from circumstances which corrupt them.  No worldly
enjoyments are adequate to the high desires and powers of an
immortal spirit. Fancy painlt them at a distance with splendid
coleors; but possession unveils the fallacy.  The eagerness
of passion bestows upon them, at first, a brisk and lively relish.  But it is their fate always to pall by familiarity, and
sometimes to pass from satiety into disgust. Happy would
the poor man think himself, if he could enter on all the treasures of the rich; and happy for a short time he might be:
but before he had long contemplated and admired his state,
his possessions would seem to lessen, and his cares would
grow
Add to the unsatisfyingnature of our pleasures, the attending circumstances which never fail to corrupt them.  For,
such as they are, they-are at no time possessed unmixed. To
human lips it is not given to taste the cup of pure joy. Whert
external circumstances show fairest to the world, the envied
man groans in private under his own burden. Some vexation
disquiets, some passion corrodes him; some distress, either
felt or feared, gnaws like a worm, the root of his felicity.
When there is nothing from without to disturb the prosperous,
a secret poison operates within. For worldly happiness ever
tends to destroy itself, by corrupting the heart. It fosters the
loose and the_iolent passions.  It engenders noxious habits;
and tailts the mind with false delicacy, which makes it feel a
thousand unreal evils.
But put the case in the most favourable light.  Lay aside
from human pleasures both disappointment in pursuit, and deceitfulness in enjoyment; suppose them to be fully attainable,
and completely satisfactory; still there remains to be considered the vanity of uncertain -possession and short duration.
Were there in worldly things any fixed point of secrity(hap.? 11)
Promiscuous Pieces.
which we could gain, the mind would then have some basis
on which to rest.  But our condition is such, that every thing
wavers and totters around us.  " Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth."  It
is much if, during its course, thou hearest not of somewhat to
disquiet or alarm thee.  For life'never proceeds long in a uni
form train. It is continually varied by unexpected events.
The seeds of alteration are every where sown; and the sunshine of prosperity commonly accelerates their growth. If
our enjoyments are numerous, we lie more&amp; open on different
sides to be wounded. If we hliave possessed them long, we
have greater cause to dread an approaching change.  By slow
degrees prosperity rises; but rapid is the progress of evil.  It
requires no preparation to bring it forward.  The edifice
which it cost much time and labour to erect, one inauspicious
event, one sudden blow, can level with the dust.  Even supposing the accidents of life to leave us untouched, human
bliss must still be transitory; for man changes of himself.
No course of enjoyment can delight us long.  What amused
our youth, loses its charm in matuirer age. As years advance,. our powers are blunted, and our pleasurable feelings decline.
The silent lapse of time is ever carrying somewhat from us
till at length the period comes, when all must be swept awAay.
The prospect of this termination of our labours and pursuits,
is sufficient to mark our state with vanity.  "' Our days are a
hand's breadth, and our age is as nothing."  Within that little
space is all our enterprise bounded.  We crowd it with toils:
and cares, with contention and stritfe.  We project great designs, entertain high hopes, and then leave our plans unfinished, and sink into oblivion.
This much let it suffice to have said concerning the vanity
of the world.  That too much has not been said, must appear
to every one who considers how generally mankind lean to
the opposite side; and ho-w often, by undue attachment to the
present state,-tley both feed the most sinful passions, and' pierce themselves through with many sorrows."    BLAIR.
SECTION  XIX.
What are the real and solid enjoyments of human life.
IT must be admitted, that unmixed and complete happiness
is unknown on earth. No regulation of conduct can altogether
prevent passions from disturbing our peace, and misfortunes
fiom wounding our heart.  But after this concession is made,
will it folltow, that' there is no object on earth which deserv~/'-.,f166                The English Reader.             Port i.
our pursuit, or that all enjoyment becomes contemptible
which is not perfect? Let us survey our state wiith an impartial eye, and be just to the various gifts of Heaven. How
vain soever this life, considered in itself, may be, the comforts and hopes of religion are sufficient to give solidity to
the enjoyments of the righteous.  In the exercise of good
affections, and the testimony of an approving conscience; in
the sense of peace and reconciliation with God, through the
great Redeemer of m lankind; in the firm confidence of being
conducted through all the trials of life, by infintite Wisdom
and Goodness; and in the joyful prospect of arriving, in the
end, at immortal felicity; they possess a happiness whiAh,,descending from a purer and more perfect region than this
world, partakes not of its vanity.
Besides the enjoyments peculiar to religion, there are other
pleasures of our present state, which, though of an inferior
order, must not be overlooked in the estimate of human life.
It is necessary to call attention to these, in order to check that
repining and unthankful spirit to which, man is always too
prone. Some degree of importance must be allowed to the
comforts of health, to the innocent gratifications of sense, and
to the entertainment afforded us by all the beautiful scenes
of nature; some to the pursuits and harmless amusements of
social life; and more to the internal enjbyments of thoiught.and reflection, and to the pleasures of affectionate intercourse
with those whom we love.  These comforts are often held in
too low estimation, merely because they are ordinary and comn
mon; although that is the circumstance which ought, in reason, to enhance their value. TheT lie open, in some degree,
to-all; extend through every rank of lifei; and fill up agreeably many of those spaces in our present existence, which are
not occupied with higher objects, or with serious cares.
From this representation it appears that, notwithstanding
the vanity of the world, a considerable degree of comfort is
attainable in the present state. Let the recollection of this
serve to reconcile us to our condition, and to repress the
arrogance of complaints and murmurs.-What art thou, O
son of man! who, having sprung but yesterday out of the
dust, darest to lift up thy voice against thy Maker, and to arraign his providence, because all things, are not ordered according to thy wish? What title hast thou to find fault with
the order of the universe, whose lot is so much beyo:d what

to have been admitted as a spectator of the Divine wisdom
and works; and to have had access to all the comforts whilch
nature, with a bountiful hand, has poured forth around thee?
Are all the hours forgotten which thou hast passed in ease, in
oomplacency, or joy? Is it a small favour in thy eyes, that
the hand of Divine MIercy has been stretched forth to aid
thee; and, if thou reject not its proffered assistance, is ready
to conduct thee to a happier state of existence? When thou
comparest thy condition with thy desert, blush, and be ashamed
of thy complaints. Be silent, be grateful, and adore. Receive with thankfulness the blessings which are allowed thee,
Revere that government which at present refuses thee more.
lRest in this conclusion, that though there are evils in the
world, its Creator is wise and good, and has been bountiful to
thee.                                               BLAIR,

Scale of beings.
THOUGH there is a great deal of pleasure in contemplating
the material world; by which I mean, that system of bodies,
into which nature has so curiously wrought the mass of dead
matter, with the several relations that those bodies bear to one
another; there is still, methinks, something more wonderful
and surprising, in contemplations on the world of life; by
which 1 intend, all those animals with which every part ot
the universe is furnished.  The material world is only the
shell of the universe: the world of life are its inhabitants.
If we consider those parts of the material world, which lie
the nearestlto us, and are thIrefore subject to our observation,
and inquiries, it is amazing'o consider the infinity of animals
with which they are stocked.  Every part of matter is peopled; every green leaf swarms with inhabitants. There is
scarcely a single humour in the body of a man, or of any
other animal, in which our glasses do not discover myriads
of living creatures. We find, even in the most solid bodies,
as in marble itselt, innumerable cells and cavities, which are
crowded with imperceptible inhabitants, too little for the naked
eye to discover. On the other hand, if we look into the more
bulky parts of nature, we see the seas, lakes, and rivers, teeming with numberless kinds of living creatures. We find every
monntain and marsh, wilderness and wood, plentifully stocked
with birds and beasts; and every part of matter affording
proper necessaries and conveniences, for the livelihood of the
multitudes which inhabit it.     -
C'N  T)-  ~   
I~~~~~F*either fallo e eleviation of the voice, it should be denoted only by so
slight a suspension of sound, as may distinguish the passage from one
line to another, without injuring the meaning.
The other kind of melodious pause, is that which falls somewhere
about the middi&amp;of the verse, and divides it into two hemistichs; a
pause, tnot so great'as that which belongs to the close of the -line, butstill
sensible to an fiordinary ear. This, which is called the c-esiral pause,
nmay ftill, irEnglishheroic verse, after tie I4th,  6th, or 7th syllable
in th.e line. Where the verse is so constructed, that this ciesural pause
coincides with the Islightest pause or diviion in the sense, the line can
be read e,sily  as in the two first verses of Pope's Messiah:
"Ye nymphs 6f Solyma"! begin the song;
- "To heav'nly themes', sublimer strains belong."
But if it-should happen that words which have so strict and intimate a
connexion, as not to bear even a momentary separation, are divided
from nne another by this- ceIsural pause, we then feel a sort of struggle
between the sense andAthe. sound, which renders it difficult to read such
lines harmoniously. The rule of phoper pronunciation in such cases, *
to- regard only the pause which the sense forms; and to read the line accordingly. -Theneglect of the caesural pause may make the line sound
somewhat unharmoniously; but the effect would be much wqre, if
the sense were sacrificed to the sound. For instance, in the followingline of Mi4ton,
"What in me is dark,
-   Illumine; what is low, raise and, support."
the sense clearly dictates the pause after illumine, at the end of the third
syllable, which,.in reading, ought to be made accordingly; though, ifthe
melody only were to be regarded, illumine should be connected with
what follows, and the pause not made till the fourth or sixth syllable. So
in the followi'ng line of Pope's Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnotb
"I sit, with sad civility I read."
the ear plainly points out the caesural- pause as falling after sad, the fourth
syllable. But it would be very bad reading to make any pause there, z
as to separate sad and civility. The ense admits of no other pause than
after the second syltbfl sit, which therefore must be the only pause made
in reading this part of the sentence.
There is another mode of dividing some verses, by introducing what
may be' called demi-caesuras, which require very slight pauses -and which
the reader should manage with judgment, or he will be apt to fall into an
affected sing-song mode of pronouncing verses of this kind. The folloring lines exemplify the demi-ciesura.      -

ITRODUCTION.,VIB168                FThe English Readcer.           Part i.
The author of "the Plurality of Worlds," draws a very
good argument from this consideration, for the peopling of
every planet; as indeed itseems very probable, from the analogy of reason, that if no part of matter, with which we areacquainted, lies waste and useless, those great bodies, which
are at such a distance from us, are not desert and unpeopled;
but rather, that they are furnished with beings adapted to
their respective situations.
Existence is a blessing to those beings only which are endowed with perception; and is in a manner thrown away upon
dead matter, any farther than as it is subservient to beings
which are conscious of their existence.  Accordingly we
find, from the bodies which lie under our observation, that
matter is only made as the basis and support of animals; and
that there is no more of the one than what is necessary for
the existence of the other.
Infinite Goodness is of so communicative a nature, that it
seems to delight in conferring existence upon every degree of
perceptive being. As this is a speculation, which I have often pursued with great pleasure to myself, I shall enlarge farther upon it, by considering that part of the scale of beings,
which comes within oir knowledge.
There are some living creatures, which are raised but just
above dead matter.  To mention only that species of shellfish, which is formed in the- fashion of a cone; that growvs to
the surfitce of several rocks; and immediately dies, on being
severed from the place where it grew. There are many other
creatures but one remove from these, which have no other
sense than that of feeling and taste.  Others have still an additional one of hearing; otfiers of smelli; and others, of sight.
It iswvonderful to observe, by what a gradual progress the
world of life advances, through a prodigious variety of species, before a creature is formed, that is complete in all its
senses: and even among these, there is such a different degree of perfection, in the sense which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the sense in different animals is distinguished by the same common cenomination, it seems almost of a different nature.  If, after this, we
look into the sev-eral inward perfections of cunning and sagacity, orfw:b we generally call instinct, we find them rising,
afterthie rnanner, imperceptibly one above another; and
receiir-.w'iditiona'l improvements, according to the-species
in which they are implanted.  This progress in nature is so
very gradual, that the most perfect of an inferior species,Cf?ap. 9. g         Promiscuous Pieces.                   i CO
comes very near to the most imperfect of that which is immediately above it.
The exuberant and overflowing goodxess of the Supreme
Being, whose mercy extends to all his works, is plainly seen,
as I have before hinted, in his having made so very little matter, at least, what falls within /our knowledge, that does not
swarm with life.  Nor is his goodness less seen in the diver--
sity, than in the multitude of living creatures.  ftHad he mlade
but one species of animals, none of the rest would have enjoyed the happiness of existence: he has therefore, specycied,
in his creation, every degree of life, every capacity of being.
The whole chasm of nature, from  a plant to a man, is filled
V:p with divers kinds of creatures, rising one after another,
by an ascent so gentle and easy, that the little transitions ard
deviations from one species to another, are almost insensible.
This intermediate space is so well hu~banded aiid managed,
that there is scarcely a degree of perception, which does not
appear in some one part of the world of life.  Is tile goodness, or the wisdom of the Divine Being, more manifested in
this his proceeding?
There is a consequence, besides those I have already mentioned, which seems very naturally deducible from  the foregoing considerations.  If the scale of being rises by so regular a progress, so high as man, we may, by parity of reason,
suppose, that it still proceeds gradually through those beings
which are of a superior nature to him; since there is infinitely greater space and room for different degrees of perfection,
between the Supreme Being and man,- than between man and
the most despicable insect.
In this great system of being, there is no creature so wonderful in its nature, and which so much deserves our particu-.
lar attention, as man,; who fills up the middle space betwee2.
the animal and the intellectual natlre, the visible and thie iavisible world; and whox is that link in thle chain of b:5ng,
which forms the connexion between both.  So that he who.
in one respect, is associated with an els and arch argei, -,n i
may look upon a being of infinite perfe tion ias his Tather, and
the highest order of spirits as his brethren, may, in.another
respect, say to "corruption, thou art my father, a&amp;nd:t the

wretched being.  tie is subject every moment to the greatest
calamities and misfortunes. He'is beset widl dangers on all
sides; and may become unhappy by numberless casualties,
which he could not foresee, nor have prevented had he foreseen them.
It is our comfort, while we are obnoxious to so many ac-'
cidents, that we are under the care of ONE who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the management of every
thing that is capable of annoying or offending us; who knows
the assistance we stand in need of, and is always ready to be-?
stow it on those who ask it of him.
The natural homage, which such a creature owes to so infinitely wise and good a Being, is a firm reliance,on him for
the blessings and conveniences of life; and an aabitual trust
in him, for deliverance out of all such dangers and difficulties as may:befall us.
The man who always lives in this disposition of mind, has
not the same dark and melancholy views of human nature
as he who considers himself abstractedly from this relation to
the Supreme Being. At the same time that he reflects upon
his own weakness and imperfection, he comforts himself with
the contemplation of those divine attributes, which are employed for his safety, and his weltare. He finds his want of
foresight made up, by the omniscience of him who is his support.  He is not sensible of his own want of strength, -when
he knows that his helper is almighty. In short, the person
who has a firm trust in the Supreme Being, is powerful in his
power, wise by his wisdorn, happy by his happiness. He reaps
the benefit of every divine attribute; and loses his own insufficiency in the fulness of infinite perfection.  To make our
lives more easy to us, we are commanded to put our trust in
him, who is thus able to relieve and succour us; the Divine
Goodness having made such a reliance a duty, notwithstanding
we should have been miserable, had it been forbidden us.
Among several m-otives, which might be made use of to recommend this duty to us, I shall only take notice of those that
follow.
The first and strongest is, that we are propmised, he will
not fail those who put their trust in him.
But without considering the supernatural blessing, which
accompanies this duty, we may observe, that it has a natural,tendenc-y, to its own reward; or, in other vwords, that this
firm trust and confidence in the great Disposer of, all things,
cort, rilute very much to the getting clear of any affliction,ihap. 9.           Promzlscuous Pieces.                171
or to the bearing of it manfully.  A person who believes he
has his succour at haiid, and that he acts in the sight of his
friend, often exerts himselfbeyond his abilities; and does wonders, that are not to be matched by one who-is not animated
with such a confidence of success.  Trust in the assistance
of an Almighty Being, naturally produces patience, hope, cheerfulness, and all other dispositions of mind, which alleviate
those calamities that we are not able to remove.
The practice of this virtue administers great comfort to the
mind of man, in times, of poverty and affliction; but most of
all, in the hour of death.  When the soul is hovering, in the
last moments of its separation; wvhen it is just entering on
another state of existence, to converse with scenes, and objects, and companions, that are altogether new; what can
support her under such tremblings of thought, such fear, such
anxiety, such apprehensions, but the casting of all her cares,upon HIM, who first gave he' being; who has conducted her
through one stage of it; an4d who will be always present, to
guide and comfort her in her progress through eternity?

T'he sense of being distinguished by Jie kindness of another,
gladdens the heart, warms it with r tprocftl affection, and

relish, from its being tile gift of a friend.  Favours conferred'by men, I acknowledge, may prove burde nome.  For human
virtue is never perfect; and sometinges unr.isonable expectations on the one side, sometimes a mnorti'~ig sense of dependence on the other, corrode in secret the psures of benefits, and convert the obligations of friepdship  lto grounds of
jealousy.  But nothing of this kind can affect t  intercourse
of gratitude with Heaven.  Its favours are w ly  disinterested; and with a gratitude the most cordial and u Iuspicious,
a good man looks up to thiat Almighty Beirefacto   who aims

who desires no return from them, but a devout an       ifkful

the various steps of life, and cirowned him with the iost favourable distinction beyond his equals?
Let us farther consider, that not only-gratitude for the past,
but a cheering sense of divine favour at the present, enters
into the pious emotion.  They are only the virtuous, who in
their prosperous days hear this voice addressed to them, "Go
thy way,  tLhy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
cheerfut' b; ifor God now accepteth thy works."  He who
is the a    ot their prosperity, gives them a title to enjoy,
with complacency, his own gift.. J While bad men snatch the
pteasures of the world as by stealth, without countenance
from the great Proprietor of the world, the righteous sit
openly down to the feast of life, under the smile of approving
lheaven.  No guilty fears damp their joys.  The blessing of
God rests upon all-that they possess; his protection surrouinds:
them; and hence, " in the habitations of the righteous, is
found the voice of rejoicing and salvation."  A lustre unknown to others, invests, in their sight, the whole face of nature. Their piety reflects a sunshine from heaven upon the
prosperity of the world; unites in one point of view, the smiling aspect, both of the powers above, and of the--objects below.  Not only have they as full a relish as others, for the innocernt pleasures of life;'but, moreover, in- these they hold,
communion with their ivine benefactor.  In all-that is good
or fair, they trace his hand.  From the beauties of nature,

and of the table which he hadprepared for him in the presence of his enemies!" With what perfect tranquillity does
he look forward to the time of his passing through " the valley of the shadow of death;" unappalled by that spectre,
whose most distant appearance blasts the prosperity of sinners! He fears no evil, as long as "the rod and the staff" of
his Divine Shepherd are,with him; and, through all the unknown periods of this and of future existence, commits himself to his,guidance with secure and triumphant hope: "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life;
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever."-What
a purified, sentimental enjoyment of prosperity is here exhibited! How differenrt from that gross relish of worldly pleasures, which belongs to those who behold only the terrestrial
side of things; who raise their views to no higher objects
than the succession of human contingencies, and the weak efforts of human ability i who have no protector or patron in the

Virtue, zvhen deeply rooted, is not subject to the nftuence of
fortune.
THE city of Sidon having surrendered to Alexander, he
ordered Hephestion- to bestow the crown on him whom the
Sidonians should think most worthy of that honour. Hephesfion being'at that time resident with two yotung men of distinction, offered them the kingdom; but thev refused it, telling ihim that it was contrary to the' laws of their country, to
admit any one to that honour, who was not of the royal family.  Hethen, having expressed his admiration of their disinterested spirit, desired them to name one of the royal, race,
who might remember that he had received the crown through
their hands. Overlooking many, who would have been ambitious of this high honour, they made choice of Abdolony-'mus, whose singular merit' had rendered him  conspicuous,
even in thevale of obscurity. Though remotely related to the
royal family, a series of misfortunes had reduced him to the
necessity of cultivating a garden, for a small stipend, in the
suburbs of the city.   
While Abdolonymus was busily employed in we'4ing his
garden, the two friends of Hephestion, bearing in the:r'hands
the ensigns of royalty,, approached him, and saluted him king.
r'hey informed him that Alexander had appointed him to that

office; and required him imme'diately to exchange his rustic
garb, and utensils of husbandry, for the regal robe and scep,
tre. At the same time, they admonished him, when he shoula
be seated on the throne, and have a nation in his power, no'
to forget the hum1ble condition from which he had been raised.
All this, at the first, appeared to Abdolonymus as an illusion
of tile fancy, or an insult offered to his poverty. He requested
them not to troublc'him farther with their impertinent jests,
and to find some other way of amusing themselves, which
might leave him in the peaceable enjoyment of his obscure
bhabitation.-At length, however, they convinced him, that'they were serious in their proposal; and prevailed upon him
to accept the regal office, and accompany them to the palace.
No sooner-was he in possession of the government, than
pride and envy created him enemies; who whispered their
murmurs in every place, till at last they reached the ear of
Alexander.  He commanded the new-elected prince to be
sent for; and inquired of him, with what temper of mind he
had borne his poverty.  "Would to Heaven," replied Abdolonymus, 1"that I may be-able to bear my crown with equal
moderation-: for when I possessed little, I wanted nothing:
these hands supplied me with whatever I desired."' From this
answer, Alexander formed so high an idea of his wisdom, that
he confirmed the choice which had been made; and annexed
a neighbouring province to the government of Sidon.

appearance, and a little spot of ground; from which, by my
own labour. I draw my support. But if, by any means, thou
hast bieen persuaded to think that this poverty renders me of
less consequence in my own country, or in aniy degree unhappy, thou art greatly deceived.  I have no reason to comnplain
of fortuney, she supplies me with all that nature requires; and
ii I am without superfluities, I am also free from the desire of

the necessithus, the only advantage for whichithewealthy are

poor as I am, upon-a level with the richest: for Rome knows
no qualifications for great employments, buit virtue and ability.
She appoints me to officiate in the most august ceremonies of
religion; shle intrusts me with the command of her armies; she
confides to my care the most iinmportant negociations. My
poverty does not lessen the weight and influence of my counsels in the senate. The Roman- people -honour me for that
very poverty, which king Pyrrhus considers as a disgrace.
They know the many opportunities 1. have'had to enrich myself, withoult censure; they are convinced of my disinterested
zeal for their prosperity: and if I have any thing to complain
of, in the return they make me, it is only the excess of their
applause. What value, then, can I put upon thy gold and silver? What king can add any thing to my fortune? Always
-attentive to discharge the duties incumbent upon me, I have a
mind free from self-reproach; and I have an honest fame.

Character of JAMES I. king of England.
No PRINCE, so little enterprising and so inoffensive, was ever
so much exposed to the opposite- extremes -of calumny and
flattery,.of satire and panegyric.  And the factions which began in his time, being still continied, have made his character be as much disputed to this day, as is commonly that of
princes who are our contemporaries. Many virtues, however,
it must be owned,-he was possessed of; but not one of them
pure, or free from the contagion of the neighbouring vices.
His generosity bordered on profusion, his learning on pedantry, his pacific disposition on pusillanimity, his wisdom on cunning, his friendship on light fancy and boyish fondness. While
he imagined that he was only maintaining his own authority,
he may perhaps be suspected in some of his actions, and still
more of his pretensions, to have encroached on the liberties of
his people. While he endeavorured, by an exact neutrality, to
-cquire the good will of all his'neighbours, he was able to
preserve fully the esteem and regard of none. His capacity
was considerable, but fitter to discourse on general maxims,
than to conduct any intricate business.
His intentions were just, but more adapted to the conduot
of private life, than to the government of kingdoms. Awkward
in his person, and ungainly in his manners, he was ill.aified
-to command respect: partial andundiscerning in hisiaftections,
he was littl, fitted to acquire geL  al love.  Of a feeble temnc7i OP.-  9.

per, more than of a frugal judgment; exposed to our ridicule
from his vanity, but exempt from our hatred by his freedom
from pride and arrogance.  And, upon the whole, it may be
pronounced of his character, tfiat all his qualities were suIlied with weakness, and embellished by humanity.  Political
courage he was certainly devoid of; and from thence chiefly
is derived the strong prejudice, which prevails against his personal bravery: an inference, however, which must be owned,
from general experie Ice, to be extremely fallacious.  HUME.
SECTION XXVI.
CHARLES V. emperor of Germany, resigns his dominnions, and
retires from the -fzorld.
THIS great emperor, in the plenitude of his power, and in
possession of all the honours which can flatter the heart of
man, took the extraordinary resolution, to resign his kingdoms;
and to withdraw entiLely from any concern in business or the
affairs of this world, in order that he might spend the.remainder of his days in retirement and solitude. Though it requires
neither deep reflection, nor extraordinary discernment, to discover that the state of royalty is not exempt from cares and.
disappointments,-though most of those who are exalted to a
throne, find solicitude, and satiety, and disgust, to be their perpetual attendants, in that envied pre-eminence; yet, to descend
voluntarily from the supreme to a subordinate station, and to
relinquish the possession 9f power in order to attain the enjoyment of happiness, seems to be an effort too, great for the
human mind. Several ibstances, inideed, occur in history, ot
monarchs who have quitted a throne, and have ended their
days in retirement. But they were either weak princes, who
took this resolution rashly, and repented of it as soon as it was
taken; or unfortunate princes, from whose hands some strong
rival had wrested their sceptre, aid compelled them to descend
with reluctance into a private station. Dioclesian is, perhaps,
the only prince capable of holding the reigns of government,
who ever resigned them from deliberate choice; and who continued,: during many years, to enjoy.the tranquillity of retirement, witmlnt fetching one penitent sigh, or casting back one ~
look of desire, towards the power or dignity which he had
abandoned.  
*No wonder, then, that Charles's resignation should fill all
Europe with astonishment; and give rise, both among his contemporaries, and among the historians of that period, to variouis conjectures concerining the rwotives whichb eterumined aprince, whose ruling passion had been uniformly the love of
power, at the age of fifty-six, when objects of ambition operate
with full force on the mind, and are pursued-with the greatest
ardour, to take a resolution so singular anI-3nexpected.
The emperor, in pursuance of his determiriation, having assembled the states of the Low Countries at Brussels, seated
himself, for the last time, in the chair of state; on one side of
which was placed his son, and on the other, his sister the
queen of Hungary, regent of the Netherlands, with a splendid
retinue of the grandees of Spain and princes of the empire
standing behind him. The president of the council of Flanders,
by his command, explained, in a few words, his intention in
calling this'extraordinary meeting of the states. He then read
the instrument of resignation, by which Charles surrendered
to his son Philip all his territories, jurisdiction, and authority
in the Low Countries; absolving his subjects there from their
oath of allegiance to him, which he required them to transfer
to Philip his laiwful heir; and to serve him with the same
loyalty and zeal that they had manifested, during so long a
course of years, in support of his government.
Charles then rose from his seat, and leaning on the shoulder
of the prince of Orange, because he was unable to stand without support, he addressed himself to the audience; and, from
a paper which he held in his hand, in order to assist his memory, he recounted, with digrlity, but without ostentation, all the
great things which he had undertaken- and performed, since--
the commencement of his administration.  He observed, that
from the seventeenth year of his age, he had dedicated all his
thoughts and attention to public objects, reserving no portioa
of his time for the indulgence of his ease, and very little for
the enjoyment of private pleasure; that either in a pacific or
hostile manner, he had visited Germany nine times, Spain six
times, France four times, Italy seven timnes, ti4/   untries
ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and. 1ad made
eleven voyages by sea; that while his health permitted him to
discharge his duty, and the vigour of his constitution was equal,:
in any degree, to the arduous office of governing dominions so
extensive, he had never shunned labour, nor repir*d under fatigue; that now, when his health was broken, and his vigour
exhausted byl;- the orage f an incurable distemper, his growing
infirmities admonished him to retire;- nor was he:so fond of
-reigning, as to retain the sceptre in an impotent hand, which
was no longer- able to protect his subjects, or to render them
happy; thit- instead of a severeign worn out with diseases, and

Before the.conclusion of this introduotion, the Compiler takesthe liberty
to recommer.d to teachers, to exercise their pupils in discovering and eiplaining.the emphatic words, and the proper tones and pauses, of every
portion assigned them to read, previously to their being called out to the

examined, will improve their judgment and taste; prevent the practice
of reading without attention to the subject; and establish a habit otreadily

scarcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accustomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of
youth all the attention and sagacity of maturer years; that if,
(uring the course of a long administration, he had committed
any material error in government, or if, under the pressure of
so many and great affairs, and amidst the attention which he
had been obliged to give to them, he had either neglected or
injured any of his subjects, he now implored their forgiveness;
that, for his part, he should ever retain a grateful sense of
their fidelity and attachment, and would carry the remembrance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his
sweetest consolation, as well as the best reward for all his
services; and in his last prayers to Almighty God, would pour
forth his ardent wishes for their welfare.
Then turning towards Philip, who fell'on his knees and
kissed his father's hand, "If," says he,' I had left you, by my
death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made such large
additions, some regard would have been justly, due to my
memory on that account; but now, when I voluntarily resign
to you What I might have still retained, I miy well expect the
warmest expressions of thanks on your part.  With these,
however, I dispense; and shall consider your concern for the
welfare of your subjects, and your love of them, as the best
and most acceptable testimony of your gratitude to me. It
is in your power, by a wise and virtuous administration, to
justify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my
paternal affection, and to demonstrate that you are worthy of
the confidence which I repose in you.  Preserve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Ca;tholic faith in its purity;'let the laws of your country be sacred in your eyes;
encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and
if the time shall ever come, when you shall wish to enjoy the
trawnqiflf:~?:  vate life, may you have a son endowed with
such qualti'es, that you can resign your sceptre to him, with
as much satisfaction as I give up mine to you."
As soon as Charles had finished this long address to his
sibjects, aad to their new sovereign, he sunk into the chair,
exhausted. and ready to faint with the fatigue of so extraordi,
nary an effort.  During his discourse, the whole audience
melted into tears; some from admiration of his magnanimity;.others softened by the expressions of tesderness towards his
son, and'of love to his people; and all were affected with the
deepet: sorrow, at losing a sovereign, who had distinguished
the Netherlands, his native, ountry, with particular marlis of
his regard and attachment,SECTION XXVII.
The same subject continued.
A FEW weeks after the resignation of the Netherlands,
Charles, in an assembly no less splendid, and with a ceremonial
equally pompous, resigned to his son the crowns ofi Spain, with
all the territories depending on them, both in the old and in
the new world. Of all these vast possessions, he re'served
nothing for himself, but an annual pension of a hundred thousand crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford
him a small sum for acts of beneficence and charity.
Nothing now remained to detain him from that retreat for
whi.h he languished.  Every thing having been prepared
some time for his voyage, he set out for Zuitburgh in Zealand.
where the fleet had orders to rendezvous. In his way thither,
he passed through Ghent: and after stopping there a few days,
to indulge that tendet and pleasing melancholy, which arises
in the mind of every man in the decline of life, on visiting the
place of his nativitv, and viewing the scenes and objects familiar to him in his early youth, he pursued his journey, accompanied by his son Philip, his daughter the arch-duchess,
his sisters the dowager queens of France and Hungary, Maximilian his son-in-law, and a numerous retinue.of the Flemish
nobility. Before he went on board; he dismissed them, witl
marks of his attention or regard; and taking leave of Philip
with all the tenderness of a father who embraced his son for
the last time, he set sail under convoy of a large fleet of Spanish, Flemish, and English ships.
His voyage was prosperous and agreeable; and he arrived
at Laredo in Biscay, on the eleventh day after he left Zealand.
As soon as he landed, he fell prostrate on the ground; and
considering himself now as dead to the world, he.kissed the~earth, and said, " Naked came I out of my mother's womb,
and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of mankind." From Laredo he proceeded to Valladolid. There he
took a last and tender leave of his two sisters; whom he would,
not permit to accompany him to his solitude, though they entreated it with tears: not only that they might have the consolation of contributing, by their attendance.and care, to mitigate or to sooth his sufferings, but that they might reap in.str'uction and benefit, by joining with him in those pious exercises, to which he had consecrated,the remainder of hi -ays.
From Valladolidi he continued his journey to Plaxencia in
Estremadura.  He had passed throegh that city a great many
(A.-IP. 9.
173180'TiTe English, Reader.          i'art 1'
years before; and having been struck at that time with the
delightful situation of the monastery of St. Justus, belonging
to the order of St. Jerome, not many miles distant from tilat
place, he had then observed to some of his attendants, that this
was a spot to which Dioclesian might have retired with pleasure.  The impression had remained so strong on his -mind,
that he pitched upon it as the place of his retreat. It was
seated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a small brook,
and surrounded by rising grounds, covered with lofty trees.
From the nature of the soil, as well as the temperature of the
climate, it was esteemed the most healthful aniid delicious situation in Spain.  Some months before his resignation, he had
sent an-architect thither, to add a new apartment to the monastery, for his accommodation;- but he gave strict orders that
the style of the building should be such as suited his present
station, rather than his former dignity.  It consisted only of
six rooms, four -of them in the form of friars' cells, with naked
walls; the other two, each twenty feet square, were hung with
brown cloth, and furnished in the most simple manner.  They
were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one side
into a garden, of which Charles himself had given the plan,
and had filled it with various plants, which he proposed to
cultivate with his own hands.  On the other side, they communicated with the chapel of the monastery, in which he was
to perform his devotions. Into this humble retreat, hardly
sufficient fobr the comfortable accommodation of a private
gentleman, did Charles enter, with twelve domestics only.
He buried there, in solitude and silence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all those vast projects, which, during half
a century, had alarmed and agitated Europe; filling every
kingdom in it, by tulrns, with the terror of his arms, and the
~:   dread of being subjected to his power.
In this reti'rement, Charles formed such a plan of life for
himself, as would have suited the condition of a private person
of a moderate fortune. His table was neat but plain; his domestics few; his intercourse with them familiar; all the cumbersome and ceremonious forms of attendance on his person
were entirely abolished, as destructive of that social ease and
tranqtiillity, whicli he courted, in order to sootl the remainder of his days.  As the mildness of the climate, together with
his deliverance from the burdens and cares of governument,
procured bhmi, rat fir~t, a considerable remission from the acute
pains with which he had been long tormented, he enjoyed,
perhaps, more c6mplete satisfaction in this humble solitude,Ch}ap. 9.    -&gt;' Promzscuous Pieces.                   181
than all his grandeur had e'ver yielded him. The ambitious
thqughts and projects which had so long engrossed and disquieted him, were quite effaced from his miItd. Far from
taking any part in the political transactions of the princes of
Eurodpe, he restrained his curiosity even from any inquiry concerning them; and he seemed to view the busy scene which
he had abandoned, with all the contempt and indiiference
arising from his thorough experience of its vanity, as well as
from the pleasing reflection of having disentangled himselft
from its cares,                            DR. ROBERTSONPIECES IN POETRY

Which first inspired the flame, decays.'Tis gentle, delicate, and kind,
To faults compassionate, or blind;

An idle summer life, in fortune's shine,

Behind, and strikes them from the book of life,
Beneficence its own reward.

Virtiue the best treasure..
Virtue, the strength and beauty of the soul,
Is the best gift of Heav'n: a happiness
That, even above the smiles and frowns of fate,
Exalts great nature's favourites: a wealth
That ne'er encumbers; nor to baser hands
Can be transferr'd. It is the only good
Man justly boasts of, or can call his own.
Riches are oft by guilt and baseness earn'd.
But for one end, one much-neglected use,
Are riches worth our care; (for nature's wants
Are few, and without opulence supp!~ed;)
This noble end is to produce the soul;
To show the virtues in their fairest light;
And make humanity the minister
Of bounteous Providence.

The bears and the bees.
As two young bears, in wanton mood,
Forth issuing from a neighbouring wood,
Came whdre th' industrious bees had stor'd,
In artful cells, their luscious hoard;
O'erjoy'd they seiz'd, with eager haste,
Luxurious on the rich repast.
Alamn'd at this, the little crew
About their ears vindictive flew.
The beasts, unable to sustain
Th' unequal combat, quit the plain;
Half-blind with rage, clnd mad wvith pain
Their native shelter they regain;
There sit, and now, discreeter grown,
Too late their rashness they, bemoan;
And this by dear experience gain.
That pleasure's ever bought with pain.
So when the gilded baits of vice
Are plac'd before our lonrging eyes,
With greedy haste we snatch our fill,
And swallow down the latent ill:
But when experience opes our eyes,
Away the fancied pleasure -lies.
It flies, but oh! too late we find,
It leaves a real sting behind.-M--ERaa

The nightingale and the glow-wvorm.
A NIGHTINGALE, that all day long
Had cheer'd the village with his song,
Nor yet at eve his note suspended,'
Nor yet when eventide was ended,
Began to feel,`as well he might,
The keen demands of appetite;
When, looking eagerly around,  
He spied far off, upon the ground,
A something shining in the dark,
-And knew the glow-worm by his spark.
So, stooping down from hawthorn top,
He thought to'put him in his crop.
The worm, aware of hls-intent,
Harangued him thus, right eloquent-'Did youl admire my lamp,' quoth he,'As much as I your minstrelsy,
You would abhor to do me wrong,
As much as I to spoil your song;
For'twas the self-same pow'r divine,
Taught yow to sing, and me to shine;
That you with music, I with light,
Might beautify and cheer the night.'
The songster heard his short oration,
And, warbling out his approbationr,
Releas'd him, as my story tells,
And found a supper somewhere else.
Hence, jarring sectaries may learn
Their real int'rest to discern;
That brother should not war with brother,
And worry and devour each other:
But sing and shine by sweet consent,
Till life's poor transient night is spent;
Respecting, in each other's case,'The gifts of nature and of grace.

Who studiously make peiace their.;m:

The trials of virtue.
PLA,C'D on the vserge of youth, my mind
Life's op'ning scene survey'd:
I view'd its ills of various kind,
Afflicted and afraid.
But chief my fear the dangers mov'd
That virtue's path enclose:
My heart the wise pursuit approvrd;
But O, what toils oppose!
For see, ah see! while yet her ways
With doubtful step I tread,
A hostile world its terrors raise,
Its snares delusive spread.
O how shall I, with heart prepar3d,'
Those terrors learn to meet?
How, from the thousand snares to guard
My unexperienc'd feet?
As thus I mus'd, oppressive sleep
Soft o'er my temples drew
Oblivion's veil.-The wat'ry deep,
An object strange and new,
Before me rose: on the wide shore
Observant as I stood,
The gathering storms around me roar
And heave the boiling flood
Near and more near the billows rise;
Ev'n now my steps they lave;
And death to my affrighted eyes
Appreach'd in every wave.
What hope, or whither to retreat!
Each nerve at once unstrung;
Chill fear had fctter'd fast my feet,
And chain'd my speechless tongue.
I felt my heart wvithin me die;
*Whei sudden ta mine ear
A,voice, descending from on high,
Reprov'd my erring fear.

Each anxious doubt exclude:

Its just restraint to give;

And faithful to relieve.

To curb the steei, and guide the wheel;
4   And as he pass'd the gazing throng,
With graceful ease, and smack'd the thong,
The idiot wonder they express'd,
Was praise and transport to his breast.
At length, quite vain, he needs would show
His master what his art could do;
And bade his slaves the chariot lead
To Academus' sacred shade.
The trembling grove confess'd its fright,
The wood-nymphs started at the sight,
The- muses drop the learned lyre,
And to their inmost shades retire.
Howe'er, the youth, witj forward air;
Bows to the sage, and mounts the car.
The lash resounds, the coursers spring,
The chariot marks the rolling ring;
And gath'ring crowds, with eager eyes,
And shonts, pursue him as he flies.
Triumphant to the goal return'd,
With nobler thirst his bosom burn'd;
And now along th' indented plain
The self-same track he marks- again,
Pursues with care the nice design,
Nor ever deviates from the line.

Now came still ev'ning on, and twilight gray

Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,
They to their grassy couch, these to their nests
Were slunk; all but the wakeful nightingale.

Silence was pleas'd. - Now glow'd the firmament

Sweet is the breath of morn, Iher rising sweet,
With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun
When first.on this delightful land he spreads
His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flow'r,
Glist'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth
After soft show'rs; and sweet tlhe coming on
0O grateful evening mild; then silent night,
With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,
And these the gems of heav'n, her starry train:
But neither breath of morn, when she ascends
With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun
On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flow'r,
Glist'ring with dew; nor fragrance after show'rs:;
Nor grateful evening mild; nor silent night
With this her solemn bird; nor walk by moon,
Or glitt'ring star light,-without thee is sweet.
But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom
This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes I?"
To whom our gen'ral ancestor reply'd:
"Daughter of G6d and man, accomplish'd' Eve,
These have their course to finish round the earth
By morrow ev'ning-; and from land to land,
In order, though to nations yet unborn,
Minist'ring light prepar'd, they set and rise;
Lest total darkness should by night regain
Her old possession, and extinguish life
In nature and all things; which these soft fires
Not only enlighten, but, with kindly- heat
Of various influence, foment and warm,
Temper or nourish; or in part shed-down
Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
On earth, made hereby -apter to receive-Perfection from the sun's more potent ray.
These; then, though unbeheld in deep of night,
Shine, not in vain; nor think, though men were-toone,
That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise;
Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep.
All these with ceaseless praise his works,behold,
Both day and night.  How -often, from the steep
Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
Celestial. voices  to the midnight air,200                   7The English Reader.          Part 2.
Sole, or responsive each to cthers' note,
Singing their great Creator? Oft in bands,
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk
With heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds,
In full harmonic number join'd, their songs
Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heav'n.t'
Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd
On to their blissful bow'r.  - -
--  There arriv'd, both stood,
Both turn'd; and under open sky-ador'd
The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heav'n,  
Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe,And starry pole  " Thou also mad'st the night,
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day,
Which we, in our appointed work employ'd,
Have finish'd, happy in our mutual help,
And inutual love, the crown of all our bliss
Ordain'd by thee; and this delicious place
For us too large, where thy abundance wants
Partakers, aind uncropt falls to the ground.
But thou hast promis'd from us two a race,
To fill the earth, who shall with us extol
Thy goodness infinite, both when we wyake,
And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep."--MILTON.

Religion and Death.
Lo! a form divinely bright
Descends, and bursts upon my sight;
A seraph of illustrious birth!
(Religion was her name on earth;)
Supremely sweet her radiant face,
And blooming with celestial grace
Three shining cherubs form'd her train,
"Wav'd their light wings, and reach'd the plain:.raith, with sublime and piercing eye,
And pinions flutt'ring for the sky;
Here Hope, that stniling angel stands,
And golden anchors grace her hands;
There Charity in robes of white,    t
Fairest and fav'rite maid of light.
The seraph spoke-,"'Tis Reason's part;
To goverq and to guard the heart;Lhap. 2.              VYJarrative piecee.               2(
To lull the wayward soul to rest,
When hopes and fears distract the breast.
Reason may calm this doubtful strife,
And steer thy bark through various life:
But when the storms of death are nigh,
And midnight darkness veils the sky,
Shall Reason then direct thy sail,
Disperse the clouds, or sink the gale?
Stranger, this skill alone is mine,
Skill that transcends his scanty line."
"Revere thyself-thou'rt near allied
To angels on thy better side.
How various e'er their- ra-nks or kinds,
Angels are but unbodied minds ~
When the partition-walls decay,
Men emerge angels from their clay.
Yes, when the frailer body dies,
The soul asserts her kindred skies.
But minds, though sprung from heav'nly race,
Must first be tutor'd for the place:
The joys above are understood,
And relish'd only by the good.
Who shall assume this guardian care;
Who shall secure their birth-right there?
Souls are my charge-to me'tis giv'n
To train them for their native heav'n."
" Know then-who bow the early knee,
And give the willing heart to me;
Who wisely, when Tempation waits,
Elude her frauds, and spurn her baits,;
Who dare to own my injur'd cause,
Though fools deride my sacred laws;
Or scorn to deviate to the wrong,
Though perseculfi0n lifts her thong;
Though all the sons of hell conspire'
To raise the stake and light the fire;
Know, that for such superior souls,
There lies a bliss beyond the poles:
Where spirits shine with purer rayv
And brighten to meridian day;
Where love, where bojundless friendship rules;
(No friends that change, no love that cools;)
Where rising floods of knowledge r0ll,:;~?-   And pour. and pour upon the soul!"202                  Thle English Reader          Part 2
"But where's the passage to the skies?-.  
The road through death's black valley lies,
Nav do not shudder at my tale;
Tho' dark' the shades, yet safe the vale.  
This path the best of men have trod;
And who'd decline the road to God?
Oh!'tis a glorious boon to die!
This favour can't be priz'd too high."
While thus she spoke, my looks express'd
The raptures kindling in my breast;
My. soul a fix'd attention gave;
When the stern monarch of the grave,
With haughty strides approach'd:-amaz'd
I stood, and trembled as I gaz'd.
The seraph calm'd each anxious fear,
And kindly wip'd the falling tear;
Then hasten'd with expanded wing
To meet the pale, terrific king.
1But now what milder scenes arise!
The tyrant drops his hostile guise;
He seems a youth divinely fair,
In graceful ringlets waves his hair;
His wings their whit'ning plumes display,
His burnish'd plumes reflect the day;
Light flows his shining azure vest,
And all the angel stands confess'd.
I view'd the change with sweet surprise; -
And, Oh! I panted for the skies:
Thank'd heav'n, that e'er I drew my breath;
And triumph'd in the thoughts of death.--coTTQON

On pride.
OF all the causes, which conspire to blind
Man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind,
What th weak head with strongest bias rules,
is:pride, the never-failing vice of fools.
Whatever- natre has in worth deny'd,
iShe gives in large recruits of needfuil pride!
For, as in bodies,7-thus in souls, we find'What wants;in blood and spirits, ~well'd with wind.204                 The English Reader.              Part
Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,
And fills up all the mighty void of sense.
If once right reason drives that cloud away,
Truth breaks upon us with resistless day.
Trust not yourself; but, your defects to knows
Make use of ev'ry friend-and ev'ry foe.
A little learning is a dangerous thing;
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:
There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain;
And -drinking largely sobers us again.
Fir'd at first sight with what the muse imparts,
In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts,
While, from the bounded level of our mind,
Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;
But more advanc'd, behold, with strange surprise,
New distant scenes of endless science rise!
So, pleas'd at first the tow'ring Alps we try,
Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky;
Th' eternal snows appear already past,
And the first clotuds and mountains seem the last   
But, those attain'd, we tremble to survey
The growing labours of the lengthen'd way;
Th' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes;
Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise.-PoPE.

Cruslty to brutes censured.
I WOvLD not enter on my list of friends,
(Though grac'd with polish'd manners and fine sense,
Yet wanting sensibility,) the man
Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.
An inadvertent step may crush the snail,
That crawls at evening in the public path i
But he that has humanity, forewarn'd,
Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.
The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,
And charg'd perhaps with venom, that intrudes
A-vieiter utnwelcome into scenes
Sacred to neatness and repose, th' alcove,
The chamber, or refectory, may die.
A necessary act incurs no blaife.
Not so, when held within their proper bounds,
And guiltless of offence they range the-air,
Or take. their pastime i'a the spacious field.;Clap. 3.               Didactic Pieces.                  so5
There they are privilegd.  And he that hunts
Or harms them there, is guilty of a wrong;
Disturbs th' economy of nature's realm,
Who when she form'd, design'd them an abode.
The sum is this: if man's convenience, health,
Or safety, interfere, his rights and claims,
Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs.
Else they are all-the meanest things that are,
As free to live and to enjoy that life,
As God was free to form them at the first,
Who, in his sovereign wisdom, made them all.
Ye, therefore, who love mercy, teach your sons
To love it too. The spring time of our years
Is soon dishonour'd and defil'd, in most,
By budding ills, that ask a prudent hand
To check them. But, alas! nWiae sooner shoots
If unrestrain'd, into luxuriant growth,
Than cruelty, most dev'llsh of them all.
Mercy to him that shows it, is the rule
And righteous limitation of its act,
By which heav'n moves in pard'ning guilty man:
And he that shows none, being ripe in years,
And&lt;conscious of the outrage he commits,
Shall seek it, and not find it in his turn.-c--OWVPER.

And thus he rais'd from earth the drooping- heart.
"Think not, when all your scanty stores afford,
Is spread at once upon the sparing board;
Think not, when worn the homely robe appears,
While on the roof the howling temnpest bears;
What farther shall this feeble lifes sustain,
And what shall clothe these shiv'ring limbs again.
Say, does not life its nourishment exceed?
And the fair body its investing weed?
Behold! and look away your low despair--

To them, nor stores, nor granaries, belong;
Nought, but the woodland, and the pleasing song;
Yet, your kind heav'nly Father bends his eye
On the least wing that flits along the sky.
To him they sing when spring renews the plain;
To him they cry, in winter's pinching reign;
Nor is their music, nor their plaint in vain:
He hears the -gay, and the distressful call;
And with unsparing bounty fills them all."
" Observe the rising lily's snowy grace;
Observe the various vegetable race:
They neither toil, nor spin, but careless grow;
Yet see how warm they blush!!how bright they glow!
What reg;al vestments can with them compare!
What king so shiling! or what queen so fair!"
" Ift' ceaseless, thus, the fowls of heav'n he feeds;
If o'er the fields such lucid robes he spreads;
Will ihe not care ibr you, ye faithless, say?

2The death of a good mnan a strong incentive to virtue.
THE chamber where the good man meets his fate,
Is privileg'd beyond the common walk
Of virtuous life, quite in the verge of heav'n.
Fly, ye profane! if not, draw near with awe,
Receive the blessiing, and adore the chance,
That threw in this Bethesda your disease':
If unrestor'd by this, desDair your cure.
For, here, resistless demonstration dwells;
A death-bed's a detector of the heart.
Here tir'd dissimulation drops her mask,
Thro' life's grimace, that mistress of the scene  
Here real, and apparent, are the same.
You see the man; you-see his hold on heav'n,
If sound his virtue, as Philander's sound.
Heav'n waits not the last moment; owns her friends
On this side death; and points them out to men;
A lecture, silent, but uof sov'reign pow'r!
To vice, confusion: and to virtue, peace.
Whatever farce the boastful hero plays,
Virtue alone has majesty in death;
-And greater still, tte more the tyrant frowns.-YOUNG,.OL7
SECTION VII.
Reflections on a future state, from a review of w;inter.'Tis done! dread winter spreads his latest glooms,
And reigns tremendous o'er the conquer'd year.
How dead the vegetable kingdom  lies!
How dumb the tuneful! Horror wide extends
His desolate domain.  Behold, fond man!
See here thy pictur'd life: pass some few years,
Thy flow'ring spring, thy summer's ardent strength,
Thy sober autumn fading into age,
And pale concluding winter comes at last,
And shuts the scene.  Ah! whither now are fled
Those dreams of greatness? those unsolid hopes
Of happiness? those longings after fame?
Those restless cares? those busy bustling days?
Those gay-spent, festive nights? those veering thoughts.
Lost between good and ill, that shar'd thy life?
All now are vanish'd! Virtue sole survives
Immortal, never-failing friend of man,
His guide to happiness on high.  And see!'Tis come, the glorious morn! the second birth
Of heav'n and earth! awak'ning nature hears
The new-creating word;. and starts to life,
In ev'ry heighten'd form, from pain and death
For ever free.  The great eternal scheme,
Involving all, and in a perfect whole
Uniting as the prospect wider spreads,
To reason's eye refin'd clears up apace.
Ye vainly wise! Ye blind presumptuous! now,
Confounded in the dust, adore tliat Power,
And Wisdom- oft arraign'd: see now the cause
Why unassuming worth in secret liv'd,
And died neglected: why the good man's share
In life was gall, and bitterness of soul:
Why the lone widow and her orphans pin'd
In starving solitude, whle luxury,
In palaces lay straining her low thought,
To form unreal wants: why heav'n-born truth,
And iiioderation fair, wore t:e red marks
Of superstition's scourge: why licens'd pain,
That cruel spoiler, that embosom'd foe,
Imbitter'd all our bliss. Ye good distress'd.

SECTION VIII.
Adam's advice to Eve, to avoid temptation.
O woMAN, best are all things as the will -
Of God ordain'd them; his creating hand
Nothing imperfect or deficient left
Of all that he created, much less man,
Or aught that might his happy state secure,
Secure from outward force. Within himself
The danger lies, yet lies within-his pow'r:4
Against his will he can receive no harm.
But God left free the will; for what obeys
Reason, is free, and reason he made right;
But bid her well beware, and still erect,  
Lest, by some fair appearing good surpris'd,
She dictate false, and misinform the will
To do what God expressly hath forbid.
Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins
That I should mind thee oft: and mind thou me.,
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,
Since reason not impossibly mav meet    "
Some specious object by the foe suborn'd,
And fall into deception unaware,
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warn'd.
Seek not temptation then, which to avoid
Were better, and most likely if from me
Thou sever not; trial will come unsought.
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy? approve
First thy obedience; th' other who can know,
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
But if thou think, trial unsought may find
Us both securer than thus warn'd thou seem'st,
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more:
Go in thy native innocence; rely
On what thou hast of virtue, summon all;
For God towards thee hath done his part; do thine."

SECTION IX.
On procrastination.
BE wise to-day;'tis madness to defer:
Next day the fatal precedent will plead;
Thus on, till wisdom is push'd out of life.
Procrastination is the thief of time.
Year after year it steals, till all are fled;
And, to the mercies of a moment leaves
The vast concerns of an eternal scene.
Of man's miraculous mistakes, this bears
The palm, "That all men are about to live:"
For ever on the brink of being born.
All pay themselves the compliment to think,
They, one day, shall not drivel; and their pride
On this reversion takes up ready praise;
At least, their own; their future selves applauds;
How excellent that life they ne'er will lead!
Time lodg'd in their own hands is folly's vails;
That lodg'd in fate's, to wisdom they consign;
The thing they can't but purpose, they postpone.'Tis not in folly, not to scorn a fool;
And scarce in human wisdom to do more.
All promise is poor dilatory man;
And thatr thro' ev'ry stage. When young, indeed,
In full content, we sometimes nobly rest,
Unanxious for ourselves; and only wish,
As duteous sons, our fathers were more wise.
At thirty, man suspects himself a fool;
Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan;
At fifty, chides his-infamous delay;
Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve;
In all the magnanimity of thought,
Resolves, and re-resolves, then dies the same.And why? Because he thinks himself immortal.
All men think all men mortal, -but themselves;
Themselves, when some alarming shock of fate
Strikes thro' their wouided hearts the sudden dread:
But their hearts wounded, like the wounded air,
Soon close; where, past the. shaft, no trace is foud
As from the wing no scar the sky ietains;
The parted wave no furrow from the keel;
So dies in human hearts the thought of death.t

That philosophy, which stops at secondary causes, reproved.
HAPPY the man who sees a God employ'd
In all the good and ill that checker life!
Resolving all events, with their effects
And manifold results, into the will
And arbitration wise of the Supreme.
Did not his eye rule all things, and intend
The least of our concerns; (since from the least
The greatest oft originate;) could chance
Find place in his dominion, or dispose
One lawless particle to thwart his plan;
Then God might be surpris'd, and unforeseen
Cpntingence might alarm him, and disturb
The smooth and equal course of his affairs.
This truth, philosophy, though eagle-ey'd
In nature's tendencies, oft o'erlooks;
And having found his instrument, forgets
Or disregards, or; more presumptuous still,
Denies the pow'r that wields it. God proclaims
His hot displeasure against foolish men
That live an atheist life; involves the heav'n
In tempests; quits his grasp upon the winds,
And gives them all their fury; bids a plague
IKindle a fiery boil upon the skin,
And putrefy the breath of blooming health'
He calls for famine, and the meagre fiend
Blows mildew from between his shrivel'd lips,
And taints the golden ear; he springs his mines
And desolates a nation at a blast:
Forth steps the spruce philosopher, and tells
Of homogeneal and discordant springs
And principles; of causes, how they work
By necessary laws their sure effects,
Of action and re-action. He has found
The source o'. the disease- that nature feels;
And bids the worla take heart and banish fear.
Thou fooi! will thy discov'ry of the cause
Sulspend th' effect, or heal it? Has not God
Still wrought by means since first he made the world?
And did he not of vtd emyloy his means(hap. 3.              Didactic Pieces.     -            211
To drown it? What is his creation less
Than a- capacious reservoir of means,
Forrn'd for his use, and ready at his will?

There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart;
It does not feel for man.  The nat'ral bond
Of brotherhood is sever'd, as the flax
That falls asunder at the touch of fire.
He finds his fellow guilty of a skin
Not colour?d like his own; and having pow'r
T' enforce the wrong,- for such a wortkly cause
Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.
Lands intersected by a narrow frith
Abhor each other.  Mlountains interpos'd,
Make enemies of nations, who had else,
Like kindred drops, been mingled into one.
Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;
And worse than all, and most to be deplor'd,     i
As human nature's broadest, foulest blot,
Ch-ainshim, and tasks hin, and exacts ]iswJ --'- Ith stripes, that mercy, with a bleeding heart,
WVeeps when she sees inflicted on a beast.
Then what ii man! And what man seeing this,
And having human feelings,-does not blush
And hang his head, to think himself a man?
I would not have a slave to till my ground,
To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,
And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth
That sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd.
No: dear as freedom is, and in my heart's
Just estimation priz'd above all price;212                 The English Reader.             Part 2,
I had much rather be myself the slave,
And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.
We have no slaves at-home--then why abroad?
And they themselves once ferried o'er the wave
That parts us, are emancipate and loos'd.
Slaves cannot breathe ir. England: if their lungs
Receive our air, that moment they are free;
They touch our country, and their shackles fall.
That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud
And jealous obfthe blessing. Spread it then,
And let it circulate through ev'ry vein
Of all your empire; that where Britain's power
h felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.-C-owPEr.

T'i  meek-ey'd morn appears, mother of dews,
At first faint gleaming in the dappled east;
Till far o'er ether spreads the wid'ning glow;
And from before-the lustre of her face
White break the clouds away. With-quicken'd step  
Brown night retires: young day pours in apace,
And opens all the lawny prospect wide.

Swell on the sight, and brighten with the dawn.

NOR rural sights alone, but rural sounds
Exhilarate the spirit, and restore
The tone of languid nature.  Mighty winds,,

And lull the spirit while they fill the mind,c
Unnumber'd branches waving in the blast,
And all their leaves fast ffutt'ring all at once.
Nor less composure waits upon the roar
Of distant floods; or on the softer voice
Of neighb'ring fountain; or of rills that slip
Through the cleft rock, and, chiming as they fall
TUpon loose pebbles, lose themselves at length
In matted grass, that, with a livelier green,
Betrays the secret of their silent course.

THE rose had been wash'd, just wash'd in a shower,
W hich MIary to Anna convey'd;
The plentifiul moisture encumber'd the flower,
And weigh'd down its beautiful head.
lThe cup was all fill'd, and the leaves were all wet,'And it seem'd to a fancifiul view,
To weep for the buds it had left with regret,
On the flourishing bush where it grew.
I hastily seiz'd it, unfit as it was
For a nosegay, so dripping and drown'd  
And swinging it rudely, too rudely, alas!
I snapp'd it-it fell to the ground.
And such, I exclaim'd, is the pitiless part,
Some act_ by the delicate mind,
Regardless of wringing and breaking a heart,
Already to sorrow resign'd.
This elegant rose, had I shaken it less,
Might have bloom'd with its owner awhile  
And the tear that is wip'd with a little address,
May be follow'd perhaps by a smile.-cowrER.

Liberty and slavery contrasted.   Part of a letter written
jrom Jialy by Addison.
How has kind Heav'n adorn'd the happy land,
And scatter'd blessings with a wasteful hand!
But what avail her un exhausted stores,
Tier blooming moun tains, and her sunny shores,
With all the gifts that heav'n and earth impart,
The smiles of nature, and the charms of art,
While proud oppression in her valleys reigns,
And tyranny usurps her happy plains?`
The poor inhabitant beholds in vain
The redd'ning orange, and the swelling grain;
Joyless he sees the growing oils and wines,
And in the mnyrtle's fragrant shade repines.
Oh, Liberty, thou pow'r supremely bright,
Profuse of bliss, and pregnant with delight!
Perpetual pleasures in thy presence reign;
And smiling plenty leads thy wanton train.
Eas'd of her load, subjection grows more light';
And poverty looks cheerfil in thy sight.
Thou mak'st the gloomy face of nature gay;
Giv'st beauty to the sun, and pleasure to the day.
On foreign mountains, may the sun refine
The grape's soft juice, and mellowrit to wine;
With citron groves adorn avdistant soil,
And the fat olive swell with floods of oil:
We envy not the warmer ciime, that lies
In ten degrees of more indulgent skies;
Nor at the coarseness of our- heav'n repine,
Tho' o'er our heads the frozen Plciads shine:'Tis Liberty that crowns Britannia's isle,
An:Aakes her barren rocks, and her bleak mountains smile,SECTION VI.
Charity. 3 paraphrase on the 13th chapter of the first
epistle to the Corinthians.
-DID sweeter sounds adorn my flowing tongue,
Than ever man pronounc'd or angel sung;
Had I all knowledge, human and divine,
That thought can reach, or science can define';
And had I pow'r to give that knowledge birth,
In all the speeches of the babbling earth;
Did Shadrach's zeal my glowing breast inspire,
To weary tortures, and rejoice in fire;
Or had I faith like that which Israel saw,
When Moses gave them miracles, and law:
Yet, gracious charity, indulgent uest,
Were not tihy pow'r exerted in my breast;
Those speeches would send up unheeded pray'r;
That scorn of life would be but wild despair;
A cymbal's sound were better than my voice;
lMy faith were form; my eloquence were noise.
Charity, decent,' modest, easy, kind,
Softens the high, and rears the abject mind;
Knows, with just reins, and gentle hand, to guide
B3etwixt vile shame, and arbitrary pride.
Not soon provok'd, she easily forgives;
And much she suffers, as she much believes.
Soft peace she brings wherever she arrives;!
She builds our quiet, as she forms our lives;
Lays the rough paths of peevish nature even;
And opens in each heart a little heav'n.
Each other gift, which God on man bestows,
Its proper bounds, and due restriction kncws;
To one fix'd purpose dedicates its pow'r;
And finishing its act, exists no more.
Thus, in obedience'to what Heav'n-decrees,
Knowledge shall fail, and prophecy shall cease;
But lasting charity's more ample sway,
Nor bound by time, nor subject to decay,
In happy triumph shall for ever live;
And endless good diffuse, and endless praise receive.
As through the artist's intervening grl:.lss,
Outr eye observes the distant planets pass;
A little we discover; but allow,
That more remains unseen, than art can show;   
Part 2,
216So whilst our mind its knowledge would improve,
(Its feeble eye intent on things above,)
High as we may, we lift our reason up,
By faith directed, and confirm'd by hope;
Yet are we able only to survey,
Dawnings of beams, and pronmises of day;
Heav'n's fuller effluence mocks our dazzled sight;
Too great its swiftness, and too strong its light. ~
But soon the mediate clouds shall be dispell'd;
The Sun shall soon be face to face beheld,
In all,his robes, with all l;is glory on,
Seated sublime on his meridian throne.
Then constant faith, and.holy hope shall die,
One lost in certainty, and one in joy:
Whillst thou, more happy pow'r, fair charity,
Triumphant sister, greatest of the three,
Thy office, and thy nature still the same,
Lasting thy lamp, and unconsum'd thy flame,
Shalt still survive
Shalt stand before the host of heav'n confest,
For ever blessing, and for ever blest.-PRIOR.

Picture of a good man.
S0ME angel guide my pencil, while I draw,
What nothing else than angel can exceed,
A man on earth devoted to the skies;
Like ships at sea, wvhile in, above the world.
With aspect tnild, and elevated eye,
Behold him seated on a mount serene,
Above the fogs of sense, and passion's storm:
All the black cares, and tumults of this,life,
Like harmless thunders, breaking at his feet,
Excite his pity, not impair his peace.
Earth's genuine sons, the sceptred, and the slave;
A mingled mob! a wand'ring herd! he sees,
Bewilder'd in the vale; in all unlike!
His full reverse in all! What higher praise  
What stronger demonstration of the right?
The present all their care; the future his
When public welfare calls, or private want,
They give to fame; his bounty he conceals.
Their virtues varnish nature; his exalt.
Mankiad's esteem they court; and Ihis own.

No dignity they find in aught besides.
They triumph in externals, (which conceal
Man's real glory,) proud of an eclipse:
Hlimself too much he prizes to be proud;
And nothing thinks so great in man, as man.
Too dear he holds his int'rest, to neglect
Another's welfare, or his right invade;
Their int'rest, like a lion, lives on prey.
They kindle at the shadow of a wrong;
Wrong he sustains with temper, looks on heav'n,
Nor stoops to think his injurer his foe'
Nought, but what wounds his virtue, wounds his peace.
A cover'd heart their character defends;
A cover'd heart denies him half his praise.
With nakedness his innocence agrees!While their broad foliage testifies their fall!
Their no-joys end, where his full feast begins:  
Itis joys create, theirs murder, future bliss.

Of mortal offspring can attain the height,
Of envy'd life; thoe' only few possess

The breathing marble and the sculptur'd gold,
Beyond the proud possessor's narrow claim,
His tuneful breast enjoys. For him, the spring
Distils her dews, and from the silken gem
Its lucid leaves unfolds: for him, the hand
Of autumn tinges every fertile branch
With blooming gold, and blushed like the morn.
Each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings:
And still new beauties meet his lonely walk,
And loves unfelt attract him.  Not a breeze
Flies o'er the meadow; not a cloud imbibes
The setting sun's effulgence; not a strain
From all tlih tinants of the warbling shade.Ascenid&amp;  but whence his bosom can partake
Fresh pleasure, unreprov'd.  Nor thence partakes
Fresh pleasure only; for tWh attentive mind,By this harmonious action on her powers,
Becomes herself harmonious: wont so oft
In outward things to meditate the charm
Of sacred order, soon she seeks at home,
To find a kindred order; to exert. W,ithin herself this elegance of love,This fidr inspir'd delight; her temper'd pow'rs
Refine at length, and every passion wears
A chaster, milder, more attractive mien.
But if to.ampler prospects, if to gaze
On nature's form, where, negligent of all
These lesser graces, she ass'umes the port
Of that Eternal Majesty that weigh'd
The world's foundations, if to these the mind
Exalts her daring eye; then mightier far
Will be the change,-and nobler. Would the forms
Of servile custom cramp her gen'rous pow'rs?
Would sordid policies, the barb'rous growth
Of ignorance and rapine, bow her down
To tame pursuits, to indolence and fear;
Lo! she appeals to nature, to the winds
And rolling waves, the sun's unwearied course,
The elements and seasons: all declare
For what th~ eternal MAKER has ordain'd
The pow'rs of man: we feel within ourselves
His energy divine  he'tells the heart,
He meant, he made us to behold and love
What he beholds and loves, the general orb
Of life and being; to be great like Him,
Beneficent and active.  Thus the men
Whom nature's works instruct, with God himself
Hold converse; grow familiar, day by day,
Wit?h his conceptions; act upon his plan;
And form to his, the relish of their souls.-xAENSIDE.

Who counting on long years of pleasure here,
Is quite unfurnish'd for the world to come!
In that dread mIoment, how the frantic soul
Raves round the walls of her clay tenement;
Runs to each avenue, and shrieks for help;
But shrieks in vain! How wishfully she looks
On all she's leaving, now no longer hers!
A little longer; yet a little longer;  
O might she stay to wash away her stains;'
And fif her for her passage! Mournful sight!
Her very eyes weep blood; and ev'ry groan
She heaves is big with horror.  But the foe,
Like a staunch murd'rer, steady to his purpose,
Pursues her close, tbho' ev'ry lane of life;
Nor misse~ once the track; but presses on,
Till, forc'd at last to the tremendous verge,
At once she sinks-to everlasting ruin.--R. BLAUr.

Elegy lo pity.
HAIL, lovely pow'r! whose bosom heaves the sigh,
WVVhen fancy paints thq scene of deep distress-;
VWhose tears spontaneous crystallize the eye,
When rigid fate denies the pow'r to bless.
Not all the sweets Arabia's gales`ouvey
From flow'ry meads, can with that sigh compare;
Not dew-drops glitt'ring in the morning ray,
Seem near so beauteous as that falling tear.
Devoid of fear, the fawns around thee play;
Emblem of peace, the dove before thee flies;  
No blood-stain'd traces mark thy blameless way  
B3eneath thy feet   hapless insectwdies.

Come, lovely nymph, and range the mead with me,
To spring the partridge from t'&gt;e guilefil foe;
From secret snares the struggling bird to free;
And stop the hld uprais'd to give the blow.
And when the air with heat meridian glows,
And pature droops beneath the conqu'ring gleam,
Let us, slow wand'ring where tie current flows,
Save sinking flies that float along the stream.
Or turn to nobler, gr6eiter tasks thy care,
To me thy sympathetic gifts impart;
Teach me in frieidship's griefs to bear a share,
And justly boast the gen'rous feeling heart.
Teach me to sooth the helpless orphan's grief;
With timely aid the widow's woes assuage;
To mis'ry's moving cries to yield relie*f;'And be the sure resource of drooping age.

J A sAmonarch of all I survey,
My right there is none to dispute;
From the centre all round to the sea,
I am lord of the fowl and' the brute.
Oh solitude-! where are the charms,
That sages have seen in' thy face?
Better dwell in the midst of alarms,
Than reign in this horrible place.
I am out of humanity's reach,:-"
I must finish my journey alone;
Never hear the sweet music of speech;
I start at the sound of my own.
The beasts that roam over the plain,
My form with indifference see:
They are so unacquainted with man,
-  Their tameness is shocking to meSociety, friendship, and love,
Divinely bestow'd upon man,
Oh had I the wings of a dove,
How soon would I taste you again! i
My sorrows I then might assuage
In the ways of religion asd truth;
Might learn from the wisdom of age,
And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth.
Religion! what treasure untold
Resides in that heavenly word!
M1ore precious than silver or gold,
Or all that this earth can afford.
But the sound of the church-going bell
These vallies and rocks never heard;
Ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell,
Or smil'd when a sabbath appear'd.
Ye winds that-have made mne your sport,
Convey to this desolate shore,
Some cordial endearing report
Of a land I shall visit no more.
My friends, do they now and then send
A wish or a thought after me?
O tell me I yet have a friend,
Though a friend I am never to see.
How fleet is a glance of the mind!
Compar'd with the speed of its flight,
The tempest itself lags behind,
And the swift-wing'd arrows of light.
When I think of my- own native land,
In a moment I seem to be there;
But, alas! recollection ft hand
Soon hurries me back to despair.:   But the sea-fowl is gone to her nest,
The beast is laid down in his lair;
Even here is a season of rest,
And- I'to my cabin repair.
There's mercy in every place;
And mercy-encouraging tlhought:
Gives even affliction a grace,
And reconcil.es man to his lot.-.cowERzn.

Gratitude.
WHEN all thy mercies O0 my God!
My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view, I'm lost
In wonder, love, and praise.
0 how shall words, with equal warmth,
The gratitude declare,
That glows within my ravish'd heart?
But thou canst read it there.
Thy providence my life sustain'd,
And all my wants redfest,
When in the silent womb I lay,
And hung upon the breast.
To all my weak complaints and cries    e
Thy mercy- lent an ear,
Ere yet my feeble thoughts t;ad learn'd
To form themselves in pray'r.
Unnumber'd comforts to my soul
Thy tender care bestow'd,
Before my infant heart conceiv'd
From whom those comforts flow'd.
When, in the slipp'ry paths of youth,'With heedless steps, I ran,
Thine arm, unseen, convey'd me safe,
And led me up to man.
Through hidden dangers, toils, and deaths,
It gently clear'd my way;
And through the pleasing snares of vice,...
More to be fear'd than they.
When wornrwith sickness, oft hast thou,
With health renew'd my face;
And, when in sins and sorrows sunk,
Reviv'd my soul with grace.
Thy bounteous kand, with worldly bliss   
Has made my cup run o'er;
And, in a kind and faithful friend,:Has doubled all my store.

A man perishing in the snow; frodn whence reflections are
raised on the miseries of life.
As thus the snows arise; and foul and fierce,
All winter drives  png the darken'd air;'
In his own loose-revolving field, the swain
Disaster'd stands; sees other hills ascend,
Of unknown joyless brow; and other scenes,
Of horrid prospect, shag the, trackless plain;
Nor finds the river, nor the forest, hid
Beneath the formless wild; but wanders on,
From hill to dik, still more and more astray;
Impatient flouncing through the drifted heaps.
Stung with the thoughts of home; the thoughts of home
Rush on his nerves, and call their vigour forth
In many a vain attempt.  How sinks his soul!
W'hat black despair, what horror fills his heart!
When, for the dusky spot, which fancy feign'd.   si tufted cottage rising through the snow,
He meets the roughness of'the middle waste,
Far from the track, and blest abode of man;
While r:him night resistless closes fast,
And ev',j,teimpest howling o'er his head,
R enders the savage wilderness more wild.
Then throng the busy shapes into his mind,
Of cover'd pits, unfath'bmably deep,
A dire descent, beyond the pow'r of fro!t
Of faithless bogs; of precipices huge;Chap. 5.              Pathetic Pieces.                 2q
Smooth'a up with snow; and what is land, unknown,.
What water, of the still unfrozen spring,
In the loose.marsh or solitary lake,
Where the fresh fountain from the bottom boils.
These check his fearful steps; and down he sinks
Beneath the shelter of the shapeless drift,
Thinking o'er all the bitterness of death,
Mix'd with the tender anguish nature shoots
Through the wrung bosom of the dying man,
His wife, his children, and his friends unseen,
In vain for him th' officious wife prepares
The fire fair-blazing, and the vestment warm;
In vain his little children, peeping out
Into the mingled storm, demand their sire,
With tears of artless innocence; Alas!
Nor wife, nor children, more shall he behold;
Nor friends, nor sacred home. On every nerve
The deadly wintev seizes; shuts up sense;
And, o'er his inmost vitals creeping cold,
Lays him along the enows a stiffen'd corse,
- Stretch'd out and bleaching in the northern blast,
Ah, little think the gay licentious proud,
Whom pleasure, pow'r, and affluence surround;
They who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth,
And wanton, often cruel riot, waste;
Ah little think-they, while they dance along,
How many feel, this very moment, death,
And all the sad variety of pain!
How many sink in the devouring flood,
Or more devouring flame! How many bleed,
By shameful variance betwixt mall and man!
How rmany pine in want, and dungeon glooms,
Shut from the comoan air, and common use
Of their own limbs! How many drink the cup
Of baleful grief, or eat the bitter bread
Of misery! Sore pierc'd by wintry windS,
How many shrink into the sordid hut
- Of cheerless poverty! How many shake
Witlb all the fiercer tortures of the mind,
Unbounded passion, madness, guilt, remorse!
How many, rack'd with honest passions, droop
In deep retir'd distress! How many stand
-Around the death-bed of their dearest friends,
And point the parting anguish! Thought,fond man

Of these, and all the thousand nameless ills,
That one incessant struggle render life,
One scene of toil, of suffering, and of fate,
Vice in his high career would stand appall'd,
And heedless rambling impulse learn to think;
The conscious heart of charity would warm,
And her wide wish benevolence dilate;
The social tear would rise, the social sigh;
And into clear perfection, gradual bliss,
Refining still, the social passions work.-THOMlsoN.

A morning hymn.
THESE are thy glorious woks, parent of good,
Almighty, thine this universal frame,
TLas wond'rous fair; thyself how wond'rous then!
Unspeakable, who sitt'st above these heavens
To us, invisible, or dimly seen
In these thy lower works; yet these declare.
Thy goodness beyond thought, and pow'r divine,
Speak ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,
Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs. And choral symphonies, day without night,
Circle his throne rejoicing; ye, in heaven,
On e6rth, join all ye creatures to extol
Him first, Himnlast, Him midst, and without end.
Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,
If better thou belong not to the dawn,
Sure pledge of day, that crown'st the smiling;morn
With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,
While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.
Thou sun, of this great world, both W  and soul,
Acknowledge him thy greater, sound his praise
In thy eternal c'ourse, both when thou climb'st,
And when high noon hast gain'd, and when thou falls't.
Moon, that now meet'st the orient sun, now fly'st,
With the fix'd stars, fix'd in their orb that flies;
And ye five other waa'dring fires that move
In mystic dance, not without song, resound;
His praise, who out of darkness call'd up light.
Air, and ye elements, the eldest birth
Of nature's womb, that in quaternion run
Perpetpal circle, multiform, and mix
And nouriah all things;'et your deaseless changehap. 6.            Promiscuous Pieces.
Vary to our great MARER still new praise.  
Ye mists and exhalations that now rise
From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,
In honour to the world's great AUTHoR rise  
Whether to deck with clouds th"uncolour'd sky,
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling show'rs;
Rising or falling still advance his praise.
His praise, ye winds, that from four quarters blow
Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye pines;
With ev'ry plant, in sign of worship wave.
Fountains, and ye that warble as ye flow
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
Join voices, all ye living souls; ye birds
That singing, up to heaven's gate ascend,
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;
Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk
The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
Witness if I be silent, morn or even,
To hill or valley, fountain, or fresh shade
Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.
Hail, UNIVERSAL LORD! be bounteous still
To give us only good  and if the night
Has gather'd aught of evil, or conceal'd,
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.--MILTO?&amp;:

The shepherd and the philosopher.
REMOTE from cities liv'd a swain,
Unvex'd with all the cares of gain;
His head was silver'd o'er with age,
And long experience made him sage;
In summer's heat and winter's cold,
He fed his flock and penn'd the fold;
His hours in cheerful labour flew,
Nor envy nor ambition knew:
His wisdom and his honest fame
Through all the country rais'd his name.
A deep philosopher (whose rules
Of moral life were drawn from schools)
The shepherd's homely cottage sought,
And thus explor'd his reach of thought.
"Whence is thy learning? Hath thy toil. O'er books consum'd the midnight oil?
Hast thou old Greece and Rome survey'd,
And the vast sense of Plato weigh'd?
Hath Socrates thy soul refin'd,
And hast thou fathom'd Tully's mind  
Or, like the wise Tlysses, thrown,'By various fates, on realms unknown,
Hast thou through many cities stray'd,
Their customs, laws, and manners weigh'd?"
The shepherd modestly replied,
"I ne'er the paths of learning tried;
Nor have I roam'd in foreign parts,
To read mankind, their laws and arts;
For man is practis'd in disguise,'
He cheats the most discerning eyes.
Who by that search shall wiser grow?
By'that ourselves we never know.
The little knowledge I have gain'd,
Was all from simple natute drain'd;
Hence my life's maxims, took their-.rise,
Hence grew mysettled hate of vic.;

Who can observe the careful ant,
And not provide for future want?
My dog (the trustiest of his kind)
WithQ gratitude inflam#s my mind:
I mark his true, his faithful way,
And in my service copy Tray.
In constancy and nuptial love,
I learn my duty from the dove.
The hen, wsho from the chilly air,
With pious wing, protects her care,
And ev'ry fowl that flies at large,
Instructs me in a parent's charge."'
" From nature too I take my rule,
To shun contempt and ridicule.
I never, with important air,
In conversation overbear.
Can grave and formal pass for wise,
When men the solemn owl despise?
My tongue within my lips I rein;
For who talks much must talk in vain.
We from the wordy torrent fly:
Who listens to the chatt'ring pye?
Nor would I, with felonious flight,
By stealth invade my neighbour's right:
Rapacious animals we hate;
Kites, hawks, and wolves, deserve their fate.
Do not we just abhorrence lind
Against the toad and serpent kind?
But envy, calumny, and spite,
Bear stronger venom in theim bite.
Thus ev'ry'object of creation
Can firnish-hints to contemplation;
And, from the most minute and mean,
A virtuous mindcan morals glean."
Thy flime is junst," the sage replies;'Thy virtue proves thee truly wise.
Pride often guides the author's pen,
Books as affected are as men:
But he who studies nature's laws,
From certain truth his maxims draws;

The road to happiness open to all men.
On happiness! our being's end and aim!
Good, pleasure, ease, content! whate'er thy name;
That something still which prompts th' eternal sigh,
For which we bear to live, or dare to die:
Which still so near us, yet beyond us lies,
O'erlook'd, seen double, by the fool and wisePlant of celestial seed, if dropt below,
Say, in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow?
Fair op'ning to some court's propitious shine,
Or deep with diamonds in the flaming mine?
Twin'd with, the wreaths Parnassian laurels yield,
Or reap'd in iron harvests of the field?
Where grows? where grows it not? if vain our toil,
We ought to blame the culture, not the soil.
Fix'd to no spot-is happiness sincere;'Tis no where to be found, or ev'ry where;'Tis never to be bought, but always free;
And, fled from monarchs, St. John! dwells with thee.
Ask of the learn'd the way. The learn'd are blind;
This bids to serve, and that to shun mankind:
Some place the bliss in action, some in case;
Those call it pleasure, and contentment these:
mome sunk to beasts, find pleasure end in pain;
Some swell'd to gods, confess ev'n virtue vain';  
Or indolent, - to each extreme they fall,
To trust in ev'ry thing, or doubt of all.
Who thus define it, say they more or less
Than this, that happiness is happiness?
Take nature's path, and mad opinions leave;
All states can reach it, and all heads conceive;
Obvious her goods, in no extreme they dwell;
There needs but thinking right, and meaning well;
And mourn our various portions as we;please,
Equal is common sense, and common ease.
Remember, man, "the universal cause
Acts not by partial, but by gen't'al laws;"
And makes what happiness we justly call,
Subsist not in the good of one, but all.-rPorLSECTION IV.

And all my midnight hours defend.
When in the sultry glebe I faint,
Or on the thirsty mountains pant;

Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
Amid the verdant landscape flow.

Or leagues of friendship with his saints renew:

While I long vigils to its Founder keep!'Canst thou not shake the centre? Oh control,
Subdue by force, the rebel in my soul;
Thou, who canst still the raging of the flood,
Restrain the various tumults of my blood;
Teach me, with equal firmness, to sustain
Alluring pleasure, and assaulting pain.
O may I pant for thee in each desire!  
And with strong faith foment the holy fire!
Stretch out my soul in hope, and grasp the prize,
Which in eternity's deep bosom lies!'
At the great day of recompense behold,
Devoid of fear, the fatal book unfold!

From age to age my grateful song repeat;

The pursuit of happiness often ill-directed.

O'er n.ature's soft repose;
No low'ring cloud obscures the sky,--  
Nor ruffling tempest blows.

The throbbing heart lies still;czp.M 6..            Promizscuous -Pteees.
And varying schemes of life no more

In silence hush'd to reason's voice,
Attends each mental pow'r:
Come, dear Emilia, and enjoy
Reflection's fav'rite hour.
Come; while the peaceful scene invites,
Let's search this ample round;
Where shall the lovely fleeting form
Of happiness be found?
Does it amidst the frolic mirth
Of gay assemblies dwell-;
Or hide beneath the solemn gloom,
That shades the hermit's cell?
How oft the laughing brow of joy,A sick'ning heart coeceals!
And, through the cloister's deep recess,
Invadifrg sorrow steals.
In vain, through beauty, fortune, wit,
The fugitive we trace;
It dwells not in the faithless smile
That brightens Clodia's face.
Perhaps the joy to these deny'd,
The heart in friendship finds:
Ah! dear delusion. gay conceit
Of visionary miuds!
Howe'er our varying notions rove,
Yet all agree in one,
To place its being in some state,
At distance from our own.
O blind to each indulgent aim,
Of power supremely wise,
Who fancy happiness in aulght
The hand of Heav'n denies!Vain is alike the joy we seek,
And vain what we possess,
Unless harmonious reason tunes
The passions into peace.
To temper'd wishes. just desires,
Is happiness confin'd;

DEAR Chloe, while the busy crowd,
The vain, the wealthy, and the proud,
In folly's maze advance;
Tho' singularity and pride
Be call'd our choice, we'll-step aside,
Nor joint the giddy datcer
From the gay world, we'll oft retire
To our own family and fire,
Where love our hours employs;
No noisy neighbour enters here,
No intermeddling stranger near,
To spoil our heart-felt joys.
If solid happiness we prize,
Within our breast this jewel lies;
And they are fools who roam:
The world has nothing to bestow;
From our own selves our joys must flow
And that dear hut, our home...
Of rest was Noah's dove bereft,
gWhen with impatient wing she left
That safe retreat, the ark;
Giving her vain exournion o'er,
The disappointed bird once more
Explor'd the sacred bark.
Tho' fools spurn Hymen's gentle pow's,
We, who-improve his golden hours,
L By sweet experience know,
r]hat marriage rightly understood,
Gives to the tender and the good
A paradise below.
Our babes shall richest comfort bring,
If tutor'd right, they'll prove a spring
W hence pleasures ever rise:
We'll form their minds, with studious care,
To all that's'manly, good, and -fair,
And train them for the skies.Ckap. 6.             Promiscuous Pieces.                  41
While they our wisest hours engage,
They'll joy our youth, support our age,
And crown our hoary hairs:
They'll grow in virtue ev'ry day,
And thus our,fondest loves repay,
And recompense our cares.
No borrow'd joys! they're all our own,
While to the world we live unknown,
Or by the world forgot:
Monarchs! we envy not your state;
We look with pity or' the great,
And bless our humbler lot.
Our portion is not large, indeed!
But then how little do we need!
For nature's calls are- few:
In this the art of living lies,
To want no more than may suffice,:
And make that little do.
We'll therefore relish, with content,
Whate'er kind Providence has sent,
Nor aim beyond our pow'r;
For if our stock be very small,'Tis prudence to enjoy it all,
Nor lose the present hour.
To be resign'd, w4en ills betide,
Patient when favours are denied,
And pleas'd with favours giv'n  
Dear Chloe, this is wisdom's part;
This is that incense of the heart,
"Whose fragrance smells to heav'a.
~We'll ask no long protracted treat,
Since winter.life is seldom sweet;
But when our feast is o'er'
Grateful from table we'll arise,
Nor grudge oulr sons, with envious eyes,,
The relics of our store,
Thus, hand in hand, thro' life we'll go  
Its checker'd paths qf joy and wo,
With cautious stelps, we'll tread;
QQuit its vain scenes withlout a tear,
Without a trouble or a fear,
And mingle with the dead.242                 tle English Reader.             Part 4.

Providence vindicated in the present state of man.

All but the page prescrib'd, their present state;
From brutes what men, from men what spirits know:;
Or who could suffer being here below?

And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood.
Oh blindness to the fiuture! kindly giv'n,
That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heav'n;
Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,
A hero perish, or a sparrow fall;
Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,
And now a bubble burst, and now a world.
Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar,
Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore.
What future bliss he gives not thee to know,
But gives that hope to be thy blessing now.
Hope springs eternal in the human breast:
Man never is, buit always To BE blest.
The soul, uneasy, and confin'd from home,
Rests and expatiates in a life to come.
Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind
Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;
His soul proud science never taught to stray,
Far-a-s the Solar Walk or Milky Way;
Yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n,
Behind the cloud-topt bill, a humbler heav'n;
Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,
Some happier island in the wat'ry waste;
Where slhfves onceg more their native land be[ old,

All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies,

For more his pleasures, yet for more his prideq

DILIGENCE, industry, and proper improvement of time,
are material duties of tUS young.
The acquisition of knowledge is one of the most honourable occupations of youth.
Whatever useful or engaging  endowments we  possess,
virtue is requisite, in order to their shining  with  proper
lustre.
Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accomplished and
flourishing manhood.
Sincerity and truth form the basis of every virtue.
Disappointments and distress are often blessings in disguis&amp;,
Change and alteration form the very essence of the world.
True happiness is of a retired nature, and an enemy to
pomnp and noise.
In order to acquire a capacity for;happiness, it must be our

Whate-ver purifies, fortifies also the heart.

Darting through the one-arch'd bridge,
Qulick she dips her dappled wing.

Quiet een the shepherd's cur,
Sleeping on the heath-clad hill.
Languid is the landscape round,
Till the fresh descending show'r,:
Grateful to the thirsty ground,
Raises ev'ry fainting flow'r.
Now the hill-the he,dge--are green,.
Now the warblers' throats in tune;;
Blifhsome is the verdant scene,
Brighten'd by the beams of Noon! I
EVENING.
O'ER the heath the heifer strays;
Free-(the furrow'd task is done;)
Now the village windows blaze,
Burnish'd by the setting sun.
Now he sets behind the hill,
Sinking from a golden sky:
Can the pencil's mimic skill
Copy the refulgent dye?
Trudging as the ploughmen go,
(To the smoking hamlet bound,)
Giant-like their shadows grow
Lengthen'd o'er the level ground.
Where the rising forest spreads
Shelter for the lordly deme!
To their high-built airy beds,
See the rooks returning home!
As the lark, with vary'd tune,.
Carols to the ev'ning loud;
Mark the mild resplendent moon,
Breaking through a parted cloud!'
Now the hermit owlet peeps
From the barn or twisted brake;
And the blue mist slowly creeps,
Curling on the silver lake.
As the trout in speckled, pride,
Playful from its bosom springs;
To the banks a ruffled tide. _erges i s'uccessive rings.

O'er the path-divided dale,
Mark the rose-complexion'd lass
With her well-pois'd milking pail!

And the cuckoo bird with two,
Tuning-sweet their mellow throats,
Bid the setting sun adieu.-cUNNINSGHAM.

The order of nature.
SEP,- thro'.this air, this ocean, and this earth,
All matter'liick, and bursting into birth.
Above, how high progressive life may go!
Around, how wide! how deep extend below:
Vast chain of being! which from God -began,
Nature ethereal, human; angel, man;,  
Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,
No glass can reach;' from infinite to thee,
From thee to nothing.-On superior pow'rs
Were we to press, inferior might on ours;
Or in the full creation leave a void,
Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy'd:
From nature's chain whatever link you strike,
Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.
And, if each system in gradation roll,
Alike essential to th' amazing whole,
The least confusion but in one, not all
That system only, but the whole must fall.
Let earth, unbalanc'd from her orbit fly,
Planets and suns run lawless thro' the sky;
Let ruling angels from their spheres be hurl'd
Being on being wreck'd, and world on world;
Heav'n's whole foundations to their centre nod,
And nature tremble to t- throne of God
All this dread ORDER break-for whom? for thee.
Vile worm!- Oh madnss! pride! impiety!
What if the obot, ordain'd the dust,to tread.,
Or hand, to toil, aspir'd to -be the head?  
What if the head, the eye, or ear repin'd.
To serve mere engines to the ruling mind 9'
Just as absurd for any part to claim
To be another, in this gen'ral frame;56                  1lThe I.&gt;glish Reader.        Part.2.
Just?s absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains,
The great directing MIND OF ALL ordains.
All are but parts of one stupendous whole,
Whose body nature is, an, God the soul:
That, chang'd thro' all, and yet in all the same, I
Great in the earth, as in th' ethereal frame;  
Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,
Glows in the stars, and blossoms iyl the trees;
Lives thro' all life, extends thro' all extent,.
Spreads undivided, operates unspent-,;
Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,
As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;
As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns,
As the rapt seraph that adores and burns:
To him no high no low, no great no small;         -
He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.
Cease then, nor ORDER imperfection name:
Our proper bliss depends on what we blame.
Know thy own point: this kind, this due degree
Of blindness, weakness, Heav'n bestows on thee.
Submit.--In this or any other.sphere,
Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear:
Safe in the hand of one disposing Pow'r,
Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.
All nature is but art, unknown to thee;
All chance, di.ection, which thou canst not see;
-All discord, h'armony not understood;

And, spite of Pride, in erring Reason's spite.
One truth is clear,--WHATEVER IS, IS RIGHT.--P OPe.

Supported by thy care,
Through burning climes I pass'd unhurt~
And breath'd in tainted air.
Thy mercy sweeten'd ev'ry soil,

How with affrighted eyes,
Thou saw'st the wide extended deep

Confusion dwelt in ev'ry face,
And fear in ev'ry heart,

O'ercame the pilot's art.
Yet then, from all my griefs, 0 Lord,
Thy mercy set me free;
While in the confidence of pray'r
My soul took hold on thee.
For tho' in dreadful whirls we hung
High on the broken wave,

Nor impotent to save.
The storm was -laid, the winds retir'd,
Obedient to thy will;
The sea that roar'd at thy command,
At thy command was still.
In midst of dangers, fears, and deaths,
Thy-goodness I'11 adore;
And praise thee for thy mercies past,
And humbly hope for more.

Promiscuouzs Pteces.-24               The English,Reader.               Part I
-A temperate spirit, and moderate expectatlons, are excellent safeguards of the mind, in this uncertain and changing
state.
There is nothing, except simplicity of intention, and purity
of principle, that -can stand the test of near approach and strict
examination.
The value of any possession -is to be chiefly estimated, by
the relief which it can bring us in the time of our greatest
need.
No person who has once yielded lp the government of his
mind, and given loose rein-to his desires and passions, can
tell how far they.may carry him.
Tranquillity of mind is always most likely to be attained,
when the business of the world is tempered with thoughtful
and serious retreat.
He who would act like a wise man, and build his house on
the rock, and not on the sand, should contemplate human life,
not only in the sunshine, but in the shade.
Let usefulness and beneficence, not ostentation and vanity,
direct the train of your pursuits.
To maintain a steady and unbroken mind, amidst all the
shocks of the world, marks a great and noble spirit.
Patience, by preserving composure within, resists the impression w-hich trouble makes from without.
Compassionate affections, even when they draw  tears
from our eyes for human misery, convey satisfaction- to the
heart.
They who have nothing to give, can often afford relief to
others, -by imparting what they feel.
Our ignorance of what is to come, and of what is really
good or evil, should correct anxiety *about worldly sulccess.
The veil which covers from our sight the events of succeeding years,' is a veil woven by the hand of mercy.
The best preparation for all the uncertainties of futurity,
consists in a well-ordered mind, a good conscience, and a
cheerful submission to the will of Heaven.
SECTION II.
THE chief misfortunes that befall- us in life, can be traced
to some vices or follies which we have committed.
Were we to survey the chambers of sickness and distress,
we should often find them peopled with the victmis of intemperance and sensuality, and with the childrenl of vicious in-,
dolence and sloth.T77e English Reader.         P1art 2.
With light and heat refulgent.  Then Thy sun
Shoots full perfection thro' the swelling year;
And oft T'hy voice in dreadful thunder speaks;
And oft at dawn, deep noon, or falling eve,
By brooks and groves, in hollow-whisp'ring gales
Thy bounty shines in autumn unconfin'd,
And spreads a common feast for all that lives.
In winter, awful Thou! with clouds and storms
Around Thee thrown, tempest o'er tempest roll'd,
Majestic darkness! On the whirlwind's wing,
Riding sublime, thou bidst the world adore  
And humblest nature with Thy northern blast.

Yet so delightful mix'd, with such kind art,
Such beauty and beneficence combin'd;.Shade, unperceiv'd, so soft'ning into shade,
And all so forming an harmonious whole,
That as they still succeed, they ravish still.

That, ever busy, wheels the silent spheres-;

O SOLITUDE, romantic maid!
Whether by nodding towers you tread
Or haunrt the desert's trackless gloom,
Or hover o'er the yawning tomb,
Or climb the Andes' clifted side,
Or by the Nile's coy source abide,
Or, starting from your half-yearns sleep
From Hecla view the thawing deep,
Or, at the purple dawn of day,
Tadmor's marble wastes survey;
You, recluse, again I woo,
And again your steps pursue.

Purse-proud elbowing insolence,

Again you to the wild retreat,
And the early huntsman meet,
Where, as you pensive pass along,
Yourcatch the distant shepherd's song,
Or brush from herbs the pearly dew,
Or the rising primrose view,
Devotion lends her heaven-plum'd wings,
You mount, and nature with you sings.
But when mid-day fervours glow,
To upland airy shades you go,
Where never sun-burnt woodman came,
N-or sportsman chas'd the timid game:
And there, beneath an oak reclin'd,
With drowsy waterfalls behind,
You sink to rest.
Till the tuneful bird of night,
Fromn the neighb'ring poplar's height,
Wake you with her solemn strain,
And teach pleas'd echo to complain.

To be wise in our own eyes, to be wise in the opinion of
the world, and to be wise in the sight of vur Creator, are
three things so very different, as rarely to coincide.
Man, in his highest earthly glory, is but a reed floating on
the stream of time, and forced to follow every new direction
of the current.
The corrupted temper, and the guilty passions of the bad,
frustrate the effect of every advantage which the world- confers on them.
-The external misfortunes of life, disappointments, poverty, and sickness, are light in comparison of those inward
distresses of mind, occasioned by folly, by passion, and by
guilt.
No station is so high, no power so great, no character so
umblemished, as to -exempt men from the attacks of rashness,
uialice, or envy.
Moral and religious instruction derives its efficacy, not so
much from what men are taught to know, as from what they
are brought to feel.
He who pretends to great sensibility towards men,.and yet
has no feeling for the high objects of religion, no heart to admire and adore the great Father of the universe, has reason
to distrust the truth and delicacy of his sensibility.
When, upon rational and sober inquiiry, we have established our principles, let us not suffer them. to be shaken by
the scoffs of the licentious, or the cavils of: tbe sceptical.
When we observe antendencv to treat r.aiigionQr morals
with disrespect and levity, let us hold it'to be a sure indication
of a perverted understanding, or a depreaved heart.
Every degree of guilt incurred by yielding to tefnptation,
tends to- debase the mind, and to weaken the generous and
benevolent principles of human nature.  
Luxury, pride, and vanity, have frequently as much influence in corrupting the sentirnenlts of theC great, as ignQo
rance, bigotry, and prejudice, have in misleading the opinions
of the multitude.
Mixed as the present state is, reason and religion, puro'
nounce, that generally, if nlot always, there is mnaore happiless
than misery, more pleasure than pain, in the condition of
man.,
Society, when formed, requires distinctions of property,
diversity of conditions, subordir:ation of ranks, and a multiplicity of occupations, in order to advance the geaera
good.B26                Th.Eingish RMeader           Part 1,
That the temper; the sentiments, the morality, and, in
general, the whole conduct and character of men, are in.
iluenced by the.example and disposition of the persons -with
whom they associate, is a reflection which has. oteig since
iassed into a proverb, and been ranked among the standig
maxims of human wisdom, in all ages of the world.
-  SECTION' III.
THE desire of improvement discovers a hliberal mind, and:
ib connected with many accomplishments, and many virtues.
Innocence confers ease -and freedom on.the mind; an*leaves it open to every pleasing sensation.
Moderatej and smple pleasures relish high with. the temperate: In the midst of his studied refinements, the volup.:
tuary languishes.
Gentleness corrects whatever is offensive in our manners;
and, by a constant train Qf humane attentions,oatudies to alleviate the burden of common misery.
That gentleness which is the characteristic of a good man,
-has, like every other virtue, its seat in the heart: and, let me
add, nothing, except what flows from the heart, can rendar
even external manners truly pleasing.
Virtue, to become either vigorous or nseful, must be
habitually -active - not breaking forth occasionally with a
transient lustre, like the blaze of a comet; but regular in its
returns, like the light- of day: nO# ike the aromatic' gale.
which sometimes feasts the sense;-but like the ordinary
breeze, which purifies the air, and renders it healthful.
The happiness of every man depends more upon the state
of his own mind, than upon any one external circumstance:
nay, more than upon all external things put together.
In no'station, in no period, let as think ourselves secure
from  the dangers which spring from our passions. Everyr
age, and every station they beset; from youth to   y hair,
and from the peasant to the prince.
Riches and pleasures are the chief temptations to'criminal
deeds.  Yet those riches, when obtained, may very possibly
overwhelm us with unforeseen miseries.'-Those pleasures
may cut short our health and life.
He who is accustomed to turn aside from the- *orld, ant
~-ommune with himself in retirement, will, sometimes at
least, hear the. truths which the mnultitude do not tel.

awaken within the heart those latent suggestions, which tle
world had overpowered and suppressed.
Amusement often becomes the business, instead of the relaxation, of young persons: it is then highly pernicious.
He that waits for an opportunity, to do much at once, may
breathe out his life in idle wishes; and regret, in the last
hour, his useless intentions and barren zeal.
The spirit of true religion breathes mildness and affability.
It gives a native, unaffected ease to the behaviour: It is social, kind, and cheerful f:ar removed fromn that gloomy and
illiberal superstition, which clouds the brow, sharpens the
temper, dejects the spirit, and teaches men to fit-themselves
for another world, by neglecting the concerns of this.
Reveal none of the secrets of thy friend.  Be faithful to his
interests.  Forsake him not in danger.  Abhor the thought
of acquiring any advatntage by his prejudice.
Map, always prosperous, would be giddy and insolent; always afflicted, would be sullen or despondent. Hopes and
fears, joy and sorrow, are, therefore, so blended in his life, as
both to give room  for worldly pursuits, and to recall, from
time to time, the admonitions of conscience.
SECTION IV.
TIm   once pastnever returns: the moment which is lost.
is lost forever.
There is nothing on earth so stable, as to assure us of un,
disturbed rest; nor so powerful, as to afford us constant protection.
The house of feasting too often becomes an avenue to the
house of mourning. Short, to the licentious, is the interval
between them.
it is of great importance to us, to form a proper estimate
of human life; without either loading it with imaginary evils,
or expecting from it greater advantages than it is able to
yield.
Among all our corrupt passions, there is a strong and intimate connexion. When any'one of them is adopted into our
family, it seldom quits until it has fathered upon us all its
kindred,
Charity$ like the sun, brightens every object on whic.hit
shines; a censorious disposition casts every character into the
darkest shade it will bear.
Many men mistake the love, for the practice of virtue; irnd
are not so much good men, as the friends of goodness.LECT T flS,

Genuine virtue has a language that speaks to every heart
throulhout the world.  It is a language which is understood
by all. In every region, every climate, the homage paid to
it is the same.  In no one sentiment were ever mankind
more generally agreed.
The appearances of our security are frequently deceitful.
When our sky seems most settled and serene, in some unobserved quarter gathers the little black cloud in which the
tempest ferments, and prepares to discharge itself on our
bead.
The man of true fortitude may be compared to the casjle
built on a rock, which defies the attacks of surrounding
waters: the man of a feeble and timorous spirit, to a hut
placed on the shore, which every wind shakes, and every wave
overflows.
Nothing is so inconsistent:with- self-posession as violent
anger.  It overpowers reason; confounds our ideas; distorts

When we reflect on the many distresses which abound
in  human  life; on the scanty proportion  of happiness

have been a prevalent passion among men, much more that
it should have prevailed among Christians. Where so mucli
is suffeied in common, little room is left for envy. There is
more occasion for pity and sympathy, and inclination to assist
each other.

WHENCE arises the misery of this present world? It is
not owing to our cloudy atmosphere, our changing seasons, and inclement skies.  It is not owing to the debility
of our bodies, or to the unequal distribution of-the goods
of fortulne.  Amidst all disadvantages of this kind, a pure,
a steadfast and enlightened mind, possessed of stronA virtue, could enjoy itself in peace, and smile at the impotent
assaults of fortune and the elements.  It is within ours,lves
that misery has fixed its seat.  Our disordered hearts, our
guilty passions, our violent prejudices, and misplaced desires,
are the instruments of the trouble which we endure.  Those
sharpen the darts which adversity would otherwise point ilr,
vain against us.
While the vain  and  the licentious are revelling in the
midst of extravagance and riot, how little do they think of
those scenes of sore distress which  are passing at that nmoment throughout the world; multitudes struggling  for a
poor subsistence, to sulpport the wife and children whonl
they love, and who look up to them  w;th eager eyes for
tbat bread  which  they  can  hardly  procure; multitudes  
groaning under sickness in desolate cottages, untended  and
unmourned; many, apparently in a better situation of life,
pining away in secret with concealed griefs; families weeping
over the beloved friends whom  th:ey have lost, or in all the
bitterness of anguish, bidding those who are just expiring tle

Never adventure  oll too near an  approach to what is

In seasons of distress or difficulty, to abandon ourselves
to dejection, carries no mark of a great or a worthy mind.
Instead of sinking under trouble, and declaring " that his

in the evil day, with firmness to maintain his post; to bear
up against the storm; to have recourse to those advantages
which, in the worst of times, are always left to integrity and
virtue; and never to give up the hope that better days may

How many young persons have at first set out in th.e wopild

corrupting pleasures: and those very persons, who promisei

No rank or possessions can mske the guilty mind happy.
DioNYsIus, the tyrant of Sicily, was far from being happy, though he possessed great riches, and all the pleasures
which wealth and power could procure.  Damocles, one of'his flatterers, deceived by those speciouslappearances of happiness, took occasion to compliment hiln on the extent of his
power, his treasures and royal magnificence: and declared
that no monarch had ever been greater or, happier than Dionysius.  "'Hast thou a mind, Damocles," says the king, "to
taste this hMppiness; and to know, by experience,, what the
enjoyments are, of whichi thou hast so high an idea?" Damocles, with joy, accepted the offer.  The kil)g ordered that a
royal banquet should be prepared, and a gilded sofa, covered
with rich embroidery, placed for his favourite.  Side boards,
loaded with gold and silver plate of imnmense value, were
arranged in the apartment.  Pages of extraordinary beauty
were ordered to attend his table,, and to obey his commands
with the utmost'readiness, and the most profound submission.
Fr-agrant ointments, chaplets of flowers, and rich perfumes,
were added to the entertainmetnt.   The table was loaded
with the most exqtisite delicacies of every kind.   Damocles, intoxicated with pleasure, -fancied himself amongst
superior beings.  But in the midst of all this happiness, as
he lay indulging himself in state, he sees let down from the
ceilitg, exactly over his head, a vlittering sword hung by
a single hair.  T'he sight of impenrding destruction put a
speedy end to his joy and revelling.  T'he pomp of his attendance, the glitter of'te carved plate, and the delicacy
of tihe viands, cease to afford him any pleasure.  He dreads
to stretch forth his hand to the table.  He throws off the
garland of roses.  He hastens to remove from his dangerous
situation; and earnestly entreats the king to restore him to
his former humble condition, having no desire to enjoy any
longer a happiness so terrible.
By this device, Dionyvsius intimated to Damocles, how
miserable he was in the midst of a ll his treasures; and in possession of all the honours and epjoyments which royalty could
bestow.                                          CICERO.SECTION II.
Change of external condition is often adverse to virtue.,
IN  the days of Joram, king of Israel, flourished the
prophet Elisha.   His Ciharacter was so eminent, and his
imne so widely spread, that Benhadad, the king of Syria,
though an idolater, sent to consult him, concerning  the
issue of a distemper whVich  threatened his life,.  The messenger employed on this occasion was Hazael, who appears
to have been one of the princes, or chief men of the
Syrian court.  Charged with rich gifts from  the king, he
presents himself before the prophet;  and accosts him in
terms of the  highest respect.   During the  conference
which they held toggether, Elisha fixed his eyes stedfastly on
the countenance of dIatzael; and discerning, by a prophetic
spirit, his future tyranny and cruelty, he could not contain himself from  bursting  into a flood of tears.  When
Ilazael, in surprise, inquired into the cause of this sudden
emotion, the prophet-plainly informed him of the crimes and
barbarities, which he foresaw that he would afterwards commit.   The sol1 of Haz;ael abhorred, at this time, tha
thou,hts of cruelty.  Uncorrupted, as yet, by ambi ion or
greatness, his indignation rose at being thought capable of
the savare actions vwhiich the Iropheti.had mentioned-; and,
with much   riwamth he replies; " But what? is thy- servant a
dog, that he should do t}'is great thing?" Elisha makes no return, but to point out a remarkable change, which was to
take place in his condition; " The Lord lath shown me,that
thou shalt be king over Syria."  In course of time, all that
hiad been predicted came to pass.  Hazael ascended the
throne, and afmbition took possesion of his heart.   " He
smote the children of Israel in all their coasts.  He oppressed them during  all the da-ys of king Jehoahaz:" and, fromn
whlat is left on record of his actions, he plainly appears to
have proved,, what the prophet foresaw him to be, a man of
violence, cruelty, and blood.
In this passage of history, an object is presented, which
deserves our serious attefntion.  We behold a man who, in
one state of life, could not look upon certain crimes without surprise and horror; who knew so little of himself, as

HEaman; or, the misery of pride.
AHASUERUS, who is supposed to be the prince known
among the Greek historians by the  name of Artaxerxes,
had advanced to the chief dignity in his kingdom, Haman,
an Amalekite, who inherited--all the ancient enmity of his
race, to the Jewish nation. Lie appears, from what is re,
corded of him, to have been  a very wicked  minister.
Raised to greatness without nmerit, he employed' his power
solely for the gratification of hi-s passions. As the honours
which he possessed were next to royal, his pride was every
day fed with that servile homage, which is peculiar'to
Asiatic courts; and all the servants of the king prostrated
themselves before him.  In the midst of this general adulation, one -person only stooped not to Haman.  This was
Mordecai the Jew; who, knowing this Amalekite to. be
an enemy to the people of God, and, with virtuous indignation, despising that insolence of prosperity with which he

On tihis appearance of disrespect from Mlordecai, Haman
"was full of wrath: but he thought scorn to lay hands
on Mordecai alone,"  Personal revenge was not sufficient
to satisfy him. So violent and black were his passions, that
he resolved  to  extelrminate the whole nation to which
Mordecai belonged. Abusing, for his cruel purpose, the
favour of his credulous sovereignu, he obtained a decree to
be sent forth, that, against a certain day, all the Jews
throughout the Persian dominions should, be put to the
sword.  Meanwhile, confident of-success, and blind to ap.

It might afford matter for much instraction, by the conspicuous justi:ce of God in his fall and punishment.'But contemplating only the sitgultr situation, in which the expressions just quoted present him,, and the violent agitation of his

creates so much torment'! how unavailing is prosperity, when

THIS excellent personage was descended from  the royal
line of England by both her parents..

throne of England, in opposition to the rights of Mary and
Elizabeth.  At the time of' their marriage, she was only
about eighteen years of age, and het hfisband was also very
young: a season of li0f very unequal to oppose the interested
views of artful and aspiring men; who, instead of exposing s
them to danger, should have been the protectors of their innocence and youth.
This extraordinary young person, besides the solid endowments of piety and virtue, possessed the most engaging disposition, the most accomplished parts; and being of an equal
age with king Edward VI. she had received all her education
with hiin, and seemed even to possess a greniter facility in acquiring every part, of manly and classical literature.  She had
attained a knowledge of the Roman and Greek languages, as
well as of several modern tongues; had passed most of her time
in an application to learning; and expressed a great indifference
for other occupations end amusements usual with her sex and
station.  Roger Ascham, tutor to the lady Elizabeth, having.
at one time paid her a visit, founrd her employed in--eading
Plato, while the rest of the family were engaged in a party
of hunting in the park; and upon his admiring the singularity
of her choice, she told him, that she " received more pleasure
from that author, than others could reap from all their sport
and gaiety." Her heart, replete with this love of literature
and serious studies, and with tenderness towards her husband,
who was deserving of her affection, had never opened itself
to the flattering allurements of ambition; and the information
of her advancement to the throne was by no means agreeable
to her. She even refused to accept the crown; pleaded the
preferable Iight of the two princesses; expressed her dread
of the- c,nsequences attending an enterprise so dangerous,
not to say so criminal; and desired to remain in that private
station in which she was born.  Overcome at last with the
entreaties, rather than reasons, of her father and father-inlaw, and, above all, of her husband, she submitted to their
will, and was prevailed on to relinquish her own judgment.
But her elevation was of very short continuance.'rhe na-a -
tion declared for queen Mary; and the lady Jane, after wearing the vain pageantry of a crown during ten days, returned
to a private life, with much more satisfaction than she felt
then royalty was tendered to her44                  The lE:ngigsh Feader.          Part 1.
Queen M1ary, who appears to have been incapable of
generosity or clemency, determined to remove every person,
from whom the least danger could be apprehended. Warning was, therefore, given to lady Jane to prepare for deatha doom which she had expected, and which the innocence of
her life, as well as the misfortunes to which she had been
exposed, rendered no unwelcQme news to her.  The queen's
bigoted zeal, under colour of tender mercy to the prisoner's
soul, induced her to send priests, who-molested her with
perpetual disputation; and even a reprieve of three days was
granted her, in hopes that she would be persuaded, during
that time,, to pay, by a timely conversion to popery, some
regard to her eternal welfare. Lady Jane had presence of
mind, in those melancholy circumstances, not only to defend
her religion by solid arguments, but also to write a letter to
her sister, in the Greek language; in which, besides sending her a copy of the Scriptures in that tongue, she exhorted
her to maintain, in every fortune, a like steady perseverance.
On the day of her execution, her husband, lord. Guilford,
desired permission to see her; but she refused her consent,
and sent him word, that the tenderness of their parting would
overco,le the fortitude of both; and-would too much unbend
their mlnds from  that constancy, wlich their approaching
end required of them.  Their separation, she said, would be
only for a moment; and they would soon rejoin each other ia
a scene, where their affections would be forever united; and
where death, disappointment, and misfortune, could no longer
have access to them, or disturb their eternal felicity.
It had been intended to execute the lady Jane and lord
Guilford together on the same scaffold, at Tower hill;
but the council, dreading the compassion of the people for
their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble birth, changed
their orders, and gave directions that she should be beheaded within the verge of the Tower.  She saw her husband)
led to execution; and having given him from the window
some token of her remembrance, she waited with tranquillity till her own appointed hour should bring lier to a
like fate. She even saw his headless body carried back in
a cart; and found herself more confirmed by the reports,
which she heard of the constancy of his end, than shaken
by so tender and melancholy a spectacle.  Sir John Gage,
constable of the Tower, when he led her to execution, desired hereto'bestow on him some small present, which heiap. 2.           J'a rratlz,ve Pieces.               45
might keep as a perpetual mernmorial of her.  She gave
him her table-book, in which she had just ivritten three
sentences, on seeing  her husband's dead body; one in
Greek, -another in Latin, a third in English.  The purport
of them was, "that hurman justice was against his body, but
the Divine Mercy would be favourable to his soul; and that
-if her fault deserved ptrnislhment, her youth, at least, and
her imprudence, were worthy of exculse; and that God and
posterity, she trusted, would show  her favour."   On the
scaffold, she made a speech to the bv-standers, in which the
mildness of her disposition led her to take the blame entirely
on herself, without uttering one complaint against the severity with which she had been treated.  She said, that her offence was, not that.she had laid her, hand upon the crown,
but that she had not rejected it with sufficient constancy; that
she had less erred through arlbitioni than through reverence
to her parents, whom  she had been taught to respect and
obey: that she willingly received death, as the only satisfaction whlich she could now  make to the injured state; ard
though her infringement of the laws had been constrained,
she would show, by-her voluntary submission to their sentence, that she was desirous to atone forthat disobedience,
into which too much fliial piety had'betrayed her: that she
had justly deserved this punislihment for being made the instrument, though the unwillin, instrument, of the anmbitio~
of others: and that the story of her life, she hoped,     J
at least be useful, by proing that innocence ex;cuses'not
great misdeeds, if they tend any way to the destruction of
the cornmonwealithi. -After utteriag these words, she caulsedt herself to be disrobed by her women, and with a steady,

Ortogrul; or, the vanity of riches.
As Ortogrul of Basra was one day wandering along the
streets of Bagdat, musing on the varieties of merchandise
which the shops opened to his view; and observin'g the different occupations whict busied the, mltitude Qn every sidet
he was awakened from  the tranquillity of meditation, by a
crowd that obstructed his passage. -He raised his eyes, and
saw the chief vizier, who, having returned from the divan,
wa. entering his palace.46                The EDglish Reader               Part 1.
Ortogrul mingled with the attendants; and being supposed
to have somwt petition for the vizier, was permitted to enter.
He surveyed the spaciousness of the apartments, admired the
walls hung with golden tapestry, and the floors covered with
silken carpets; and despised the simple neatness of his own
little habitation.
"Surely," said he to himself, "this palace is the seat of
happiness; where pleasure succeeds to pleasure, and discontent and sorrow can have nio admission.  Whatever nature
has provided for the delight of sense, is here spread forth to
be enjoy,'.  What can mortals hope or imagile, which the
bimaster of this palace has not obtained?  The dishes of luxtlry cover his table! the voice of harmony lulls him  in his
bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java,
and sleeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges.  He
speakls, and hismanr4ate is obey,ed; he wishes, and his wiish
ms gratified; all, whom he sees, obey him, and all, whonm he
hears, flatter him.  How different, Oh Ortogrul, is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torments of unsatisfied desire; and who hast no amusement in thy power, that
tan withhold thee from thy own reflections!.They tell thee
that thou art wise; but what does wisdom avail With poverty?
None will flatter the poor; and the wise have ve:y little power of flattering themselves. l That man is surely the most
Wretched of the sons of wretchedness, who lives with his
own faults. and follies always before him; and who has none
to reconcile him to himself by praise and veneration. I have
long sought content, and have not found it; I ill from this
Fioment endeavour to be rich."
Full of his new  resolution, he shut himself in.his chatnher for six months, to: deliberate how he - should grow, rich.
IHe somitmes purposed to offer himself as a counsellor to
one of the kings in India; and sometimes resolved to dig
for diamonds in the mines of Golconda.  One day, after
some hours passed in violent fluctuation of opinion, sleep
insensibly sgized him  in his chair.  He dreamed that he
was -ranging, a desert eountry, in search of some one that
might tekh hhim to grow  rich; and as'he stood on the
top of a hil1, shaded wit-h cypress, in doubt- whither to
61irect his steps, his father appeared on a sudden standing
before him.  "'Ortogrul,"  said  the  old  man, -'know

tumbling down the roclks, roaring with the noise of thunder, and scattering its foam  on the  impending woods.
"Now," said his fat`er, "behold the valley that lies between the hills."  Ortogrul looked, and espied a little well,
out of which issued a small rivulet.  "Tell me now," said
his father, " dost thou wish for sudden affluence, that may
pour upon thee like the mountain torrent; or for a slow
and gradual increase, resembling the rill gliding from the
well?"  "Let me be quickly rich,"  said Ortogrul; "let
the golden stream  be quick and violent."  "Look round
thee," said his father,' once again."  Ortogrul looked, and
perceived the channel of-the torrent dry and dusty; but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake,
which the supply, slow and constant, kept (always full.  He 6
awoke, and determined to grow rich by silent profit, and
persevering industry..
Having sold his patrimony, he engaged in merchandise;
and in twenty years purchased lands, on which he raised
a house, equal/ in sumptuousness to that of.the vizier, to
which he invited all the mirnstersl of pleasure, expecting to
enjoy all the -felicity which he had imagined riches able to
afford.  Leisure soon made him weary of himself, and he
longed to be persuaded that he was great and  happy.
He was courteous and liberal: he gave all that approached'
him hopes of pleasing him, and all who should please him,
hopes of being rewarded.  Every art of praise was tried,
and every source of adulatory fiction was exhausted.  Ortogrul' heard'his flatterers without delight, because he found
himself unable to believe them.  His own heart told him its
frailties; his.own understanding reproached him  with his
faults.  "How long," sai(d he, with a deep sigh, " have I,been labouring in vain to amass wealth, which at last is useless'! Let no man hereafter wish to be rich, who is alread.

to weariness; and I sat down on the fragment of a rock
overgrown with moss; where the rustling of the falling
leaves, the dashing of waters, and the hum of the distant
city, soothed my mind into a most perfect tranquillity;
and sleep insensibly stole upon me, as I was indulging the
agreeable reveries, which the objects around me naturally
inspired.
I immediately found myself in a vast extended plain, in
the middle of' which arose a mountain higher than I had before any coDception of.  It was covered with a multitude of
people, chiefly yo0uth; many of whom pressed forward with
the liveliest expression  of ardour in their countenance,
though the way was in many places steep and difficult.
I observed, that those,- who had but just begun to climb
the hill, thought themselves  not far from the top; but as
they proceeded, new hiills were continul-ly rising to their
view; and the summit of the highest they could before
discern seemed but the foot of another, till the motuntain
at length appeared to lose itself in the clouds; As I was
gazing on these things with astonishment, a friendly instructer suddenly appeared: "the mountain before thee," said
be, "is the Iiillof Science. On the top is the temple of
Truth, whose head is above the clouds, and a veil of pure
light covers her' face. Observe the progress of her votaries  
be silent and attentive."
After I had noticed a variety of objects, I turned my
eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the steep ascent; and observed amongst them  a youth of a lively
look, a piercing eye, and something fiery and irregular in
all his motions.  His name was Genius.  He darted like
an eagle up the mountain; and left his companions gazing
after him with envy and admiration: but his progress was
iniiequal, and interrupted by a thousand caprices.  When
Pleasure warbled in the valley, he mingled in her train.'
When Pride beckoned'towards the precipice, he ventured
to the totteringedge.  He delighted in devious and un-,tried paths; and made so mawy excursions firom  the road,A
that his feebler companions often outstripped him.  I observed- thatf the Muses beheld him  with pat'tiality; but
Tr ruth often frowned and turned aside her face.  While
Genius was thus wasting his strenoth in eccentric flights, 1

removing every stone that obstructed his way, till he saw
most of those below  him, who had at first derided his
slow  and  toilsome  progress.  Indeed, there  were few
who ascended the hill with eqqal, and uninterrupted steadiness; for, besides the difficulties of the way, they were
continually solicited to turn aside, by a numerous crowd
of Appetites,: Passions, and Pleasures, whose importunity,
when once Complied with, they became less and less able
to resist: and though they often returned to the path, the
asperities of the road were more severely felt; the hill appeared more steep and rugged; the fruits, which were
wholesome and refreshing, seemed harsh and ill tasted;
their sight grew dim; and their feet tript at every little
obstruction.
I saw, with some surprise, that the Muses, whose business was to cheer and encourage those who were toiling up
the ascent, would often sing- in the bowers of Pleasure,
and accompany those who were enticed away at the call of
the Passions.  They accompanied them, however, but a
little way rand always forsook them  when they lost sight
of the hill.  The tyrants- then doubled their chains upon
the unhappy captives; and led them  away, without resistance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the mansions of Misery.  Amongst the innumerable seducers, who - were endeavouring to draw  away the votaries of Truth from!the
path of science, there was one, so little formidable in her
appearaice, and so gentle and languid in her attempts,
that I should scarcely have taken. notice of her, but for
the numbers she had imperceptibly loaded with her chains.
Indolence, (for so she was called,) far from proceeding to
open hostiIities,--did not attempt to turn their feet out of
the- path, -but contented herself with retarding their progress; and the purpose she could not force them to abandon, she persuaded them  to delay.  Her touch had a
power like that of the torpedo, which withered the strength
6f those who came within its influence.  HTer unhappy
cdptives still turned their faces towards the temple," and
always hoped to arrive there; but the' ground seemed to
slide from beneath their feet, and they fou-nd themselves at.
the bottom, before they suspected, they had changed their
place.  The placid serenity, which at first appeared in
their countenance, changed by degrees into a melancholy
languor, which'vas tinged iith deeper and deeper gloo!m,

and sluggish water, which is curled by no breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead sea, where
startled passengers are awakened by the shock, and the next
moment buried in the gulf of Oblivion.
Of all the unhappy deserters from the paths of Science, none
seemed less able to return than the followers of' Indolence.
The captives of Appetite and Passion would often seize the
moment when their tyrants were languid or asleep, to escape
from their enchantment; but the dominion of Indolence was
constant and unremitted; and seldom resisted, till resistance
was in vain.
After contemplating these things, I turned my eyes towards
the top of the mountain, where the air was always pure and
exhilarating, the path shaded with laurels and evergreens,
and the effuigence which beamed from the face of Science
seemed to shed a glory round her votaries. Happy, said I,
are they who are permitted to ascend the mountain! Buit
while I was pronouncing this exclamation, with uncommon
ardour, I saw, standing beside me, a form of diviner features,
and a more benign radiance.' Happier," said she, " are
they whom Virtue conducts to the Mansions of Content!"
"What," said I, "does Virtue then reside in the vale?" "I
am found," said she, "in the vale, and I illuminate the
mouintain. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and inspire the
sage at his meditation. I mingle in the crowd of cities,- -and
bless the hermit in his cell. I-have a temple in every heart
that owns my influence; and to him that wishes for me, I am
already present.  Science may raise thee to eminence; but I
alone can guide thee to felicity.!"  While Virtue was thus
speaking, I stretched out my arms towards her, with a
vehemence which broke my slumber.  The chill dews Were
falling around me, and the shades of evening stretched over
the landscape. I hastened homeward; and'resigned the
n igt to silence and meditation.:                  AIKEN.
SECTION VII.,  The journey of a day; ap cture of human lffe.
OBIDAn, the son of Abensina, left the caravansera early
iz the morning, and pursued  his- journey throulgh the
plains of Indostan. He was fresh and vigorous with rest;

gradually rising before him.  As he passed along, his ears
were delighited with the morning song:of the bird of paradise; he was fanned by the last flutters of the sinking
breeze, and sprinkled with dew-by groves of spices.  He
sometimes contemplated the towering height of the oak,
monarch of the hills; and sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose, eldest daughter of the spring: all
his senses were gratified, and all care was banished from his
heart.
Thus he went on, till the sun- approached his meridian,
and the increased heat preyed upon"his strehgth;  he then
looked round about hili6 for some more commodious path.
He saw, on his right hand, a grove that seemed to wave its
shodes as a sigh of invitation; he  entered it, and found the
coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant.  He did not, however, forget whither he was travelling; but found a narrow
way bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the
same direction witf the main road; and was pleased, that,
by this happy experiment,:he had found means to unite
pleasure with business, and to gain the rewards of diligence
vithoult suffering its fatigues.  He, therefore, still continued
to walk for a time, without the least remission of his ardour,
except that he was sometimes tempted to stop by the musit
of the birds, wbich the heat had assembled in the shade;
and sometimes amused himself with plucking the flowers tha
covered the banks on either side, or the fruits that hung
upon the branches.  At last, the green path began to decline
from its first tentlency, and to wind among hills and thickets,
cooled with fountains, and murmuring with waterfalls. Here
Obidah paused for a time, and began to consider whether it'
were longer safe to forsake,the known and common track;
but remembering that tL-e heat was now in its- greatest vio
lence, and that the plain was dustv and uneven, he resol:ved
to pursue the new path, which he supposed only to male: a -.
few meanders, in compliance with the varieties of the ground,
and to end at last in the common road.
Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pace,
though h.e suspected that he was:-not gaining ground.  This

course of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and
watered a large region with innumerable circumvolutions.
In these amusements, the hours passed away unaccounted;
his deviations had perplexed his memory, and he knew not
towards what point to travel. He stood pensive and confused, afraid to go forward lest he should go wrong, yet conscious that the time of loitering was, now past.  While he
was thus tortured with uncertainty, the sky was overspread
with clouds; the day vanished from before him; and a suddlen tempest gathered round-his head. He was now roused
by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he- now saw how happiness is lost when ease is consulted; he lamented the unmanly ilmpatience that prompted him
to seek shelter in the g-rove; and despised the petty- curiositv that led him on from trifle to trifle.  While he was thus
reflecting, the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke
his meditation.
H1e now revolved to do what yet remained in his power,
to tread back the ground which he had passed, and try to
find some issue where the wood might open into the plain.
He prostrated himself on the ground, and recommended his
life to the Lord of Nature.  lie rose with confidence and
tranquillity, and pressed on with resolution. The beasts of
the desert were in motion, and on every hand were heard
the mingled howls of rage and fear, and ravage and expiration., --All the horrors of darkness and solitude surrounded
him' the winds roared in the woods.; and the torrents tumbled from the hills.
Thus forlorn and distressed, he wandered through the.
wild, without knowing whither be was going, or whether
he was -every moment drawig nearer to safety, or to destruction. At length, not fear-, but labour, began to'overcome hiin; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled;
and he was on the point of lying down in, resignation to- his
fate, wherr he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of
a taper. He advanced towards the light; and finding that it
proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at
the door, and obtained admission. The old man set before
him such provit4ns as he had -collected for himself, on which
Obidah fe          erwith eagerness and gratitude.
When the repast was over, " Tell me," said the hermit,
"by what chance thou hast been brought hither? I have
been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wvilderness, inChiap. 2.' ~01arrative Pieces.               53
which I never sTaw aman before."  Obidah then related theoccurrences of his journeyr, without any conccalaient or palliation.
"Son," sai-d the hermit, " let the errors and follies, the
dangers and escape of this day, sink deep into thy heart.
Remember, my son, that- huian life is the journey of a
day.  WV  rise in the morning of youth, full of vigour,
and full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and hope,
with gaietyand with diligence, and travel on a while in the direct road of piety towards the tansions of rest.  In a short
time, we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find some mitigation of our duty, and some more easy means of obtaining
the same end.  We then relax our vigour, and resolve no
longer to be terrified with crimes at a distance; but rely
upon our own constancy, and venture to approach what we.resolve never to touch.  We thus enter the bowers of ease,
and repose in the shades of security.  Here the heart softens, and vigilance subsides;\ we are then willing to inquire
whether another advance cannot be miade, and whether we
may not, at least, turn our eyes upon the gardens of plea.,
sure.: We approach them with scruple and hesitation: we
enter them, but enter timorous and trembirig; trnd alivays
hope to pass through t-hem without losing the road of virtue,
which, for a while, we keep in our sight, and to which wt
purpose to return.  But temptation succeeds temptation, ai
one compliance prepares us for another; we in time lose txhe
happiness of innocence, and solace our disquiet withv selt
sual gratificaftims.  By degrees, we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate
object of rational desire.  We entangle ourselves in business,
mamerge ourselves in Iuxury, and rove through the labyrinths
of inconstancy; till the) darkness of old age begins to invadlus, and disease and anxiety  obstruct our way.  We thet| tool
back*apon our lives with horror, Witil sorrow,  tiih repentance; and wish, but too often vainly wih,  that we bhad not

DIDACTIC PIECES
SECTION I.
The importance of a good Edulcation
I CONSIDER a human soul, without education, like marble in the quarry: which shows none of its inherent beauties, until the skill of the polisher-- fetches dut the colours,
makes the surface shine, and discovers every ornamental cloud, spot, and vein, that runs through the body of it.
Educatlon, after the same manner, when it works upon a
noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which, withojut such helps, are never able to make their
appearance..,  
If my reader will give me leave to change the' allusion so
Soon upon him, I shall make use of? the same instance to illustrate the force of education, which Aristotle has brought
to explain his doctrine of substantial forms, when he tells us
that a statue lies hid in a block of marble; and that the art
of the statuary only clears away the superfluous matter, and
removes the rubbigh.  The figure is in the stone, and the
sculptor only finds it. What sculpture is to a block of tarble, education is to a'human soul. The philosopher, the
saint, or the hero, the wise, the good, or the great man,
very often lies hid and conce,iled in a plebeian, which a proper  ic.ation might have disinterred, and have brought to
light.  I a-herefore much deliglhted with reading tie accounts of savag4ions; and with contemplating -those virtues -hich are wilda   uncultivated: to see courage exerting itself in fierceness, resolution in obstinacy, wisdom in
cunning, patience in sullenness and despair.
Mel'ss passions operate variously, and appear in different kinds of actions, according as they are more or less
rectfied aid swayed by reason.  When one hears of negroes, who, upon the death of their masters, or upon
changing their service, hang themselves upon the next tree,
as it'ometimes blppens in our American plantations, whoCMkap. 3.             Didactic Pieces.         -        55
ean forbear admiring their fidelity, though it expresses itself in so dreadful a manner? What might not that savage
greatness of soul, which appears in these poor wretches on
many occasions, be raised to, were it righily cultivated?
And what colour of excuse can there be, for the contempt
with which we treat this part of our species:; that we should
not put them upon the common foot of humanity; that we,
should only set an insignificant fine upon the man who murders them; nay, that we should, as much as in us lies, cut
them off from the prospects of happiness in another world, as
well as in this; and deny them that which we look upon as the
proper means for attaining it?
It is therefore an unspeakable blessing, to be bporn in those
parts of the world where wisdom and knowledge flourish;
though, it must be confessed, there are, even in these parts,
several poor uninstructed persons, who are but little above
the inhabitants of those nations of which I have been here
speaking; as those who have had the ad4antages of a more
liberal education, rise above one another by several different
degrees of perfection. For, to return to our statue in tho
block of marble, we see it sometimes only begun to be chipped, sometimes rough hewn,, and but just sketched into a human figure; sometimes, we see the man appearing distinctly
in all his limbs and features; sometimes, we find the figure
wrought up to great elegancy; but seldom meet with any to
which the hand of a Phidias or a Praxiteles could n.ot give
several nice touches and finishings.         ADIDISoN.
SECTION II.
On Gratitude.
THERx is not a more pleasing exercise of the mind, than
gratitude.  It is accompanied with so great inward satisfaction, that the duty is sufficiently rewarded by the performance.  It is not, like the practice of many other virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with so much pleasure, that
were there no positive command which enjoined it, nor any
recompense laid up for it hereafter, a generous mind would
indulge in it, for the natural gratification which it affords.
If gratitude is due from man to main, how much more
from  man to his Maker: The Supreme Being does not
only confer upon us those bounties which proceed more immediately from his hand, but even those benefits which areM66         -       JThe English Reader.           Part 1
conveyed to-us by others.  Every. blessing we enjoy, by
what means soever it may be derived upon us, is the gift of
Him who is the great Author of good, and the Father of
mercies.
If gratitude, when exerted towards one another, naturally
produces a very pleasing sensation in the mind of a grateful
man, it exalts the soul into rapture, when it is employed on
this great object of gratitude; on this beneficent Being, who
has given us every thing we already possess1 and from whom
we expect every thing we yet hope for.            ADDISON.
SECTION III.
On Forgiveness.
TiE most plain and natural sentiments of equity concur
with divine authority, to enforce the duty of forgiveness.
Let him who has never in his life done wrong, be allowed
the privilege of remaining inexorable.  But let such as are
conscious of frailties and crinmes, consider forgiveness as a
debt which.they owe to others.  Common failings are the
strongest lesson of mutual forbearance.  Were this virtue
unknown- among men, order and comfort, peace and repose,
would be strangers to human life. Injuries retaliated accordIng to the exorbitant measure which  passion prescribes,
would excite resentment in return.  The injured person
iwould become the injurer;  and thus wrongs, retaliations, and
fresh injuries, would circulate in endless succession, till the
world was rendered a field of blood. Of all the, passions
which invade the human breast, revenge is the most direful.
When allowed to reign with full dominion, it is more than
sufficient to poison the few pleasures which remain to man
in his prsent state. How much soever a person may suffer
fm.injustice, bhe is always in hazard of suffering more from
the prosecution of revenge.  The violence of an enemy can.not inflict what is equal to the torment he creates to himself,
by means of the fierce and desperate passions which he allows
to rage in his soul.
Tbhose -evil spiris who -inhabit the regions of misery are
represented as delighting in revenge and cruelty.  But all
that is great and good in the iuniverse, is on the side of
clemency and mercy-  The almighty Ruler of the world,
though for ages ofl'ended by the. unrighteousness, and:in
sulted- by the impiety of men, is "long suffering and sow
to-anget."  His Son, wheia be appeared in our nature, etChcil. 3.             Didactic Pieces.                      
hibited, both in hlis life and his death, the most illulstrious example of forgiveness which the world ever beheld.  If we
look into the history of mankind, we shall find that, in every
age, they who ha;ve been respected as worthy, or admired as
great, have been distinguished for this virtue. Revenge dwells
in little minds. A noble and magnanimous spirit is alwrays
superior to it.  It suffers not from the injuries of men those
severe shocks which others feel.  Collected withinritself, it
stands unmoved by their impotenlt assaults; and with generous pity, rather than with anger, looks down on their unworthy conduct.  It has been truly said, that the greatest man
on earth can no sooner commit an injury, than a good man
can make himself greater, by forgiving it,            BLAIaR.
SECTION IV,.Motives to the practice of gentleness.
To promote the virtue of gentleness, we ought to view our
character with an impartial eye; and to learn, from our own
failings, to give that indulgence which in our turn vre claim.
It is pride.which fills the world with so much harshness and
severity.  In the fulness of self-estimation, we forget what
we are.  We claim  attentions to which we are not entitled.
We are rigorous to offences, as if we had never offended;
unfeeling to distress, as if we knew not what it was to suffer.
From those airy regions of pride and folly, let us descend to
our pr$per level. Let us survey the natural equality on which
Providence has placed man with man, and reflect on the infirfmities common to all.  If the reflection on natural equality
and mutual offences, be insufficient to prompt humanity, let
us at least remember what we. are in the sight of our Creator.  Have we none of that forbearance to give one another,
which we all so earnestly intreat from heaven? Can we look
for clemency or gentleness from our Judge, when we are so
backward to show it to our own,brethren?
Let us also accustom ourselves, to reflect on the small moment of those things, which are the usual incentives to violence and contention.  In the ruffled and angry hour, we
view  every appearance through a false medium.  The most
inconsiderable point of interest, or honour, swells into a momentous object; and the slightest attack seems to threaten
immediate ruin.  But after passion or pride has subsided, we
look around in vain for the mighty mischiefs we dreaded.
The. fabric, which our disturbed imagination had reared, to-:PREFACE.
That this eollectlon may also'serve the purpose of promoting piety and
virtue, the Compiler has introduced many extracts, which place religion
in the most amiable light, and which recommend a great variety of moral duties, by the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects they
ioduce. These subjects are exhibited in a style and manner which are
cflculated to arrest the attention of youth; and to make strong and dorahle impressions on their minds.*
The Compiler has been careful to avoid every expression and sentiment,
that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, itn the least degree, offend the eye or
ear of innocence This he conceives to be peculiarly incumbent on every
person who writes for the benefit of yonth. It would indeed be a great
and happy improvement in education, if no writings were allowed to come
under their notice, but such as are perfectly innocent; and if, on all prpper occasions, they were'incouraged to peruse those which tend to inspie
adue reverence for virtue, and an abhorrence of vice, as well as to ani3tse them with sentiments of piety and goodness. Such impressions
deeply engraven on their minds, and connected with all their attainments,
could scarcely fail of attending them through life, and of producing a sotidity of principle and character, that would be able to resist the danger
arising from future intercourse with the world.:
The Author has endeavoured to relieve the grave and serious parts of
his collection, by the occasional admission of pieces which amnse as.welt
as instruct. - If, however, any of his readers should think it contains too
great aproportion of the former, it may be- some'apology, to observe that,
the -existing publications designed for the perusal of young persons, the
prponderance is greatly on the side of gay and amusing production..
Too. Auch attention may be paid to this medium of improvement.  Wheo.
the imagination, of youth especially, is smuch entertained, the sober dicr
ta  of the understanding are regarded with indifference; and the. influ.eaobof good affections is either teeble,-or transient. A temperate use of
*uch entertainment seems therefore requisite, to afbord proper   f~o
the operations of the understanding and the heart.
The reander will perceive, tilat the Compiler has been solicitous to re.
commend to young persons, the perusal of tile sacred Scriptures, by inter.
spersing  through  his work some of the most beautiful apd inter.
esting-passages of those invaluable writin.-'To excite an early tadte andi
veneration fo. this great rule of life, is a point of so high importance, aMa t
warrant the attempt to promote it on every proper occasion.
To improce the young mind, and to afford some assistance to tutors, iq
the ardu.os and important *work of education, were the'motives which 1ed
to this production. If the Author shlould be so successful as to accomplish
these ends, even in a siaall degree, lie will think that his time and pasil
have been well employed, and_will deem himself amply rewarded.
* In some of the pieces, the C,ompiler has made a few alterations,chiefly vrbal, to tlapt

tally disappears. But tholugh the cause of: contention has
dwindled away, its consequences remain.  We have alienated
a friend; we have imbittered an enemy; we have sown the
seeds of futuare suspicion, malevolence, or disgust.---Let us
suspend our- violence for a moment, when causes of discord
occur.  Let us anticipate that period of coolness, which, of
Itself, will soon arrive.  Let us reflect how little we have any
prospect,of gaining by fierce contention; but how much of
the true happiness of life we are certain of-throwing away.

- q suspicious temper the source of misry to its possessor.
As a suspicious spirit is the source of many crimes and
calamities in the world, so it is the spring of certain misery
to the person who indtulges it.'His friends will be few; and
small will be his conlfort inl those whom he possesses.  Believing others to be his enemies, he will of course make them
such.  Let his caution bIe ever so great, the asperity of his
thoughts will often break out in his behaviour; and in return
fer suspecting and hating, herwill incur suspicion and hatred
Besides the external evils which he draws upon himself, arising
from alienated friendship, broken confidence, and open enmity,
the suspicious temper itself is one of thte worst evils which any
man can suffer. If " in all fear there is torment," how miserable must be his state who, by living in perpetual jealousy, lives
n -perpetual dread! Looking upon himself to be surrounded
w'ispies, enemies, and designing men, hlie is a stranger to reliance and;trust. He knows not to whom toqopen himself. He
dresses his countenance in forced smiles, while his heart throbs
within- from apprehensions of secret treachery. Hence fretfulness and ill-humour, disgust at-the world, and all the painful
sensations of an irritated and imbittered mind.
So numerous and great are the evils -arising from a suspicious disposition, that, of the two extremes, it is more eligible
to expose ourselves to occasional disadvantage from thinking
too well of others, than to -suffer continual misery by thinkking always ill of them.  It is better to be sometimes imposed  
upon, than never to trust.  Safety is purchased at too dear a
rate, when, in order to secu,re it, we are obliged to -be alwaysClhap. 3.             D)idactic Pieceis7                  59
clad in arm5ur, and to live in perpetal hostility with our fellows. -This is, for the sake of living, to deprive ourselves of
the comfort of life.  The man- of candour enjoys his situation,
whatever it is, with cheerfulness and peace.  Prudence directs his intercourse with the world; but no black suspicions
haunt his hours of rest.   Accustomed to view the cha,
racters of his neighbours in the most favourable light, he is
like one who dwells amidst those beautiful scenes of nature,
on' which the eye rests with pleasure.  Whereas the suspicious man, having his imagination filled with all the shocking
forms of human thlsehood, deceit, and treachery, resembles.
the traveller in the wilderness, who discerns no objects around'
him  but such as are either dreary or terrible, caverns that
open, serpents that hiss, and beasts of prey that howl.
SECTION  VI.
Comforts of Religion.
THERE are many who have'passed the age of youth and
beauty; who have resigned the pleasures of that smiling season; who begin to decline into the vale of years, impaired in
their health, depressed in their fortunes, stript of their friends
their children, and perhaps still more tender connexions,
What resource can this world afford them? It presents a dark
and dreary waste, through which there does not issue a single
ray of comfort.  Every delusive prospect of ambi-tion is now
at an end; long experience of mankind, an e;perience very
different from what the open and generous soul of youth had
fondly dreamt of, has rendered the heart almost inaccessible
to new friendships.  The principal sources of activity are, ta
ken away, when they for whom we labour are cut off from
us; they who animated, and who sweetened all the toils ot.f-  
lifer  Where then can the soul find refuge, but in the bosom
of Religion? There she is admitted to those proopects of Providence&amp;and futurity, which alone~can warm and fiH the heart.
I speak here of such as retai:, the feelings of humanity;
whom misfortunes have softened, and perhaps rendered more
delicately sensible; not of such as possess that stupid insensibility, which some are pleased to dignify wvith the name of
Philosophy..It,might therefore be expected, that those philosophers,
whQ:4--jink they stand in no need themrselves of the assistance
-o        af  n to support their virtue, and who never feel the
wa*:?/it:  consolations, woid yet have the humanity toconsider the very different situation of the rest of mankind;
and not endeavour to deprive them of what habit, at least, if
they will not allow it to be nature, has made necessary to
their morals, and to theiir happiness.  It migh-t be'expected,
that humanity would prevent them from breaking into the last
-retreat of the unfortunate, who can no longer be objects or
their envy or resentment; and tearing from them their only
remaining comfort. The attempt;to ridicule religion may be
agreeable to some, by relieving them from restraint upon
their pleasures; and may render others very miserable, by
making them doubt those truths, in which, they were most
deeply interested; but it can convey real good and happiness
to no one individual.-                            GREGORY.

1Dfidence of our abilities, a mnark of R,isdom
IT is a sure indication of good sense, to be diffident of it.
We then, and not till then, alt growing wise, when we begin
to discern how weak and unwise we are.  An absolute perfection of understanding, is impossible: he makes the nearest
approaches to-it, who has the sense-to discern, and the humility to acknowledge, its ir/perfections.  Modesty always
sits gracefully upon youth; it covers a multitude of faults,
and doubles the lustre of every virtue which it seems to hide:
the perfections of men being like those flowers which appear
more beautiful, when their leaves are a little contracted and
folded up, than when they are fill blown, ahd display themselves, without any reserve, to the view.
We are some of us very fond of knowledge, and apt to vaie ourselve's upon any proficiency in the sciences: one
science, however, there is, worth more than all the rest, and
that is, the science of living well-; which shall remain, when
"tongues shall cease," and " knowledge shall vanish away."
-As to new notions, and new doctrines, of which this age is
very fruitfiul, the tisme will come, when we shall have no
v-pleasure in them: nay, the time shall come, when they -shall
be exploded, and would have been forgotten, if they had not
been preserved in those excellent books, which contain a con--
fultation of them; like insects preserved for ages in amber,
which otkerwise would'soon have returned to the common
mass of things.  But a firm belief of Christianity, and a practice suitable to it, will support andl invigorate the mind to the
last; and most of all, at last,lat that important hour,; WhicL

which, like our Saviour, cometh from above, will, through Ihis
m.erits, bring us thither.  All our other studies and pursuits,

On the importance of order in the distribution of our tpnpe.
TIME we ought to consider as a sacred trust committed to
lus by God; of. which we are now the depositaries, and are
to render an account at the last.  That portion of it which he
has allotted to us, is intended partly fo6rthe concerns of this
world, partly-for those,of the next.,Let each of theb,,s  
upy, in the distribution of our time, that space whigh properly belongs to it.  Let not the hours of hospitality and
pleasure interfere with tle discharge of our necessary affairs;
and let not what we call necessary affairs, encroach upon the
time which is due to devotion.  To every thing there is a
season, and a time for every purpose under the heaven. If
we delay till to-morrow  what ought to he done to--day, we
overcharge the morrow wih a bjurden which belons not to
it.  WVe load the wheels of time, and:prevent them from
carrying us along smoothly.  He who every morning plans
the transactions of the day, and follows out that plan,- carries
on a thread which will guide him through the labyrinth Qf the
most. busy life.  The orderly arraagement of his.timne is like
a ray of light, which darts itself through all his affairs.  Buit.
where no plan is laid, where- the disposal of time is Isurierdered merelylto the chance of inci4ents, all thingsli,o hunddled together in one chaos, whiqh-admits neither of distrib.tion nor review.
The first requisite for introduciig order into the management of time, is to be- impressed with a just sense of its
value.  Let us consider well how much depends upon it, and  -
how fast it flies away.  The bulk of men are in nothing
more capricious and inconsistent, thar in their appreciation of
time.  When they think of it, as the measure, of their continuance on earth, they highly prize it,:and with the greatest
~anxietyseek- to lengthen it o-.t. IBut when they, view it in
separate parcels, they appear to hold it in contempt, and
squander it with inconsiderate profusion.  While they complaia that life is short, they are often Wishing its different

periods at an end.  Covetous of every other possession, of
time only they are prodigal.  They allow every idle man to
be master of this property, and make every frivolous occupation welcome that can -bhelp them  to consume it.  Among
those who are so careless of time, it is not to be expected
that order shonud be observed in its distribution.  But, by this
fhtal neglect, how many materials of severe and lasting regret
are they laying up in More for themselves! The time which
they suffer to pass away in the midst of confusion, bitter repentance seeks afterwards in vain to recall.  What was omitted to be done at its proper robment, arises to be the torment
of some filture season.  Manhood is disgraccA by the consequences of neglected youth.  Old age, oppressed by cares that
helonged to a former period, labours under a burden not its,.~owiO  At the'close of life, the dying man- beholds with anguish
that his days are finishing, when his preparation for eternity
is hardly commenced.  Such are We effects of a disorderly
waste of time, through not attending to its value. Every thing
in the life of such persons is misplaced.  Nothing is performed arigbht, from not being performed in due season.
But he who is orderly in- the distribution of his time, takes
the,proper method of escaping those manifold evils.  Hie is
justly said to redeem the time.  By proper management, he
prolongs it.  He lives much in little space; more in a few
years than others do in many.  He can live to God and his
own soul, and at the same time attend to all the lawful interests of the present world.  He looks back on the past, and
provides for the future.  He catches and arrests the hours as.
they'fly.  They are marked down for useful pu::poses, and
their memory remains.  Whereas those hours fleet by the
man of confusion like a shadow.  His days and years are
either blanks, of which he' has no remembrance, or they are
filled up with so confused and irregular a successiol of un:
finished transactions, that though he remembers he has been
busy, yet he can give no account of the business whish has
employed him.                                      BLAIR.

general, that they, who, in any of the great lines of life, have
distinguished themselves for thinking profoundly, and acting
nobly, have despised popular prejudices; and departed, in several things, from the common ways of the world.  On no occasion is this more requisite for true honour, than where religion and morality are concerned.  In times of prevailing licentiousness, to maintain unblemished virtue, and uncorrupted
integrity; in a public or a private cause, to stand firm by
vwhat is fair and just, amidst discouragements and opposition;
despising groundless censure and reproach; disdaining all
compliance with public manners, when they are vicious and
unlawful; and never ashamed of the punctual discharge of
every dluty towards God and man;-this is what shows true
greatness of spirit, and will force approbation even from the
degenerate multitude themselves.  " This is the man," (their
conscience will oblige thern to acknowledge,) ", whom we are
unable to bend to mean condescensions.  We see it in vain

within, which we cannot shake.  To this man we nray, on any
occasion, safely commit our cause.  He is incapable of betraying his trust, or deserting his friend,, or denying his faitth."
It is, accordingly, this steady inflexible virtue, this regard
to principle, superior to all custom and opinion, which pecu'liarly marked the characters of those in any age, w!o have
shone with distinguished lustre;  and has cosecrated their
mnemory to all posterity.  It was this that obtained to ancient
Enoch the most singular testimony of honour from heaven.

till the good man was called away, by a heavenly messenger,

a preacher of righteoulsness.  He stood alone, and was scoffed by the profane crew.  But they by the delutge were swept

which we behold around us; and when we are in hazard of
being swayed by such, let us fortify our virtue, by thinking
of those who, in former times, shone like stars in the midst
of surrounding darkness, and are now shining in the kingdom
of heaven, as the brightness of the firmament, for ever and
ever.                                               BLAIR.
SECTION  X.
The mortifications of vice greater than those of virtue.
THOUGH no condition of human life is free from uneasiness,
yet it must be allowved, that the uneasiness belonging to a sinful course, is far greater, than what attends a course of welldoing.  If we are weary of the labours of virtue, we may be
assured, that the wcrld,:whenever we try the exchange, will
lay upon us a much heavier load.  It is the outside only, of a
licentious life, which is gay and smiling.  Within, it conceals
toil, and trouble,_ and deadly sorrow.  For vice poisons human- happiness in the spring, by introducing disorder into the
heart.  Those passions which it seems to indulge, it only
feeds with imperfect gratifications; and thereby btrengthens
them for preying, in the end, on their unhappy victims.
It is a great mistake to imagine, that the pain of self-denial
is confined to virtue.: He who follows the world, as much as
lie who follows Christ, must "take up his cross;" and to him
assuredly, it will prove a more oppressive burden.  Vice allows all our passions to range uncontrolled; and where each
claims to be superior, it is impossible to gratify all.  The pre
dominant desire can only be indulged at the expense of its
rival.  No mortifications which virtue exacts, are more severe
than those, which aumbition imposes upon the love of ease,
pride upon interest, and covetousness upon vanity.  Self-deniat, therefore, belongs, in common, to vice and virtue.; but
with this remarkable difference, that the passions which virtue requires us to mortify, it tends to weaken; whereas, those
which vice obliges us to d(leny, it, at the same time, strengthens.
The one diminishes the pain of self-denial, by moderating the
demand of passion; the pther increaises it, by tendering those
demands imperious and violent.  What distresses that occur
in the calm life of virtue, can be compare to   tortures,
"which remorse of conscience inflicts on t    ed; to those(haP. 3.             Did?actic Pieces.                   (5

SECTION XI.
On Contentment.
CONSTENTME.NT produces, in some measure, all those effects
which~he alchymi } usually ascribes to whatre calls the philosophlr's stone;/and if it does not bring riches, it does the
same' thing;by banishing the desire of them.  If it cannot -emove the disquietudes arising from  a man's mind, body, or
fortune, it makes him easy under them. It has indeed a kindly influence on the soul of man, in respect of every being to
whom he stands related.  It extinguishes all murmur, repining, and ingratitude, towards that Being who has allotted him
his part to act in this world.  It destroys all inordinate ambition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard to the
community wherein he is placed. It gives sweetness to his
conversation, and a perpetual serenity to all his thoughts.
Among the many methods which might be made:se of for
acquiring this vjrtue, I shall mention only the two following.
First of ali, a  iay shduld always consider how muc iOh-  as
more tharn   fn ts; and SecondlA how much more unhappy
he might be than he 1ea llIa3.
First, a man should abltays consider how much he has more
than he wants.  I am  wonderfully pleased with the reply
which Aristippus made to one, who condoled with him upon
the loss of a farm: "Why," said he " I have three farms still,
and you have but one; so that I ought rather to be afflicted
for you, than you for me."  On the contrary, foolish men are
more apt to consider what they have lost, than what they possess; -and to fix-their eyes upon those who are richer than
themselves, rather than on those who are under greater difficulties.  All the real pleasure' and conveniences of life lie
rn a narrow compass; but it is the humour of mankind to be
always looking forward; and straining after one who has got
the start of them in wealth and honour.  For this reason, as
none can be properly called rich, who have not more than
F 266                  Th.e English Rleader.           Part i
they want, there are few rich men in any of the politer nations, but among the middle sort of people, who keep theTl
wishes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than the,
know how to enjoy.  Persons of a higher rank live in a kin.,
of splendid poverty; and are perpetually wanting, because
instead of acquiescing in the solid pleasures of life, they er
deavour to outvie one another in shadows and appearances.
Men of sense have at all times beheld, with a great deal c
mirth, this silly game that is playing over their heads; and.
by contracting their desires, they enjoy all that secret satis
faction which others are always in quest of. The truth is,
this ridiculous chase after imaginary pleasures, cannot be sufficiently exposed, as it is the great source of those evils which
generally undo a nation. Let a man's estate be what it mavy
he -s a poor man, if he does not live within it; and naturally
sets himself to sale to any one that can give him his price
When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had lef
him a good estate, was offered a great sum of money by the
king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindness; but told him.
he had already m:ore by half than he knew what to do with,.
In short, content is equivllent to wealth, and luxury to poverty;
or, to give the thought a more agreeable turn, "Content
is natural iwealth," says Socrates'; to which I shall add, luxury
is artificial poverty. I shall therefore recommend to the consideration of those, who are always aiming at superfluous and
imaginary ejoyments, and who will not be at the trouble of
contracting their desires, an excellent saying of Bion the
philosopher, namely, " Thlat no man has so much care, as he
wvho endeavouris after the most happiness."
In the second place, every one oucht to reflect how much
more unhappy he might be, than he really is.-The former
consideration took in all those, who are sufficiently provided
with the mecans to make themselves easy; this regards sucl
as actually lie under some pressure or misfortune.  These
may reccive great alleviation, from such a comparison as the
unhappy person may Pmake between himself and others; or
between the misfortune which he suffers, and greater misfortunes which might have befailen him.
I like the story of the honc,t Dutchman; who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-mast, told the standers by,
at w;as a great mercy tlhat it was not his neck.  To whicih,
since I amn got in quotations, give mne leave to add the sayi'g of'-an old philosopheil, w*,, after having invited some of;is friends to dine wit)h hi.m'aus rufIed by a person that(?1 pa. 3             Didactic Pieces.'7
-came into the rootn in a passion, and threw down the table
that stood before them: " Every 6hne," says he, ";has his calamity; and he is a happy mnian that has no greater that this."
We find an instance to the same purpose, in the life of iuctor
Hammond, written by bishop Fell. As this good man was
troubled with a complication of distempers, when he hbid the
gout upon him, he used to thank God that it was not the
stone; and when he had the stone, that he had not both
these distempers on him at the same time.
$  I cannot conclude this essay without observing, that there
never was any system. besides that of Christianity, which
could effectually produce in the mind of man the virtue I
have been hitherto speaking of. In order to make us contented with our condition, many of the present philosophers tell
us, that our discontent only hurts ourselves, without being
able to make any alteration in our cir-cumstances; others,.
that whatever evil befalls us is derived to us by a fatal necessity, to which superior beings themselves are subject; while
others, very gravelyv, tell the man who is miserable, that it is
necessary he shouli be so, to keep up the harmony of the universe; and that the scheme of Providence would be troubled
and perverted, were he otherwise. These, and the like
considerations, rather silence than satisfy a man.  They may
show hinm that his discontent is unreasonable, but they are by
no means sufficient to relieve it.  They rather give despair
than consolation.  In a word, a man might reply to one of
these comforters, as Augulstus did to his friend, who advised
himi not to grieve for the death of a person whom'he loved,
because his grief could not fetch him again: " It is for that
very reason," said the emperor " that I grieve."
On the contrary, religion bears a more tender regard to human nature.  It prescribes to every miserable man the means
of bettering his conditi%l nay, it shows him, that bearing
his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them.  It makes him easy here, because it can make
him happy hereafter.                               ADDISON.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD
READING.
TO read with propriety is a pleasing and important attainment; pro-.
ducti.ve of improvement both to the understandiug and the heart. It is essential to a coimplete reader, that he minutely perceive the ideas, and enter
into the feelings of the author, whose sentiments he professes to repeat, for
how is it possible to represent clearly to otlhers, what we have but faint or
inaccurat, conceptions of ourselves? If there were no other benefits resultinig from the aft of reading well, than the necessity it lays ius under, of precisely ascertaining the meaning of what we read; and the habit thence acquired, of doing tllis with facility, both when reading silently and aloud,
they would constitute a sufficient compensation for all thie labour we can
bestow upon the subject. But the pleasure derived to lurselves and olers,
from a clear ecommunication of ideas and feelings; andt th e strong and durable impressions made thereby on the minds of the reader and the audience, are considerations, which give additional importahce to the study
of this necessary and. useful art. The perfect attainnsent of it doubtless requires great attention and practice, joined to extraordinary natural powers%:
but as there are many degrees of excellence in the art, the student whose
ains fall short of perfection will find himself amply rewarded for every exertion he mav think proper to make.  
To give rules for the management of the voice in reading, by which the
necessary pauses, emphasis, and tones, may be discovered and put in practice, is not possibie. After all the directions thqloan be offered on these
points, much will remain to be taught by the liv tio instructer: much willbe attainable by no other means, than the force of example influencing the
imitative powers of the learner.  Some'rules and ptincilples on these heads
will, however, be found useful, to prevent erroneous and vicious Imodes of'
utterance; to gi've the young reader some taste of tte subhject; and to assist him in acquiiing a just and accurate mode of delivery.  The obser-.
vations which we have to make, for these purposes, may be comprised under the following lieads: PROPER.OUDNESS OF VOICE; D!LSTIsNTNEr S;'

which persons of inferior station scrutinise those who are
above them in rank; and if they approach to that rank, their
envy is generally strongest against such as are just one step
higher than themselves.-Alas! my friernds, all this envious
disquietude, which agitates the world, arises from a deceitful
figure which imposes on the public view. False colours are
hung but: the real state of men is not what it seems to be.
The order of society requires a distinction of ranks to take
place: bit in point of happiness, all men come much nearer
to equality than is commonly imagined; and the circumstances, which form any material difference of happiness among
them, are not of that nature which renders them grounds of
envy. The poor man possesses not, it is true, some of the
conveniences and pleasures of the rich; but, in return, he is
free from many embarrassments to which they are subject.
By the simplicity and uniformity of his life, he is delivered
from that variety of cares, which perplex those who have
great affairs to manage, intricate plans to pursue, many enemies, perhaps, to encounter in the pursuit.  In the tranquillity of his small habitation, and private family, he enjoys a
peace which is often unknown at courts.  The gratifications
of nature, which are always the most satisfactory, are possessed by him to their full extent; and if he be a stranger to th
refined pleasures of the wealthy, he is unacquainteil also with
the desire of them, and by consequence, feels no wansit.  His
plain meal satisfies his appetite, with a relish p'robahly higlher
than that of the rich man, who sits down to his lu.xurious banquet.  His sleep is more sound; his health more firm. he
knows not what spleen, languor, and listlessness are. His accustomed employments or labours are not more opptresive to
himn, than the labour of attendance on courts and the gre,lt,
the labours of dress, the fatigue of amusements, thec very
weight of idleness, frequently are t  the rich.  In the mean
time, all the beauty of the face of Rure, all the enjoyments
of donestic society, all the gaiety and cheerfulness of an easy
min.d, are as open to him as to those of Oie highest rank. The
splendour of retinue, the sound of titles, the appearances of
high respect, are indeed soothing, for a short time, to the great.
But, become familiar, they are soon forgotten.  Custom effaces their impression.  They sink into the rank of those ordinary things, which daily recur, without raising any sensation
of joy.-Let us cease, therefore, from  looking up with discontent and envy to those, whom birth or fortune has placed
above us. Let us adjust the balance of happiness fairly. WhenC&amp;hap. 3             Didacttc Pleces.                     69

SECTION XIII.
Patience under provocsatozos our i. terest as well as duty.
THE wide circle of human society is diversified by an end,
less variety of characters, dispositions, and passions. Uniformity is, in no respect, the genius of the world. Every man is
marked by some peculiarity which distinguishes him from
another: and no where can two individuals be found, who
nre exactly and in -all respects, alike.  Where so much diversity obtains, it cannot but happen, that in the intercourse
which men are obliged to mnaintain, their tempers will often
be ill adjusted to that intercourse; will jar, and interfere with
each other.  Hence, in every station, the highest as well as
the lowest, and in every condition of life, public, private, and
domestic, occasions of irritation freqnently arise.  We are
plrovoked, sometimes, by the folly and levity of those with
whom- we are connected; sometimes, by their indifference
or neglect; by the incivility of a friend, the haughtiness of a
superior, or the insolent behaviour of cne in lower station.
Itardly a day passes, without somewhat or other occuring,
which serves to ruffle the man of impatient spirit.  Of course,
such a man lives in a continual stormin.  He knows not what
it is to enjoy- a train of good humour.  Servants, neighbours,
friends, spouse, and children, all, through the unrestrained
violence of his temper, become sources of disturbance and
vexation to him.  In vain is affluence; in vain are health a:d
prosperity.  The least trifle is sufficient to discompose hif
mind, and poison his pleasures.  His very amusements are
mixed with turbulence and passion.
I would beseech this man to consider, of what small roment the provocations which he receives, or at least least imagines
himself to receive, are really in themselves; but of what
great moment he malkes them, by suffering them to deprive
himn of the possession of himself.  I wouild beseech him, to
consider, how many hours of happir.ess he throws away,
-which a little more patience wouldP allow him to enjoy: and
howr much he puts it in the power of the most in'significant701                 The English Reader.             Part I
persons to render him mI.,erable.  "But.who can expect,"
we hear him exclaim, "that he is to possess theinsensibility
of a stone? How is it possible for human nature to endure so
many repeated provocations? or to bear calmly with so uinreasonable behaviour?"--'My brother! if thou canst bear with
no instances of unreasonable  behaviour. withdraw thyself
from the world.  Thou art no longer fit to live in it.  Leave
the intercourse-of men.  Retreat to the mountain,  and the
desert; or shut thyself up in a cell.  For hire, in the nidst
of society, ofences must' com)e.  We rmi 1lt as wei expect,
when we behold a calm atmosphere, anda cfti' sxv, tat no
clouds were ever to rise2 and no winds to bow, t;s'i:at ou'r
life were long to proceed, without receiving provo.ations from
human frailty.  The careless and the imprudent, the giddy
and tlie/fickle, tie ungrateful and the interested, every where
meet us.  They are the briers and thorns, with whlich the
paths of human life are beset.  He only, who can hold his
course among them with patience and eqlanimity, he who is
prepa:ied to bear what he must expect to happen, is worthy
of the name of a man.
If we preserved ourselves composed but for a mnoment, we
should perceive the insignificancy of most of those provoca
tions which we magnify so highly.  When a few suns more
have rolled over our heads,, the storm will, of itself, have
subsided; the cause. of our present impatience and distuirbance will be utterly forgotten.  Can we not then, anticipate
this hour of calmness to ourselv-es; and begin to enjoy the
peace which it will certainly bring? If otfhers have behaved
Improperly, let us leave them to their own folly, without becoming the victim of their caprice, and punishing ourselves on
their account.-Patience, in this exercise of it, cannot be too
much studied by all who wish their life to flow in a smooth
stream.  It is tie reason of a man, in opposition to the passion
of a child.  It is the enjoyment of peace, in opposition to
uproar and confusion.. LAIR,

THE active mind of man seldomn  or nc,'er rests satisfied
with its present condition, hlow prosperous soever. Originally
formed for a wider range of objects, for a hi,her sphere of
enjoyments, it finds itself, in every situation of fortune,
straitened and confined.  Sensible of deficiency in its state, it
is,ever sendinrg forth fh  find desire, t:he aspiring wish, afterChatp. 3.             Didactic Pieces.                   71
something berond what is enjoyed at present.  Hence, that
restlessnjss which prevails so generally among mankind.
Hence, that disgust of pleasures which they tave tried; that
passion for novelty; that ambition of rising to some degree of
eminence or felicity, of which they have formed tc themselves
an indistinct idea. All which may be considered as indications of a certain native, original greatness in the human soul,
swelling beyond the limits of its present condition; and pointing to the higher objects for which it was made. Happy, if
these latent remains of our primitive state, served to direct
our wishes towards their proper destination, and to lead us
into the path of true bliss.
But in this dark and bewildered state, the aspiring tendency
of our nature unfortunately takes an opposite direction, and
feeds a very misplaced ambition. The flattering appearances
which here present themselires to sense; the distinctions
which fortune confers; the advantages and pleasures which
we imagine the world to be capable of bestowing, fill up the
ul1`mate wish of most men.  These are the objects which engross their solitary musings, and stimulate their active labours
which warm the breasts of the young, animate the industry of
the middle aged, and often keep alive the passions of the old,
until the very close of life.
Assuredly, there is nothing unlawful in our wishing to be
freed from whatever is disagreeable, and to obtain a f'ller
enjoyment of the comforts of life. But when these wishes
are not tempered by reason, they are in danger of precipitating us into much extravagance and folly. Desires and wishes
are the first springs of action.  WhtA  they become exorbitant, the whole character is likely to be tainted. If we suffer our fancy to create to itself worlds of ideal happiness, we
shall discompose the peace and order of our minds, and fo
ment many hurtful passions.  I-ere, then, let moderation
begin its reign; by bringing within reasonable bounds the
wishes that we form. As soon as they become extravagant,
let us check them, by proper reflections on the fallacious nature of those objects, which the world hangs out to allure
desire.
You have strayed, my friends, from the road which conducts
to felicity;, you have dishonoured the native dignity of your
souls, in allowing your wishes to terminate on nothing higher
than worldly ideas ofgreatness or happiness.  Your imagination roves in a land of shadows. Unreaf forms deceive you. It
is no more than a phantom, an illu^ion  of happiness, which7-                   TDte English Reader.           Part 1.
attracts your fond admiration; nay, an illusion of happiness,
which often conceals much real misery.
Do you imagine that all are happy, who have attained to
those summits of distinction, towards which your wishes aspire? Alas! how  frequently has experience shown, that
where roses were supposed to bloom, nothing but briers and
thorns grew! Reputation, beauty, riches, grandeur, nay, royalty
itself, would, many a time, have been gladly exchanged by
the possessors, for that more (quiet and humble station, with
which you are nowv dissatisfied. "With all that is splendid and
shining in the world, it is decreed that there should mix many

the great calamities of-life chiefly fall.  There, the storm
spends its violence, and there, the thunder breaks; while,

extravyagant desire.  Satisfy yourselves with what is rational
and attainable.  Train your minds to moderate views of humnan life, and human happiness. - Remember,; and admire, the
wisdom of Agur's petition: " Remove far from  me vanity:nd -lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches.  Feed me;vith food convenient for me: lest 1I be full and deny thee;
irid say, who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal; and:ake the name of my God in vain."                  BLAIR.

Olnniscience and omnipresence of the DEITY, the source of consolation to good men.
I was yesterday, about sun-set, walking in the open fields,
till the night insensibly fell upon me.  I at first amused my-;elf with all the richness and variety of colours, which ap)eared in the western parts of heaven. In proportion as they
aded awav and went out, several stars and planets appeared.ne after another, till the whole firmament was in a glow.
The blueness of the ether was exceedingly heightened and
enlivened, by the season  of the year, and the rays of all
these luminaries that passed through it.  The galaxy appear.
ed in its most beautiful white.  To complete the scene, the
filli moon rose, at length, in that clouded majesty, which
il-'on takes notice of; and opened to the eye a new picture
of nature, which was more finely'shaded,,and disposed
among softer lights than that which the sun had before disco,.,ered to us,As I was surveying the moon walking in her brightness,
and taking her progress among the constelations, a thought
arose in me, which I believe very often perplexes and disturbs
men of serious and contemplative natures.  David himself
fell into it in that reflection; "When I consider the heavens,
the work of. thy fingers; the moon and the stars which thou
hast ordained; what is man that thoiu art mindftll of him, and
the son ~of man that tthou regardest him!" In the same mainner, when I considered that infinite host of stars, or, to speak
more philosophically, of suns, which were then shining upon
me; with those ininumerable sets of planets or worlds, which
were moving round their relpective suns; when I still enlarged the idea, and supposed another heaven of suns and -
worlds, rising still above this whlich we discovered; and
these still enlightened by a superier firmament of luminaries,
which:tre planted at so great a distance, that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former, as the stars do to  s:
in short, while I pursued this thou,ght, I could not but reflect
on that little insignifictlt figure which I myself bore amidst
the immensity of God's works.
-Were the sun, which enligh,tens this part of the creation,
with all the host of planetarv  worlds tha.t move above him,
utterly extinguishedand annihilated, they would not be missed,
more than a grain of sand tpon the sea-shore.  The space
they possess is so exceedingly littl- in comparison of the
whole, it would scarcely male a bltank in the creation.  7'he
chasm would be imperceptible to an eye, that could take in
the whole compnss of nature, and pass fron one end of the
creation to the other; as it is possible there may be such a
sense in ourselves  hereaifter, or in creatulres whi.ch. are at
present more exalted than ourtselves.  By tihe lielp of glasses,
we see many stars, which we dl not discover with our nmilked
eyes; and the liner our telescopes a;re, tie more still are our

it?

73  under his care and superintendency.  I was afraid of being
overlooked amidst the immensity of nature; and lost among
that infinite variety of creatures, which, in all probability,
swarm through all these immeasurable regidns of matter.
In order to recover myself from this mortifying thought, I
considered that it took its rise from those narrow conceptions,
which we are apt to entertain of the Divine Nature.  We
ouarselves cannot attend to many different objects at the s:ime
time.  If we are careful to inspect some things, we must of
course neglect others.  This imperfection which we observe
in ourselves, is an imperfection that cleaves, in some degree,
to creatures of the highest capacities, as they are creatures,
that is, beings of finite and limited natures.  The presence
of every created being is confined to a certain measure of
space; and consequently his observation is stinted to a certain
number of objects.  The sphere in which we move, and act;
and understand, is of a wider circumference to one creature,
thtan another, according as we rise one above another in the
scale of existence. But the widest of these our spheres has
its circumference.  When, therefore, we reflect on the Divine Nature, we are so used and accustomed to this- imperfection in ourselves, that we cannot forbear, in some measure,
ascribing it to HIM, in whom there is no shadow of imperfection.  Our reason indeed assures us, that his attributes are
infinite; but the poorness of our conceptions is such, that it
cannot forbear setting bounds to every thing it contemplates,
till our reason comes again to our succour, and throws down
all those little prejudices, which rise in us unawares, and are
natural to the mind of man.
We shall therefore utterly extinguish this melancholy
thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker, in the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of those objects among
which he seems to be incessantly employed, if we consider,
in the first place, that he is omnipresent; and in the second,
that he is omnisciont.
-' If we consider him in his omnipresence, his being passes
through, actuates, and supports, the whole frame of nature:
His creation, in every part of it, is full of him. There is nohinLg he has made, which is either so distant, so little, or so
Inconsiderable, that he does not-essentially reside in it. IHis
substance is within the substance of every being, whether material or immater.al, and as intimately present to it, as that
being is to itself.  It would be an imperfection- in him, were
he able to move eut of one place into another; or to witl-

Part 1.draw himself from any thing he has created, or from any part
of that space which he diffused and spread abroad to infinity.
In short, to speak of him in the language of the old pbilosophers, he is a being whose centre is every where, and his circumference no where.
In the second place, he is omniscient as well as omnipresent.
His omniscience, indeed, necessarily and naturally flows from
his omnipresence.  He cannot but be conscious of every motion that arises in the whole material world, which he thus
essentially pervades; and of every thought that is stirring in
the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united.  Were the soul separated from the body, and
should it with one glance of thought start beyond the bounds
of the creation; should it for millions of years, continue its
progress through infinite space, with the same activity, it
would still find itself within the emu race of its Creator, and
encompassed by the immensity of the Godhead.
In this consideration of the Almighty's omnipresence rand
omniscience, every uncomfortable thought vanishes.  He cannot but regard every thing that has being, especially such of
his creatures who fear they are not regairded by him. He is
privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this occasion; for, as
it is impossible he should overlook any of his creatures, so we
may be confident that he regards with an eye of mercy, those
who enrdeavour to recommend themselves to his notice; and
in unfeigned humility of heart, think themselves unworthy
that he shoul-d be mindful of them.                 ADDISON.

Happiness is founded in rectitude of con.duct.
ALL men pursue good, and would be happy, if they knew
how: not happy for minutes, and miserable for hoirs; but
happy, if possible, through every part of their existence. Either, therfoere, there is a good of this steady, durable kind, or
ther-e i not.  If not, then all good must be transient and uncertnia; and if so, an object of t!e lowest value, whicis can
little deserve our attention or int iry.  But if there 1be a better good, such a good'as we are seeking; like every other

must either be external, internal, or mixed; in as much as, except these three, there is no other possible. Now,a steady,
durable good, cannot be derived from an external cause; since
all derived friom  externals mnust fluctuate as they fluctuate.
By the same rule, it cannot be derived from a mixture of the
two; because the part which is external, wvill proportionably
destroy its essence. -What then remains but the cause interial? the very cause which -we have supposed, when we place

Virtue atnd piety man's highest interest.
I FIND myself existing upon a little spot, surrounded every
way by an immense unknown  expansion.--Where am I?
What sort of place do I inhabit? Is it exactly accommodated
in every instance to my convenience? Is there no excess of
cold, none of heat, to offend me? Am  I never annoyed by
animals, either of my own, or a different kind?-Is every thing
subservient to me, as though I had ordered all myself? Nonothing like it-the farthest from it possible.  The world appears not, then, orginallyv made for the private conVenience
of me alone?--It does net.  But is it not possible so to accommodate it, by my ovwn particular industry? If to accommodate man and beast, heaven and earth, if this be beyond me,
it is not possible. WVhat consequence t1hen followTs; or can
there be any other tnan this -:f I seek an interest of my own
detached from thait of others, I seek an interest which is chimerical, and which can never have -existence.
How then must I determine? Have I no interest at all-? It
I have not, I am  stationed here to no purpose.  But why no
interest? Can I be contented witlh none but one separate and
detached? Is a social interest, joined wvith others, such an
absurditv as n6t to be admitted? The bee, the beaver, and
the tribes of herding, animals, are sufficient to convince me,
that the thing is somewhere at least possible.  How, then, am
I assured that it is not equally true of man? -Admit it; and
whhat follows? If so, then honour and justice are my interest;
then the whole train of moral virtues are my interest; without
some portion of which, not even thieves can maintain society.
Bur, farther still-I stop not here--I pursue this social interest as far as I can trace my several rclations. I pass from
my own stock, my own neighbourhood, my own nation, to thefCiap. 4.           Srgumenratlve Pieces.'77
whole race of mankind, as dispersed throughout the earth.
Am I not related to them all, by the mutual aids of commerce, by the general intercourse of arts and letters, by that
common nature of which we all participate?
Again--. I must have food and clothing.  Without a proper
genial warmth, I instantly perish. Am I not related, in this
view, to the very earth itself; to the distant sun, from whose
beams I derive vigour? to that stupendous course and order
of the infinite host of heaven, by which the times, and seasons
ever uniformly pass on? Were this order once confounded,
I could not probably survive a moment; so absolutely do I depend on this common general welfare.  What, then, have I
to do, but to enlarge virtue into piety? Not only honour and
justice, and what I owe to nman, is my interest; but gratitude
also, acquiescence, resignation, adoration, and all I owe to
this great polity, and its great Governor our common Parent.

SECTION III.
Thie injustice of an uncharitable spirit.
A susPicious, uncharitable spirit is not only inconsistent with
all social virtue and happiness, but it is also, in itself, unreasonable and unjus.t. In order to form sound opinions concerning characters and actions, two things are especially requisite,
information and impartiality.  But such as are most forward.
to decide unfavourably, are commonly destitute of both.  Instead of possessing, or even requiring, full information, the
grounds on which they proceed are frequently the most slight
aud frivolous. A tale, perhaps, which the idle have invented,
the inquisitive have listened to, and the credulous have propagated; or a real incident which'rumour, in carrying it
tlong, has exaggerated and disguised, suppli'es them with materials of confident assertion, and decisive judgment. From
an action they presently look into the heart, and infer the
motive.  This supposed motive they conclude to be the
ruling principle; and pronounce at once concerning the whole
character.
Nothing can be more contrary both to equity and to sound
reason, than this precipitate judgment.  Any man who at- tends to what passes within himself, may easily discern what
a complicated system the human characteris; and what a
variety of circumstances must be taken into the account, ia
order to estimate it truly. No single instance of conduct
whatever, is sufficient to determine it. As from one worthy
G 2SECTION L
Proper loudne2s of Voice.
THE first attention of every person who reads to others, doubtless, must
be, to rmake himseff be heard by all those to whom he reads. He must
endeavour to fill with his voice the space occupied hy the company. This
power of voice, it may be thought, is wholly a natural talent. It is, in a
good measure, the gift of nature; but it may receive considerable assist
ance fromn art. Much depends, for this purpose, on the proper pitch and
mana,gement of the voice. Every person has three pitches in his voice;
the HIGI, the MIDDLE, and the Low one. The high, is that which he uses
in calling aloud to some person at a distance. The low is, when he ap
proaches to a whisper. The middle is, that which he employs*n common
conversation, and which he should generally use in reading to others. For
it is a great mistake, to imagine that one must take the highest pitch of his
voice, in order to be well heard in a large company. This is confounding
two things which are different, loudness or strength of sound, with the key
or note on which we speak. There is a variety of soundVwithin the compass of each key. A speaker may therefore renderhis voice louder, without altering the key: and we shall always be able to give most body, most
persevering force of sound, to that pitch of voice, to which in conversation
we are accustomed. Whereas by setting out on our highest pitch or key,
we certainly allow ourselves less compass, and are likely to strain our voice
before we have done. We shall fatigue ourselves, and read with pain; and
whenever a person speaks with pain to himself, he is always heard with
pain by his audience. Let us therefore give the, voice full strength and
swell of sound; but always pitch it on our ordinary speaking key. It
Ahould be a constant rule never to utter a greater quantity of voice than'
we can afford without pain to oursdlvds, and without any extraordinary
effort. As long as we keep within these bounds, the other o&amp;rgans of speech
will be at liherty to discharge their several offices wit4 ease; and we shall
always have our voice under command. But whenever we transgress
these bounds, we give up the reins, and have no longer any management of
it. It is a useful rule too, in order to be well heard, to cast our eye on
some of the most distant persons in the company, and to consider ourselves
as reading to them. Wve naturally and mechanically utter our words with
such a degree of stirength, as-to make ourselves be heard by the person
whom we address, provided he is within the reach of our voice. As this is
the case in conversation, it will hold also in reading to others. But let us
reemember, that in reading, as well as in conversation, it is possible to offend by speaking too loud. This extreme hurts the ear, by making the voice
conie upon it in rumbling, ildistiqct masses.
I By the habit of reading, when young, in a loud and vehement manner,
the voice becor es fixed in a strained and unnatural key; and is rendered
incapab'le of that variety of elevation and depression which constitutes the
true harmoiny of Iutterance, and affords ease to the reader, and pleasure to
the audiernce. Thisunnatural pitch of the voice, and disagreeable monotoeny, are miost observable in persons who weire taught to read in large rooms;
who were accustomed to stand at too great a distance, when reading to
their teachers; whose instrleters were very imperftct in their Iearing,; or
wio were titnght'by pt'soas, that considered. loud e.prresionu as the  h.hief78''te Elnglsh Reader.               Part I
action, it were credulity, not charity, to conclude a person to
be free from all vice; so frQm one which is censurable, it is
perfectly unjust to infer that the author of it is without conscience, and without merit.  If we knew all the attending
circumstances, it might appear in an excusable light; nay,
perhaps, under a commendable form. The motives of the actor may have been entirely different from those which we ascribe to him; and where we suppose him impelled by bad design, he may have been prompted by conscience and, mistaken
principle.  Admitting the action to have been in every view
criminal, he may have been hurried into it through inadver-tency and surprise.  He may have sincerely repented; and
the virtuous principle may have now regained its full vigour.
Perhaps this was the corner of frailty; the quarter on which
he lay open to the incursions of temptation; while the other
avenues of his hear( were firmly guarded by conscience.
It is therefore evident, that no part of the government of
temper deserves attention more, than to keep our minds pure
firom uncharitable prejudices, and open to candour and humnanity in judging of others.  The worst consequences, both
to ourselves and to society, follow from the opposite spirit.
BLAIR.
SECTION IV.
Thle misfortunes of men mostly chargeable on themselves.
WE find man placed in a world, where he has by no means
the disposal of the events that happen. Calamities sometimes
befall the worthiest and the best, which it is not in their power
to prevent, and where nothing is left-them, but to acknowledge, and to submit to, the high hand of Heaven.  For such
visitations of trial, many good and wise reasons can be assigned, which the present subject leads me not to discuss.
But though those unavoidable calamities make a part, yet
they make not the chief part, of the vexations and sorrows
that distress human life.  A multitude of evils beset us, for
the source of which we must look to another quarter.--No
sooner has any thing in the health, or in the circumstances of
men, gone cross to their wish, than they begin to talk of the
unequal distribution of the good things of this life; they envy
the condition of others; they repine at their own lot, and!
fret against the Ruler of the world.
Full of these sentiments, one man pines under a broken
constitution.  But let us ask him, whether he can, flirly and
hlonetly, as-sign no cause itr this but the unknown decree otCha?p. 4.4-,-eirnntent/ive Pzeces.            79
heaven? Has -he duly valued the blessing of- health, and always observed the rules of virtue and sobriety? Has he been
moderate in his life, and temperate in all his pleasures? If
now he is only paying the price of his former, perhaps his
forgotten indulgences, has he any title to complain, as if he
were suffering unjustly? Were we to survey the chambers of
sickness and distress, we should often find them peopled with
the victims of intemperance and sensuality, and with the children of vicious indolence and, sloth.  Among the thousands
who languish there, we should find the proportion of innocent sufferers to be small.  We should see flded youthl, premature old age, and the prospect of an untimely grave, to be
the portioni of multitudes, who, in one way or other, have
brought those- evils on themselves; while yet these martyrs
of vice and folly have the assurance to arraign the hard fate
of man. and to " fret against the Lord."
But you, perhaps, complain of hardships of another kind;
of the injustice of the world; of the poverty which you suffer, and the discouragements under which you labour; of the
crosses and disappointments of which your life has been
doomed to be full.- Before you give too much scope to your
discontent, let me desire vou to reflect impartially upon'your
past train of life. Have not sloth or pride, or ill temper, or
Sinful passions, misled you oftefi from the path of sound and
wise conduct? Have you-not been waeting to yourselves in
improving those oltortunities which Providence offered you,
for bettering and advancing' your state? If you have chosen
to indulge your humour, or your taste, in the gratifications of
indolence or pleasure, can you complain because others, in
preference to you, have obtained th4se advantages which
naturally belong to useful labpurs, and honourable pursuits?
Have not the consequences of some false steps, into which
vour passions, or your pleasures, have betrayed you, pursued
you through much of your life; tainted, perhaps, your charac.
ters, involved you in embarrassments, or sunk you into neglect?--It is an old saying, that every man is the artificer of.
his own fortune in the world.  It is certain, that the world
seldom  turns wholly against a man, unless through his own
fault.  " Religion is," in general, C" profitable unto all tlings.".
Virtue, diligence, and industry, joined with good temper- and
prudence, have ever been found the surest road to prosperity;
and where men fail of attaining it, their want of success is
far oftener owing to their having deviated from that road,
than to their having encountered insuperable bars in it.
Some,  by beilg too artful, forfeit t -he reputaton of probity

Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in prudence.
Others, by being fickle and changeable, are distrusted by all.
The case commonly is, that men seek to ascribe their disappointments to any cause, rather than to their own miscon-.
duct; and when they can devise no other cause, they lay
them to the charge of Providence.  Their folly leads them
into vices; their- vices into misfortunes; and in their misfortunes they "murmur against Providence." They are doubly
unjust towards their Creator.  In their prosperity, they are
apt to ascribe their success to their own diligence, rather
than to his blessing: and in their adversity, they impute their
distresses to his providence, not to their own misbehaviour.
Whereas, the truth is the very reverse of this.  "Every good
and every perfect gift cometh from above.;" and of evil and
misery, man is the author to himself.
When, from the condition of individuals, we look abroad
to the public state of the world, we meet with more proofs
of the truth of this assertion.  We see great societies of men
torn in pieces by intestine dissensions, tumults, and civil commotions.  We see mighty armies going forth, in formidable
array, against each other, to cover the earth with blood, and
to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils
these are, to which this miserable world is exposed.-But are
these evils, I beseech you, to be imputed to God? Was it
he who sent forth slaughtering armies into the field, or whc
filled the peaceful city with massacres an blood? Are thcsc
miseries any other than the bitter fruit of men's violent ant
disorderly passions? Are they not clearly to be traced to th.
ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great.
and to the turbulence of the people?-Let us lay thenl entirely out of the accotint, in thinking of Providence; and let
us think only of the " foolishness of man."  Did man control
his passions, and form his conduct according to the dictates of
wNisdom, humanity, and virtue, the earth would no longer be
lesolated by cruelty; and human societies would live in order, harmony, and peace.  In those scenes, of mischief and
violence which fill the world, let man behold, with shame, the
picture of his vices, his ignorance, and folly.  Let him be
humbled by the mortifying view of his own perverseness; but'et not his " heart fret against the Lord."       BLAIR.
SECTION  V.
On disinterested friendship.
I AM informed that certain Greek writers (philosophers, it
teems, in the opinion of their countrymen) have advancedJhap. 4.             rgztcme,ntatiie P ecc.                81
some very extraordinary positions relating to friendship; as,
indeed, what s-ubject is there, which these subtle geniuses
have not tortured with their sophistry?
The authors to wihom I refer, dissuade their disciples from
entering into any strong attachm-ents, as unavoidably creating
supernumerary disquietudes to those who engage in them;
and, as every man has more than sufficient to call forth his
solicitude, in the course qf his own affairs, it is a weakness,
they contend, anxiously to involve himself in the concerns-of
others.  They recomrmei:1 it also, in all coilnexions of this
kind, to hold the bands of' union extremely loose; so as always
to have it in one's power to straiten or relax them, as circumstances and situations shall render most expedient.  They
add, as a capital article of their doctrline, that, " to live exempt
from cares, is an essential ingredient to constitute human happiness: but an ingredient, however, which he, who voluntarily
distresses himself with cares, in which he has no necessary
and personal interest, must never hope to possess."
I have been told likewise, that there is another set of pretended philosophers, of the same country, whose tenets, concerning this subject, are of a still more illiberal and ungenerolls cast.
The proposition they attempt to establish, is, that " friendship is an affair of self-interest entirely; and that the proper
motive for engaging in -it, is, not in order to gratify th'e kind
and benevolent affections, but for the benefit of that assistance and support which are to be derived from the connexion."  Accordingly they assert, that those persons are mnost
disposed to have recourse to auxiliary alliances of tilis kind,
wvho are least qualified by nature, or fortune, to depend upon
their own strength and powers: the weaker sex, for,instance,
being generally mrore inclined to engage in friendships, than
the male part of our species; and those who are depressed
by indi,ence, or labhourinc  under misfortunes,  than the
wealthy and the prosperous.
Excellent and obligirg sages, these, undoubtedly! To
strike out the friendly aiectiorns fi'om the moral world, would
be like extinguishingr the sun in the nattura l; eack-h of them

rejected with the utmost disdain   For nothing, surely, can be
more inconsistent with a we!l-poised and manly spirit, than to
decline engaging in any laudable action, or to be discouraged
from persevering in it, by an apprehension of the trouble and
solicitude, with which it may probably be attended. Virtue herself, indeed, ought to be totally renounced, if it be right to'
avoid every possible means th:at'may be prodluctive of uneasiness: for who, that is actuated by her principles, can observe
the conduct of an opposite character, without being affected
with some degree of secret dissatisfaction? Are not the just, the
brave, and the good, necessarily exposed to the disagreeable
emotions of dislike and aversion, when they respectively meet
with instances of fraud, of cowardice, or of villany? It is an
essential property of every well-constituted mind, to be affected with pain, or pleasure, according to the nature of those
moral appearances that present themselves to observation.
If sensibility, therefore, be not incompatible with true wisdom, (and it surely is not, unless we suppose that philosophy
deadens every finer.faeling of our nature,) what just reason
can be assigned; why the sympathetic sufferings which may
result from friendship, should be a sufficient inducement for
banishing that generous affection from  the human breast?
Extinguish all emotions of the heart, and what difference will
remain, I do not say between man and brute, but between
man and a mere inanimate clod? Awvay then with those au-.
stere philosophers, who represent virtue as hardening the soul
against all the softer impressions of humanity. L:he fict, certainly, is much otherwise.  A truly good man is\upon many
occasions, extremely sulsceptible of tender sentiments; and
his heart expands with joy, or shrinks with sorrow, as good
or ill fortilne accompanies his friend.  Upon the whole, then,
it may ftkirlv be concluded, that, as in the case of virtue, so
in that of friendship, those painful sensations, which may
sometimes be produced by the one, as well as by the other,
are equally insufficient grounds for excluding  either of them
from taking possession of our bosoms.
They who insist that " utility is the first and prevailing motive, which induces mankind to enter into particular fiten,dships," appear to me to divest the associaticn of its most ainaible and engaging principle.  For to a mind rightly disposed,
it is not so much the benefits received, as the affectionate zeal
from which they flowr, that gives them their best and mlost
_valuable recom-iendation.  It is so far indeed ftorn being
verified by fact, that a sense of our wvants is the ori&amp;unal causeC/hap. 4.            flrrgumentatizve Pieces.               3
of forming these amicable alliances; that, on the contrary, it
is observable, that none have been more distinguished in their
friendships than those, whose power and opulence, but, above
all, whose superior virtue, (a much firmer support,) have raised them above every necessity of having recourse to the assistance of others.
The true distinction then, in this question, is, that " although
friendship is certainly productive of utility, yet utility is not
the primary motive of firiendship." Those selfish sensualists,
therefore, who, lulled in the lap of luxury, presume to main-.
tain the reverse, have surely no claim to attention; as they
are neither qualificd by reflection, nor experience, to be competent judges of the subject.
Is there a man upon the face of the earth, who would deliberately accept- of all the wealth, and all the affluence this
world can bestow, if offered to him upon the severe terms of
his being unconnected with a single mortal- whom  he could
love, or by whom he should be beloved? This would be to
lead the wretched life of a detested tyrant, who, amidst perpetual suspicions and alarms, passes his miserable days a
stranger to every tender sentiment; and utterly precluded
from the heart-felt satisfactions of friendship.. VIe/moth's translation of Cicero's Lceliu?s.
SECTION  VI........ -&gt;] On the immortality of the soul.
I WAS yesterday walking alone, in one of my friend's woods;
and lost myself in it very agreeably, as I was running over, in
my mind, the several arguments that establish this great
point; which is the basis of morality, and the source of all
the pleasing hopes, and secret joys, that can arise in the heart
of a resonable creature. I considered those several proofs
drawn,
First, from the nature of the soul itself, and particularly its
immateriality; which, though not absolutely necessary to the
eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almost
a demonstration.
Secondly, from its passions and sentiments; as, particfiarly, from its love of existence; its horror of annihilation; and
its hopes of immortality; with that secret satisfhction which
it finds in the practice of virtue; and that uneasiness which
follows upon the commission of vice.84                   XThe English Reader.            Part.
Thirdly, from  the nature' of thb  Supreme Being, whose
justice, goodness, wisdom, and veracity, are all concerned in
this point.
But among these, and other excellent arguments for the
immortality of the~ soul, there is one drawn from the perpetual
progress of the soul to its perfection,  without a possibility of
ever arriving, at it; which is a hint that I do not remember
to have seen opened and improved by others, who have written on this slublject, though it seems to n-e to carry at very
great weight with it. HI-ow can it enter into the thoughts of
man, that the soul, which is capable of immense perfections,
and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, shall fall
away into nothing, almost as soon as it is created? Are such
abilities made for no purpose? A brute arrives at a point of
perfection, that lie can never pass: in a few years he has all
lhe endowmnents he is cap:ble of; and were he to live ten
thousand more, would be the same thing he is at present.
Were a humarn soul thus at a stand in her accomplishments;
were her factieies to be full blown, and incapable of farther
enlargements; I could imagine she mni:'ht fill away insensibly, and drop at once into a state of annihilation.  But can'
we believe a thinking being that is in a perpetaal progress of
improvement, and travelling on from perfection to perfection,
after having just looked abroad into the works of her Creator,
and made a few  discoveries of his infinite goodness, wisdom,
and power, must perish at her first settinlg out, and in the
very begnninr of her inquiries?
Man, considered only in his present state, seems sent into
the world merely to propagate his kind.  Hie provides himself
with a successor; and immediately quits his post to make
room for him.  Ile does not seem born to enjoy life, but to
deliver it down to others.  This is not surprisina to consider in
animals, which are formed for our use, and whichi can finish
their business in a short life.  The silk wornm, after having
spun her task, lays her egs and dies.  But a man c;nnot thk e
in his full measure of knowledre, has not timne to subdie liis
passions, establish his soul in virtue,.and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hwrried off the stage. Would
an infinitely wise Seing malke such glorious creatures for so
mnean a purrpose? Can he deliht in the production of such
abortive intalligences, such short-lived reasonable beinzs?
Would he give us talents th;t are not to be exerted? calpa.cities that. are nerer to be gratified 9':ow", can we find. that

of man, without lo6king on this world as only a nursery for
the next; and without believing that the several generations
of rational creatures, which rise up and disappear in such
quick successions, are only to receive their first rudiments of
existence here, and afterwards to be transplanted into a more
friendly climate, where they may spread and flourish to all
eternity?
There is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion, than this %f the perpetual progress, which the soul makes towards the perfection of its riature, without ever arriving at a period in it.' To looki upon
the soul as going on from strength to strength; to consider
that she is to shine -for ever with new accessions of glory,
and brighten to al,l eternity; that she will be still adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge; carries in -it
somethbing,.wonderfully agreeable to that ambition, which is
natural'to th'e mind -of man.  Nay, it must be a prospect.
pleasing to God himself, to see his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes; and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of resemblance.             -   i
Metbinks this single consideration, of the progress:of a finite
spirit to perfection, will be sfifficie-ft to extinguish all envy in
inf~'r natures, and all contempt in superior.  That cherub,:wh:.iow  appears as a god to a human soul, knows very well
that:Ue period will come about in eternity, when the human
soul shall be as pOerfect as he himself now is,: nav, when she
shall look dowvn  pon that degree of perfection as much as
she now falls short of it.  It is true, the' higher nature still
advances, and by that means preserves his distance' ad superiority in the scale of being; but' he knows that, how high
soever-the station is of which hb- stands possessed at present,
the inferior nature will, at length, mount up to it; -nd shine
forth in the same degree of glory.
With what astonishmeht and veneration, may we look into
our own souls, where there are such hidden stores of virtue
and knowledge, such inexhausted sources of perfecti: on  We,
know not yet what we shall be; nor will it ever e't into:
the heart' of man, to conceive the glgry that will be alwaysin
reserve for him. - The souil, considered with its Creator, is
like one of those mathematical lines, that may draw nearer to
another for all eternity, -without a possibility of touching it:
and can there be a thought so transporting, as to consider ourse:e:sin these perpetual approhes to HIM, who is'the standard not oly of perfection, tt oAhappines s?     ADDIbOr./              CHAPTER V..

vThe Seasons.
A-MONG the great.lessings and wonders of the cre;ation, may
be cla.sed- the regularities of times and seasons.  Immediately
after the flood, the sacred promise was nmade to man, that seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and
nighlt, should continue to the very end of allI.things. Accordingly, in obedience to that promise, the rotation is constantly
presenting us with some useful and agreeable alteration; and
all the pleasing novelty of life arises from these natijrai: changes:
nor are we less indebted to them for many of its solid comforts.
It has been frequently the task of the moralist and poet,- to
mark, in polished periods, the particular charms and' conveniences of every change; and, indeed, such discriminate observations upon natural variety,.cannot be undelightful; l,since thle.
blessing which every month brings -long *with it, is a. fresh instance of the wisdom  and bounty of that Providence,T-hich
regulates the glories of the year.  We glow as we'mplate.; we feel a propensity to adore, whilst we enjoy. I'nthe
time of seed-sow'ing, it is the season of confidence: the grain
which the husbandman trusts to the bosom of the earth shall,
iaply, yield its seven-fold rewards.  Spring presents us with
a scene of lively expectation. That which was before sown,
begins now to discover signs of successful vegetation.  The
labourer observes the change, and anticipates the harvest; he
watches the progress of nature, and smiles at her influ.ence:
while the man of contemplation walks forth with the- evening,
amidst the fragrance of flowers, and promises of plenty; hor
returns:o his cottage till darkness closes the scene upon his
eye   Then cometh. the harvest, when the large wish is satisfled, and the granaries of nature are loaded with the means of
life, even to a luxury of abundance.  The, powers- of language
are unequal to the description of this happy season. It is the
carnival of nature: sun and shade, coolness and quietude,
cheerfulness and melody, love and gratitude, unite to render
every scene of summer delightful.  The division ofltght and
darkness is one of the kindest.efforts of Omnipotent Wisdom

time, assist each other, by giving fresh lustre to the delights of
both. Amidst the glare of day, and bustle of life, how could we
sleep? Amidst the gloom of darkness, how coidd we labour?
How wise, how benignant, then, is the proper division! The
hours of light are adapted to activity; and those of darkness,
to rest. Ere the day is passed, exercise and nature prepare
us for the pillow; and by the time that the morning returns,
we are again able to meet it with a smile.  Thus, every season has a charm peculiar to itself;:t/ery moment affords
some interesting innovation.                       MELMOTrI.

2We cataract of.Niagara, in Canada, North itmefeca.
T-IS amazing fall of water is made by the river St. Lawrence, in its passage from lake Erie into tAhe lake Ontario.
The St. Lawrence is one of the largest rivers in the world;
and yet the whole of its waters is discharged in this place, by
a fall of a hundred and fifty feet perpendicular.  It is not
easy to b-ring the imagination to correspond to the greatness of
the scene.  A rirer extremly deep and rapid, and thatserves
to drain the waters of -almost all North America ino the Atlanti.c Ocean, is here poulred precipitately down -a ledge of
rocks, that rises, like a wall, acress the whole bed of its stream,
The river, a little above, is near three quartern of a mile
broad; and the rocks, where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over.  Their direction is not straight across, but
hollowing inwards like a horse-shoe: so that the cataract,
which bends to the shape of the obstacle, rounding -tivards,
presents a kind of theatre the most tremendous in nature.
Just in the middle'of this circular wall of waters, -a little island,
that has braved the fury of the current, presents one of its
points, and divides the stream at top into two parts; but they
unite again long before they reach the bottom.  The noise of
the faill is heard at the distance of several leagues; and the
fury of the waters, at the termination of their fall, is inconceivable.  The dashing produces a mist that rises to the very
clouds; and which forms a most beautiful rainbow, when the
sun shines. It will be readily supposed, that such a cataract
entirely destroys the navigation of the stream; and yet some
Indians in their canoes, as it is said, have ventured down it
with safety.                                      GOLDSMITH.

*    -    tDidsindness.
In the nextplace, to being well heard and clearlyunderstood, distinctness
of articulation contributes more than mere loudness of sound. The quatntity of sound necessary to fill even a large -space, is smaller than is eo4as
monay imagined; and, witih distinct articulation, a person  wih a weak
voice will make it reach farther, than the strongest voice can reach without it. To this, therefore, every reader ouglht to pay great attention. He
must give every sound wbich he utters, its due proportion,; aad make eve-y
syllable, and even every- letter in the word which he pronounces be heall
distinctly; witHout slurring, whisperig,:or suppressing any-of thepropr
sounds.
An accurate knowledge of the simple, elementary sounds of the lasguage, and a facility in expressing them, are so necessary to distinctuessof
expression, that if thle learner's attainments are, in this respect, impefect) -,(and many there are in this situation) it will be incumbent on his teache,
to carry him back to these primary articulations; and to suspend his progress, till he become perfectliy master of them. It will be in vainl to prese
him forward, with the hope of forming a good reader, if he eawnot scopletely -articulate every elementary sound of the language.
SECTeION  llt
Due degree of slowness.
Is order to express ourselves distinctly, moderation is requisite with regard
o the speed of pronouncing. - Precipitancy of speech confounds all' ar.
ticulation, and.all meaning. it is-scarely necessary to obsere, that there
may be also an extreme on the opposite side. It is obvious that a lifeless,
drawling manner of reading, which allows tle minds of the hearers to be
always outrunningtie speaker, must renderevery si clh performance issapiS
and fatiguing. But the extreme of reading too fastis much more common,
and requires the more to be guarded against, because, when it has grownx
into a habit, few errors are more difficult to be corrected. To:pronounce
with a proper-degree of slowness, and with full and. clear articultion, is.necessary to be studied byall,who wish to become good readers; and it
cannot be too much recommended to them. Such a proiunciation gives
weigit and dignity to the subject. It is a great assistance to the voice, by
the pauses and rests which it allows the- reader more easily to make; anui
it enables the reader to swell all his sounds, both wit  more force *
more harmony.
SECTION IV.
Propriety of PronRnciatron
AFTER the fundamental attentions to'thse pitch and maniagement of the
voice, to distinct articulation, and to a proper degree of slowness of speech,
what the young reader must, in the next place, study, is propriety of pro.

the beauty of its sparry incrustations.  This celebrated caverinl was first explored by one Magni, an Italian traveller,
about one hundred yeaus ago, at Antiparos, an inconsiderable
island of the Archipelago. " Having been informed," says he,
"by the natives of Paros, that, in the little island of Antiparos,
which lies about two miles fromn the former, a gigantic statue
was to be seen at the mouth of a cavern in that place, it was
resolved that we (the French consul and himself) should pay
it a visit. In pursuance of this resolution, after we had landed
on the island, and walled about four miles through the midst
of beautiful plains, and sloping woodlands, we at length came
to a little hill, on the side of which yawned a most horrid cavern, that, by its gloom, at first struck us-with terror, and almost repressed curiosity.  Recovering the first surprise, bowever, we entered boldly; and had not preceeded above twenty
paces, when the supposed statue of the giant presented itself
to our view. We quickly perceived, that what the ignorant
natives had been terrified at as a giant, was nothing more than
a sparry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the
roof of the cave, and by degrees hardening into a figure,
which their-fears had formed into a monster.  Incited by this
extraordinary appearance, we were induced to proceed still
further, in quest of new adventures in this subterranean abode.
As we proceeded, new wonders offered themselves; the spars,
formed into trees and shrubs, presented a kind of petrified
grove; some white, some green; and all receding in due peripective.  They struck us with the more amazement, as we
knew them to be mere produlctions of nature, who, hitherto
in solitude, had, in her playful moments, dressed the scene,
as if for her own amusement."
"We had as yet seen but a few of the wonders of the
place; and we were introduced only into the portico of this
amazing temple. In one corner of this half illuminated reeess, there appeared an opening of about three feet wide,
which  seerned to lead to a place totally dark, and which one
of the natives assured us contained nothing more than a reservoir of water.  Upon this information, we made an experiment, by throwing down some stones, which rumbling along
the sides of the descent for some time, the sound seemed at
last quashed in a bed of water. In order, however, to be more
certain, we sent in a Levantine mariner, who, by the promise
of a good reward, ventured, with a flambeau in his hand, into
this narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a
quarter of an hour, he returned, bearing in his hand, some
beautiful pieces of white spar, which art could neither-equalChap. 5.             Descrsptzve Pieces.                  89
nor imitate.  Upon being info)rmed by him that the place was
full of these beautiful incrustations, I ventured in once more
with him, about fifty paces, anxiously and cautiously descending, by a steep and dangerous. way.  FiiEng, however, that
we came, to a precipice which led into a spacious amphitheatre, (if I may so call it,).still deeper than any other part,
we returned, and being provided with a ladder, flambeau, and
other things to expedite our descent, our whole company, man
by man, ventured into the same opening; and descenlding one
after another, we at last saw ourselves'all together in the most
magnificient part of the cavern."
SECTION- IV.
The grotto of Aqntiparos, continbued.
"OUR candles being now all lighted up, and the whole
place completely illuminated, never could the eye be presented with a more glittering, or a more magnificent scene.  The
whole roof hung with solid icicles, transparent as glass, yet
solid- as marble. The eye dould scarcely reach the lofty and
noble ceiling;'the sides were regularly formed with spars;
and the whole presented the idea of a magnificent theatre,
illuminated with an immense profusion of lights.  The floor
consisted of solid marble; and, in several places, magnificent
columns, thrones, altars, and other objects, appeared, as if nature had designed to mock the curiosities of art.  Our voices,
upon speaking, or singing, were redoubled to an astonishing
loudness; and upon the firing of a gun, the noise and reverberations were almost deafening.  In the midst of this grand
amphitheatre rose a concretion of about fifteen feet high,
that, in some measure, resembled  an altar; from which,
taking the hint, we caused mass to be celebrated there. The
beautiful columns that shot up ropnd the altar, appeared lilke
candlesticks; and many other natural objects represented the.
customary ornaments of this rite."
"Below even this spacious grotto, there seemed another
cavern  down which I ventured with my former mariner, and
descended about fifty paces by means of a rope.  I at last
arrived at a small spot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different - from  that of the amphitheatre, being composed of soft clay, yielding to the pressure, and.in which I
thrust a stick to the depth&lt; f  six feet.  In this however, as
abovd, numbtrs of the mriost beautifill crystals were formed;
one of which', particularly, resembled a table.  Upon our
egress from this amazing cavern, we perceived a Greek in,9r3       -      ~ JThe Eng, ish Readeer.           Part I

time, that we could not read it distinctly.  It seemed to import that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come
hither; but whether he penetrated into the depths of the
cavern, he does not th;nk fit to inform us."-This account of
so beautiful and striking a scene, may serve to give us some
idea of the subterraneous wonders of nature.    GOLDSMITH.

Earthiquake at Catanea.
ONE of the earthquakes most particularly described in history, is that which happened in the year 1693; the damages
of which were chiefly felt in Sicily, but its motion was perceived in Germany, France, and England.  It extended to a
circumference of two thousand six hundred leagues;,ceiefly
affecting the sea coasts, and great rivers; more pic'eivable
also upon the mountains than in the valleys.  Its motions
were so rapid, that persons who lay at thbirKliength, were
tossed from side to side, as up; aXrolling billow.' The walls
were dashed from their founa     s; and no fewer tiin fiftyfour cities, with an incredible idumber of villages, were either
destroyed or greatly.damaged.  The city of Catanea, in par.
ti:cular, was utterly overthrown.  A'traveller who was on his
way thither, perceived, atthe distance of some miles, a black
cloud, like night, hanging over the place.  The sea, all of a
sudden, began to roar; mount:Etna to send forth gre.at spires
of' flame; and soon after a shock ensued, with a noise as if all
the artillery in the world had been at once discharged.  Our
traveller being obliged to alight instantly, felt himself raised
-a foot from the ground; and turning his eyes to the city,'he'witl amazement saw nothing but a thick cloud of dust in the
atr.  The birds flew about astonished; the sun was darkened;
the beasts ran howling from  the hills; and although the
shock did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thousand of the inhabitants of Sicily perished in the
ruins.:Catanea, to which city the describer was travelling,
s-eemed the principal scene of ruin; its place only was to be
tound; and not a footstep of its former magnificence was to be
seen remaining.                                  GOLDSMITH...  SECTION VI.

word created the world.--What an illustrious moment was that,
when, from non-existence, there sprang at once into being, this
mighty globe, on which so many millions of creatures now
dwell!-No preparatory measures were required.  No long
circuit of means was employed. " He spale; and it was done:
he commanded; andit stood fast. The earth was at first without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep."
The Almighty surveyed the dark abyss; and fixed bounds to
the several divisions of nature. He said, " Let there be light;
and there was light."  Then appeared the sea, and the dry
land. The mountains rose; and the riv~ers flowed.  The sun
and moon began their course in the skies.  I-erbs and plants
clothed the ground. The air, the earth, and the waters, were
stored with their respective inhabitants.  At last, man was
made after the image of God.  He appeared, walking with
countenance erect; and received his Creator's benediction, as
the lord of this new world. The. Almighty beheld his work
when it was finished; and pronounced it GOOD. Superior beings
saw with wonder this new accession to existence. " The
morning stars sang together; and all the sons of God shouted

Charity.
CHARITY is the same with benevolence or love; and is the
term uniformly employed in the New Testament, to denote
all the good affections which we ought to bear-towards one
tanother.  It consists not in speculative ideas of general benevolence, floating.in the head, and leaving the heart, as speculations too often do, untouched and cold.  Neither is it confined
to that indolent good nature, which makes us rest satisfied
with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to ouir fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of service, to any.
True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a single
virtue; but a disposition residing in the heart, as a fountig
whence all the virtues of benignity, candodur, forbearance, g e-~
nerosity, compassion, and liberality, flow  asr o many native
streams.  From  general good-will to all, it extends its infla
ence particularly to those with whom we sttand in nearest &lt;on--
oenxion, and who are directly within the esphere of "ur goo0

relations, and friends; and spreads itself over the whole circle of social and domestic life. I mean not that it imports a
promiscuous undistinguished affection, which gives every man
an equal title to our love.  Charity, if we should endeavour
to carry it so far, would be rendered an impracticable virtue;
and would resolve itself into mere words, without affecting the
heart.  True charity attempts not to shut our eyes to the distinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts
equally to those who befriend, and those who injure us.  It
reserves our esteem for good men, and our complacency for our
friends. Towards our enemies it inspires forgiveress, humanity,
and a solicitude for their welfare. It breathes universal candour, and liberality of sentiment. It forms gentleness of
temper, and dictates affability of manners. It prompts corresponding sympathies with them  who rejoice, and them  who
weep. It teaches us to slight and despise no man. Charity is.the comforter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppressed,
the reconciler of differences, the intercessor for offenders. It
is faithfulness in the friend, public spirit in the magistrate,.equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the sovereign,
and loyalty in the subject. In parents, it is care and attention;
in children, it is reverence and submission. In a word, it is the
soul of social life. It is the sun that enlivens and cheers the
abodes of men. It is " like the dew of Hermon," says the
Psalmist, 1" and the dew that descended on the mountains of
Zion, where the Lord commanded the blessing, ev4n life for
evermore."                                            BLAIR.

Prosperity is redoubled to a gaod man.
NONE but the'temporate, the regular, and the virtuous,
know how to enjoy prosperity. They bring to its comforts the
manly relish of a sound uncorrupted mind. They stop at the
proper point, before enjoyment degenerates into disgust, and
pleasure is converted into pain.  They are strangers to those
complaints which flow fro m  spleen, caprice, and all the
fantastical distresses of a vitiated mind..While riotous indulgence enervates both the body and the mind, purity and virtue
heighten all the powers of human fruition.
Feeble are all pleasures in which the heeart has no share

ready to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's
heart to sing with joy.  I was Fyes to the blind, and feet was
I to the lame: I was a father to the poor; and the cause
which I knew not I searched out."-Thus, while the righteous
man flourishes like a tree planted by the rivers of water, he
brings forth also his fruit in its season: and that fruit he brings
forth, not for himself alonie.  He flourishes, not like a tree in
some solitary desert, which scatters its blossoms to the wind,
and communicatesDneither fruit nor shade to any living thing:
but like a tree in the midst of an inhabited country, which to
somne affords friendly shelter, to others fruit; which is not only
admired by all for its beauty;, but blessed by the traveller for
the shade, and by the hungry for the sustenance, it hath given.

On the beauties of the Psalms.
GREATNESS confers no exemption from the cares and sorrows of life: its share of them frequently bears a melancholy
proportion to its exaltation.  This the monarch of lsriael experienced.  lie sought in piety, that peace which he could
not find in empire; and alleviated the disquietudes of state,
with the exercises of devotion. His invaluable Psalms convey
those comforts to others, which they afforded to himself. Composed upon particular occasions, yet designed for general
use: delivered out as services for Israelites under the Law,
vet no less adapted to the circumstances of Christians under
the Gospel; they presen:t religion to us in the most engaging
dress; cofnmunicati.g truths which philosophy could never
Investigate, in a style which poetry can never equal; while
history is made the vehicle of prophecy, and creation lends all
its charms to paint the glories offredemption.  Calculated
alike to profit and to please, they inforim the understanding,
elevate the affections, and entertain the imagination.  Indited
under the influence of HiM, to whom  all hearts are known,
and all events foreknown, they suit mankind in all situations;
grateful as the manna which descended from above, and conformned itself to every n~l4ate.~94                  The English Reader.           Part I

SECTION XII.
-The, s.avery of vice.
THE slavyry    produced by vice appears r the dependence
tinder iihich it brings, the sinner, to circumstances of-externalfortune. One of the favourite characters of liberty, is the
independence it bestows. He who is truly a freeman is
above all servile compliances, and abject subjection. He is
able to rest upon himself; and while he regards his superiors
with proper deference, neither debases himself by cringing to
them, nor is tempted to purchase their favour by dishonourable means.  But the sinner has forfeited every privilege of
this nature. His passions and habits render him an absolute
dependant on the world, and the world's favour; on the uncertain goods of fortune, and the fickle humours of men.
For it is by these he, subsists, and among these his happiness
is sought; according as his passions determine him to pursue
pleasures, riches, or preferments.  Having no fund within
himself whence to draw enjoyment, his only resoiprce is in
things without.  His hopes and fears all hang upon the world.
He partakes in all its vicissitudes; and is moved and shaken
by every wind of fortune. This is to be, in the strictest sense,
a slavecto the world.
Religion and'virtue, on the other hand, confer on the mind
principles of noble independence.," The upright man is
satisfied from  himself."  He despises not the advantages of
fortune, but he centres not his happiness in them.  With a
moderate share of them  he can be contented; and contentment is felicity. IHappy in his own integrity, conscious of the
esteem  of good men, reposing firm trust in'the providence,
and the promises of God, he is exempted from servile dependence on other things.  He can wrap himself up in a good
conscience, and look forward, without terror, to the change
of the world. Let all things shift around- him as they please,
he believes that, by the Divine ordination, they shall be made
to work together in the issue for his good: and therefore,
having much to hope from  God, and little to fear from the
world, he can be easy in every state. One who possesses within himself such an establishment of mind, is truly free.  But
shall I call that man free, who has nothing that is his own, no
property assured; whose very heart is not his own, but rendered the appendage of external things, and the sport of fortune? Is that man free, let his outward condition be ever so
splendid, whom his imperious passions dtraln at their call,
whom they send forth at their pleasure, to drudge and toil,
and to beg his only enjoyment from  the casualties of the
world? Is he free, who must flatter and lie to compass -his
ends; who must bear with this man's caprice, and that man's
scorn; must profess friendship where he hates, and respe
