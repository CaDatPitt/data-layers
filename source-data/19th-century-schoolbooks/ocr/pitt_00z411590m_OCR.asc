LESSON 2
PHYSICAL TRAINING IN PENMANSHIP PRACTICE
Correct Posture, Relaxing Exercises, Movement Practice, and Penholding, Taught in Pictures
O progress can be made in mastering good muscular movement writing
until there is a correct understanding of the important steps and
the order in which they must be taken.
No written or spoken words can explain these more fully and plainly
than the fifteen accompanying pictures given as models. They tell all
that could be told about the important beginning steps, and they should
be studied with thoroughness now, and often during future practice periods.
Step one, illustration four: Position in seat with arms hanging limply
at the sides. Step two, number five: Body turned a little to the left
and arms extended above the desk, wrists and fingers limp. Step-three,
number six: After permitting both arms to drop to the desk, raise right
arm as shown in the picture, withdraw control and let it drop, repeating
the operation until the arm drops comfortably into the writing position,
with a square turn at the elbow and fingers bent naturally. Step four,
number seven: Learn to run the writing machine.
Notice the closed fingers making a fist, and the absorbed interest with
which this boy studies his arm near the elbow. The arm is the machine,
and the engine that moves it is above the elbow. With the arm lying on
the desk in that position, it requires but little effort to drive the wrist
forward out of, and to pull it backward into, the sleeve; this is "muscular
movement." Fix in your mind the following facts: In muscular movement
writing the arm is never raised above, but lies on the desk all the time in
a perfectly natural, comfortable position; the sleeve remains in one place
on the desk at all times, and the flesh on the arm moves. the action being
inside the sleeve.
Careful study of illustrations nine and ten at this point will be helpful.
The arrow points to the main rest, which should always be the larger part
of the forearm near the elbow. In writing, the wrist and side of the hand
should never touch the paper. There are only two rests, the rhusdle near
the elbow, as explained, and the third and fourth fingers, those fingers supplying a movable rest, and gliding overthe paper in the various directions
in which the pen moves.
Do not think of writing or penholding at this point, but give all your
attention to position, muscular relaxation, and the running of the writing
machine, until good position and easy movement have become natural.
It often pays primary grade pupils to practice on position, relaxing exercises,
and movement, from three to six weeks before taking writing instruments,
It is best that all beginners on muscular movement practice should
devote several periods to these things before thinking of penholding or
writing.
Future progress depends upon present understanding of these first
important steps. Even after beginning the movement drills, and when
muscular movement is used in all writing, parts of practice periods should
be devoted to the study of the writing machine, and to the calisthenic
exercises suggested.
Illustration number eight is worthy of close study and imitation. This
boy was looking at some object at a distance. In this position you should
practice the movement. Test the movement here, and see if you can feel
the acti6n of the muscle of the forearm as it rests on the desk.12

also look at the portionm of the penholder in sight.
In number fifteen, notice carefully the distance between the boy and
the dlesk. You shotul( always sit well back in your seat, SO far back that
the body will not touch the (lesk. This boy is none too far back; his
writing is well in front of the eyes, andI it is easy for him to retain the
very important sqluare turn at the right elbow. YouL shoult follow his good
example in the matter of position, and if you practice faithfully you can
soon become an expert p)enman.
Numnber sixteen shows the position in which many good business penmen carry the I)enholder when writing. Others who write just as well
let the holder (irop below the knuckle joint, as shown in illustrations
twenty-four and( twenty-five, page seventeen. The best position is
determined by the length of the fingers and the shape of the hand. It is
not necessary that the pupil with a long, slim hand and long, tapering:
fingers, shoul carry his penholler in exactly the same position as the
pupil with the short, thick hand and short, stubby fingers.
N page fourteen are five pictures of a boy who sits in a splendid
O position for writing. IHe is never found in a cramped or poor position. In number eleven, the right elbow is placed on the lower
right corner, the hand pointed toward the upper left corner, of the clesk.
The arm may then be lowered until it rests in a writing position.  In
number twelve, the left arm is placed on the desk as shown in pictures
one, two, and three, and then the exercise of the muscles begins. The
entire right arm is on the desk, and this is the best position, except when
the arm is so thin that the bone of the elbow grates on the desk. Then
the elbow may be extended off the desk enough to relieve the discomfort.
In no case will it be necessary to extend the elbow more than an inch;
and not one pupil in a hundred will need to take advantage of this exception
to the rule, that the entire right arm should be on the desk.
In number thirteen, make a special study of the upper part of the penholder. It does not point toward the right shoulder, and never will, if
the arm, wrist, and hand are allowed to retain natural positions, providing
pupil and desk are fitted to each other. In number fourteen, again study14

TIME REQUIRED TO LEARN
The process of learning a good style of muscular movement
writing may be made easy or difficult, short or long, possible
or impossible, according to the mental attitudes of teacher
and pupil, and the exactness with which directions in this
Manual are followed.
Pupils who constantly practice the movement drills in
poor positions with incorrect movement never even get
started, and pupils who practice from fifteen to thirty
minutes a day in good positions with correct movement, but
who fall back into the old bad cramped positions and finger
movement habits in all other writing, do not get beyond the
beginning stages, no matter how many years they may practice.
The pupil who becomes the absolute master of a finished
style of muscular movement writing within the limits of six
months or one school year is he who gives the closest attention
to every detail relating to the beginning steps, who follows
the printed instructions closely, who sits in correct position
at all times, and uses muscular movement,throughout the
writing lessons, and in all his written work within a month
from the time he begins to study the Palmer Method.
Without conflicting with other subjects it is possible to lay
the foundation for an excellent handwriting ian one school year,
with. but fifteen to thirty minutes daily study and practice,
and the employment of muscular movement in all written
work just as soon as possible. As progress is made in the grades
the use of muscular movement can be permanently established.
The boy becomes an expert ball-player by playing ball.
At first he is awkward and uncertain, but, as he studies the
methods of those who have become experts, and continues to
practice, he takes on self-confidence, and finally develops into
an expert, even though he could not hit a single ball during
his first few games. Boys and girls who learn to skate with
almost consummate grace must pass through the awkward
stages, when they sit down instead of standing up as they
had planned, and when their feet take possession and run
away with them. In instrumental music of any kind one
does not become an expert without first learning how to
practice and then practicing in exactly the right way according
to methods prescribed by master teachers. It is the same in
penmanship: first, learn how to practice and then practice
faithfully. Acquire elasticity, lightness, and freedom, and
do not mind if the pen runs away at first and makes some
awkward letters. This is to be expected. But stick to the
right plan, and gradually you will gain control of the writing
muscles of the arm, and with close attention to general form,
size, slant, spacing, and correct movement application, you
will become a splendid muscular movement penman in a few
short months.HAND, FINGER, AND PENHOLDER

HESE diagrams are intended to show clearly the position of the
writing paper on the desk, the relative positions of arms, paper and
desk, and the direction in which the pen moves to secure uniform
slant. Number twenty-six is the half-side position mostly used in public
schools and best adapted to them, because of the character of the desks.
Number twenty-seven is the square front position.
In both diagrams, A represents the square turn at the right elbow
and its position on the desk, B is the muscular rest of the forearm, C
the position of the left hand in its relation to the paper and the right
hand, D the penholder, and E E the imaginary line between the eyes
along which the pen should travel in upward and downward strokes.
With the right forearm crossing the lower edge of the paper a little
to the right of the center, the pen should progress one-fourth or onethird of the distance across a sheet of paper eight inches wide, before the
position of the paper is changed. Always use the left hand to move the
paper. Paper 8xlO,1/2 inches in width should be moved three or four times
in the progress of the pen across it. When the end of the line has been
reached, the paper should be returned to its original position, and should
be moved up on the desk the width of one line. Lift the pen before
moving the paper.It is not Palmer Method if the lines are tremulous. Study instructions for speed requirements
LESSON 4
Now the serious work of using and applying the correct movement  muscular relaxation, and penholding. Don't practice before you know
begins. Before attempting to make any part of drill one, review lessons  how. With the left hand, move the paper to the left three times at equal
one, two, and three, and give the closest possible attention to position,  intervals, in the progress of the pen across it.
Drill 1
Letting the distance between the two ruled lines, three-eighths of an inch
apart, represent one space in height, any part of this drill should be two
spaces high. Look at these drills until you have a good mental picture
of the height, proportions, and general appearance.
In connection with the straight line part of the drill, study closely
diagrams twenty-six and twenty-seven on page eighteen. There is no
value in this straight line exercise unless practiced with a forward and
backward motion, from and toward the center of the body, with the paper
held in the correct position.
If you cannot make the several parts of drill one high enough at first
with pure muscular movement, practice without touching the pen to the
paper until you have developed more muscular freedom.
In the second line of drill one, the traced oval should first contain six,
and later, as a lighter movement is developed, ten revolutions. In this drill
it will be well to make first the straight line on the correct slant, and then the
oval enclosing it. This order may be changed frequently and the ovals made
first. This is an important drill as it has a very specific bearing upon slant.
To the Teacher: It may be profitable for third, fourth, and fifth year
pupils to spend the practice periods of one week in studying and practicing-.
the two movement drills given in this lesson, reviewing each day everything that has gone before. Pupils in the sixth, seventh, and eighth
years, and in high schools classes should be able to progress more rapidly.
It is not safe to say how rapidly, as that depends upon the knowledge of
the teacher, the mental caliber of the pupils, their interest in the work,
the length of the daily lessons, and the amount of the right kind of outside
practicing that pupils do.2.

COUNTING TO REGULATE MOTION
In developing light, uniform motion in class penmanship practice,
counting is important. It makes the work more interesting, tones down
the movement of the naturally nervous pupil, acts as a constant spur to the
habitually slow boy or girl, and keeps the indolent stuLdent busy. In the
obliqlue straight line and the oval exercises given in drill one, the downwar(l strokes only shouldcl be counted(l. The other parts of the drills, being
what are terimed connective lines, are not counted.
ABOUT SPEED
Speed is so important in the development of good writing that it should
receive close attention in all practice work until correct speed has become
a habit. Too much speed is julst as bad as too little. Correct speed forces
a light, firm line; too little speed results in shaky tremulous lines; while
excessive speed means irregular letter formation. If you develop a light,
firm, elastic motion, and the proper degree of speed in straight line and
oval making, you will find the work of the following lessons comparatively
easy.
The straight line and oval exercises in drills one, two, and three
should be made at a speed of two hundred downward strokes to a
minute; one hundred in one-half a minute; and then move the
paper.
The most convenient count for continuous straight line or oval
exercises as given in (Irill two is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,, 8, 9, 20-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 40-1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 50, continuing until two hundred has been reached. Until
correct speed habits have been developed, the second hand of a watch
should be utised as a gulide.
A few minutes in the right way are worth more than hours of
practice in the wrong way.21

ABOUT SLANT
Slant needs no special study, but will take care of itself if the instructions have been studied and heeded. Especially is this true in
relation to the position at the desk, the position of the paper and arms
on the desk, the relation of each to the other, and the changing of the
paper with the left hand, to keep it in the right position in regard to the
desk, body, and arms. See diagrams-page eighteen.
If the position is correct, and if all downward strokes are made
toward the cenrtr of the body, each pupil will develop uniform slant,

When two lines are connected in an angle, a positive stop at the
point of connection is necessary. This principle applies to the top of
capital A where the upward and the last downward strokes are joined.
This stop is such a small fraction of a second in duration that it can
hardly be detected. Without the stop at the top of capital A, a loop will
be made. To emphasize this stop in connection with capital A, the following conversational count has been developed. "You stop, you stop,
at the top, you stop, every time, at the top. How long do you stop at
the top? Not long, but you stop, every time, at the top. What for, what
for, what for? Oh! To close them up, to close them up, to close them
up,"' and repeat. Other conversational counts that may be used with
capital A are, "Roll the arm, on the muscle; see it roll, on the muscle;
slide the hand, on the fingers, see them slide, over the paper, make them
glide." Make your letters the same size as in the drill, and begin each
letter as the pen moves downward. Make capital A in groups of five,
and move the paper a little to the left after each of the first two groups
as indicated by the check mark. When the third group of five has been
finished, move the paper to the right to its correct position for beginning
a line. Learning to move the paper in this and in other drills is very important. There are three groups of five, making fifteen letters to a line in
drill six, and five lines, seventy-five letters, should be made in a minute.
The dotted line between the first and second letters shows the path
over which the pen should move without touching the paper, in passing
from one letter to the next. A count of ten should be used in each group
of five, and the count for each line should be 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, mnove

ovals, and capital A, at a speed that will produce at least sixty-five and
very soon seventy-five in a minute. For the present, three minutes could
very profitably be spent in repeating the capital A with an easy, swinging,
rhythmic motion. Select your best capital and compare it with the models
giving close attention to size, slant, width, distance between letters, and
the beginning and finishing lines.26

Hereafter, each lesson should begin with practice of the compact
two-space oval, drill three, drill six, and drill eleven, and there should
be frequent reviews of the other drills so far practiced.
In the large oval drill and its modifications in capitals A, O, and C,
the motion has been mainly forward and backward, while that used in
the connected small o drill is mainly toward the right, developing the
lateral movement. If too much driving force from above the elbow is
used, the letter will be too large. If the position is just right, the least
possible force will drive the hand far enough to form the o. The line
connecting the letters should be as nearly straight as is possible to make
it at the required speed. If too pronounced an under-curve is used in
the connective lines the result will be a form more nearly resembling
small a than o.
In this style of writing, small o and letters in its class should be
one-sixteenth of an inch high. The letter in this drill is of that height,
*it should be used as a basis of comparison in determining the height
of the other minimum letters a, c, e, i, m, n, r, s, u, v, w, and x. Small
r and s may be made one-fourth higher than the other letters in the minimum class.
Wherever there is an angular connection as in closing small o at the
top, there must be a checking of the motion at that point; in fact, a stop.
The closing of o is so quickly done that the stop can hardly be seen even
by the closest observer.
To the Teacher: In connection with this drill we urge teachers
to use a conversational count. In passing from desk to desk, criticise the
work in correct rhythm. Suppose one student is making o too-arge,
another not closing it at the top, another usit a slow, dragging movement, another making a narrow, flat letter, and still another bending
over his desk too far. The criticisms would be as follows: "Make it
smaller, make it smaller; close it up, close it up; your stop, at the
top, you stop, you stop, every time, at the top.  How long?  Not
long; but you stop, every time, at the top. Slide along, slide along;
round o, round o; sit up, sit up." Each criticism or admonition may
be repeated until the error has in a measure been corrected.  The
influence will not be lost upon the rest of the pupils, but those who have
been making the same errors will almost unconsciously show marked
improvement.
A speed of ninety or more to a minute should be developed and maintained. Ninety in a minute is by no means fast, but, while permitting
good form, it is fast enough to force light motion.
In drill eleven, there are three groups of five letters in a line, and
there are six lines in the drill, making ninety letters. These should be
made in a minute, and that should be the practice speed. As in capital
A, the plan is to make each group to a count of ten, and then move the
paper. For an entire line the count would be 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10,
move the paper, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, move the paper, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6,
7-8, 9-10, move the paper. The conversational count may be fitted nicely
to the rhythm of the count of ten. Hereafter, drill eleven should be practiced with the two-space compact oval, and drill six at the beginning of
each practice period.

SOME PALMER METHOD FACTS-A PERSONAL TALK
Read and Carefully Consider Everything on These Three Pages Before Beginning the
Study and Practice of the Lessons. Failing to follow These Simple Suggestions,
You are Likely to Waste Many Hours, Weeks, and Months in Useless Practice
HE PALNI9     METHOD is a text-book on practical
writing and should be studied as such-not treated as
a copy-book. -The printed instructions are the author's
direct personal Aks to pupils-the same things he would
say to you from  Sy to day were he personally to teach you.
These instructions are of more importance than the copies.
They tell you how to develop and use the muscular movement
in writing. If you do not follow the instructions, you will fail.
Pupils who followed absolutely the Palmer Method plan
have always learned to write well. Pupils who have not first
studied the plainly printed directions and followed them absolutely, have partly or completely failed. Failure is unnecessary.
Thousands of young men and women have made the
Palmer Method of Business Writing the stepping-stone to
positions in business offices, where commercial advancement
rewarded faithful service.  
In hundreds of classes where the Palmer Method has
been faithfully studied and completely mastered, periods
devoted to written spelling, composition, examinations, and
other written work have been reduced more than half. Time
thus saved has been put to very good use in other directions.
In the beginning stages of the work, until good position,
muscular relaxation, correct and comfortable penholding,
and muscular movement as a habit in writing have been
acquired, extra practice may be necessary; but the extra
time will be saved many times over in all written work later.
*        lscular movement writing means good, healthful pos_   aight spinal columns, eyes far enough away from the
/r safety, and both shoulders of equal height. These
ees alone should be sufficient to encourage boys and girls
to master a physical training system of writing such as is presented in the following pages, remembering that it is impossible to do good muscular movement writing in twisted,
unhealthful positions, or with stiff and rigid muscles.
Straight line and oval drills are of no value except as they
lead to writing. They are the means through which to gain
the muscular control that will enable pupils to master an
ideal permanent style of rapid, plain-as-print writing.
When pupils have learned good posture, correct penholding, and how to use muscular movement in making a good
two-space compact oval, they are ready to begin to learn how
to write well. Too many pupils think they have really
learned how to write well when they are able to make some
of the very simple drills in correct posture at the right speed
and in correct rhythm. That is really the starting-point
toward good penmanship, and should be followed immediately by the practice of words, and, indeed, by the use of the
movement in all written work.N

LESSON 17
From this point each lesson should start with the compact two-space oval; drill eleven, small o; and drill fourteen, small m. It will pay to
devote from three to five minutes of each practice period to these three drills.
Drill 15
For small m, a count of three is used; and in n, a count of two. Thus, the count for drill fifteen will be 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, etc., or for five connected letters, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10. The speed should be the same relatively as in the small m drill.

Perhips you have forgotten something; perhaps you were about to begin your practice of drill twenty-eight without the review of the compact

Drill 28
In penmanship, constant repetition is essential, and in connection
with drill twenty-eight the best results will be secured by practicing the
word several minutes. We prefer to have pupils at first use the style
of capital given in the first line, in which the finishing stroke is carried
below the base, and the pen lifted from the paper before the small letters
are made. Later the final stroke in capital M may be connected directly
with any small le}ters following, as in the second line. You are expected
to write six words on a line, as in the copy, writing from fourteen to
seventeen a minute.
To the Teacher: If you have studied the lessons in advance, have
practiced the different drills and mastered them before giving them to
your pupils, a good plan to follow in word-practice is sometimes to sit
at your desk, or a pupil's desk writing the words with them and spelling
as you write. Thus: M-o-o-n, M-o-o-n. This will enable you to help
your boys and girls to master the correct speed, and to secure uniform
motion.
Never attempt to use the count for individual letters when practicing
words; it is confusing.38

Small a is, in the main, a reduced copy of capital A, and the first parts
of small d, g, and q are identical with it. Fix the resemblance in the
mind; it will help you. In business writing it is best to make the looped

Study and practice go hand in hand in securing the best
results in the shortest possible time. Keep the Manual open
before you as you practice; study and make frequent and
careful comparisons of your work with the drills if you wish
to make rapid progress.
Your letters, words, and sentences should occupy the same
amount of space they do in the Manual. Always, before
beginning practice, the drill should be studied in every little
detail until the correct picture is in your mind.
Just how and where does the first line in a letter bw

the letter; how wide is each part; how much runni
does it occupy; in what direction should the pen mn
beginning, continuing, and completing the letter; and at
what rate of speed should the letter or word be written?
These are questions that should constantly occupy you as
soon as automatic muscular movement has been established.
In fact, as was said before, study and practice must go hand
in hand, if good results are to be the outcome.
Blackboard copies, though written by expert penmen, are
seen at many different angles, and at different distances, and
do not give correct mental impressions.
It is highly important not only that pupils have copies 6f
the Manual, but that they study the printedinstructions and
drills, closely and constantly.
The plainly printed instructions in the Palmer Method
tell you step by step exactly what to do and how to do it,
in order to progress steadily and surely toward the desired end.
Millions of American boys and girls have learned a
ermanent style of rapid, easy, legible, and beautiful writing
by carefully and patiently following the printed directions
found in the Palmer Method of Business Writing. Final
results have then been delightful to pupils, teachers, parents,
and school officials.
The first step is a correct understanding of the required
position. Study the pictures on pages twelve, fourteen, and
fifteen, of a pupil who has learned how to sit so as to use thelarge tireless muscles of his arms to the it possible advantage. Study every little detail of these-ictures from the
crown of the head to the shoes. Study particularly and
closely the arms, the relation of one arm to the other, the
position at the desk, the distance of the jy from the desk,
and the positions of the fingers preparatory to taking the
penholder.
As progress is made in the more advanced lessons, you
should refer frequently to these pictures and try to sit as
this pupil sat when his photographs were taken for the
Palmer Method. When writing, he always sits as shown in
these photographs, and he knows that it would be physically
impossible to use muscular movement writing in a cramped,
unhealthful position.
There is an old saying, "Practice makes perfect." That
is only partly true in relation to writing. Practice of the
right kind leads toward perfection, but the wrong kind of
practice leads just as surely in the opposite direction. It is
not so much the exercise that is practiced as the manner in
which it is practiced. Millions of pupils have wasted the
time given to movement exercises because they thought it
was the exercise that counted and not the.manner in which
it was made.
There is no value in any penmanship drill ever invented
unless it is practiced with correct positions of body, arms,40

LESSON 32
The basis of the extended loop letters, b, f, h, and k, is small 1.
These five letters should extend the same distance above the base line.
The practice of small 1 should be thorough now, and it should be
reviewed often. In fact, it would be well to add it to the group of
compact ovals, and small m's and o's, to be practiced at the beginning
of each lesson.
Height-Reference has already been made to one-sixteenth of an
inch as representing a space in height for the minimum (one-space)
letters a, c, e, i, m, n, o, u, v, w, and x. The small r and s are in the same
class, but are made a quarter space higher than the others.
These minimum letters should always be used as a standard of onespace measurement to regulate the height of all other small letters. On
that basis small 1 should be four spaces-four-sixteenths, or one-fourth
of an inch high. As there are six-sixteenths of an inch between the ruled
lines in the practice paper generally used, and in all the Palmer Method
practice paper, there should be two-sixteenths (one-eighthi of an inch
between the top of the loop and the ruled line above.
It should be remembered that a space in height is the height of the
minimum letters in the style you are practicing. As an example, in copybooks used in former years, the one-space letters were one-eighth of an
inch, or twice as high as in these lessons. The loop letters were three
spaces, or three-eighths of an inch high, which is two-sixteenths of an inch
higher than the loops in these lessons.
Movement Used-In business writing, all loops below the line
should be made with pure muscular movement. In making those above
the line, the fingers should be relaxed, and as the arm slides forward, a
slight extension of the fingers will help to make the upper part of the loop.
The combination of the two movements is perfectly natural to most hands,
and little encouragement need be given to the use of the fingers. The
student must guard against using much of it. Keep an eye on your wrist
to see that it moves forward and backward in unison with the other movements. Under no circumstances allow the fleshy part of the hand in
front of the wrist to touch the paper.
Cautions-You will find your first difficulty in getting enough' curve
on the upward stroke. A half hour's determined practice will do much
to overcome this. Keep the paper at such an anle as will make the
downward strokes straight toward the middle of the body. Above all,
preserve unity in height, in slant and in spacing. Do not shade.41
Drill 33
There is a slight check in the motion on the downward strokes, but no pause at the base line. After a little practice, loops as good as the
above should be made at the rate of from one hundred to one hundred and twenty to the minute. The count in groups of five is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-one for
each letter.
LESSON 33
Drill 34
~&lt; C
More study, more practice. Study and practice should be constant
companions in developing good writing. One withotut the other will
lead to one-sided results. Don't be one-sided.
Drill thirty-four offers good movement practice. Close observation
will indicate just how it is done. The small traced oval is about onehalf the capital in height, and the upper loop is also one-half the entire
height of the letter. If you have a sharp eye and a responsive mind,
you have been able to grasp these details without any suggestions, and
you have gone further. You have noted the curve in the main downward
stroke, the flatness of the lower loop on the base line, and the dropping
of the finishing stroke below the base.
Six is the count for the traced oval and two for L, as follows,
1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2. The count of 1-2, for the capital L should be a little
slower than for the ovals. This exercise should be made ten times
on a line, in groups of five, and two lines, or twenty exercises a
minute.
A few minutes in the right way are worth hours of practice in the wrong way.

Make the oval to a count of six, lift the pen from the paper at
the top, and without checking the motion swing the pen in its natural
course above the paper, to the right and below the base to the point
of contact with the paper in starting the letter. Do not stop the
motion, but strike the paper in an upward course at full speed for
the beginning stroke of J. If the explanation of applied motion is not
fully understood, study until it is, and then fill at least a half page with
the copy.
Do not neglect the form, but note carefully the following points:
J should begin with an upward stroke from a point just below the base
line; the turn at the top should be round; the upper part should be a little
longer than the lower part, and twice its width.
LESSON 50-Drill 55
If slant is troublesome, study and practice this drill faithfully. Count 1-2 for capital J and make sixty to seventy letters to a minute.
Drill 56
This copy is given as a drill on both movement and form. From the beginning stroke of J to the finishing of small s the pen should not
be lifted. Write the word from beginning to end with a steady, light and unlform movement.  Eighteen or twenty words to the minute will
be a fair rate of speed for practice.fingers, penholders, paper, and with exactly the right movement, and at exactly the right rate of speed.
If you study the instructions in the Palmer Method, and
follow them absolutely in daily practice, you will make steady
progress and, within a short time, become a splendid penman. But, even should you spend a great deal of time practicing the drills in a poor position with cramped muscles and
with the wrong movement, you not' only will make no progress
toward good writing, but will contract bad habits, or firmly
fix those already established, and, under such conditions, the
possibility of learning to write well will constantly become
more and more remote.
It is a fact, that among the thousands of men and women
employed in business offices who do longhand writing constantly, rapidly, and well, none can be found who do not use
muscular movement, because it is the only movement through
which penmanship embracing in the highest degree legibility,
rapidity, ease, and endurance can be developed.
It is now generally conceded that systems of copy-books
have inevitably resulted in a poor finished product of penmanship. Public school officials and teachers were satisfied
with copy-books so long as they did not consider good posture,
muscular relaxation, easy, tireless movement and reasonable
speed, as important factors. Then the discovery was made
that pupils were able to draw the letters slowly and very
accurately in close imitation of mechanically engraved copies,
but that when rapid, continuous writing was required in the
penmanship employed in written spelling, compositions,
examinations, etc., the letter forms became dissipated in
appearance and soon approached the stage of scribbling.
It must be conceded by everyone that any system of
writing which does not lead to an automatic style embodying
legibility, rapidity, ease, and endurance is a failure.
The term "Copy-book" has been applied for many years
to sheets of paper bound together with a cover, containing at
the top of each page, a line of writing or an exercise to be
imitated by the pupils on the lines below. Sometimes the
headlines are made from carefully penciled copies, mechanically
perfected through a system of hand engraving.'There are also bound books, with copies at the top of the
pages that were really written with some show of muscular
movement and afterward photo-engraved, but the copy-book
principles are involved in the publication of such booksprinciples which preclude the teaching of good writing through
their use. The mental attitude of pupils who see before
them the immaculate page upon which they must make
reproductions, as nearly facsimile as possible of the copies at
the top, is wholly unfavorable to the process.
Another recent copy-book system is the pad with the copy
at the top, and sometimes at the top and center of each page,
there being blank lines below for practice purposes. -These
modified copy-books are probably doing just as much harm to
the cause of practical writing as the former kind. Unless the
mental attitude is right, physical conditions will be wrong.

Drill 60MOVEMENT DRILL DESIGN
T is often a good plan to encourage students to give full play to
their inventive and constructive ability in adapting the drills to
different designs. Such work, however, should be done largely
out of school hours. A great variety of such designs from schools
where the Palmer Method is in use may be seen on the walls of the
author's offices. In the drills mentioned are mainly used the straight
line; compact, open and interlaced ovals, large and small; small m,
n, e, o, c, 1, h, and b. Among these designs are houses, carriages,
crosses, battleships, and many curious designs for which we do not
find names. Many arc worked out iln colored inks and the effect,
on the whole, is pleasing.
Herewith we give a drill that is a favorite exercise with many
teachers. Let the student use pencil outlines to indicate length of
lines and width of ovals.

LESSON 54-Drill 61
This copy furnishes all the movement drill necessary in beginning this lesson.  Count ten for each drill, two for capital S, and eight for
the reverse traced oval. About sixteen complete drills should be made to the minute. This drill is especially recommended to those who find
the development of a light, quick movement difficult.
Drill 62
Study the curve of the first stroke; study the loop at the top, and give especial attention to the fact that the loop (upper part of S) is onehalf the entire length of the letter. With an easy, light movement make from forty-five to fifty letters to the minute. Count 1, 2, for each letter.
Drill 63
The angular finishing stroke shown in drill sixty-three is very popular with many excellent teachers of business writing. Almost the same
number of letters should be made in a minute as in drill sixty-two. Its practical feature is the direction taken by the finishing stroke, which
may be joined to any letter following. Count 1, 2, swing; or 1, 2, 3, for each letter.
LESSON 55-Drill 64

In this drill, capital G is made first to a coutnt of three, and then, without lifting the pen, followed with six revolutions of the reverse traced oval.
Make seventeen completed exercises in a nlute. Count as follows: 1, 2-3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Drill 66
Study the form of capital G closely before attempting to make it; be sure that you not only know when you make a poor letter, but that
you know why it is poor. One bad stroke may spoil an otherwise good letter. Learn to locate the bad strokes. Make from forty to fifty letters
to the minute. Count 1, 2, 3; or 1, stop, 3, for each letter.
Drill 67
this is a good business form. Special instruction is unnecessary. Use your eyes. Make as many as fifty in a minute.
Drill 68
The angular finishing stroke gives a connective line for anv letter that may follow, and admits of joining the capitals for an extended drill
as well. Count 1, 2, for each letter, or 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, for each group of three. Make eighteen groups in a minute.
You aim before you shoot. You should study the instructions before you practice the drills.55
LESSON 57-Drill 69
Nothing can be better at this stage of the work than easv words constantly repeated. Through a series of repetitions, strength in movement is developed, and faults are seen. Twelve or fourteen words to a minute should be the practice speed.

HOW TO
In making figure one, draw the hand toward you with a quick light
motion, sliding on the third and fourth fingers. Uniformity in the height
and slant are the two important points to observe.
The development and application of a lateral oval motion will aid in
the construction of figure two. In making it in class drill a count of
three should be used, thus-one, two, three, one, two, three, etc., or dot,
two, three.
Notice the exercise preceding figure three in lesson sixty-five. The
motion used in that exercise will produce a good figure if properly applied.
&amp;7/sfo
/ R
PRACTICE
One, two, three, or dot, two, three, is the count used. A count of three
is used in figures four and five also, but for figures six, seven, and nine,
use a count of two.
Several lessons should be given to drilling on the figures singly before
grouping them, but as soon as the forms are mastered and the student
can make them at a fair rate of speed, it is best to drill in miscellaneous
order somewhat as follows: 1, 0, 2, 6, 9, 8, 5, 4, 3, 0, 9, 6, 7, 2, 2, 8, 9, 3,
5, 6, 9, 1, 5, 8, 6, 9, 5, 4, 6, 9, 3, 7, 8, etc. No particular order is necessary,
but the aim should be to repeat one as often as another.

CORRECT POSITIONS FOR CLASS ROOM WRITING
IN the following pages are reproduced photographs of a class of students
who are experts in the Palmer Method writing. While they knew
that-their photographs were to be taken, they did not change their
every-day penmanship positions in the least particular. It was not
necessary, because they had all acquired the habit of sitting in positions
that are comfortable and which at the same time permit muscular freedom
and control.
In elementary schools in cities, space is so limited that the use of
tables or desks large enough to permit the square front position for
writing is usually impossible. If the desks are too small for the square
front position the half-right side positiqn may be used.
Study these pictures closely; it will pay.
In the first picture, notice that the right elbow rests on or near the
lower right corner of the desk. This position may be occasionally modified
to suit the needs of pupils. As an example, a very fat boy or girl may
find it necessary to let the right arm rest over on the desk a little farther.
A good rule to follow in finding the correct position of the right arm
on the desk for writing is as follows: Place the body at the desk in the
correct square front position, raise the entire right arm a few inches,
and withdrawing control, let it drop. Wherever it strikes the desk it
should remain. To draw the arm toward the side would force the right
shoulder upward into an uncomfortable, unhealthful position, or would
force the pupil to lean backward. On the other hand; to place the
right arm farther over on the desk would force the body too far forward.
These photographs show that the pupils sit comfortably in the
seats; that the upper ends of their penholders point a little to the right
of their right shoulders--usually half way between the elbow and the
shoulder; that the Palmer Method is placed at the upper left corner of
the desk-being held open at the required drill with a rubber band; that
the left forearm is on the desk in such a position as will keep the body
upright, the left shoulder from drooping, reserving the free use of the left
hand for changing the positions of the Manual and the paper as required.
In this position it is easy to push the sheet of paper forward as progress
is made toward the bottom of the page; also to move the paper to the
left when the writing has reached a third or half the distance across a
line, and back into the first position for a new line.
The exact position of the body at the desk and the relative positions
of the left and right arms in writing are very clearly shown in illustration
two, while the position of the left arm in its relation to desk, Manual,
and paper, is best shown in illustration three.
No student who fails in the matter of position will master muscular
movement writing. Correct position is of the greatest importance, and
it should be studied and thoroughly mastered before the writing itself is
considered.
To the Teacher s At this point, pupils should be required to close
their Methods and show their familiarity with the preceding discussion
of position by answering questions relating to it, and also to assume the
position described several times, to prove their working knowledge of it.70

Capital K is a natural companion to capital H. The beginning strokes in both letters are identical in size and shape.
LESSON 85
Drill 105
Careful study of the last part of K will be very much to the advantage of every student. Study it with the first part covered with a piece of
paper. Turn the copy upside down and study it in that position. Notice particularly that the loop grasps the first part a little above the center.
Drill 106
Thirty-five to forty to the minute will be a fair rate of speed. Compare your capitals frequently with the copy.
Are you studying the instructions?  They tell you just how to succeed.71
LESSON 86-Drill 107
This is a most excellent word to practice at this stage of the work. It is a good movement-developer. Give close attention to size, general
appearance, and space between letters, and guard against irregular movement. Keep the hand well up in front of the eyes and drive the pen lightly.
Write a half page of the copy and then make a careful study of your work. Try to write each line better than the preceding. Three words should
be written to the line.

REVIEW WORK
At this point it would be a good plan to review all the essential work of the preceding lessons. From one to two weeks should be spent
in such practice.
LESSON 90
Drill 112
Some authors make the loop of j and z shorter below the base than small y and g, but we make no distinction. The j begins like a small i and
ends with a loop. Small z should receive careful attention.
LESSON 91
SOMETHING MORE ABOUT SIZE
In these lessons is presented a style of writing that is easily and rapidly executed, and though large enough to be perfectly legible it is small enough
for general use. Examine the writing of the best business penmen in the large mercantile centers and it will be seen that this is true.74
It is a grave error to present for practice models larger than the pupils are expected to employ in their ordinary writing. And yet many
professional penmen continue to present models not only two or three times larger than good business writing is expected to be, but forms that
cannot possibly be executed at commercial speed.

Always start capital I with an upward stroke from below the base line. The upper part should be about one-half the width of the lower. The
crossing of the beginning with the main downward stroke should be one space above the base line. Practice the detached capital as well as the
word until there is an improvement in the movement and its application.

Practice the above copy in sections. Repeat capital I until the form is good when made rapidly, follow with several lines of the word "am,"
and continue to practice each word in the copy until uniformity in spacing, height, and slant have been developed. Then write a page of the
complete copy and criticise it.
As simple as it looks, there is material for several hours' practice in this copy.

The same method of practice should be followed in this drill as in the preceding one.

to criticse results. Height, spacing, and slant should receive special attention.85
In the following lessons are given copies in line-writing from which pages should be written. It may be easy for some students who cannot
maintain uniform excellence throughout a page to write one or two lines well. The object of your practice should be attractive work and commercial
speed. To attain this end, study the appearance of the finished line and page from time to time, and always try to harmonize the writing with the
space it occupies.
LESSON 116-Drill 139
Practice this copy as given. Write each word over and over, until the moton used is almost automatic and a marked improvement is shown
in the general appearance. Then write a few lines of the drill complete, and study the appearante.
LESSON 117-Drill 140
Do not rest a moment until you have filled one page with this copy; then judge the appearance as a whole. Do not write larger than the copy,
LESSON 118-Drill 141
Make a few lines of capital D before writing the line.
Do not lose sight of the fact that position at the desk has much to do with the development of writing.  Position refers to feet, body,
arms, wrist, fingers, pen, head, and paper. In preceding lessons enough has been said about these to make extended instructions here unnecessary.
LESSON 119-Drill 142
Uniformity may be hard to maintain in this copy. After writing a few lines pick out the faults and endeavor to correct them.86

LESSON 140-Drill 164
Work up to the complete copy by a systematic practice on the capitals and words separately.
LESSON 141-Drill 165
The author, in common with many teachers of business writing, has found the practice of combinations of capitals very helpful in developing
accuracy and freedom. This is an excellent part of the course in which to introduce such dnrlls, but tangled and dificult combinations should be avoided.
Drilt one hundred and sixty-five, if rightly practiced, will insure light movement and develop constructive ability. About twenty-two of this
combination should be made to a minute. It will be profitable to devote a full session to it.
FSSON 142
Drills 166 and 167
Practice the combinations of capitals several minutes before practicing the small letters. A perfect mastery of the following combinations will
help students in the work that follows. A few scattered lines will not meet the requirements. Write a full page.91
LESSON 143-Drill 168
Use uniform motion from beginning to end, and make about twenty-five to a minute.
LESSON 144-Drill 169
This affords a good drill and a good test of accuracy in applying movement. The last downward stroke in capital H is a left curve, is it not?
Study the direction of the pen in making it, and then strike boldly. This will be a good drill to practice frequently at the beginning of a lesson.
Drill 170
Use your eyes, focus your mind upon your work, study and practice earnestly, and you will be pleased with the results.92
