PREFACE.

--vw\»qf,'!2«\:,c~»—

THIS small volume, intended as a ﬁrst book for children, Will,
it is hoped, be found an acceptable aid to little learners in their
earliest eﬁbrts to ascend the ladder of learning.

S I in P L I o I T Y.—The lessons contain the most simple Words-
those With Which the EAR of the child is familiar. By the com-
bination of these Words in easy sentences, connected with
pleasing and impressive pictures, it is designed at once to ﬁx
the attention and to interest the mind, and in this Way to
make the lessons a medium for imparting ideas to the -child.

P R 0 G R E s S I 0 N .——A careful progression has been preserved,
thus leading the little learner forward, step by step, along an
easy gradation,~Which, While it pleases, Will at the same time
instruct him in the use and meaning of language.

SPEL LI N G .——Many of the Words in the spelling exercises
are very often repeated, that the pupil may f2-eqitently spell

them. Every teacher is aware that repetition is necessary in in"-"W"

structing young. children in this branch. _
This book is intended as an introduction to MCGUFFEY’S
ECLECTIC Fmsr READER.

Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1849, by W (NTHROP B.
