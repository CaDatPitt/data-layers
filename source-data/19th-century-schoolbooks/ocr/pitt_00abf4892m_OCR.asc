of Ql3antity; the iame holds alfo in FraAions, as well as
mixt Numbers.
5. In refpe&amp; of Quality, which is only a Similitude
6f Reafons, commonly called Proportion, it is confidered
betwixt'more than two Numbers': For tho"' the Reafon,
of two: Numbers may be had, as before, yet a Similitude
of Reafons cannot be found, urilefs the Numbers be more
than two;, and is threefold-: Firit, In refped of their-Di -
ference. Secondly, In refpe&amp; of their tuote. Thirdly,
In refpedt of both. Of the firfl, fpringeth Arith'metical;
of the fecond, Geometrical; of the third, Harmonical
Proportion.
- -46. Arithmetical Proportion, is an Equality of:Differences; that is to fay, when a Rank of Numbers: have'one-and th-e fame Difference; and this is two-fold, continued, or difcontinued.
47. Firif, Continued; when-of feveral, the 2d exceeds
or is lefs than the firff-by the fameT Number of Units, as
the 3d exceeds or is lefs than the fecond, or as the 4th exceeds or is lefs than the 3d, &amp;c.  So 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,,
&amp;c. are Numbers in Arithmetical Proportion, increafing
by 2. And x6, 13,'IQ, are Numbers in Arithmetical
Proportion, decreafing by 3. And 7, 2, 3, 4 s5, 6-,7,
are Numbers in Arithmetical Proportion, continued, increafing by Unity; and thefe are what is commonly called Arithmetical Progrefion.
48. Secondly, Difcontinued, that is, when there is the
fame Difference betwixt the ift and2.d,: as there i-s -bentwixt the 3d and 4th, butnot as between the zd and 3d.
So I, 3'7, 9, are four Numbers in Arithmetical Proportion. The Difference of I and 3, and of 7 and 9, being:; which is not the Difference of 3 and'7, which is 4-:-49. Geometrical Proportion is an Equality of Ratios;
that is to fay, -when feveral Numbers, being dividedby;one another, have feveral Quotients, and is either Continued or Difcontinued.  
50o. Continued, when of feveral: Numbers. the ifl
bears the fame Ratio, or Proportion to the 2d, as the zd
doth to the 3d, and as the 3d' doth to the 4th, &amp;c. Thus
2, 3, 4, 6, are Geometrical Proportionals continued,
fince there is the fame Reafon of 2 to 3, as of 4 to 6;

The Double, or Compound Rule of Three, may alfo be
greatly contraded by a Method of managing Vulgar Fractions, which the Reader will find explained in page I i6
following.-Let us, for Example, take the firft Queftion
in the Double Rule of Three, which is refolved at one
Operation page 86 foregoing. The-two firft Numbers
are there multiplied together for a firft Number or Divifor, and the two laft for a third Number, which, by the
Golden Rule, is to be multiplied by the fecond: And confequently, the three laft Numbers multiplied together
form the Dividend, and the Quotient arifing from thence
anfwers the Queftion. This being premifed, we fhall
proceed, according to this Ihort Method, to fQlve th;
Quertion, which, ija page 86, ftands thus,9    Cfro nsOra ns i t e Rde. of TI RRE

are required; the firft Number being always an Unit,:the
Queftion may- more quickly be wrought by the Aliquot

Then if you divide 55 and 629 feverally by 37, the two? Qotients will be I 5 and 17, which placed FraAionally, thus4-1,will
be-equal in value to the formerFradion, but in its leaft Terms.
So the greateit common Meafure of637 will be- found to be 9Ii;
by which dividingboth the numeratoraanddenominator,reduceth
the Frartion into its leait Parts, to wit, ~, and fo of any other.
But Fra&amp;ions may more quickly be abbreviated, if you can
defcry any Number that will evenly divide both your Numbers,
without leaving any Remainder, which in all even Numbers
mnay be done, by halving both as often as you can; if your
Numbers end with 5, or a Cypher, itmay be done by taking
Pi art, or Y1, Part; and. fo in many other.
So'~ 4 by hlalving, will be abbreviated into -, and _ -9 by
ta!ring  will be'come s the leait Parts required, as you may
ice iln the Work.
II.When feveral Fradions are given to be reduced into other
equivolentf~raftions,havinga common denominator, u fe this rule:
Multiply every Numerator into each Denominator/conltinuaily,t except its own, which fhall be:new Numerators; then
multiply all the Denominators into one another, for a colnmon
JDencminator, and your Work is finilhed.

III. Fra&amp;tions of diverfe Denomilations may be brought into

So if 3- of a Shilling, and 4 of a Poundc muif be brought
into the Fraftion of a Pound, you imay obferve that I of a
Shilling is ~- ofS- of a Pound, becaufe one Shillingis one twentieth of a Pound; which compound FraAion, when reduced by

If your Denominator be fixed, the Produ&amp; of ity and your
Integer given, will be the Numerator,
So if 7 were to be reduced into an improper Fraaion, whofe
Denominator Ihould be I i, the improper Fraation, anfwering,
would be Z7l and fo in any other,
But if it be a mixt- Number, then multiply the Integral Part
of-your mixt Number by the Denominator of your FraEtional
Part, and to, the Produ&amp; add the Numerator of the faid Fractional Part, the Sum will be the Numerator to the former Denominator.
So z  will be            will be 1 -,, e.
5, nd7 5 77
On the contrary, if you would reduce any improper Fraction into its equivalent whole or mixt Number, do thus:
Divide your Numerator by the Denominator, the Quotient
is the whole or integral Part, and the Remainder, if any, is
Numerator to the former Denominator.
So if?9 were reduced, it would be a whole Number, (,viz.)
5: Arid if 4- were reduced, it would be a mixt Number, to
wit, 3. 6, and fo of any other.
VI. To reduce a compound Fraaion into a fingle Fraction.
Multiply all the Numerators ohe into another for a new Numerator, and the Denominators one into another for a new Denominator, fo have you the fingle Fraftion fought.
So if 4 of s were reduced into a fingle FraAion, it would be
5; and     - o f3 would be f, or,.'
And thus much fhalllfuffice f6r Redu&amp;tion.

In Mutipi'cation of Vulgar Frations, reduce mixtNumbers
into improper Frations; whole Numbers, like Fraaions, and
compoundFra&amp;tions into fingle, abbreviatingwhere occafion is;
then the Rule is, Multply the Numerators together for a new
Numerator, and theDenominators together for a new Denominator,'which Numerator and Denominator is the ProduA fought.
EXA4MPL E S.
I. Let us multip1y7' by; the Produa will be, for z
times 4 is 8, and 9 times -3 is  1 7, which placed FraEtionalwiife isthe Produt foight.
As if it-were required to mul':iply z s. 6 d. by 2 s. 6 d. as the
ra~ioin of ~at Pound, z25. 6 d.:'being ~I of a Pound; multiply i. by, Facit ofta Pound equal to o. s. 3. 3 By which
it is ~evident, that Multiplication of Fra&amp;ions decreafes the
Value in'tie"fame Prbportion-as whole N'umbers'in'creafe it, as
is intimated further in Multiplicatio-n' of Decimals.
-      S  i multiplied 1by  becomes i.: See this demonftrated in
Mr. Leyturn's Cjii/iis MathernatZic:s, Pag. 38.
I. If on.e be an Integer an-d the other a FraCtion, as if we
would multiply "by;'the Produt will be 4,, for 7 made
like a Fraction is; then as before.'So' if s~ weie to be multiplied by i2, the Produt would be

IlT. If both be mixt Numbers, as if z2  mult be multiplied

GEometrical Pogreffon is,. when a Rank of Numbers, aboe two increafe or decreaie by an equal Ratio.;
-that is, by the continual Multiplication or Divifion of'
rome equal Number.
So 2, 4,. 8, 6, 32, 64, and I2I5, 405, 1-35, 45, I5, 5,
are two. Ranks of Numbers in G eometrical Progreffion,.

doublle Rati-o.And the 2d defcending-or decreafing, by continuallydividing the preceding Term by 3, or in,a triple Ratio.
In any Geometrical Progreflion, the fame Things areto be, confidered as in Arithmetical Progreflion: As firft,.

Hence may arife this Gorollary-:
That the firft Term "of an infinitq defcending Geometrical Progreflion, where the Ratio is -4ouble, is equa

But if the Ratio be triple, the firft Term is double the

Wherefore, As Io8: to 54:: So is i-62:;to 8I, the
Sum of all the refti ad Infinitum.
Wherefore the D,ifference of the two firft Terms,. the

Hence may arife this. Corollary:
That when the two firfi, or greateft Terms, differ on1y by.,Unity;. the Square of the firft Term is equal to the

Thus you fee the Denominator of a Decimal FraAion
may very well be omitted, becaufe eafily known, being
always an Unit with as many Cyphers annexed as there
are Places in the Numerator.
Note aIfo, That Cyphers placed to the Left-hand of
an Integral Number, or to the Right-hand of a Decimal,
neither increafe nor decreafe the Value; buteplace-dcontrary,:work contrary Effe&amp;s:'for as Cyphers placed to
the Right-hand of an Integer, increafe the Value in i
tenfold Proportion; fo Cyphers placed to the Left-hand
of a Decimal Fra6?ion, decreafe the Value in the fame
Proportion...
So 5 Pounds, by annexing a Cypher to the Right-hana,
becomes 5o Pounds, ten times more than before: So 5!.,or xo s. by annexing a Cypher to the Left-hand, become

SIGNS    made Ufe of in this    7 Work.
+ p-  L U S, or mere, the Sign of Arddition; and,
P    when placed between two Numbers, fignifies
that they are to be added:together; as 5+-6 denotes,
that 5 and 6'are to,beadlded into one Sum.
- Minus, or lefs, the Sign of Subtraaion; and, when
it ftands between two Numbers, denotes that the latter
is to be fubtra&amp;ded from the former; as 7-3, is 7 lefs 3,
and fignifies that 3 is to be fubtraAed from 7.
X Is the Sign of Multiplication, and fignifies, when
placed between two Numbers, that they are to be multiplied together: Thus 2X 3 is 2 multiplied by 3.
-  Is the Mark of Divifion; and fignifies, when two
Numbers are placed one above another, that the Num6
ber above is to be divided by that below: As- or 6 2,
denote that 6 is to be divided by 2.
='The Sign of Equality; and, when placed between
two numerical SExpreffions, denotes that they are equal
between themfelvesm - As 7-- 3=8+2-. That is, the
Sum of 7 and 3 is equal to the Sum of 8 and 2.: Implies to, and:: fo is. They are Marks of Proportionality, fignifying that the Numbers between which
they are placed are proportional; As 2: 4:: 8: I6
fignifies, as 2 to 4 fo is 8 to i6,

How many feveral Combinations with- their Vriations
are there of Three Letters of the Engli/h Alphabet?
R ~U L E.
Multiply all its feveral Combinations 2o24 by its
Changes 6, and the Produ&amp; z   sI244 is the Number ofplacihng three Letters of the Alphabet with all its Variations.
From this Mutability of Variations and Combinations,.
it is no"Marvel that by 24 Letters -there arifeth and is
made fuch Variety of Languages in the World, and fuch
infinite Number of Words in each Language, feeing the.
Diverfity of Syllables produceth that Effe,l- and alfo by
interchanging and placing of Letters amongft the Vowelsand among themfelves, make thofe Syllables; for the
Alphabet of 24 Letters may be varied thus many times
(viz.) 62o4484:oI733239439360000..Now if you take in the Combinations with the feveral
Variations of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. Letters, there may be
made and compofed fuch a vait Number of Viords, that
if a Man could read 50 Thoufand Words in an Hourc
which is more thani the- Pfalms of David contain (a Tafi
too great for any M/an to perform) and if there were a
Hundred Thoutfnd Mdillions of Men, -they vould not
fpeak thefe Words according to -the hourly Proportion
before mentioned, in a hundred Thoufand Years; a thing
feeming mot im poftible and incredible, yet moft certain
and infallible in Computation.
Hence likewife-it may appear how many Ways the
Letters of aName or Word may be varied, and differently
difpofed Lby way of Anagram  out of whiclh thofe of
Y, way.0        U.Eariation and Cozinhatzion of   iaZntzies. i 5
UTfe may be' gathered, negledcing the re t; -as for Example, the lXVord Roma, confifling of 4 different Letters,
may admit of 24 Changes, as hereafter.
Roma Orml tMroaArom      Of which "thefe, to.wit,
R.oam Oram Midrao Armo Roma, Ramo, Orarn,.Mora,
Rmoa Omra Mora iorm   Maro, Jrmo, Amor, are onRmao Omar Mtar Aomr- ly ufeful, and all, the reft
Raom Oarm M4aro.Amro ufelefs.
Ramo'Oamr Maor Amor
But if there be two or more Letters of a Sort, divide
the whole Number of Changes by.the Changes of the
"Number of thofe Letters, and the Q,uotient is the Num.ber of Changes defired.  
So if the Word Pbilippa were given, which confifteth
of:8 Letters, of which (without conlfidering thofe which
are' of the fame-Sort) the Changes 1 will be 4032o; but
b'ecaufe I is twice repeated, i' d~iv'lde 40320 by 2, the'Changes on'2 Letters, the Quote is 2o060, and this divided again by 6 the Changes or 3, becaufe P i's thrice: repeated,. gives in the Quotint 3360, which are the
Changes in ihe'Word Philippa,'Or if I had divided 4032o by'2 (becaufe 2 times 6
-is i2') the Quotient will give in the /hzfwer, at one Operation, -the famte aS befre.
After this Manner may be found the Variations or
-Cbanges which may be made of fome particular.Latin
Verfes,' fo as to keep the Rules of a true Verfe, and the
Senfe grammatically the fame."
So if the two followin'g Verfes were chofen (vi'z.).Lex', Rex,:Grex,r Res, $pes, yus, Thus,, Sal, Sold, (bona)

-It is very re'markable"how manay fundry W Tays the fame
nm.ay be varied; and yet the Senfe remain good, and-the'Verfe grammatically true;- for if we fuppofe the Words
BoZna and Mala continually to keep the fame (to wit, the
"otiit) Place, the reft being I I in Number, indifferently
changing place with any other in the fame- eafe; the
Number of Variations of Ii Places will be 399x68o00

5 account one Shilling more; then the 2d. Figure, if
under 5,'or the Excefs, if above 5, added to the 3d, is

But feeing we have for the moft part, but Occafion for
three or four Figures after the Separatrix, and fometimes
the Multiplications are tedious and long; we will there,
fore give you a Rule how you may contra&amp;tc your Work,
and yet fecure wi at Places of Decimals you pleafe. To
do which, obferve the following Method.
Having fet down your Multipland as ufual, fet theUnits Place of your Multiplier under that Figure in your
Multiplicand, which ftands as far from Unity as the laft
Figure of your Produd&amp;t is defired to ftand, and write the
reft in the Inverfe Order; then multiply by your Multiplier, as ufual; only Note, That you need only begin in
your Multiplicand, with that Figure that ftands over the
Figure you multiply by; having arefpeat to the Increafe
that would come fromr, the following Figures of the Multiplicand, placing every fingle Produ&amp; exa&amp;ly even at the
Right-hand, contrary to the common Way, and adding
them as they ftand, you muft cut off fo many Figures in
your Product as was defigned, which you may better underftand by the VWfork of the following Example.

When a Decimal Fradtion or tnixt Number is to be
multiplied by an Unit with Cyphers (as io, ioo, Iooo,
&amp;c.) you need only to remove the Separatrix fo many
Places towards the Right-hand as there are Cyphers anlexed to the Unit. So if.1278 were to be multiplied.

Div/fion in DECIMALS.
Divfion in Decimals differs nothing from Divifion of
Integers, either in placing the NuLmbers, or in the Work
itfelf: All the Difficulty being in difcovering the true Value of the Q2uotient; which to do, obferve the following
Rule, which is but the Converfe of that in Multiplication,
and is this that follows..... k As92z     Div ion in DE C:IMALS.
As many Figures as are cut off in the Dividend, fo'miany
muft be cut off in the DivifQr and Quotient; or thus, So
many Figures muft be cut off in the Quotient, as will
make thofe, cut off in the Divifor, equal to thofe in the
Dividend; taking notice if there be not fo many in the
Quotient, you muft add Cyphers to the Left-hand. Note
a/yo, If your Dividend be an Integer, or have lefs cut off
than is in the Divifor, it is convenient you add Cyphers
to the Dividend,'till they be equal or more; then the'Work will be eafy.

Extration of the Square Root.
SquareNumber is that which is contained under two
equal Numbers, or which is equally equal.
So 4 is a fquareNumber, contained under 2equal Nunmbers.; to wit,; and 2; for two times  is 4: And the
fquare Number 9 is contained under 3 and 3; for 3 times: makes 9g and of the reft as in the followving Table.,4 Table of Squares, with their Genitive equal NNumbers, a~
far as the/ fiy 9 Dig-its.

And vhen it is required to extra&amp;'the fqulare Root of
any given Number, we have nothing to do but to find
that equal Number of which it is compofed: So if tbhe
Root of I6 were required, it would be found to be 4, as
in thle faid Table-.
Here 4 is the Root, called by fome the firl- Power=
tind i6 is the Square, called' the fecond Power.
Of Numbers to be extradled, are three Sorts.
Fiji, Sin'le.
SeCo,lYg, Compound.'hirdly, Irrational.

of any of the 9 Digits; of which Sort are thofe i  tle
aft%regoing Table,  
Compourld'T..   I,. I.I  E2xfrafion of the S]uare Root.        2 I
Compound are all fuch Squares that are compofed of
more Figures than One, as Ioo, whofe Root is Io; I2I,
whofe Root is I; or 144, whlofe Root is 12, &amp;c.
Irrational are all fuch Squares, whofe Roots cannot be.difcovered by Art exadcly, neither in whole Numbers or
Fra&amp;ions, but fomething will fiill remain, there being
no Proportion yet found betwixt an irrational Number
and its Root; fuch Numbers are 3, 7. 19. 74. i56-'75I, &amp;c.
The Extraaion of the Square Root is not much unlike
D'ivifion; only there our Divifoi is fixed, here we are to.
feek a new one for each Operation.
The Root of any fingle fquare Number is found by In.
fpeEtion, as'in the foregoing Table may be feen.
But if it be a compound fquare Number, it muff be
prepared by pointing thus: Make a Point under your
Unit's Place, and omitting one, point-every other Figure.
And as many Points as your Number contains, fo manly
ligures will-your Root confift of.
Then proceed by the following Dired&amp;ions.

The Square Root ofa Vulgar Fra&amp;ion, that is comnmenfurable to its Root, may eafily be found, by extra&amp;tinothe Square Root of the Numerator for theNumerator of,
the Rd'ot,' andlikewiife the Square Ro6t of the Denominator for the Denominator of the faid Root, which Fraction is th6Rootfought. Soif the Square Root, 9were
required, it would be found to be 7, for the Square Root
of g is 3, of 49 is 7, equal to -!: and fo of any other.
After this manner may the Square Root of a mixt N umber, which is cormfienifurable to its Root, be eafily founld.
But if your Firat;on be-'incommenfLirable to its Root,
then the heif w;y will be to reduce it into a Decimal, and.
extras6 the Root as before taught.

But if you have it to fall in Ioine Operation, you may

In the laft Place, I will fhew how to find a Square
Root of an irrational.Number nearly, without the h-Help
of Decimals, being a ufeful Notion for fuch as underfiand
not thiofe Fraftions: And it is thus.
After you have found the integral Part of your Root, to
its Quadruple, add Uni'ty for the Denominator of' the
frac&amp;ional Part, and theRemainder doubled is Numerator:
So the RoQt of i6o in this Method will be I2'a; and
thus of any other.

Extraclion of the Cube Root.
X.     Cube Nuimber is that which is contained under
3 equal Numbers, or which is equally equal.
So 8,is a Cube Number, contained under 3equal Numbers, to wit, 2, 2 and 2, for. 2 times 2 is 4, and 2 times
4 is 8-; and the Cube Number 27, is contained under 3, 3
- nd 3, for 3 times 3 is 9, and  times 9 is 27; and o
the rfef as in the following Table,:A TABLE of Cubes, with their Genitive equal Numbers
as far as the 9 Digits.

And when it is required to extra&amp; the Cube Root of
any given Number, we ha've nothing to do but to find
that equal Number of which it is compofed; fo if the.Root of 64, were required, it would be found to be 4, as
ifi the Table.
H-ere 4 is the Root, or firft Power, and 4 times 4 is i6,
the fecond Power, and 4 times i6 is 64, or the third
Power, which is the Cube.
Ouf Cube Numbers to be extradced, are three Sorts.lxtraczon of the Cube Roof.         22 l
Firf, Single.
Secondly, Compound.
Thirdly, Irrational.
Single are all fuch Cubes as are compofed or ymade up
of-any of the 9 Digits, of which Sort are thofe in the
foregoing Table6
Compound are all fuch Cubes that are compofed of more
Figures than one, as Iooo, whofe Root is Io, or I331,
whofe Root is I I, or I728, whofe Root is 12, &amp;c.
Irrational are all fuch Cubes, whofe Root cannot be
difcovered by Art exaEtly, neither in whole Numbers,
nor FraAions, but fomething will frill remain, there being no Proportion yet found betwixt an'irrational or
Surd Number and its Root; fuch Numbers' are 5, 7. 36.

The ExtraAion of the Cube Root participates fomething of the Nature of Divifion, yet a deal more difficult.
The Root of any fingle CubeNumber is found by Infpic-.
tion, as in the foregoing Table may be feen,
-But if it be a Compound Cube Number, it mufr be

This agrees With Example th.e Firfi, in the firf P1ropofition of this Se&amp;ion.
Note, But if this were wrought by the common Tables
of Sitmple intereft, fhewing the prefent Worth of Annuities, printed in feveral Books of Arithmetick, the Anfwer
would be found to be 13/. 19s. 6 d. 3 q.fere. So, if their
Tables be true, he that gives I I61. 6 s. 9 d. 4, is cheated
of 21. 7 S. i2 d.-; but this we will try.
A lends B 1131 19 s. 6. 4 for 7 Years, which at the
End thereof amounts to i6I 1. I6s. I d. I -; this is not
deny'd. At the fame time B delivers up to A anl annual
Rent of 20o. per nnum,z, to continue the Jame Term, and
accordingly received it annually. Now the Q(uefion is,
whether the Reception of theSe 7 annual Payments quit
the Scores between A and B, both being obliged under

but it may appear to any confiderate Man it doth not

H E Rule of Fellowihip is for Merchants or other
T   Traders, where they have joint Stocks in Company, to diftribute to every one his propprtional Share
of the Gain or Lofs, according to his Stock laid out.
It is divided into two Parts, commonly called theJingle
and double Rule of FellowJhip, of which in their Order.
In thefingle Rule, having the particular Stocks, and
the whole Gain or LIofs, to find each particular Gain or
Lofs, obferve this general Rule;
As the total Sum of the Stocks:

So each: Man's particular Stock

that you may work any fuch Queftion, obferve this general Rule.

N.oiec, That 9, i., 24, 3o, I call the Extremes; 9 and

greaterhe Rule of Alligation.            295
greater: Then on the other hand fet down the mean
Price, as you fee.
That done, I link or join together two Extremes, no
matter which, fo as one be bigger than the Mean, and
the other lefs;.and after that other two, till I have
finifhed.  So in this Example, I link 9 and 30 together
and 12 and 24, as you fee; then take lthe Difference betwixt each Extreme and the mean Price, and place it:over-againft its Yoke-fellow: So the Diff-erence betwixt 9
and 20z is ii, which place againft 30 its Yoke-fellow; the
Difference betwixt 12 and 20o is 8, which place againPf 24
its Yoke-fellow; betwixt 24: and 20 is 4, which place agailnft- I its Yoke-fellow; and laPfly, the Difference betwixt 30 and 20 is o, which place
over-againft 9 its Yoke-fellow, as you   9-    10
fee -here done. And the Differences     12here found will be the Anfwer to the  20
Queftion; for as oft as he takes Iolb. l 24  
of 9 d. a Pound, he muft take 4 of 2 d.  30-   I I
Pa Pound, and 8 at 24d. the Pound;
tlat fo a Pound may be afforded for 2od. or is. 8d.
The Proof thereof is eafy by the lafP Variety; for the
Sum of the Difference found, multiplied by 20, is equal
to the Sum.of the Produt&amp;s of the Difference and Exstremes. But if at any time, as here it happens, that the
Extremes may be linked more ways than one, then the.Quftion admits of moreAnfwers than one, yet all true;
for if in this Queftion, we link 9and 24,
and.12 and 30, and place the Differences
reCpeaively, then we hall have 4 at 9 d.  |12--  I
aPound, o atI2d. aPound,  IIat 24d. 20o

that this is likewife true, may beprov-  3o --  8
ed, as in the laft, and the mean Price
will be found to be zod.
Again, if we link 9 and 3~
together, I12 and'30, and Iz    9  
and 24, there will arife a new              4   0 1~4

9 and 20 is I, which place over-againfr 30, its Yoke'
fellow; the Difference betwixt 12 and 20 is 8, which,
becaufe it has two Yoke-fellows, place againft them both,
to wit, againfi 24 and 30, as you fee; the Difference
betwixt 24 and 20 is 4, which place againft I 2 its Yokefellow; and laftly, the Difference betwixt 3o and 20 is
so, which place againft both its Yoke-fellows, to wit, I 2
and.   l'Then draw a firait Line, and beyond it the
Differences; fo firfi i fet down a o, then ten and 4 is I4,
which fet down; then fet down 8, then II and 8 is I9,.which likewife place down; then as oft as he takes IO at
9d. the Pound, he muff take I4 at 12ad. the Pound, and
8 at 24d, the Pound, and 19 at 3od. the Pound, fo that
a Pound may be worth 2od.
And'lafily, if we link 9 both with 24 and 3o, and 12
both with 24 and 30, and 24 both with I2 and 9, and 30
both with, I2 and g, then the

z2 and 9, for the fame Reafon; then on the other Side
the Line, place the Sum of the Differences againft their
refpedive Numbers, as you fee in the Example: So by
this A/ligation, you will find, he muft take I4 lb. at 9 d.
and 2zd. the-Pound, and I9 lb. at 24d. and 3od. to
make a.Pound worth 20 od.
I fhall not name any more ways of linking thefe Numbers, thefe being fufficient to underfiand how to link them

thefe Examples, that I may. not trouble myfelf any more
with the Method of linking in the Exatmples following;
only Note, that if at any time you have but one Extreme,

A Merchant hath Wines; Canary at 24d. the Quart,

how much of each Sort muft he take
to fell a Quart at I8 d.? This Que-  24-- 2.6 8
fion you fee admits but of one way  I
of linking, and fo but one Anfwer;
and obferving the Diredions before  12--   6  6
given, you will find 8 of Canary, 6
of Sherry', and 6 of Malaga murf be mixed together, that
fo a Quart may be fold for 18d.
It muff however be obferved, that tho' the Rule of lligation will give but one Anfwer, yet all Numbers that
are in the fame Proportion between themfelves, as the
Numbers which compofe the Anfwer, will likewife fatisfy
the Condition of the QteRtion. Thus 4 Quarts of Canary, 3 of Sherry, and 3 of Malaga, will compofe a
Mixture worth  8 d. p'er Quart. For as 8: 6:: 4: 3.
In like manner 24 Quarts of Canary, I8 of Sherry, and!8 of Malaga, will alfo fatisfy the Queffion.  For as
8: 6:: 24: I8. And after the fame manner an infinite
Number of Anfwers may be found.
Nor is this all; for by the Help of a particular Method,
which we fhall now explain, an innumerable Number
of other Anfwers may be found, without the Numbers
which compofe them being in the fame Proportion.
Let us, tor inftance, fuppofe that the Merchant is determined to ufe 6 Quarts, of Malaga conftantly in the
Mixture; but to increafe or diminifh the Canary or
Sherry, in any Proportion, that will produce a Mixture
worth I8 d. per Quart.
Then may the Quantity of Canary be increafed or diminifhed by 2, the Difference between the Price of the
Sherry and the Price of the Mixture, provided the Quantity of Sherry be, at the fame time, increafed or diminiihed by 6, the DiffTrence betweeen the Price of the Canary and the Price of the Mixture. That is, the Canary
may be increafed to io Quarts, if, at the fame time, the
Sherry be increafed tg 12.
for298        I'h  Rule Rule ofligaioz.
For xo Quarts of Canary, at 24 d. are worth 240de
12 QQuarts of Sherry, at x6d. are worth i92d.
6 Quarts of Malaga, at I 2 d. are worth  72 r,
Therefore 28 Quarts of the Mixture are worth  504d.
And   I Quart            is worth l.i4 or 8 d.
The fame may be done by diminifhing both the Quan-.
fifies, infi:ead of increafing them. And if, infiead of the
Numbers found, others in the famre EProportion be taken,
a prodigious Number of Anfwvers may be found.
If the Sherry be fuppofed invariable, then the Quantity of Cainary;nay be increafed by 6, the Difference between the Prices of the Malaga arid the Mixture, provided, at the'fame time, the:Qe antity of Malaga be increafed by 6, the Diflerence between the Prices of the
Mixture and Canary. That is, the Quantity of Canary
may be increafed to 14 kQ5arts, provided", at the fame
tirtme, the. Malaga be encreafed to i2.
For IA. Q.uarts of Canary, at 24d. are worth 336d,
6 Quarts of Sherry, at 6 d. are worth  96 d.
I 2  uarts of Malaga, at 2   d. areworth, I44d.
Therefore 32 Quarts of the Mixture- are worth 576d.
And   I Quart              is worth 5-736 or 8d.
-If-the Canary be fuppofed invariable, theQuantity of

Note, Some of the foregoing Q.ueftions miaybe wrought
by the Single Rule of Falfe; though notwithftan-ding they
may be wrought by two Suppbofitions, as you may try at
your Leifure. And to conclude, any Quefion w hatfo-.
ever, if not iinpoflible, may be refolved; if by comp:rring, adding, fubtraacting, or Proportion, you couild prove
your Queftion, if the true Refolution was given; for
otherwife the Queftion cannot be rebfolved, becaufe you
cannot come to, know what the Errors were at the Pofltions;- but then they muft be wrought by Algebra.
In the next Place, we fliall proceed to Logarit/,metical

chiefeft Ufe in Arithmetick being in refolving Queftions
concerning Compound IntereJi and Annuities.
Logarithmical ARITHM ET I CI.
T0 GAIRITIHMS are artificial Numbers which differ equally, fitted to the natural, for Eafe in Calculation.
The Firft Figure, called the Index, or Charalerflick,
Ihews how many Figures the anfwering Number confifts
of, which are always more by one than the Index, if the
fame be whole.
Sothe Index of any Number under to, is (o); betwixt
to and'oo (1); betwixt loo and Iooo is (2), &amp;c.
The Logarithm of a Ffradi'on, or Decimal Number, is
all one as an Integer, only with this Difference for the
Sf                    Index,g3i 6     Conrz.ii,C   of' Logaritbms.
Index, that if the firft Figure of the Decimal to the Lefthand be fignificant, the Index i (.)3; if there be one
Cypher befbre it, the Index is (.8,) &amp;c.

Thus you may fee the Logarithms are the fame, but
the Index thereof differethl, according as the firit Fig:,re
thereof is removed from Uanity.
Confrz  tio onf Logarith  ms.
Their Conftru6tion, according to the common Rules,
given by many ExtraSions of Roots, is tedious; the beft
Way yet' known is this, which follows.
oi make a Table of ]Logarit3ms,
- Firfl, Put -for the Logtarithm of I, a -Cypher for the
Inidex, and a competent Number f Cyphers for the Logarithm, according to the Number of Places you would
have your Logarithms confift of; for 0o an Unit, with
the faime Number of Cyphers; for ioo, 2, with as many
Cyphers; for: I00, 3, with as oanyCyphers, &amp;c.
Secondly, Find the Difference between fome two Logarithms, above Ioco, or rather above Ioooo, that differ
by Unity; thus, Mlultiply the two Numbers together, and
that Produd you mnuff multiply again by 43429448 I903251-83896; -which laft Produ Ctdivided bythe Arithmetlcal Mean between both Numbers, the Quotient is the
D,ifference fought.
Supp6fe we' would find -the Difference between the
Log. i o0oo and I ooo, the P-roduct of thefe two Numbers is.0oooIoooo, which multi.p.ed by 4343 produceth
444334343; this dividedd by Io100.5, quotes'4343. N-ow'
if" to the Logarithm of 0oqooQ w.ich is +4oQ0oo0o, you
addtio find a LogarS    t Ay he rables.   317
add th:e Difference before found, to wit,4343, the Suimr
40o00034 is the true Logarithm of I10I to 7  Places.
Thirdly, Having thus fo-und the Differeice of any tw'o
tLgarithms Difference by Unity, and confequently fome
of fhe Logarithms by dividing the Difference fou-nid by'
the arithmetical Mean, betwveen any two Numbers Differe-nce by Unity, you fliall have the Difference of thie
L6garithfim of thof&amp; two Numbers.
Thus to fiid thd Difference between the Logaritht of
274 and 275; divide 434-3, the Difference of the Lo&amp;arithm of I Oooo, and I -bo I by 74.5, the Quotient I 5 82 I,
is the Difference fought.
Fourthly, Having by this Means found a few of the
prime Logarithm'is, the reft are made by Addition and
SubtraAion; and having made the Canon upward, above
IQoo to Ioooo, by conilequence'tis made for all inferior
Numbers.
The prime Nuntbers to whlch Logarithms muft be
found. in the firft Place, are thefe, 2. 3. 7. I1. 3. 17  
19. 23 z9    31 37 ~4. 43. 47. 53. 59.6     67.
7I. 73. 79. 89. 97, &amp;c. or the fame Numbers with
Cyplers. There being feV&amp;ral Tables of Logarithms, -we
iall 6only explain tiofe, rhich in this Place wehave made
ufe of, which are Mr1. Oaghtred's in his Trigonometry,
they being of as good, if not a, better Chara&amp;tr thain aty'
extant;.fid the Logarithms extended to 7 Places after the
Index. Of the fame Sort are' Mr. Guiner,s, Mr. Norwood's,
1Vi~?' Leyburni's, &amp;c. BRut we muft do Mr. Briggs thaf J&amp;ftice, to fayr, they are all fofom his O'rigi'nal Table.
The Logarithm of any Numbei under ioooo, is found
by Infpetion; fo the Logarithm of 1234 is 3.09135 I;
but. if your Number given confifts of 5 or 6 Places, then,o0' miuf Ii.fe Proportion: Thus fee:k for the firft 4, as beYor&amp;, nioting the Difference betwixt thlat Logaittin and
the next greater; then fay, As xo, if your' Number confi.fs of 5 Places, or as xoo, if of 6 Places:: To the laid
Diference: So the Figuire, or Figures wanting to the
Part proportioial, which added to the Log"arithm' b-efore
found; the' gum (when a true Chara&amp;eritick or Index
is fitted): To the Logarithm of the Numhrb-r foug.ht.
So thle Loartithm of I234:5 is 4.091494'i0 t
And of 1z356 is 4.o0918778 &amp;c.
Sf z                   To318        ~ Addition of Logarithms.
To find the Number anfwering a Logarithm given, is
but the Converfe; the firft four Figures are found by Infpec2ain: But if you want fr 5 or 6 Places, \do thus;
flek the Logarithm next lefs, arid againft it are the four'firft Figures; then feek the Difference betwixt that and
the next greater, as likewife betwixt the given Logarithm and the next lefs, and fay, as the firft Difference:
To Io, i- for 5 Figures, or to Ioo, if for 6 Places:: So
the other Difference: To the remaining Figure or Fi
gures fought.
So the Number anfwering 4o0918778 isZX2356, as
above.
Addition of Logarithms.
In' Zddition take this general Rule.
A General Rule.
If your Indices be affirmative, add them as ufual, and
you have the true Sum.
But if they be negative, add them as before; only note,
That if the Sum of the Indices be under Io, add io; if
juft xo, add Unity; if above Io, caft xo away, the Sum,
or Remainder, will be negative.
But if the Indices be of different Kinds, that is, onle
affirmative and the other negative, add them alfo.
If the Sum be io, or above, cat away Io, the Re-..
mainder is affirmative; if under 1o, negative.

of the Nunmber belongngin  t ttlhe fecond Year, and to that
Sum add again the Log. of the Rate, gives the Log. of the

Let'there be two Nurrmbers of three Denominitiions'
given, and let A F be the Square or Re&amp;angle, made of
the greatefi Denomination in both Numbers, EK and'
B G tw6 Re&amp;angles, made byMultiplying the ift Denomination-by the, 2d; the Produ6t divided by an Integer of
the gre-te-ft Denomination reduced into the Parts of the'
d; the'Quotient fhall be of the fame Denomination with
theGreat&amp;tf, and the Remainder of the fame Denominati6n wit'h the 2d.
2. FL is the Square oifthe 2dD:nomintion,W'hichbing divided by an Integer of the greateift, reduced into:the
Parts of the zd, the Quotient ihall be of the fame DenomInination with the 2d, and if there be any Remainder, it
muf be mnltiplied by a Number,wich, in the. 3d Denomination is equal to an Integer in the d., the Quotient
thall be of the 3d Denomination: And if there be yet a
Remainder, it muf be multiplied by a Number, which
in the 4th Denomination is equal to an Integer in the 3d,
and divided as before, the Quotient fhall be of the 4th'
Denomination: and fo forwardl till the Remainder cannot be reduced into.leffer Terms. And thus we have done

~. C H and I O are two Reaangles made by the Multiplication of the Sum of thegreateft Denomination given,
by the Sum given, which is of the 3d inferior Denomination; the Produet fhall be of the fame Denomination
with the 3d; and therefore if Ithat Produu&amp; be greater
than an Integer of the 2d Denomination, reduced inte
the Parts of the 3d; it muff be divided by a Number,
which in the 3d Denomination is equal to an Integer in
the 24: the Quotient {hall be of the 2d Denomination,
and the Remainder of the 3d.
4. GM and KP are two Re&amp;angles made by multiplying the Sum of the 2d Denomination by the 3d, and
the Produ&amp; being divided by one of the Integers in the
greateft Denomination, reduced into the Parts of the zd,
the Quotient fhall be of the fame Denomination with the
3d, and the Remainder nuft be multipled by a Number
which in the 4th Denomination is equal to an Integer; in
the 3d, the Quotient Ihall be of that 4th Denomination,
and the Remainder fhall be the Numerator of a Fradion,
whofe Denominator is that former Divifor,

Proof of MULTIPLICATION.
There are. feveral Ways to prove Multiplication; but
-the only Proof is by Divifion; but that being! not yet
learned, we fhall forbear -that Way. for the prefent.
Another WVay mentioned by feveral Authors, is, by
caftin.;away the-Nines, both in the Multiplicand, Multiplier, and Produ&amp;. But this Way being erroneous, we
fhall mention it no farther.
A third Way, and that which we {hall ufe at prefent,
is by making Multiplication to prove itfelf, thus: Make
that which was yoour Multiplicand your Multtiplier;: then
-multiplying as ufual, if ybur Produ&amp;t be the fame, your

-TY   DIftIS ION we difcover how often one Num.
-   ber is contained in another.
-n Dividon are three principal Parts to be taken Notice of.
Firfi, The Dividend, or Number to be divided.
Secondly, T'he Divijor, or N umber by which we divide.
Thirdly, Tlhe tuotient, or Number proceeding from
the other, two.
Sometimes by accident there is a fourth Number,
called a Remainder.
in.Div~ion it holds,
As the Divifor: To an Unit:
So ithe Dividend: To the Quotient.
$o if 4 Yards coft 32 Shillings; what will one Yard
coft?

Divifion is either Single or Compound.
Single Divifion is when the Divifor is but one Figure,
and the Dividend but two at the moft, as in the Queitiona
befo-e going. And this fort of Divifion may either be performed b v'h~ Memory, or at molt by the Table of Multiplication, by feeking your Divifor on the Top of the:
T-abt t, running down the fame till you find the Dividend,
and over againif it, in the firft Column is your Quotient
fought.:Compound Divifion is when the Dividend confifteth
of imany Places, and the Divifor of one or more Places.
When a Queftion of Compound Divifion is propound,
ed to be wrought, you mulf proceed acc9rding to the
Work-of the following Rule.
Firft write down your Dividend, making a crooked.Line at either end:hereof, that one the Left-hand to contain the Divifor, and that on the Right-hand- for the
Quotient; and having placed your Divifor in its place,
diftinguifh with a Point- fo many Places' of your Dividend towards your Left-hand, as are equal, or next exceeding your Divifor; and- aking how oft your Diviforis'
contained in the faid Sum, the Anfwer muff be placed
in your Quotient -on the Right-hand the Dividend; then
niultiply your Divifor by,the Figure laft placed in your
Quotient, fetting your Produt under your aforefaid
4liftinguifhed Sum;. and drawing a Line under both,
take the lower from the higher, and to the Remainider, point and bring down your next Figure of the
DiviD Din in INT          G; R  
DiVidend, with which proceed as,you did with your di_
Itinguiflhed Number, and fo on till you have pointed and
brought down all the Fig-uies of your Dividend. And
NTote, That as many Points as you have made in your
Divided, fo many-Figures will be in the Quotient; all'which will be made more plain in the Work of the foli
lowing Exanmples.

Thall -fay -fometh,iing'of Divifion- of'Numbers of diverfe
Denominations.
Atnd firif when the Dividend is, a Number of diveffe
Denominations, -and the Divifors an Integer; and for~
~Example take the following Qieflion.

h3. The Cypher, Nll, randing by itfelf, fignifieth Nothing;:- but eing joined with otherNumbers, increafeth,
or decreafeth their Value, and is indeed the Beginning of
all Number, as we ffiall elfewhlere demonftrate, contrary
to what racquet,:and fome,other modern Artifls affirm. -
4. Number is compofed of one or a Multitude of Units,
and is that by which we fay any,thing is numbered; as
I Acre, 4 Crowns, 7 Days in a WVeek.
5. Of'Numbers are feveral Sorts; as Digits, Articles,
Compou.nds,-whole, broken, mixed, &amp;c.  
6. Digits are fuch Numbers as are under Tens, as 2,
3, 4, 5, &amp;c.
7. Articles are fiuch Numbers as are compofed of a
Digit and a Cypher, as Io; 20,3o, &amp;c. and are divifible.by i o without a Remainder.
8. Compound Numbers are fuch as are compounded
of many Numbers, as 144, z82, i702,' 728, &amp;c.
9. A whole Number either contains Unity, or fome
Numbe'r thiereof; as 7,2,21, 5I2, z256; - c.'.  
10. A Fraaion, or broken Number, is always lefs than
Unity, as -3 reprefent three- Qarters of any Thing, or.nity; and -%, or.6 is fix tenth Parts of. Unity, &amp;c.
i i. A mixt Number is always greater than Unity, as 2 4
reprefents 2 Integers, and one half of an Intege or Unity,
and 7 45, or 7.75, fignifies 7 Integers, and 75 hundred
Parts of an Integer or Unity.  
12. Accordin:t-b the Divifion of Unity,. a Fraetion
comes to be ftiled Vulgar or Dlecimal.
I3. A Vulgar Fracion is divided into two Parts, one
above another, with afmall Line drawn betwixt, of which
the lower is called the Denominator, and the higher the
Numerator, Ihewing how many of thofe Parts are fignified by the Fradiion. So if we divide Unity into 12 Parts,
5iof thofe Parts will -be exprefled thus T,i Denomia,t' anda
7 Parts thus.7,, and fo: others.
I4. A Decimal Fraction (which is the mof getuine
and natural way of dividing. Unity; and perhaps the moft
ancient) always fuppofes the Integer to be divided into Io,
ioo, rooo Parts, &amp;c.. as You covet Precifenefs i'h your

After this Method may any Number be divided, if
the Divifor be contained in your Multiplication Table,
fo T of 67-46 is s6o3', for'6 of 67is 5, of 72 is 6,
of 4 is o, of 46,is 3, reft 4.
II. Secondly, When your Divifor is an Unit, with any
Number of Cyphers annexed to the.Ri0ght-land, cut fron
your Dividend the fame Number of Places, the Remainder is the Quotient, and thofe out'of a Decimal'Fradion;
fo if. 46575 Pounds Sterling,were to be divided among:rt
loo Men, every Man's Part would'be 465 1. 15 S. if amongf Iooo Men, every Man's Part would be 46 1. I s.

II. When your Dividend and Divjfor confiif of Cyphers to the Right-hand, cut off an equal Number of
Cyphers in both, with the reft proceed as by the Rules
before given. So if 7962ooo muft be divided by 6coo,
cut off three Cyphers in both,  Part of the Reinainder
(viz.) 1327 is the Q.lotient fought.
IV. If your Divifor have Cyphers annexed, and your'Dividen.d none, cut off as many Figures in your Dividend
as there are Cyphcrs in your lDiviior, wvith the Remainder proceed as before; fo if 498565 mufte be divided by

V. If your Dividend and Divifor may be equally di.
v-ided by any Number, without leaving any Rem,ainder,
your Dividend and Divifor may be brought into leis Nulnbers. And if your Divifor dwindle to an U-nit, your laiWDividend will be the Quotient fouht. So if 672 wereto be divided by 48, your Qu otient will be i+; for eeing
they are even Numbers, I halvethem both as long as I caln.
So L of 48 is 24, of 672 is 336: Again, - of 24. is 2, of

Under this Head may be comprifed the Method of exchanging Coins, Weights and Meafures that have not
that imnmediate Reference to one another, as thofe fpoken
of before; and is of excellent Uie to moft Perfons, as
well Merchants as meaner Chapmen.
We fihall make all plain in the Work of the following
Examples.
QU E S s. I.
In 672 Nine-pences how many Thirteen-pence Halfpennies.
In this or the like Queftion, I confider how many of
one Coin are equal to any Number of the other;,, and I
find that. 3 Nine-pences are equal to 2 Thirteen-pence
Half-pennies. And which, to make my Multiplicator, I
confider whether the Anfwer, or the Number fought,
will be greater or lefs than the Number given; and accordingly I make the greater, or lefs, my Multiplicator.
So here I confider, that in 672 Nine-pences there are
lefs Thirteen-pence Half-pennies; fo the!efs Number,
to wit 2, is my Multiplicator, and 3 my Divifor.

K                      The70 Reduion by Multiplication and Divjion.
The Method how thefeDivifors and Multiplicators are
found in this and the following Queitions, is thus; bring
both your. Coins, Weights, Meafures, &amp;c. into their leaft
equal known Parts, which may be brought into lefier, by
dividing them both by fome known Divifor; or'by taking, or 3, &amp;c. as oft as you can.
So in   gd. are        36 Farthings.
And in I3 ~ are      54 l'arthings.
Say } of 36 in x8, of 54is 27 3
of8 is is6, of27 is9, of 6 is2, of  3618 6 2
9 is 3; fo are 2 and 3 the Numbers
fought.                                54;27 9 3
T'he other Numbers are Multiplicators and Divifors,
as well as thefe two, but thefe being the leaft, are moft'fit for Ufe.
