EXERCISES IN ARTICULATION.

This Exercise and similar ones will afford valuable aid in
training the organs to a distinct articulation.

Every vice ﬁghts against nature.

Folly is never pleased with itself.

Pride, not nature, craves much.

Thelittle tattler tittered at the tempest.

Titus takes the petulent out-casts.

The covetous partner is destitute of fortune.

N 0 one of you knows where the shoe pinches.
What can not be cured must be endured.

You can not catch old birds with chaff.

Never sport with the opinions of others.

The lightnings ﬂashed, the thunders roared.
His hand in mine was fondly clasped.

They cultivated shrubs and plants.

He selected his texts with great care,

His lips grow restless, and his smile is curled half into scorn.
VVisdom’s ways are ways of pleasantness.

Oh! breeze that waftst me on my way.

Thou boast’st of what should be thy shame.
Life’s ﬁtful fever over, he rests well.

Canst thou ﬁll his skin with barbed irons?
From star to star the living lightnings ﬂash.
And glittering crowns of prostrate seraphim.
That morning, thou that slu7nberd’st not before.
Habitual evils change not on a sudden.

Thou waft’d’st the rickety sktfs over the cliﬁs.
Thou reef ’d’st the haggled shipwrecked sails.
The honest shepherd’s catarrh.

The heiress in her dishabille is humorous.

The brave chevalier behaves like a conservative.
The luscious notion of champagne and precious sugar.

of all his duties, he had acquired the good will and
esteem of all who knew him, and the conﬁdence of’ the
minister of ﬁnance, Whose duty it is to inspect the
accounts of all oﬁcers connected with the revenue.

5. On casting up his accounts at the close of a par-
ticular year’, he found a deﬁcit’ of ten thousand +ducats‘.
Alarmed at this discovery’, he went to the minister,
presented his accounts, and informed him that he did

not know how it had arisen, and that he had been robbed T

by someperson bent on his ruin‘ .

6. The minister received his accounts, but thinking
it a duty to secure a person who might probably be a
defaulter, he caused him to be arrested, and put his
accounts into the hands of one of his secretaries for
ﬁnspection, who returned them the day after with the
information that the “Fdeﬁciency arose from 3. +miscalcu-
lation ; that in multiplying, Mr. Lange had said, once one
is two, instead of, once one is one.

7. The poor man was immediately. released from
+conﬁnement, his accounts returned, and the mistake
pointed out. During his imprisonment, which lasted
two days, he had neither eaten, drank, nor taken any
repose; and when he appeared, his countenance was as
pale as death. On receiving his accounts, he was a long
time silent; then suddenly awaking as if from a +trance,

, he repeated, “once one is two.”

8. He appeared to be entirely insensible of his situa-
tion; would neither eat nor drink, unless +solicited; and
took notice of nothing that passed around him. While
repeating his accustomed phrase, if any one corrected
him by saying, “once one is one,-” his attention was
‘arrested for a moment, and he said, “ah, right, once
one is one;” and then resuming his walk, he continued
to repeat, “once one is two.” He died shortly after the
traveler left Berlin.

9. This affecting story, whether true’ or untrue‘,
iobviously abounds with lessons of instruction‘. Alas‘!
how easily is the human mind thrown off its balance‘;
especially when it is stayed on this world only——and has

HENRY 1, king of England, Who commenced his reign
A. D. 1100, had a son called William, a brave and noble-
minded youth, Who had arrived at his eighteenth year.
The king loved him most tenderly, and took care to
have him *recognized as his successor by the states of

104 NEW FIFTH READER.

England, and carried him over to Normandy, in the
northof France, to receive the homage of thebarons of
that duchy. On the prince’s return, the vessel in which
he +embarked was ‘Fwrecked. He was placed in a boat
and might have escaped, had he not been called back by
the cries of his sister. He ‘!”prevailed on the sailors to
row back and take her in; but no sooner had the boat
approachedithe wreck, than numbers who had been left,

jumped into it, and the whole were drowned. King T

Henry, when he heard of the death of his son, fainted

away, and from that moment, he never smiled again.

1. The bark that held the prince went down,
The sweeping waves rolled on‘;
And what was England’s glorious crown
. To him that wept a son?
He’ lived‘-——for life may long be borne’,
Ere sorrow breaks its chain‘; -
Still comes not death to those who mourn;
He never smiled again!

2. There stood proud forms before his throne,

The “tstately and the brave;

But which could ﬁll the place of one‘?
That one beneath the wave.

But seas dashed o’er his son’s bright hair;

1. IN the city of Bath, not many years since, lived a
barber whomade a ‘*practice of following his ordinary

106 NEW FIFTH READER.

+occupation on the Lord’s day. As he was pursuing his
morning’s employment, he happened to look into some
place of worship, just as the minister was giving out his
text, “ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”
He listened long enough to be ‘*convinced that he was
constantly breaking the laws of God and man, by shav-
ing and dressing his customers on the Lord’s day. He
became uneasy and went with a heavy heart to his Sab-
bath task.

2. At length he took courage, and opened his mind to S

his minister, who advised him to give up Sabbath dress-
ing, and worship God. He replied, that ibeggary would
be the ““consequence. He had a ﬂourishing trade, but it
would almost all be lost. At length, after many a sleep—-
less night spent in weeping and praying, he was deter-
mined to cast all his care upon God, as the more he

‘ reﬂected, the more his duty became apparent‘.

3. He discontinued Sabbath dressing, went constantly

_ and early to the public +services of religion, and soon

enjoyed that ‘satisfaction of mind which is one of the
rewards of doing our duty, and that peace which
the world can neither give nor take away. The conse-
quences he foresaw, actually followed. His genteel cus-
tomers left him, and he was nicknamed a Puritan‘, or
Methodist‘. He was obliged to give up his fashionable
shop, and, in the course of years, became so reduced’, as

to take a cellar under the old market-house, and shave '

the common peopl.e‘. .

4. One Saturday evening, between light and dark, a
stranger from one of the coaches, asking for a barber,
was directed by the ihostler to the cellar opposite.
Coming in hastily, he requested to be shaved quickly,
while they changed horses, as he did not like to violate
the Sabbath. This was touching the barber on a tender
cord. He burst into tears; asked the stranger to lend
him a half-penny to buy a candle, as it was not. light
enough to shave him with safety. He did‘ so, revolving
in his mind the “textreme poverty to which the poor man
must be reduced.

5. When shaved, he said, “There must be something

ECLECTIC SERIES.   107

+eXtraordinary in your history, which I have not now
time to hear. Here is half a crown for you. When I
return, I will ca.ll and investigate your case. What is
your name‘?” “William R.eed‘,” said the astonished
barber. “VVilliam Reed?” echoed the stranger: “ VVilliam
Reed’? by your dialect you are from the West‘.” “ Yes,
sir, from Kingston, near Taunton.” “VVilliam Reed’,
from Kingston’, near Taunton’? VVhat was your fa-
ther’s‘ name?” “Thomas‘.” “ Had he any brother?”

“Yes, sir, one, after Whom I was named ; but he Went to I

the Indies, and, as We never heard from him, We sup-
posed him to be dead.”

6. “Come along‘, follow me‘,” said the stranger, “I
am going to see a person who says his‘ name is William

Reed, of Kingston, near Taunton. Come‘ and ”Vconfront‘g,

him. If you prove to be indeed he who you say you
are’, I have glorious news for you. Your uncle is dead,
and has left an ‘timmense fortune, Which I Will put you
in possession of, when all ’'legal doubts are removed.”

7. They Went by the coach‘ ; saw the “tpretended Wil-
liam Reed’, and proved him to be an +impostor. The
stranger, who was a pious attorney’, was soon +legally
satisﬁed of the barber’s identity, and told him that he
had +advertised him in vain. ‘Trovidence had now
thrown him in his Way in a most +eXtraordinary man--
ner, and he had. great pleas-ure in "ttransferring a great
many thousand pounds to a Worthy man, the rightful
heir of the property. Thus Was man’s extremity’, God’s
opportunity‘. Had the poor barber possessed one half‘-,
penny‘, or even h-ad credit for a candle‘, he might have
remained unknown for years‘ ; but he trusted God, Who
never said, “ Seek ye my face” in vain.

QUEs'rIoNs.~What excited the barber’s attention on the subject of
keeping the Sabbath? What did he do? What was the effect upon
his business? What circumstance led to his becoming acquainted
With the fact that he was heir to a large property? Who evidently
brought about all these things ?

Explain the inflections marked in the 5th, 6th, and 7th paragraphs.

THE GOODNESS OF GOD.

PRONOUNCE correctly. Do not say Lawd for Lord; Gawd for
God; cov-erst for cov-er-est; cur-tane for cur-tain (pro. cur-tin);
clzam-bars for cham-bers.

1. BLESS the Lord, Oh my soul! Oh Lord, my God!
thou art very great; thou art clothed with ‘honor and
majesty: Who coverest thyself with light as with a gar-
ment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a ‘lcurtain;
who layeth the beams of his chambers in the Waters;

who maketh the clouds his +chariot; Who Walketh upon v

the Wings of the Wind; Who maketh his angels spirits;
his ministers a ﬂaming ﬁre; who laid the ‘foundations
of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.

2. Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a gar-
ment: the Waters stood above the mountains. At thy
+rebuke' they ﬂed; at the voice of thypthunder they
hasted away.’ They go up by the mountains; they go
down by the "‘valleys unto the place which thou hast
founded for them._ Thou hast set a bound that they may
not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the
earth.

3. He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which
run among the hills. They give drink to every beast of
the ﬁeld; the Wild asses quench their thirst. By them
shall the fovvls of’ the heaven have their +habitation,
which sing among the branches. He Watereth the hills
from his chambers; the earth is ‘lsatisﬁed with the fruit
of thy Works.

ECLECTIC SERIES. 109

4. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and

herb for the service of men, that he may bring forth ,

fruit out of the earth; and wine that maketh glad the
heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and
bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.

5. The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the +cedars
of Lebanon, which he hath planted, where the birds
make their nests: as for the stork, the ﬁr-trees are her
house. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats,
and the rocks for the comes.

6. He appointeth the moon for--+seasons; the sun
knoweth his going down. Thou makest darkness, and
it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep
forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek
their meat from God. The sun ariseth, they gather
themselves together, and lay them down in their +dens.
Man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labor until
the evening.

7. Oh Lord, how manifold are thy works! in Wisdom
hast thou made them all: the earth is fullof thy riches.
So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creep-

ing innumerable, both small and great beasts. There-

go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
made to play therein. These wait all upon thee, that
thou mayest give them their meat in due season. 
8. That thou givestthem they gather; thou openes
thine hand, theyare ﬁlled with good. Thou hidest thy
face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath,

they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth -

thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face
of the earth.

9. The glory of the Lord shall +endure for ever: the
Lord shall rejoice in his +Works. He looketh on the
earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they
smoke.

10. Oh that men would praise the Lord for his'good—
ness, and for his wonderful works to the children of
men! And let them sacriﬁce the +sacriﬁces of +thanks-
giving, and declare his works with frejoicing.

110 NEW FIFTH READER.

11. Oh give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his
name; make known his deeds among the people. Sing
unto him, sing psalms unto him : tal.k ye of all his i‘won—
drous Works. Glory ye in his holy name : let the heart
of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord, and
his strength ; seek his face ‘revermore.

12. Remember his +marvelous works that he hath
done; his wonders, and the judgment of his mouth.

He is the Lord our God; his {judgments are in all the ,

earth. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I
will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

springs? By the trees? By the sun and moon ?, What should all
this teach us?

REMARK 1.-—Very full EXERCISES and‘I)IREc'_rIoNs for
practice in ARTICULATION, may be found in the New Eclectic
Third and Fourth Readers of this series, to which it is sup-
posed the reader has already paid some attention. In every
reading lesson, this subject should receive its appropriate
attention. Between the lessons in this book, also, are ex-
amples, constituting a series of exercises upon diﬂicult combi-
nations and upon vowel sounds, which, it is believed, will be
found of great utility, and to which the learner is directed for
practice.-

REMARK 2.———The teacher will recollect that, in correcting
a fault, there is always ilanger of erring in the opposite ex-
treme. Now, properly speaking, there is no danger of learning
to articulate too d2°stz'7zctZ3/, but there is danger of contracting a
habit of drawling, and of pronouncing unimportant words with
too much prominence. This should be carefully guarded

against. It is a childish fault, but is not always conﬁned to
children.

III. INFLECTIONS.

INFLECTIONS are slides of the voice upward or down-
ward. Of these there are two: the rising inﬂection and
falling inﬂection. R R

THE RISING INFLECTION is that in which the voice
slides upward, and is marked thus (’); as,

‘I
Did you walk’? (Did you 4419;’

THE FALLING INFLECTION is that in which the voice

slides downward, and is marked thus (‘) ; as,

P»

And she felt, for a time, at a loss to know

4. But to give reproof of a nobler sort

Than the angry look ’, or keen retort’;

At length, she said, in a gentle tone:

“Since it has happened that I am thrown
From the lighter element, where I grew,

And beside a +personage so “"august’,
Abased, Iwill cover my head in dust‘,

And quickly retire from the sight of one
Whom time‘, nor season‘, nor storm‘, nor sun‘,
Nor the gentle dew‘, nor the grinding heel’,

That the pride of the forest was folded up
In the narrow space of its little cup‘!
And meekly to sink in the ““darksome earth,
Which proves that nothing could hide its worth!

6. “And oh! how many will tread on me,
To come and admire the beautiful tree,
Whose head is ttowering toward the sky,
Above such a worthless thing as I‘!

1. A GENTLEMAN who possessed an estate worth
about ﬁve hundred a year, in the eastern part of
England, had two sons. The eldest being of a ‘tram-
bling disposition, Went abroad. After several years, his
father died; When the younger son, destroying his will,

seized upon the estate. He gave out that his elder .

ECLECTIC SERIES. 119

brother was dead, and +bribed false witnesses to attest
the truth of it.

2. In the course of time, the elder brother returned;
but came home in ‘destitute circumstances. His
younger brother repulsed him with scorn, and told him
that he was an +impostor and a cheat. He asserted that
his real brother was dead long ago ; and he could bring
witnesses to prove it. The poor fellow, having neither,

money nor friends, was in a sad situation. He went’

round the parish making complaints, and, at last, to a
lawyer, who, when he had heard the poor man’s story,
replied, “You have nothing to give me. If I undertake
your cause and lose’ it, it will bring me into +disgrace,
as all the wealth and +evidence are on your brother’s
side. .

3. “However, I will undertake it on this condition;
you shall enter into an +obligation to pay me one thou-
sand guineas, if I gain the estate for you. If I lose’ it,
I know the consequences‘; and I venture with my eyes
opcn‘.” Accordingly, he entered an action against the

younger brother, which was to be tried at the next gen- A

eral assizes at Chelmsford, in Essex.

4. The lawyer, having engaged in the cause of the
young .man, and being Tstimulated by the prospect of
a thousand guineas, set his wits to work to contrive the
best method to gain his end. At last, he hit upon this
happy thought, that he would consult the ﬁrst judge of

his age, Lord Chief Justice Hale. Accordingly, he has-

tened up to London, and laid open the cause, and all its
circumstances. The judge’, who was a great lover of
justice’, heard the case attentively, and promised him
all the assistance in his power‘. A

5. The lawyer having taken leave, the judge con-
trived matters so as to ﬁnish all his business at the
King’s Bench, before the assizes began at Chelmsford.
VVhen within a short distance of the place, he dismissed
his man and horses, and sought a single house. He
found one occupied by a miller. After some conversa-
tion, and making himself quite agreeable, he proposed
to the miller to change clothes‘. with him. a As the judge

120 NEW FIFTH READER.

had a very good’ suit on, the man had no reason to
object.

6. Accordingly, the Judge shifted from top to toe,
and put on a complete suit of the miller’s best. Armed
with a miller’s hat, and shoes, and stick, he walked to
Chelmsford, and “lprocured good lodgings, suitable for

the assizes, that should come on next day. When the '

trials came on, he Walked like an ignorant country

fellow, backward and forward along the county hall-

He observed narrowly what passed around‘ him ; and
when the court began to iﬁll’, he found out the poor
fellow who was the plaintiff‘.

7. _As soon as he came into the hall, the miller drew
up to him. “Honest friend’,”, said he, “how is your
cause like to go‘ to-day?” “Why, my cause is in a very
precarious situation, and, if I lose it, I am rui_ned for
life.” “VVell, honest friend’,” replied the miller, “will

b you take my advice’? I will let you into a secret‘,

which perhaps you do not /mow‘ ; every Englishman has
the right and privilege to except against any one jury-
man out of the whole twelve; now do you insist upon
your +privilege, without giving a reason, and, if
possible, get me chosen in his room, and I will doyou
all the service in my power.” A

8. Accordingly, when the clerk had called over the A

names of the jurymen, the plaintiff excepted to one of
them. The judge on the bench was highly offended at
this liberty. “What do you mean,” said he, “by ex-
cepting against thru‘/gentleman?” “I mean, my lord,
to assert my privilege as an Englishman, without giving

_ a reason why.”

9. The judge, who had been highly bribed, in order to
conceal it by a show of candor, and having a iconﬁdence
in the ‘tsuperiority of his party, said, “Well, sir’, as
you claim your privilege in one’ instance, I will grant‘
it. Whom would you wish to have in the room of that
man excepted?” After a short time, taken in +conside-

ration, “My lord, says he, “I wish to have an honest"

man chosen in,” and looking round the court——“niy

lord’, there is that m2'lle7"‘ in the court; We will have
him‘, if you please.” Accordingly, the miller was
chosen in. '

10. As soon as the clerk of the court had given them
all their oaths, a dextrous little fellow came into the
apartment, and slipped ten golden guineas into the
hands of eleven jurymen, and gave the miller l '1 ﬁve.
He observed that they were all bribed as Well as him-
self, and said to his next neighbor, in a soft Whisper,
“How much have you‘ got?” ' “Ten pieces‘/’ said he.
But he concealed What he had got himself. The cause
Was opened by the plaintiff’s counsel; and all the scraps
of evidence they could pick up were adduced in his
favor. ,

11. The younger brother Was provided With a great
number of Witnesses and pleaders, all plentifully bribed,
as Well as the judge. The Witnesses deposed, that they
Were in ‘the self-same country When the brother died,
and saw him buried. The counselors pleaded upon
this Jfaccumulated +evidence ; and every thing Went with
a full tide in favor of the younger brother. The judge
summed up the evidence with great gravity and. delibe-
ration; “and now, gentlemen of the jury’,” saidhe,
“lay your heads together, and bring in your verdict as
you shall deem most just.” i

12. They Waited but for a few minutes, before they

“determined in favor of the younger brother. The judge

said, “Grentlemen’, are you agreed? and Who shall
speak‘ for you?” “We are all agreed, my lord’,”
replied one, “ and our foreman‘ shall speak for us.”
“Hold‘, my lord’,” replied the miller; We are not‘ all
agreed.” “VVhy‘?” said the judge, in a very surly
manner, “What’s the matter with you‘? ” What rea-
sons have you‘ for disagreeing?” .

13._“I have several reasons, my lord,” replied the
miller: “the ﬁrst is, they have given to all these gentle-
men of the jury ten’ broad pieces of gold, and to me but
five‘; Which, you know, is not fair. Besides, I have
many objections to make to the false reasonings of the

pleaders, and the *contradictory evidence of the wit-
nesses.” Upon this, the miller began a discourse, which
discovered such a vast penetration of judgment, such
+eXtensive knowledge of law, and was expressed with
such manly and energetic eloquence, that it astonished
the judge and the whole court. ,

14. As he was going on with his powerful demonstra-
tions, the judge, in great surprise, stopped him. “VVhere

did you come from, and who are you?” “ I came from

VVestminster Hall,” replied the miller; “my name is
Matthew Hale; I am Lord Chief Justice of the King’s
Bench. I h.ave observed the “tiniquity of your proceed-
ings this day; therefore, come down from a seat which
you are not worthy to hold. You are one of the cor-
rupt parties in this iniquitous business. I will come up
this moment and try the cause all over again.” 1
15. Accordingly, Sir Matthewwent up, with his mil—
ler’s dress and hat on, began the trial from its very
commencement, and searched every circumstance of
truth and falsehood. He evinced the elder brother’s
title to the estate, from the contradictory evidence of
the witnesses, and the false reasoning of the pleaders;
*unrave1ed all the sophistry to the very bottom,’ and
gained a complete victory in favor of truth and justice.

QUEs'r1oNs.—What ‘Were the circumstances, under which the
younger brother took possession of his father’s estate? How did he
treat his elder brother upon his return? What did the elder brother
do? What plan did Chief Justice Hale pursue? What inﬂuenced

him to take all this trouble?

CONTROL YOUR TEMPER.

PRoNoUNcE correctly and ARTICULATE distinctly. Do not say
nat-ter-ml-lg nor nat’7*’l-lay for nat-u-ral-ly; cul-"(fer nor cult—‘ts7z.m~
for cul-tuire (pro. cult-yur); spe-cial-ly for es-pecial-ly; dc-7'€ing’d
for de-ranged; definmce for def-er-ence ; gov-mas for gov-erns;
wivndewblzine for win-dow-blind ; u-.9/ml for u-su-al.

1. No ONE has a temper naturally so good, thatit does
not need attention and cultivation, and no one has a
temper so bad, but that, by proper culture, it may
become pleasant. One of the best disciplined tempers
ever seen, was that of a gentleman who was naturally
quick, irritable, rash, and violent; but, by having the
care of the sick, and especially of +deranged people, he
so completely mastered himself, that he was never
known to be thrown oﬁ’ his guard.

2. The difference in the happiness which is received
or bestowed by the man who governs his temper, and
that by the man who does not, is immense. There is no
misery so constant, so distressing, and so +intolerable to
others, as that of having a disposition, which is your
master, and which is coiitiiiually fretting itself. There
are corners enough, at every turn in life, against which
we may run, and at which we may break out in +impa-
tience, if we choose. .

3. Look at Roger Sherman‘, who rose, from a humble
occupation, to a seat in the ﬁrst Congress of the United
States, and whose judgment was received with great def-
erence by that body of distinguished men. He made

124 NEW FIFTH READER’.

himself master of his temper, and +cultivated it as a
great bﬂusiness in life. There are one or two instances
which show this part of his character in a light that is
beautiful.

4. One day, after having received his highest honors,’

he was sitting and reading in his parlor. A “Froguish
student, in a room close by, held a looking—glass in such
a position, as to pour the reﬂected rays of the sun di-

rectly in Mr. Sherman’s face. He moved his chai_r, and V

the thing was repeated. A third time the chair was
moved, but the looking-glass still ‘Freﬂected the sun in
his eyes. He laid aside his book, went to the window,
and many witnesses of the +impudence expected to hear
the ungentlemanly student severely reprimanded. He
raised the Window gently, and then——sliut the window-
blind!

5. I can not forbear +adducing another instance of the
power he had iacquired over himself. He was naturally
possessed of strong passions; but over these he at length
obtained an extraordinary control. He became +habi-tu-
ally calm, +sedate, and self—possessed. Mr. Sherman was
one of those men who are not ashamed to ‘’“maintain the
forms of religion in their families. One morning, he
called them all together, as usual, to lead them in prayer
to God‘ ; the “ old family Bible” was brought out, and
laid on the table.

6. Mr. Sherman took his seat, and placed beside him
one of his children, a child of his old age‘; the rest of
the family were seated around the room; several of
these were nowgrown up. Beside these, some of the
tutors of thecollege were boarders in the family, and
were present at the time alluded to. His aged and su-
perannuated mother occupied a corner of the room, op-
posite the place where the ‘’distinguished judge‘ sat.

7. At length, he opened the Bible, and began to read.
The child who was seated beside him, made some little
“Fdisturbance, upon which Mr. Sherman paused, and told
it to be still. Again he proceeded‘; but again he paused,
to reprimand the little offender’, whose playful disposi-

ECLECTIC SERIES. 125

tion would scarcely permit it to be still‘. . And this time,
he gently tapped its ear. The blow, if ' blow it might be
called, caught the attention of his aged mother, Who
now, with some eifort, rose from the seat, and tottered
across the room. At length, she reached the chair of
Mr. Sherman, and, in a moment, most unexpectedly to
him, she. gave him a blow on the ear with all the force
she could isummon. “There‘,” said she, “you strike

 your’ child, and I will strike mine‘.”

8. For a moment, the blood Was seen mounting to the
face of Mr. Sherman; but it was only‘ for a moment,
When all was calm and mild as usual. He paused‘ ; he
raised his spectacles‘ ; be cast his eye upon his mother‘;

again it fell upon the book’ from which he had been I

reading‘. Not a Word escaped him; but again he calmly
pursued the service, and soon after, sought, in prayer,
an +ability to set an +example before his household,
which should be Worthy of their +imitation. Such a
victory Was worth more, than the proudest one ever
achieved on the ﬁeld of battle.

QUEs'rIoNs.—Has any one a temper so bad that it can not be gov-
erned and made pleasant? How can this be done? To Whom does a.
bad temper give most pain? Is it a duty to control it? Repeat the
two anecdotes related of Judge Sherman.

Give the rules for the inflections marked in this lesson.

The morn has just looked out, and smiled,

Vfhen he starts from his humble +grassy nest,

And is up and away with the dew on his breast,
And a hymn in his heart, to yon pure bright sphere,
To ‘Fwarble it out in his Maker’s ear.

Ever, my child’, be thy morn’s ﬁrst lays, ,
Tuned, like the 1ark’s, to thy Maker’s praisef T

2. What is that‘, mother’?
The dove‘, my son.

And that low, sweet voice, like a widow’s moan,
Is ﬂowing out from her gentle breast,
‘*Constant and pure by that lonely nest,

As the wave is poured from some crystal ‘turn,
For her distant dear one’s quick return.

Ever, my son’, be thou like the dove;

In +friendship as faithful, as constant in love.

.3. What is that‘, mother’?-
The eagle‘, my boy,
Proudly careering in his course of joy;
Firm, in his own mountain +vigor +relying‘;

Breasting the dark storm‘; the red bolt‘ “rdefying ;
His wingon the wind, and his eye on the sun,

He swerves not a hair, but bears onward, right on‘.
Boy, may the eagle’s ﬂight ever be thine ;

Onward and upward, and true to the line.”

4.. What is that‘, mother’?-,
The swan, my love.
He is +ﬂoating down from his native grove;
No loved one, now, no nestling nigh;
He is ﬂoating down by himself, to die.
Death darkens his eye, and unplumes his wings,
Yet his sweetest song is the last he sings.
Live so, my love, that when death shall come,
+Swan-like and sweet it may waft thee home.

1. DAVID numbered the people that were with him,
and set captains of thousands and captains of hun-
dreds over them. And David sent forth a third part of’
the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part

128 I NEW FIFTH READER.

under the hand of Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s
brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai, the
Gittite.   ‘a

2. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go
forth with youpmyself also. But the people answered,
thou shalt not go forth ; for if we ﬂee away, they will
not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care
for us ; but now thou art worth ten thousand of us;

therefore now it is better that thou succor us out of the .

city. And the king said unto them, What seemeth you
best, I will do. _

~ 3. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the
people came out by hundreds and by thousands. And
the king commanded Joab, and Abishai, and Ittai, say-
ing, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even
with Absalom. I And all the people heard when the king

I gave all the captains charge iconccrning Absalom.

4.. So the people went out into the ﬁeld against Israel ;
and the battle was in the wood of +Ephrai1n; where the
people of Israel were slain before the servants of David,
and there was there a great +slaughter that day of
twenty thousand men. For the battle was there scat-
tered over the face of all the country: and the wood
devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

5. And Absalom met the servants of David. And Aba

salom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the '

thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold
of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven
and the earth; and the mule that was under him went
away. A

6. And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said,
Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. And Joab
said unto the man that told him, And behold, thou
sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to
the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of
silver and a igirdle. And the man said unto Joab,
Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in
my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against
the king’s son: for, in our hearing, the king charged
thee, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Beware that none

ECLECTIC SERIES. 129

touch the young man Absalom. Otherwise, I should
have "wrought falsehood against mine own life; for
there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself
wouldst have set thyself against me. I

7. Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee.
And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them
through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in
the midst of the oak. And ten young men that bare

.Ioab’s armor, compassed about and smote Absalom, and‘

slew him. And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people
returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back
the people.

8. And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great
pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones
upon him; and all Israel ﬂed, every one to his tent.
Now Absalom, in his lifetime, had taken and ireared up
for himself a pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he
said, I have no son to keep my name in ‘Fremembrance;
and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is
called unto this day, Absalom’s Place.

9. Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now
run, and bear the king ‘Ftidings, how that the Lord hath
avenged him of his +enemies. And Joab said unto him,
Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear
tidings another day: but this day thou shaltbear no
tidings, because the king’s son is dead. Then said Joab
to Cushi, Go, tellthe king what thou hast seen. And
Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

10. Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to
Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after
Cushi. And Joab said, VVherefore wilt thou run, my
son, seeing that thou hast no ltidings ready? But how-
soever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, run.
Then Ahimaaz ran by the Wayof the plain, and overrun
Cushi. I

11. "And, David sat between the two gates; and the
watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the
wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, a
man running alone. And the +watchman cried, and

told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there
is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew
near.

12. Andthe watchman saw another man running, and
the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold,
another man running alone. And the king said, He
also bringeth tidings. And the watchman said, +Me-
thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running

of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is ,

a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
13. And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All

A is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face

before the king, and said, Blessed be the Lord thy God,
which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their
hand against my lord the king. And the king said, Is
the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered,

When Joab sent the king’s servant, and me thy servant,

I saw a great +tumult, but I knew not what it was.
And the king said unto him, Turn aside and stand here.
And he turned aside, and stood still.

14. And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings
my lord the king; for the Lord hath +avenged thee this
day of all them that rose up against thee. And the king
said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and
all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that
young man is.

15. And the king was much moved‘, and went up to
the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went,
thus he said, Oh my son Absalom’! my son’, my son Ab-
salom‘! would to God I had died for thee‘, Oh Absalom’,
my son, my son‘! l

INFLECTIONS. 15

REMARK.—Parts of a sentence" often make complete sense
in themselves, and in this case, unless qualiﬁed or restrained
by the succeeding clause, or unless the .contrary is indicated
by some other principle, the falling inﬂection takes place,
according to the rule.

EXAMPLES.

Truth is Wonderful‘, even more so than ﬁction‘. .

Men generally die as they live‘, and by their actions We must
judge of their character‘. ”

By industry We obtain Wealth‘, and persevering exertion will sel-
dom be unrevvarded‘.

Except-i072..——VVhen a sentence concludes with a negative
clause, or with a contrast or comparison, (called also antithesis),
the ﬁrst member of which requires the falling inﬂection, it
must close with the rising inﬂection. (See Rule XI, and
§2, Note.)

EXAMPLES.
No one desires to be thought a fool’ ,
I come to bury‘ Caesar, not to praise’ him.
If we care not for others‘, we ought at least to respect ourselves’.
He lives in England‘, not in France’.

REMARK.—In bearing testimony to the general character

of a man We say,

He is too honorable’ to be guilty of a vile‘ act.
But if he is accused of some act of baseness, a contrast is at
once instituted between his character and the speciﬁed act,
and We change the inﬂections, and say,

, He is too honomble‘ to be guilty of such’ an act.

A man may say, in general terms, , I
I am too busy’ for projects‘.

‘But if he is urged to embark in some particular enterprise,

he will change the inﬂections, and say,

I am too busy‘ for projects’.

QUESTIONS.-—Where, besides at the close of a sentence, may the
sense be complete? What inﬂection must be used in this case? Give
an example. What is antithesis? What is the substance of the
remark? Explain the examples.

4. He prayed for Israel‘; and his voice went up’
Strongly and fervently. He prayed for those

For his estranged, imisgzzided Absalom,

The proud, bright being, who had burst away,
In all his princely beauty, to defy

The heart that cherished him,'for him he poured,
In agony that would not be controlled, I
Strong supplication, and forgave him there,
Before his God, for his deep sinfulnesse.

5. The pall was settled. He who slept beneath
Was straightened for the grave ; and, as the folds
Sunk to the still proportions, they betrayed
The matchless symmetry of Absalom.

His hair was yet unshorn, and silken curls
Were ﬂoating round the +tassels as they swayed
To the admitted air, as glossy now,

As when, in hours of gentle dallianoe, bathing

Till the last “techo died; then, throwing off
The sackcloth from his brow, and laying back
Tl1e +pall from the still features of his child,
He" bowed his head upon him, and broke forth
In the resistless eloquence of woe:

“Alas ! my noble boy, that thou shouldst die !
Thou, who wert made so beautifully fair I
That death should settle in thy glorious eye,
And leave his stillness in this +clustering hair!
How could he mark thee for the silent tomb,
My proud boy, Absalom !.

“ Gold is thy brow, my son, and I am chill,
As to my bosom‘I have tried. to press thee.
How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill,
Like a rich harpstring, ‘yearning to caress thee,
And hear thy sweet “my father” from these dumb
And cold lips, Absalom!

. ,“The grave hath won thee. I shall hear the gush

Of music, and the Voices of the young:
And life will pass me in its mantling blush,
And the dark “!‘tresses to the soft winds ﬂung,
But thou no more, with thy sweet voice, shalt come
To meet me, Absalom!

“And, oh! when I am stricken, and my heart,
Like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken,
How will its love for thee, as I depart,
+Yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token!
It were so sweet, amid death’s gathering gloom,
To see thee, Absalom!

“And now, farewell! ’Tis hard to give thee up,
With death, so like a gentle ‘slumber, on thee.
And thy dark sin! Oh! I could drink the cup,
If from this woe its ‘tbitterness had won thee.
May God have called thee, like a +wanderer, home,

A look of melting tenderness, he clasped

He rose up ‘*calmly, and ’'composed the pall
Firmly and decently, and left him there,
As if his rest had been a breathing sleep.

in this lesson: frequently, rambling, recline, listlessly, rippling,
branches, abstracted, middle, inscrutable, creaking, cruel, relaps’d,
traps, commingled, grudges, scratch, indispensable, privileges,
giggle, crack, rattlesnake, inaccessible, composedly.

1. I FREQUENTLY spend a morning in the country,
‘trambling alone in the melancholy woods; sometimes
resting myself against the bark of a time-worn tree;
sometimes lingering on the woody hights, looking far

ECLECTIC SERIES. 135

over the surrounding World. At other times, I recline
listlessly by the side of some clear brook, over Whose
rippling Way the branches meet, and form nature’s
choicest canopy.

2. Here I indulge my memory and imagination in a
thousand devious Wanderings. I recall the distant
shadows of departed time that have, by degrees, faded
almost into oblivion, and send my mind on errands to
the future. At times, I become so completely abstracted
from the scenes around, as to forget Where I am, and to
lose almost the consciousness of being. I ruminate, I
ponder, and I dream.

3. On one of these occasions, about the middle of’
the month of August, when the +dog-star rages, and all
nature sinks into a sort of luxurious repose, I had
become somewhat tired with a ramble longer than usual,
and laid myself listlessly along the margin of a little
‘ttwittering stream, that stole its Winding Way among
the deep obscurities of the Wood, +diﬁ’using coolness, and
inviting to repose.

4. Through the arched canopy of +foliage that over-
hung the little stream, I could see it coursing its Way on
each hand among“ the rocks, glittering as if by moon-
light, and disappearing after a thousand meanderings.
It is impossible——at least With me it is impossible-—to
resist the inﬂuence of such a scene. Reﬁecting beings
|ike'ourselves, sink into a sort of melancholy treverie,
under the inﬂuence of the hallowed quiet that reigns all
around.

5. As I thus lay, in +languid listlessness along the
stream, as quiet as the leaves that breathed not a Whis—
per above me, I gradually sunk into almost +uncon-
sciousness of all the World and all it holds. The little
birds sported about, careless of my presence, and the
insects pursued that incessant turmoil, which seems
never to cease, until Winter lays his icy fetters on all
nature, and drives them into their inscrutable hiding-
places.

6. There  a *''lapse in the recollection of the current

136 NEW FIFTH READER.

of my thoughts at that moment, a short period of forget-
fulness, from which I was roused by a hoarse, creaking
voice, exclaiming, “Cruel, savage monster, what does he
here?” I looked all around, and could see only a hawk
seated on the limb of a dry tree, eying me, as I fan-
cied, With a peculiar expression of hostility.

  7. In a few minutes, I again relapsed into a profound
reverie, from which I was awakened once more by a
small squeaking Whisper, “I dare say the blood-thirsty

villain has been setting traps for us.” I looked again, i

and at ﬁrst sight, could see nothing from which I sup-
posed the voice might proceed, but, at the same time,
imagined that I distinguisheda sort of confused whisper,
in which many little voices seemed ‘lcommingled.

8. My curiosity was awakened, and peering about
quietly, I found it proceeded from a collection of
animals, birds, and insects, gathered together for some
unaccountable purpose. They seemed very much ex-
cited, and withal in a great passion about something, all

. talking at once. Listening ‘”attentively, I could distin-

guish one from the other.

9. “Let us ipounce upon the tyrant, and kill him in
his sleep,” cried a bald eagle: “for he grudges me a
miserable little lamb now and then, though I do not
require one above once a week. See! Where he Wounded
me in the Wing, so that I can hardly get an honest
living, by prey.”

10. “Let me scratch his eyes out,” screamed a hawk,
“for he will not allow me peaceably to carry off a
chicken from his barnyard, though I am dying of hun-

ger,_and come in open day to claim my natural, indis-

pensable right.”

11. “Ay, ay,” barked the fox, “he interferes in the
same base manner with my privileges, though I visit his
hen roost in the night, that I may not disturb him.”

12. “Agreed,” hissed a rattlesnake, “for he won’t
let me bite him, though he knows it is my nature, and
kills me according to Scripture.” And thereupon, he
rattled his tail, curled himself in ispiral volumes, and

ening manner. I I

13. “Agreed,” said a great fat spider, which sat in his
net, surrounded by the dead bodies of half a dozen
i.nsects, “agreed, for the, bloody—minded +savage takes
delight in destroying the fruits of my honest labors, on
all occasions.”

14. “By all means,” buzzed a great blue—bottle ﬂy,
“for he will not let me tickle his nose, of a hot summer
day, though he must see with half an eye, that it gives
me inﬁnite satisfaction.”

15. “Kill him,” cried a little ant, that ran foaming
and fretting about at a furious rate, “kill him without
mercy, for he don’t mind treading me into a million of
atoms, a bit more than you do killing a ﬂy,” addressing
the spider. “The less you say about that, the better,”
whispered the spider.

16. “Odds ﬁsh!” ‘exclaimed a beautiful trout, that I
should like very much to have caught, popping his head
out of the brook, “Odds ﬁsh! kill the monster by all
means; hook him, I say, for he +entices me with worms,
and devours me to gratify his ‘insatiable appetite.”

17. “ To be sure,” said a worm, “kill him as he sleeps,
and I’ll eat him afterward; for though I am acknowl-
edged on all hands to be his brother, he impales me alive
on a hook, only for his +a1nusement.”

18. “I consent,” cooed the dove, “for he has deprived
me of my mate, and made me a +disconsolate widow.”
Upon which, she began to mourn so piteously, that the
whole assembly *sympathized in her forlorn condition.

19. “He has committed a million of murders,” cried
the spider. “He drowns all my kittens,” mewed the
cat. “He tramples upon me without mercy,” whispered
the toad, “only because "I ’m no beauty.” “He is a
treacherous, cunning villain,” barked the fox. I “He has
no more mercy than a wolf,” screamed the hawk. “He
is a bloody tyrant,” croaked the eagle. “He is the com-

mon enemy of all nature, and deserves a hundred and I

ﬁfty thousand deaths,” exclaimed they all in one voice.

20. I began to be heartily ashamed of myself, and was
casting about how I might slip away from hearing these
pleasant +reproaches; but curiosity and listlessness to-
gether kept me quiet, while they continued to ”‘discuss
the best mode of destroying the tyrant. There was, as
is usual in such cases, great “tdiversity of opinion.

21. “I ’ll bury my talons  his brain,” said the eagle.
“I ’ll tear his eyes out,” screamed the hawk. “I ’ll whip

him to death with my tail,” barked the fox. “I ’ll sting

him home,” hissed the rattlesnake. “I’ll poison him,”
said the spider. “I’l1 ﬂy—blow him,” buzzed the ﬂy.
“I’l1 drown him, if he’ll only come into my brook, so I
will,” quoth the trout.

22. “ I will drag him into my hole, and do his business
there, I warrant,” said the ant; and thereupon there
Was a giggle among the whole set. “And I’ll——-I’ll”-—--
said the worm. “What will you do, you poor Satan?”
exclaimed the rest in a titter. “ What will I do? Why,
I’ll eat him after he’s dead,” replied sir worm ; and then
he strutted about, until he *unwarily came so near that
he slipped into the brook, and was snapped up in a
moment by the «trout.

23. The example was +contagious. “ Oh, ho! youare
for that sport,” mewed the cat, and clawed the trout be-
fore he could get his head under water. “Tit for tat,”
barked Reynard, and snatching pussy in his teeth, was
off like ashot. “Since ’t is the fashion,” said the spider,
“ I ’ll have a crack at that same blue—bottle,” and there-
upon he nabbed the poor ﬂy in a twinkling. “ By your
leave,” said the toad, and snapped up the spider in less
than no time. “You ugly thief of the world,” hissed
the rattlesnake in great wrath, and ﬁndignantly laying
hold of the toad, managed to swallow him about half
way, where he lay in all his glory.

I 24. “ What a nice morsel for my poor fatherless ones,”
cooed the dove, and pecking at the ant, was just ﬂying

should eat her.” He was carrying her oﬁ’, when the
eagle darted upon him, and soaring to his aerie on the
summit of an inaccessible rock, composedly made a meal
of both hawk and dove. Then picking his teeth with
his claws, he exclaimed with great complacency, “Wl1at
a glorious thing it isto be king of birds !”

25. “Humph,” exclaimed I, rubbing my eyes, for it
seemed I had been half sleep, “humph, a man is not so

much Worse than his neighbors, after all,” and shaking,

off the spell that was over me, bent my steps homeward,

16 INFLECTIONS.

In such cases, as the falling inﬂection is required in the
former part, by the principle of contrast and emphasis, (as will
hereafter be more fully explained), the sentence necessarily
closes with the rising inﬂeciion. I

Sometimes also, emphasis alone seems to require the rising
inﬂection on the concluding Word. See exception to Rule VII.

STRONG EMPHASIS.

RULE VII.—-Language which demands strong enzphasis
generally requires the falling inflection. -

SERIES OF WORDS OR MEMBERS.

§-3. A series of words or members, Whether in the

+splendor above the towers, pouring a ﬂood of tempered
light into every court and hall. The garden beneath
my window, is gently lighted up ; the orange and citron
trees are tipped with silver; the fountain sparkles in the
moonbeams; and even the blush of the rose is faintly
visible.~ » .

2. I have sat for hours at my window, +inhaling the
sweetness of the garden, and musing on the ‘rchcckered

features of those, Whose history is dimly shadowed out

in the elegant +memorials around. Sometimes, I have
issued forth at midnight, when every thing was quiet,
and have wandered over the whole building. Who can
do justice to a moonlight night in such a climate, and in
sucha place?

3. The ‘“temperature of an Andalusian midnight in
summer, is perfectly ethereal. We seem lifted up into a
purer atmosphere; there is a serenity of soul, a buoy
ancy of spirits, an elasticity of frame, that render mere
existence enjoyment. The effect of moonlight, too, on
the Alhambra, has something like enchantment. Every
rent and chasm of time, every ‘Fmoldering tint and

weather stain, disappears; the marble resumes its ori-

ginal whiteness; the long colonnades brighten in the
moonbeams; the halls are illuminated with a softened
radiance, until the whole -+ediﬁce reminds one of the
+enchanted palace of an Arabian tale.

4. At such a time, I have ascended to the little pavil-
ion, called the queen’s toilet, to enjoy its varied‘ and
extensive prospect. To the right, the snowy summits
of the Sierra Nevada would gleam, like silver clouds,
against the darker ﬁrmament, and all the outlines of the
mountain would be softened, yet delicately deﬁned. My
delight, however, would be‘ to -lean over the parapet of
Tecador, and gaze down upon Grenada, spread out like
a map below me, all buried in deep repose, an.d its white

_palaces and convents sleeping, as it were, in the moon-

shine.

5. Sometimes, I would hear the faint sounds of casta-
nets from some party of dancers lingering in the Ala-

meda; at other times, I have heard the +dubious notes
of a guitar, and the notes of a single voice rising from
some +solitary street, and have pictured to myself some
youthful cavalier, +serenading his lady’s window; a gal-
lant ‘custom of former days, but now sadly on the de-
cline, except in the “Fremote towns and villages of Spain.
6. Such are the scenes that have detained me for manyg‘
an hour loitering about the courts and balconies of the
castle, enjoying that mixture of reverie and ‘fsensation
which steal away existence in a southern climate, and it
has been almost morning before I have retired to my
bed, and been "lulled to sleep by the falling waters of
the fountain of Lindaraxa.

ti-tudes; or-it—uz for or-a—t0rs; in-tel-lect—ew-al for in-tel-1ect—u-al;

the nursery. There, at least, may be formed a distinct
+arti‘culation, which is t.he first requisite for good speak-
ing. How rarely is it found in. perfection among our
orators I *

2. Words, says one, referring to articulation, should
“be delivered out from the lips, as beautiful coins, newly
issued from the mint; deeply and accurately impressed,
perfectly ﬁnished; neatly struck by the proper organs,
distinct, in due “‘succession, and of due weight.” How

rarely do we hear a speaker whose tongue‘, teeth‘, and ‘

lips’, do their office so perfectly as to answer to this
beautiful description! And the common faults in artic-
ulation, it should be remembered, take their rise from
the very nursery. But let us refer to other particulars.

3. Grace in ieloquence, in the pulpit, at the bar, can
not be separftted from grace in the ordinary manners, in
private life, in the social circle, in the family. It can
not well be superinduced upon all the other acquisitions
of youth, any more than that nameless, but invaluable
quality, called good breeding. You may, therefore, begin
the work of forming the orator with your child; not
merely by teaching him to deelaim, but what is of more
+consequence, by observing and correcting his daily
manners, motions, and attitudes. _

4. You can say, when he comes into your “apartment,
or presents you with something, a book or letter, in an
awkward and blundering manner, “ Return‘, and enter
this room again‘,”' or, “Present me that book in a dif-
ferent manner"’ or, “Put yourself into a different atti-
tude‘.” You can explain to him the difference between
thrusting or pushing out his hand and arm, in straight
lines and at acute angles, and moving them in ﬂowing,
icircular lines, and easy, graceful action. He will read-
ily understand you. Nothing is more true than that
“the motions of children are foriginally graceful,” and
it is by suffering them to be perverted’, that we lay the
foundation for invincible +awkwardness in later life.

5. “Vs go, next, to the schools for children. It ought

to be a leading object, in these schools, to teach the art

\

ECLECTIC SERIES. 147

of reading. It ought to occupy three fold more time than
it does. The teachers of these schools should labor to
improve themselves. They should feel, that to them, for
a time, are committed the future +orat-ors of the land.

6. VVe would rather have a child, even of the other
sex, return to us from school a ﬁrst-rate reader, than a
ﬁrst-rate performer on the pianoforte. VVe should feel
that we had a far better pledge for the ’'intelligence and
talent‘ of our child. The accomplishment, in its per-
fection, would give more pleasure. The voice of song is
not sweeter than the voice of eloquence ; and there may
be eloquent readers’, as well as eloquent speakers‘.

7. We speak of perfection‘ in this art: and it is some-
thing, we must say in defense of our preference, which
we have never yet seen. Let the same pains be devoted
to reading, as are required to form an accomplished per-
former on an instrument; let us have, as the ancients
had, the formers of the voice, the music masters of the
reading voice; let us see years devoted tothis accom-
plishment, and then we should be prepared to stand the
“lcomparison.

8. It is, indeed, a most +intellectual accomplishment.
So is music, too, in its perfection. We do by no means
+undervalue this noble and most delightful art, to Which
Socrates applied himself, even in his old age. But one
‘*recommendation of the art of reading is, that it requires
a constant exercise of mind. It involves in its perfec-
tion, the whole art of criticism on language. A man

may possess a fine genius without being a perfect reader; '

but he can not be a perfect reader without genius.

1. THE +education, moral and +intel1ectual, of every
individual, must be, chieﬂy, his own Work. Rely upon
it, that the ancients were right ; both in morals and
intellect, we give the ﬁnal shape to our characters, and
thus become, iemphatically, the architects of our own
fortune. How else could it happen, that young men,
who have had ‘precisely the same opportunities, should

be continually presenting us With such different results, ,

and rushing to such opposite destinies?

2. Difference of talent will not solve it, because that
difference is very often in favor of the disappointed can-
didate. You Will see issuing from the Walls of the same
college, nay, sometimes from the bosom of the same
family, two young men, of Whom one Will be admitted
to be a genius of high order, the other scarcely above
the point of mediocrity; yet you Will see the genius
sinking and perishing in poverty, lobscurity, and
Wretchedness; While, on the other hand, you will ob-
serve the mediocre plodding his slow but sure Way up
the hill of life, gaining steadfast footing at every step,

tunity of instruction: but it must depend, at last, on
your.sel‘ves, whether you will be instructed or not, or to
what point you Will push your ‘instruction.

4. And of this be assured, I speak from +observation
a certain truth: THERE IS NO EXCELLENCE WITHOUT GREAT
LABOR. It is the ﬁat of fate, from which no power of
genius can absolve you.

5. Genius, unexerted, is like the poor moth that ﬂut-
ters around a candle, till it scorches itself to death. If
genius be desirable at all’, it is only of that great and
+magnanim0us kind, which, like the condor of South
America, pitches from the summit of +Ohimborazo, above
the clouds, and sustains itself at pleasure, in that em-
pyreal region, with an energy rather iinvigorated than

which are to enroll your names among the great men of

vast balance power of it, be so imbued with intelligence
and virtue as to bring out, in laws and their adn:1in.istra-

the work is a vast one, and of great difficulty; and yet
we believe it can be done. .

needs wind on a rocking sea, after a storm, to prevent
foundering. But when our fear and our efforts shall

paid the price of the purchase‘ of our liberties. It is in-
attention and z'nc0nsz'derat270n, protracted till the crisis is
past, and the things-which belong to our peace are hid
from our eyes. And blessed be God, that the tokens of
a national Waki.ng up, the harbinger of God’s mercy, are
multiplying upon us !

7. ‘Vs did not, in the darkest hour, believe that God
had brought our fathers to this goodly land to lay the

foundation of religious liberty, and Wrought such Won- r

ders in their preservation, and raised their descendants
to such hights of civil and religious liberty, only to re-
verse the analogy of his iprovidence, and abandon his
Work. '

8. And though there now be clouds, and the sea
rearing, and .men’s hearts failing, We believe there is

‘light behind the cloud, and that the imminence of our

danger is intended, under the guidance of Heaven, to
call forth and apply a holy, +fraternal fellowship be-
tween the East and the ‘Vest, which shall secure our
preservation, and make the “‘"prosperity of our nation
durable as time, and as abundant as the Waves of the
sea.

9. I would add, as amotive to immediate action, that, if
We do fail in our great ‘experiment of selfgovernnient,
our destruction Will be as signal as the birthright aban-
doned, the mercies abused, and the "tprovocation offered
to beneﬁcent Heaven. The descent of desolation will
correspond with the past elevation.

10. No punishments of Heaven a.re so severe as those
‘for mercies abused‘; and no instrumentality employed
in their infliction is so dreadful. as the Wrath of man‘.
N o spasms are like the spasms of expiring liberty, and
no ‘rvvailing such as her convulsions extort.

11. It took Rome three hundred years to die‘; a.nd
our death, if We perish, will be  much more terriﬁc, as
our intelligence and free institutions have given us more
bone, sinew, and vitality. May God hide from me the
day when the dying agonies of my country shall begin‘!

1. THERE was one modiﬁcation of her husband’s
‘tpersecutions, which the fullest measure of Jane Har-
wood’s piety could not enable her to bear unmoved.
This was unkindness to her feeble and suffering boy.
It was at ﬁrst commenced as the surest mode of ‘dis-
tressing her. It opened a direct avenue to her heart.

2. What began in +perverseness, seemed to end in
hatred, as evil habits sometimes create +perverted +prin-
ciples. The Wasted invalidshrunk from his father’s
glance and footstep, as from the approach of a foe.
More than once had he taken him from the little bed
Which maternal care had provided for him, and forced
him to go forth in the cold of the Winter storm.

3. “I mean to harden him,” said he. “All the
+neighbors know that you make such a fool of him, that
he Will never be able to get a living. For my part, I
Wish I had never been called to the trial of supporting a

156 , NEW FIFTH READER.

useless boy, who pretends to be sick only that he may
be +coaXed by a silly mother.”

4. On such occasions, it was in vain that the mother
attempted to protect her child. She could neither
shelter him in her bosom, nor control the frantic vio-
lence of the father. Harshness, and the agitation of
fear, deepened a disease which might else have yielded.
The timid boy, in terror of his natural +protector, with-
ered away like a +blighted ﬂower. It was of no avail

that friends +remonstrated with the unfeeling parent,.or-

that hoary-headed men warned him +solemnly of his
sins. Intempercmce had destroyed his respect for man,
and his fear of God.

5. Spring at length emerged from the shades of that

heavy and bitter Winter. But its smile brought no.

gladness to the declining child. '*Consumption fed
upon his vitals, and his nights were full of pain.

6. “Mother, I wish I could smell the violets that
grew upon the green bank by our dear old home.” “It
is too early for violets, my child. But the grass is beau-
tifully green around us, and the birds sing sweetly, as if
their hearts were full of praise."

7. “In my dreams last night, I saw the clear waters
of the brook that ran by the bottom of my little garden.
I wish I could taste them once more. And I heard such
music, too, as used to come from that white church
among the trees, where every Sunday thehappy people
meet to worship God”. I

8. The mother knew that the hectic fever had been
long increasing, and saw there was such an unearthly
brightness in his eye, that she feared his ‘Fintellect wan-
dered. She seated herself on his low bed, and bent over
him to soothe and compose him. He lay silent for some
time. '

9. “Do you think my father will come?” Dreading
the +ag.onizing tagitation which, in his paroxysms of
coughing and pain, he evinced at the sound of his
father’s well—known footstep, she answered, ‘_‘I think
not, love. You had better try to sleep.”

ECLECTIC SERIES. 157

10. “Mother, I Wish he Would come. I do not feel
afraid now. Perhaps he Would let me lay my cheek to
his once more, as he used to do when I was a babe in
my grandmother’s arms. I should be glad to say good-
by to him before I go to my Savior.”

11. Grazing *"intently in his face’, she saw the Work of
the destroyer, in lines too plain to be mistaken. “My
son, my dear son, say,—Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”
“Mother,” he replied, with a sweet smile upon his

ghastly features, “he is ready. I desire to go to him.’

Hold the baby to me, that I may kiss her. That is all.
Now sing to me, and oh! Wrap me close in your arms,
for I shiver with cold.”

‘ 12. He clung, with a death grasp, to that bosom
which had long been his sole earthly +refuge. “Sing
louder, dear mother, a little louder, I can no.t hear you.”
A tremulous tone, as of a broken harp, rose above her
grief, to comfort the dying _ehild. One sigh of icy
breath was upon her cheek, as she joined it to his: one
shudder, and all Was over.

13. She held the body long in her arms, as if fondly
hoping to Warm and restore it to life with her breath.
Then she stretched it upon his bed, and kneeling beside
it, hid her face in that grief which none but mothers
feel. It Was a deep and sacredtsolitude, alone With the
dead. Nothing save the soft breathing of the sleeping
babe fell upon that solemn pause. ' '

14. Then the silence was broken by a Wail of piercing
sorrow. It ceased, and a voice arose, a voice of +sup-
plication for strength to endure, as of one “seeing Him
who is invisible.” Faith closed What was begun in
weakness. It became a prayer of thanksgiving to Him
who had released the dove-like spirit from the prison-
house of pain, that it might taste the peace and mingle
in the melody of heaven.

QUESTIONS.-—What is the subject of this piece? How did the man
treat his child? What eﬁ'ect Was, in this Way, produced on the health
of the child? Can you describe the scene of the deathbed? What

1. SHE arose from her supplication, and bent calmly
over her dead. The thin, placid features were a smile,
as when he had spoken of Jesus. ' She “‘composed the
shining looks around the-pure forehead, and gazed long
on what was to her so beautiful. Tears had vanished
from her eyes, and in their stead was an expression
almost sublime, as of one who had given an angel back
to God.

 The father entered +carelessly. She pointed to
the pallid, iimmov-able brow, “ See, he suffers no
longer.” He drew near, and looked on the dead with
surprise and sadness. A few natural tears forced their
way, and fell on the face of the ﬁrst—born, who was once
his pride. The memories of that moment were bitter.
He spoke tenderly to the emaciated mother; and she,
who a short time before was raised above the sway of
grief, wept like an infant, as those few ‘affectionate
tones touchedthe sealed fountains of other years.

3. Neighbors and friends visited them, desirous to
console their sorrow, and attended them when they com-
mitted the body to the earth. There was a shady and
secluded spot, which they had “Fconsecrated by the
burial of their few dead. Thither that whole little
colony were gathered, and, seated on the fresh grass,
listened to the holy, healing words of the ’*inspired
volume.

4. It was read by the oldest man in the colony, who
had himself often mourned. As he bent reverently over
the sacred page, there was that on his brow, which
seemed to say, “This has been my comfort in my afflic-
tion. ” Silver hairs thinly covered his temples, and his
low voice was modulated by feeling, as he read of the
+frailty of man, withering like the ﬂower of the grass,
before it groweth up; and of His majesty, in whose sight
“a thousand years are as yesterday when it is past, and
as a watch in the night.” ,

5. He selected from the words of that compassionate
One, who “gathereth the lambs with his arm, and car-
rieth them in his bosom,” who, pointing out as an exam-
ple the humility of little children, said, “Except ye be-
come as one of these, ye can not enter the kingdom of
heaven,” and who calleth all the weary and heavy laden
to come unto Him that He may give them rest.

6. The scene called forth +sympathy, even from manly
bosoms. The mother, worn with watching and weari-
ness, bowed her head down to the clay which concealed
her child. And it was observed with gratitude by that

, friendly group, that the husband supported her in his

arms, and mingled his tears with hers.

7. He returned from the funeral in much mental dis-
tress. His sins were brought to remembrance, and re-
ﬂection was misery. For many nights, sleep was dis-
turbed by visions of his neglected boy. Sometimes he
imagined that he heard him coughing from his low bed,

i and felt ‘’constrained to go to him, in a strange disposi-

tion of kindness, but his limbs were unable to obey the
dictates of his will.

8. Conscience haunted him with terrors, and many

V prayers from pious hearts arose, that he might now be

led to repentance. The +venerable man Who had read
the Bible at the burial of his boy, counseled and en-
treated him, with the earnestness of a father, to yield to
the Warning voice, and to “break off his sins by "right-
eousness, and his iniquities by turning unto the Lord.”
9. There was a change in his habits and conversation,
and his friends trusted it Would be +permanent. She,

Who, above all others, was interested in the result, spared i

no iexertion to Win him back to the Way of truth, and
soothe his heart into peace With itself, and obedience to
his Maker. ’

10. Yet was she doomed to witness the ‘full force of
grief, and of remorse for intemperance, only to see them
utterly +overtl1roWn at last. The reviving virtue, with
Whose indications she had +solaced herself, an_d even
given thanks that her beloved son had not died in vain,
Was transient as the morning dew.

11. Habits of industry, which had begun to spring
up, proved themselves to be Without root. The dead,
and his cruelty to the dead, Were alike forgotten. +Dis-
affection to the chastened being, who against hope still
hoped for his isalvation,‘ +resumed its dominion_.

12. The friends who had ‘alternately reproved and
encouraged him, were soon convinced their efforts had
been of no avail. Intemperance, “like the strong man
armed,” took possession -of a soul that lifted no cry to
God, and +girded on no Weapon to resist the destroyer.

18 INFLECTIONS.

§5. Whenwords, which naturally take the rising in-
ﬂection, become emphatic by repetition or any other
cause, they often take the falling inﬂection.

Eacception to the R’MZ6.+*WhIl€ the tendency of emphasis is
decidedly to the use of the falling inﬂection, sometimes a Word
to which the falling inﬂection naturally belongs, changes this,

_ when it is emphatic, for the rising inﬂection.

EXAMPLES.

Three thousand ducats‘: ’tis a good round sum’. _
It is useless to point out the beauties of nature to one who is blind’.

Here sum and blind, according to Rule VI, would take the
falling inﬂection, but as they are emphatic, and the object of
emphasis is to draw attention to the Word emphasized, this is
here accomplished in part by giving an unusual inﬂection.
Some speakers would give these words the circumflex, but it
would be the rising circumﬂex, so that the sound would ‘still

terminate With the rising inﬂection.

RULE VIII.——Questions which can not be answered by

yes or ,no, together with their answers, generally require

the falling inﬂection.

EXAMPLES.

VVhat has he done‘? Ans. Nothing‘.

When did he go‘? Ans. Yesterday‘.

1. Two gentlemen, brothers, called at the ofﬁce to

-take seats for the following morrrlng, in the Kilkenny

coach ; there were fortunately two inside places ‘tvacant.
The elder brother was, from his appearance, iobviously
suffering under some *oppressiVe ailment, and the other,

in rather a delicate state of health. Between the two
there happened to be not more cashthan was sufficient
to pay for one passenger; the second brother said he
would bring the fare with him in the morning and Went
away. In a short time“-after, another person came into
the ofﬁee, asked for a seat in the coach, tendered his
money, ‘insisted on the strict -rules being observed, and
was booked accordingly.

2. The next morning, an hour before day, the broth-
ers arrived. The ‘tinvalid got in, and the other, putting

down his fare was told that the place was ﬁlled by one  

who had paid his money, and who threatened that, if
refused his place, he would hire a chaise for the whole
journey to Dublin, at the expense of the coach +propri-
etors. The young man looked into the coach, and ﬁnd-
ing all seats occupied, begged, and was .stre-nuously
supported by his brother, to be admitted, even for a
stageor two, as he was not in good health, and the rain
poured down in a tremendous '*de1uge.

3. The rest of the coach company seemed to yield,
but the stiff gentleman was contrary, as will" sometimes
happen, and with his former menace silenced theragent,
(Who was leaning to the side oﬂinerey), and insisted
with increased vehemence, that the rules of the office
should be observed.’  

4. The strict person was own er of a great ﬂour-mill;
he was anything but a +jnlZy miller, but adhered lite-
rally and morosely to the principle of T “caring for no-
body,” not because “nobody cared for him,?’ but because

it was the habit of his life to‘ make every liberal thought.

t-ance, compared with that of his own mill. He ordered
the coachinan to get forward, with some further menace
if he did not. '

6., The young man, after a little altercation, took his
seat beside the guard, and L the cpachman drove off‘. It
was still dark; the rain was intense, the‘voices ceased,
and the invalid, if’ a gentle snore was any ﬁndication,
had fallen asleep. /,

7. As the coach was passing through Fox and Geese
Common, a barking cur assailed the horses, and was
apparently +rcsponded to by a low growl from the
*"interior of the ‘Vehicle. “Is there a dog in the coach?”
asked the miller, for it was yet pitch dark. Those who
were awake said they could not tell: the invalid
breathed hard and snored; in a few minutes the growl
was heard again, advancing to a sharper snarl. “Have
you got a dog in the coach?” asked the miller: “it is

contrary to all rule; the agent is at fault, a.nd shall be_

ﬁned; it shall be looked towhen the coach stops.”
  .8.7A renewed snarl and a few chopping barks from

the opposite sea‘t“w*l1erecthe invalid was placed, made

the miller certain that the dog belonged to him, and lay
behind his legs. Not wishing, however, to put out his
hand, or even his foot, to make the trial, he waited for

daylight +inipatientlv and one or two succeeding growls-

from the same quarter conﬁrmed him in this +surmise.
At length a tedious dawn gave way to the slowly in-
creasing light of a gloomy morning. The millerhad his
eye ﬁxed upon the spot, and as objects became less fen-

1. “IT snows!” cries the School-boy, “ Hurrah!” and his
shout  

Is ringing through parlor and hall,

While swift as the wing of a swallow, he ’s out,
And his playmates have answered his call;

It makes the heart leap but to witness their joy,
Proud wealth has no pleasures, I trow, _

Like the +rapture that throbs in the pulse of the boy,
As he gathers his +treasures of snow; ' .

Then lay not the trappings of gold on thine heirs,

While health, and the riches of nature, are theirs.

2. “It snows!” sighs the Imbecile, “Ah I” and his breath

While,‘ from the pale +aspect of nature in death,
He turns to the blaze of his grate;

Is Wheeled toward the life-giving ﬂame;

He dreads a chill puff of the snow-burdened air,
Lest it wither his ‘tdelicate frame ;

Oh! small is the pleasure iexistence can give,

When the fear we shall die only proves that we live!

The Wind rushes by, but its howl is unheard,
Unfelt the sharp drift in his face;

For bright through the tempest his own home appeared,
Ay, though... leagues intervened, he can see:

And hiswife with her babes at her knee;

Blest thought! how it lightens the grief—laden hour,

That those we love dearest are safe from its power!

4. “It snows!” cries the Belle, “Dear, how lucky!” and

There are visions of conquests, of *splendor, and mirth,
Floating over each drear winter’s day;

But the tintings of ’ Hope, on this storm-beaten earth,
Will melt like the snowﬂakes away:

That world has a pure "fount ne’er opened in this.

1. I HAVE often had occasion to remark the tfortitude
with which Women sustain the most “tovervvhelming re-
verses of fortune. Those disasters which break down
the spirit of a man, and prostrate him in the dust, seem
to call forth allthe energies of the softer sex, and give
such intrepidity and elevation to their character, that,
attimes, it approaches to sublimity.

2. Nothing can be more touchin:g,*than to behold a
soft and tender female, Who «had been all Weakness and

ftdependence, and alive to every trivial troughness, While

treading the prosperous paths of life, suddenly rising in

4. I Was once congratulating a friend, who had around
him a blooming family, knit together in the strongest
“affection. “ I can Wish you no better lot,” said he, with
enthusiasm’, 1‘ than to have a Wife and children. If you
are prosperous, there they are to share‘ your pros-
perity ; if otherwise‘, there they are to comfort‘ you.”

5. And, indeed, I have observed, that a married’ man,
falling into misfortune, is more apt to retrieve his situa-
tion in the World than a single‘ one; partly, because he
is more ‘stimulated to exertion by the "*“necessities of the
helpless and beloved beings Who depend upon. him for
+subsistence‘ ; but chieﬂy, because his spirits are soothed
and relieved by domestic +endearments, and his self-
respect kept alive by ﬁnding, that, though all abroad is
darkness and humiliation, yet there is still a little World
of love at home, of which he is the imonarch‘. Whereas,
a single man is apt to run to Waste and self-neglect, to
fancy himself lonely and abandoned, and his heart to
fall to ruin, like some deserted ‘fmansion, for Want of
an inhabitant. -

To endure slander and abuse with meekness’, requires no ordi-
nary degree of self-command‘. .

As a dog returneth to his vomit’, so a fool returneth to his folly‘.

REMARK.—-The person or object addressed, comes under
this head.

EXAMPLES.

Fathers’! We once again are met in council. ,

My lords’! and gentlemen’! We have arrived at an awful crisis.

Age’! thou art shamed.

Rome’! thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!

E;cceptz'on.——-VVhere a Word, which, according to this rule,
requires the rising inflection, becomes emphatic, it generally
must have the falling inﬂeotion, according to Rule VII.

Those who mingle with the vicious, if they do not become de-
praved‘, will lose all delicacy of feeling.

So also, when a child addresses his father, he ﬁrst says, Fath-
er’! but if he repeats it emphatically, he changes “the inﬂec-
tion, and says, Father‘! Father‘! ‘

REMAR-K.—The principle of this rule will be found to apply
especially to the last pause before the close of a sentence, as
that-is generally themost interesting point of suspension. See
examples under Rule VII, §3. ,Harmony of sound, also, seems
to require the rising inﬂection at this place, even when other
reasons would indicate the contrary.

RULE X.——Questions which may be answered by yes
or no, generally require the rising, and their answers the
falling inﬂection.

QUESTIONS.-—-Of what rule is this the c nverse or opposite? Give

She was all gentleness, all gayety,

The nurse, that ancient lady, preached decorum;
And, in the luster of her youth, she gave

‘ DECISIVE INTEGRITY.

GIVE the 7* its rolling sound in the following words in this
lesson: strongest, approbation, secret, afraid, alacrity, brilliant,
right, free, erect, heroic, phrase, pride, constrain, private, scrupu-
lous, integrity, drives, morality, greatness, streamlets, presents,
torrent, purity.

1. THE man Who is so conscious of the reotitude of his
intentions, as to be Willing to open his bosom to the
inspection of the World, is in possession of one of the
strongest pillars of a decided character. The course of
such a man will be ﬁrm and steady, because he has
nothing to fear from the World, and is sure of the
lapprobation and support of heaven. While he, who is
conscious of secret and dark designs, Which, if‘ known,
would blast him, is perpetually shrinking and dodging
from public observation, and is afraid of all around, and
much more of all above him.

2. Such a man may, indeed, pursue his iniquitous
plans steadily; he may Waste himself to a skeleton in
the guilty pursuit; but it is impossible that he can
pursue them With the same health-inspiring +conﬁdence
and exulting alacrity with him Who feels, at every step,
that he is in the pursuit of honest ends, by honest means.
The clear, unclouded brow, the open countenance, the
brilliant eye, which can look an honest man steadfastly,
yet +courteously, in the face, the healthfully beating
heart, and the ﬁrm, elastic step, belong to him Whose

ECLECTIG SERIES. 175

bosom is free from guile, and Who knows that all his
purposes are pure and right.

3. VVhy should such a man falter in his course? He
may be “tslandered; he may be deserted by the World;
but he has that Within which will keep him erect, and
enable him to move onward in his course, with his eyes
fixed on heaven, which he knows will not desert him.

4. Let your first step, then, in that ‘discipline which
is to give you decision of character, be the heroic deter-
mination to be honest men, and to preserve this charac-
ter through every vicissitude of fortune, and in every
relation which connects you With society. I do not use
this phrase, “honest men,” ‘in the narrow sense merely
of meeting your +pecuniary engagements, and paying
your debts, for this the common pride of gentlemen Will
constrain you to do.

5. I use it in its larger sense of +discharging all your
duties, both public and private, both open and secret,

with the most scrupulous, +heaven—attesting integrity,

in that sense, further, which drives from the bosom all
little, dark, crooked, sordid, debasing +eonsiderations of
self, and substitutes in their place a bolder, loftier, and
nobler spirit; one that will dispose you to consider your-
selves as born, not so much for yourselves, as for your
country and your fellow-creatures, and which will lead

p you to act, on every occasion, sincerely, justly, gener-

ously, imagnanimously.

6. There is a morality on a larger scale, perfectly
consistent with a just attention to your own affairs,
which it Would be the hight of folly to neglect: a gener-
ous expansion, a proud elevation and conscious greatness
of character, which is the best preparation for a decided
course, in every situation into which you can be thrown;
and it is to this high and noble tone of character that
I would have you to ‘‘aspire.

7. I would not have you resemble those Weak and
meager streamlets, which lose their “direction at every
petty impediment which presents itself‘, and stop, and
turn back, and creep around, and search out every little

176 NEW. FIFTH READER.

"‘channel through Which they may Wind their feeble and
sickly course. Nor yet would I have you resemble the
headlong torrent‘ that carries havoc in its mad career.

8. But I would have you like the ocean, that noblest
emblem of ‘tmajestic decision, Which, in the calmest
hour, still heaves its resistless might of Waters to the
shore, ﬁlling the heavens, day and night, with the
echoes of its sublime declaration of independence, and
tossing and sporting on its bed, with an ‘rimperial
‘Fconsciousness of strength that laughs at ‘topposition.
It is this depth, and Weight, and power, and purity of
character, that I would have you to resemble; and I
would have you, like the Waters of the ocean, to become
the purer by your own action.

QUEsrIoNs.—What is said of the man who is conscious of the recti-
tude of his intentions? What of the man of the opposite description?
What is the ﬁrst step in gaining decision of character? What would
the author not have you resemble? What would he have you like?

1. THE Bible everywhere +conVeys the idea that this

life is not our home, but a state of ‘probation, that is, of  

trial and +dz'scz'plz’ne, which is intended to prepare us for
another. In order that all, even the youngest of my
readers, may understand what is meant by this, I shall
iillustrate it by some familiar examples, drawn from the
actual business of life. '

2. VVhen a large steamboat is built, with the inten-
tion of having her employed upon the waters of a great
river, she must be proved before put to service. Before
trial, it is somewhat doubtful whether she will succeed.
In the ﬁrst place, it is not absolutely certain whether
her ‘Fmachinery will Work at all. There may be some
ﬂaw in the iron, or an imperfection in some part of the
*Workmanship, which will prevent the motion of her
wheels. Or, if this is not the case, the power of the ma-

ECLECTIC SERIES. 179

chinery may not be sufficient to propel her through the
water with such force as to overcome the current; or
she may, when brought to encounter the rapids at some
narrow passage in the stream, not be able to force her
way against their resistance.

3. The engineer, therefore, resolves to try her in all

these respects, that her ‘“security and her power may be

properly proved, before she is “Fintrusted with her valua-

‘ ble cargo of human lives. He cautiously builds a ﬁre

under her boiler: he watches with eager interest the
rising of the steam-gauge, and scrutinizes every part of
the machinery, as it gradually comes under the control
of the tremendous power, which he is +apprehensively
applying.

4. With what interest does he observe the ﬁrst stroke
of the ponderous piston! and when, at length, the fas-
tenings of the boat are let go, and the motion is ‘Fcom—
municated to the wheels, and the mighty mass slowly
moves away from the wharf, how deep and eager an
interest does he feel in all her movements, and in every
indication he can discover of her future success!

5. The engine, however, works imperfectly, as every
one must on its first trial; and the object in this +experi-
ment is not to gratify idle curiosity, by seeing that she

will move, but to discover and remedy every little im- ﬂ

perfection, and to remove every obstacle which pre-
vents more entire success. For this purpose, you will
see our engineer examining, most minutely and most
attentively, every part of her complicated machinery.
The crowd on the wharf may be simply gazing on her

' majestic progress as she moves off from the shore, but

the engineer is within, looking with faithful +eXamina—
tion into all the minutim of the motion.

6. He scrutinizes the action of every lever and the
friction of every joint; here, he oils a bearing, there, he
tightens a nut: one part of the machinery has too much

, play, and he conﬁnes it; another, too much friction, and

he loosens it; now, he stops the engine, now, reverses
her motion, and again, sends the boat forward in her

180 NEW FIFTH READER.

course. He discovers, perhaps, some great impr9ve-
ment of which she is +susceptible, and when he returns
to the wharf and has extinguished her ﬁre, he orders
from the machine-shop the necessary alteration.

7 . The next day he puts his boat to the trial again,
and she glides over the water more smoothly and swif'tly
than before. The jar which he had noticed is gone, and
the friction reduced; the beams play more smoothly,

and the +alteration which he has made produces a more

equable motion in the ‘shaft, or gives greater effect to
the stroke of the paddles upon the water.

8. When at length her motion is such as to satisfy
him upon the smooth surface of the river, he turns her
course, we will imagine, toward the rapids, to see how
she will sustain a greater trial. As he increases her

steam, to give her power to overcome the new force

with which she has to contend, he watches, with eager
interest, her boiler, +inspects the gauge and safety-
valves, and, from her movements under the increased
pressure of her steam, he receives suggestions for fur-
ther improvements, or for ‘precautions which will insure
greater safety. X ‘

9. These he executes, and thus he —perhaps goes on
for many days, or even weeks, trying and examining,
for the purpose of improvement, every Working of that

. mighty power, to which he knows hundreds of lives are

soon to be intrusted. This now is probation; trial for
the sake of improvement. And what are its ‘Fresults?
Why, after this course has been thoroughly and faith-
fully apursued,ithis ﬂoating palace receives upon her
broad deck, and in her carpeted and curtained cabin,
her four or ﬁve hundred passengers, who pour along in
one long procession of happy groups, over the bridge of
planks; father,and son, mother and children, young
husband and wife, all with +implicit conﬁdence trusting
themselves and their dearest interests to her power.

10. See her as she sails away ! How beautiful and yet
how powerful are all her motions! That beam glides

up and down gently and smoothly in its +grooves, and if

ECLEC TIC SERIES. 181

yet gentle as it seems, hundreds of horses could not hold
it still; there is no apparent violence, but every move-
ment is with irresistible power. How graceful is her
form andyet how mighty is the momentum With which
she presses on her way I

11. Loaded with life, and herself the very symbol of
life and power, she seems something +ethereal, unreal,
which, ere we look again, will have vanished away.
And though she has within her bosom afurnace glowing
with furious ﬁres, and a reservoir of death, the elements
of most dreadful ruin and conﬂagration, of destruction
the most complete, and agony the most “tunutterable;
and though her strength is equal to the united energy
of two thousand men, she restrains_ it all.

12. She was +constructed by genius, and has been tried

and improved by ﬁdelity and skill; and one man gov-A

erns and controls her, stops her and sets her in motion,
turns her this way and that, as easily and certainly as
the child guides the gentle lamb. She walks over the
one hundred and sixty miles of her -route, without rest
and without ‘fatigue; and the passengers, who have
slept in safety in their berths, with destruction by water
without, and by ﬁre within, defended only by a plank
from the one, and by a sheet of copper from the other,
land, at the appointed time, in safety. i

13. My reader, you have within you susceptibilities
and powers, of which you have little present conception;
energies, which are hereafter to operate in producing
fullness of enjoyment or horrors of suffering, of which

, you now can form scarcely a conjecture. You are now

on trial. God wishes you to prepare yourself for safe
and happy action. He wishes you to look within, to ex-
amine the complicated movements of your hearts, to
detect what is wrong, to *‘modify what needs change,
and to ‘‘rectify every irregular motion.

14. You go out to try your moral powers upon the
stream of active life, and then return to retirement, to
improve what is right, and ‘Fremedy what is wrong.
Renewed opportunities of moral practice are given you,

LUCY FORRESTER.

1. LUCY was only six years old, but bold as a fairy;
she had gone by herself a thousand times about the
braes, and often upon errands to houses two or three
miles distant. What had her parents to fear? The foot-
paths were all ﬁrm, and led to no places of danger, nor
are infants themselves +incautious when alone in their
pastimes. Lucy went singing into the low woods, and
singing she re-appeared on the open hillside. VVith
her small white hand on the rail, she glided along the
wooden bridge, or, tripped from stone to stone across
the shallow streamlet.

2. The creature would be away for. hours, and no fear
be felt on her account by any one at home ; whether she
had gone, with her basket under her arm, to borrow
some article of ‘‘‘household use from a neighbor, or
merely for her own +solitary delight, had wandered off

185

to the braes to play among the ﬂowers, coming back la.-
den with +wreaths and garlands.

ECLECTIC SERIES.

3. The happy child had been invited to pass a whole
day, from morning to night, at Ladyside (a farm—house
about two miles off), with her playmates, the Maynes;
and she left home about an hour after sunrise.

4. During her absence, the house was silent but

happy, and, the evening being now far advanced, Lucy
Was expected home every minute, and Michael, Agnes,
and Isabel, her father, mother, and aunt, went to meet
her on the way. They walked on and on, wondering a
little, but in no degree talarmed, till they reached Lady-
side, and heard the cheerful din of the children within,
still rioting at the close of the holiday. Jacob Mayne
came to the door, but, on their kindly asking why Lucy
had not been sent home before daylight was over, he
looked painfully surprised, and said that she had not
been at Ladyside.

5. Withiii two hours, a hundred people were +travers-
ing the hills in all directions, even to a distance which
it seemed most unlikely that poor Lucy could have
reached. The shepherds and their dogs, all the night
through, searched every +nook, every stony and rocky
place, every piece of taller heather, every +crevice that
could conceal any thing alive or dead, but no Lucy was
there. i

6. Her mother, who, for a while, seemed ‘tinspired
with supernatural strength, had joined in the search,

and, with a quaking heart, looked into every brake, or _

» stopped and listened to every shout and halloo reverber-

ating among the hills, intent to seize upon some tone of
+recognition or discovery. But the moon sank; and
then the stars, whose increased brightness had, for a
short time, supplied her place, all faded away; and then
came the gray dawn of the morning, and then the clear
brightness of the day, and still Michael and Agnes were

‘ childless.

7. “She has sunk into some mossy or miry place,”

said Michael to a man near him, into whose face he could

186 NEW FIFTH READER.

not look, “a cruel, cruel death to one like her! The
earth on which my child walked has closed over her,
and we shall never see her more ! ”

8. At last a man who had left the search, and gone
in a direction toward the high—road, came running,
with something in his arms toward the place where
Michael and others were standing beside Agnes, who
lay, +apparently exhausted almost to dying, on the

sward. He approached +hesitatingly; and Michael saw.

that he carried Lucy’s bonnet, clothes and plaid.

9. It was impossible not to see some spots of blood
upon the ‘tfrill that the child had worn around her neck.
“ Murdered ! murdered I ” was the one word, whi’spered
or ejaculated all around; but Agnes heard it not: for,
worn out by that long night of hope and despair, she
had fallen asleep, and was perhaps seeking her lost

Lucy in her dreams.

10. Isabel took the clothes, and narrowly tinspecting
them with eye and hand, said, with a ‘fervent voice, that
was heard even in Michael’s despair, “ No, Lucy is yet
among the living. There are no marks of violence on
the garments of the innocent, no murderer’s hand has
been here. These blood-spots have been put there to
deceive. Beside, would not the murderer have carried
off these things? For what else would he have mur-
dered her ? But, oh! foolish “tdespairl What speak I
‘of? For wicked as the world is——ay! desperately wicked

¥'—there is not, on all the surface of the wide earth, a

hand that would murder our child! Is it not plain as
the sun in the heaven, that Lucy has been stolen by
some wretched gipsy beggar.”

11. The crowd quietly ‘Fdispersed, and horse and foot
began to scour the country. Some took the high-roads,
others all the by-paths, and many the trackless hills.
Now that they were in some measure ‘“relieved from the
horrible belief that.the child was dead, the worst other
calamity seemed nothing, for hope brought her back to
their arms.

12. Agnes had been able to walk home to Bracken-
Braes, and Michael and Isabel sat by her bedside. All

her strength was gone, and she lay at the mercy of the
rustle of a leaf, or a shadow across the window. Thus
hour after hour passed, till it was again twilight. “I
hear footsteps coming up the brae,” said -Agnes, who
had for some time appeared to be slumbering; and in a
few moments, the voice of Jacob Mayne was heard at
the outer—door. F  A n _

13. Jacob wore a solemn expression of countenance;
and he seemed, from his looks, to bring no comfort.
Michael stood up between him and his wife, and looked
into his heart. Some thing there seemed to be in his

I face that was not +miserable. “If he has heard nothing

of my child,” thought Michael, “this man must care
little for his own ﬁreside.” “Oh, speak, speak,” said
Agnes; “yet why need you speak? All this has been

I but a vain belief, and_ Lucy is in heaven.”

14. “Some thing like a +trace of her has been discov-
ered; a woman, with a child, that did not look like a
child of hers, was last night at Clovenford, and left it at
the dawning.” “Do you hear that, my beloved Agnes?”
said Isabel; “she will have +tramped away with Lucy
up into Ettrick or Yarrow; but hundreds of eyes will
have been upon her; for these are quiet, but not solitary
glens; and the hunt will be over long before she has
crossed down upon Hawick. I knew that country in
my young days. What say you, Mr. Mayne? There is
the light of hope in your face.” “There is no reason to
doubt, ma’am, that it was Lucy. Every body is sure of
it. If it was my own Rachel, I should have no fear as
to seeing her this blessed night.”

15. Jacob Mayne now took a chair, and sat down,
with even a smile upon his countenance. “I may tell
you now, that Watty Oliver knows it was your child, for

he saw her +li'mping along after the gipsy at Galla-«

Brigg; but having no +suspicion, he did not take a
second look at her——but one look is +sufﬁcient———and he
swears it was bonny Lucy Forrester.”

16. Aunt Isabel, by this time, had bread and cheese,
and a bottle of her own e1der—ﬂower wine, on‘ the table.

188 NEW FIFTH READER.

“You have been a long and hard journey, where ever
you have been, Mr. Mayne; take some refreshment,”
and Michael asked a blessing.

17. Jacob saw that he might now Ventureto ‘‘reveal
the whole truth. “No, no, Mrs. Irving, I am over
happy to eat or to drink. You are all prepared for the
blessing that awaits you. Your child is not far off ; and
I myself, for it is I myself that found her, will bring her
by the hand, and restore her to her parents.”

18. Agnes had raised herself up in her bed at these
words, but she sank gently back on her pillow; aunt
Isabel was rooted to her chair; and Michael, as he rose
up, felt as if the ground were sinking under his feet.
There Was a dead silence all around the house for a
short space, and then the sound of many voices, which
again by degrees +subsided. The eyes of all then
looked, and yet feared to look toward the door.

19. Jacob Mayne was not so good as his word, for he
did not bring Lucy by the hand to +restore her to her
parents; but dressed again in her own bonnet and gown,
and her own plaid, in rushed their own child by herself,
with tears and sobs of joy, and her father laid her within
her mother’s bosom.

His own again?” “Nay, Rabbi, come, behold
These ‘priceless jewels ere I yield them back.”

 

So to their spousal chamber, with soft hand

Her lord she led. There, on a snow white couch
Lay his two sons, pale, pale, and motionless,

Like fair twin lilies, which some ‘grazing kid

In iwantonness had cropped. “My sons! my sons!
Light of my eyes! ” the astonished father cried;
“My teachers in the law! whose iguileless hearts
And prompt obedience warned me oft to be

More perfect with my God I ”

To earth he fell,

Like Lebanon’s rent cedar ; while his breast
Heaved with such groans as when the laboring soul
Breaks from its clay companion’s close embrace.
The mourning mother turned away and wept,
Till the ﬁrst storm of ‘‘passionate grief was still.
Then, pressing to his ear her faded lip,

She sighed in tone of tremulous tenderness,

“ Thou didst instruct me, Rabbi, how to yield

The summoned jewels. See! the Lord doth give,
The Lord hath taken away.”

“ Yea I” said the sire,

“And blessed be his name. Even for thy sake,
Thrice blessed be Jehovah.” Long he pressed

On those cold, beautiful brows his ‘quivering lip,
When from his eye the burning anguish rolled ;
Then kneeling low, those chastened spirits poured
Their mighty homage forth to God.

“Outvenoms all the Worms of Nile.”

1. WHO has notheard of the rattlesnake or *copper-
head? An unexpected sight of either of these reptiles
will make even the lords of creation recoil; but there is
a species of Worm, found in various parts of this State,

which conveys a poison of a nature so deadly, that, com-

pared With it, even the '*venom oflthe rattlesnake is
harmless. To guard our readers against this foe of
human kind, is the object of this lesson.

2. This Worm varies much in size. It is frequently an
inch in +diameter, but, as it is rarely seen, except when
coiled, its length can hardly be +eonjectured. It is of a
dull lead color, and generally lives near a spring or
small stream of Water, and bites the unfortunate people,
who are in the habit of going there to drink. The brute
creation it never molests. They avoid it With the same
instinct, that teaches the animals of Peru to shun the
deadly coya.

3. Several of these reptiles have long infested our set-
tlements, to the +misery and destruction of many of our
fellow-citizens. I have, therefore, had frequentopportu-
nities of being the melancholy spectator of the effects

IECLECTIC SERIESQ‘ 193

produced by the subtile poison which this worm ‘tin-
fuses.

4. The ‘'symptoms of its bite are terrible. 'The eyes
of the patient become red and ﬁery, his tongue swells to
an immoderate size, and obstructs his “iutteranceg and
“Fdelirium of the most horrid  quickly follows.
Sometimes, in his madness, he attei1npt‘sthee destruction
of his nearest friends. ' ,_   * i

5. If the sufferer has a family, his weeping wife and
helpless infants are not unﬁequently the objects of his
frantic fury. In a word, he iexhibits, to the life, all the
detestable passions that rankle in the bosom of a savage;
and such is the spell in which his senses are looked, that,
no sooner has the ‘“unhappy patient recovered from the
"'paroXysm of insanity, occasioned by the bite, than he
seeks out the destroyer, for the sole purpose of being
bitten again. i

6. I have seen a good old father, his locks as white as
snow, his step slow and trembling, beg in vainof his
only son to quit the ilurking place of the worm. My
heart bled when he turned away ; for I knew the fond
hope, that his son would be the “staff of his ‘Fdeclining
years,” had supported him through many a sorrow.

7. Youths of America, would you know the name of 4

this reptile? It is called the Worm of the Still.

talking through its nose.)

1. NooN, by the north clock‘! Noon, by the east‘!
High noon, too, by those hot sunbeams which fall’,

scarcely aslope’, upon my head, and almost make the

water bubble and smoke in the trough under my nose‘.
Truly‘, we public characters have a tough time‘ of it!
And among all the town oﬁicers, chosen at the yearly
meeting, where is he that sustains, for a single year, the
burden of such imanifold duties as are imposed, in
‘fperpetuity, upon the Town Pump.

2. The title of town treasurer is rightfully mine, as
guardian of the best treasure the town has. The ‘over-
seers of the poor ought tomake me their chairman, since
I provide +bountifully for the pauper, without expense to
him that pays taxes. I am at the head of the ﬁre depart-
ment, and one of the physicians of the board of health.

ECLECTIC snnms. 195

As a keeper of the peace, all water-drinkers confess me
equal to the constable. I perform some of the duties of
the town clerk, by promulgating public notices, when
they are pasted on my front.

3. To speak within bounds, I am chief ‘person of the
municipality, and +eXhibit, moreover, an ‘*admirable
pattern to my brother oﬁicers, by the cool, steady,
upright, downright, and ‘impartial ‘discharge of my
business, and the constancy with which I stand to my
post. Summer or winter, nobody seeks me in vain; for
all day long I am seen at the busiest corner, just above
the market, stretching out my arms to rich and poor
alike; and at night I hold a lantern over my head, to
show whereI am, and to keep peopleout of the gutters.

4. At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the
parched populace, for whose beneﬁt an iron goblet is
chained to my waist. Like a dram-seller on the public
square, on a +muster day, I cry aloud to all and sundry,
in my plainest accents, and at the very tiptop of my
voice. Here it is‘, gentlemen’! Here is the good liq-
uor‘! VValk up‘, walk up‘, gentlemen’, walk up‘, Walk
up‘! Here is the superior stuff‘! Here is the unadul-
terated ale of father Adam‘! better than Cogniac’, Hol-
lands’, Jamaica’, strong beer’, or wine of any‘ price;
here it is, by the hogshead,*or the single glass, and not
a cent to pay! Walk up, gentlemen, walk up, and help
yourselves !

5. It were a pity, if all this outcry should draw no
customers. Here they come. A hot day, gentlemen.
+Quaﬁ‘ and away again, so as to keep yourselves in a
nice, cool sweat. You, my friend, will need another

cupful to wash the dust out of your throat, if it be as I

thick there as it is on your cowhide shoes. I see that
you have trudged half a score of miles to-day, and, like
a wise man, have passed by the taverns, and stopped at
the running brooks and wellcurbs. Otherwise, betwixt
heatwithout and fire within, you would have been
burnt to a cinder, or melted down to nothing at all, in
the fashion of a ‘jellyﬁsh.

6. Drink, and make room for that other fellow, who
seeks my aid to quench the ﬁery fever of last night’s
potations, which he drained from no cup of mine. Wel-
come, most rubicund sir! You and I have been stran-
gers hitherto; -nor, to confess the truth, will my nose be
anxious for a closer +intimacy, till the fumes of your
breath be a little less *potent. W  

7. Mercy on you, man! The water absolutely hisses

down your red-hot "Pgullet, and is converted quite into,

steam in the ‘!'miniature +Tophet, which you mistake for
a stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the word of an
honest toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any
other kind of dramshop, spend the price of your chil-
dren’s- food for a swig half so delicious? Now, for the
ﬁrst time these ten years, you know the ﬂavor of cold
water. Good-by ; and whenever you are thirsty, recol-
lect that I keep a constant supply, at the old stand.

8. Who next? Oh, my little friend, you are just let
loose from school, and come hither to scrub your bloom-
ing face, and drown the memory of certain taps of the
ferule, and other school-boy troubles, in a +draught from
the Town Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your
young life; take it, and may your heart and tongue
never be scorched with a ﬁercer thirst than now.

9. There, my dear child, put down the cup, and yield
your place to this elderly gentleman, who treads so ten-
derly over the pavin.g—stones, that I suspect he is afraid
of breaking them. What! he limps by, without so
much as thanking me, as if my "hospitable offers were
meant only for people who have no wine-cellars}.

10. iWell, well, sir, no harm done, I hope! Go, draw
the cork, tip the +decanter; but when your great toe
shall set you a roaring, it will be no affair of mine. If
gentlemen love the pleasant titillation of the gout, it is
all one to the Town Pump. This thirsty dog, with his
red tongue "tlolling out, does not scorn my ihospitality,
but stands on his hind legs, and laps eagerly out of the
trough. See, how lightly he ‘tcapers away again! Jew-
ler, did your worship ever have the gout?

11. Your pardon‘, good people’! I must interrupt
my stream of teloquence, and spout forth a stream of
water, to “*replenish the trough for this teamster and his
two yoke of oxen, who have come all the way from
Staunton, or somewhere along that way. N 0 part of
my business gives me more pleasure than the ‘watering
of cattle. Look‘! how rapidly they lower the water-
mark on the sides of the trough, till their +capacious
stomachs are moistened with a gallon or two apiece, and
they can afford time to breathe, with sighs of calm
enjoyment. Now they roll their quiet eyes around the
brim of their monstrous drinking vessel. An ox is your
true toper.  

12. I ‘hold myself the grand ‘freformer of the age.
From my spout, and such spouts as mine, must ﬂow the
stream that shall cleanse our earth of a vast portion of
its crime and anguish, which has gushed from the ﬁery
fountains of the still. In this mighty ‘enterprise, the
cow shall be my great confederate. Milk and water!

13. Ahem! Dry work, this “Fspeechifying, especially
to all unpracticed orators. I never conceived, till now,
what toil the temperance lecturers undergo for my sake.
Do, some kind Christian, pump a stroke or two, just to
wet my whistle. Thank you, sir. But to proceed.

14. The Town Pump and the Cow! Such is the glori-
ous partnership, that shall ﬁnally monopolize the whole
business of quenching thirst. Blessed consummation!
Then, Poverty shall pass away from the land, ﬁnding no
hovel so wretched, where her squalid form may shelter

. itself. Then, Disease, for lack of other victims, shall

gnaw his own heart and die. Then, Sin, if she do not’
die, shall lose half her strength. i

15. Then, there will be no war of households. The
husband and the wife, drinking deep of peaceful joy, a
calm bliss of temperate affections, shall pass hand in
hand through life, and lie down, not reluctantly, at

‘ its protracted close. To them, the past will be no tur-

moil of mad dreams, nor the future an eternity of such
moments as follow the delirium of the drunkard. Their

dead faces shall express what their spirits were, and are
to be, by a lingering smile of memory and hope.

16. Drink, then, and be refreshed! The water is as
pure and cold as when it slaked the thirst of the red
hunter, and ﬂowed beneath the aged bough, though now
this gem of the wilderness is treasured under these hot
stones, where no shadow falls, but from the brick build-
ings. But, still is this ifountain the source of health,

peace, a.nd happiness, and I behold with certainty and  

joy, the approach of the period, when the virtues of
cold water, too little valued since our father’s days, will

. be fully +appreciated and ’“recognized by all.

  (HRCUMFLEX. A

THE circumﬂex is a union of the rising and falling in-
ﬂections upon the same sound. Properly speaking, there
are two of these, the one called the rising circumﬂex, in
which the voice slides down and then up ; and the other,
the falling circumﬂex, in which the voice slides ujaward

and then downward on the same vowel. They may both,

be denoted by the same mark; thus (A). The circumﬂ-
ﬂex ispused chieﬂy to indicate the emphasis of irony, or
of contrast, or of hypothesis.

EFFECTS or GAMBLING.

REMARK.--Be careful to observe the commas and other points,

making an appropriate pause at each one of them.

1. THE love of gambling steals, perhaps, more often
than any other sin, with an imperceptible inﬂuence on
its victim. Its ﬁrst ipretext is ﬁnconsiderable, and
falsely termed innocent play, with no more than the
gentle iexcitement necessary to amusement. This plea,
once indulged, is but too often “as the letting out of
water.” The interest imperceptibly grows. Pride of
superior skill, opportunity, avarice, and all the ‘lover-
whelming passions of depraved nature, ally themselves
with the incipient and growing fondness. Dam and
dike are swept away. The victim struggles in vain, and
is borne down by the +uncontrolled current.

2. Thousands have given scope to the ‘“latent guilty
avarice, unconscious of the guest they harbored in their
bosoms. Thousands have exulted over the avails of
gambling, without comprehending the baseness of using

the money of another, won without honest industry,

ECLECTIC SERIES. 205

obtained without an +equivalent: and perhaps from the

4 Tsimplicity, rashness, and +ineXperience of youth. Mul-

titudes have commenced gambling, thinking only to ‘win
a small sum, and prove their superior skill and dexterity,
and there pause. ’

3. But it is the teaching of all time, it is the expe-
rience of human nature, that effectual "resistance to
powerful propensities, if made at all, is usually made

before the ‘commission of the ﬁrst sin. My dear reader! ,

let me implore you, by the mercies of God and the worth
of your soul, tolcontemplate this enormous evil only
from a distance. Stand ﬁrmly against the ﬁrst tempta-
tion, under whatsoever +specious forms it may assail
you. “Touch not.” “Handle not.” “Enter not into
temptation.” i .

4. It is the "‘melancholy and well known character
of this sin, that, where once an appetite for it has gained
possession of the breast, the common motives, the gentle
excitements, and the ordinary ‘linducements to business
or amusement, are no longer felt. It incorporates itself
with the whole body of thought, and ﬁlls with its fascin-
ation all the desires of the heart. Nothing can hence-
forwardl arouse the spell-bound victim to a ’“pleasurable
‘‘consciousness of existence, but the destructive stimulus
of gambling.

5. Another +appalling view of gambling is, that it is
the proliﬁc stem, the fruitful parent, of all other vices. Blas-
phemy, falsehood, cheating, drunkenness, quarreling,
and murder, are all naturally connected with gambling;
and what has been said, with so much power and truth,
of another sin, may, with equal emphasis and truth, be
asserted of this: “Allow yourself to become a lconﬁrmed
gambler; and detestable as this practice is, it will soon
be only one among many gross sins of which you will be
guilty.” Giving yourself up to the indulgence of another
sinful course, might prove your ruin; but then you
might perish only under the guilt of the ‘indulgence of
a single gross sin.

6. But, should you become‘ a gambler, you will, in all

206 NEW FIFTH READER.

probability, descend to destruction with the added in-
famy of having been the slave of -all kinds of iniquity,
and “led captive by Satan at his will.” Gambling seizes
hold of all the passions, allies itself with all the appetites,
and compels every propensity to pay ’“tribute. The
subject, however plausible in his external deportment,
becomes Tavaricious, greedy, +insatiable. Meditations
upon the card table occupy all his day and night dreams.
Had he the power, he would tannihilate all the hours of
this our short life, that necessarily +intervene between
the periods of his favorite pursuit.

7. Cheating is a sure and +inseparable attendant upon
a continued course of gambling. We well know with
what horror the canons of the card table repel this
charge. It pains us to assert our deep and deliberate
conviction of its truth. There must be prostration of
moral principle, and silence of conscience, even to begin
with it. Surely a man who regards the natural sense of
right, laying the +obligations of Christianity out of the
question, can not sit down with the purpose to win the
money of another in this way.

8. He must be aware, in doing it, that avarice and
dishonest thoughts, it may be almost "’“unconsciously to
himself, mingle with his motives. Having once closed
his eyes upon the unworthiness of his motives, and de-
ceived himself, he begins to study how he may deceive
others. Every moralist has remarked upon the delicacy
of conscience; and that, from the ﬁrst +violation, it be-
comes more and more callous, until ﬁnally it sleeps a
sleep as ,of death, and ceases to tremonstrate.

9. The gambler is less and less scrupulous about the
modes of winning, so that he can win. No person will
be long near the gambling table of high stakes, be the
standing of the players what it may, without hearing the
charge of CHEATING bandied back and forward; or read-
ing the +indignant expression of it in theiricountenances.
One half of our fatal duels have their immediate or
remote origin in insinuations of this sort.

10. The alternations of loss and gain; the +prcterna-

EGLECTIC SERIES. 207

tural excitement of the mind, and consequent depression
When that excitement has passed away; the bacchana-
lian merriment of guilty associates; the loss of natural
rest; in short, the very ’*atmosphere of the gambling
table, foster the temperament of hard drinking. A keen
sense of interest may, indeed, and often does, restrain
the gambler, while actually engaged in his employment,
that he may possess the ‘requisite coolness to watch

his ‘antagonist, and avail himself of every passing ,

advantage.

11. But the moment the high excitement of play is in-
termitted, the moment the passions ivibrate back to the
state of repose, what shall sustain the sinking spirits;
what shall renerve the relaxed physical nature; what
shall fortify the mind against the tortures of conscience,
and the thoughts of “a judgment to come,” but +intoxi-
cation? It is the experience of all time, that a person is
seldom a gambler for any considerable period, Without
being also a drunkard. ‘

12. Blasphemy follows, as athing of course: and is,
indeed, the well—known, and universal dialect of the
gambler. How ‘often has my heart sank within me, as
I have passed the dark and dire. receptacles of the gam-
bler, and seen the red and bloated faces, and iinhaled
the mingled smells of tobacco and ‘“potent drink; and
heard the loud, strange, and horrid curses of the players;
realizing the while, that these beings so occupied were
*candidates' for eternity, and now on the course which,
if not speedily forsaken, would ﬁx them forever in hell.

13. We have already said, that gambling naturally
leads to guarreling and murder. How often have we
retired to our berth in the steamboat, and heard charges
of dishonesty, accents of +reviling and 'l‘recrimination,

and hints that these charges must be met and settled at 1

another time and place, ring in our ears, as we have
been attempting to commune with God, and settle in a
right frame to repose! Many '*‘corses of young men,
who met a violent death from this cause, have we seen
carried to their long home! Every gambler, in the

region Where We Write, is always armed to the teeth,
and goes to this horrid pursuit, as the gladiator formerly
presented himself on the arena of combat.

14. The picture receives deeper shades, if We take into
the grouping the wife, or the daughter, or the mother, who
lies sleepless, and ruminating through the long night,

trembling lest her midnight +retirement shall be invaded

by those Who bring back the husband and the father
Wounded or slain, in one of those sudden ifrays Which
the card table, its accompaniments, and the passions it
excites, so frequently generate. Suppose these +fore-
bodings should not be realized, and that he should steal

home alive in the morning, with beggary and drunken- 

ness, guilt and despair, Written on his +haggard counte-
nance, and accents of sullenness and ill temper falling
from his‘ tongue, how ﬁnsupportably gloomy must be
the prospects of the future to that family!

15. These are but feeble and general sketches of the

misery and ruin to individuals and to society from the
‘indulgence of this vice, during the present life. If the
Wishes of unbelief Were true, and there Were no life after
this, What perverse and miserable +calculations Would be
those of A the gambler, taking into view only the present
World! But, in any view of the character and conse-
quences of gambling, Who shall dare close his eyes upon

a its future bearing on the interest and the eternal welfare

of his soul! Who shall dare lay out of the calculation
the retributions of +eterm,'ty? f c

16. Each of the sins that enters into this deadly com-
pound of them all, must incur the threatened displeasure
and punishment of the Almighty. If there be degrees
in the misery and despair of the ”"tenants of that re-
gion, “Where the Worm dieth not, and the ﬁre is not
quenched,” how must the +persevering and ﬁmpenitent
gambler sink, as if “a millstone were hung about his
neck, and he cast into the sea I ” Say thou, my youthful
reader, I implore thee, looking up to the Lord for a ﬁrm
and unalterablef purpose, “ I will hold fast my integrity
and not let it go.”

CRIMINALITY OF DUELING.

In 1804, Alexander Hamilton was challenged by Aaron Burr. Both
Were distinguished American Statesmen, but Burr envied Hamilton’s
popularity. Hamilton felt compelled by the force of public opinion
to accept the challenge, but ﬁred his pistol in the air, and was him-

— self killed by Burr. The following is from an address by DR. N cm‘.

1. HAMILTON yielded to the force of an imperious
custom; and yielding, he '*sacriﬁced a life in which all
had an interest; and he is lost, lost to his country, lost
to his family, lost to us. For this rash act, because he
+disclaimed it, and was penitent, I forgive him. But
there are those whom I can not forgive. I mean not his
antagonist, over whose erring steps, if there be tears in
heaven, a pious mother looks down. and weeps.

2. If he be capable of feeling, he suffers, already, all
that humanity can suffer: suffers, and wherever he may
ﬂy, will suffer, with the poignant +recollection of having
taken the life of one, who was too ‘tmagnanimous in
return to attempt his own‘. If he had known this, it
must have paralyzed his arm while he pointed, at so
iincorruptible a bosom, the ‘‘instrument of death. Does
he know this now, his heart, if it be not ‘fadamant, must
soften; if it be not ice, it must melt. * >l< * But on this
article I forbear. Stained with blood as he is, if he be
penitent I forgive him; and if he be not, before these
altars, where all of us appear as +suppliants, I wish not
to excite your ivengeance, but rather, in behalf of an

INFLECTIO-NS. I 23

3. I knew when seven justices could not make up a. quarrel;
but when the parties met themselves, one of them thought but of an
tf; as, if you said so, then I said so ; Oh ho! did you say so? so
they shook hands and were sworn brothers.

REMARKS.-—-In the first example the emphasis is that of
contrast. The queen had poisoned her husband, of Which she
incorrectly supposed her son ignorant, and she blames him for
treating his father-in-law with disrespect. In his reply, Ham-
let contrasts her deep crime with his own slight offense, and
the circumﬂex upon you, becomes proper.

In the second example the emphasis is ironical. The Span-
iards pretended, that they véo-uld protect the Peruvians, if they
would submit to them, Whereas, it was evident, that they
merely desired to plunder and destroy them. Thus their pro-
tection ‘is ironically called snch protection as mtllures give to
ldmbs, &c.

In the third example, the Word “so” is used hypothetically,
that is, it implies a condition or supposition. It will be
observed that the rising circumﬂex is used in the ﬁrst “so,”
and the falling, in the second, because the ﬁrst ‘_‘ so ” must end
with the rising inﬂection, and the second, with the falling in-
ﬂection, according to previous rules.

 

MONOTON E.

WHEN no Word in a sentence receives an inﬂection, it
is said to be read in a monotone; that is, in nearly the

same tone throughout. This uniformity of tone is occa-

sionally adopted, and is fitted to express solemnity or

sublimity of idea, and sometimes intensity of feeling. It

is used, also, when the Whole sentence or phrase is ‘em-
phatic. In books of elocution, when it is marked at all,
it is generally marked thus (——), as in the fourth line
following.

3. But I have said, and I repeat it, there are those
Whom I can. not forgive. I can not forgive that minis-
ter at the altar, Who has hitherto forborne to ‘Fremon-
strate on this subject. I can not forgive that public
+prosecutor, Who, intrusted with the duty of avenging
his country’s Wrongs, has seen these Wrongs and taken
no measures to ‘‘avenge them. I can not forgive that
judge upon the bench, orthat governor in the chair of
State Who has lightly passed over such offenses. I I can
not forgive the public, in Whose opinion the iduelist
ﬁnds a sanctuary. I can not forgive you, my brethren,
who till this late hour have been silent, While +succes-
sive murders Were committed.

4. No; I can not forgive you, that you have not in
common with the freemen of this State, raised your
voice to the ‘powers that be, and loudly and iexplicitly
demanded an +eXecution of your laws; demanded this
in a manner, Which, if it did not reach the ear of gov-
ernment, Would at least have reached the heavens, and
have pleaded your excuse before the God that ﬁlleth
them; in Whose presence as I stand, I should not feel
myself innocent of the blood that crieth against us, had
I been silent.

5. But I have not been silent. Many of you Who
hear me are my Witnesses; the Walls of yonder temple,
Where I have heretofore addressed you, are my Wit-
nesses, hovv freely I have animadverted on this subject,
i.n the presence both of those Who have ‘'violated the
laws, and of those Whose iindispensable duty it is to see
the laws executed on those who violate them.

6. I enjoy another ‘Fopportunity; and Would-to God,
I might be permitted to approach for once the last scene
of death. Would to God, I could there assemble on the
one side, the +disconsolate mother With her seven father-
less children, -and, on the other, those who administer the
justice of my country. Could I do this, I would point
them to these sad objects.

7. I Would entreat them, by the agonies of ‘bereaved
fondness, to listen to the WidoW’s heart-felt groans; to
mark the orphan’s sighs and tears ; and having done
this, I would uncover the breathless corpse of Hamil-
ton; I Would lift from his gaping Wound his bloody
mantle; I would hold it up to heaven before them, and
I would ask, in the name of God, I Would ask, Whether
at the sight of it they felt no compunction. Ye who
have hearts of pity; ye who have experienced the ‘Fan-
guish of +dissolVing friendship; Who have wept, and
still Weep over the imoldering ruins of departed kin-
dred, ye can enter into this ireﬂection.

8. Oh thou disconsolate Widow! robbed, so cruelly
robbed, and in so short a time, both of a husband and a
son! What must be the plenitude of thy suffering!
Could We approach thee, gladly would We drop the tear
of ‘sympathy, and pour into thy bleeding bosom the
balm of ““consolation! But how could We comfort her
Whom God hath not comforted! To his throne let us
lift up our Voices and Weep. Oh God! if thou art still
the WidoW’s husband, and the father of the fatherless;
if in the fullness of thy goodness, there be yet mercy in
store for imiserable mortals, pity, oh pity this afﬂicted
mother, and grant that her hapless iorphans may ﬁnd a

1. ROME Was an ocean of ﬂame. Hight and depth
were covered with red surges, that rolled before the
blast like an endless tide. The +billows burst up the
sides of the hills,.which they turned into instant volca-
noes, exploding “lvolumes of smoke and ﬁre; then
plunged. into the depths in a hundred glowing ”'cata-
racts, then, climbed and consumed again. ‘

2. The distant sound of the city, in her convulsion,

Went to the soul. The air was ﬁlled With the steady ‘
roar of the ““advancing ﬂame,‘ the crash of falling houses,

and the +hideous outcry of the myriads, ﬂying through

the streets, or surrounded and perishing in the conﬂa-‘

gration.
3. All was clamor, Violent ‘‘struggle, and helpless
death. Men and Women of the highest rank Were on

by foot, "trampled by the rabble, that had then lost all

respect for condition. One dense mass of miserable life,
‘irresistible from its Weight, crushed by the narrow

streets, and scorched by the ﬂames over their heads,
rolled through the gates like an endless stream of black
lava.

4. The ﬁre had ‘‘originally broken out upon the Pal-
atine, and hot smoke, that wrapped and half blinded us,
hung thick as night upon the wrecks of pavilions and
palaces ; but the dexterity and knowledge of my inex-
plicable guide carried us on. ‘

5. It was in vain that I insisted upon knowing the
purpose of this terrible traverse. He pressed his hand
upon his heart in +re-‘assurance of his ﬁdelity, and still
spurred on. ‘Ne now passed under the shade of an
immense range of lofty buildings, whose gloomy and
solid strength seemed to bid +deﬁance to chance and
time. ‘

6, A sudden yell appalled me. A ring of ﬁre swept
round its summit: burning +cordage, sheets of canvas,
and a shower of all things combustible, ﬂew into the air
above our heads. An ‘uproar followed, unlike all that I
had ever heard, a hideous mixture of lhowls, shrieks,
and groans. T

7. The ﬂames rolled down the narrow street before
us, and made the passage next to ‘“impossible. VVhile
we hesitated, a huge fragment of the building heaved as
if in an earthquake, and, fortunately for us, fell inward.
The whole scene of terror was then open.

8. The great amphitheater of Statilius Taurus had
caught ﬁre; the stage, with its inﬂammable furniture,

was “‘“intensely blazing below. The ﬂames were wheeling

up, circle after circle, through the seventy thousand

seats that rose from the ground to the. roof. I stood in‘

‘runspeakable awe and wonder on the side of this +colos—
sal cavern, this mighty temple of the city of ﬁre. At
length, a descending blast cleared away the smoke that
covered the arena. .

9. The cause of those horrid cries was now visible.
The wild beasts kept for the games, had broken from
their dens. Maddened by fright and pain, lions, tigers,
panthers, Wolves, whole herds of the monsters of India

and Africa, were inclosed in an “timpassable barrier of
ﬁre.

10. They bounded, they fought, they screamed, they
tore; they ran howling round and round the circle; they
made *desperate leaps upward through the blaze; they
were ﬂung back, and fell only to fasten their fangs in
one another, and, with their parching jaws bathed in
blood, to die raging.

11. I looked tanxiously to see whether any human
being was involved in this fearful catastrophe. To my
great relief, I could see none. The keepers and attend-
ants had 1“obviously escaped. As I expressed my glad-
ness, I was startled by a loud cry from my guide, the
first sound that I had heard him utter.

12. He pointed to the opposite side of the amphithe-

ater. There indeed sat an object of +melancholy inter- I

est; a man who had been either unable to escape, or had
determined to die. Escape was now impossible. He
sat in desperate calmness on his funeral pile. He was a
‘gigantic Ethiopian slave, entirely naked.

13. He had chosen his place, as if in mockery, on the
‘Fimperial throne; the ﬁre was above him and around
him, and under this tremendous +canopy he gazed,
without the movement of a muscle, on the combat of the
wild beasts below; a solitary sovereign, with the whole

tremendous game played for himself, and inaccessible to

the power of man.

IV. ACCENT.

IN every Word which contains more than one syllable,
one of the syllables is pronounced with a somewhat
greater stress of voice, than the others. This syllable is
said to be accented. The accented syllable is distine
guished by this mark (’), the same which is used in
inﬂections.

, . EXAMPLES.

Love ’-ly, re-tu rn ’, re-m em ’-b or,
Con ’-stant, re-m ain ’, a-sun ’-der,
Mem ’-ber, ‘ a-bide ’, a-ban ’-don,
‘Vin ’-dow, a-tone’, ' rec-ol—lect’,
Ban ’-n er, a-lone ’, re—em-bark ’.

REMARK.-—In most cases, custom is the only guide for
placing the accent on one syllable rather than another. Some-
times, however, the same word is differently accented, in order
to mark its different meanings.

EXAMPLES.
Con’-jure, to practice enchantments. Con-jure’, to entreat.
Gal’-lant, brave. V Gal—lant’, a gay fellow.
Au’—gust, almonth. ' Au-gust’, grand.

REMARK.—-A number of Words, also, have their accent on

one syllable When verbs or adjectives, and on another, When"

A nouns.
EXAMPLES.
Sub’-ject, the noun; to subject’, the verb.
Pres ”—ent, ,, A to pre—sent’, ,,
Con’-duct, ,, to conduct’, ,,
0b—’ject, , ,, to object’, ' ,,

of North America’! Why‘, man’, What ‘security have
you that you will not be in their War kettlein two hours

K. 0. Because if they had possessed ‘any, they would
not have treated my +subjects so "ibarbarously as they
have done. I

P. That is no +proof of the +oontrary, friend Charles.
Thy subjects Were the aggressors. When thy subjects
first Went to North America, they found these poor
people the fondest and kindest creatures in the World.
Every day, they Would watch for them to come ashore,
and hasten to meet them, and feast them on the best ﬁsh,
and venison, and corn, which were all they had. In
return for this hospitality of the savages, as We call
them, thy subjects, termed Christians, seized on their
country and. rich hunting grounds, for farms for
themselves. Now, is it to be Wondered at, that these
much injured people should have been driven to +des-
peration by such ‘rinjustice; and that, burning With +re-
venge, they should have committed some *eXcesses?

K. 0. Well, then, I hope you Will not complain when
they come to treat you in the same manner.

P. I am not afraid of it.

K. 0. Ah! how vvill you avoid it? You mean to get
their hunting grourids too, I suppose ?

have already bought them of me.

P. Yes, I know Iahave, and at a dear rate, too: but I
did it only to get thy good Will, not that I thought thou
hadst any right to their lands.

K. 0. How‘, man’? no right to their lands?

ECLECTIC'@SERIES. 227

P. No, friend Charles, no right, no right at all: what ,

right hast thou to their lands?

K. 0. Why‘, the right of +discovery‘, to be sure; the
right which the Pope and all Christian kings have
agreed to give one another.

P. The right of discovery? A strange kind of right,
indeed. Now, suppose, friend Charles, that some “canoe
load of these Indians, crossing the sea, and ‘discovering
this island of Great Britain, were to cl.aim it as their
own, and set it up for sale over thy head, what Wouldst
thou think of it?

K. O’. Why———Why———Why—-I must confess, I should
think it a piece of great timpudenee‘ in them.

P. Well, then, how canst thou, a Christian, and a
Christian prince too, do that which thou so utterly con-
demnest in these, people, Whom thou callest savages?
Yes, friend Charles; and suppose, again, that these
Indians, on thy refusal to giveup thy island of Great
Britain, were to make war on thee, and, having Weapons
more “destructive than thine, Were to destroy many of
thy subjects, and drive the rest away,-——Wou1dst thou
not think it thorribly cruel?

K. 0. I must say, friend William, that I should; how
can I say otherwise?

P. Well, then, how can I, who call myself a Christian,
do What I should +abhor even in the heathen? N o. I
Will not do it. But I will buy the right of the proper
owners, even of the Indians themselves. By doing this,
I shall ‘timitate God himself, in his “justice and mercy,

4. Parents mourn for their children with the bitter-
ness of despair; the aged parent, the widowed mother,
loses, when she is deprived of her children, every thing
but the capacity of suffering; her heart, withered and
‘'desolate, admits no other object, +cherishes no other
hope. It is Rachel, weeping for her children, and re-
fusing to be comforted, because they are not.

5. But, to conﬁne our attention to the number of the
slain, would give us a very inadequate idea of the rav-
ages of the sword. The lot of those who perish +instan-
taneously may be 'consider,ed, apart from religious
prospects, as "comparatively happy, since they are
exempt from those lingering diseases and slow torments
to which others are so liable.

6. We can not see an, individual +expire, though a
stranger or an enemy, without being sensibly moved
and prompted by compassion to lend him every +assist~
ance in our power. Every trace of ““resentment vanishes
in a moment; every other emotion gives way to pity
and terror.

7. In the last extremities, we remember nothing but
the respect and tenderness due to our common’ nature.
What a scene, then, must a ﬁeld of battle present, where
thousands are left without assistance, and without pity,
with their wounds exposed to the ‘piercing air, while
the blood, freezing as it ﬂows, binds them to the earth,
amid the +trampling of horses, and the insults of an
+enraged "foe!

8. - If they are spared by the humanity of the enemy,

and carried from the ﬁeld, it is but a prolongation of i

+torment.' Conveyed in uneasy vehicles, often to a

and sick, where the +varie'ty of distress baffles all the
efforts of +humanity and skill, and renders it impossible
to give to each the attention he demands.

BATTLE OF WATERLOO. *

In reading the following extract, much variety of expression is
required. The description of the ball should be read in a lively,
animated manner; that of thedistant alarm in low, hurried tones, as
if intently listening and deeply anxious; the haste of preparation
and departure requires life’; and the third and last two stanzas should
be read in a mournful and plaintive style.

1. THERE was a sound of revelry by night,

*9 This battle was fought on June 18th, 1815, between the French
army on one side, commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Eng-

‘lish army and allies on the other side, commanded by the Duke of

Wellington. At the commencement of the battle, some of the ofﬁcers
were at a ball at Brussels, a short distance from Waterloo, and being
notiﬁed of the approaching contest by the cannonade. left the ballroom
for the ﬁeld of battle. This was-the last of Napoleon’s battles He
was here completely overthrown.

EMPHASIS. A 25

V. EMPHASIS.

A WORD is ‘said to be emphasized, When it is uttered
with a greater stress of voice, than the other words with
which it is connected. -

REMARK 1.-———The object of emphasis is, to attract particular
attention to the word upon which it is placed, indicating, that
the idea to be conveyed, depends very much upon that word.
This object, as just stated, is generally accomplished by in-
creasing the force of utterance, but sometimes, also, by a
change in the inﬂection, the use of the monotone, or by utter-
ing the words in a very low tone. Emphatic words are often
denoted by italics, and a still stronger emphasis by SMALL
CAPITALS or LARGE CAPITALS, according to the degree of
emphasis desired.

REMARK 2.-—-Emphasis constitutes the most important fea-
ture in reading and speaking, and, properly applied, gives life
and character to language. Accent, inflection, and, indeed,
every thing yields to emphasis.

REMARK 3.—In the following examples, it will be seen that
accent is governed by it.

EXAMPLES.

What is done, can not be undone.
There is a. difference between giving and forgiving.
He that descended is the same that ascended.

Some appear to make very little diﬁ"erenoe between decency and
indecency, morality and immorality, religion and 27rre1igion.

REMARK 4.———There is no better illustration of the nature’

and importance of emphasis, than the following examples. It"

will be observed that the ‘meaning, and proper answer of the
question vary with each change of the emphasis.

’ QUESTIONS.-—When is a word emphasized? Upon what part of the
word is the increased stress placed? W hat is the object of emphasis?

In what other way, than the one just mentioned, can this be accom- "

plished? How are emphatic words marked? What is said of the

importance of emphasis? What other things yield to. emphasis‘?

1. To be ﬁnsensible to public opinion, or to the esti-
mation in which We are held by others, indicatesany
thing, rather than a good and generous spirit. It ‘is, in-'
deed,the mark of a low and worthless character; devoid
of principle, and therefore devoid of shame. A young
man is not far from ruin, when he can say Without
blushing, I do n’t care what others think of me.

2. But to have a proper regard to public opinion, is
one thing; to make that opinion our rule of action, is
quite another. The one We may cherish +consistently
with the purest virtue, and the most unbending recti-
tude; the other We can not adopt, Without an uh er
‘abandonment of principle and disregard of duty.

3. The young man Whose great aim is to please, W110.
makes the opinion and favor of others his rule and
motive of action, stands ready to adopt any +sentiments,
or pursue? any course of conduct, however false and
‘*crimin.al,)provided only that it be popular.

1

ECLECTIC SERIES. 235

4. In every ‘emergency, his ﬁrst question is, What
Will my companions, What Will the World think and say
of me, if I adopt this or that course of conduct? Duty,
the ‘Feternal laws of rectitude, are not thought of. Cus-
tom, fashion, ipopular favor: these are the things that
ﬁll his entire vision, and decide every question of opinion
and duty. ~ 

5. Such a man can never be trusted; for he has no
‘lintegrity, and no independence of mind to obey the
dictates of rectitude. He is at the mercy of every casual
‘*impulse and change of +po'pular opinion; and you can
no more tell Whether he Will be right or Wrong to-mor-
row, than you can predict the course of the Wind, or
What shape the clouds will then assume.»

‘6. And What is the usual consequence of this Weak
and foolish regard to the opinions of men? What the
end of thus acting in ‘*compliance With custom in opposi-

. tion to one’s own conviction of duty? It is to lose the

esteem and respect of the very men Whom you thus

attempt to please. Your defect of principle and +holloW-
heartedness are easily +perceived: and though the per-

sons to Whom you thus +sacriﬁce your conscience, may
affect to commend your complaisance, you may be

’ +assured, that, inwardly, they despise you for it.

7 .' Young men hardly commit a greater mistake, than
to think of gaining '- the esteem of others, by yielding to
their Wishes contrary to theirown sense of duty. Such
conduct is always imorally Wrong, an_d rarely‘ fails to-

ftdeprive one, both of self-respect and the respect of

others. _,
8. It ‘is very common for young men, just com-

mencing business, tojmagine that, if they would advance.

their secular interests,_ they must not bevery scrupulous
in binding themselves down to the st1€§’§§;1i::,.rules of recti-
tude. They must conform to custom; and if, in buying

a and selling, they sometimes say things that are not true,

and do things that are not honest; Why, their neigh-
bors do the same; and, verily, there is no getting along

without it. There is so much competition and irivalry, ’

236 NEW FIFTH READER.

that, to be +strz'ctly honest, and yetsucceed in business, is
out of the question‘. 1
9. Now, if it were indeed so, I would say to a young
man; then, quit your business. Better dig, and beg too,
than to tamper with conscience, sin against God, and
lose your soul. ~ , " '
10. But is it so? ‘Is it necessary,’ in order to succeed
in business, that you should adopt a +standard of morals,

more lax and pliable, than the one placed before you in E

the Bible? Perhaps for a time, a rigid +adherence to
rectitude might bear hard upon you; but how would it
be in the end? Possibly, your neighbor, by being less
‘scrupulous than yourself, may invent a more +eXpedi-
tious way of acquiring a" fortune. If he is willing to
violate the dictates of conscience, to lie and cheat, and
trample on the rules of justice and honesty, he may,
indeed, get the start of you, and rise suddenly to wealth
and distinction. -

11. But would you envy him his riches, or be willing
to place yourself in his situation? Sudden Wealth,
“*especially when obtained by dishonest means, rarely
fails of bringing with it sudden ruin. Those who acquire

. it, a.re of course beggared in their morals, and are often,

very soon, beggared in property. Their riches are +cor-
rupted; and while they bring the curse of God on their
‘timmediate “tpossessors, they usually entail misery and
ruin upon their families. ,,

12. If it be admitted, then, that strict integrity is not

always the shortest way to success, is it not the surest,
the happiest, and the best? A young man of thorough
integrity may, it is true, ﬁnd itidiﬂicult, in the midst of
dishonest +competitors and rivals, to start in his business
or ”'profession;__ but how long, ere he will surmount
every  around him ’'patrons and friends,
and rise in the conﬁdence and support of all Who know
him. 1 ’ '

13. What, if, in pursuing this course, you should not,
at the close of life, have so much money, by a few hun-

dred dollars? Will not a fair character, an approving

ECLECTIC SERIES.   237

conscience, and an approving God, be an abundant com-
pensation for this little “‘deﬁciency of pelf?

14. Oh, there is an hour coming, When one Whisper of
an approving mind, one smile of anapproving God, Will
be accounted of more value than the Wealth of a thou-
sand Worlds like this. In that hour, my young friends,
nothing will sustain you but the "consciousness of
having been governed in life by Worthy and good
principles.

1. OBIDAH, the son of Abensina, left the caravansary
early in the morning, and pursued his journey through
the plains of Hindoostan. He was fresh and vigorous
with rest; he was *animated with hope; he was +incited
by desire: he Walked swiftly forward over the valleys
and saw thehills igradually rising before him.

2. As he passed along, his ears were delighted with
the morning song of the bird of paradise ; he was fanned
by the last ﬂutters of the sinking breeze, and sprinkled
with dew by groves of spices; he sometimes +contem-
plated the itowering hight of the oak, monarch of the
hills; and sometimes caught the gentle ‘fragrance of the
+primrose, eldest daughter of the spring: all his senses
were gratiﬁ nd all care was banished from his heart.
1: on,till the sun approached his +m'eri-
 easing heat preyed upon his strength ;

diouspath. He saw, on his right hand, a grove that
seemed to wave its shades as a sign of ‘invitation; he
entered it, and found the coolness and verdure +irres"isti-
bly pleasant. He did not, however, forget whither he

    
  

ECLECTIC SERIES. 241

was traveling, but found a narrow way, bordered with
ﬂowers, which appeared to have the same direction with
the main road, and was pleased, that, by this happy
"experiment, he had found means to unite pleasure with

business, and to gain the rewards of +diligence without _

“Fsuffering its +fatigues.

4. He,therefore, still continued to Walk for a time,
without the least remission of his ardor, except that he
was sometimes tempted to stop by the music of the birds,"
which the heat had assembled in the shade, and some-

times amused himself with plucking the ﬂowers that

covered the banks on each side, or the fruits that hung
upon the branches. At last, the green path began to
“Fdecline from its ﬁrst +tendency, and to wind among the
hills’ and thickets, cooled with fountains, and +murmur-
ing with ,+waterfalls.

5. Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to con-
sider, whether it was longer safe to forsake the known

and common track; but, remembering that the heat was

now in its greatest violence; and that the plain was
dusty and uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path,
which he supposed only to make a few meanders, in

compliance with the varieties of the ground, and to end '

at last in the common road.

6. Having thus calmed his» ‘lsolicitude, he renewed his
pace, though he suspected he was_ not gaining ground.
This uneasiness of his mind inclined him to lay hold on
every new object, and give way to every +sensation that
might soothe or divert him. He listened to every +echo,
he mounted every hill for a fresh prospect, he turned
aside to every "‘cascade, and pleased himself with tracing
the course of a gentle river, that rolled” song the trees,
and watered a large region, with ‘Win  e circum-
volutions. 

7. In these ‘lamusements, the hours -'  away un-

  
  
  

counted; his deviations had “fperplexed his emory, and’

he knew not toward what point to travel. He stood

+pensive and confused, afraid to go forward lest he

should go wrong, yet conscious that the time of +1oitering

vanished from before him, and a sudden tempest gath-

painful remembrance of his folly; he now saw how hap-

/_1.m_ONE of the most 'l’prominent features which dis-

of every human creature; they called it so; they claimed
it as such; they +reverenced. and held it fast as the
‘tunalienable gift of the Creator, which was not to be
‘surrendered to power, nor sold for wages.

3. It was theirs, as men; without it, they did not
esteem themselves men ; more than any other ‘privilege
or possession, it was “essential to their happiness, for it
was essential to their toriginal nature; and therefore
they preferred it above wealth, and ease, and country;
and that they might enjoy and exercise it fully, they

forsook houses, and lands, and kindred, their homes,

their native soil, and their fathers’ graves. ;

.4. They left all these; they left England, which,
whatever it might have been called, was not to them a
land of freedom; they launched forth on the pathless
ocean, the wide, +fathomless ocean, soiled not by the
earth beneath, and bounded, all round and above, only
by heaven; and it seemed to them like that better and
‘Vsublimer freedam, which their country knew not, but
of which, they had the conception and image in their
hearts ; and, after a +toilsome and painful voyage, they
came to a hardiand wintry coast, unfruitful and *de30-
late, but unguarded and boundless; its calm silence in-
terrupted not the ascent of their prayers; it had no
eyes to watch, no ears to hearken, no tongues to report
of them; here, again, there was an answer to their soul’-s
desire, and they were satisﬁed, and gave thanks; they
saw that they were free, and the desert smiled. ‘

5. I am telling an old tale; but it is one which must
beCto1d when we speak of those men. It is to be added,
that they transmitted their principles to their children,
and that peopled by such a race, our country was always
free. So longias its ‘tinhabitants were tunmolested by
the mother cduntry, in the exercise of their important
rights, they ‘submitted to the form of English govern-
ment; but when those rights were +invaded, they
spurned even the form away. ,

and spontaneously, and had nothing in it of the W011-

derful or unforeseen. The wonder would have been, if
it had not occurred. It was, indeed, a happy and glori-
ous event, but by no means unnatural; and I intend no
slight to the revered actors in the Revolution, when I
assert that their fathers. before them were as free as
they—every whit as free.

7. The principles of the Revolution were not the sud-
denly acquired property of a few bosoms: they were
abroad in the land in the ages before; they had always
been taught, like the truths of the Bible; they had de-
scended from father to son, down from those primitive

A days, when the tpilgrim established in his simple dwell-

ing, and seated at his blazing ﬁre, piled high from the
forest which shaded his door, repeated to his listening
children the story of his wrongs and his resistance, and
bade them rejoice, though the wild winds and the wild
beasts were howling without, that they had nothing to
fear from great men’s *oppression.

8. Here are the beginnings of the Revolution. Every
settler’s hearth was a school of ‘'independence ; the schol-
ars were apt, and the lessons sunk deeply; and thus it
came that our country was always free ; it could not be
other than free.   _

9. As ‘deeply seated as was the principle of liberty
and resistance to arbitrary power, in the breasts of the
Puritans, it was not more so than their piety and sense
of religious obligation. They were emphatically a peo-
ple whose God was the Lord. Their form of government
was as strictly theocratical, if direct communication be
excepted, as was that of the Jews; insomuch that" it
would be difﬁcult to say, where there was anycivil
authority among them entirely distinct from +ecclesias-
tical “ljurisdiction. 

10. Whenever a few of them settled’ a

their elders were +magistrates, and their code of laws
was the Pentateuch. These were forms, it is true, but
forms which faithful yrindicated principles and feelings;

11. God was their King; and they regarded him as
truly and literally so, as if he had dwelt in a visible pal-
ace in the midst of their state. They were his devoted,

plished ‘nothing without rendering to him the praise;

they suﬁ‘ered nothing without carrying their sorrows,

+implore him to bless. .

12. Their piety was not merely external; it was sin-
cere; it had the proof’ of a good tree in bearing good
fruit; it produced and sustained a» strict morality. Their
+tenacious purity of manners and speech obtained for
them, in the mother country, their name of Puritans,
which, though given in derision, was as honorable an
appellation as was ever bestowed by man on man.

key and ending it in a feeble tone of voice.

While she mourns over their infatuation. But let them

Union is the property of the world, no less than of our-
selves; that it is a part of the divine scheme for the

moral government of the earth, as the ‘solar system is a

part of the ‘‘mechanism of the heavens; that it is des-
tined, while traveling from the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc,
like the ascending sun, to shed its glorious inﬂuence
backward on the states of Europe, and forward on the
empires of Asia.

WILLIAM TELL.

The events here referred to occurred in 1307.

Switzerland had

been conquered by Austria; and Gesler, one of the basest and most

tyrannical of men, was her governor. ‘
.he had his cap elevated on a pole, and commanded that every one
William Tell proudly refused to submit to this

should bow before it.

As a reﬁnement of tyranny,

degrading mark of slavery. He was arrested and carried before the

governor.

The day before, his son Albert, without the knowledge of

his ‘father, had fallen into the hands of Gesler.

VI. MODULATION.

MODULATION includes the variations of the voice. These
may be classed under the heads of Pitch, Compass,
Quantity, and Quality.

_._.:_...._.._._._j.—._.

PITCH AND COMPASS.

IF any one will notice closely a sentence as uttered in pri-
'vate conversation, he will observe that very few “successive
words are pronounced in exactly the same tone. Atthe same
time, however, there is a certain PITCH or key, which leﬁeems,
on the whole, to prevail. I , *

This key note or governing note, as it may be called, is that
upon which" the voice most frequently dwells, to-which it
usually returns when wearied, and upon which a sentence
generally commences and very frequently ends, while, at the
same time, there is a considerable play of the voice above and
below it. I _ ‘

This note may be high or low. It varies in cliﬂ‘eren‘t indi-
viduals, and at different times in the same individual, being
governed by the nature of the subject and the emotions of
the speaker.

The range of the voice above and below this note, is called
its COMPASS. When the speaker is animated, this range is
great; but upon abstract subjects, or with a dull speaker, it is
small. If’, in reading or speaking, too high a note be chosen,

QUEs'r1oNs.——Give examples. What is modulation? What is meant
by the key note? .Is this the same at all times and in all individ-

compass of voice? Under what circumstances is this range great?

1. FEW topics are more inviting, or more ﬁt for +philo-

the lungs will soon become wearied; if too low a pitch be
selected, there is danger of indistinctness of utterance; and
in either case there is less room for compass or variety of tone,
than if one be taken between the two extremes.

‘ y To secure the proper pitch and the greatest compass, observe

the following rule. '

RULE XII.—The reader or speaker should choose that
pitch, in which he can feel himself most at ease, and
above and below which he may have most room for
variation.

REMARK 1.—-Having chosen the proper key note, he
should beware of conﬁning himself to it. This constitutes
monotony, one of the greatest faults in elocution. One very
important instrument for giving expression and life to
thought is thus lost, and the hearer soon becomes wearied
and disgusted.

REMARK 2.———There is another fault ‘of nearly equal mag-
nitude, and of very frequent occurrence. This consists in
varying the tones without reference to the sense. A sentence
is commenced with vehemence and in a high tone, and the
voice; gradually sinks, until the breath being spent, it dies
away in awhisper. .

REMARK 3.-——-The habit of sz'ng—song, so common in reading

poetry, as it is a variation of tone without reference to the

sense, is a species of the fault above mentioned.

REMARK 4.——If the reader or speaker is guided by the
sense, and if he gives that emphasis, inflection, and expression,
required by the meaning, these faults will speedily disappear.

K REMARK _5.——To improve the voice in these respects, prac-
tice is necessary. Commence, for example, with the lowest
pitchthe voice can comfortably sound, and repeat whole para-
graphs and pages upon that key. Then rise one note higher,
and practice on that, then another, and so on, until the

can soil and climate, have poured out their abundance
of +luxuries for the tables of the rich, and of necessaries
for the sustenance of the poor. Birds and animals of
beauty and value, have been added to the European
stocks ; and ‘rtransplantations from the transcendent and
unequaled riches of our forests, have mingled themselves
profusely with the elms, and ashes, and Druidical oaks
-of England. , .

5. America has made +contributions far more vast.
Who can estimate the amount or the value of the +aug-
mentation of the commerce of the world, that has re-
sulted from America? “The can imagine to himself what
would be the shock to the Eastern Continent, if the At-
lantic were no longer +traversable, orthere were no
longer American iproductions or American markets?

6. But America exercises inﬂuences, or holds out ex-
amples for the consideration of the Old VVorld, of a
much higher, because they are of a moral and political
character. America has furnished to Europe, proof of
the fact, that popular “tinstitutions, founded on equality
and the principle of representation, are capable of ‘'main-

, taining governments; able to secure the rights of per-

sons, property, and “‘reputation.

7. America has proved that it is practicable to elevate
the mass of mankind; that portion which, in Europe, is
called the laboring or lower class ; to raise them to self-
respect, to make them 7‘competent to act a part in the
great right and great duty of self-government; and this,

- she has proved, may be done by the ‘“diffusion of knowl-

edge. She holds out an example a thousand, times more
enchanting, than ever was presented before, to those

nine tenths of the human race, who are born without

8. America has furnished to the world the character
of Washington. And if our American institutions had
done nothing else, that alone would have entitled them
to the respect of mankind. Washington! “ First in
war, ﬁrst in peace, and ﬁrst in the hearts of his country-
men !” Washington is all our own!

9. The enthusiastic veneration and regard in which
the people of the United States hold him, prove them to
be worthy of such a countryman; while his reputation
abroad reflects the highest honor on his country and its
institutions. I Would cheerfully put the question to any
of the intelligence of Europe and the world, what char-
acter of the ”*century, upon the whole, stands out on the
relief of history, most pure, most respectable, most sub-
lime; and I doubt not that, by a +suﬁ‘rage approaching
to tunanimity, the answer would be-—-VVashington I

10. This structure>l,< by its uprightness, its solidity, its
+durability, is no unﬁt emblem of his character. His
public virtue and public principles were as ﬁrm as the
earth on which it stands; his personal motives as pure
as the serene heaven in which its summit is lost. But,
indeed, though a ﬁt, it is an ‘‘inadequate emblem. Tow-
ering high above the column which our hands have
builded, beheld not by the inhabitants of a single city,
or a single State, ascends the colossal ‘grandeur of his
character and his life. In all the "‘constituents of the
one, in all the acts of the other, in all its titles to immor-

tal love, admiration, and renown, it is an American pro-

fervid liberty can be combined with law, with order,
with the security of property, with the pursuits and
advancement of happiness; to him who denies that our
institutions are capable of producing exaltation of soul
and the passion of true glory ; to him who denies that
We have contributed any to the stock of great lessons

At the battle of Lempach, A. D. 1315,‘ between the Swiss and Aus-
trians, the latter having obtained possession of a narrow pass in the
mountains, formed a serried phalanx with presented spears. Until
this was broken, the Swiss could not hope to make a successful attack.

Austrian spears, and receiving in his body _-_s many points as possible,

A living wall, a human wood!

All horrent with +projected spears,
Whose polished pointsrbefore them shine,
From ﬂank to ﬂank, one brilliant line,
Bright as the breakers’ splendors run
Along the billows of the sun.

4. Opposed to these, a "thovering band,
Contending for their native land:
Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke
From manly necks the '*"ignoble yoke,
And “tforged their fetters into swords,
Qn equal terms to ﬁght their lords;
And what insurgent rage had gained,
In many a mortal fray maintained:
Marshaled once more at freedom’s call,
They came to conquer or to fall,
Where he who conquered, he who fell,
Was deemed a dead or living Tell!

5. And now the work of life and death

Hung on the passing of a breath;

« The ﬁre of conﬂict burned within ;
The battle trembled to begin: W
Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,

 Point for attack was no where found;
Where’er the impatient Switzers gazed,
The unbroken line of lances blazed;
That line ’t were ‘lsuicide to meet,
And perish at their tyrants’ feet;
How could they rest within their graves,
And leave their homes the homes. of slaves?
Would they not feel their children tread
With clanking chains above their head?’

Annihilates the oppressor’s power;

But every freeman was a host,

7. It did depend on one indeed ;

Behold him! Arnold Vllinkelried !
There sounds not to the trump of fame
The echo of a nobler name.

Unmarked he stood amid the throng,

In +rumination deep and long,

Till you might see with sudden grace,
The Very thought come o’er his face;
And by the motion of his form,
Anticipate the bursting storm;

And by the uplifting of his brow,

Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.
But ’t was no sooner thought than done;
The ﬁeld was in a moment won.

8. “Make way for Liberty!” he cried;
Then ran, with arms extended wide,
As if . his dearest friend to clasp,
Ten spears he swept within his grasp :
“Make way for Liberty!” he cried,
Their keen points met from side to side;
He bowed among them like a tree,
' And thus made way for Liberty.

9. Swift to the breach his comrades ﬂy;

“Make way for Liberty!” they cry,

And through the Austrian phalanx dart,

As rushed the spears through Arnold’s heart;
While +instantaneous as his fall,

Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all.

An earthquake could not overthrow

A city with a surer blow.

Thus Death made way for Liberty!

THE SCRIPTURES AND THE SAVIOR.

The following is an extract from the writings of Rousseau, a French
author of distinction, but a noted and avowed Inﬁdel.

UTTER distinctly all the consonants in the following and similar
words in this lesson: majesty, scriptures, sanctity, gospel, subject,
philosopher, distance, enthusiast, instructions, described, disgrace,
exactly, rewards, sobriety, midst, friends, fabricate.

1. THE majesty of the Scriptures ‘strikes me with
astonishment, and the sanctity of the gospel addresses
itself to my heart. Look at the volumes of the +philos-
ophers, with all their pomp : how lcontemptible do they
appear in *comparison with this! Is it possible, that a
book at once so simple and sublime, can be the work of
man?

2'. Can he who is the subject of its history, be him-
self a mere man? Was his the tone of an enthusiast, or
of an +ambitious sectary? What sweetness ! What +pu-
rity in his manners! What an affecting +gracefulness
in his instructions ! What sublimity in his maxims!
What ‘iprofound wisdom in his *discourses! What pre-
sence of mind, what +sagacity and ‘lpropriety in his
answers! How great the command over his passions!

ECLECTIC SERIES. 281

Where is the man, where the philosopher, who could so
live, suffer, and die, without weakness and without “tos-
tentation?

3. Wheii Plato described his +imaginary good man,
covered with all the disgrace of crime, yet worthy of all
the rewards of virtue, he described exactly the charac-
ter of Jesus Christ. The resemblance was so striking,
it could not be mistaken, and all the fathers of the
church perceived it. Wliat prepossession, what blindness
must it be, to com_pare the son of Sophronius to the son
of Mary! VVhat an ﬁmmeasurable distance between
them! Socrates, dying without pain, and without igno-
miny, easily supported his character to the last; and if
his death, however easy, had not crowned his life, it
might have been doubted whether Socrates, with all his
wisdom, was any thing more than a mere sophist.

4.‘ He, ‘‘invented, it is said, the theoryof moral
iscience. Others, however, had before him put it in
practice; and he had nothing to do but to tell what they
had done, and to reduce their examples to precept.
Aristides had been just, before Socrates deﬁned what
justice was. Leonidas had died for his country, before
Socrates made it a duty to love one’s country. Sparta
had been temperate, before Socrates eulogized ‘fsobriety;
and before he ’'celebrated the praises of virtue, Greece
abounded in virtuous men.

5. But from whom of all his countrymen, could Jesus

have derived that sublime and pure morality, of which
he only has given us both the precepts and example?

1 In the midst of the most tlicentious fanaticism, the voice

of the sublimestwisdom was heard; and the simplicity
of the most +heroic virtue crowned one of the humblest
of all the +multitude. S

6. The death of Socrates, peacefully philosophizing
with his friends, is the most pleasant that could be de-

. sired! That of Jesus, expiring in torments, ioutraged,
+reviled, and execrated by a whole nation, is the most ,

horrible that could be feared. Socrates, in receiving the

QUANTITY AND QUALITY.

THE tones of the voice should vary, also, in quantity,
or degree of loudnessyand in quality, or expression, ac-
cording to the nature of the subject.  

REMARK.-—We notice a diﬂerence between the soft, in-

 
 

 
 

sinuating tones of persuasion; the full, strong voice of com- I

mand and decision; the harsh, irregular, and sometimes grating
explosion of the sounds of passion; the plaintive notes of
sorrow and pity; and the equable and uniinpassioned ‘flow of
words in argumentative style.

attention. ~

sented it: but Jesus, in the midst of excruciating tor-
ture, prayed for his +merciless ltormentors.

7. Yes! if the life and death of Socrates were those
of a sage, the life and death of Jesus were those of a
God. Shall we say that the evangelical history is a
mere +ﬁction? It does not bear the stamp of ﬁction, but
the contrary. The history of Socrates, which nobody
doubts, is not as well “Fattested as that of Jesus Christ.

Such an assertion in fact only shifts the difficulty, With-  

out removing it. It is more inconceivable that a number
of persons should have agreed to fabricate this book,
than that one only should have furnished the subject
of it. s

8. The Jewish authors were +incapable of the diction,
and strangers to the +morality, contained in the gospel,
the marks of whose truth are so striking, so perfectly
“linimitable, that the ‘Finventor would be a more aston-
ishing man than the hero.

QUESTIONS.---HOW does P1ato’s character of what a good man ought
to be, correspond with what Christ was? What differences can you
mention between the life and death of Christ, and those of Socrates?
In What country did Aristides, Leonidas, Plato, and Socrates live? Is
the history of Socrates any better attested than that of Christ? Why
is it inconceivable that the book is a ﬁction? Suppose it an inven-
tion of man; which would be the most Wonderful, the inventor or the
hero? Who was the author of this extract? How could an inﬁdel
express such sentiments? Are not men often forced unwillingly to
acknowledge the truth?

THE BLIND PREACHER.

REMAnK.——The pathos of the description in the following lesson is
its great beauty, and requires an appropriate tone and manner.

1. As I traveled through the county of Orange, my
eye was caught by a cluster of horses tied near a +ruin-
ous, old, wooden house in the forest, not far from the
roadside. Having frequently seen such objects before,
in traveling through these States, I had no +diﬂicu1ty in
+understanding that this was a place of religious wor-
ship. ,
2. Devotion alone should have stopped me to join in

the duties of the +congregation; but I must confess,

that curiosity to hear the preacher of such a Wilderness,
was not the least of my motives. On entering, I was
struck with his preternatural appearance. He was a
tall and very spare old man; his head, which was cov-
ered with a white linen cap, his shriveled hands, and his
voice, were all shaking under the inﬂuence of a lpalsyg

284. NEW FIFTH READER.

and a few moments ‘rascertained to me that he was per-
fectly blind.

3. The first emotions that touched my breast were
those of mingled pity and veneration. But how soon

were all my feelings changed? The lips of Plato were ,

never more worthy of a prognostic swarm of bees, than
were the lips of this holy man! It was a day of the
”'administration of the '*sacrament; and his subject was,
of course, the passion of our Savior. I had heard the
subject handled a thousand times; I had thought it
exhausted long ago. Little did I suppose, that, in the
wild woods of America, I was to meet with a man,
whose eloquence would give to this topic a new and
more sublime pathos, than I had ever before witnessed.

4. As he descended from the pulpit, to +distribute
the mystic symbols, there was a +peculiar, a more than
humanfsolemnity in his air and manners, which made
my blood-run cold, and my whole frame shiver. He
then drew a picture of the sufferings of our Savior; his
trial before Pilate; his ascent up Calvary; his +cruci—
ﬁxion. I knew the whole history; but never until then,
had I heard the circumstances so ‘Fselected, so arranged,
so colored. It was all new; and I seemed to have heard
it for the ﬁrst time in my life. His enunciation was so
ideliberate, that his voice trembled on every syllable;
and every heart in the assembly trembled in unison.

5. His peculiar phrases had that force of ‘'descrip-
tion, that the original scene appeared to be at that
moment acting before our eyes. We saw the very faces
of the Jews; the staring, frightful distortion of malice
and rage. VVe saw the buffet; my soul kindled with a
ﬂame of ‘indignation; and myhands were +involun-
tarily and iconvulsively clinched. '

6. But when he came to touch on the patience, the
forgiving meekness of our Savior; when he drew, to
the life, his voice breathing to God a soft and gentle
prayer of pardon on his enemies, “Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do,” the voice of the
preacher, which‘had all along faltered, grew fainter,

U

until, his +utterance being entirely obstructed by the
force of his feelings, he raised his handkerchief to his
eyes, and burst into a loud and +irrepressible ﬂood of
grief. The effect was ‘tinconceivable. The Whole house
resounded With the mingled ‘groans, and sobs, and
shrieks of the congregation.

7. It Was some time before the tumult had subsided,
so far as to permit him to proceed. Indeed, judging by
the usual, but fallacious standard of my own Weakness,
I began to be very uneasy for the situation of the
preacher. For I could not conceive how he would be

able to let his audience down from the hight to which he

had Wound them, Without ‘‘impairing the ‘Fsolemnity and
+dignity of the subject, or perhaps shocking them by
the abruptness of his fall. But, no: the descent was as
beautiful and sublime, as the elevation had been rapid
and *enthusiastic.  

8. The ﬁrst sentence, With which he broke the awful
silence Was a quotation from Rousseau: “Socrates died
like a philosopher, but Jesus Christ, like a God!” I
despair of giving you any idea of the effect produced
by this short sentence, unless you could +perfeetly.oon-
ceive the Whole manner of the man, as Well as the pecu-
liar crisis in the discourse. Never before did I com-
pletely understandvvhat Demosthenes meant by laying
such stress on '*‘delivery.

9. You are to bring before you the venerable ﬁgure
of the preacher; his blindness, constantly recalling to

, your recollection old Homer, Ossian, and Milton, and

associating with his performance the melancholy +grand-
eur of their geniuses; you are to imagine that you hear
his slow, solemn, well-accented enuneiation, and his
voice of affecting trembling melody; you are to remem-
ber the pitch of passion and enthusiasm, to which the
congregation Were raised: and then, the few moments of
portentous, death-like silence, which reigned through-
out the house; the preacher, removing his vvhite hand-
kerchief from his aged face (even yet Wet from the
recent torrent of his tears), and slowly stretching forth

the palsied hand which held it, begins the sentence,
“Socrates died like a philosopher ”——then, pausing, rais-
ing his other hand, pressing them both clasped together
With warmth and energy to his breast, lifting his
“ sightless balls” to heaven, and pouring his whole soul
into his “ttremulous voice——-“but Jesus Christ——like a

~Grod!”

10. This man has been before my imagination almost

ever since. A thousand times, as I rode along, I dropped W

the reins of my bridle, stretched forth my hand, and
tried to imitate his ‘quotation from Rousseau; a thou-
sand times I abandoned the attempt in despair, and felt
persuaded, that his peculiar manner and power arose
from an ‘’energy of soul, which nature could give, but
which no human being could justly copy. As I recall,
at this moment, several of his awfully striking +atti~
tudes, the chilling tide with which my blood begins to
pour along my +arterjies, reminds me of the emotions
produced by the ﬁrst sight of Gray’s +introductory pic-
ture of his Bard.

QUEsrIoNs.———Can you describe the personal appearance of the blind
preacher? What effect was produced by his manner? When he
described the character and conduct of Christ, what was the effect on
the congregation? What effect was produced by the circumstance of
his blindness? What was the secret of the preacher’s great power?

THE BIBLE, THE REST or CLASSICS.

REMARK.——Speak every syllable distinctly, and do not slip over the
little Words, nor pronounce them Wrong.

ARTICULATE distinctly the following and similar Words in this
lesson. Do not say worl for World ; no-bles for no-blest ; gzf for
gift; re-ﬂee for reﬂect ; juss for just; e-van-gel‘-iss for e-van-
gel-ist. _

‘ 1. THERE is a classic, the best the World has ever seen,
the noblest that has ever honored and ‘digniﬁed the lan-
guage of mortals. If We look into its antiquity, We dis-
cover a title to our veneration, unrivaled in the history
of ‘literature. If We have respect to its evidences, they
are found in the testimony of miracle and prophesy; in
the ministry of man, of nature, and of angels, yea, even
of “God, manifest in the ﬂesh,” of “God blessed for-
ever.”

2. If We ‘consider its authenticity, no other pages.
have survived the lapse of time,‘ that can be compared
with it. If We eXamine*its ‘authority, for it speaks as
never man spake, We discover, that it came from heaven,
in ‘vision and ‘prophesy, under the sanction of Him,
Who is Creator of all things, and the Giver of every
good and perfect gift. ' '

3. If We reﬂect on its truths, they are lovely and spot-
less, sublime and holy as God himself", ‘unchangeable as
his nature, durable as his righteous ‘dominion, and ver-
satile as the moral condition of mankind. If We regard

ECLECTIC SERIES. 289

the value of its treasures, we must testimate them, not
like the relics of classic antiquity, by the perishable
glory and beauty, virtue and happiness, of this world,
but by the enduring ‘“perfection and supreme lfelicity of
an eternal kingdom.

4.-. If we inquire, who are the men, that have 'l‘recorded
its truths, vindicated its rights, and ‘lillustrated the ‘ex-
cellence of its scheme, from the depth of ages and from
the living world, from the populous continent and the
isles of the sea, comes forth the answer: the patriarch

‘ and the prophet, the evangelist and the *-‘martyr.

5. If we look abroad through the world of men, the
victims of folly or vice, the +prey of cruelty, of injustice,
and inquire what are its beneﬁts, even in this “ttemporal
state, the great and the humble, the rich and the poor,
the powerful and the weak, the learned and the igno-
rant reply, as with one voice, that humility and +resig-
nation, purity, order and peace, faith, hope, and charity,
are its blessings upon earth.

6. And if, raising our eyes from time to eternity, from
the world of mortals to the world of just men made per-
fect, from the visible creation, imarvelous, beautiful, and
glorious as it is, to the invisible creation of angels and

seraphs, from the foot-stool of God to the throne of -

God himself, we ask, what are the blessings that flow
from this single volume, let the question be answered by
the pen of the evangelist, the harp of the prophet, and
the records of the book of life.

7. Such is the best of classics the world has ever
admired; such, the noblest that man has ever adopted
as a guide.

QUESTI‘ONS.——Why is the Bible called a classic? What is said of
the antiquity of the Bible? What is said of its evidences? What,
of its authenticity? What, of the nature of its truths? What, of
the men who Wrote it and have defended it? What is said of the
change it produces in the character of men? What, of its bearing
upon our future prospects?

Name the nouns in the last paragraph. The verbs. The adjectives.
The adverbs. ‘

It is delightful to drop in on a friend Without the solemn
prelude of invitation and ‘'"acceptance, to join a ”"social

relax and expand in the happy consciousness of perfect
security from invidious remark and carping criticism;
Where We may give the reins to the isportiveness of
innocent fancy, or the enthusiasm of warm-hearted

feeling; Where We may talk sense or nonsense (I pity
people Who can not talk nonsense), Without fear of being
looked into icicles by the coldness of iunimaginativc
people, living pieces of clock Work, who dare not them-
selves utter a Word, or lift up a little ﬁnger, Without ﬁrst
Weighing the important point in the hair balance of
'!propriety and good breeding.

2. It is equally delightful to let the pen talk freely,
and +unpremeditatedly, and to one by Whom We are
sure of bei.ng«understood; but a formal letter, like a
+ceremonious morning visit, is tedious alike to the Writer
and receiver; for the most ! part spun out With unmean—
ing phrases, itrite observations, ‘“complimentary ﬂour-
ishes, and protestations of respect and attachment, so
far not deceitful, as they never deceive anybody. Oh,
the misery of having to compose a set, proper, Well-
Worded, correctly-pointed, polite, elegant epistle! one
that must have a beginning, a middle, and an end, as
methodically arranged and portioned out, as the several
parts of a sermon under three heads, or the gradations
of shade in a school-girl’s ﬁrst landscape!

3. For my part, I Would rather be set to beat hemp,
or Weed in a turnip ﬁeld, than to Write such a letter
exactly every month, or every fortnight, at the +precise
point of time from, the date of our correspondent’s last
letter, that he or she Wrote after the reception of ours;
as if one’s thoughts bubbled up to the +Well-head, at

regular periods, a pint at a time, to be bottled off for

immediate use. Thought! What has thought to do in

such a correspondence? It murders thought, quenches

fancy, Wastes time, spoils paper, Wears out innocent
goose quills. “I’d rather be a kitten, and cry mew!

be struck out to ““obviate the necessity (if such necessity
exists) of so tasking, degrading the human intellect.

8. What were the labors of Hercules to such a task? ‘

The very thought of it puts me into a mental perspira-
tion; and, from my inmost soul, I compassionate the
unfortunates now (at this very moment, perhaps),
screwed up lpcrpendicularly in the seat of torture, hav-

ing in the right hand a fresh-nibbed patent pen, dipped ‘

ever and anon into the ink bottle, as if to hook up ideas,
and under the outspread palm of the left hand a fair
sheet of best Bath post (ready to receive thoughts yet
unhatched), on which their eyes are riveted with a stare
of +disconsolate +perpleXity inﬁnitely touching to a feel-
ing mind.

9. To such unhappy persons, in whose miseries I
deeply sympathize Have I not groaned under similar
horrors, from the hour when I was first shut up (under
lock and key, I believe), to indite a dutiful epistle to an
honored aunt? I remember, as if it were yesterday, the
moment when she, who had enjoined the task, entered to
inspect the “performance, which, by her +calculation,
should have been fully completed. I remember how
sheepishly I hung down my head, when she snatched
from before me the paper (on which I had made no
farther progress than “My dear ant”), angrily exclaim-
ing, “What, child! have you been shut up here three
hours, to call your aunt a pismire?”

10. From that hour of humiliation I have too often
groaned under the ‘Fendurance of similar penance, and
I have learned from my own sufferings to *compas-
sionate those of my dear sisters in affliction. To such
unhappy persons, then, I would fain offer a few hints
(the fruit of long experience), which, if they have not
already been suggested by their own observation, may
prove serviceable in the hour of ’“emergency.

superstition, the gift of second sight, or prophesy, forewarns him of
the disastrous event of the +enterprise, and exhorts him to return
home, and avoid the destruction which certainly awaited him, and
which afterward fell upon him at the battle of Culloden, in 1745.

1. Seer. LOCHIEL I Lochiel I beware of the day

When the lowlands shall meet thee in battle array!
For a ﬁeld of the dead rushes red on my sight,

And the clans of Culloden are scattered in ﬁght;
They rally, they bleed, for their kingdom and crown ;
Woe, Woe to the riders that +trample them down I
Proud Cumberland prances, insulting the slain,

And their hoof-beaten bosoms are trod to the plain.

But hark! through the fast-ﬂashing lightning of war,
What steed to the desert ﬂies +frantic and far?

Oh weep, but thy tears can not number the dead ;
For a merciless sword on Culloden shall wave,

REBELLION IN MASSACHUSETTS STATE PRISON.

1. A MORE +impressive iexhibition of moral courage,
opposed to the wildest iferocity, under the most +appal1-
ing circumstances, Was never seen, than that which was
witnessed, by the oﬂicers of our State Prison, in the
rebellion which occurred about ﬁve years since.

2. Three convicts had been sentenced under the rules
of the prison to be Whipped in the yard, and by some
effort of one of the other prisoners, a door had been

ECLECTIC SERIES. 301

opened at midday ‘Fcommunicating with the great dining
hall, and through the warden’s lodge with the street.

3. The di_ning hall is long, dark, and damp, from its
situation near the surface of the ground; and in this all
the prisoners assembled, with clubs, and such tools as
they could seize in passing through the work shops.

4. Knives, hammers, and chisels, With every variety
of such weapons, were in the hands of the ferocious

spirits, who are drawn away from their +encroachments ,

on society, forming a ‘'congregation of strength, vileness,
and talent, that can hardly be equaled on earth, even
among the famed brigands of Italy.

5. Men of all ages and characters, guilty‘of every
variety} of ‘Finfamous crime, dressed in the motley and
peculiar garb of the institution, and displaying the wild
and demoniac appearance that always pertains to im—
prisoned wretches, were gathered together for the single
purpose of preventing the punishment which was to be
inﬂicted on the morrow, upon their ‘Fcomrades.

6. The warden, the surgeon, and some other oﬂicers
of the prison, were there at the time, and were alarmed
at. the consequences likely to ensue from the +conﬂict
necessary to restore order. They huddled together, and
could scarcely be said to consult, as the stoutest among
them lost all presence of mind in overwhelming fear.
The news rapidly spread through the town, and a sub-
ordinate officer, of most mild and kind +disp0sition, hur-
ried to the scene, and came calm and collected into the
midst of the officers. The most +equable—tempered and
the mildest man in the government, was in this hour of
peril the ﬁrmest.

7. He instantly dispatched a request to Major Wain-

‘right, commander of the marines ‘‘stationed at the navy

yard, for assistance, and declared his purpose to enter
into the hall and try_the force of ﬁrm demeanor and
+persuasion upon the enraged multitude.

. 8. All his brethren exclaimed against an attempt so
full of hazard; but in vain. They offered him arms, a
sword and pistols, but he refused them, and said, that he

PREFACE.

THIS, the ﬁfth in the series of the remodeled, Eclectic Readers,
differs from the preceding volumes, chieﬂy, in its grade. The les-
sons are more diﬂicult, the lists of errors in articulation and pro-

nunciation are more extensive, and the questions, more copious ‘

and varied.

A considerable amount of. new matter, derived from the best
' sources of English literature, has been added.

The introductory article. on READIING is commended to the notice
of the teacher, as containing important instruction upon that subject,
with copious illustrations and exercises. Miscellaneous exercises
in articulation are also interspersed between the lessons.

The SPELLING and DEFINING EXERCISES, placed at the head of the
lessons, are copious, and at the same time, select. In addition to
these, words are also marked in the lessons to be spelled and de-
ﬁned by the pupil. T *

The grammatical questions are particularly commended to the

attention of the teacher, as a valuable feature. Few are aware,

until a trial, how closely reading and grammatical analysis may be

proﬁtably united. V ’
The Reading Lessons have been very carefully selected. It has

been the great object of the compiler to present the best specimens

of style, to insure interest in the subjects, to impart valuable in— »

formation, and, especially, to exert a decided and healthy moral
and religious inﬂuence. '

As very little material is found in a form appropriate to practice
as reading lessons, the matter has here been extensively remodeled

and rearranged, so as to adapt it to its place in this volume. On a

this account, the lessons are credited in the contents as being
' '‘from’’ the authors named. '

32 POETIC PAUSES.

VII. POETIC PAUSES.

IN poetry, we have, in addition to other pauses, POETIC
PAUSES. The object of these is simplyto promote the
melody.

At the end of each line, a slight pause is generally

proper, whatever be the grammatical construction or the

sense. The purpose of this is, to make prominent the
melody of the measure, and, in rhyme, to allow the ear
to appreciate the harmony of the similar sounds.

There is, also, another ‘important pause, somewhere
near the middle of each line, which is called the cesum or
cesumlpause. In the following lines it is marked thus—~.

EXAMPLES.

There are hours long departed———which memory-bx-in gs,
Like blossoms of Eden~—to twine round the heart,

And as time rushes by——on the might of his wings,
They may darken awhile—-but they never depart.

T REMARK.—-The cesural pause should never be so placed as
to injure the sense. The following lines, if melody alone were
consulted, would be read thus,

With fruitless la—-bor Clara bound V
And strove to stanch——-the gushing wound;
The Monk with un—availing cares, '

‘ Exhausted all——the church’s prayers.

This manner of reading, however, it will be readily per-
ceived, would very much interfere with the proper expression
of the idea. This is to be corrected, by making the cesural
pause yield to the sense. The melody is not injured by this,
as much as might be supposed.  above lines should be
read thus, .  is
With fruitless 1abor—Clara bound,

And strove to stanch——the gushing Wound;

QUEsTIoNs.—What pause is peculiar to poetry? What is the "object"

of this pause? Where is a slight pause generally proper? What is
its object? What other pause in poetry is used? What is it called?
Point it out in the examples. What caution is given with regard to
its use?

had no fear, and in case of danger, arms would do him
no service: and alone, with only a little ratan, whi.ch
was his usual walking stick, he advanced into the hall,
to hold parley with the selected, +congregated, and en-
raged villains of the whole +commonwealth.

9. He demanded their purpose, in thus coming to-
gether with arms, in violation of the prison laws»
They replied, that they were determined to obtain the
remission of the punishment of their three comrades.
He said, it was impossible; the rules of the prison must
be obeyed, and they must submit. —

10. At the hint of submission, they drew a little

’ nearer together, prepared their weapons for service, and

as theywere dimly seen in the further end of the hall,
by those Who observed, from the gratings that opened
up to the day, a more appalling sight can not be con-
ceived, nor one of more moral ‘grandeur, than that of
the single man, standing within their grasp, and exposed
to be torn limb from limb instantly, if a word or look
should add to the already +intense excitement.

11. That excitement, too, was of a most dangerous
kind. It broke not forth in noise and imprecations, but
was seen only in the dark looks and the strained nerves,
that showed a deep determination. The ofﬁcer +expostu-
lated. He reminded them of the thopelessness of escape;
that the town was alarmed, and that the government of
the prison would submit to nothing but unconditional

  surrender. He said, that all those who would go quietly

away, ‘should be forgiven for this offense; but, that if
every‘ prisoner was killed in the contest, power enough
would be obtained to enforce the regulations of the
prison. '

12. They replied, that they expected that some would
be killed, that death would be better than such impris-
onment, and with that look and tone, which bespeaks an
indomitable purpose, they declared, that not a man
should leave the hall" alive, till the ﬂogging was remitted.
At this period of the +discussion, their evil passions
seemed to be more inﬂamed, and one or two offered to

ECLECTIC SERIES. 303

destroy the ofﬁcer, who still stood ﬁrmer, and with a
more temperate pulse, than did his friends, who saw
from above, but could not “‘‘avert the danger that threat-
ened him.

13. Just at thismoment, and in about ﬁfteen" minutes
from the “‘“commencement of the tumult, the oﬁicer saw
the feet of the marines, whose presence alone he relied
on for +succor, ﬁling by the small upper lights. Without
any apparent anxiety, he had repeatedly turned his at-

tention to their approach, and now he knew that it was

his only time to escape, before a +conﬂict for life became,
as was expected, one of the most dark and dreadful in
the world.

14. He stepped slowly backward, still urging themvto
depart, before the oﬂicers were driven to use the last re-
sort of ﬁrearms. When wi_thin three or four feet of the
door, it was opened, and closed instantly again, as he
sprang through, and was thus unexpectedly restored to
his friends.

15. Major VVainright was requested to order his
men to ﬁre down upon the convicts through the little
windows, ﬁrst with powder and then with ball, till they
were willing to retreat; but he took a wiser as well as a
bolder course, relying upon the effect which ﬁrm deter-
mination would have upon men so +critically situated.
He ordered the door to be again opened, and marched in
at the head of twenty or thirty men, who ﬁled through
the passage, and formed at the end of the hall, opposite

to the crowd of criminals thuddled together at the other.‘

16. He stated that he was empowered to quell the re-

bellion, that he wished to avoid shedding blood, but that

he should not quit that hall alive, till every convict had
returned to his duty. They seemed ‘Fbalancing the
strength of the two parties; and replied, that some of
them were ready to die, and only waited for an attack to
see which was the most powerful, swearing that they
would ﬁght to the last, unless the punishment was remit-
ted, for they would not submit to any such punishment
in the prison. Major Wainriglit ordered his marines to
load their pieces, and, that they might not be suspected

304 NEW FIFTH READER.

of triﬂing, each man was made to hold up to view the
bullet which he afterward put in his gun.

17. This only caused a growl of determination, and
no one blenched, or seemed disposed to shrink from the
foremost +eXposure. They knew that their number

would enable them to bear down and destroy the hand-A

ful of marines, after the first discharge, and before their
pieces could be reloaded. Again, they were ordered to

retire ; but they answered with more ferocity than ever. ,

The marines were ordered to take their aim so as to be
sure and kill as many as possible. Their guns were pre-
sented, but not a prisoner stirred, except to grasp more
ﬁrmly his weapon.

18. Still desirous to avoid such a +tremendous slaugh-I
ter, as must have followed the discharge of a single gun,
Major Wai111°ight advanced a step or two, and spoke
even more ﬁrmly than before, urging them to depart.
Again, and while looking directly into the muzzles of
the guns, which they had seen loaded with ball, they
declared their intention “to ﬁght it out.” This +intrepid
oﬂicer then took out his watch, and told his men to hold
their pieces aimed at the convicts, but not to ﬁre till
they had orders; then, turning to the prisoners, he said,
“You must leave this hall ; I give you three minutes to
decide; if at the end of that time, a man remains, he
shall be shot dead.”

19. No situation of greater interest than this, can be
conceived. At one end of the hall, a fearful multitude
of the most ‘desperate and powerful men in existence,
waiting for the ‘assault; at the other, a little band of
+disciplined men, waiting with arms presented, and
ready, upon the least motion or sign, to begin the
carnage ; and their tall and imposing commander, hold-
ing up his watch to count the lapse of three minutes,
given as the reprieve to the lives of hundreds. No poet
or painter can conceive of a spectacle of more dark and
terrible *sublimity; no human heart can conceive a
situation of more appalling suspense.

20. For two minutes, not a person nor a. muscle was

’ ECLECTIC SERIES. 305

moved, not a sound was heard in the unwonted stillness
of the prison, except the labored breathings of the ‘fin-
furiated wretches, as they began to pant, between fear
and revenge: at the expiration of two minutes, during
which they had faced the ministers of death with “tun-
blenching eyes, two or three of those in the rear, and
nearest the further entrance, went slowly out: a few
more followed the example, dropping out quietly and
+deliberately ; and before half of the last minute was
gone, every man was struck by the panic, and crowded
for an exit, and the hall was cleared as if by magic.

21. Thus the steady ﬁrmness of moral force, and the
strong effect of ‘Fdetermination, acting deliberately, awed
the most savage men, and ‘suppressed a scene of car-

nage, which would have instantly followed the least

+precipitancy or exertion of physical force.

QUESTIONS.-Give an account of the...scene described in this lesson.
What accounts for the conduct of the subordinate officer, who, though
ordinarily the mildest-, was on this occasion the ﬁrmest? Suppose
Major W. had ﬁred through the windows, as he was advised, what
would have been, in all probability, the result? What gained this
bloodless victory ?

RELIGION, THE ONLY BASIS OF SOCIETY.

A R T I C U L A T E clearly all ,the consonants in the following and
similar words in this lesson: stability, prosperity, interested, prin-
ciples, friend, suspect, comprehends, fabric, concerns, itself, im-
provements, perpetrator, extinction, describe, unprotected, trample,
restraints.

1. RELIGION is a social concern; for it operates power-

i fully on society, +contributing, in various ways to its

stability and prosperity. Religion is not merely a pri-
vate affair; the “Fcommunity is deeply interested in its
+diﬁ’usion; for it is the best support of the virtues and
principles, on which the social order rests. Pure and
undeﬁled religion is, to do good; and it follows, very
plainly, that, if God be the Author and Friend of society,
then, the recognition of him must enforce all social duty,
and enlightened piety must give its whole strength to
public order.

2. Few men suspect, perhaps no man icomprehends,

if the extent of the support given by religion to every vir-

tue. No man, perhaps, is aware, how much our moral and
”'social sentiments are fed from this fountain; how +power-
less conscience would become without the belief of a
God; how palsied would be human benevolence, were
there not the sense of a higher benevolence to quicken
and sustain it; how suddenly the whole social fabric
would quake, and with what a fearful crash it would
sink into hopeless ruin, were the ideas of a supreme
Being, of "‘accountableness and of a future life, to be
utterly erased from every mind.

ECLECTIC SERIES. 307

3. And, let men thoroughly believe that they are the
Workand sport of chance ; that no superior ‘‘intelligence
concerns itself With human affairs; that all their im-
provements perish forever at death ; that the Weak have
no lguardian, and the injured no +avenger; that there is
no “frecompense for sacriﬁces to uprightness and the
public good; that an oath is unheard in heaven; that
secret crimes have no Witness but the perpetrator; that

human existence has no purpose, and human virtue no ,

unfailing friend; that this brief life is every thing to us,
and death is total, ‘teverlasting extinction ; once let them
thoroughly +abandon religion, and who can conceive or
describe the extent of the desolation Which would
follow? '

4. VVe hope, perhaps, that human laws and natural
sympathy would hold society together. As reasonably
might We believe, that were the sun quenched in the
heavens, our torches Would +illuminate, and our ﬁres
quicken and fertilize the creation. VVhat is there in
human nature to awaken respect and tenderness, if man
is the ‘‘unprotected insect of a day? And What is he
more, if atheism be true‘?

5. Erase all thought and fear of God from a commu-
nity, and selﬁshness and sensuality would absorb the
Whole man. Appetite, knowing no restraint, and suffering,
having no solace or hope, Would trample in scorn on the
restraints of human laws. Virtue, duty, principle,Would
be mocked and spurned as unmeaning sounds. A *sordid
self-interest would +supplant every feeling; and man
would become, in fact, what the theory in atheism de-
clares him to be,—-—a companion for brutes.

Q,UEs'rIoNs.—-—What is the operation of religion upon society ? What

-would be the effect of the removal of religion, upon the Whole ‘fabric

of virtue? Why would not human laws and sympathies hold society
together ?

I know his heart is kind and fond, I know he loveth me,

But loveth yet his mother more, with grateful fervency.

But that which others most admire is the thought which ﬁlls

his mind;

The food for grave, inquiring speech he every where doth ﬁnd. ‘

Strange questions doth he ask of me, when we together walk;
He scarcely thinks as children think, or talks as children talk.
Nor cares he much for childish sports, dotes not on bat or ball,
But looks on manhood’s ways and works, and aptly mimics all.
His little heart is busy still, and oftentimes perplexed

With thoughts about this world of ours, and thoughts about

the next.

He kneels at his dear mother’s knee, she teaches him to pray;
And strange, and sweet, and solemn, then, are the words which

A holier and a wiser man I trust that he will be ;

I have a son, a second son, a simple child of three ;

I’ll not declare how bright and fair his little features be,

How silver sweet those tones of his when he +prattles onimy
knee:

I do not think his light-blue eye is, like his brother’s, keen,

Nor his brow so full of childish thought as his has ever been ;

But his little heart’s a ‘fountain, pure, of kind and tender
feeling;

And his every look’s a gleam of light, rich depths of love
revealing.

When he walks with me, the country folks, who pass us in the
street,

Will shout for. joy, and bless my boy, he looks so mild and
sweet.

A playfellow is he to all, and yet with cheerful tone

Will sing his little song of love, when left to sport alone.

His presence is like sunshine sent, to +gladden home and

hearth,
To comfort us in all our griefs, and sweeten all our mirth.
Should he grow up to riper years, God grant his heart may
A prove

As sweet at home for heavenly grace as now for earthly love ;
And if, beside his grave, the tears our aching eyes must dim,
God comfort us for all the love that we shall lose in him.

I have a son, a third sweet son ; his age I can not tell,

For they reckon not by years and months where he is gone to
dwell.

To us for fourteen ianxious months his infant smiles were given,

And then he bid farewell to earth, and went to live in heaven.

I can not tell what form his is, what looks he weareth now,

Nor guess how bright a glory crowns his shining seraph brow;

The thoughts that ﬁll his sinless soul, the ibliss which he doth
feel,

Are numbered with the secret things which God will not +reveal.

But I know (for God hath told me this) that he is now at rest,

Whére other blessed infants -be, on their Savior’s loving breast:

I know his spirit feels no more this weary load of ﬂesh,

But his sleep is blessed with endless dreams of joy forever
fresh.

I’ know the angels fold-him close beneath their glittering wings,
And soothe him with a song that breathes of heaven’s +divin-

I know that we shall meet our babe (his mother dear and I)
Where God for aye shall wipe away all tears from every eye.
Whate’er befalls his brethren twain, his bliss can never cease ;

Their lot may here«be grief and fear, but his is certain peace. .

9. It may be that the tempter’s wiles their souls from bliss may
sever,
But, if our own poor faith fail not, he must be ours forever.
When we think of what our darling is, and what we still
must be ;
When we muse on that world’s perfect bliss, and this world’s
misery ;
When we groan beneath this load of sin, and feel this grief
and pain, ‘
O, we’d rather lose our other two, than have him here again.

1. THE happiest bird of our spring, however, and one

that rivals the European lark in my estimation, is the
boblincon, or boblink, as he is commonly called. He
arrives at that choice portion of our year, which, in this
latitude, answers to the description of the month of May
so often given by the poets. With us it begins about the
middle of May, and lasts until nearly the middle of

June. Earlier than this,‘ winter is apt to return on its
traces, and to blight the opening beauties of the year;
and later than this, begin the parching, and panting, and
idissolving heats of sumnier. But in this genial inter-
val, Nature is in all her freshness and ‘fragrance: “ the
rains are over and gone, the ﬂowers appear upon the
earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the
voice of the turtle is heard in the land.”

2. The trees are now in their fullest +foliage and
brightest verdure; the woods are gay with the clustered
flowers of the laurel; the air is perfumed with the sweet-

brier and the wild rose; the meadows are enameled with ;

clover blossoms; while the young apple, peach, and the
plum begin to swell, and the cherry to glow among the
green leaves.

3. This is the chosen season of revelry of the boblink.
He comes amid the pomp and fragrance of the season;
his life seems all ‘Fsensibility and enjoyment, all song and
sunshine. ' He is to be found in the soft bosoms of the
freshest and sweetest meadows, and is most in song when
the clovegj is in blossom. He +perches on the topmost
twig of aifféree, or on some long, +ﬂaunting weed, and as
he rises and sinks with the breeze, pours forth a *suc-
cession of rich, tinkling notes, crowding one upon

another. like the outpouring melody of the sky-lark,

and possessing the same “Frapturous character.

4. Sometim_es, he pitches from the summit of a tree,
begins his song a§,,soon as he gets upon the wing, and
ﬂutters +tremu1o*ii"s’ly;..:¢.:?,d;<;..;vVn to the earth, as if overcome
with ecstasy at his own music. Sometimes he is in pur-
suit of his mate;  ways in full song, as if he would win
her by his *melody*";;'; and always with the same appear-
ance of ‘‘intoxication and delight. Of all the birds of
our groves and meadows, the boblink was the envy of my
boyhood. He crossed my path in the sweetest weather,
and the sweetest season of the year, when all nature
called to the ﬁelds, and the rural feeling throbbed in
every bosom ; but when I, luckless urchin I was doomed
to be mewedgup, during the livelong day, in a school
room.

no school; nothing but holiday, frolic, green ﬁelds, and

might have addressed him in the words of Logan to the

“ Sweet bird, thy bower is ever green,
Thy sky is ever clear;

Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,
No winter in thy year.

“O, could I ﬂy, Pd ﬂy with thee;
VVe’d make, on joyful wing,

Our annual visit round the globe,
Companions of the spring.”

6. Further observation and experience have given me I
‘a different idea of this feathered voluptuary, which I will

venture to ‘“impart, for the beneﬁt of my young readers,
who may regard him _with the same unqualiﬁed envy
and admiration which I once indulged. I have shown
him only as I saw him at ﬁrst, in what I may call the
poetical part of his career, when he, in a manner, devoted
himself to elegant pursuits and enjoyments, and was a

bird of music, and song, and taste, and sensibility, and"

+reﬁnement. While this lasted he was sacred from injury;
the very schoolboy would not ﬂing a stone at him, and
the merest *rustic would pauseto listen to his strain.

7. But mark the difference. As the year advances, as
the clover blossoms disappear, and the spring fades into
summer, he gradually gives up his elegant tastes and
habits, doﬁ's his poetical suit of black, assumes a +russet,
dusty garb, and sinks to the gross enjoyment of common,
vulgar birds. His notes no longer +vibrate on the ear ;
he is stufﬁng himself with the seeds of the tall weeds on
which he lately swung and chanted so melodiously. He
has become a “bon vivant,” a “ gourmand:” with him
now there is nothing like the “joys of the table.” In a
little While, he grows tired of plain, homely fare, and is
off on a gastronomic tour in quest of foreign luxuries.

8. We next hear of him, with myriads of his kind,
lbanqueting among the reeds of the Delaware, and grown
‘Fcorpulent with good feeding. He has changed his name

now, the much—sought—for +titbit of Pennsylvania +epi-

ever he goes, pop! pop! pop! every rusty ﬁrelock in the
country is blazing away. He sees his companions falling
by thousands around him. Does he take warning and
reform? Alas ! not he. Again he wings his ﬂight. The
rice swamps of the south invite him. He gorges him-
self among them almost to bursting; he can scarcely
ﬂy for +corpulency. He has once more changed his
name, and is now the famous rice-bird of the Oarolinas.
Last stage of his career : behold him spitted, with dozens
of his corpulent companions,Aand served up, a vaunted
dish, on some southern table.

9. Such is the story of the boblink; once spiritual,
musical, admired, the joy of the meadows, and the fa-
vorite bird of spring; finally, a gross little +sensualist,
who iexpiates his sensuality in the ‘Flarder. His story
containsamoral,worthy the attention of all little birds
and little boys; warning them to keep to those reﬁned
and intellectual pursuits, which raised him to so high a
pitch of popularity during the early part of his career,
but to ‘teschew all tendency to that gross and dissipated
indulgence, which brought this mistaken little bird to an
untimely end.

1. WE left the +bufl'alo camp about eight o’clock, and
had a toilsome and iharassing march of two hours, over
ridges of hills, covered with pa ragged forest of scrub
oaks, and broken by deep gullies. '

316 NEW FIFTH READER.

2. About ten o’clock in the morning, we came to where
this line of rugged hills swept down into a valley,
through which ﬂowed the north fork of Red river. A
beautiful meadow, about half a mile wide, enameled with
yellow ‘autumnal ﬂowers, stretched for two .;.or. three
miles along the foot of the hills, bordered on the opposite
side by the river, whose banks were fringed with cotton-
wood trees,,the bright foliage of which refreshed and

delighted‘ the eye, after being wearied by the contempla- T.

tion of “Fmonotonous wastes of brown forest.

8. The meadow was ﬁnely idiversiﬁed by groves and
clumps of trees, so happily disposed, that they seemed
as if set out by the hand. of art. As we cast our eyes
over this fresh and deligl;;§ful_,,,,y;al1ey, we beheld a troop
of wild horses, quietly  a green lawn, about a
mile distant, to our right, while to our left, at nearly the
same distance, were several buffaloes; some feeding,
others reposing, and ruminating among the high, rich
herbage, under the shade of" a clump of cotton-wood
trees. The whole had the appearance of a broad, beauti-

ful tract of pasture land, on the highly-ornamented es- ’
tate of some gentleman farmer, with his cattle grazing .

about the lawns and meadows. A
4. A ‘council of war was now held, and it was deter-
mined to proﬁt by the present favorable opportunity,
and try our hand at the grand hunting maneuver, which
is called “ringing the wild horse.” This requires a large
party of horsemen, well mounted. They extend them-
selves in each direction, at a certain distance apart, and
gradually form a ring of two or three miles in *circum-
ference, so as to surround the game. This must be done
with extreme care, for the wild horse is the most readily
alarmed inhabitant of the prairie, and can scent a hun-
ter a great distance, if to windward. _ ’
5. The ring being formed, two or three ride toward
the horses, which start off in an opposite direction.
Whenever they approach the bounds of the ring, how-
ever, a huntsman presents himself, and turns them from
their course. In this way, they are checked, and driven

ECLECTIC SERIES.   317

back at every point, and kept galloping round and
round this "magic circle, until, being "“completely tired
down, it is easy for hunters to ride up beside them, and
throw the lariat over their heads. The prime horses of
the most speed, courage, and bottom however, are apt to
break through and escape,'so that, in general, it is the
second-rate horses that are taken.

6. "Treparations were now made for a hunt of this
kind. The pack horses were now taken into the woods,
and ﬁrmly tied to trees, lest in a rush of wild horses,
they should break away. Twenty—ﬁve men were then
sent under the command of a lieutenant, to steal ‘along
the edge of the valley,‘ within the strip of Wood that
+skii~ted the hills.  were to station themselves
about ﬁfty yards apart,‘w‘it“hin the edge of the woods,
and not advance or show themselves until the horses
dashed in that direction. Twenty-ﬁve men were sent
across the valley, to steal in like manner along the river
bank that bordered the opposite side, and to station
themselves among the trees.

7. A third party of about the same number was to
form a line, stretching across the lower part of the val-
ley, so as to connect the two wings. Beatte and our
other half‘ breed, Antoine, together with the ever officious
Tonish, were to make a +circuit through the woods, so as
to get to the upper part of the valley, in the rear of the
horses, and drivethem forward, into the kind of sack
that we had formed, while the two wings should join
behind them, and make a complete circle.

8. The ﬂanking parties were quietly extending them-
selves out of sight, on each side of the valley, and the
residue were stretching themselves, like the links of a
chain across it, when the wild horses gave signs that
they scented an enemy; snuﬂing the air, snorting, and
looking about. At length, they +pranced off slowly
toward the river, and disappeared behind a green bank.

9. Here, had the regulations of the chase been

observed, they would have been quietly checked and

turned back ‘by the advance of ‘ a hunter from the trees.

318 NEW'FIFTH READER.

““Unluckily, however, we had our +w.ild-ﬁre", Jack-o’lan-
tern, little Frenchman to deal with. Instead of‘ keeping

1 quietly up the right side of the valley, to get above the

horses, the moment he saw them move toward the river,
he broke out of the covert of woods, and dashed furious-
ly across the plain in pursuit of them. This put an end

to all system. The half breeds, and half’ a score of l‘ran- ‘

gers, joined in the chase.

10. Away they all went over the green bank. In a 1

moment or two, the wild horses re-appeared, and came
thundering down the valley, with Frenchman, half
breeds, and rangers, galloping and bellowing behind
them. It was in vain that the line drawn across the
valley, attempted to check, and turn back the fugitives;
they were too hotly pressed by their pursuers: in their
panic they dashed through the line, and "c1attered down
the plain. A

11. The whole troop joined in the headlong chase,
some of the rangers without hats or caps, their hair
ﬂying about their ears, and others with handkerchiefs
tied round their heads. The buffaloes, which had been
calmly ruminating among the herbage, heaved up their
huge forms, gazed for a moment at the tempest that came
scouring down the meadow, then turned and took to
heavy rolling ﬂight. They were soon. overtaken ; the
'*promiscuous throng were pressed together, by the con-
tracting sides of’ the valley, and away they went‘, pell
mell‘, ‘fhurry skurry‘, wild buffalo, wild horse‘, wild
huntsman‘, with clang and clatter‘, and whoop and hallo’,
that made the forests ring‘. A ~

12. At length, the buffaloes turned into a green brake,
on the river bank, while the horses dashed up a narrow
+deﬁle of the hills, with their pursuers close to their
hcels. Beatte passed several of ‘them, having ﬁxed his

young ranger sprang from his horse, and seized her by
the mane and “rmuzzle. Another ranger dismounted, and
came to his assistance. The mare struggled ﬁercely,
kicking and biting, and striking with her fore feet, but
a noose was slipped over her head, and her struggles
were 111 vain. V

14. It was some time, however, before she gave over
rearing and plunging, and lashing out with her feet on
every side. The two rangers then led her along the
valley, by two strong lariats, which enabled them to
keep at a sufﬁcient distance on each side, to be out of the
reach of her hoofs, and whenever she struck out in one
direction, she was jerked in the other. In this way her
spirit was gradually ‘Fsubdued.

15. As to Tonish, who had marred the whole scheme
by his Tpreeipitancy, he had been more successful than
he deserved, having managed to catch a beautiful cream
colored colt about seven months old, that had not
strength tokeep up with its companions. The mercurial
little Frenchman was beside himself with iexultation.
It was amusing to see him with his prize. The colt would
rear and kick, and struggle to get free, when Tonish
would take him about the neck, wrestle with him, jump
on his back, and out as many antics as a monkey with a
kitten.

16. Nothing surprised me more, however, than to wit-
ness how soon these poor animals, thus taken from the
unbounded freedom of the prairie, yielded to the domin-
ion of man. In the course of two or three days, the
mare and colt went with the lead horses, and became
quite idocile. W

Tell her the last night of my life-—(for, ere the moon be risen,
My body will be out of pain, my soul be out of prison),

On the vineclad hills of Bingen, fair Bingen on the Rhine!

The German songs we used to sing in chorus sweet and clear ;

And down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill,

The +echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm and

And her glad blue eyes were on me, as we passed with friendly
talk: ~

The soldier of the Legion in a foreign land was dead!
And the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down
On the red sand of the battle-ﬁeld, with bloody corses strewn !
Yes, calmly on, that dreadful scene, her pale light seemed to

As it shone on distant Bingen, fair Bingen on the Rhine.

1. OUR happiness is in the power of One, who can
bring it about in a thousand unforeseen ways, that mock
our foresight. If example be necessary to prove this, I

will give you a story, told us by a grave, though some- -

times romancing, +historian. _

2. “Matilda was married, very young, to a Neapolitan
nobleman of the ﬁrst ‘quality, and found herself a widow
and a mother, at the age of ﬁfteen. As she stood, one
day, +caressing her infant son, in the open window of an
apartment which hung over the river Volturnus, the
child, with a sudden spring, leaped from her arms into
the ﬂood below, and disappeared in a moment. The
mother, struck with instant surprise, and making an
effort to save him, plunged in after ; but, far from being
ableto assist the infant, she herself, with great difficulty,
escaped to the opposite shore, just when some French
soldiers were plundering the country on that side, who
immediately made her their prisoner. ,

3. “As the war was then carried on between the
French and Italians, with the utmost inhumanity, they
were going, at once, to take her life. This base +resolu-
tion, however, 'was opposed by a young officer, who,
though their retreat required the utmost expedition,
placed herbehind him, and carried her in safety to her
native city. Her beauty, at ﬁrst, caught his eye, her
merit, soon after, his heart. ‘They were married: he

ECLECTIC sERIEs 323

rose to the highest posts: they lived long together, and
were happy. But .the felicity of a soldier can never be
called permanent. After an “‘“interval of several years,
the troops which he commanded having met with a
repulse, he was obliged to take shelter in the city where
he had lived with his wife. Here they suffered a siege,
and the city, at length, was taken.

4. “Few histories can produce more various instances
of cruelty, than those which the French and Italians, at
that time, exercised upon each other. It was resolved by
the victors, upon this occasion, to put all the French
prisoners to death; but particularly the husband of
the unfortunate Matilda, as he was principally +instru-
mental in -rprotracting the siege. Their determinations
were, in general, executed almost as soon as resolved
upon.

5. “The captive soldier was led forth, and the execu-
tioner, with his sword, stood ready, while the spectators,
in gloomy silence, awaited the fatal blow, which was only
suspended till the general, who presided as judge, should
give the signal. It was in this interval of anguish and
expectation, that Matilda came to take her last farewell
of her husband and deliverer, deploring her wretched
situation, and the ‘“cruelty of fate, that had saved her
from perishing, by a premature death, in the river Vol-
turnus to be the spectator of still greater +calamities.

6. “The general, who was a young man, was struck
with surprise at her beauty, and pity at her distress;
but with still stronger emotions, when he heard her

mention her former dangers. He was her son; the in-

fant, for whom she had *“encountered so much danger.
He acknowledged her, at once, as his mother, and fell at
her feet. The rest may be easily supposed. The captive

' was set free, and all the happiness that love, friendship,

and duty could confer on each, was enjoyed.”

SPEECH OF LOGAN, CHIEF OF THE MINGOES.

consonant of any Word is joined to the vowel of the next Word.

ARTICULATE distinctly. Do not say who Zof, for whole of ; cm
dindeed, for and indeed; eminen tomtors, for eminent orators;

brated in peace and War.

1. I MAY +challenge the Whole of the orations of De-
mosthenes and Cicero, and indeed, of any more erfiinent
orators, if’ Europe or the World, has furnished more
eminent, to produce a single passage superior to the
speech of Logan, a Mingo chief, delivered to L_ord Dun-
more, When governor of Virginia. As a ‘'“testimony
of Indian talents in this line, I beg leave to introduce
it, by ﬁrst stating the +incidents necessary for under-
standing it. , .

2. In the spring of the year 1774, a robbery was com-
mitted by some Indians, upon certain land adventurers
on the Ohio river. The Whites in that quarter, according
to their custom, undertook to punish this outrage in a
summary Way. Captain Michael Cresap and one
Daniel Grreathouse, leading" on these parties, surprised,
at different times, traveling and hunting parties of the
Indians, who had their Women and children with them,
and murdered many. Among these, Were "unfortunately
the family of Logan, a chief celebrated in peace and War,
and long ‘distinguished as the friend of the Whites.

3. This unworthy return provoked his +vengeance.
He accordingly signalized himself in the War which
ensued. In the autumn of the same year, a *decisive

ECLECTIC SERIES. 325

battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanawha,
between the collected forces of the Shawnees, the Min-
goes, and the Delawares, and a detachment of the Vir-
ginia militia. The Indians were defeated, and sued for
peace. Logan,‘hoWever, tdisdained to be seen among
the "tsuppliants : but, lest the “tsincerity of a treaty, from

I Which so distinguished a chief absented himself, should

be distrusted, he sent, by a messenger, the following
speech to be delivered to Lord Dunmore.

-4. “I appeal to any White man to say, if ever he en-
tered Logan’s cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat;
if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not.
During the course of the last long and bloody War, Logan
remained idle in his cabin, an "“advocate for peace. Such
Was my love for the Whites, that my countrymen pointed
as they passed, and said "Logan is the friend of the
White men.’ I had even thought to live With you, but
for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, last spring,
in cold blood, and ‘Punprovoked, murdered all the +rela-
tives of Logan, not sparing even my Women and children.
There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any
living creature. This called on me for revenge. ,_I have
sought it. I have killed many. I have fully “Fglutted
my “’vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams
of peace: but do not +harbor a thought that mine is the
joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He Will not turn
on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for
Logan? Not one.” '

QUESTIONS. ———Who was Demosthenes? Cicero? Who undertook to
punish the Indians? Whose family were killed? Where Was a de-
cisive battle fought? Where does the Kanawha rise? Why did not
Logan appear among the suppliants?

Which the attribute? See Pinneo’s Analytical Grammar.

PARRHASIUS.

REMARK.-——The tones of the voice and the manner of reading should
correspond with the nature of the subject. -

[The following is a very difficult sketch to read expressively. The
old man dying under torture, and the painter striving to catch the
expression of his countenance, and to transfer it to the canvas, are
the two objects before the mind. The painter is sometimes talking to
himself, sometimes directing his servant, and sometimes replying to
the groansvand entreaties of the dying man, and, in each of these
characters, his supposed manner of expression is to be imitated]

“Parrhasius, a painter of Athens, bought one of those Olynthian
captives which Philip of Macedon brought home to sell; and, when he
had him at his house, put him to death with extreme torture and tor-
ment, the better by his example, to express the pains and passions of
his Prometheus, which he was then about to paint.”

In the fables of the ancients, Prometheus is represented as being,
by the command of the gods, chained to the rocks» of Mount Caucasus,
and surrounded by vultures, which are constantly devouring his liver.
This, however, grows‘ again as fast as it is eaten, so that he is thus
continually enduring the agonies of death, but never dies. It was
this Prometheus, thus chained and tortured, that Parrhasius was
attempting to paint, and the old man, his captive, was tortured to
death, that the painter might copy the expression given by extreme
pain to the countenance.

1. PARRHASIUS stood, gazing forgetfully
Upon his +canvas. There Prometheus lay,
Chained to the cold rocks of Mount Caucasus,
The vultures at his Vitals, and the links

“ Bring me the captive now:
My hand feels skillful, and the shadows lift

And I could paint the bow

MARTYN AND BYRON.

1. BOTH Henry Martyn and Lord Byron shared
the sorrows of life, and their records teach the differ-
ent workings of the Christian and the worldly mind.
Byron lost his mother, and when urged 11ot to give way

H to sorrow, «he burst into an agony of grief, saying, “I

had but one friend in the world, and now she is gone!”
On the death of some of his early friends, he thus writes:
“My friends fall around me, and I shall be left a lonely
tree before I am withered. I have no +resource but my
own reﬂeetions, and they present no prospect here or
hereafter, except the selﬁsh satisfaction of surviving my
betters. I am indeed most wretched.” . ' l

2. And thus Henry Martyn mourns the loss of one
most dear: “ Can it be that she has been lying so many

months in the cold grave? Would that I could always
remember it, or always forget it; but to think a moment
on other things, and then feel the remembrance of it
come, as if for the ﬁrst time, rends my heart +asunder.
Oh my gracious God, what should I do without Thee!
But now thou art manifesting thyself as ,‘the God of
all consolation.’ Never was I so near thee. There is
nothing in the "world for which I could wish to live,
except because it may please God to appoint me some
work to do. Oh thou incomprehensibly glorious Savior,
what hast thou done to alleviate the sorrows of life!”

3. It is recorded of Byron, that, in society, he gen-
erally appeared humorous and prankish; yet, when
”‘"rallied on his melancholy turn of writing, his constant
answer was, that though thus merry and full of laugh-
ter, he was, at heart, one of the most miserable wretches
in existence.

4. And thus he writes: “Why, at the very hight of
desire, and human pleasure, worldly, amorous, ambi-
tious, or even avaricious, does there imingle a certain
sense of doubt and sorrow, a fear of what is to come, a.
doubt of what is? If it were not for hope, what would
the future be? A hell! As for the past, what predomi-
nates in memory? Hopes bafﬂed! From whatever
place we commence, we know where it must all end. And
yet what good is there in knowing it? It does not
make men wiser or better. If I were to live over again,
I do not know-what I would change in myglife, unless it
were for not to have lived at all. All history and ‘“expe-
rience teach us, that good and evil are pretty equally
balanced in this exi_stence, and that what is most to be
desired, is an easy passage out of it. VVhat can it give us
but years, and these have little of good but their ending.”

5. And thus Martyn writes: “I am happier here in
this remote-land, where I seldom hear what happens in
the world, than I was in England, where there are so
many calls to look atgthings that are seen. The precious
.Word is now my only study, by means of ‘rtranslations.
Time ﬂows on with great rapidity. It seems as if life

would all be gone before any thing is done. I some-
times rejoice that I am but twenty-seven, and that,
unless God should ordain it otherwise, I may double this
number in constant and 7‘successful labor. But I shall
not cease from my happiness, and scarcely from my
labor, by passing into the other world.”

6. And thus they make their records at anniversa-
ries, when the, mind is called to review life and its
labors. Thus Byron writes, “ At twelve o’clock I shall
have completed thirty—three years! I go to my bed with

a heaviness of heart at having lived so long and to so .

little purpose. * * It is now three minutes past twelve,
and I am thirty—three !

‘ Alas, my friend, the years pass swiftly by.’

But I do not regret them so much for what I have
done, as for what I might have done.”

7. And thus Martyn: “I like to ﬁnd myself em.-
ployed usefully, in away I did not expect or foresee.
The coming year is to be a +perilous one, but my life is
of little consequence, whether I ﬁnish the Persian New
Testament or not. I look back with pity on myself,
when I attached so much importance tomy life and
labors. The more I see of my own works, the more I

And kings to do him honor took delight.

Thus full of titles, +ﬁattery, honor, fame;

Beyond desire, beyond ambition full,

He died; he died of what? Of +wretchedness.
Drank every cup of joy, heard every trump

Of fame: drank early, deeply drank; drank +draughts
That common millions might have quenched, then died
Of thirst, because there was no more to drink.

His goddess nature, wooed, embraced, enjoyed,
Fell from his arms +abhorred; his passion died;
Died, all but dreary, solitary pride:

And all his +sympathies in being died.

6. As some ill-guided bark, well built and tall,

Which angry tides cast on our desert shore,

And then retiring, leave it there to’ rot i

And molder in the winds and rains of heaven ;

So he, cut from the Tsympathies of life,

And cast ashore from pleasure’s boisterous surge,
A wandering, weary, worn, and wretched thing,
Scorched, and +desolate, and blasted soul,

A gloomy ‘‘“wilderness of dying thought,

Repined, and groaned, and withered from the earth.

ECLECTIG SERIES. 335

This longing after ‘immortality?

Or whence this secret dread and inward horror,
Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul
Back on herself, and startles at +destruction?
’Tis the divinity that stirs within us !

’Tis heaven itself that points out an hereafter,
And intimates ieternity to man.

2. Eternity, thou pleasing, dreadful thought!

Through what +variety of untried being,

Through what new scenes and changes must we pass?
The wide unbounded prospect lies before me :

But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.

Here will I hold. If there’s a Power above us,

(And that there is all Nature cries aloud

Through all her works) he must delight in virtue;
And that which he delights in must be happy.

But when? or where? This world was made for Caesar.

By this, thestorm grew loud apace,
The water wraith was shrieking;
And, in the scowl of heaven, each face
Grew dark as they were speaking.

But still, as wilder grew the wind
And as the night grew drearer,

Adown the glen rode arm—ed men,

" Their trampling sounded nearer,

“ O haste thee, haste 1” the lady cries,
“ Though tempests round us gather;
I ’ll meet the raging of the skies,
But not an angry father.”

- The boat has left the stormy land,
A stormy sea before her;
When, oh! too strong for human hand,
The tempest‘ gathered o’e‘r her.

And still they rowed, amid the roar
Of waters fast prevailing; A

Lord Ullin reached that fatal shore,
His wrath was changed to wailing.

For sore dismayed through storm and shade,
His child he ‘did discover;

One lovely hand she stretched for aid,
And one was round her lover.

“ Come back! come back 1” he cried, in grief,
“ Across this stormy water:
And I ’ll forgive your Highland chief;
My daughter! oh, my daughter!” -

’ T was vain: the loud waves lashed the shore,
Return or aid preventing:

The waters wild, went o’er his child,
And he was left lamenting.

1. IN a ﬁne forest of trees of ‘various kinds, there
Were several which Were holding a +conversation upon

another.

2. One of the tallest and ﬁnest trees said proudly,
“Which of you, my friends, is so tall and straight as I
am? I am the stateliest tree in the forest.”

3. Another one said, “Which of you is so strong as I
am? I have stood in the storm for years, and no beast
has been able to bend or break me down. I am the

Its root was like a thread,

Then out it freely spread :
On this side and on that side
It grappled with the ground ; ,
And in the +ancient,- rifted rock,
Its ﬁrmest footing found.

1. “Ir must be, my child,” said the poor widow,
wiping away the tears which slowly itrickled down her
wasted cheeks. “There is no other resource. I am too
sick to work, and you can not surely see me and your
little brother starve.”   A

2. The boy, a noble looking little fellow of abou
ten years, started up, and after throwing his arms
around his mother’s neck, left the house without a word.
He did not hear the groan of +anguish that was uttered
by his parent, as thedoor closed behind him; and it was
well that he did not, for his little heart was ready to
burst without it. y . ‘

3. It was a by-street inm,1,?l1iladelphia, and as he
walked to and fro on the sidewalk, he looked ﬁrst at
one person and then at another, as they passed him ; but
no one seemed to look kindly on him, and the longer he
waited, the faster his courage dwindled away. The
tears were running fast down his cheeks, but ‘nobody
seemed to care; for although clean, Henry looked poor

and +miserable, and it is common for the poor and mis-
erable to cry.

4. Every body seemed in a hurry, and the poor boy
was quite in +despair, when at last he espied a gentle-
man who seemed to be very +leisur_ely taking a morning
walk. He was dressed in black, wore a three-cornered
hat, and had a pleasant +countenance. When Henry

Vlooked at him, he felt all his fears ‘"vanish at once, and   s

instantly approached him.

5. His tears had been ﬂowing so long, that his eyes
were quite red and swollen, and his voice trembled; but
that was with weakness, _for he had not eaten for
twenty-four hours. As Henry, ‘with a low faltering
voice, begged for a little +charity, ; the gentleman
stopped;_and his kind heart melted with +compassion,
as he looked into the fair countenance of the poor boy,
and saw the deep +blush which spread over his face, and
listened to the modest, humble tones, which “'accompa-
nied his ‘tpetition. , i - '

‘6. “You do not look like a boy who has been *accus-
tomed to beg his bread,” said he, laying his hand kindly
on the boy’s shoulder; “What has driven you to this
step?” i i

7. “Indeed,” answered Henry, his tears beginning to
ﬂow afresh, “indeed, I was not born in this :condition.
But the misfortunes of my father, and the sfckness of
my mother, have driven me to this step.”

8. “JWho is your father?” inquired the ‘ gentleinaii,
still more +interested.

9. “My father was a rich merchant of this city; but

he became bondsman for a friend, who soon after ‘tfailed, ’

not had the courage to go to any of my mother’s old
+acquaintances, and tell them that she has come to need

charity. I thought you looked like a stranger, sir, and,

something in your face overcame my shame, and gave
me courage to speak to you. Oh, sir, do pity my poor
mother.”

12. The tears, and the simple, moving language of the
poor boy, touched a chord in the breast of the stranger,
which was accustomed to frequent vibrations.

13. “Where does your mother live, my boy?” said he
in a husky voice: “is it far from here?”

14. “She lives in the last house on this street, sir,”
replied Henry. “You can see it from here in the third
block, and on the left hand side.”

15. “Have you sent for a +physician ?”

16. “No, sir,” said the boy, “I had no money, to pay
either for a physician or for +medicine.”

17. “Here,” said the stranger, drawing some pieces of
money from his pocketr——“here are three dollars; take
them and run immediately for a physician.”

18. IIenry’s eyes ﬂashed with ‘gratitude; he received
theimoney with a ‘tstammering and almost inaudible

' voice; but with a look of the warmest gratitude he van- 1

ished.
19. The ibenevolent stranger instantly sought the

dwelling of the sick widow. He entered at little room‘, .

in which he could see nothing but a few implements of
female labor, a miserable table, an old ‘bureau, and a
little bed which stood in one corner, on which the inva-
lid lay. She appeared weak, and almost ‘exhausted’;
and on the bed, at her feet, sat a little boy, crying as if
his heart would break. ,_

20. Deeply moved at this sight,"the stranger drew
near the bedside of the invalid, and, ifeigning to be a
physician, inquired into the nature of her ’'disease. The

widow, with a deep sigh, added, “ Oh, my sickness has a

21. “I am a mother, a wretched mother. I see my

I have no means of relieving. My sickness is of the

even death is dreadful to me,’for it awakens the thought

22. Here ‘temotion checked her “tutterance, and the
tears ﬂowed +unrestrained down her cheeks. But the
pretended physician spoke so consolingly to her, and
+manifested so warm a ‘Fsympathy for her condition,
that the heart of the poor woman ‘tthrobbed with a

 

- pleasure that was unwonted.

23. “Do not despair,” said the stranger, “think only
of recovery, and of preserving alife that is so precious
to your children. Can I Write a prescription here?”

24. The poor widow took a little prayer book from
the hands of the child who sat with her on the bed, and,
tearing out a blank leaf, “I have no other,” said she,
“but perhaps this will do.”

25. The stranger took a pencil from his pocket, and
Wrote a few lines upon the paper.

26. “This prescription,” said he, “you will ﬁnd of ,

great service to you. If it is necessary, I will write you
a second. I have great hopes of your recovery.”

27. He laid the paper on the table, and departed.
Scarcely was he gone, when the elder son returned.

+aﬁ'ectionately kissing her. “See what a kind, benevo-

30. Henryglanced at the paper and started back. He

3 took it up, and as he read it through again and again, a

cry of wonder and astonishment escaped him.

31. “ What is it‘, my son’?” exclaimed the poor
widow, trembling with an +apprehension—of she knew
not—what.

32. “ Ah, read, dear mother! God has heard us.”

33. The mother took the paper from the hand of her
son, but no sooner had she ﬁxed her eyes upon it, than
she exclaimed, “ It is Washington!” and fell back faint-
ing on her pillow. V ~

34. The writing was an obligation from VVashington‘
-—-for it was indeed he’—-—by which the widow was to
receive the sum of one hundred dollars from his own
private ‘*property, to be doubled in case of necessity.

35. Meanwhile, the expected physician made his ap-

1: on a dark, cold night, in the middle of November,

as Mr. Lawrence was traveling in a stage coach from Q

London to Norwich, he was roused from a sound sleep,

ECLECTIC SERIES. 47

at the end of the stage, by the coachman’s opening the
door of the_ carriage, and begging leave to look ‘for a
parcel which was in the box under Mr. Lawrence’s seat.

2. The opening of the door admitted a violent gust of
wind and rain, which was very unpleasant to the feel-
ing of the sleeping +passengers, and roused them to a
consciousness of the “'situation of those who were on the
outside of the vehicle.

3. “I hope, coachman, you have a good thick coat on,
to guard you against the cold and wet,” said Mr. Law-
rence. “I have a very good one, sir,” replied the man,
“but I have lent it to a poor little girl we have on the
top; for my heart bled for her, poor thing, she had so
little clothing to keep her warm.’,’ I ‘

4. “A child exposed on the outside of the coach, on
such a night as this!” exclaimed Mr. Lawrence. “I am
sure it would be very wrong in us to let her stay there.
Do let us have her in ‘Fimmediately. It is quite +shock-
ing to think of her being in such a situation.”

5. “Oh, no,” cried a gentleman opposite, “ we can do
nothing with her. It is quite out of the question. The
coach is already full, and she will be so wet, that we
might as well be on the outside ourselves, as sit near her.
Beside, she is a poor child, in charge of the master of a
workhouse, and one does not know what she may have
about her.” I ‘

6. “Why, as to that, sir,” replied the coachman, “I be-
lieve she is as clean as any child needs to be, though she

. is rather idelicate looking, poor thing! But she is a ﬁne

little creature, and deserves better fare than she is likely
to get where she is going.”

7. “Let her come in, at any rate,” said Mr. Lawrence,
“for poor or rich, she is equally “sensible to cold, and
no one, I am sure, who has a child of his own, can bear
the idea of her being so exposed. And as to her‘ being
wet, I will wrap her in my plaid, and take her on my
knee, so that no one can feel any ﬁnconvenience from it.”

8. This silenced the gentleman’s ‘fobjection-‘s’;  the

rest of the company agreeing to it, the coachmarn-i

desired to bring the child in, Which he gladly did, and
the dry plaid being rolled about her, Mr. Lawrence took
her upon his knee, and putting his arm around her,
clasped her with +benevolence and self-satisfaction to his
breast. “I am afraid you are very cold, my poor little
girl,” said he.

9. “I was very cold, indeed, till the coachman was so
good to me as to let me have his coat,” replied she, in a

very sweet and cheerful voice; “but you have made me I

warmer still,” she added, and as she spoke, she laid her
head against the breast of her benevolent friend,‘ and
was asleep in a few minutes.

10. “The coachman showed a great deal of +eoncern
for her,” said one of the passengers; “I could hardly
haye expected so much feeling in the driver of a stage
coach.” “I believe there is much more humanity among
the lower classes of people, than is generally supposed,”
said Mr. Lawrence, “for we seldom meet with one who
is deaf to the appeals of childhood or +helplessness.”

11. His companion was too sleepy to dispute the
point, and the whole party soon sunk into the same
state of torpor, from which this little incident had
roused them, and from which they were only +occasion-
ally disturbed’ by the changing of horses, or the coach-
man’s ‘''application for their ‘usual fee, till the full dawn
of day induced them to shake off their ‘fdrowsiness.

12. When” Mr. Lawrence awoke, he found that his
little companion was still in a deep sleep, and he
thought, with satisfaction, of the sound rest he had pro-

cured for her, with only a very little ﬁnconvenience to ‘

himself. He was glad, too, that he had interested him-
self for her before he saw her; for had he seen the
‘tprcpossessing face which he then beheld, he might have
suspected that his ﬁnterference had been prompted by
her beauty as much as by her distress.

e 13. She was of a fair complexion and regular features ;“

but Mr. Lawrence was particularly interested in her
sensible and expressive countenance, which indicated
extreme sweetness of disposition. “What a pity,”

ECLECTIC SERIES. 49

thought he, as he looked at her, “that so promising a
little creature should be conﬁned to the “Fcharity of a
poor house, and there reared in vice and ignorance! ”

14. As these thoughts passed across his mind, the little

girl awoke, and looked around her, as if. at a loss ‘to
know where she was ; but, at the next moment, seeming

to +recollect herself, and looking in Mr. Lawrence’s face,

she returned his kindness by a smile of satisfaction.
“Have you had a good sleep, my dear?” asked he,
kindly. “Yes, sir, I have been sleeping very soundly,
and I thought I was at home.”

15. “Where is your home?” asked Mr. Lawrence.-

“I call where my Aunt Mary used to live my home.”
“And where did your Aunt Mary live?” “I do not
know what they called the place, but it was at the end
of a long lane, and there was a pretty garden before the
house. It was such .a nice place; I am sure you would
like it if you saw it.”  

16. “ Do you know the name of the place? ” “ No, sir,
I do not know what they call it; only that it was Aunt
Mary’s house, and it was near the large town they call
Essex, Where my father lived, and where there were a
great many ships, and a large river.”

17. - Surprised at the easy and correct manner in which
this little girl, who bore marks of nothing but the great-
est poverty, expressed herself, Mr. Lawrenoe’s ““curiosity
was greatly excited, and feeling much interested respect-
ing her, he asked her name.

18. “ My Aunt Mary used to call me Fanny Edwards,”
replied she, “but my new mother told me I must say my
name is Peggy Short, but I do not like that name."

19. “Why did she tell you to call yourself by that
name?” asked Mr. Lawrence. “I can not tell you, sir,

‘for she used to call me Fanny herself till she took me to

thelarge town that we came to yesterday; and then
she called me Peggy, and said I must call myself so.” ,

20. “Where is your Aunt Mary now? And your new
mother, as you call her, where is she gone?”

21. “My Aunt Mary Went away a long time since.
5th R.-4-5 A

50   »NEW FIFTH READER.

She said she was forced to go to a lady who was ill, that
had been very kind to her ; but she would come back to
me soon, and then I should live with her again, and that
I must love her till she came back, and I have loved her
all this time very dearly, but she has never come again.”
As the child said this, her little heart swelled, and her
eyesﬁlled with tears.

22. “Where did you go when she left you? ” +inquired

Mr. Lawrence. “I went to live with my father; for I .

had a new mother, my Aunt Mary said, who would take
care of me. But my father went away in a ship, and my
new mother said he was drowned in the sea, and would

never come back again ; and then she was not very kind

to me ; not so very kind as.my Aunt Mary used to be;
for my Aunt Mary never beat me, but used to take me
upon her knee, and tell me pretty stories, and teach me
the way to read them myself, that I might learn to be a
useful woman ; and used to kiss me, and say she loved
me very dearly when I was a good girl.”

23. “And I hope you were always a good girl,” said
Mr. Lawrence, patting her cheek. “No, sir,” said she,
“I was not always good, for once I told a story, and my
Aunt Mary did not love me for a great many days, and
I was very unhappy.” “ That was indeed bad, but you
will never tell another story, I trust.”

24. “I hope not,” said the child +modestly; and Mr.
Lawrence, +desirous'of knowing something more of her
history, asked her again what had become of her mother.
“ I do not know what has become ofher, but I am afraid
she has lost herself, for when we got to the large town,
she told me to sit down upon a door step, until she came
back to me-. I sat a very long time, till it was quite
dark, and I was very cold and hungry, and ,she never
came to me, and;I could not help crying. The lady that
lived in the house heard me,.asked me what was the
matter; and when I told her, she took me into the
kitchen, and gave me something toeat, and was very
kind to me.”

25. At this simple ‘rnarrative, the passengers were all

HECLECTIC SERIES. 51

much affected. Even the gentleman who had‘ ﬁrst ‘rop-
posed her coming into the coach, rubbed his hand
across his eyes and said, “Poor thing, poor thing,” while
Mr. Lawrence pressed her more closely toward him, and
rejoiced that Providence had thrown in his way, this
sweet little girl, whom he resolved to adopt and add to

. his own happy family.

As the tear stole down from his half shut eye,
Don’t smoke!” said the child, “ how it makes you cry!"

3. The house dog lay, stretched out on the floor,
Wliere the shade, afternoons, used to steal;
The busy old wife by the open door
Wa-s turning the spinning wheel,
And the old brass clock on the mantletree,
Had plodded along to almost three.

4. Still the farmer sat in his easy chair,

While close to his heaving breast,

The moistened brow and the cheek so fair
Of his sweet grandchild were pressed ;

His head bent down, on her soft hair lay;

Fast asleep were they both on that summer day.

1. “ OH, mother, now that I have lost my limb, I can
never be a soldier or a sailor; I can never go round the
world!” And Hugh burst into tears, now more really
:+afﬁicted' than he had ever been yet. His mother sat on
the bed beside him, and wiped away his tears as they
ﬂowed, while he told her, as well as his sobs would let

» him, how long and how much he had reckoned on going

round the world, and how little he cared for any thing
else in future; and now this was the very thing he
should never be able to do!

2. He had practiced climbing ever since he could’
remember, and now this was of no use; he had +prac-  

ticed marching, and now he should never march again.

' “Then he had ﬁnished his complaint, there was a pause,

and his mother said,
?‘ Hugh, you have heard of Huber.”

54 NEW FIFTH READER.

“ The man who found out so much about bees?” said
Hugh. ‘ _
,_ “Bees and ants. When Huber had discovered more
than had ever been known about these, and when he
was sure’ that he‘ could learn still more, and was more
and more anxious to peep into their tiny homes, and
curious ways, he became blind.” E
3. Hugh sighed, and his mother went on.

“Did you ever hear of Beethoven? He was one of

the greatest +musical composers that ever lived. sHis
great, his sole delight, was in music. It was the passion
of his life. When all his time and all his mind were
given to music, he suddenly became deaf, perfectly deaf;
so that he never more -heard one single note from the
loudest orchestra. While crowds Were moved and de-
lighted with his compositions, it was all silence to him.”
Hugh said nothing. ‘ ,

4. “Now do you think,” asked his mother—and Hugh
saw that a mild and gentle smile +beamed from her
countenance——-“do you think that these people were
without a heavenly Parent?” H .

“Oh no! but were they patient?” asked Hugh.

“Yes, in their different ways and +degrees. Would
you suppose, that they were hardly treated? Or would
you not rather suppose, that their Father gave them
something better to do, "than they had planned for them-
selves?”

5. “He must know best, of course; but it does seem
very hard, that that very thing should happen to them.

  Huber would not have so much minded being deaf} per-

haps ; or that musical man being blind.”

“No doubt their hearts often swelled within them, at
their +disappointments; but I fully believe that they
very soon found God’s will to be wiser than their wishes.
They found, if they bore their trial well, that there was
work for their hearts to do, far nobler than any the
head could do through the eye, or the ear. And they
soon felt a new and delicious pleasure, which none but
the bitterly disappointed can feel.”

“What is that?’

ECLECTIC SERIES. 55

I!

6. “The pleasure of rousing the soul to bear pain, and
of agreeing with God silently, when nobody knows what
is in the breast. There is no pleasure like that of l'6XeI'-
cising one’s soul in bearing pain, and of ﬁnding one’s
heart glow with the hope that one is pleasing God.”

“Shall I feel that pleasure?”

“Often and often, I have no doubt: every time you
can willingly give up your wish to be a soldier, or a
sailor, or any thing else you have set your mind upon,
you will feel that pleasure. But I do not expect it of
you yet. I dare say, it was long a bitter thing to Beet-
hoven to see hundreds of people in raptures with his
music, when he could not hear a note of it.”

7. “But did he ever smile again?” asked Hugh.

“If he did, he was happier than all the ﬁne music in’
the world could have made liim,” replied his mother.

“I wonder, oh, I wonder if I shall ever feel so!”

“VVe will pray to God that you may. Shall we ask
him now?” .

Hugh clasped his hands. His mother kneeled beside
the bed, and, in a very few words, prayed that Hugh
might be able to bear his "tmisfortune well,'and that his
friends might give him such help and comfort as God
should approve.

8. ,Hugh found himself subject to very painful feelings.

sometimes, such as no one quite understood, and such as
he feared no one was able to pity as ‘they deserved. On
one *occasion, when he had been quite merry for a while,
and his mother and sister Agnes were chatting, they
thought they heard a sob from the sofa. They spoke to
Hugh, and found that he was indeed crying bitterly.
“What is it, my dear,” said his mother. “Agnes,
have we said any thing that could hurt his feelings?”

“No, no,” sobbed Hugh. “I will tell you presently.” if

'9. And presently he toldathem, that he was so busy
listening to what they said, that he forgot every thing
else, when he felt as if something got between two of
his toes; “funconsciously he put down his hand, as if his
foot was there! Nothing could be plainer than the feel-
ing in his toes; and, then, when he put out his hand,

56 NEW FIFTH READER.

and founcf nothing, it W as so terrible! it startled him so!
It Was a comfort to ﬁnd that his mother knew about
this. She came, and kneeled by his sofa, and told him
that many persons who had lost a limb, considered this
the most painful thing they had to bear, for some time;
but that, though the feeling would return occasionally
through life, it Would cease to be painful.

10. Hugh Was very much dejected, and When ‘he

thought of themonths and years, to the end‘ of his life, ~

and that he should never run and play, and never be
like other people, he almost Wished that he was dead.

Agnes thought that he must be ‘tmiserable indeed, if
he could venture to say this to his mother. She glanced
at her mother’s face, but there Was no +displeasure there.
On the contrary, she said this feeling was very natural.
She had felt it herself, under smaller misfortunes than
Hugh’s; but she had found, though the prospect appears
all strewn With troubles, that they come singly, and are
not so hard to bear, after all.

11. She told Hugh, that when she was a little girl, she
Was very lazy, fondof her bed, and not at all fond of
dressing or Washing. ‘

“Why, mother! you?” exclaimed Hugh.

“Yes; that was the sort of little girl I Was. Well, I
was in +despair, one day, at the thought that I should
have to Wash and clean my teeth, and brush my hair,
and put on every article of dress, every morning as long
as I lived.”

“Did you tell any body?” asked Hugh.

12. “No; I was ashamed to do that; but I remember
I cried. You see how it turns out. When We have be-
come ‘‘accustomed to any thing, we do it Without ever

I thinking of the trouble, and, as the old fable tells us, the

clock, that has to tick so many millions of times, has
exactly the same number of seconds to do it in. So will
you ﬁnd, that you can move about on each '*separate
occasion, as you Wish, and practice Will enable you to do
it Without any trouble or thought.” ,

“ But this is not all, nor half What I mean,” said Hugh.

JEOTIC SERIES. 57

13. “ No, my dear, nor half what you will have to bear.
You resolved to bear it all ‘tpatiently, I remember. But
what is it you dread the most? ”

“ Oh! all manner of things. I can never do like other
people.”

“Some things,” replied his mother. “You can never
play cricket, as every Crofton boy would like to do.
You can never dance at your sisters Christmas parties.”

14. “ Oh! mamma ! ” cried Agnes, with tears in her
eyes, and with the thought in her mind, that it was cruel
to talk so. I

“Go on!. Go on!” cried Hugh, brightening. “You
know what I feel, mother; and you do n’t keep telling
me, as others do, and even sister Agnes, sometimes, that
it will not +signify much, and that I shall not care, and
all that; making out that it is no misfortune, hardly,
when I know what it is, and they do n’t. Now then, go
on, mother! What else?”

15. “There will be little checks and +mortiﬁcations
+continually, when you see little boys leaping over this,
and climbing that, and playing at the other, while you
must stand out, and can only look on. And some people
willpity you, in a way you will not like: and some may
even laugh at you.”

“ Oh mamma I ” exclaimed Agnes.

“Well, and what else? ” said Hugh. .

16. “ Sooner or later, you will have to follow some way
of life determined by this ‘taccident, instead of one that
you would have liked better.’ A

“Well, what else?” A

“I must ask you, now. I can think of nothing more ;
and I hope there is not much else; for, indeed, I think
here is quite enough for a boy, or any one else, to bear.”

“ I will bear it, though ; you will see.”

17. “You will ﬁnd great helps. ‘ These misfortunes, of
themselves strengthen one’s mind. They have some
‘*advantages, too. You will be a better scholar for your
lameness, I have no doubt. You will read ‘more books,
and have a mind richer in thoughts". You will be more

beloved by us all, and you yourself will love God more
for having given you something to bear for his sake.
God himself will help you to bear your trials. You Will
conquer your troubles one by one, and by a *succession

over all.”

Whispering, “God will keep my child.”

2. She was youthful then, and sprightly,

Fondly on my father leaning,

Sweet she spoke, hereyes shone +brightly,
And her words were full of meaning;

Now, an Autumn leaf decayed,

I, perhaps, have made itlfade.

Mother’, in them all I share‘;
In thy sickness watch beside thee,
And beside thee kneel in prayer.
Best of mothers’! on my breast’
Lean thy head, and sink to rest.

that any should groan or sigh at pain‘. His mind was
vigorous, like his body‘; he was +perpleXed at no intri-
cacy; he was. daunted ‘at no difficulty‘; into hidden
things he searched’; and what was crooked he made
straight‘.

2. He went forth fearlessly upon the face of the
mighty deep; he "surveyed the nations of the earth;
he measured the distances of the stars, and called them
by their names; he gloried in the extent of his know-
ledge, in the vigor of his understanding, and strove to
search even into what the Almighty had concealed.
And when I looked on him, I said, “What a piece of
work is man‘! how noble in reason‘! how inﬁnite in
+faculties‘! in form and moving how express and admi-
rable‘! in action how like an angel! in apprehension
how, like a God !”

3. I returned; his look was no more lofty, nor his
step proud; his broken frame Was like some ruined
tower; his hairs were white and scattered; and his eye
gazed vacantly upon what was passing around him.
The ‘tvigor of his intellect was wasted, and of all that
he had gained by study, nothing remained. He feared

when there was no danger, and when there was no sor- v

row he wept. His memory was decayed and treacher-
ous, and showed.him only broken images of the glory
thatwas departed. H
4. His house to him was like a strange land, and his
friends were counted as his enemies; and he thought
himself strong and healthful, while his foot tottered on
the *verge of the grave. ,‘He said of his son, “He is my
brother‘;” of his daughter’, ‘,‘I know her not‘;” and
he inquired what was his own name. And one who
supported his last steps, and ministered to his many
wants, said‘ to me, as I looked on the melancholy scene,
“Let thine heart receive instruction, for thou hast seen
an end of all earthly perfection.”

and on her cheek trembled something like the ﬁrst blush
of the morning; her lips moved, and there was har-
mony; and when she "‘ﬂoated in the dance, her light
form, like the aspen, seemed to move with. every breeze.
I returned, but she was not in the dance; I sought
her in the gay circle of her companions, but found her

voice was silent; she rejoiced on earth no more. I saw
a train, sable and slow—paced, who bore sadly to an open
grave what once was animated and beautiful. They
paused as they approached, and a voice broke the awful
silence: “Mingle ashes with ashes, and dust with its
original dust. To the earth whence it was taken, +con-
sign we the body of our sister.” They covered her with
the damp soil and the clods of the valley; and the
worms crowded into her silent abode. Yet one sad
mourner +lingered to cast himself upon the grave; and
as he wept, he said, “There is no beauty, nor grace, nor
loveliness, that continueth in man ; for this is the end of
all his glory and perfection.” I

7. I have seen an infant with a fair brow, and a
frame like polished ‘rivory. Its limbs were pliant in its
sports; it rejoiced, and again it wept; but whether its
glowing cheek dimpled with smiles, or its blue eye was
brilliant with tears, still I said to my heart, “ It is beau-
tiful.” It was like the ﬁrst pure blossom, which some
cherished plant had shot forth, whose cup is ﬁlled with
a dewdrop, and whose head reclines upon its parent
stem. ,

8. I again saw this child, when the lamp of reason
ﬁrst dawned in its mind. Its soul was gentle and peace~

ful; its eye sparkled with joy, as it looked round on this

good and pleasant world. It ran swiftly in the ways of
knowledge; it bowed its ear to instruction; it stood
like a lamb before its teachers. It was not proud, nor
envious, nor “‘“stubborn; and _it had never heard of the
vices and +vanities of the world. And when I looked

whom the world called honorable, and many Waited for
his smile. They pointed out the ﬁelds that were his,
and talked of the silver and gold that he had gathered;
they admired the stateliness of his domes, and _+eXtolled
the honor of his family. And his heart answered secret-

turned no thanks to God, neither did he fear nor serve
him.

cries of the poor, whose covering he had taken away;

“ ’T is the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy.

1. ABOUT twenty years ago, there lived a ‘singular
gentleman in the old Hall among the Elm Trees. He
was about three score years of age, Very rich, and some-

’what odd -in many of his habits, but forigenerosity and

+benevo1ence he had no equal.
2. No poor "‘cottager stood in need of comforts which
he was not ready to supply; no sick man or woman

‘ languished for want of his +assistance ; and not even‘ a

beggar, unless a known impostor, went empty handed
from the Hall.

The sick he +soothed, the hungry fed,
Bade care and sorrow ﬂy, ,

And loved to raise the downcast head
Of friendless poverty.

3. Now it happened that the old gentleman wanted T

a.-boy to wait upon him at table, and to attend 
5th R.——6 '

66 NEW FIFTH READER.

‘different ways, for he was very fond of young people.

But much as he liked the ‘society of the young, he had
a great aversion to that +curiosity in which many young
people are apt to indulge. He used to say, “The boy
Who will peep into a drawer, will be tempted to take
something out of it; and he who will steal a penny in
his youth will steal a pound in his manhood.”

‘4. N o sooner was‘ it known that the old gentleman
was in want of a boy, than twenty +appl»' 

 

J ons were
madefor the situation; but he determined not to engage
any -one, until he had in some way iasoertained that he
did not possess a curious, prying +disposition.

5. On Monday morning, seven lads, dressed in their
Sunday clothes, with bright and‘ happy faces, made
their appearance at the Hall, each of them desiring
to obtain the situation. Now the old gentleman, being
of a singular disposition, had prepared a room in such. a
way, that he might easily know if any of the young
people who applied, were given to meddle *unnecessarily
with things around them, or to peep into cupboards and
drawers. He took care that the lads who were then at
Elm Tree Hall, should be shown into this room one after
another. ‘

6. And ﬁrst, Charles Brown was sent into the room,
and told that he would have to wait a little. So Charles
sat down on a chair near the door. For some time he
was very quiet and looked about him ; but there seemed
to be so many curious things in the room, that at last,
he got up to peep at them.

7. On the table was‘ placed a dish cover, and Charles
wanted sadly to know what was under it, but he felt
afraid of lifting it up. Bad habits are strong things ;
and as Charles was of a curious disposition, he could not
withstand the ‘’‘temptation of taking one peep. So he
lifted up the cover. ,

8. This turned out to be a sad ‘faffair; for under the
dish cover was a heap of very light feathers; part of the
feathers, drawn up by a ‘‘“current of air, ﬂew about the
room, and Charles, in his fright, putting down the cover
hastily, puffed tlierest of them off the table.

ECLECTIC SERIES. 67

9. VVhat was to be done? Charles beganito pick up
the feathers one by one; but the old. gentleman, who
was in an ““adjoining room, hearing a “‘"scuffle, and guess-
ing the cause of it, entered the room, to the consterna-
tion of Charles Brown, who was very soon dismissed, as
a boy who had not “iprinciple enough to resist even a
slight temptation.

10. When the room was once more arranged, Henry
VVilkins was placed there, until such time as he should
be sent for. No sooner was he left to himself, than his
attention was attracted by a plate of ﬁne, ripe cherries.
Now Henry was uncommonly fond of cherries, and
he thought it would be impossible to miss one cherry
amongso many. He looked and longed, and longed
and looked, for some time, and just as he had got off

his seat to take one, he heard, as he thought, a foot

coming to the door; but no, it was a false alarm.

11. Taking fresh courage, he went +cautiously and
took a very ﬁne cherry, for he was determined to take
but one, and put it into his mouth. It was excellent;
and then he persuaded himself that he ran no risk in
taking another; this he did, and hastily popped it into
his mouth.

~ '12.‘ Now, the old gentleman had placed a few artiﬁcial

cherries at the top of the others, ﬁlled with ‘cayenne
pepper; one of these Henry had unfortunately taken,
and it made his mouth smart and burn most inmlerably.
The old gentleman heardlhim coughing, and knew very
well what was the matter. The boy that would take
what did not belong to him, if no more than a cherry,
was not the boy for him. Henry Wilkins was sent
about his business without delay, with his mouth almost
as hot, as if he had put a burningcoal into it.

13-. Rufus Wilson was next introduced into the room,
and left to himself; but he had not been there ten min-
utes,_ before he began to move from one place to another.
He was of a bold resolute temper, but not overburdened
with principle, for if he could have opened, every cup’-
board, closet, and drawer in the house, without being,
found out, he would have done it directly.

68 New FIFTH READER.

14. Havfng looked around the room, he noticed a
drawer to the table, and made up his mind to peep there-
in. But no sooner did he lay hold of the drawer knob,
than he set a large bell ringing, which was concealed
under the table. The old gentleman immediately an-
swered the summons,..and entered the room.

15. Rufus was so startled by the sudden ringing of the
bell, that all his impudence could not support him. He
looked as though any one might knock him down with a
feather. The old gentleman asked him if he had rung
the bell because he wanted any thing. Rufus was much
confused, and stammered, and tried to excuse himself,
but all to no purpose, for it did not prevent him from
being ordered off the premises.

16. George Jones was then shown into the room by an
old steward; and being of a cautious disposition, he
touched nothing,‘ but only looked at the things about
him. At last he saw that a closet door was a little open,
and thinking it would be impossible for any one to know

I that he had opened it a little more, he Very cautiously

opened it an inch farther, looking down at the bottom of
the door, that it might not catch against any thing, and
make a noise. 1 ,

17. Now had he looked at the ‘top instead of the bot-
tom, it might have been better for him, forto the top of

the doogwas fastened a plug which ﬁlled up the hole of *

a small barrel of shot. He ventured to open the door
another inch, and then another, till the plug being pulled
out of the barrel, the leaden shot began to pour out at a
strange rate; at the bottom of the closet was placed a tin
pan”, and the shot falling upon this pan made such a
clatter, that George was frightened half out of his senses.

18. The old gentleman soon came into the room to in-
quire what was the matter, and there he found George
nearly as pale as a sheet. George was soon dismissed.

19. It now came the turn of Albert Jenkins to be put
into the room. The other boys had been sent to their
homes by fferent ways, and no one knew what the ex-
perience of the other had been in the room of trial.

EOLECTIG snmns. 69

20. On the table stood a small round box, with a screw
top to it, and Albert thinking it contained something
curious, could not be easy without unscrewing the top,
but no ‘sooner did he do this, than out bounced an arti-
ﬁcial snake, full a yard long, and fell upon his arm. b He
started back, and ‘uttered a scream, which brought the
old gentleman to _his elbow. There stood Albert, with
the bottom of the box in one hand, the top in the other,
and the snake on the ﬂoor. .

21. “Come, come, said the old gentleman, one snake is
quite enough to have in the house at a time; therefore,
the sooner you are gone the better.” With that he dis—
missed him, without waiting a moment for his reply.

22. VVilliam Smith next entered the room, and being
left alone, soon began to amuse himself in looking at the
curiosities around him. William was not only curious
and prying, but dishonest too, and observing that the
key was left in the drawer of a book case, he stepped on
tiptoe in that direction. The key had a wire fastened to
it, which communicated with an electrical machine, and
William received such a shock as he was not likely to
forget. No sooner did he sufficiently recover himself to
walk, than he was told to leave the house, and let pther
people look and unlock their own drawers.

23. The other boy was Harry Gordon, and though he
was left in the room full twenty minutes, he neverduring
that time, stirred from his chair. Harry had eyes in his
head as well as the others, but he had more integrity in
his heart; neither the dish cover, the cherries, the
drawer knob, the closet door, the round box, nor the

key, tempted him to rise from his seat; and the conse-i

quence was, that, in half an hour after, he was engaged
in the service of the old gentleman at Elm Tree Hall.

24. Harry Gordon followed his good old master to his
grave‘, and received a large legacy for his upright con-
duct in his service‘. Read this, ye busy, meddliiig,
peeping, pilfering youngpeople’, and imitate the ex-
ample of Harry Gordon‘.

1. A YOUNG chicken-cock, that Was sitting upon the
branch" of a tree, crowed so loud, that a fox which
chanced to be passing by, heard him. So he Went up to
him and said, “How do you do, my dear friend? I have
not seen you for an age.” p ‘

2. “Thank you for your politeness, sir,” said the cock.
“I am as Wellas usual.” “I am delighted to hear it,”
said the fox. “Pray come down from that high perch,
so that I may see you closer, and admire your beautiful
feathers.” r i

3. “No,,I am much obliged to you,” said the cock,
“that will not do, for I have heard my old father say,
that a fox is very fond of the ﬂesh of a cock, and .Will

I Will stay where I am.” . I

me leave to tell you that your sire is an old fool, and
does not speak a Word of truth, for I know that all the
beasts and birds are now at ‘*peace; therefore you need
not mind that, but ﬂy down and see me.”

to hear it, I am sure.” And saying this, he +stretched.;

7. “Dear me,” said the fox; “coming this way?
Then it is high time to be gone.” “Gone!” said the
cock ; “why should you go ?I What danger can there be
to a fox in meeting hounds in time of peace?”

8. “Yes,” cried the fox, “all you say is true; but it is

ten to one that these vile curs have not yet heard of the
peace; therefore I must run as fast as I can to get out of

DIRECTIONS FOR READING.

I. PRELIMINARY REMARKS.

THE great object to be accomplished in reading as

rhetorica.l exercise is, to convey to the hearer, fully and
clearly, the ideas_ and feelings of the Writer.

In order to do this, it is necessary that the feeiings of the
author whose language is read, should be infused into 
breast of the reader, and then alone can they be properly 

. fully expressed. .

‘In accordance with this view, a preliminary rule of ‘im-
portance is the following.

RULE I.——Before attempting to’ read a lesson, the
learner should make himself fully acquainted with the
subject as treated of in that lesson, and endeavor to make
his own, the feelings and sentiments of the writer.

  

° REMARK.—To accomplish the purpose indicated in th  
every lesson should be well studied ‘beforehand, and no soil 
should be permitted to attempt to read any thing, whiclf‘,”li”%ié7
can not easily understand. When he has thus identiﬁed him-
self with the author, he has the substance of all rules in his
own breast. It is by going to nature that we ﬁnd rules. The
child or /the savage orator, never mistakes inieinflection, or
emphasis, or modulation. The best speakers and readers are
those who follow the impulse of nature as felt in their own
hearts, or most closely imitate it as observed in others.

QUESTIONS.-—~What is the chief design of reading? In order to do
this, what is first necessary? Repeat the rule‘. For the purpose of
being able ‘to observe this, what must be done?. From whence are all
rules derived?

children at her side, endeavoring by listening to the
+artlessness of their prattle, to dissipate the heavy gloom

- that pressed upon her mind. For a year, her own feeble

hand had provided for her helpless family, for she had
no supporter: she thought of no friend in all the wide,
+unfriendly world around.

2. But that +mysterious Providence, the wisdom of
whose ways is above human comprehension, had visited
her with wasting sickness, and her little means had
become texhausted. It was now,‘ too, midwinter, and
the snow lay heavy and deep through all the surround-
ing forests, while storms still seemed gathering in the
heavens, and the driving wind roared amid the neigh-
boring pines, and rocked her puny mansion.

3. The last herring smoked upon the coals before
her; it was the only article of food she possessed, and
no wonder her forlorn, “desolate state brought up in
her lone bosom all the +anxieties of a mother, when
she looked upon her children: and no wonder, forlorn
as she was, if she suffered the heart swellings of despair
to rise, even though she knew that He, whose promise
is to the widow and to the orphan, can not forget his
Word.

4. ‘Providence had, many years before, taken from
her her eldest son, who went from his forest home to
try his fortune on the high seas, since which she had
heard no tidings of him; and, in her latter time, had, by
the hand of death, deprived her of the companion and
staff of her earthly pilgrimage, in the person of her

. husband. Yet to this hour she had upborne; she had
‘not only been able to provide for her little ﬂock, but

had never lost an +opportunity of Tministering to the
wants of the miserable and destitute. 
5. The ‘rindolent may well bear with poverty, w‘h:ile

the ability to gain sustenance remains’. The  

who has but his own wants to supply, may suffer with
fortitude the winter of want; his affections are not

6. But the “tindustrious mother of helpless and de-
pending children, far from the reach of human charity,
has none of these to ”‘“console her. And such a one was

’ the widow of the Pine Cottage ; but as she bent over the _

ﬁre, and took up the last scanty “*remnant of food,

to spread before her children, her spirits seemed to
brighten up, as by some sudden and mysterious impulse,
and Cowper’s beautiful lines came uncalled across her
mind: _
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust him for his grace;
Behind a frowning Providence
He hides a smiling face.

7. The smoked herring was scarcely laid upon the
table, when a gentle rap at the door, and loud barking
of a dog, attracted the attention of the family. The

. children ﬂew to open it, and a weary traveler, in tattered

garments, and ‘’apparently indifferent health, entered
and begged a lodging, and a mouthful of food. Said he,
“It is now twenty-four hours since I tasted bread.”
The widow’s heart bled anew as under a fresh complica-
tion of distresses; for her sympathies “tlingered not
around her ﬁreside. She hesitated not even» now; rest
and a share of all she had she proffered to the stranger.
“We shall not be forsaken,” said she, “or suffer deeper
for an act of charity.”

8. The traveler drew near the board, but when he

, saw the scanty fare, he raised his eyes toward heaven

with astonishment: “And is this all your store?” said
he, “and a share of this do you offer to one you know
not? then never saw I charity before! but madam,” said
he, ‘continuing, “do you not wrong your children by
giving a part of your last mouthful to a stranger?”

9. “Ah,” said the poor widow, and the teardrops
gushed into her eyes as she said it, “I have a boy, a
darling son, somewhere on the face of the wide world,
unless heaven has taken him away, and I only act
toward you, as I would that others should ‘act toward
him. God, who sent manna from heaven, can provide

for us as he did for Israel; and how should I this night
offend him, if my son should be a +wanderer, +dest_itute
as you, and he should have provided for him a home,
even poor as this, were I to turn you unrelieved away.”

10. The widow ended, and the stranger springing
from his seat, clasped her in his arms: “God indeed has
provided your son a home, and has given him wealth to
reward the goodness of his ‘tbenefactressz my mother!
oh my mother!” It was her long lost son, returned to
her bosom from the Indies. He had chosen that +dis-
guise that hemight the more completely surprise his
family; and never was surprise more perfect, or followed
by a sweeter cup of joy. ' .

11. That humble +residence in the forest was ex-
changed for one comfortable, and indeed beautiful, in
the valley; and the widow lived long with her dutiful
son, in the enjoyment of worldly plenty, and in the

a delightful employments of virtue: and, at this day, the

passer-by is pointed to the willow that spreads its
branches above her grave. ‘

2. O Lord,our Lord, how +eXcellent is thy name in
all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
VVhen I consider thy heavens, the work of thy ﬁngers;

the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained; what

man that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a
little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him With
gloryand honor. Thou madest him to have dominion
over the work of thy hands; thou hast put all things
under his feet. 0 Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy
name in all the earth!

3. “I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my
fortress, my God; in him will I trust.”——“Because he
hath set his love upon me, therefore will I +deliver him:
I will set him on high, because he hath known my
name. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;
I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and

him my +sa1vation.”

4. 0 come, let us sing unto the Lord, let us heartily
rejoice in the strength of our salvation. Let us come
before his presence with thanksgiving, and show our-
selves glad in him with psalms. For the Lord is a
great God, and a great King above all gods. 0 worship
the Lord in the beauty of holiness; let the whole earth
stand in awe of him. For he cometh; for he cometh, to
judge the earth; and with righteousness to judge the

. world, and the people with his truth.

5. O that men would praise the Lord for his good-
ness, and for his wonderful works to the children of
men! They that go down to the sea in ships, that do
business in great waters; these see the works of the
Lord, and his wonders in the deep. For he command-

down again to the depths; their soul is melted because
of trouble; they reelto and fro, and +stagger like a
drunken man, and are at their Wit’s end. Then they
cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth
them out of their +distresses. He maketh the storm a
calm, so that the Waves thereof are still. Then are they
glad because they are quiet; so he bringeth them unto
their desired haven. O that men would praise the Lord

for his goodness, and for his Wonderful Works to the I

children of men!

6. The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not Want. He
maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth
me beside the still Waters. He restoreth my soul; he
leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s
sake. Yea, though I Walk through the valley of the
‘fshadow of death, I Will fear no evil: for thou art with
me; thy rod and thy staff, they +comfort me. Thou
preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
enemies; thou anointest my head With oil; my cup run-
neth over. Surely goodness and mercy Will follow me
all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

QUESTIONS.-—What does God promise to one who makes Him his
refuge? What is meant by “setting him on high?” Is the promise
of “satisfying him with long life,” fulﬁlled in this World? Who are
described in the 5th paragraph?

Which are the nouns in the last sentence? The verbs? The pro-
nouns? The adjectives? What is “the”? See Pinneo’s Primary
Grammar, page 19.

2. It is impossible, even at this distant period, to re-

in Lower Wolga by the name of the “fa7m'ne year.” I
remember the summer, whose scorching heats had dried
up all the ﬁelds, and the drought had no relief but from
the tears of the ruined farmer.

3. I remember the cold, comfortless autumn, and the
despairing +rustics, crowding round their empty farms
with folded arms, and sorrowful countenances, +ponder-

golden harvest. I remember the winter which suc-

laboring peasant: a man remarkable for his assiduity,
and the skill and judgment with which he cultivated his

means being larger than his wants, his granaries, even
at this time, were full of corn. The dry year coming
on, had beggared all the village, except himself. Here
was an opportunity to grow rich. Mark how Flor Silin
acted. Having called the poorest of his _ neighbors

appropriate utterance.

For the purpose of‘ avoiding the more common errors under
this head, observe the following Rules.

ampled generosity; for sordid propensities exist in the
village, as well as in the +p'opulous city.

7. The fame of Flor Silin’s benevolence having
reached other villages, the famished inhabitants pre-
sented themselves before him, and begged for corn. This
good creature received them as brothers; and, while his
store remained, afforded all relief. At length, his wife,
seeing no end to the ““generosity of his noble spirit,
remindedhim how necessary it would be to think of

their ownwants, and hold his lavish hand, before it was I

too late. “It is written in the Scripture,” said he,
“ Give, and it shall be given unto you.”

8.'The following year, Providence listened to the I

prayers of the poor, and the harvest was abundant.
The peasants who had been saved from starving by Flor
Silin, now gathered around him. .

9. “Behold,” said they, “the corn you lent us. You
saved our wives and children. We should have been
+famished but for you; may Godreward you; he only
can; all we have to give, is our corn and grateful

*thanks.” “I want no corn at ‘present, my good neigh-

bors,” said he; “my harvest has exceeded all my expect-
ations ; for the rest, thank Heaven: I have been but an
humble ’Vinstrument.”

10. They urged him in vain. “No,” said he, “I
shall not accept your corn. If you have superﬂuities,
share them among your poor neighbors, who, being
unable to sow their ﬁelds last autumn, are still in want;
let us assist them, my dear friends; the Almighty will
bless us for it.” “Yes,” replied the grateful +peasants,
“our poor neighbors shall have this corn. They shall
know it is to you that they owe this timely succor, and
join to teach their children the debt of gratitude, due to
your +benevolent heart.” Silin raised his tearful eyes
to heaven. An angel might have envied him his
feelings. ' . I

“ In one rash hour,
Perform a deed that haunts him to the grave!”

 

4. Could I call around me, in one vast assembly, the
young men of this nation, I would say: Hopes of my
country, blessed be ye of the Lord, now in the dew of
your youth. But look well to your footsteps; for +vi-

pers, and scorpions, and adders surround your way.-
Look at the generation who have just +preceded youg

The morning of their life Was cloudless, and it dawned
as brightly as your own. But behold, now, the smit-
ten, enfeebled, inﬂamed, debauched, idle, poor, irreli-
gious, and +vicious, with halting step, dragging onward
to meet an early grave. i

5. Their bright prospects are clouded, and their sun
is set, never to rise. No house of their own receives
them, while from poorer to poorer tenements they de-
scend, as timprovidence dries up their resources. And,
now, who are those that wait on their footsteps, with
muﬁled faces and +sable garments? That is a father,
and that is a mother, whose gray hairs are coming with
sorrow to the grave. That is a sister, weeping over
evils which she can not arrest; and there is the broken-
hearted wife; and these are the children—helpless in—
nocents!-———for whom their father has provided no
inheritance, save one of dishonor, and nakedness, and
woe!

6. And is this, beloved youth, the history of your
course? In this scene of desolation, do you see the
image of your future selves? Is this the poverty, and
the disease, which, as an armed man, shall take hold
on you? alnid are your relatives and friends to succeed
those who now move on, i.n this mournful +procession,
weeping as they go?

,7. Yes, bright as your morning now opens, and high’

ascyour hopes beat, this is your noon and your night,
unless you shun those habits of intemperance which
have thus early made theirs a day of clouds and of
thick darkness. If you frequent places of evening re-
sort for 4"social drinking; if you set out with drinking,

«daily, a little, prudently, +temperately; it is yourselves,

which, as in a glass, you behold.

8. “One of the greatest consolations afforded to my
mind by the success of the-temperance cause, is the re-
ﬂection that my child will not be a drunkard.” Such
was the language of a distinguished philanthropist, as
he held a listening assembly chained bythe voice of his
'!'eloquence.

9. To this remark the heart of every parent +assents;
for that the progress of the temperance cause will be so
great, at the period when the child, which is now an
infant, shall come upon the theater of life, as to render
all use of ardent spirit, as a drink, idisreputable, can
scarcely be questioned.

10. If any father or mother could lift the Vail of futu-
rity, and read on the page of coming years, that the son
now so loved, so idolized, perhaps, would become a

  bloated, polluted, and polluting creature, reeling under

the +inﬂuence of . ardent spirit, the remainder of life
would be wretched. To such a parent, this world would,
indeed, be a vale of tears; and the silence and +solitude
of the tomb, would be welcomed as the place where the
weary might be at rest.

11. The temperance +reform does in fact lift the Vail
of years, and disclose to the parents of the present gener-
ation, their children and children’s children freed from
all the woes and curses of drunkenness, the smile of
gratitude upon their countenance, and the language of
benediction upon their lips.

12. “My child Will not be a drunkard ! ” Cheering“;
thought! How it swells the heart with emotions too big
for utterance! What an +animating prospect does it open
to the mind! Alms-houses, and jails, and penitentiaries
and State-prisons will then stand only as so many mon-
uments of the vices of an age gone by; and the evils
consequent upon the use of ardent spirits shall exist only
uponthe historian’s page, as so many +records of for-
mer degeneracy and the errors of mankind.

MAN AND THE INFERIOR ANIMALS.

REMARK.—Reco1lect, always, that you have it in your power to
become a good reader, by attention, study, and practice.

ARTICULATE distinctly. Do not say ’rence, for dif—f'er-ence;
in-5-zflruc, for in-struct; pro-vi-d’n, for pro-vid-ing; i-r-reg’lar, for
ir-reg-u-lar; fac’Z-ty, for fac-ul-ty. '

1. THE chief idifference between man and the other
animals consists in this, that the former has reason,
Whereas the latter have only instinct; but, in order to
understand What We mean by the terms reason and in-
stinct, it Will be +necessary to mention three things, in
Which the difference very +distinctly appears.

2. Let us, first, to bring the parties as nearly on a

level as possible, consider man in a savage state, Wholly

, ECLECTIC SERIES. A 89

+occupied, like the beasts of the ﬁeld, in providing for
the wants of his animal nature; and here, the ﬁrst dis-
tinction that appears between them is, the use of imple-
ments. When the savage +provides himself with a hut,
or a wigwam, for shelter, or that he may store up his
provisions, he does no more than is done by the rabbit,
the beaver, the bee, and birds of every species.

3. But the man can not make any +progress in this
work without tools; he must provide himself with an
ax, even before he can cut down a tree for its timber;
whereas these animals form their burrows, their cells,
or their nests, with no other tools than those with which
nature has provided them. In icultivating the ground,
also, man can do nothing without a spade or a plow;
nor can he reap what he has sown, till he has shaped
an +implement with which to cut down his harvest.
But the inferior animals provide for themselves and
their young without any of these things.

4. Now for the second distinction. Man, in all his
*operations, makes mistakes; animals make none. Did
you ever hear of ‘such a thing as a bird sitting on a twig,
lamenting over her half—ﬁnished nest, and puzzling her
little head to know. how to complete it? Or did you ever
see the cells of a bee-hive in clumsy, irregular shapes,
or observe anything like a discussion in the little com-
munity, as if there was a difference of opinion among
the architects?

5. The lower animals are even better +physicians than
we are; for when they are ill, they will, many of them,

A seek out some particular herb which they do not use as

food, and which possesses a medicinal quality exactly
suited to the complaint; whereas, the whole college of
physicians will dispute for a ‘‘“century about the virtues
of a single drug.

6. Man undertakes nothing in which he is not more
or less puzzled; and must try numberless ‘iexperiments,
before he can bring his undertakings to any thing like
perfection; even the simplest operations of “‘“domestic

life are not well performed without some +ex.perience;
5th R.-«B - - l

90 NEW FIFTH READER.

and the term of man’s life is half wasted, before he has
done with his mistakes and begins to proﬁt by his lessons.

7. The third distinction is, that animals make no
+impr0vemem,‘s,- while the knowledge, and skill, and the
success of man are perpetually on the increase. ‘Ani-
mals, in all their operations, follow the ﬁrst impulse of
nature, or that instinct which God has implanted in
them. In all they do undertake, therefore, their works
are more perfect and regular than those of man. ,

8. But man, having been endowed With the ‘‘faculty
of thinking or reasoning about what he does, is enabled,
by patience and industry, to correct the mistakes into
which he at first falls, and to go on constantly improv-
ing. , A bird’s nest is, indeed, a perfect +structure; yet

the nest of a swallow of the nineteenth century, is not E

at all more “tcommodious or elegant, than those that
were built amid the rafters of N oah’s ark. But if we
compare the wigwam of the savage with the temples
and ‘tpalaces of ancient Greece and Rome, we then shall
see to what ,man’s mistakes, rectiﬁed and improved
upon, conduct him.

9. When the vast sun shall vail his golden light
Deep in the gloom of everlasting night;
When wild, destriqctive ﬂames shall wrap the skies,
When ruin triumphs, and when nature dies;
Man shallalone the wreck of worlds survive;
’Mid falling spheres, immortal man shall live.

QUEs'rIoNs.—What_ is the subject of this lesson? What three things
form the distinction between man and animals? What is instinct?
What is the difference between instinct and reason? Is man an
animal? Is man superior to all other animals»? In what does the
superiority consist? What does this enable man to do?

for prod-i-gal; 0c-ky—py-ing for oc-cu—py-ing; getk-err for gath-er;
as-tron-i-muz for as-tron-0-mews. —

SOUND the unaccented a properly in words like attention, pleasant,
importance, mental, capable, &c.

1. LET me call your attention to the ‘importance of
improving your time. The inﬁnite value of time is not
"realized. It is the most precious thing in all the World;
“the only thing of which it is a virtue to be covetous,
and yet the only thing of which all men are ‘-“prodigal.”

2. In the ﬁrst place, then, reading is a most interest-
ing ~——and' pleasant method of "occupying your leisure
hours. All young people have, or may have, time
enough to read. The difficulty-is, they are not careful
to improve it. _

3. Their hours of “'“leisure are either idled away, or
talked away, or spent in some other wayequally vain
and useless; and then they complain, that they have no
time forthe cultivation of their minds and hearts.

4. Time is sofprecious, that there is never but one
moment in the world at once, and that is always ‘taken
away, before another is given. ‘Only take care to gather
up the ‘fragments of time, and you will never want

the last syllable instead of the first. In correcting the sound
of the ﬁrst 0 in pro-pose’, he will perhaps pronounce it

upon the unaccented syllable should be carefully avoided.

REMARK 2.--In all cases of this kind, these sounds are
omitted, in the ﬁrst instance, merely because they are diﬂicult,
and require care and attention for their utterance, although,

after a While it becomes a habit. The only remedy is to de-'

Vote that care and attention which may be necessary. There
is no other difficulty, unless there should be a defect in the

leisure for the reading of useful books. And in what
way can you spend your unoccupied hours more pleas-
antly, than in holding ‘‘converse with the wise and the
good, through the “'medium of their writings? To a
mind not altogether devoid of ?“curiosity, books form an
inexhaustible source of enjoyment.

5. It is a, consideration of no small weight, that read-
ing furnishes material for interesting and useful conver-

sation, Those who are ignorant of books, must of course .

have their thoughts conﬁned to very narrow limits.
What occurs in th cir immediate neighborhood, the state
of the market, the idle report, the tale of scandal, the

foolish story, these make up the circle of their knowl- V

edge, and furnish the topics of their conversation. They

have nothing to say of importance, because they know ,

nothing of importance.

6. A taste for useful reading is an ‘reffectual preserv-
ative from vice. Next to the fear of God, implanted in
the heart, nothing is a better safeguard to character,
than the love of good books. They are.the handmaids
of virtue and religion. They quicken our sense of duty,
unfold our responsibilities, strengthen our +principles,
conﬁrm our habits, inspire in us the love of what is
right and useful, and teach us to look with disgust upon
what is low, and groveling, and +vicious.

7. The high value of ‘“mental cultivation, is another
weighty motive for giving attendance to reading. VVhat
is it that mainly distinguishes a man from a brute?
Knowledge. What makes the vast difference there is,
between savage and civilized nations? Knowledge.
VVhat forms the ‘“principal difference between men, as
they appear in the same society? Knowledge.

8. What raised Franklin from the humble station of r

a printer’s boy, to the ﬁrst honors of his country?
Knowledge. What took Sherman from his shoemaker’s
bench, gave him a seat in Congress, and there made his
voice to be heard among the wisest and best of his com-
peers? Knowledge. WVhat raised Simpson from the
weaver’s +loom, to a place-among the ﬁrst of mathemati-

ECLECTIC SERIES. 93

cians ; and Herschel, from being a poor ﬁfer’s boy in the
army, to a station among the ﬁrst of astronomers?
Knowledge.

9. Knowledge is power. It is the philosopher’s stone,
the true secret, that turns every thing it touches into
gold. It is the scepter, that gives us our +dominion over
nature; the key, that unlocks the storehouse of creation,
and opens to us the treasures of the +universe.

10. The circumstances in which you are placed, as the

members of a free and ‘Fintelligent "community, demand

of you a careful improvement of the means of knowledge
you enjoy. You live in an age of great mental excite-
ment. The public mind is awake, and society in general
is fast rising in the scale of improvement. At the same
time, the means of knowledge are most ‘*abundant.

11. The road to wealth, to honor, to ‘Fusefulness, and
happiness is open to all, and all who will, may enter
upon it with the almost certain +prospect of success. In
this free community, there are no iprivileged orders.
Every man ﬁnds his level. If he has talents, he will be
known and estimated, and rise in the respect and “loon-
ﬁdence of society.

12. Added to this, every man is here a freeman. He
has 3. voice in the election of rulers, in making and exe-
cuting the laws, and may be called to ﬁll important
places of honor and trust, in the community of which
he is a member. What then is the duty of persons in
these ‘circumstances? Are they not called to cultivate

their minds, to improve their talents, and to acquire the

knowledge which is necessary to ‘enable them to act
with honor and usefulness, the part +assigned them on
the stage of life?

13. A diligent use of the means of knowledge, accords
well with your nature as rational and immortal beings.
God has given you minds which are capable of +indeﬁ-
nite improvement; he has placed you in circumstances

"peculiarly favorable for making such improvement,

and, to inspire you with diligence in mounting up the
shining course before you, he points you to the prospect
of an endless +existence beyond the grave.

94   NEW FIFTH READER.

14. If you, who possess these powers, were destined,
after spending a few days on earth, to fall into non-
existence; if there were nothing in you which death
can not destroy, nor the grave cover, there would indeed
be but little inducement to cultivate your minds. “For

‘who would take pains to trim a taper which shines but

for a moment, and can never be lighted again?”
15. But if you have minds which are capable of end-
less progression in knowledge, of endless approximation

to the supreme intelligence; if, in the midst of +unre-  

mitting success, objects of new interest will be forever
opening before you; oh, what prospects are presented
to the view of man! what strong inducements to +culti-
vate his mind and heart, and to enter upon that course

of improvement here, which is to run on, brightening .

in glory and in bliss, ages without end!

QUESTIONS.-—VVl1a.t is the subject of this lesson? What is a plea-
sant method of occupying our leisure hours ? For what does reading
furnish materials? From what does it preserve us ? If a man has
knowledge, what may he hope for? What peculiar reasons are there
Why American children should cultivate their minds?

In the last sentence, what interjection is there? What is an inter-
jection? What does the word mean ? Will you name four interjec-
tions? ‘Why are they so called? See Pinneo’s Analytical Gram-
mar, page 20, Art. 55. ‘

IN GRAMMATICAL QUESTIONS reference will hereafter be made to
Pinneo’s Analytical Grammar. Such questions will be found very
proﬁtable and interesting to the pupil. They will be to some de-
gree of an analytical character, as this not only increases the interest

- of the study, but gives a more comprehensive and philosophical view

of the structure of sentences.

wrapped -in their large mantles of various hues might be
seen winding their way among the groves fringing the
bay on the east, or descending from the hills and ravine
on the north, toward the chapel; and by degrees their
numbers increased, till, in a short time, every path along
the beach, and over the uplands, presented an almost
+uninterrupted procession of both sexes and of every
age, all pressing to the house of God.

2. So few "canoes were round the ship yesterday, and
the landing place had been so little +thronged, as our
boats passed to and fro, that one might have thought

- the ‘district but thinly inhabited; but now, such multi-

tudes were seen gathering from various ‘“directions, that
the exclamation, “ VV/mt crowds of people! What crowds
of people l.’’ was heard from the quarter-deck to the fore-
castle. ~ - l -

3. Even to myself it was a sight of surprise; surprise
not at the magnitude of the population, but that the ob-
ject for which they were evidently +assembling, should-
bring together so great a multitude. And as my thoughts
+re-echoed the words, i“VVhat crowds of people!” +re-
membrances and !affections of deep power came over
me; and the silent ‘'musings of my own heart were,
“What a change! “That a happy change!”

4. When at this very place, only four years ago, the
known Wishes and example of chiefs of high authority,

the daily “tpersuasion of teachers, added to motives of .

“Fcuriosity and novelty, could scarcely induce a hundred
of the +inhabitants, to give an +irregular, careless, and

' +impatient ‘attendance on the services of the sanctuary.
, But now,

“Like mountain ‘torrents pouring to the main,
From every glen a living stream came forth;
From every hill, in crowds, they hastened down,
To Worship Him, who deigns, in humblest fane,
On Wildest_ shore, to meet th’ upright in heart.”

5. The scene, as looked on from our ship in the still-

ness of a brightly-beaming Sabbath morning, was Well

T *calculated, with its ‘associations, to prepare the mind

for strong ﬁmpressions on a nearer view, whoirthe ”'con-
clusion of our own public worship should allow us to go
on shore. Mr. Goodrich had tapprised us, that he had

  found it expedient to hold both the services of the Sab-

bath in the forepart of the day, that all might have the
beneﬁt of two sermons, and still reach their abodes be-
fore ‘Fnightfall. For, ‘
“Numbers dwelt +remote,
And ﬁrst must +traverse many a weary mile,
To reach the altar of the God they love.’’

6. And it was arranged, that, on this occasion, the se-
cond service should be ‘‘‘postponed till the ofﬁcers should
be at liberty to leave the ship. , It was near twelve o’clock
when we went on shore; the captain and ﬁrst lieutenant,
the purser, surgeon, several of the frmidshipnien, and
myself.   Though the services had commenced when we
landed, large numbers were seen circling the doors with-
out; but, as we afterward found, only from the +imprac-
ticability of obtaining places within.

7. The house is an immense +stféuct111*e, capable of con-
taining many thousands, every part of which was ﬁlled,
except a small area in front of the pulpit, where seats
were reserved for us, and to which we made our way, in

a slow and tedious'+procession, from the difﬁculty of ﬁnd-

ing a spot to place even our footsteps, without treading
on limbs of the people, seated on their feet, as closely,
almost, as they could be stowed. '

8. As we entered, Mr. Goodrich paused in his sermon,
till we should be seated. I ‘ascended the pulpit beside
him, from which I had a full view of the +congrcgation.
The suspense of attention in the people was only +mo-
mentary, notwithstanding the entire novelty to them of
the laced coats, and other appendages of naval uniform.
I can scarce describe the emotions experienced in glanc-
ing an eye over the immense number, seated so thickly
on the matted floor as to seem, +literal1y, one mass of
heads, covering an area of more than nine thousand

, square feet.‘ The sight was most striking, and soon be-

came, not only to myself, but to some of my fellow-ofﬁ-V
cers, deeply affecting. I

9. I have listened, with delightful attention, to some
of the highest ‘Feloquence, the pulpits of America and
England, of the present day, can boast. I have seen
tears of ‘conviction and +penitence ﬂow freely, under
the sterner truths of the word of God; but it was left for
one at Hilo, the mostlobscure corner of these distant
islands, to excite the liveliest emotions ever experienced,
and leave the deepest impressions of the extent and
*unsearchable riches of the gospel, which I have ever
known. I

10. It seemed, even while I gazed, that the majesty of
that Power might be seen rising and +erecting to itself
athrone, permanent as glorious, in the hearts of these
but late utterly benighted and deeply polluted people.
And when I compared them, as they had once been
known to mh, and as they now appeared, the change
seemed the effect of a lmandate scarcely less mighty in
its power, or speedy in its result, than that exhibited,
when it was said, “Let there be light, and there was light!”

11. The depth of the impression arose from the +irre-
sistible +conviction that the SPIRIT OF GOD was there.
It could have been nothing else. Witli the exception of
the inferior chiefs, having charge of ,the district, and
their dependents, of two or three native members of the
church, and of the mission family, scarcely one of the
whole multitude was in other than the native dress, the
simple garments of their +primitive state.

12. In this respect and in the ‘'attitude of sitting, the
assembly was purely pagan. But the breathless silence,
the eager attention, the half-suppressed sigh, the tear,
the various feeling, sad, peaceful, joyous, ‘discoverable
in the faces of many; all spoke the presence of an invisi-
ble but +omnipotent Power, the Power which alone can
melt and renew the heart of man, even as it alone ﬁrst

' brought it into existence.

13. It was, in a word, a heathen congregation laying
hold onthe hopes of eternity; a heathen congregation,

licentious, and Wild pagan

1. A GENTLEMAN who had traveled in Europe, relates
that he one day visited the hospital of Berlin, where he
saw a man Whose exterior was very striking. His ﬁgure,

tall and +commanding, was bending with age, but more I

with sorrow; the few scattered hairs which remained on
his temples were white, almost as the driven snow, and
the deepest +melancho1y was depicted in his countenance.

2. On inquiring who he Was, and what brought him
there, he started, as if from sleep, and after looking
aroundhim, began with slow and measured stepsto
stride the hall, repeating in a low but ‘taudible voice,

A “Once one is two; once oneis two.”
3. Now and then he Would stop and remain with his _

arms folded on his breast as if in lcontemplation, for
some minutes; then again resuming‘ his walk, he con-
tinued to repeat, “Once one is two‘; once one is two‘.”
His story, as our traveler understood it, was as follows.
