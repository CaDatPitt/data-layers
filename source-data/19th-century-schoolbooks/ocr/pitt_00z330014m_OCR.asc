CONJUGATION.
Remarks.-1. Some verbs of this form are sometimes used in a passive
sense; as, "The house i bilding;" "While these arrangements were
making."
2. In modern usage the same idea is often expressed by the imperfect
participle passive; as, "What lies at the bottomn of the question which is
now being discuzssed every where?"-Dr. Arnold. Leetures on History. " He
struck the Count de Harcourt a violent blow, as he was being led away."James. Life of Edward the Black Prince.
This mode of expressionl is not improper in the nature of things, but it is
too modern to be yet considered a principle of the language.
NEGATIVE FORM.
In simple neyation the adverb not is placed after
the verb, or after the first auxiliary--sometimes
after the object of a transitive       verb; as, "I love
not this man;" " I do not love you;"         " I love you
not."
Not is placed    before the     infinitive  and   participles; as, " Not to     love;" "Not loving;" and after
the subyect in the imperative mood, when the            subject is expressed.
The simple forms of the presenrt and past tenses are seldom
used in this negative form.

INTERROGATIVE        FORM.
In interrogative sentences the subject is placed
after the first auxiliary, or after the verb      when
there is no auxiliary; as, "Lovest thou?"'" Dost

IRREGULAR VERB S.
An irregular verb is one which does not form its
past tense and auxiliary perfect participle by adding ed.
There are about one hundred and seventy irregular verbs,
which mnay be divided into two classes-those in which the
past tense and auxiliary perfect participle are alike, and those
in which they are unlike.
Some verbs have two forms of the past tense, or Of the auxiliary perfect participle, or of bothl.   The preferable forms are
first in order.  If the first formns are alike, the verb is placed in
the first class; if they are diflerent, it is placed in the second.
Note.-The second class should be particularly attended to, for it is with
respect to verbs of this class that errors are most frequently commnitted. The
past tense and the auxiliary perfect participle are alike in most verbs, and
we are apt to use the one for the other whlen they differ. Thus, " I done,"
" I seen," are often usedcl for " I did," " I saw;" and " I have went," "I have
drank," for " I  have f1one,"  I have drunk."  So in the passive. "Toasts
were drank," is now often used for " Toasts were drank."*

* It wouild be better for, those who are afraid to say, "Toasts were drutnk," lest in
might be suipposed(I that the toasts welre intoxicated, to use somIe other form of expression, sutch as, "The conmpany drank toasts," and not make the innocent language
suffer to save the character of the toasts..998                    IRREGULAR VERBS.

English language. These principles relate,
1. To the written characters of the language;
2. To its pronunciation;
3. To the classification of its words;
4. To the construction of its sentences;
5. To its versification.
The first division is called ORTHOGRAPHY; the second, ORTrHOEPY; the third, ETYMOLOGY; the fourth, SYNTAX; and the
fifth, PROSODY.
Note.-These principles are derived from the usage of the best writers

ORTHOGRAPHY.
ORTHOGRAPHY treats of the letters and other

5. Impersonal Verbs.-Some verbs are used only in the third person singular,
having the pronoun it for their subject; as, it snows, it rains. Thiese are
sometimes called impersonal verbs., Uiiersonal, that is, having one person,

* "Every verb, employed in i personal mo(lde, necessarily has a subject. Bit it
very often happens that we are witnesses of effects whose causes are unknown to us,
or that we wish to express the effects without expressing the cause otherwise than

and in languages in which this Pronoun has three Genders we generally take theAUXILIARY VERBS.
AUXILIARY             VERBS.
An auxiliary verb is one which is used                 in conjugating other verbs. They are do, have, be, shall,
will, may, can, and mvust.
Do, be and have are also principal verbs.
DO.
Do is used for emphasis, and also in negative and interrogative sentences
without emphasis. Formerly it was sometimes used in simple affirmative
sentences; as, "The young lions do lack."-Psalz xxxiv, 10. "False witnesses did rise up."-Psalm xxxv, 11. See the quotation f,om Horne Tooke,
qnder the head of "M oods," Remrark 6.
It is sometimes used as a kind of pro-verb, if the expression may be allowed, standing instead of a repetition of some verb which has preceded; as,
" He studies better than you do;" that is, than you study,;
BE.
The verb to be, wvhen used as an auxiliary, connects the subject and the
participle expressing the affirmation.
HAVE.
The use of have as an auxiliary probably originated in its beinlg used to
express the possession of something represented as the object of an action
denoted by the participle; as, " I have money concealed" [by myself;] "I
have concealed money;" that is, money which is concealed, By degrees the
idea of possession has been dropped; and the participle has changed its
mode of signification, so that, instead of being passive, it is now active in
sense, and instead of belonging to the noun, like an adjective, it now governs
it in the objective case, when it is transitive. It has become so entirely
changed that intransitive verbs have this participle, though they cannot have
apassive participle. See fatthiae's Greek Grammar, ~ 559.
SHALL AND WILL.
1. - Shall is from the Anglo-Saxon scealan, the original meaning of which is
to owe. Thus, " Agyf thaet thu me scealt," Pay what thou owest me, [shalt
me.] "Se him sceolde tyn thusend punda," Who owed [should] him ten

Neater. Thus, when we say in English,'it th7unders,''it rains,''it sqnows,' it is
clear that the pronoun'it' denotes in a vague and indefinite manner the Subject of
which the Attribute is thluncdering, raiinig, sno'wing. It is as though we had said,
the cause which produces the thunder, the rain, or the snIow, thunders, rains, or
snows,' "-Fosdick's Translation of De Sacy's General QGramar,
105106
AUXILIARY VERBS.
thousand pounds. Chaucer uses the word in this sense; as, "By the faith I
shall to God;" that is, owe.
2. The originlal meaning may still be traced in the present use of this word;
as, "Thou shalt lanot kill;" that is. thlou owest, art unbder obligyation, not to kill.
"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die;" that,is, thou
owest, art destined, to die. "It shall come to pass;" that is, it owes, is obliged,
is destined, to come to pass.
3. So in the past tense, " Judas Iscariot, which should betray him;" that
is, was destined to betray him. Should is not now used in this manner. e
4. This word is used to denote the obligation or necessity as arising from
the determination of another; as, "You shall write."
5. What one owes, is obligdd, destined, to do, is, oif course, future: the idea
of futturity has prevailed over that of obligation in certain cases; thus, "I
sh8all be compelled to leave my pleasant homie;" " If ye shall see the Son of
Man;" "Before the child shall know;" "Every one who shall be present
will hear."
6. Will expresses will, determination, iclination; as, i" He  ill'write in
spite of my opposition;" that is, is deterimined.
7. What one willz, is determined, to do, must be future; and in the second
and thiird persons the idea of determination is sometimes lost in that of futurity; as, " He will be compelled to leave his pleasant home."
8. The mode of expressing simple futurity in English lihas arisen from attributing the future event to the obligatior- or necessity, as far as the person
who foretells is concerned, and to determination on the part of others.
9. The foreigner, who, when drowning in the Thames, cried out, "I will
drown, nobody shall help me," should have said, " I shall drown, nobody
will help me;" that is, according to the original meaning of the words, I am
in such circumstances that I am obliged to drown, nobody has the will to
help.
10. Errors are sometimes committed by the most distinguished writers
with respect to the use of shall and will. Thus,
"We have much to say on the subject of this Life, and wvill often find ourselves obliged to dissent firom the opinions of the biographer."- T. B. Maa
caulay; Art. on Bacon.
The writer intends by will find to express simple futurity, and as the future action is to be performed by the person who foretells, shall find should
be ugd. The writer, withoutt intending it, has expressed his determinatimo
to find himself obliged to dissent
"If weconsider the influence exerted by the point Daghesh on the sylla.
ble preceding it, we will perceive that," etc.-obrdheimer; Hebrew Grammar.
This is incorrect for the same reason.
11. The assertions of Mr. Murray, Dr. Webster, and other gratnmarians,

107
sons, prom/es, mmands, or threatens; and that will in the second and third
persons, onlyforetells, should be received with considerable miodification.
We will consider these words, 1. as expressing resolution; and 2. as expressing futurity.
RESOLUTION.
12. Shall expresses a resolution or promise of an individual
cohcerning the actions, etc., of others.    When the first person
is represented as expressing the resolution, shall is used in reference to the actions, etc., of the second and third persons, and
will in reference to those of the first. Thus:
-I will write.
Iam resolved, Ipromise, etc., that.....   You shall write.
He shall write.
Note.-When these formns do not depend on a preceding clause, it is always the first person that expresses the resolution.
13. When a question is asked, the resolution, etc., of thea
second person is referred to; accordingly, shall is used in the
first and third persons, and will in the second.     Thus
1. Shall I write?                 2. Will you write?
3. Shall he write?
These forms are equivalent to "Are you resolved," or " Are you willing
that I shall write' etc.
14. The principle may be further seen in the following examples:
I shall write.
You are resolved, yo promise, etc., that You will write.
He shall write.
I shall write.
He is resolved, etc., that..............  You shall write.
He will write.
Will write is used when he refers to the person who has formed the resolution; in reference to another it would beshall write; as, "c He is resolved
that John shall write."
15. Will may express a resolution of the sulject oqf the veirb in all the persons. Thus,
I wil1 write.
I spite qf opposition.................  You will write.
He will write.108                     AUXILIARY VERBS.
FUTUIRITY.
16. To express simple futirity, shall is applied to the future
actions, etc., of the person who is represented as foretelling or
supposing the future events, and will to those of others.
Shall, however, is used in the first person, even when others
are represented as foretelling.
I shall be elected.
I believe, I hope, etc., that.............   You will be elected.
He will be elected.
Or, without any dependence on a preceding clause,
I shall be elected..........You will be elected...........He will be elected.
I shall be elected.
You believe, you hope, etc., that........ You shall be elected.
He will be elected.
I shall be elected.
eevs,he hoe e. a    You will be elected.
He believes, he hopes, et., that.......  He shall be elected.
Johnl will be elected.
Interrogatively.
Shall I be elected?........ Shall you be elected?*....... Will he be elected?
17. Shall is used to denote simple futurity after the conjulnctions if, though,
etc., after the conjunctive adverbs when, until, after, before, etc., and after
relative pronouns, when the relative clause is an essential modification of the
antecedent.  See examples under "Shall and Will," 5. In the example,
" Every onle who shall be present will hear," the relative clause, who shall be
present, is an essential modification of the anltecedent; it is not every one who
will hear, but every one who shall be present. " Whosoever shall kill shall
be in danger of the judgment." Here, whosoever shall kill is an essential
modification of the antecedent (person) understood.
SHOULD AND WOULD.
18. In general, should and would have the same reference to
obligation and will, that the present tenses shall and will have.
Thus:
" Thou art the Christ which should come into the world;" that is, was
* Dr. Webster says, "Shall you go? asks for information of another's intention."
It appears to me that this use of the phrase is a provincialism, Will you go? asks for
Information of another's intention,AUXILIARY VERBS.
destined * to come. "In spite of opposition he would go;" that is, was determined.
19. When a present or future tense would be followed by
shall, a past tense is followed by should; if the present or
future would be followed by will, the past is followed by would.
Thus
I will write.                   I would write.
I promise thlat.  You shall write.  I promised that.. You should write.
He shall write.                 He should write.
I shall write.                  I should write.
You promise that Yotu will write.  You promised that You would write.
He shall write.                 He shouzld write.
I shall belecte.                 I shold e elected.
I believe that Youll will be elected.  I believed that You would be elected.
He will be elected.             He would be elected.
These words are often used to express conditions, etc. See " Remarks on
the Tenses in the different Moods."
20. A clause expressing a condition or supposition may leave
it uncertain whether the thing supposed does or does not, will
or will not, exist; or, it may imply that it does not exist; or,
it may refer to past time and imply that it did not exist. Thus,
"If he has a pen," leaves it uncertainll whether he has or has
not a pen; "If he had a pen," implies that he has not a pen;
"If he had had a pen," implies that he had not.
When shall would be used in a conditional clause of the first
kind, or in the clause that expresses the conclusion depending
on the condition, should is used in the corresponding one of ihe
second, and should have in one of the third.  When will would
be used in one of the first kind, would and would have are used
in the second and third. Thus:
"If he has a pen, he shall write;"
"If he had a pen, he should write;"
"If he had had a pen, he should have written."
"If he has a pen, he will write;"
"If he had a pen, he would write;"
"If he had had a pen, he would have written."
* Should is not now used in this manner.
109110                     AUXILIARY VERBS.
21. The conclusion often stands without a conditional clause, butt with a
tacit reference to some condition; as, "I should be pleased to hear him,"
[if I had the opportunity.]  "Such an event would be very distressing," [if
it should happen.]
22. Hence it is that should and would are used to express a softened assertion: thus, instead of saying, "I doubt his candor," we sometimes say, " I
should doubt his candor," as if thlere were a condition implied, "If I could."
So, "It would seem to be necessary," is a softened mode of expressing, "It
seems to be necessary."
23. Should and would do not always imply the non-existence of the thing
supposed.
24. Should often denotes merely a supposed future event, and in this sense
is used in all the persons, as, "If I should be elected, I will accept the
office."'
25. ShoulZ is used in an indefinite sense, after the conjunction that; as, "I
am surprised that he should act so."
26. Should is often used in all the persons to denote present oblhgation or
duty. "John shall write," has come to imply a resolution on the part of
some one, and should is used with the original meaning of shall; as, " John
should write;" that is, owes, is under o~ligation, to write.
27. To express a past obligation, a change is made, not in should, but in
the verb with which it is connected; as, " John should have written yesterday."-See " Remarks o7e the Tenses in the diferent Moods," 16, 17.
28. So, would is sometimes used with a present signification to denote a
will or wish; as, "When I would do good, evil is present with me."
29. Will is sometimes used in the present, and would in the past tense, to
denote a repeated or customary action; as, "He will sometimes spend whole
houls there;" "He would sometimes spend whole hours there."
"These things to hear,
Would Desdemona seriously incline;
Butt still the house affairs wvould draw her thence;
Which ever as she could with haste despatch,
She'd come a,ain."-Shakspeare.
MAY, CAN AND MUST, MIGHT AND COULD.
30. May had originally the significationl that can now has; as, "- I may all
thyngis in him that comforteth me."- Wicklif.
31. It was sometimes written mosve,* and was not confined to the present
ndl past tenses. Thus, Wicklif says,
" Many seeken to entre; and they schulen not mowe;" that is, shall not
may, or be able.
* A achet which shows that words now in use among the common people only, are
not always corruptions, is, that the old fomin mought is still used in some places for
might. This word occurs frequently in old writers; thus,
"Winter and summer they mought well fare."-Spenser.AUXILIARY VERBS.
11i
" Which thou shalt mowe suffre."-Ckhaur.
"Despoiled of mong to do yvel," [of maying, being able, to do evil.]O7aucer.
32. This word now generally denotes power as granted by some one, that
is, liberty or permission.
33. With the perfect infinitive, and sometimes with the imperfect or present, it denotes possibility; ats, "He may have written;" that is, it is possible
that he wrote, or has written. " He may write, perhaps;" here may denotes
possibility. See "Remarks on the Tenses in the diferent Maoods," 68, 69.
34. The original meaning of can is to know; as, " I can but smal grammere."-Chaucer.
So, in the past tense,
"A few termes couzde he, two or three,
That he had learned out of some decree."-Chaucer.
35. Like may, it was not confined to the present and past tenses of the indicative mood: thus, Chautcer says, " She should not con ne mowe attaine:"
that is, She should nlot know how. nor be able, to attain.
36. With respect to some things, to know how is to be able to do them; thus,
"I know how to read," and, " I am able to read," convey the same idea.
Hence can came to denote the idea of ability, while its signification of
knowledge has gradually disappeared.
37. Might and could have, in general, the same relation to may and can,
that coutld and would have to shall and will.
88. Must denotes necessity. When it is used to denote a past necessity, a
change is made in the verb with which it is colnnected; as, " I determined to
tell him, for he must have learned it some time or other:" that is, he was
necessitated to learn it.
89. But this is not the usual signification of must with the perfect infinitive.
" He must have written this letter," means, it is necessary to believe that he
wrote it; not, he was necessitated to write it.

Remark.-These sentences may be corrected as follows: " I will be compelledcl to go home," is incorrect, because the first person foretells an event
which is to happolen to himself, and in that case shall must be used. " I am
resolved that I shall dclo my duty," is wrong, because it is intended to express
a resolution of the first person with regard to his own actions, and in that
case wil must be used, etc.

RULE V.-A verb agrees with its subject in number and person.
" John can write a lette/'."
Can write is a verb; irregular - its past tenlse and participle do not end in
ed - present write, past wrote, participle written; transitive, etc.; active
voice, etc.; potential mood-it asserts thle power of performling an action;
present tense, etc., etc.
[Better thus. Seepage 75, Note to Remark 9.]

PREP OS I T ION.
A  preposition is a word which shows the relation
between a noun or pronoun and some other word;
as,
"The hatred of vice;" " This book will, be usefuil to John;"
"He lives for glory;" " He acts consistently with his priinci-.
pies."

Here of shows the relationl between vice and hatred; to, between John and
useful; for, between glory and lives; with, between jrinci]ples and consistently.
The preposition and the noun form         what is called an adjunct; thus, of vice is an adjunct to hatred; to John is an
adjuncet to useful; for glory, to lives; with his princilges, to
consistency.
The words that modify the noun are considclered as belonginlg to the adjunct. In this sentence, "He lives in the greatest seclusion," in the greatest
seclusion is an adcljunct to lives.
The same word may have several adjuncts; thls, "The stream runs with
rapidity past the house, under tlhe fence, into the river;" that is,
T with rapidity,
The streamruns  past the house,
under the fence,
iinto the river.

PREPOSITION.
lNotwit]1standing consists of the adverb not and the participl withstacnding,
which may be construed like during.
Except was originally a verb in the imperative mood; thus, " They all
peristied excepgt one;" tilat is, take out onle. The word save may also be
parsed either as a verb or a preposition.
Some parse out of as two words--out as an adverb, and of as a preposition.
But in the sense of except is somietimnes used as a preposition; as,
"The boy stood on the burning deck,
Whence all but 7bin had fled."--emoass.
Some would say but he, and if but were what it was originally-the imperative mood, this construction would be correct; he wouLld be nominative to
but. But to consider but a conjunction makes an awkward construction,
"Whence all had fled, but he had not fled."  Bcutan is sometimes a preposition in Anglo-Saxon; as, "'Butan wifum and cildum," without or besides
women and children. W/fum and cildum are in the dative or ablative case.
Some of the words in the list are not always prepositions. See list of words
used as diferent parts of speech.
When the objective case is omitted after prepositions, they are commonly
called adverbs; thuts, "He returned from his journey, and died soon after;"
that is, after that time.
"The king of France with forty thousand men,
Marched up a hill, and then marched downl again;"
that is, down the hill.

Remarkls.--1. An adverb is an abridged expression for an adjunct; thus,
cautioesly means in a cautious manner; remarkably means in a remarkable
degree; anld more meanlls in a greater degree. So, here is equivalent to in thi8

almost, perfectly.
Here, there, somewhere, anywhlere, hither, thither, thence,

Now, then, to-day, anciently, hereafter.
Hitherto, henceforth, always, never.
Remarks.-1. Adverbs are generally used for those adjuncts only whllichl
are joined to verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; butt they are sometimes used
for those which are joined to nouns or pronouns; as, " John saw thim only."
I-Her the adverb only dcloes not modify the verb saw, but the pronounl him;
that is, it is used instead of an adljunct to him-" John saw him, withoitt any
other person."
2. In this sentence, " John only saw him,"7 only modifies saw; the meaning is, Johnl saw him, without doing any thing else-without speaking to him,
or without hearing him.
3. If we place the emphasis on John, only will modify John; thus, " John
only saw him," means that John andcl no other person saw him; John witthout any other person.
4. The adverbs used to qualify nouns are chiefly those which may refer to
the exclusion or addition of objects, such as, chilfly, particularly, especiall/y,
entively, altogether, solely, onZly, mrerely, partZy, also, likewise. Thuts, "He
studies grammar ch.iqfely;" that is, grammarfobr the most part, grammar alsmost
to the exclusion of other stldies.  " He studies geology, and gramnar also;"
that is, grammar in addition.
5. Adverbs sometimes modify adjuncts; as, "I He dwells far beyond St.
Louis " "The steamboat sta'ts long before noon."
6. Some adcljuncts in which the lnoutn is omitted are called adverbial
phrases; such are in short, in general, in vain, at most, at least, at all, on
high.
CLASSES OF ADVERBS.
Adverbs may be divided iniito three classes.

II.  Adverbs of TIME; as iow, to-day, instantly, immediately, already, recently, since, before, ago, yesterday, hlitherto,
to-morrow, hereafter, henceforth, soon, always, ever, never,
eternally, continually, often, again, frequently, sometimes, daily,

III.  Adverbs of MANNER, DEGREE, etc.; as, well, wisely,
happily, justly, gloriously, slowly, prudently, bravely, much, too,
very, greatly, highly, entirely, perfectly, excessively, enlouglh,
sufficiently, how, however, so, perhlaps, possibly, yes, yea, verily,
truly, surely, certainly, really, doubtless, indeed, why, wherefore, therefore, more, most, less, least, thus, as, no, not, nay.
Remarks.-1. Adcverbs of mainner are generally formed from adjectives
by adding ly,'for like; thus, just, justly.
2. In general, when an adjective ends in ly ino adverb is formed friom it;
but an adjunct is used to express tlhe idea; thus, "He acted in a mzanly
manner," not manlily.
3. NSAy, szo, and not are called negative adverbs; ncay is nlearly obsolete;
no is genlerally used to denote denial in the answer to a question, and seems
to stand for not, and the sentence contained in the question, the necessary
changes for person, etc., being made. Thus, " Will you go?I " LVo;" that
is, I will not go. lt may be considered simply as used for not, the rest of
the sentence being understood.
Yes is generally used to denlote assent in the answer to a question, and
may be considcered as modifying some word in a manner similar to no.
4. Here, there, and wslere are sometimes compoulnded with prepositions to
form other adverbs; as, hereby, thereby, w?hereby, therefore, (therefor), whereJbre, wherewith, therewith.
5. Therefore, wherefore, and also are sometimes called conjunctions; but
they are evidently adverbs; they are used for the adjuncts, for the reason,
for which reason, in addition.

the   antecedent:       these    are   called   conyunctive    adverbs.
Thus, "I shall see you when you come;" that is, at the time
at which you come.     "He will remain while you are absent;"
that is, during the time dturing which you are absent.           "The
book is not where I left it;" that is, in the place in which I
left it.
Remarks.-1. It would seem that each of these adverbs modifies two
words; the adjunct containing the antecedent modifies one, and that containing the relative modifies the other. Thus, in the first example, when
modifies shall see and come.
2. In reality, these words are like the relative with the antecedent omitted; the antecedent adverb or adjunct being omitted. Thus, the first example is equivalent to, "I shall see you then, or at the time, when you
come."
"It placed was
There ohere the mouldered earth had caved the bank."-Snpenser.
"Before I go whence I shall not return," is equivalent to "Before I go to
the place whence, orfrom which, I shall not returnl."  "When a few years are
come, then I shlall go the way whence I shall not returnl."--Bible.
3. The words which are used as conjunctive adverbs, are such as when,
where, while, whither, 5whence.
4. These words are nlot always conjunctive adverbs; some of them are
sometimes used instead of adjuncts conltaining interrogative pronouns; as,
" When (at what time) will he come?"  So ia indirect questions; as, " Tell
me when (at what time) he will come."

CONJUNCTION.
A  conjunction is a word which         connects words
or propositiolns; as, c John      and James are happy,
because they are good."
Here and connects the words John and James, and because
connects the propositions, or clauses, "John and James are
happy," and "they are good."
Conjunctions are usually divided into two classes
-copulative and disjunctive.
The   principal   copulative   conjunctions are and,
both, as, because, for, if, since, that.
And is used to connect something as an addition to what
precedes; the others principally serve to connect to the leading
proposition another which expresses a supposition, cause, result, etc.  Both is used with and to mark the connection more
forcibly. And is properly the copulative conjunction.
The   principal   disjunctimve  conjunctions     are  or,
either, nor, neither, than, though, although, yet, but,
except, whether, lest, unless, notwithstanding.
Or is used to connect something as an alternative to what precedes; the others principally serve to connect to the leading
proposition another which expresses a concession, a doubt, or
something opposed to what is expressed in the leading proposition. Either is uised with or as both is with anad; nor and
neither are negative.

DIPHTHONGS--TRIPHTHONGS.
The   semi-vowels    are f, h,,y;     m, n, r, s, v, Z, c
soft, and g soft.
X is a double consonant, equivalent to ks.
Four   of the   semi-vowels, 4     m, n, r, are    called
liqtuids, on account of their smooth, flowing sound.
Remarks.-The vowels represent sotcnds, the consonants   wdificat&amp;s of
sound made by the lips, tongue, palate, etc. Thus, if we make the sound
represented by a, and close the lips, we make that modification of sound
which is represented by p. The mutes close the organs, so that no sound can
be emitted while the organs are in that position; the pure mutes (p, k, t, q,
and c hard,) entirely, the others almost so. The semi-vowels admit the passage of sound through the mouth or the nose. Some of the semi-vowels (as
v and z,) are almost as pure sounds as the vowels. The sounds of the vowels, and the modificationls represented by the conlsonants, are so closely connected, that the most obvious division of words seems to be into syllabl;
and accordingly we find that in the Hebrew, and other early languages, the
letters represented syllables. The division into vowels and consonants was
the result of a more accurate investigation of the elemnents of speech.
DIPHTH ONGS.
Two vowels in immediate successionr in the same
syllable, form     a diphthong; as, ou in found.
A proper diphthong is one in which both vowels
are sounded; as, oi in voice.
An improper diphthong is one in which only one
of the vowels is sounded; as, ea in beat.
TRIPHTH ONGS.
Three vowels in immediate succession in the
same syllable, form        a triphthong;' as, eau in beau.
A proper triphthong is one in which all the vowels are sounded; as, uoy in buoy.

4. As an inteejection-" What! warder, ho!"
Remarks.-l. Bvt is an adverb when only may be used in its place; as,
"Our light afflictionl, which is but (only) ior a momenelt." But has been
made to assume this mieaning by the omission of the negative which was
originally used with it; thus, " Our light affliction which is not but (except)
for a moment."
2. Sonime grammarians assert that trwt, in all those cases in which it is supposed to be a conjuncetion. is merely a pronoun standilng for a sentenlce or
part of a sentence; or rather a limiting adjective. This sentence, "I wish
you to believe that I would not willingly hurt a fly," is resolved thus: " I
woutld not willingly hurt a fiy; I wish you to believe that [assertion;"] "; I
wish you to believe that [assertion] I would not willinigly htLrt a fly."
That in its origin is Ihe passive participle of the Anglo-Saxon verb thean,
to tace, to assume; but the derivation, and the iancient mnode of using a word,
do not always show how it is used at presenlt; though a knowledge of them
may be useful for this purpose, and may show how present usage originated.
T7at, as a conjunction, is merely a connective, or, if the expression may be
allowed, an introduction to a clause, anld dcloes not refer to asertio2n, or fact,
etc. The following is a correct English sentence: " I wish you to believe
this assertion, that I would not willingly lhurt a fly."  How would a sentenace
of this kind appear when resolved in the modcle adopted by Horne.Tooke and
others? " I wish you to believe this assertion, that [assertion] - would not
willingly hurt a fly."
8. In such sentenlces as the following, so and as are usually considered
conjunctions; " Shle is as amniable as her sister;" ". As two are to four, so are
six co twelve;" " No lamb was e'er so mild as he;" " He acted as he was directed."  Butt in all these sentences as and so are adverbs, being used instead
of adjuncts. Tohus, " She is amiable in the same degree in which her sister
is;" " Six are to twelve in the proportion in which two are to four;" " No
lamb was e'er mild in the degree in which he is."  As, in the last sentence, is
a conjsnctive adverb; thus, " He acted in the manner in which he was directed
to act."

SYNTAX.
SYNTAX treats of the arrangement of words in
propositions, and their relation to each other.
A  proposition consists of a subject and       a predicate.
The subject of a proposition is that of which
something is affirmed.
The predicate is that which is affirmed of the
subject.   Thus, "1 John    runs."    Here John is the
subject, and runs is the predicate.
Note 1.-The word afirmn must be understood to include interrogations,
commands, etc.
Note 2.-The name of the object addressed does not form a part of the
proposition: thus, " William, John runs."
Note 3.-In interrogations, the subject often comes after the verb; thus,
" What says the preacher?"
EXERCISES.
1. Name the subject and predicate in each of the following propositions.
Peter jumps. God exists. Virtue will triumph. I can
write. Children play. Children love to play. Vice is pernicious. He is happy. Happy is he. Diana is great. Great
is Diana. Blessed are peacemakers. Gratiano has gone along
with him. With him has Gratiano gone along. In their ship
Lorenzo is not.  What is man?    Who art thou?    Where is
John?   Whither art thou going?    Is happiness to be found
among men?
Go thou.  Go in peace.  Study thou thy lesson.  Study thy
lesson.  Stay with me.  Love virtue.  Honor thy father and
thy mother.
Of what does Syntax treat?  What is the subject of a proposition?
Of what does a proposition consist?  the pred(licate?
What does the word affirm include?SUBJECT.
2. Form a predicate for each of the following subjects.
George.   Virtue.  Industry.   Happiness.   Rain.  Grass.
Horses. Religion. Birds. Knowledge.
SUBJECT.
I. The subject is either grammatical or logical.
The   grammatical subject is either a noun             or
some word standing for a noun. The logical subject consists of the grammatical subject with its
various mnodiications.
Thus, "The conisciousness of a well spent life is pleasant."
Here consciousness is the grammnatical, and the consciousness of
a well spent life the logical subject.
If the grammatical subject is not modified, it is the same as
the logical subject.
Thus, in the proposition, "John runs," John is both the
grammatical and the logical subject.
EXERCISES.
Name the grammatical and logical subjects in the following propositions.
Ripe peaches are excellent.  The love of virtue is commendable.  A beautiful prospect is admired. Unripe apples are not
wholesome.   Wise men avoid temptation. Thomas will study
his lesson. All boys do inot study. All goodc boys study.
Men oftenl do wrong.  Great men often do wrong. Great and
virtuous men often do wrong. Man sins. The man sins. A
Inn- sills.  That man is wicked.  No man is perfect.

128
How many kinds of subjects?II. The subject is also either simple or compound.
A simple subject is a single noun, or word standing for a noun, either alone or variously modified;
as, "Life is short;" "The longest life of man is
short."
A compound subject consists of two or more simple subjects
to which one predicate belongs; as, " The moon and stars
shione;" " Two and three nmakle five;" " This most excellent
man, and that consummate villain, were born in London."
EXERCISES.
1. Tell whether the subject in each of the following propositions is simple or

SUBJECT.MODIFIED SUBJECT.
MODIFIED        SUBJECT.
Words are said      to  modify or limit others, when
they serve to explain, describe, enlarge, restrict,
or otherwise qualify their meaning.
A   grammatical subject may be modified or
limited in different ways:
1. By a noun, in the same case, annexed to it for the sake of
explanation or description; as, "John the Baptist came."
2. By a noun or pronoun in the possessive case; as, "Milton's writings are sublime;" " My brother is here."
3. By an adcljuncet; as, "The love of learning is commendable."
4. By an adctjective or participle; as, "Envious time flies;"
"The flowers fade;" "All men die;" "A horse neighs;" " He,
shouting, made the onset."
5. By a relative pronoun, and the words connected with it;
(a relative clause;) as, "The boy who studies will improve."
6. By an infinitive; as, "A desire to learn is praiseworthy."'
7. By an entire clause; as, "A     belief that God is merciful
affords consolation."
Remark.-A    noun may be modified in any of the ways above nmentioned, evein when it is not the gramnmatical subject; as, " Johln the Baptist."
Here Baptist is modified by the. " The love of sound learniin is commendable." Here learninq is modified by sound. " I know his devotion to the
study of the works of nature."  Here devotiorn is modified by the adjunct to
the study; study is mlodified by of the works; and works by of nature.

MODIFIED ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, EaTC.
An adjective     modifying a noun may itself be
modified:
1. By an adjunct; as, " A pen is usefulfor writing."
What is the first way in which an adjective may be modified?
131INFINITIVES, ETC., AS SUBJECTS.
2. By an adverb; as, "That very large tree has fallen."
3. By an infinitive; as, "He is ready to go."
An adverb may be modified:
1. By another adverb; as, " M/ore openly."
2. By an adjunct; as, "Agreeably to nature."
A  compound grammatical subject, considered as one complex idea, may itself be modified; as, "All bad books are pernicious;" "The first two verses were sung."
All modifies not books alone, but the complex idea bad books;
first modifies two verses.
EXERCISES.
1. By what are the adjectives modified in the following propositions?
Ajax was mighty in arms.      He led a very unhappy life.
That poem   is exceedingly beautiful.  Demosthenes was superior to Eschines in eloquence.   John is ready to recite.  He
was extremely idle.  This is wonderful to be related.
"Here rests his head upon the lap of earth
A youth to fortune and to fame unIknown."
2. By what are the adverbs in the following propositions modified?
He was very highly esteemed. He was most ardently devoted to study.  James is much more happy niow. That book
was published very recently. William studies best of all. He
returned long before night.
8. How is the grammatical snbject in the following propositions modified?
All bad men will be punished. All good boys love their
parents. All men of integrity are respected. The black dog
bites.
INFINITIVES, ETC., AS             SUBJECTS.
An irnfinitive, a participle used as a noun, or an
entire clause, may be the subject of a proposition;
What is the second way in which an ad- What dloes all modify in this sentence,

How may an adverb be modified?
132INFINITIVES, ETC., AS SUBJECTS.
133
as, " To lie is base;" "Lyinyg is base;" " That men
should lie is base."
So also a clause, consisting of an infinitive, with
its suLbject in the objective preceded        by for; as,
" For men to lie is base."
The verbs and participial noutns in such cases may be modified
like the verb of a predicate.  See the article " Modified Predicate" p. 135.  Thus, "To hate our enemies is forbidden."
The infinitive moodc, the participial noun, the finite verb*
with its subject, and the infinitive with its subject in the objective, mnay be considered the grammatical subjects.  That
and for may be considered as belonging to the subject.
In such cases, when the subject comes after the predicate, the
pronoun it is used; as, "It is base that men should lie."
In this and similar propositions, the word it is not the subject; it serves only to introduce the sentence in a particular
manner.
The word there is often used to introduce a sentence, when
the subject comes after the predicate; as, "There are five men
here."
Note.-In the following pages, when the term su'ect alone is used, the
granmatical subject is intended.
EXERCISES.

An improper triplhthong is one in which all the
vowels are not sounded; as, eau in beauty.
SYLLABLES AND          VWORDS.
A syllable is a letter, or a combination of letters,
uttered at a single impulse of the voice. Thus; in
amen, a constitutes one syllable, and mnen another.
A word is a syllable, or a combination of syllables, used as the sign of some idea.
A word of one syllable is called a monosyllable;
a word of two syllables, a dissyllable; of three syllables, a trisyllable; of four or more syllables, a
polysyllable.
EXERCISES.
Tell which of the following words are monosyllables, which dissyllables, etc.
Twenty, man, happy, unity, school, safety, book, baker, magnanimous, monosyllable, dissyllable, trisyllable, ambiguity, vulture, tough, crucifix, hominily.
A primitive word is one which is not derived
from another word in the language; as, man, holy,
love.
A derivative word is one which is derived from
another word in the language; as, manly, holiness,
loving.
A compound word is one which is composed of
two  or more    words; as, schoolmnaster, laughterloving.
A simple word is one which is not compounded;
as, word, man.
What is an improper triphthong?  What is a primitive word?-a derivative

8PREDICATE.
Four boys are in this class. There are four boys in this class.
A large number was present.   There was a large number present. There were five loaves in the basket.
PREDICATE.
I. The predicate, like the subject, is either
grammatical or logical.
The grammatical predicate is a verb.          The logical predicate consists of the grammatical predicate
with its various modifications.
Thus," Scipio routed the forces of Hannibal."  Here, routed
is the grammatical, and routed the forces of Hannibal the logical
predicate.
Note.-If the grammatical predicate is not modified, it is the same as the
logical.
E X E R C I S E S.
Name the logical an(l grammatical predic-tes in each of the following propositions.
Cicero delivered four orations against Catiline.  Jamnes was
expelled from his kingdom.  Williamn the Conqueror governed
England.  John preached in the wilderness.  The sentinel stars
set their watch in the sky.  Washington was called the Father
of his Country. John walks slowly.
II. The predicate, like the subject, is also either
simple or conpound.
A simnple predicate is one which contains a single
finite verb; as, "Pleasure       is brief;" " They     are
scattered in Eu-rope, Asia, Africa, and America."
A compound predicate consists of two or more
simple predicates belonging to the same subject;
as, "He lacghzs and weeps."
What is the grammatical predicate?  What is a siple preicate?a compound
What is the logical predicate?  e predicate?
134MODIFIED PREDICATE
EXERCISE S,

John  desires to learn.   The devils believe and tremble.
They were commanded to returnl to their own coiuntry.      The
bird chirps and sings.   Honesty is praised and [is] neglected.
He was attacked and [was] slain.     The houses were plundered
and burned.   IIe left his home and went to a foreign land.
He comes in the roar of a thousand storms, and scatters battle
from his eyes.  High on a throne of royal state, Satan exalted
sat.
MODIFIED PREDICATE.
A grammatical predicate may be modified, or
limited, in different ways:
1. By a noun, or pronoun, in the same case as the subject;
as, "He was called John;" " She moves a goddess;" "It is he."
2. By a noun, or pronoun, in the objective case; as, "John
struck Alfred;" "I saw them."
3. By an adjective referring to the subject; as, "Aristides
was called just."
4. By an adjunct; as, "William spoke to Thomas."
5. By an adverb; as, "George learns rapidly."
6. By an infinitive; as, "James wishes to learn."
7. By a dependent clause; as, "Jamnes wishes that you should
learn;" "James wishes you to learn."
Remarks.-1. An infinitive or participle may be modified like the verb
of a predicate.
2. All other words used to modify verbs may themselves be modified in
the ways mentioned under the article " Modified Subject."

SENTENCES.
A sentence may consist either of one proposition,
or of two or more propositions connected together.
A sentence consisting of one proposition is called
a simple sentence.
A  sentence consisting of two or more propositions is called a compound sentence, and the propositions of which it is composed are called mnembers
or clauses.
Thus, "Phocion was poor," is a simple sentence; "Phocion
was poor, though he might have been rich," is a compound
sentence. In this compound sentence, "Phocion was poor,"
and "h le might have been rich," are members or clauses.

Age increases the desire of living. Age increases ti Le desire
of living, though it lessens the enljoyments of liife. Age, though
it lessens the enjoyments of life, increases the desire of living.
He will not be pardoned, unless he repent. They all slumbered while the bridegroom  tarried. While the bridegroom
tarried, they all slumbered.  John's devotion to study, and his
blameless conduct, commanded the approbation of all. I will
go, if you command me.
INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT CLAUSES.
The members of a compound,sentence are either
independent or dependent.
An independent clause is one which makes complete sense by itself.
A  dependent clause is one which makes complete sense only in connection with another cl&amp;use.
Thus, "That man is happy, though he is affected with disease." Here the former clause is independent, the latter dependent.
Remark.-And connects propositions of the same kind, either independent or depenldent; as, "The winds subside and the clouds disperse." So
also the negatives neither and nor; (equivalent to and not;) as, "The winds
did not subside, nor did the clouds disperse."
That member of a compound sentence on which
the other members depend, is called the leading
clause;  its  subject, the   leading subject;    and  its
verb, the leading verb.
What is an independent clause?-a dependent?

ruined.  I did niot see him till he hlad spoken.  No man can
say that he is dishonest. I will not believe that he is dishonest.
That he is dishonest, I will not believe.
CONNE CTION         OF   CLAUSES.
The mnembers of a compound sentence may be
connected by relatives, conjunctions, or adverbs.
Thus, "He is respectedcl by all whlo know him;" "H-Ic fled
whIen danger appeared;" "YouII say that lie is honest."  In the
first sentelne, the relative vwho, besides being the subject of the
verb know, connects the clause to which it belongs to the leading clause; in the second sentence, the adverb when connects
the clauses; in the third, the conjunction that.
An infinitive withl its subject may be united to another clause
without a connective; as, " I believe Johln to be hlonest;" that
is, "I believe that Jolhn is hlonest."
The connecting word is sometimes om,itted; as, "This is the
man I saw;" "Thlou canst iiot say I did it."  Whom is omitted
in the former sentence, anid thlat inl tllhe latter.
Instead of a  ldependent clause connected by a conjunction, a
nouin and a participle sometimes stand as an abridged proposition; as, " The enemy laving been subdued, lie departed;"
that is, when the enemy hlad been subldueld.

ADJECTIVES.
11. -ies here and that there are vulgarisms which should be avoided.
12. The pronoun them should not be used instead of the adjective those;
as, "them books."
13. Singular nouns are sometimes improperly used with numeral adjectives
which denote more than one; as, "Twenty1pousd."
Yet such expressions as twenty head of cattle, a hundred yoke of oxen, ten
sail of vessels, are authorized.
14. Each, every, either, neither, always refer to nouns in the third person
sibgular; and verbs and pronouns referring to them, should, consequently,
be in the third person singular; as, " Each [person] of you has his faults,"not "have your faults."
But such expressions as every three weeks are correct, because the whole ie
taken as one portion of time.
15. Etither and neither cannot properly be applied to more than two objects.,"ither of the three," should be "Asey one of the three;" and "N/either of the
three," shlould be " None of the three."
Dr. Webster says that neither "by usage is applicable to any lnumber referrinlg to indclividcluals separately considered."'
Note.-For the rules concerning the use of the articles, see Articles, p. 40.
16. After some verbs, particularly after certain infinitive verbs, it is often
dlifficult to dclecide whether adjectives or adverbs should be used. After to
be, or to become, it is easy to see that the word shouldcl be an adjective, and not
an adverb; but when other verbs are employed, it is more difficult to decide.
The following directions will enable us to decide correctly in most in
stances.
(1.) The abverb should not be used, if the corresponding acldjunct will nov
convey the intendcled idea.
(2.) When the verb to be and the verb to become can be substituted for any
other, without materially changing the sense or the construction, that other
verb must be connected with an adjective, ahid not Nwith an adverb.
Thus, "The rose smells sweet." It would nlot be correct to say, "The rose
smells sweetly," (in a sweet manner,) because this would represent the rose
as performing the operation of smelling in a particular mannler. We can say,
"The rose is sweet," [to thle smell.]
We often hear persons say, "I feel badly," when they mean that they are
sick. They do not mean that theyfeel in a bad manner, but that they feel
[are] bad; that is, unwell.*

RULE III.
Pronouns      agree    with   their   antecedents in       gender,
number, and person; as,
"This is the friend of whom      I spoke; he has just arrived;"
"Lying is a vice which I despise; it is disgusting."
Note.-For the limitations, explanations, etc., see Etymology.
Remarks.-1. Pronouns sometimes refer to propositions and phrasesas, "She is handsome, and slhe has the misfortune of knowing it;" "You have
overcome envy with glory, which [thing] is very difficult."
2. Pronouns referring to two or more nouns, when the objects are taken
together, should be in the plural; as, " John and James attend to their
studies."
8. The nouns in suchl cases are generally connected by and. But and may
comne botween nouns when the objects are not taken together; as, "John,
(and not James,)* attends to his studies;" "Every book, and every paper, is
kept in its place;" "Each book, and each paper, is kept in its place;" "Nlo
book, and no paper is out of its place."
When the nouns express different characters of the same person, the pronouns should be singular; as, " hlat great statesman and general lost his
life."
4. NVWhlen two or more noluns in the singular, are connected by or or nor,
the objects are not takenl togethler, and the pronoun must be singular; as,
"Eithler John,r James attends to his studies;" " Neithler John nor James
attends to his studics."
5. When the objects mae taken togethler, and the nouns or pronouns are of
diferenet persons, thlle plurall pronounl referring to them mulst be of tlhe first
pe.son, if olne of the anltecedents is of thlle first person; and of the seconld, if
the antecedenlts are of the second and thlird persons; as, " James, and thlou,

7. A singular noun, after many a, may have a plural pronoun; an,
" Full mnany a lady
Have I eyed with best regard; and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hatb into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear."-Shakspea.re.
Buit pronouns in the same clause with the noun must be singular; as,
"Full mnany aflower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air."-Gray.
8. The neuter pronoun it is applied to animals whose sex is unknown or
unnecessary to be regarded. See "Gender," p. 24.
9. The pronoiun it is variously used. For its use with verbs usually called
impersonal, see "I Defective Verbs."  Fobr its quse when an infiitive or a clause
is the subject o1 a v)erb, see " Infinitve n ood, etc., as Subjects," p. 132.
Before the verb to be, it may refer to a noun or pronoun in the predicate of
either the singular or the plural number, and of any person and gender; as,
" It is a man who is coming;" " It is I_;" " It is men who range them;"  It
is books that I love."
In such constructions, it stands instead of the person, the persons, the thing,
etc. Thus, " The person who is coming is a man;"" T"heperson is I," or, "I am
theperson;" " The persons who range them are men;" " The things that I love
are books," or "Books are the things that I love."  But the verb after it is
always of the third person singular. In Chaucer we find, "It amn I."
This word sometimes stands for the state or condition of things; as, "That
it may go well with thee;" "It shall be well with the righteous;" "How
fares it with thee?"
It is sometimes an expletive; as,
"Come and trip it as you go
On the light fantastic toe."--1~ilton.
10. Relatives and interrogatives are placed as near as possible to the beginning of their clauses; as, "This is the man whom I saw;" "' WTVho is this
man?"
In the clauses to which these words belong, the predicate is placed first; so
that the objective case and the predicate nominative precede the verb; whom
is the object of the verb saw, and who is the predicate nominative after is.
11. The relative is sometimes omitted; as, "This is the man [whom] I
saw."  It is generally inelegant to omit therelative in the nominative case;
as, "The captain had several mren in the ship, died of the scurvy."
12. The relative who is applied to persons, and which to things without life,
and to the lower animals; as, "The man who; the book which, the horse which."

14. The relative which is sometimes applied to youlng children; as, "The

Father which art in heaven." The interrogative which is applied to persons
and things indiscriminately; as, "Which man did you see V" "W Tih book did
you read?"
-  15. A collective noun, when it does not refer directly to the individuals
composing the collection, should not be represented by who; thus, we should
not say, "He is on the committee who was appointed;" but that or which was
appointed.
16. The relative which sometimes stands after the proper name of a person;
but, in such cases it refers, not to the person, but to the word; as, "Herodwhich [word] is another name for cruelty."
17. Which sometimes stands after a common noun denoting a person, when
the character and not the person is referred to; as, "He is a good writer,
which [thing] is all that he professes to be."
18. A relative clause usually modifies the antecedent, anld is essential to
it; as, "Boys who do their duty, will be loved."  Here, that may be used for
who. But sometimes the relative clause merely expresses an additional af
firmation, anld who and which are equivalent to and he, aqndl it, etc., or simply
he, it, etc.; as,'" God is the sovereign of the heavens, who gives us every
blessing, and whom we are bound to revere;" "' Ie came to the town Cirta,
which he immediately besieged."  Here the relative that cannot be used.
19. That is used in preference to who or which in the following cases:
(1.) After adcljectives in the superlative degree; as, "Charles XII. was
one of the greatest madmen that the world ever saw."
(2.) After same, very, and all; as, " He is the same man that I saw before."
"He is the very man that did it;" " It was all that he could do."
(3.) After who; as, " Who that knows himn would speak thus?"
(4.) When the relative refers to bothl persons and things; as, " The men
and cities that he saw."
20. That never admits a preposition before it, but it may be the object
of a preposition following it. We calnnot say, " This is the man of that
he spoke;" butt we may say, " This is the man that he spoke qf."  That is
sometimes used when a preposition is omitted; as, "In the day that thou
eatest thereof;" that is, in the day in which.
21. It is inelegant to mingle tlhe solemn and familiar styles in aclddressing
the same object; as, " Aleefa, thou art more beautiful than thle moon on her
fourteenth night, but your wickecldness causes me to hate you."

What is the first case in which that is.150                          PRONOUNS.
22. A change should not be made from one relative to another in the
same connection; thus, it is improper to say, "The man that met us to-day,
and whor you saw yesterday, is the same."  Whom should be changed to
that, or that to who.
23. A relative clause which modifies the subject should not be placed
after a noun in the predicate; thus, " He should not keep a horse that cannot ride," should be, "He that cannot ride, should not keep a horse."
Mr. Murray's seventh rule is, "When the relative is preceded by two
nominatives of different persons, the relative and verb may agree in person
with either, according to the sense; as, " I am the man who command you;"
or, " I am the man who commands you."
There is no necessity for this rule, if the relative clause is in its proper
place. The first sentence quoted should be, " I, who command you, am the
man."  This has a different meaning from " I am the man who commands
you."
24. Pronouns are sometimes made to precede their nouns; as,
".When round the ruins of their ancient oak,
The peasants flocked to hear the miinstrel play."l-Rogers.
25. The English language is deficient in nlot having a pronoun of the third
person sinlgular, applicable to either sex-one that would correspond to the
noun person.
If we wish to refer to a persoin without revealing the sex of that person,
we meet with a dlifficulty; thus, " The person who informed me declared
that (-) was present."  Here, if we use either he or she, we disclose wh-at we
wish to conlceal; we are obliged to resort to an awkward construction--to
repeat the noun, or use both the masculine and feminine pronouns. " If
any man or woman shall violatc his or her pledge, he or she shall pay a fine."
Here is an unlpleasant construction.
This deficiency hlas led to an improper use of the plural pronounl thzey; as,
"TIhe person whlo informed me, declared that they wvere present."
26. IIe, in tlhe singular, is oftenli used insteadcl of the person; as, "II e who is
just, will be rewarded;" that is, thie person who. In the plural, somo use the
corresponding pronoun they, othlers use the adjectivc those, referring to the
noun persons understood; thus,'" Tey or those who are just, will be rewardled."  T7ose is used more frequently thllan they.
27. In the use of pronoutns, care shlould be taken to avoid ambiguity.
T,e followling sentence is ambiguous: " Johnl told James that this was tlhe
iman that he had seen before."' We cannot tell to which of tllhe two nounls,
Joohn and James, the pironoun he refers.

To avoid this ambiguity, the noun is sometimes repeated after the pronoun; as, "John told James that this was the man that he [John,] or that
he [James] had seen before." The idea may be expressed in some other
form; as, " John said to James,'This is the man that I saw before, or, that
you saw before.'

RULE     IV.
The subject of a finite verb is put in. the nommnative
ease; as, " He is studious;" "She is virtuous."
Note.-Any verb, not in the infinitive mood, is called a finite verb. This
term is used in the rule, because the infinitive sometimes takes a subject in
the objective case. See Rule xi.
Remarks.-1. Infinitives, etc., may be the subjects of verbs. See "Infinitives, etc., as Subjects," p. 132.
2. Every nominative, except the cases referred to in Rule vii., must be the
subject of a verb expressed or understood; as, "Who spoke. Eie;" that is,
he spoke.
The following sentence is incorrect: " These evils were caused by Catiline, who, if he had been punished, the republic would not have been exposed
to so great dangers."  Rere who is a nominative without a verb. The idea
may be expressed thus, "' These evils were caused by Catiline, the punishment of whom would have prevented the republic from being exposed to so
great dangers;" or, the sentence may continue in the same form, with who
omitted. "These evils were caused by Catiline; if he had been punllished,"
etc.
"This man, though he has a great amount of knowledge, yet he keeps it
all to himself," should be, "Though this man has," etc.
3. The verb is frequently omitted, particularly in the answers to questiosis,
and after as and than; as, "Who gave you this book? John;" that is,

by a single vowel, double that consonant on receiving a termination beginninig with a vowel.
Thus, blot, blotting, not bloting; allot, allotting, not alloting;
drop, dropped, not droped; shut, shutting, not shuting; quit,
quitting, not quiting.
Note.-In quit, t is preceded by two vowels, but the u has the consonant
sound of w.
Remarks.-1. There are four conditions to be regarded in this doubling.
(1.) The word must be a monosyllable or a word accented on the last syllable.
(2.) The word must end in a single consonant.
(3.) The consonanit must be preceded by a single vowel.
(4.) The termination must begin with a vowel.
Thus the word d(fler does not come under the rule, because it is not a monosyllable, nor accented on the last syllable; consequently we write difering,
differed, etc., with one r.
The word defend is accented on the last syllable; but it does not come
under the rule, because it ends with two consonants, n d; consequently we
write defending, not defenddcing.
The word soil is a monosyllable, and the word recoil is accented on the last
syllable, and each of them ends with a single consonant: but they do not
come ucnder the rule, because the conlsonant is preceded by a diphtlong, and
not by a single vowel; consequently we write boiling, recoiling, with one 1.
The word allotment is spelled with one t, because the termination ment does
not begin with a vowel.
2. The reason for doubling the consonant is that the short sound of the
vowel may be -etained in the derivative. Thus, bloting would be pronounced
like bloatir,' with the long sound of o. In such words as differng, defending, boiling, allotment, the proper soLund is retained without doubling.
3. If the derivative removes the accent to another syllable, the consonant
is not doubled. Thus, refer is accented on the last syllable, fer; but in refarence the accent is removed from fer to another syllable, and the word is
written with one r.
4. In maly words ending in 1, the Z is generally doubled, though the accent is not on the last syllable; as in traveller, modelling, psecilled. So the
derivatives of bias, worship, and kidnap, dclouble s andp; as in biassing, worshipped, kidnapper. But Webster and others spell such words with the consonants single; as, traveler, biased, worshiping.
5. X is not doutbled, because it is a double consonant. Thus, vexing, not
V exxing.
When is it improper to double the last consonant?
10EXERCISES.
4. The subject generally precedes the verb; but it is sometimes placed
after thle verb, or after the first auxiliary; as, "Will he go?" "Go th4;"
" Knowest tho the land?" " Were he good, he woulid be happy;" " Here am
I;" "There is a man;" "Great is Diana;" "Ye shall not eat of it, neither
shlall ye touchl it;" "Said he;" "Began the reverend sage;" "Him followed
his ilext nate."
"Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,
And shook his veryJframe for ire."-Sir W. Scott.
5. Every relative pronoun has a clause of its own, and the antecedent has
no grammatical connection with any word in the relative clause. When the
antecedent is in the nominative case, we must go beyond all the relative
clauses to find its verb.
Thus, " God, by whose kindness we live, to whom nothing is similar, by
whom all things were made, is eternal." If we include each relative clause
in a parenthesis, we shall see the connection of the subject with the verb
more readily; thus, "God, (by whose kindnless we live,) (to whom nothing
is similar,) (by whom all tlhilgs were made,) is eternal."

[Rem. 2.]    Two nouns, when       they   come together, and do
not signify the same thing, the former mutst be in the possessive
case. Virtue, however it may be neglected for a time, men are
so constituted as to respect genuine mlerit.
RIULE V.
A  verb must agree       with   its subject in number and
person;    as,'I write, thou writest, he writes."
Remarks.-i. When an infinitive or a clause is the subject, it requires a
verb of the third person singular.
2. Nominatives have plural verbs in every case in which they would have
plural pronouns, andc singular verbs in every case in which they would have
singular pronlouns. See Rude iii. Remarkcs 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
(1.) When the subject consists of two or more nlominatives taken together,
(in which case they are connected by and expressed or understood,) the verb
must be plural; as, "John and James attend."
The same remark applies to infinitives and clauses used as subjects; as,
"To be rich, and to be happy, are differelnt things."
When the nouns denote but one person, the verb is singular; as, "The
saint, tlle faLther, andcl thle husband)rasays."'-Burns.
(2.) If tlhe singular nominatives between whichl and is placed, are not taken
together, the verb is singular; as, " John, and nlot James, at'ends; "John, tld
James also, attends."  In eachl of these sentences, Jo/in is tllhe subject of acttendds, and James is the subject of the verb cattends underistood. Thus, " John
attends, and James attends not;" " John attends, ancd James also attends."
The verb whicla is expressed agrees, of course, wvithl tlhe nominative that
belongs to it; if that nomninative is plural, tllc verb should be plural, etc.; as,
"Eiends, not merit, cause his promotion."'

(3.) When two or more singular nominatives are connected by or or nor
the objects are taken separately, and the verb is singular; as, "John or
James attends;" " Neither John nor James attends."
(4.) Collective nouns in the singular may have verbs in the plural, when
the reference is to the individuals composing the collection; as, "The multitude eagerly pursue pleasure;" that is, the persons composing the multitude.
When a collective noun denotes the collection as one body, the verb must
be singular; as, "The company was large."  Here we do nlot mean that the
persons composinlg the company were large.
(5.) A nominative after many a demands a singular verb; as, " Full mann
a.flower is born."
Note.-In the plural, the verb is the same in all the persons; and hence
the principle in Remark 5, under Rule iii. is not applicable to verbs.
3. When the nominatives connected by or or nor, are of different persons
or numbers, the verb agrees with the nominative next to it; as, "Either thou
or I am concerned;" " I or thou art to blame;" "Neither you nor he is in
fault;" "Neither poverty nor riches were injurious to him."
In general, it is better not to use such constructions as these. A verb is
supposed to be understood with each of the nominatives, except that which
is next to the verb; and it is generally better to express it, or to use some
other form for conveying the idea. Thus, "Either thou art concerned, or I
am;" or, " One of us is concerned;" " I am to blame, or thou art;" or, " Oine
of us is to blame;".or, "The blame rests on me or thee;" " He was injured
by neither poverty nor riches," etc.
4. Every finite verb not in the imperative mood should have a subject expressed, except when the verb is colnnected to another.
The following sentence is incorrect; "The whole is produced as.anr illusion of the first class, and hopes it will be found worthy of patronage." Here
hopes is connected to is produced, and the whole is represented as hoping, etc.
It should be, "and he hopes," etc.
"Any personl finding the spectacles, and will return them to the Galt
House, shall be liberally rewarded."  Here person is the subject of shall be
rewvarded, and will return has nlo subject. It should be, "Anly person who
shall find the spectacles, and return them," etc.
Note.-The subject is sometimes omitted when it is the antecedent to a
relative pronounl. See p. 50, etc.
5. The adjuncts of the nominative should not affect the form of the verb;
thus, "The number of oysters increases;" not increase. "The ship, with all
the crew, was lost;" not were.
In what number must be verb be when   zor are of different persons, with which
two or more singular nominatives are  must the verb agree?

in the last sentence there is but one nominative, ship, which is singular,
and requires a singular veTb. Some writers use the plural form in such
cases, but they should not be imitated. In most cases it is better to use and,
with a plural verb; as, "The ship and all the crew were lost."

RULE VI.
A noun or pronoun in the predicate, cafter ctny but
ct transitive verb in the cttive voice, is pttt in -he same
case as the subject, wuhen it dclenotes the scme person or
thing; acs, " I anm  he;"   Stephen dciecd a martyr;"
"He was called Johin "'     I took it to be hinzm."
What Is the rule for a noun in the predicate?
159160              PREDICATE NOMINATIVE, ETC.
Note.-In the last sentence it is the subject of the infinitive to be, [See
RIule xi.,] and is in the objective case; for this reason, him, in the predicate,
is put in the objective case.
Remarks.-1. The predicate nominative is sometimes placed before the
verb, and the subject after the verb, particularly when the predicate is an
interrogative pronoun; [See Rule iii. Remark 10;] as, "Who is he?"  "A
train-band captain eke was he."-Cowper.
There is an error in the following sentence: "W Thom do men say that I
am?" If the subject and predicate were placed in their usual order, the
sentence would be, "Do men say that I am whom?"  Whom should be who,
because the subject lis in the nominative.
Note.-It will often help us to understand the construction of sentences,
if we use some other word instead of the interrogative; thus, "Do men say
that Tam he?"
A person referring to two men in companywith each other, asks, "Which
is the governor?"  Here which is the subject; the answer would be, "This
is the governor."
2. In relative clauses, in indirect questions, and in some other cases, both
nominatives are placed befbre the verb  as, "He is not the same man that he
was;" "Tell me who he is;" "The dog it was that died."-Goldsmith.
3. When a question is made without an interrogative pronoun, and a simple form is used, both nominatives are placed after the verb; as, "Is he a
student?"  If a compound form is used, the subject is placed after the first
auxiliary, and the ptedicate nominative after the rest of the verb; as, " Has
he been a student?"'
4. The form of the verb is not affected by the predicate nominative; the
subject and the verb may be of a different person or number from that of the
predicate nomninative; as, "Thou art he;" "Words are wind;" "His meat
was locusts."
We may change such sentences as the last, so as to make the predicate
nominative the subject, without materially changing the sense; as, "Locusts
were his meat." In the sentence, "Locusts were his meat," we affirm something of the subject locusts.
In the following sentence, waters and clouds are supposed to form the subject; "His pavilion were dark waters and thick clouds of the sky;" that is,
"Dark waters and thick clouds of the sky were his pavilion."
Such form  as "His pavilion were," etc., are not agreeable to the ear.
It is often better to express the idea in a different way; thus, "Dark
waters and thick clouds of the sky formed his pavilion;"' or, "His pavilion
was formed of dark waters and thick clouds of the sky;" "' His meat consisted of locusts," etc.
Is the predicate nominative always placed When are both nominatives placed after
after the verb?                     the verb?

In this sentence, " The wages of sin is death," wages is generally said to be
plural, and death is considered the subject; but wages is used as singular in
King James's translation; as, "He that earneth wages, earneth wages to
put it in a bag with holes."-.Haggai i. 6.
5. The infinitive, when used simply as the noun-form of the verb, differs,
in construction, from the finite verb in no respect but in having no subject.
It has an object when the finite verb has  it is modified in the same way by
adverbs and adjuncts; it has an adjective after it when the finite verb has;
in short, it has every thing after it, that is in the predicate, that the finite
verb has9 and differs from the finite verb only in wanting what goes before,
that is, the subject. Thus:
He killed a man,                     To kill a man;
He killed a man maliciously with a  To kill a man maliciously with a
sword,                              sword
He is good,                          lo be good.
Ie'nee,"the infinitive. may have a predicate nominative, though it cannot
have a subject nominative; as, " To become a grammarian requires study;"
" He wishes to be an o7lcer;" "He affects to be a lord;" "He hopes to be
elected governor;" "It is supposed to be h7e."
A noun or pronoun, after the infinitive of an intransitive or passive verb,
is the predicate nominative, except when the infinitive has a subject in the
objective.
Such expressions as, To be taught gr&amp;ammar, To be allowed a seat, are also
excepted. See Rule ix. Remark.
The same general principle is seen in the constructionl of the participle;
thus, "I have some recollection of his father's being a judge."  Here judge
is the predicate nominative. See Rule xiii.
Dr. Bullions supposes the noun or pronoun, in such cases, to be in the objective; as, " To be the slave of passion, is of all slavery the most wretched."
He supposes the following sentences to be correct: "II He was not sure of its
being me;" " Its being mne needs make no difference in your determination."
Me in each of these sentences ought to be I.
Dr. B., to support his views, refers to a Latin and Greek idiom, according
to which the accusative is used after the infinitive of intransitive and passive
verbs. But this idiom does not correspond to the English. In the Latin
and Greek languages, the infinitive takes a subject in the accusative so generally, that there is always a reference to this construction, and adjectives
and nouns after these verbs are generally put in the accusative, except in
cases of attraction, to agree with the subject expressed or understood. In
the English language, however, it is not a general principle that the infinitive takes a subject. But Dr. B. makes the objective to be used more freIn what respect does the infinitive dliffer I  the infinitive of an intransitive or pasin construction from the finite verb?    sive verb?

quently in English, than the accutsative is even in Greek. In such a phrase,
for instance, as, " On account of his being a man," he would consider man in
the objective, while, in the Greek, the corresponding word may be in the
nominative. (Dia to anthropos einai.)
Mr. G. Brown quotes this sentence, " To affect to be a lord in one's closet
would be a romantic madness f;' and says, " In this last sentence, lord is in
the objective after to be; and madness in the nominative after would be."
Mr. Brown does not take the ground that the noun, after the infinitive or
an intransitive or passive verb, is always in the objective; hence I cannot
discover on what principle he supposes lord to be in the objective. Can it be
that he supposes it to be in this case, because it comes after the transitive
verb to affect? It is certainly not the object of that verb; and the words
that follow the infinitive are not at all affected by the word on which the infinitive depends. If such phrase as the following were used, " To affect to
kill a lord," lord would be in thb objective, because to kill is transitive, and
not because to affect is.
The German language, in the use of the infinitive, resembles the English
more than the Latin and Greek do. In that language, the nominative, and
not the accusative, is used after the infinitive of intransitive and passive verbs;
as, " Der (not den) Sclave der Leidenschaft zu seyn," To be the slave of passion; "Der Ruf ein guter Prinz zu seyn," (not cinen guten Prinzen,) The
reputation of beig (to be) a good yri_e.*

his excellent Grammar, p. 146, hlas reasoned the case, and showvn clearly, by reference
to a similar construction in Gernan, which has a closer analogy to the English than

RULE    VII.
The nominative case is sometimes used without a
verb.
This takes place:
1. When an address is made; as, "Plato, thou reasonest
well."
2. In mere exclamations; as, "0 the times!      0 the manners!"
3. When the attention is directed to an object before an
affirmation is made respecting it; as,
" The Pilgrim Fathers, where are they?"
4. When a noun and a participle are used instead of a dependent clause; as, "Shame being lost, all virtue is lost;" that
is, when shame is lost.
Remarks.-1. A noun used in this way with a participle is said to be in
the nomirnaative case absolute. When an address is made, the name of the object addressed is usually said to be in the nomrinative case independent. Times,
nmanners, and Fathers may also be said to be in the nominative case independent.

RiULE VIII.
A  noun in the possessive case limits the meaning of
another noun; as, " John's book; his book."
Remarks.-1. The name of the object possessed is sometimes omitted,
when it may be easily supplied. With the pronouns ours, yours, etc., it is
never expressed. [See "Personal Pronouns," Remarks 1, 2.]
Thus, "This book is Henry's [book];" "This is a book of Henry's
[books];" "This book is yours [book];"* "This is a book of yours
[books];" " He is at the governor's [house]."
2. The apostrophe is never used with pronouns.
3. The relation of possession may be denoted by the preposition qf, with
the objective; thus, "My father's house," and "The houtse of myfather,"
express the same idea.
But of does not always denote possession. "A crown of gold," signifies
"A crown made of gold," "A house of representatives," signifies "A
house consisting of representatives."  In such cases the possessive cannot
be used.
4. When the idea may be expressed by either of these forms we should
use that by which we may avoid harshness and ambiguity. Thus, instead
of "his son's wife's sister," we should say, "the sister of his son's wife;"
What is the rule for the possessive In what other way may the relation of
case?                            possession be denoted?
Is the name of the object possessed always When the idea may be expressed by

used?
* If the noun were expressed, yours would be your.166                         EXERCISES.
instead of " the distress of the son of the king," we should say, " the distress
of the king's son."
" The love of God," may denote either the love which God feels, or the
love which is felt towards God; but " God's love," denotes only the love
which God feels.
5. When two or more nouns are used as the designation of one individual,
the possessive termination is added to the last; as, " Paul the apostle's advice;" "General Washington's tent;" "Smith the bookseller's house;" "hlne
Duke of Wellington's exploits."
Here Wellington's is not in the possessive, but in the objective after of;
Duke is in the possessive, but the whole is taken as one name, and the possessive termination is placed at the end.
6. When the possessive termination is placed thus, the words are so closely
connected as to form but one name. If any thing more is added, the termination must be placed after it. We may say, " Charles Stuart's death," or,
"The King of England's death," but not "Charles Stuart, the King of England's death."
"This fact appears from Dr. Bacon of Birmingham's experiments."  Here
" of Birmingham" is added to the name of the individual to designate his
place of residence, and the possessive termination should not be placed after
Birmingham.
7. When two or more nouns in the possessive case are connected by and,
the possessive termination should be added to each of them; as, "These are
John's anld lNiza's books."
It would be better to say, " These books belong to John and Eliza."
But, if objects are possessed in common by two or more, and the nouns
are closely connected without any intervening words, the possessive termination is added to the last noun only; as, "These are John and Eliza's books."
It would be better to say, " These books belong in common to John and
Eliza."
8. Mr. Murray says, "But when a pause is proper, and the governing
word not expressed; and the latter part of the sentence is extended; it appears to be requisite that the sign should be applied to the first possessive,
and understood to the other; as,' I reside at Lord Stormont's, my old patron
anld benefactor;' Whose glory did he emulate? He emulated Ctesar's, the
greatest general of antiquity.'"
Such constructions shouid not be used. Instead of the sentences quoted
by Mr. Murray, we may say, " I reside at the house (or mansion, or seat) of
Lord Stormont, my old patron and benefactor;" "Whose glory did he emuWhen two or more nounis are used as the  sive case are connected by and, where

prophet of the Jewish people," we may say, "These psalms were written by
David," etc. Instead of, " I left the paicel at Smith's, the bookseller and
stationer," we may say, "I left the parcel at the residence (or shop) of
Smith, the bookseIler and stationer."
9. Nothing, except some necessary modifying word, should come between
the possessive case and the name of the object possessed. "She began to
extol the farmer's, as she called him, excellenlt understanding," should be,
"She began to extol the excellent understanding of the farmer, as she called
him."
10. A participial noun, either alone or modified by other words, may be
placed after the possessive case; as, "I am opposed to John's writing;" "I
am opposed to his devoting hmself so exclusively to one subject."
This is one of the most common idioms of the language; and no other case
than the possessive should be used in the preceding and similar sentences.
Thus, when we wish to express opposition to the performance of the action,
it is incorrect to say, "I am opposed to John writing."

2. When the subject and object are nouns, the object must usually be
placed after the verb, because the position in the sentence determines the
ease; thus, "Alexander conquered Darius;" not "D)arius conquered Alexander."
But when pronouns are used, the object may be placed before the verb;
as, " Him followed his next mate;" "This subjecthe has examined."
As relatives and interrogatives stand as near as possible to the beginning
of their clauses, they always precede the verb; as, "He whom I serve is
eternal;" " Whom do you serve?'"
8. The object of the verb is omitted, when it is something indefinite or
easily supplied; as, "John reads."
4. Some intransitive verbs are followed by an objective of kindred signification to their own; as, "He runs a race;" "They live a happy life."
Allied to this construction are such expressions as the following: "Death
Vrinned horribly a ghastly smile;" "Her lips blush deeper sweets;"' "Groves,
whose lich trees wept odorous gums and balms;" "From that sapphire fount
the crisped brooks ran nectar."
5. Transitive verbs are sometimes improperly used as intransitive; as, "I
must premise with three circumstances;" "I cannot allow of that." The
preposition should be erased in each one of these sentences.  To locate is
sometimes improperly used as intransitive; as, "H e has located in Cincinnati;" by which is meant that he has become a residenlt of Cincinnati.
6. Intransitive verbs are sometimes improperly used as transitive; " He
repented him of his design."  nim shouldbe erased. It is not elegant to say,
" I He grows corn;" or, "This land grows corn."  We should say, " He raises
or cultivates corn;'" "This land produces copn."
7. Some verbs may be followed by two objectives denoting the same person or thing; as, "Romulus called the city Rome."
The verbs referred to in this remark, are all those verbs that in the passive
voice have a predicate nominative; such as, to choose, to appoint, to elect, to
constitute, to rende', to name, to call, to esteem, to consider, to reckon.
After some of these verbs we may suppose anl ellipsis of the verb to be;
as "' I consider him [to be] a good man."
It is hardly proper to call this apposition. A noun in apposition with another noun, is annexed for the sake of explanation or descrition, and maybe
omitted; but in this construcetionl, the second noun is essential. There is
quite a difference between, "He called Cicero the father of his country;"

and "He called Cicero the father of his country." In the first sentence
" who was"' may be supplied; as, " Ie called Cicero, who was the father of
his country."
8. Some verbs are followed by two objectives, one denoting aperson, and
the other generally denoting a thing; as, " James gave me a book;" " Forgive qus our debts;" " John taught him grammar;" " He granted me afavor;"
" Buy me a book;" " They allowed him a seat;" " It cost him a dollar."
A preposition is understood with the objective of the person, which must
be expressed when this objective comes after the objective of the thing; as,'James gave a book to me;" " They allowed a seat to him."'
9. The objective with which a preposition has been understood has been
mistaken for the object of the verb, and is, from this mistake, often made
the subject of the verb in the passive voice-the other objective being retained after the passive; as, "I was given a book by James;" "He was
allowed a seat." Such expressions should be avoided. With the verb to ask
and to teach, however, this construction is used by good authors; as, " -He
was asked his opPnion;" "H e was taught grammar." It would be better to
say, "His opinion was asked;" "Grammar was taught him;" or, "iHe
learned grammar."

RULE     X.
The o1byct of a preposition        is put in    the obyective
case;   as, "He spoke to me."
Remarks.-1. A preposition may be followed by a participial noun,
either alone or modified by other words; as " He is engaged in w'iting;"
"He accused me of having defrauded him."'
2. The preposition about is sometimes followed by the infinitive mood; as,
"He is about to go."
Other prepositions, especially for, were formerly placed before the infinitive; as, " What went ye out for to see?"
For is sometimes placed before the infinitive with its subject in the objective; as, "This is a dangerous opinion for men to entertain."  Here for
shows the relation between dangerouqs and men to entertain-not men merely.
[See Rlule xi.]
3. Some prepositions are followed by adverbs; as, at once, for ever, ferom

at once is equivalent to at onze time. In some instances a noun mnay be sulpplied; as, "From [places which are] afar."

EXERCISES.
From hence, from thence, etc., are often used, though the preposition is unnecessary.
From is sometimes placed before adjuncts; as, "He came from qunder the
tree."  In such cases a nounl may generally be supplied after from; thus,
"He came from [his position] under the tree."
4. A clause is sometimes made the object of a preposition; as, "Much
will depend on who the comnissioners are."
5. The object of the preposition is sometimes omitted when it is the antecedent to a relative pronloun. See page 51, etc.
6. The preposition is sometimes placed after the objective; as,
"Though bush and fioweret never grow
My dark, unwarming shade below."-Campbell.
In familiar language, it is allowable to place prepositions after relatives and
interrogatives which dclepend on them; as, " Whom did he speak to?" instead of " To whom did he speak?"
7. Home, and nouns denoting time, extent of space, and degree of difference, are put in the objective case without a preposition; as, " He went
home;" "I was there five years;" "He rode forty qiles that day;" "The
pole is tenfeet long;" " This is a great deal better than that."
A preposition may be supplied with some of these; as, "He went [to]
home;" "I was there [during] five years;" "This is [by] a great deal better
than that;" "He rode forty miles [on] that day."  With others it is difficult
to say what preposition may be supplied. Some say, "He rode [through]
forty miles;" "The pole is long [to] ten feet."
8. The objective is used without a preposition after the adjective worth,
and sometimes after lJke, near, and nigh; as, "This hat is worth five dollars;" " He is like [to] his father."
Some consider worth, as used above, a noun, with oqf the unlderstood before
it, and of after it; thus, "This hat is [of the] worth [of] five dollars."  Mr.
Goold Brown and others call it a preposition. But it is used as an adjective
by ancient writers; as, "The more is he worth and worthi."-Piers Ploughmnan. In the following passage from Wiclif it has to connected with it: "If
the salt vanishe away, wherylnne sclal it be salted? I o nothing is it worth

confess   myself to     be in fault;" "Let him           be punished."
Remarks.-1. Him, in the first sentenlce quoted, is not the object of the
verb believe, but the subject of to be. In the second sentence, owrse is not the
object of commanded-it is not meant that a command was given to the
horse.
2. The objective in such case, is equivalent to the nominative with that,
and the infinitive to a finite verb; thus, "I believe that he is an honest man;"
"He commanlded that the horse should be saddled."
3. When the infinitive with its subject is the suLbject of another verb, it
is introduced byfor; as, "For you to go is better;" "It is better for you

"It is better for you to go," may also mean, " To go is better for you."

2. The infinitive is sometimes used, generally after so as or too, to denote a
result; as, " The difficulties were so great as to deter him;" "He is too
proud to labor."
The infinitive is often used elliptically after than; as, "Nothing makes a
man suspect much, more than to know little [does]."
8. The infinitive is sometimes used to denote a pusrpose; as, "Those who
came to scof remained to pray."  In this sense it is often preceded by in
order; thus, "Those who came in order to scoff, remained in order to pray."
The preposition/for was formerly used before the infinitive denoting a purpose; as, " What went ye oLut/or to see?"
4. The infinitive, especially in the passive voice, is often used to denote
obligation or necessity; as, "This is a thing to be desired."  The verb to be is
sometimes expressed in sulch cases; as, " This is a thing which is to be desired."
5. The infinitive is sometimes used absolutely; as, "To confess the truth,

6. The inlfinitive is often construed like a noun, and may be the subject of
a verb, or the object, or stand as the predicate nominative, or be placed in
apposition with a noun; as, " To play is pleasant;" "Boys love to play;"
"To study is not to play."
7. After the active voice of the verbs bid, dare, feel, hear, let, make, need,
see, and some others, the infinitive is used without to; as, " He bids me
come;' " I saw him write;" "We heard him tell the story."
To is generally expressed after the passive voice of these verbs; as, "He
was seen to write."
The verbs after may, can, must, etc., are infinitives with to omitted.
8. The infinitive is sometimes omitted; as, "I believed him [to be]
honest." So to be in tlo l:xssive infinitive is sometimes omitted; as, "I supposed him [to be] cured;" "He heard the letter [to be] read."
9. The perfect infinitive is sometimes improperly usedcl for the imperfect

represents anl action as past at the time referred to; but this infinitive is
used to express an action, which, though past at the time of speaking, was
not so at the time to which the finite verb refers. This sentence should be,
"Yesterday I hoped to see you."'

RULE XIII.
Participles are modified in the same way as their
verbs are.
Thus, if the verb is followed by the objective case, so is the
participle; as, "He sees me," " Seeing me," "Having seen
me."
If the verb has two objectives, the participle has also; as,
"Hie calls him John," "Calling him John," "H aving called
him John."
If the verb takes a predicate nominative, so does the participle; as, "He is a judge," "Being a judge," "Having been a
judge."
The same adjuncts that modify the verb, modify the participle; as, " He speaks of me," "Speaking of me," "H Having spoken
of me."
How are participles modified?
176PARTICIPLES.
177
Note.-The participle is modified like the verb in the sasne voice.
Remarks.-1. The participial noun, like the infinitive, has the properties both of a noun and a verb; both it and the infinitive are modified just
as participles are. See Rule vi. Remark 5.
2. The participial noun may be used either in the nominative or the objective,
but not in the possessive case. It may be the subject of a verb, or the
object of a verb, or of a preposition, and at the same time have its own
object; thus, " Its excesses may be restrained without destroying its inlfluence;" "IIe studied to avoid expressing himself too severely."  In the first
sentence destroying is a participial noun in the objective after the prepositioni
without, and influence is in the objective after destroying; in the second,
expressing is the object of the verb to avoid, and himse'lf is thle object of ezPressing.
3. When a 1noun is limited by an adjective, though it may have the form
of a participle, it is simply a noun, and should be construed as such.
Thus, " By the observing of these rules;" " This is a complete forsaking of
truth;" " For the mnore easy reading of large numbers."
Errors are sometimes committed by leaving out oqf after such nouns; as,
" By the observing these rules."  Both the adjective and of may be omitted,
however, and then the word becomes a participial noun; as, " By observing
these rules."
The participial noun should noe be followed by of; as, " By observing of
these rules." If the verb from whiah it is derived is followed by of, the
participial noun is also; as, "I He spoke of those rules," " By speaking of
those rules."
4. When the participle is changed into a noun, it cannot be modified by
adverbs, as the participial noun may be; thus, it is incorrect to say, " For
the more easily reading of large numbers." but " For reading large numbers more easily" is correct.
5. The participial noun is often connected with the possessive case; as,
"I have some recollection of his father's being a judge."
Mr. Goold Brown and others suppose judge to b in the possessive case in
apposition with father's; Dr. Butllions says that it is in the objective. It is
simply the predicate nominative. See Rule vi. Remark 5.
Mr. Brown has not shown his usual acuteness in treatihxg of the participle.

trantire, and the participles relate to the nominatives going before, as in
the text quoted in the preceding observation."*  "The analogy of general
grammar," says Mr. B., " evidently requires in such cases the infinitive or a
nounl."
The truth is, that the participle in such cases is a verbal noun, and allied
to the infinitive; in the German and Greek, for instance, the infinitive is
generally used, when in English the participial noun is employed.t In the
first of the following sentences, expressing is a simple participle-an adjective; in the second it is a noun; " He reproved John, expressing himself
very severely;" " He studied to avoid expressing himself too severely." But
Mr. Brown seems to think that expressing is always an adjective.
7. When the auxiliary perfect participle, (or the passive, which is the same
in form), and the past tense of the verb differ in form, one is often incorrectly used for the other; thus, "I donze" is often used for "I did," "I
seen" for "I saw," " I have went" for " I have gone," "I have wrote" for " I
have written." Sulch errors should be carefully avoided. See List of Irregular Verbs, Second Class, p. 100.

RULE     XIV.
A  preposition shows the relation between a noun or
pronoun and some other word.
See Etymology of Prepositions, and Rule x.
Note.-The other word usually precedes.
Remarks.-1. The noun or pronoutn is sometimes omitted; as, "He is a
man [whom] I should like to become acquainted with;" "He gave assistance to [him] whoever had need of it."
2. The preceding word is sometimes omitted; as, "[To speak] in a word,
he is ruined."
3. Two prepositions are sometimes placed before the same noun or pronoun; as, " He camefrom, and is now returning to, France." This is inelegant; it should be, "He came firom France, and is now returning to it."
Such expressions are allowable in forms of law.

"There is no need for [of] his assistance."
"Her sobriety is no derogation to [firom] her understanding."
"He died for [of] thirst."
"This is very different to [from] that."
"He is reconciled with [to] the king.'"
"They have a great resemblance with [to] each other."
"That was agreeable with [to] his principles."
"Virtue and vice differ widely with [from] each other."
"You may safely confide on [in] him."
"He does not profit from [by] experience."
"You may rely in [on] what I tell you."
"This tale is founded in [on] facts."
"They have quarreled among [with] each other."
"They must be followed with [by] appropriate prepositions."
5. A taste of a thing implies actual enjoyment; a taste for it implies capacity for enjoyment.
We are disappointed of a thing, when we cannot get it; and we are disappointed in it, when we have it, and find it does not answer our expectations.
In is used before the names of countries; cities, and large towns; and at
before the names of villages, single houses, and cities which are in distant
countries; thus, "He lives in France, or in Philadelphia;" " He lives at
Houghton;" "He resides at Rome."
In is often improperly used for into, to denote entranlce, etc.; as, "He
went in (into) the house."
Between or betwixt has reference to two objects or classes of objects;
when the reference is to more.than two, among or amidst must be used; as,
"He divided it between John and James;" "He divided it among John,
James, and William."

RULE    XV.
Adverbs modfy' verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
[See Etymology of Adverbs.]
Remarks.-1. A.dverbs should be placed as near to the words which
they modify, as they can be without producing harshness.
Note.-The same remark applies to adjuncts. Any more definite rule
would be liable to so many exceptions as to be nlearly useless.

adverbs and adjuncts?
181
What is the rule for adverbs?182
EXERCISES.
Such adverbs as only, rneraly, chiefly,* are frequently misplaced; thus, "I
only saw John, and not James;" "I saw John only, but did not speak to
him." The first sentence should be, "I saw only John," or, "I saw John
only;" the second should be, "I only saw John."
2. In familiar language, here, there and where are used for hither, thither
and whither.
3. Two negatives should not be used to express a negation, because they
destroy each other, or are equivalent to an affirmative; thus, " Nobr did they
not deserve the condemnation," means that they did deserve it.
4. Adjectives should not be used as adverbs, nor adverbs as adjectives;
"He writes beautiful," should be, "He writes beautifully;" " The above
lines," should be, " Thepreceding lines;" "Thine ofjten infirmities," should
be, "Thyfrequent infirmities."

Conjunetions connect words and ]ropositions.
Remarks.-1. The conjunction is sometimes omitted; as, "They confess
the power, (and) wisdom, and love of their Creator;" "I believe (that) he is
a good man."
2. Some conjunctions are used before the first of two, and sometimes more,
connected words or clauses, to mark the connection more forcibly; as,
" Both John and James were there." Here and connects John and James,

4. After than the objective case of the relative pronoun is used, even when
any other word would be in the nominative; as, " Satan, than whom, Beelzebub excepted, none higher sat."-M- ilton. This is an anomaly, which some
grammarians explain by supposing that than was formerly used as a preposition.
5. As frequently joins to a word another denoting character or offce, etc.;
as, "They employed him as a clerk;" "He was employed as a clerk."
After the infinitive, or a participial noun, as may be placed before a noun
without connecting it to any preceding noun; as, "He wished to be employed as a clerk."
Such constructions may perhaps be considered, at least in their origin,
elliptical; thus, "They employed him as a clerk (is employed.)"  As, thus
used, would be an adverb.
6. Two parts of different propositions may be conn6eted, when the remain,
ing part of the one is the same as that of the other; as, "This always has
been, and always will be, admired."
But if the remaining part of one is not the same as that of the other, the
two parts should not be connected. Thus, it is incorrect to say, "This
always has, and always will, be admired," because, if be admired is added to
the first part, it will be, has be admired.
"He was more beloved, but not so much admired as Cynthio."    This is
inaccurate, because we cannot say, " He was more beloved as Cynthio." It
should be, "He was more beloved than Cynthio, but not so much admired"
-as Cynthio being understood.'7. After the comparative degree, and after other. and else, which partake ol
the nature of the comparative, than is used to introduce the latter teim of
comparison; as, "He is greater than I;" "It is no other than he;" "What
else do you expect than this?"
8. After expressions denoting doubt,fear, and denial, but, but that, or lest is
often improperly used instead of that; as, "I do not doubt butt that he is
honest;" "I am afraid lest he may not return."
9. After conjunctions denoting doubt or contingency, shall and should ought
not to be omitted, unless futurity is implied. " Though man be a sinner, yet
God is merciful to him," should be, "Though man is a sinner," etc.
10. Mr. Brown's thirteenth rule is, "When verbs are connected by a conjunction, they must either agree in mood, tense, and form, or have separate

Interjections have no grammntatical connection with
other words.
Remarks.-1. Ah is sometimes placed before the objective case of the
pronoun of the first person; as, " Ah me!I" This seems to be, as it were,
an objective independent. The same construction is used without the interjection; as, " Me miserable! which way shall I fly!"
Some explain this construction by supposing an ellipsis; "Ah! [pity]
me."
2. Ellipses frequently occur after interjections; as, " O! that I had the
wings of a dove!" " 0 for a closer walk with God!" " Oh! a chair." In
the first two quotations, I wish may be inserted after the interjections; in

186PROSODY.
PROSODY treats of the laws of versification.
A verse is a certain number of accented and unaccented syllables, arranged in regular order, and constituting a line of
poetry.
A foot is a portion of a verse, consisting of two or more
syllables combined according to accent.
- A straight line () over a syllable shows that it is accented,
and a curved line (-) that it is unaccented.
Remark.-In the poetry of some languages, syllables are long and short,
instead of accented and unaccented. A long syllable occupies twice the
time of a short one.
The principal feet are
The Iambus,   -                   The Arnapest,      -
The Trochee, -                   The Dactyl,The Spondee, - -                  The Amphibrach,   -
The Pyrrhic,                      The Tribrach,  
The iambus has the second syllable accented, and the first unaccented; as,
devote, create.
The trochee has thefirst syllable accented, and the second unaccented; as,
nobl, hamlet.
The anapest has the last syllable accented, and the first two unaccented;
as, acquiesce, mlsbehave.
The dactyl has thefirst syllable accented, and the last two unaccented; as,
laborer, positive.
The spondee consists of two accented syllables; as, the pale moon.
The pyrrhic consists of two unaccented syllables; as, on the tall tree.

unaccented; as, d6rmestfc.
The tribrach consists of three unaccented syllables; as, numerable.
The pyrrhic, spondee, and tribrach occur occasionally. The amphibrach
is the iambus with an additional short syllable.

If a verse is composed principally of iambuses, it is called
iambic verse; if of trochees, trochaic; if of anapests, anapestic;
if of dactyls, dactylic.
Rhyme is a similarity of sound between the last syllables of
different verses.
Blank verse is without rhyme.
Scanning is the dividing of a verse into the feet of which it

A verse which is complete is called acatalectic; one which is
deficient is called catalectic; one which has a redundant syllable is called hypercatalectic, or hypermeter.

A verse of six feet is called an Alexandrine.
An Elegiac stanza consists of four heroic verses rhyming alternately; as,

And right and wrong alike in equal balance weighed.
This stanza is named from the poet Spenser. It is the measure in which
his "Faerie Queene" is written.
Iambic verse of seven feet is usually divided into two lines;
the first containing four feet, the second three; as,
When all thy mercies, 0 my God,
My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view I'm lost
In wonder, love, and praise.
This is what is called common meter.
Long meter has four iambuses in a verse.

stress on the first syllable, we may scan it as a trochee with an
additional long syllable.
Anl additional short syllable may be added to each of these
forms.  But when a short syllable is added to the first form,
we usually give more stress to the first syllable, and make two
trochees.

A dactylic verse scarcely ever ends with a dactyl. Sometimes
one long syllable is added, sometimes a trochee. Thus:
Brightest and I best 6f th6 I sons 6f thi I mornIng,
Dawn O6n 6ur darkness, and I lend us thine  aid.
Scarcely any poem     is perfectly regular in its feet.     Iambc
verse, for instance, admits of either of the other feet. Thus:
Prophet of plagues, forever boding ill.
M1armaring, and with him fled the shades of night.
Before all temples th6 apright heart and pure.
Brought death into the world and all our woes.
And thunders down impetaous tO the plain.
In iambic verse, the initial short syllable is often omitted, and the verse
becomes trochaic, with an additionlal long syllable.
In trochaic verse, if the initial long syllable is omitted, the line- becomes
iambic, with an additional short syllable.
In anapestic verse, if the two initial short syllables are omitted, the verse
becomes dactylic, with a long syllable added.
In dactylic verse, if the initial long syllable is omitted, the verse becomes
anapestic.
By intermingling iambuses and anapests a pleasing movement is produced.     This is often done by modern poets.      Thus:
I come, I Ycome! I ye have called I me lo1ng,
I come I o'6r th6 mOun I talns with lIght I and sOng I

ETYMOLOGY.
ETYMOLOGY treats     of the   classification of words,
and their modifications.
Words are divided into eight classes, called Parts
of Speech.
These parts of speech are called Noun, Adjective,
Pronoun, Verb, Preposition, Adverb, Con,unotion, and
Interjection.
Note.-The article belongs to the class of adjectives.
NOUN.
A noun is the name of an object; as, John, horse,
whiteness.
Remark.-An object may have either a real existence, or merely an existence attributed to it by the mind. Thus, horse is the name of an object
which has a real existence; but whiteness is the name of a quality which has
no real existence independent of the object to which it belongs, and is merely
considered by the mind as having an existence by itself.
The mind may consider even non-entity, or the absence of a thing, as a positive idea; as, non-existenee, nought, nullity, nothiing.

POETIC PAUSES.
There should be a pause at the close of every verse, even
where no pause is required by the sense. This is called the
final pause.
The sentential pause, or pause for sense, requires a change of
tone; but, in the final pause, the voice should be merely suspended, without being either raised or depressed.
In many instances, the ear can distinguish verse from prose only by means
of the final pause. Blank verse, if the final pause is omrnitted, and there is no
sentenltial pause at the end of the line, sounds as if it were only poetical
prose. This will be made evident by alranging a few verses as they would
be read without this pause.
"His spear, to equal which the tallest pine hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast of some great admiral, were but a
wand, he walked with, to support uneasy steps over the burning marie-not like those steps on heaven's azure; and the
torrid clime smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire."
Tell where the final pause should be in the preceding.    It is
heroic verse.
The cesural pause divides the line into two equal or unequal
parts, and is made naturally by the voice in reading verse correctly.
The shorter kinds of verse are without this pause.
The natural place for it is near the middle of the line; the
sense of the passage, however, often requires it to be removed
fiom its natural position. If it always recurred at the same
place, the verse would be too monotonous.
In the following heroic verses, the cesural pause is in the
mniddle of the third foot, that is, in the middle of the line:
The steer and lion" at one crib shall meet,
And harmless serpents" lick the pilgrim's feet.

What is the cesural pause?
198POETIC PAUSES.
199
In the following line the pause is at the end of the third foot,
because it cannot take place in thle middle of a word:
The crested basilisk" and speckled snlake.
In the following, it takes place in the middle of the fourth
foot, because all the preceding words are so intimately connected
that a pause would mar the sense:
And onl the sightless eyeball" pour the day.
It may fall even in the middle of the first foot, or of the last,
but then there is usually a second pause.
But not to me returns
Day" or the sweet approach of even or morn.
No sooner had the Almighty ceased," but all
The multitude of angels" with a shout
Loud" as from numbers without number," sweet
As from blest voices" uttering joy.
Besides the cesural pause there are often demicesuras, or half
pauses.   Thus:
Warms' in the sun," refreshes' in the breeze,
Glows' in the stars," anld blossoms' in the trees;
Lives' through all life," extends' through all extent,
Spreads' undivided," operates' unspent.
Show the place of the cesural pause in the following:
Rapt into future times, the bard begun!
A virgin shall conceive, a virgin bear a son I
From Jesse's root behold a branch arise,
Whose sacred flower with fragrance fills the skies;
The ethereal spirit o'er its leaves shall move,
And on its top descend the mystic dove.

Thus wondrous fair; thyself how wondrous then!

PUNCTUATION.
PUNCTUATION treats of the points and mlarks
which are used in writing.
These marks are used chiefly to denote pauses.
The following are the principal marks used in writing:
The Comma [,], the Semicolon [;), the ColonI [:], the
Period[.], the Note of Interrogation (?], the Note of Exclamation [! ], the Dash [--1, and the Parenthesis [()].
The comma marks the shortest pause; the semicolon, a
pause double that of the comma; the colon, a pause double
that of the semicolon; and the period, the longest pause.
Note.-The duration of the pauses must be left to the taste of the reader.
C 0 OM M A.
The general rule is, that a comma is used in those parts of a
sentence in which a short pause is required.

But when the logical subject is rendered long by the additionl of adjuncts to the grammatical subject, a comma may be
placed aftel' the logical subject; as, "The necessity of an early
acquaintance with history, has always been acknowledged;"
"To be totally indifferent to praise or censure, is a real defect
in character."
EXERCISES.
Are the followving sentences correctly punctuated?
All finery, is a sign of littleness. Idleness is the great fomenter of all corruptions in the human heart.  The tear of repentance, brings its own relief. To be, contents his natural
desire. The fear of the Lord, is the beginning of wisdom.
A steady and undivided attention to one pursuit will give
success. The punishment of the reckless disturbers of society
tends to secure peace.
RULE    II.
The clauses of a compound sentence are generally  separated    by   a  comma;     as, "Phocion was
poor, though he might have been rich;"''          Phocion,
though he might have been rich, was poor;"' This
principle, which had beenl instilled into his mind
from  his youth, influenced all his conduct;"          This
work, said he, is amusing."
But when the members are closely connected, the comma is
not used; as, "Revelation teaches us how we may attain happiness;" "Principles which are instilled into the mind in youth,
have the greatest influence."
In the first example, the dependent clause is the object of the verb teaches,
and is, of course,. closely connected; in the second, the relative clause modifies the noun principles, and forms with that nlounll the logical subject.

R U L E I II.
Two words of the same class--whether nouns,
adjectives, verbs, or adverbs--connected by a conjunction, do not admit of a comma between them;
as,'"Reason and virtue answer one great aim;"
"He   is a plain and honest man;" "' Religion expands   and elevates the mind;" " We must live
virtuously or viciously."
But if the connected words have adjuncts, the comma may be
inserted; as, "Intemperance destroys the vigor of our bodies,
and the strength of our minds."
When a pause between two words will give distinctness or
emphasis, the comma is inserted; as, "'Tis certain he could
write, and cipher too;" "A good man will love himself too
well to lose, and his neighbor too well to win, an estate by
gaiiing."
When tihe conjunction is understood, the comma is used; as,
"Reason, virtue answer one great aim;" "He is a plain, honest
man."

woman.
RULE    IV.
When three or more words of the same class are
connected by conjunctions expressed or understood,
the comma is used after every one but the last; as,
"He was a brave, wise, and pious man."
If several nouns are connected to form a compound subject,
the comma is inserted after every one; as, "Poetry, music, and
painting, are fine arts."
When words are used together in pairs, they should be separated in pairs by the comma; as, "Truth is fair and artless,
simple and sincere, uniform and consistent;" "We should be
moderate, whether we eat or drink, labor or sleep."
EXERCISES.
Insert the comma where it is required in the following sentences.
Success generally depends on acting prudently steadily and
vigorously. He ruined himself by self-conceit presumption and
obstinacy. He is a noble high-minded generous man. The

1. When a proposition is complete in itself, but followed by
some atklitional remark or illustration; as," Study to acquire a
habit of thinking: no study is more importanit."
Remark.-If the latter proposition were connected to the former by a
conjunction, the colon could not be properly used; as, " Study to acquire a
habit of thinking; for no study is more important."
2. NVhen several semiicolons have been employed, and a still
greater pause is necessary before the full stop; as, "We perceive the shladow to have moved along the dial, but did not see
it moving; and it appears that the giass has grown, though
nobody ever saw it grow. so the advances we make in knowledge, as they consist of insensible steps, are perceivable only by

towards all men."
The period is also used after abbreviations; as,

Remark.-It must not be supposed that the sentence following the
period never has any connection with that which precedes it. It is sometimes used even before a conjunction; as, "Recreations, though they may
be of an innocent kind, require steady government, to keep them withinl a
due and limited province. But such as are of anirregular and vicious nature,
are not to be governed, but to be banished from every well regulated mind."

for thy loving-kindniess is great!"
Note.-The note of interrogation is sometimes improperly used after exclamations which have the form of questions; as, "How great is the mnercy

PAR E N T'H ES I S.
The parenthesis includes a clause not essential
to the sentence; as,
"Know then this truth, (enough for man to know,)
Virtue alone is happiness below."
Remarks.-1. The parenthetical clause should have the same point that
is used before it; thus, there is a comma after know, because there is one
after truth.
But cases of interrogation and exclamation are excepted: as, " While they
wish to please, (and why should they not wish it?) they disdain dishonorable means."
2. The parenthesis is now seldom used; instead of it, sometimes the comma, and sometimes the dash is employed; as,

CLASSES OF NOUNS.
CLASSES       OF   NOUNS.
Nouns are divided into two classes; proper and
common.
A proper noun is the name of an individual object;   as, John, Vesuvius.
A common noun is a name applied to all objects
belonging to the same class; as, boy, mountain.
Note.- Vesuviuts is the name of an indiviclual mountain; but mnountain is
a name belonging to each one of a whole class of objects. These objects are
classed together, and have the same name on account of having certain properties in common.
Remarks.-1. The same proper name is oftenl applied to each of several
individuals, but not because they have certain properties in common, and
form a class. Thus, several persons are calledl John, but these individuals
do not form a class.
2. Proper names are sometimes used to designate a class, and then become
common noulns; as, "The twelve Cesars."    Here twelve individuals are
classed together, because they have the samne name, at least, in common.
3. Proper names sometimes become commau, whenl the names of distinguished individuals are applied to others possessing similar qualities. Thus
we say of a great and good general, " He is a Washington," or, " The Washington of his country."
4. Proper nouns always begin with capital letters.
A common noun which designates two or more
objects, considered      as   one   collection, or    body, is
called a collective noun; as, pair, flock, army,          multitude.
Note.-The word army denlotes a great many individuals, but they are
considered as forming a single body.
EXERCISES.
1. Name the proper and common nouns in the exercises on page 15: also in the

1. The first word of every distinct sentence.
2. Proper names, and titles of office or honor; as, George
Washington, General Lee, Lord Broutgham, Judge Story,
Sir Walter Scott, the Ozhio, Main Street.
Remark.-The name of an object personified iLay be used as a proper
name, and should then begin with a capital; as, " Come, gentle Spring."
3. Adjectives derived from proper namues; as, American,
F1Kylish, Roman.
4. The appellations of the Deity; as, God, the Almighty, the
Supreme Being, the Most High.
5. The first word of every line of poetry.
6. The first word of a direct quotation, when the quotation
woutld form  a comiplete sentence by itself; as, "Christ says,'My yoke is easy.'"
7. Every nouni aul principal word in the titles of books; as,
"Pope's Essay on Man."
8. The pronoun I, and the interjection 0, are written in
capitals.

NUMBER.
Remarks.-1. These nouns are called abstract, because they are the names
of qualities, etc., abstracted; that is, considered apart from the objects to
which they belonLg. Thus, honesty does not really exist without being connected with some individual, but the mind abstracts it from nll individuals,
and considers it as an object existing by itself: as " HZonesty is the best policy." So destruction is considered apart firom any destroyer.
2. These are usually classed among common nouns, though not very properly. An abstract n oun does not cldenlote a class of objects. The word honesty,
for example, denotes a quality which is found in many individcluals, but it is
always the same quality; bdt the word boy, when applied to Thomas, does
not mean the same individual that it does when applied to John. Abstract
nlouns, when used as such, have no plural, and do lnot admit of a, or an, ol
one, before them, as every noun dcloes which denotes a class. In these respects
abstract resemble proper nlouns.
3. The same word may be either an abstract or a common noun, according
to the mneaning attached to it. Thus, when we say, " Virtue is lovely," we
use the word virtue as the name of a single quality; and it is an abstract
noun; but when we speak of the virtues of charity, of justice, of temperance,
etc., the word is applied to a class, aud is a common n1oun.
Substantial nouns are such as denote the sutbstance   of which     objects    are  composed.        Such    are
the  names     of metals, grain,        etc.;    as, iron, gold,
wheat, snow, fire.
Remarks.-1. These, as well as abstract nouns, are usually classed with
common nouns. But they do not, strictly speaking, denote classes of objects.
Like abstract nouins, they have no plural, and do not admit a, or an, or one,
before them.
2. Substantial, as well as abstract nouns, may become common nouns by
varying the sense. Thus, when we say, " Snow is white," we use snow as a
substantial noun; but whlen we say, " A snow fell last night," we mean a
body of snow, and use the word as a common noun. The words cottons,
grasses, etc., are often used instead of kinds of grass, etc.; these words are in
such cases used as common nouns.
To nouns belong number, gender, case, and person

Number is a modification of nouns to denote
whether one object is meant, or more than one.

From the charmed waters, which still brighter grew

Let us read with method, and propose to ourselves an end to which all our
studies may point. Through neglect of this rule, gross ignorance often disgraces great readers; who, by skipping hastily andcl irregularly from onlle subject to another, render themselves incapable of combininlg their ideas. So
many detached parcels of knlowledge cannot form a whole. This inconstancy

even robs it of the advantages of natural good sense. Yet let us avoid the

The regular mode of forming the plural is by
adding s to the singular; as, book, books; page,
pages.
When the singular ends with a sound which cannot unite
with s, then es is added; as, church, churches; box, boxes;
kiss, kisses; brush, brushes.
Nouns ending in o preceded by a consonant add es; as,
negro, negroes; wo, woes; hero, heroes.
xception.-livTwo has twos, because o.has the sound of oo. Most persons
write cantos, juntos, etc. It would be better to have uniformity.
Other nouns in o add s only; as, folio, folios.
Nouns ending in y preceded by a consonant change y into ie,
and add s; as, lady, ladies; fly, flies.
Other nouns in y do not change the y; as, day, days; valley,
valleys.
Proper nouns do not change the y when they are used in the
plural; as, the Henrys.

4,A MANUAL
OF THE
ART OF PROSE COMPOSITION,
By JOHN M. BONNELL, D. D.
In the preparation of this work, it has been no part of the compiler's
aim to be original. He has sought rather to select from the variouw
treatises on this subject those rules and exercises which have been approved by the experience of teachers, and to combine them into one
consistent whole, arranged with reference to the progressive development of the learner's powers.-E xtractfrom the Preface.
The author disclaims originality, and yet is more original than nine tenths of less
modest writers. The volume bears evident marks of being the work of a practical and
experienced teacher. As a whole it comes nearer to our idea of what a manual on this
subject should be for the ordinary classes of students in our Academies and High
Schools than any other that we have seen.-American Educational Monthly, New
York, March, 1868.
The result of practical thought in the class-room, it is precisely such a series of illus.
trations and views of the subject as most teachers have found it necessary to prepare
for themselves.-The Pound Table, New York, March, 1868.
It is a capital work in plan and execution, and worthy of introduction into our best
institutions of learning.-NV. Lawrence Lindsley, Lebanon, Tenn.
It is just the book that is needed in our schools. It is admirable for its conciseness,
its comprehensiveness, the accuracy of its definitions, and the appropriateness of its
examples.-W. Shelton, President West Tennessee College.
I consider it an admilrable compilation. The arrangement of the whole work is philosophical, and the chapters on Invention and Expression are very complete.-Charles
Taylor, President Kentucky Wesleyan University.
A treatise well calellated to serve as a text-book in schools and colleges, and at the
same time just such a guide as very many of our young professional and business men
greatly need.-J. Berrien Lindsley, Chancellor University of Nashville.
I am very well pleased with it. The plan is excellent, and I think ths execution well
sustained.-John N. Waddell, LL. D., Chancellor University of Mississippi.
Atext-book of rare merit.-R. D. Mallory, UZnion Female Academy, Eufaula, Ala.
I have long wanted just such a help in the school-room.-A. L. Hanmilton, Pres't
Andrew Female College, Cuthbert, Ga.
We consider it sutperior to any other work of the kind which has ever come under our
notice.-Georgie A. Hulse McLeod, Southern Literary Institute, Baltimore.
It is decidedly the most complete and exhaustive treatise that I have seen.- W. H.
Stuart, Columbia, KIy.

WEBSTER'S ELEMENTARY SPELLING-BOOK:
OR A
SPELLER AND DEFINER;
CONTAINING A SELECTION OF 12,000 OF THE MOST USEFUL WORDS
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, WITH THEIR DEFINITIONS.
BY WILLIAM G. WEBSTER.
That children should be taught, not only how to read, but the
meaning of the words which they read, is self-evident; and it is
equally so, that theirearly lessons in definitions should conisistof the
more simple words, or such at least as are best suited to their necessities
and to their progress in knowledge.
The object of this Speller and Definer is to present to teachers a
selection of the most common and useful words of the language, properly defined, that young scholars by the use of it may more readily
comprehend the meaninig of the words in the books which they study
or read, and the conversation which they daily hear, leaving the more
difficult words to maturer years and maturer powers of comprehension.
This collection embraces but about twelve thousand words, and these
are, with few exceptions, of a practical and useful chlaracter; while
ordinary school dictionaries usually contain about t/lirty thousandl
To require pupils to conmmit to memory and recite the meaning of this
great numnber of words, is to impose a heavy task without conferring
an equivalent benefit. Besides, many of these words being rare, and
not a few above the comprehension of children, the simple, the common, and the frequently-used only are likely to be retained in their
memories.
It is the opinion of many intelligent teachers, who have examined
the plan of this book, that it needs but to be known to be universally
adopted in our schools.

The subjects are all treated with marked ability.-National Quarterly Review.
A most excellent Southern college text-book. May the number of such increase.DeBow's Review.

produce such a work as Dr. BARBEE has prepared.-NEashville Medical Joutrnal.
In treating the Moral Bearings of the science the author presents ten strosig arguments for the antiquity of the globe-shows there is 1io conflict between Scripture and
Geology, and directs attention to the proofs of Divine goodness and wisdom.-Princeton Review.
One of the most logical works on Geology we ever perused.-N. Y. Churchman.

The above Series of Readers, by NOBLE BUTLER, have attained a
very large circulation in the South and West. They are elegantly

art of reading by the word method, the phonetic method, or the common method.
2. In the graduation of lessons from the beginning of the first book to the end of the
last.
3. In the appropriate and inst-uctive character of the illustrations.
4. In the systematic and thorough course of practice in enunciation found in the
books.
5. In the completeness and practical character of the rhetorical exercises.
6. In the sprightliness and vitality of the lessons.
7. In the predominance of the dramatic element in the lessons. This is a most important feature.
8. In the careful adaptation of the length of sentences and paragraphs to the
requirements of the class-room.
9. In the tasteful simplicity of the first four Readers.
10. In the variety, interest, and spirit of the  Er  READER.

some special and attractive feature. Not a dull lesson can be found in the books.
13. In the fact that every lesson has special reference to the intellectual development
of the learner.
14. In the fact that nearly every lesson, before insertIon, was subjected to the test of
actual use in the school-room.
15. In the fact that there does not exist any-where else in the English language a collection of reading exercises so well adapted to develop a love for what is true, beautiful,
and good, and an aversion to the immoral and ruinous literature of the day.
16. In the carefully prepared and accurate definitions of the FouRTH and Fr
READERs.
17. In the elaborate, comprehensive, and thorough CAUTIONS for the avoidance of
besetting errors of pronunciation.
18. In the copious, critical, biographical, and explanatory notes of the SE"T  READER.
19. In the fact that the SrxE READER has not its equal, whether we regard quantity,
quality, or variety of reading matter, in any similar collection extant. It contains the
best productions of the best writers in the English language.
20. In the fact that, when all the elements bearing upon a comparison are considered,
they are the CHEAPEST BOOKS published in the United States.

PUBLISHERS.Gallows is used by some as both singular and plural; others
make the plural gallowses.  See Webster's Dictionary.
Fish has a regular plural; as, "Two small fishes;" but fish
is often usecl as plural; as, "We are to blame for eatinlg these
fish."  Trout, salmon, etc., are both singular and plural.
Such names of sciences as mathematics, ethics, optics, acoustics, metaphysics, politics, pneumatics, hydrostatics, are properly
plural, though they are sometimes construed as singutlar.  Good
writers, to avoid a harsh construction, often join the word
science to these terms; as, "The science of politics contains
two parts," instead of "Politics contains two parts."
Horse and foot, when they denote bodies of soldiers, are
plural; as, "The army consisted of five hundred horse and five
thousand foot."
Sail, when it denotes a collectionl of ships, is plural; as,
"The fleet consisted of forty sail."
Cannon and shot are sometimnes used as plural.
Yoke is sometimes plural; as, "Five hundred yoke of oxen."
-Bible.
Most compounds form their plural regularly, by adding s to
the singular; as, handful, handfuls; maid-servant, maid-servants; outpouring, outpourings.
But sometimes the noun of the compound, when it comes
first, is treated as if not coalescing with the other parts, and the
s is added to the simple noun, and not to the end of the compound word; as, father-in-law, fathers-in-law; court-martial,
courts-martial; knight. errant, knights-errant.
Mlan-servant changes both the simple words; as, men-servants. So, women-servants. See Gen. xx. 14.
Proper names take the plural form when two or more persons of the same name are classed together; as, "The Mortons."
So, when a title (Miss, Mr., etc.) is prefixed; as, "The Miss
Mortons;"  " The Mr. Andersons;" " Thle Miss Broughtons
What is said of qallows?-of fish?-of ITow do compounds formn the plural?

Miss Browns."-.Maria Edgeworth. The title in such cases
may be considered as an adjective; thus, the word Miss comprehends the ideas expressed by the adjectives unmarried and
female; or, the title and the name may be considered as forming a compound name.
If the persons are spokeni of individually, the title takes the
plural form; as, "Misses Julia and Maria Morton;" S"Messrs.*
George and Thomas Anderson."

ixes, beaus,  cherubs, criterions, encomiums, memorandums,
seraphs.  Some writers give the plural in s to other words in
this list; as, calxes, apparatuses, mediums,focuses, stamens.
Genius has genii when aerial spirits are meant; but when
persons of genius are meant, geniuses.
Index has indices when referring to algebraic quantities; but
indexes when it signifies pointers, or tables of contents.
Animalcule has animalcules, or animalculce.
To denote the plural of mere characters, s preceded by an
apostrophe (') is added; as, two a's; three 5's.
Some words derived from    foreign languages have no singular; as, antipodes, credenda, literati, minutice.  So, vertebrata,
infusoria, and some other scientific terms.
Abstract and substantial nouns, from the nature of their signification, have no plural.  There are no such words as whitenesses, hastes, golds, honesties.
But where nouins which are usually abstract or substantial
are used as common, they may have the plural form.
Such nouns as scissors, lungs, tongs, have no singular, because
they denote objects which consist of two parts.
Some nouns in the singular number have a plural form;
such are molasses, measles, etc.   Oats, according to analogy,
would be in the singular, since it is a substantial noun, like
wheat, rye, etc.; but it is usually construed as plural.

GENDER.
Gender is a modification of nouns to denote the
distinction of sex.
There are four genders-the masculine, the fenmmnine, the common, and the neuter.
Nouns which denote mnales are of the masouline
gender; as, man, boy, lion.
Nouns which denote females are of the feminine
gender; as, woman, girl, lioness.
Nouns which are applied to living beings withoutf
reference  to sex are of the     common    gender; as,
parent, cousin, sheep.
What is gender?           r What nouns are of the masculine gender?
How many genders?            --of the feminine?-of the common?
24Nouns which denote things without sex are of the
neuter gender; as, tree, paper, bookc.
Note.-The word neuter means neither. There is a male sex, and afema
sex, but no nuter sex; neuter gender is merely a grammatical termn applied to
the names ot objects which have no distinction of sex. So thle term common
gender is a gramitatical term applied merely to the words, and does not imply
any con imon sez
Rem arks.--1. As none but living beings have the distinction of sex, the
names of inanimate objects are, of course, neuter.
2. For some classes of living beibigs we have terms which are applied to
every iltdividual in thle class witlloutt reference to sex, that is, nouns of the
comnoit genlder; and also terms dlenoting the males and females, that is,
nouns of the masculine and feminine genders.
Thus, sheep is of the common gender, ram of the masculine, and ewe of the
feminine.
8. For other classes we have nouns of the common gender only; and when
we wish to denote the males and females, we join to the nouns of the common
gender words that; point out the sex of the objects.
Thus, sparrow i3 of the common gender, and cock-sp  denotes the male,
and hen-sparrow I he female.
4. For other classes we have no nouns of the common gender, but only
those which denote the males and the females.
Thus, horse is of the masculine, and mare of the feminine gender; but
there is nlo name applied to every individual in the class without reference
to sex.
In such cases, if we wish to denote the whole class, we either
(a) Use lboth tlie masculine and feminine nouns: as, " Brothers and sisters
should love each other;" or,
(h) Employ a circumlocution: as, "The children of the same.parents should
love each other;" or,
(e) Use the terni applied to that sex, whether male or female, to which the
attention is most frequenltly directed, to include the whole class. Thus,
when we say, "Horses are graminivorous animals," we include mares; and
when we say, " Geese are noisy," we incllude ganders.

Remarks.-1. When nouns of the common gender are used, we may
often determine, from some circumstance or other, whether males or females
are referred to; but not firom the nouns themselves. So far as the nouns are
concerned, sex is left entirely out of view. It will not do to say that the
nouns are either masculine and feminine, or masculine or feminine. In such
a sentence as this, "John visited his two cousins," we canlnot say that cousins is masculine, for both may be females; we cannot say it is feminine, for
both may be males, we cannot say that cousins is mnascutline and feminine,
for botli cousins may be males, or both may be females; we cannot say that
When nouns of the common gender are used, can we determine whether males or
females are referred to?
* Also written ambastsavr.28                              CASE.
the word is masculine or feminine, for one cousin may be a male and the
other a female.
2. Animals whose sex is unknown, or unnecessary to be regarded, are generally spoken of as neuter; as, " He shot at the deer, and missed it." On the
same principle we say of a child, " It is sick."
3. Though in reality no objects except animals have the distinction of sex,
yet in,figurative language inanimate objects are often regarded as distinguished by sex. Thus we say of the sun, "H e is shining;" or of the moon,
"She is beautiful."
4. When inanimate objects are represented as having sex, the names of
those which are distinguished for strength, power, or other qualities of the
male sex are regarded as masculine; and the names of those distinguished
for beauty, loveliness, or other femininc qualities are considered as feminine.
Thus, the sun, death, tme, winter, war, anger, are masculine; and the moon,
earth, nature, virtue, spring, peace, health, are feminine.
5. A collective nloun, when used properly as such, that is, when it denotes
a sile collection of objects, or is in the plural number, is nleuter; as, " The
army destroyed evwry thing in its course."  But when reference is made to
the objects composing the collection, it takes the gender of the individuals
referred to.
E X E R C I S E S.
1. Name three nouns of the masculine gender;-three of the feminine;-three of the
neuter.
2. Tell the gender of each of the following nouns.

8. Tell the gender of each of the nouns in the exercises on pages 15, 16, and 17.

NOMINATIVE          CASE.
When a noun is the subject of a verb, it is in
the nominative      case; as,' John runs;"        " The dclog
was killed."
Remarks.-1. The subject of a verb is that of which something is affirmed. It may usually be known by its formilng the answer to the question
madcle by putting who or what before thie verb. Thus, if we ask, " Who
runlls?" the answer will be, " John;" if we ask, " What was killed?" the answer will be, " 2Yze clog." John and dog, then, are in the nominative case.
2. The nominative case is sometimnes usedl independent of any verb, especially when an object is addressed; as, "Jane, Mvary is industrious." Jane
is said to be in the nmir7ni ative case independent.
EXERCISES.
Seventeen of the following nouIIns are in the nominative casG: name them. The
words in italics are verbs.
Peter lwhistles.  Jane sings.    Mary   sings sweetly.   The
horse gallops.  Birds fly in the air.    Whales swim in the sea.
Josephine is beautiful.    Benjamin went to town.        Charles is
attenitive. The traveler killed the robber. George saw a deer.
The rabbit jumped into the dog's mouth.       The snake bit the
dog. The elephant is large. The robber was killed by the
traveler.  Joseph jumped two inches.    Solomon excels Joseph.
POSSESSIVE        CASE.
When a noun denotes the relation of properly or
possession, it is in the possessive case; as, "John's
hat."
The possessive case in thle singular number is usually formned
by adding s preceded by an apostrophe ['] to the nominative;
as, William, Williamin's; boy, boy's.
When the nominative plural ends in s, the possessive plural
is formed by adding the apostrophe only; as, boys, boys'.

Whein is a noun said to he in the nomrina- How is the possessive case formed In the
tive case independent?          plural?80
CASE.
When plural nouns do not end in s, they form thlleir posses6ive by taking both the apostrophe and s; as, " Men's hats."
Remark.-When the nominative singular and nominative plural are
alike, some place thlle apostrophe after the s in'the possessive plural, to distingouish it from the possessive singular; as, Singalar, deer's: Plural, deers'.
Sometimes when a word ends with the sound of s, or z, the
addition of s would create a harshness of sound; in which case
the apostrophe alone is added; as, "Goodness' sake;" "Archimedes' screw."
Remark.-No definite rule can be given on this subject; the ear must
decide. We say, "The witness's oath;" "Clarence's dream;" "James's
novels."
In compound words, the sign of the possessive case is placed
at the end; as, "His father-in-law's horse;"      "The    knighterrant's adventure."
EXERCISES.
1. Name six nouns in the possessive case.
2. Write or spell the possessive case of each of the following words.
Man, boy, girl, women, men, boys, girls, John, James, Thomas, beauty, ox, master, mistress, councilman, alderman, aldermen,
ladies.
OBJECTIVE CASE.
W  hen  a  noun    is the   ob'ecl of a transitive verb,
or of a preposition, it is in      the  objective    case; as,' John struck William;" " Thomas jumped over
the log."
Here, William is the object of the verb struck; and log is
the object of the preposition over.
Remarks.-1. The object may generally be known by its forming the
answer to the question made by putting whom or what after the verb or preposition.  Thus, " Johln struck whom?"  Answer.    Villiam.  " Tlhomnas
jumped over what?"  Answer. The log.

EXERCISES.
Thirty of the following, nouns are in the objective ease; name them. The transitive
verbs are in capital letters, and the prepositions in italics.
The snake BIT the dog. The wolf BIT thle horse. John
THREW a stone.    The musician BROIKE his violin.   Peter SAW
his shadow.   Benjamin went to Boston.       Boys LOVE sport.
Mary THREW the book into the fire.    Irene CRACKED a walnut
with a hammer.     George STRUCK a lamp-post with his fist.
Edward went from Louisville to New-Orleans. Birds fly in the
air. Peter INVITED Theodore. Edmund SAW a rabbit. Anne
CUT an apple.   The frost INJURED the corn.     The hurricane
DESTROYED the building. The fox ran through the thicket.
Julius ADMIRED the brightness of the sun.    Rollo ran up the
steps, into the house, and fell over a chair into a tub of water.
The horses DRAW the wagon.
Remark.-The objective case, with the preposition of, is often used instead of the possessive case. Thus, instead of "God's power," we may say,
"The power of God." It is often more correct to employ this construction
than to use the possessive.
E  E R C I S E S.
Change the following in the same way.
John's book. The sun's splendor. Beauty's power. Slavery's chains. God's goodness. The comet's tail. For neatness' sake.
PERSON.
Person denotes the character which the noun
has, according as the object is represented as
speaking, spoken to, or spoken of.
A name applied by the speaker to himself is said to be of the
first person; as, "I, John, saw   it;" "I, the governor, make
this proclamation;" "We men are sinful."

DECLENSION.
A name applied to the object addressed is said to be of the
second person; as, "Theodore, give me my knife;" "Children,
obey your parents."
A noun denoting the object spoken of is of the third person;
as, "John saw it;" "Men are sinful;" "Theodore gave me my
knife."
Remark.-A noun is never the subject of a verb, except when of the
third person.

A D J E C T I VE.
An   adjective     is a word which qualifies or limits
the meaning of a noun; as, "A                   good boy;" "a
sweet apple;        one book;"       l this man."
Remark.-Thle word adjective signifies adding or added; and this part of
speech is so called because it adds a quality or limitation to the meaning of a
noun, or because it is added to a noun.*
CLASSES       OF    ADJECTIVES.
There    are  two    classes of adjectives;         gualfying
adjectives, anld limiling adjectives.
A qualifying adjective expresses some quality
which    belongs    to   the   object; as, "A        bad   road;"
"a ripe lnut;" "a violent storm."
Remark.-Qualifying aldjectives not only express qualities belonging,to
the object, but at the same time limit the cpplication of thlle noun. T'ms, the
expression, "a red apple," does not apply to so umany objects as the word
apple does, since there are not so many red apples are there are apple=. The
more adjectives we add to a noun, the fewer objects we include. The expression, "a sweet, mellow, red apple," comprehends more qualities than "a
red apple," but does nlot extend to so many objects.

* The word adjective is generally said to signify added to; but wvords ending in

This is what grammarians mean when they say that adjectives increase.she comprehension, buLt decrease the extension of notuls. Liminting adjectives
affect only the extension.
Limiting adjectives do not express any quality
belonging to the object; but merely limnit the meaning of the noun; as, " One book;" "the frst man;"
"that thing;" "forty        thieves."
rhose limitinig adjectives which are used in counting and
numbering    are called   numeral adjectives; as, one, two, three,
etc.; first, second, third, etc.
Adjectives derived from proper names are sometimes called
proper adjectives.
Remarks.-1. The limiting adjectives, each, every, either, neither,formner,
latter, some, other, any, one, all, such, none, this, that, and the plural forms,
these, those, are somletimes improperly called adjective pronouns.
2. The reason given for this is, that they somrnetimes belong to nouns like
adjectives, and at other times stand/or nouins like pronouns. Thus, in this
sentenlce, " Each man has his faults," each limits the meanling of the nloun
man; but if man is omitted, it is said that each stands for mn; as, " Each
has his fauits."
8. But it seems hardly correct to represent these adjectives as becoming
pronouns when the noun is omitted. Othler adjectives mighlt be called pronouins on the same grounds. Thus, good mighlt be called a pronoun in this
sentence, "The good may err," becauLse persons is omitted.
Note.-Other and one will be mentioned again when we come to speak of
pronouns.
4. The limiting adcljective what is sometimes called an interrogative pronoun,
when it is used in asking questionls, as, "What man is thlat?T"
5. This and that are the only adjectives which have a different form before
plural nouns.
6. None is used for no, when the noun is omitted; when no is used, the
noun is always expressed. Thus, "N _o person is so deaf that he will not
hear;" "None is so deaf that he will not hear."  None, in this case, should
be parsed as belonging to person undlerstood.  This wordcl was formerly used
whlen tlhe noun was expressed; "We shall have ionie end."-Bacon.

COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.
The   variations, which      adjectives    undergo     when
objects are compared, are called comparison.
When do nouns becomnes adjectives?   I
What is comparison?COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.
37
There are three degrees of comparison; the positive, the conmparative, and the superlative.
The positive degree, or simple form of the adjective, simply expresses the quality of an object,
without reference to other degrees of the same
quality; as, "A      sweet apple."
The comparative is used wvhen the quality is
represented as belonging to one of two objects, or
sets of objects, in a higher degree than to the
other;    as,  " This    apple   is  sweeter    than   that i"
"These apples are sweeter than those."
The superlative is used when the quality is represented as belonging to one of several objects, or
sets of objects, in a higher degree than to any of
the  rest; as, "This      apple   is the   sweetest of all;"
"The rose is the fairest of flowers."
Remarks.-1. The office of the comparative and superlative is not to
express a higher degree of the quality than the positive; the latter may
express a higher degree than eithler of the others. Thus, when we say of all
apple, that it is sweet, we may assert the existence of a greater degree of the
quality than when we say that it is sweeter than sonmec other apple, or the
sweetest of all on the tree.
2. When the comparative is used, a comparison is made-between th:come
quality, usually as it exists in different objects; but sometimnes the comp:x.
ison is made between two degrees of the quality in the same object at different times, or in different circumstances; as, "He is wiser to-day than he was

3. Sometimes the comparison is made between the degree of the quality

"HIis learning is greater than his wisdom."  This is, in reality, a comparison between two objects-learning and wisdonzm.
FORMIATION OF THIE COMIPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE.
The conmparativre is regularly formed by adding
er, and the superlative by adding est, to the positive; as,
Positive              Comparative.              Superlative.
Sweet....................sweeter....................sweetest.
Wise.................... wiser......................wisest.
Red..................... redder.....................reddest.
Dlry.....................ldrier......................driest.
See General Rules for Spelling, iii, v, and vii.
The same chiange in signification is made by prefixing the
adverbs more and most; as, sweet, more sweet, most sweet.
This is the usual way of comparing adjectives of more than
one syllable; as, graceful, more graceful, most graceful; not
gracefuler, gracefulest. In such cases the comparison is made
by the adverb, and not by the adjective.
But words of two syllables, ending in y, or in le after a mute,
or accented on the last syllable, may be regularly compared;
as, Ihappy, happier, happiest; able, abler, ablest; polite, politer,
politest.
Some other adjectives of two syllables are sometimes compared by adding
er and est; as, handsonme, handsomer, handsomest.
Some adjectives are compared in an irregular manner; as,
Positive.  Comparative.  Suyerlative. Positive.  Comparative.  Superlative.

8. The superlative is sometimes formned by adding most to the pog;tive or
comparative; as, inmost, or innermost; hindmost, or hindermost; topmost.
4. A slight degree of qtuality is expres;ed by adding ish; as, sweet, sweet/sh.
5. The adverbs less and least are sometimes utsed with tlhe adcljective, when
the object is represented as having a lower dclegree of the quality thon belongs
to the object or objects with which it is compared; as, " Thllis apple is less
sweet than that."
6. The adverbs more and most, less and least, should not be parsed as part
of the adjective. lMore is an adverb in the comparative degree.
7. Most adjectives, which denote qualities thlat cannot exist in different
degrees, are not comiparedl; as, round, square, two-handed, AlmighTty.
8. But many adjectives which denote invariable qualities are used in tlhe
comparative and superlative tly the best writers; as, "Th-e sighlt is the most
persfee of all our senses."-Addison. By this is meant that the sighlt approaches nlearer to perfection than any othler sense does. Of the same kind
are just, upright, true, honest, complete, accurate, correct, regular, good, white,
safe, etc.
Note 1.-The best writers and speakers in the langutage are in the habit
of constantly using such expressions as more pefect.  Language is not governed by the ruLles of logic. It would be improper to say thlat one thing is
perfect, and another more perfect than that; but when we say that one thilng
is more perfect than anlother, we do not necessarily mean that either is perfect, but merely that one approaches nearer to perfectioln'thlan the other.
One man may be better than anothler, when neithler is perfectly good.* Most
grammarians give incorrect definitions of thl comparative and superlative.

ARTICLES.
The    limiting     adjectives      a   or  an, and      t/he, are
called azrticles.
The is called     the definite, and       a  or an, the indefinite article.
When the definite article is used, wve refer to      some particular object, or class of objects, eitlher before spoken of, or pointed
out in sonme other way.*
When the indefinite article is used, we refer to some one of a
class, but to no particular one.
The word( book is applied to each one of a whole class of objects: if I say,
" Give me a book," I call for any one of these objects: if I say, "Give me
the book," I ask for some particular book.
A  is used before words beginning with consonant sounds; an
before those beginning with vowel sounds; as, a tree, an apple.
The indefinite article originally meant one. An was formerly employed
much more frequently than it is now; n is not added to a to form an, but it
is dropped fiom an to make a.

* The is never used wvhen the noun is omitted, but in its stead, that and t7tose are
employed; as, "The course of life is short, that of glory eternal;" "The duties of mnen
differ from those of wvomen." In these examples that andl those are not utsed in their
usual sense, but in the sense of the. The loun course is lunderstood in the lorier

ARTICLES.ARTICLES.
41
Remarks.-1. In some words beginning with h, this letter is silent, and
the first sound being a vowel sound, an is used, and not a; as, an hour.
2. Some words, whose first letter is a vowel, commence with a consonant
sound, and, consequently, a, and not an, is used before theim; as, a quniversity, a eunuch, a ewe, many a one. University, eunuch, and ewe are pronounced
as if they commenced with y, and one is pronounced wun.
3. An is used before words beginning with h not silent, if the accent is on
the second syllable; as, an heroic action; an historical romance.
The sound of h is weaker, that is, the breath is less forcibly emitted, when
the word is accented on the second syllable, than when the accent is on the
first. The word historical almost seems to begin with a vowel sound.

The is used with noulns either in the singular or the plural number; as, the
book; the books.
A or an is used with nouns in the singular number only. We calnnot say
a books.
A seems to belong to plural nouns in such expressions as the following:"A dozen apples;" "A hundred books;" "-A thousand men;" "A great many
men."
But a does nlot belong to apples, books, and qnen, in the preceding examples,
but to dozen, hundred, and many, which, in such cases, are collective nounls,
in the singular number. There is an ellipsis of the preposition of; thus, a
dozen of men; a great many of men; a hundred of men.
When a is used with nuLmbers greater than thousanlds, of must be expressed; as, a million of mnen. So, in some instances, with a great many; as,
"A great many of those books are worthless."
That hundred, thousand, etc., are nloullns, is evident: they may be used in
thle plural number; as, "Hundreds of men were slain in that battle."

PARSING EXERCISES.
The word many is very often used by the old English writers as a noun
signifying company, retinue, etc.  Thus, "And eke with him cometh his
meinie" [many.]-Chaucer.
Spenser applies the word to three persons in the following passage:
"This fair many were compeld at last.-"
Shakspeare uses a maniy without great; thus,
"For yet cta mnany of your horsemen peer
And gallop o'er the field."-Iem. V, Act iv, Scene 5..fany is a noun in such expressions as the following: "The will of the
many, anld their interests, must very often differ."-Burke.
A is used with a plural noun, when the adjectivefew intervenes; as, afew
books.
This construcetion probably originated from an ellipsis. Ane few menye, a
few menye, (that is, a small numnber or company,) are expressions used by
ancient authors. When many came to be generally used as an adjective opposed in meaning tofew, the two words sounded harshly together, anld many,
with the preposition following it, was dropped. In this manner afew many
of the books was changed to a few books.
A or an often comes between many and a singular noun; as,
"When the merry bells ring round,
And the jocund rebecks sound
To many ca youth and many a mnaidc
Dancing in the checkered shade."-Miltob.
Horne Tooke considers a in such instalnces to be a corruption of oqf. Thus,
many of maids, by corrupting the sound of of, as is frequently done, would
become many a maids; and a being mistaken for the article, the nounl would
afterwards be put in the singular.

i 01 D E L.
"That boy rode the vicious horse."
hat is a limiting adjective - it limits the meaning of a noun; it belongs
to the noun boy.
RULE II.-Adjectives and participles belong to nouns or pronouns.
Boy is a common noun, of the masculine gender, third person, singular
number, in the nominative case- subject of the verb rode.
RULE IV.-The subject of a finite verb is put in the nominative case.
The is the definite article - it refers to a particular object; it belongs to
the noun horse. [Better.-The is a limiting adjective-it limits the meaning
of a noun; it belongs to the noun horse.]
RULE II.-Adjectives ancl participles belong to nouns or pronouns.
Vicious is a qualifying adjective- it expresses a quality belonging to an
object; in the positive degree -it simply expresses the quality; positive,
vicious, comparative, more vicious, superlative, most vicious; it belongs to
the noun horse.
RULE II.--Adjectives and participles belong to nouns or pronouns.
lHorse is a noun, etc.; in the objective case - the object of the transitive
verb rode.
RIULE IX.-The object of a transitive verb is put in the objective case.
" The rose is thefairest of allifowers."
Fairest is a qualifying adjective - it expresses a quality which belongs tm
an object; in the superlative degree - the quality is represented as belonging to onle of several objects in a higher degree than to any of the rest; positive, fair, comparative, fairer, superlative, fairest; it belongs to flower, understood.
RULE II.-Adjectives and participles belong to nouns or pronouns.
How do you parse an adjective?     How do you parse an article?"1 This room is wvarmer thaes that."
Warmer is a qualifying adjective, etc.; in tlhe comparative degree- the
quality is represented as belonging to one of two objects in a higher degree

PRONOUN.
A pronounii is a word which is used instead of a
10loun.
Illustration.-John told Sarahl that John would let Sarah
hlave John's book, if Sarah wished to study Sarah's lesson.
John told Sarah that he would let her hlave his book, if she
wished to study her lesson.
In the latter sentence, he and his, she and her are pronouns,
standing for John and John's, Sarah and Sarah's in the former.
Pro is a Latin word which signifies for or instead of. Pronoun, then,
means instead of a noun.
Remarks.-1. Pronouns are not absolutely necessary for the communication of our thoughts: but lalnguage, without them, would be burdened
with the repetition of nouns.
2. Properly speaking, pronounis stand not mierely for thle nouns, but for
the nouns with all the qualifying words. Thus, "The venerable old man
treated us so kindly, that we were forced to love him." Here him prevents
the repetition, not of man merely, but of the venerable old man.
EXERCISES.
1. In the following enitences, instead of the pronouns putt the nouns for which they
stand.

wait the Sultan's pleasure.     The Sultan ordered the courtiers
to enter, received the courtiers with a more pleasant air than
the Sultan had formerly done, and gave each of the courtiers a
present.
Remarks.--To avoid the repetition of nouns is not the only office of
pronouns. I is a word used by the person speaking, to designate himnself,
but does not stand for his name, or imply any previous mention of himself.
So thou or you is used to dclesignate the person addressed; and we use it
whether we know the name of the individual or not.
lis equivalent to "the speaker;" anld thou or yozs to the "person addressed."
We, the plural of I, is used when thle speaker includes others with himself, or when several are joined in speaking or writing.
Kings, as a mark of pre-eminence, use we instead of I.  We is also used
instead of Iby editors of periodical publications, and often by public speakers
and others, to avoid the appearance of egotism, and for other reasons.
E X E R C I S E S.
1. Put pronouns, where they are admissible, in the following sentences.
The speaker will love the person addressed.       If the person
addressed command, the speaker will obey.           The person addressed did as well as the speaker could do.
2. Instead of the pronouns in the following sentences use their equivalents.
I wished you to do well.       You said you loved me.        How
shall I belive you?
Note.-Though I and "the speaker" convey the same idea, yet their
construction is nlot the same. I takes a verb of the first person, and "the
speaker" takes one of the third,.as all nouns do. A similar remark may be
made with respect to thou, and "theperson addressed."
Remarks.-1. He, she and it refer to persons or things spoken of, and generally imply some previous mention of the objects referred to; as, "Charles
studies, and he will learn;" "Susan is a good girl, and she, will be loved;"
"John saw the deer, and shot it."
2. But these pronouns do not always imply a previous mention of thle objects. In the following sentences he stands for the marn, or something equivalent, and she for the woman. " I-IH  who is just will be rewarded."  "She
who is virtuous will be respected."

For what do he, ste, and they stand in the following sentences?
HIe that trusteth in riches shall fall.   He that is of a perverse

They say this man is honlest.
PIERSONAL        PRIONOUNS.
The   pronouns I     thou, he, she, and it, in their various cases and numbers, are called personal pronouns; because I is always of the first person, thou
of the second, and he, she, and it of the third.
They are thus declined:

Remarks.-1. Where there are two forms of the possessive case, one of
them is used when the name of the thing possessed is expressed; the other
when it is omnitted.
Thus: " That is your book, but this is mine;"I "This is my book, but that
is yours."
JMne and thine were formerly used before a vowel or silent h; as, "Blot out
all mine iniquities."  They are still so used in the solemn style.

2. These words, mine, thine, hers, ours, yoars, theirs, are by some said to
stand both for the name of the possessor and of the thing possessed. This
is nlot correct. The name of the thing possessed is omnitted, because it has
been previously expressed. The nature of the pronoun may be understood
by putting a nloun in its place. Thus: " This is my book, but that is John's."
It w-vuld be as correct to say that John's, in this sentence, stands for both
John's and book, as to say that yours, in the preceding paragraph, stands for
both your and book.
3. The s seems to have been added to our, your, their, and her, to give
them the termination of the possessive case. The ear is more easily recoanciled to the absence of the possessive termination when the pronoun is placcd
before the nlame of the thing possessed, than when it is nlot. His and its
have the possessive termination, and the omission of the noun makes no
change in their form.
4. ln the third person there is a different pronounl for each gender in the
singular number; but in the first and second the same pronouns are used,
whatever may be the gender. The sex of the speaker and theperson addressed
is supposed to be known from their being present, and from other circumstances.
5. Originlally, thou was the only pronoun used in addressing a single person; but from flattery or politeness, you began to be used in such cases;
and it has now entirely usurped the place of thou except in the solemn style.
The Friends, or Quakers, still use thou in common discourse. See remark on
we, page 45.
COIMPOIUND        PERSONAL          PRONOUNS.
When self, (plur. selves,) is added to the personal
pronouns, they are called compound personal pronouns.
These pronouns are used for the sake of emphasis or distinction; or when an action is represented as exerted upon the
agent; as, "I myself did it;" " Hle killed himself."
They have no possessive case, and the objective is the sanme
as the nominative.
In those of the first and second persons, self and selves are
added to the possessive case of the simple pronouns; in those
of the third person self and selves are added to the objective case.

RELATIVE PRONOUNS.
Thus, myself, ourselves; thlyself, yourselves; himself, hArself;
itself, themselves.
Note.-Her is in either the possessive or objective, but for the sake of
uniformity I have considered it as the objective.
EXERCISES.
Correct the errors in the following.
I hurt meself. Thou lovest theeself. You love youself. He
killed hisself. They ruined theirselves. It injured itsself.
Remarks.-1. Self is supposed to have been originally an adjective. It
was joined by the Anglo-Saxons to nouns and pronouns in every case. Thus,
they said what would be equivalent to Iself, myself, mesef; except that self
had a particular termination for each case, as other adjectives had. The old
English writers use it as anl adjectivc; thus, Chaucer says, " The self day,"
that is, the same day; and Shakspeare, "One self king." It afterwards
came to be used as a noun; as, "Oft whip her dainty seyf."-Soenser.
2. It is from its having been used as an adjective, that it is joined to the
objective case; and it is used as a noun when joined to the possessive.
3. It is from its being used as a noun, that, when all adjective comes between the pronoun and self, the possessive case of the noun is used; as, his
own self.
4. For the same reason, when the plural form of the first and second persons is used for the singular, sey'remains in the singular; as, "John, you
injure yourself."
"Madam, we will outrself take time to hear."-Daniel.
"Ouerself will swiftness to your nerves impart."-Pope.
5. These pronouns are seldom used in the nominative case, except when
annexed to the simple pronounls.
R ELATIYV E      P1'I ONO U N S.
Who, which, what, and            that are    called    relative
pronouns, when they relate to some word or phrase
called   the   antecedent;*     as, " The     boy   who    studies
will learn."
In this sentence who relates to boy, as its antecedent.
Other pronouns have antecedents; thus, "The boy studies,

* Antecedent means going before.RELATIVE PRONOUNS.
and he will learn." In this sentence he relates to the word boy,
which is its antecedent.
Remark.-The name connective pronoun would better express the nature
of these words. The relative not only stands in the place of the noun, but
closely connects the clause in which it stands to the antecedent. In this example, "The boy who studies will learn," the relative clause, who studies, is
closely connected with the antecedent, boy, and modifies it like an adjective.
Who studies is equivalent to stdiouds.
Who is applied to persons; as, "This is the man who came;"
"She whlo is amiable will be loved."
Which is applied to the lower animals, and to inanimate
things; as, "This is the ox which destroyed the corn;" "This
is thle tree which bears the best fruit."
That is applied to any thing to which either who or which
may be applied; as, "This is the man that came;" "She that
is amiable will be loved;" "This is the ox that destroyed the
corn;" "This is the tree that bears the best fruit."
What is applied to things, and is used only when the antecedent is omitted; as, "lIe got what he wvanted," that is, the
thing which he wanted.
That is a relative when who, which, or whom      may be substituted for it.
Thus "He that studies will learn;" " Every thing that has life is an animal;" "This is the man that I saw."  Who may be substituted for that in
the first example, which in the second, andl whom in the third.

1. In which of the following sentences is t7tat a relative?
Hle that acts wisely deserves praise. It is said that Solomonr
was a wise man. I know that man. They that are whole
need not a physician, but they that are sick. Bless them that

2. Name the relatives and antecedents in the following sentences.
A king who is just makes his people happy. This is the
man whomn we met. This is the man that we met. All are
pleased with children that behave well. This is the tiger that
broke from his cage. This is a beautiful dog that you have.
The books which I gave him are for you. God, by whose kindness we live, whom we worship, who created all things, is
eternal. Alexander, who conquered the world, was conqueredcl
by his passions. He that does not make happy, deserves not
to be happy. This is the dog, that bit the cat, that caught the
rat, that ate the malt, that lay in the house, that Jack built.
He who steals my purse steals trash. The person who does no
good does harm.
ANTECEDENT O3MITTED.
The antecedent is sometimes omitted; as, " Who
steals my purse steals trash;" that is, he who, or
the person who.
EXERCISES.
Tell the antecedents to the following relatives.
Who does no good does harm. Whom the Lord loveth he
chasteneth. Whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes mad.
W~hom he will he hardeneth. There are who put their trust
in riches. Who worship God shall find him.
"This day have I begot, whom I declare
My only Son."
Is the antecedent always expressed?ANTECEDENT OMIITTED.                       51
"And who but wishes to inlvert the laws
Of order, sins against the Eternal Cause."
The relative what is never used except when
the  antecedent is       omitted; which       is used when it
is expressed. Therefore, if we omit the anitecedent
we must use what instead of which, and if the antecedent is restored to its place, which must follow
and not what.
Thus, "I saw what I wanted to see."       Here the antecedent
to what is thing understood; if we express the antecedent thing,
which will take the place of what; as, "I saw the thing which
I wanted to see."
Remark.-Various opinions have been entertained about the nature
of the relative what. It is said to be a compound relative prIonoIln, including
both the antecedent andcl the relative, and equivalent to that which or the thing
which. Though this may seem plausible, yet we shall find, onl examination,
that what is nothing more thln a relative pronoun, andcl inceludes nothing else.
Compare these two sentences:
"I saw whom I wantedl to see;"
" I saw what I wanlted to see."
If what, in the latter, is equivalent to that which, or the thing which, whom,
in the former, is equivalent to him whom, or theperson whom; and who, in
this sentence, "Who steals my purse steals trash," is equivalenlt to he who,
or the man ivho.
And, on the saite principle, when the relative is omitted, the antecedent
should be represented as equivalent to the relative and the antecedent.
Thus, "I saw the man I wanited to see."  Here man should be lrepresented
as equivalent to man, whom.
The cause of the error in respect to what is that the antecedent is never
expressed with it. It is nlot like the word who, which is usedcl both when the
antecedlent is expressed, and when it is omitted. The relative that, however,
was formerly used in many cases where we use what, that is, with the antecedent omitted. A few examples of this will help us to ascertain the nature
of what.
"We speak t7hat we do know."-Englis76 Bible.
"I am that I am."'-Eaglishb Bible.

"Eschewe ftat Nvicked is."-Gowoer.
"Is it possible he should knowN what he is, and be that he is?"-S7iakspeare.
"Gather the sequel by that went before."-Sh7acspeare.
In these examples that is n relative; and is exactly synonymous witla w7hat.
No one would contend that that stands for itself and its antecedent at the
same time. The antecedent is omitted because it is inldefinite, or easily
supplied.
Some consider 1Jzat, in suchi sentences as these, an adjective (demonstrative adjective pronoun,) and say that the relative is iunderstood; but if we
examine carefully, we shall see.that this is not correct. In the first quotation from the Enlglish Bible, that is a translation of the Greek relative, and
in the second it is a translation of the Hebrew relative.
It is no objection to this view that the antecedent cannot be expressed
before what. The pronouns o07rs, yours, etc., cannot be employed when the
noun is expressed. The relative that may be governed by a preposition
coming after it; but if tlhe preposition should comne first, that must be changed
into whom or which. It will not be contended that that is not governed by
the preposition because it wvill not admit the preposition before it.
In the Anglo-Saxon language thle neuter gender of hwua (who) was not hwik'which), but whaet (what); and the genitive and dative cases, whaes and'~ham, were the same in all the genders. This shlows that what originally
had the same relation to nouns of the neuter gender that who hlad to those of'e masculine.
The Germans use was (what) in many instances where we use which, or
eat; "Alles was ich sah, gefiel mir," (All what I saw, pleased me.)
COM[POUND RELATIVE PRONOUNS.
When ever, or soever is annexed           to  relative    pronouns, they are called compound relative pronouns.
They are used only when the antecedent is
omitted on account of its         being   indefinite; and      in
such cases they are more commonly used than the
simple pronoun.
Thus, "WVhoevcr steals my purse steals trash;" "Whoever
does no good does harm;" "Whatever purifies fortifies the
heart."  In the first two examples the antecedent is person, or
something equivalent; in the last it is thing.

COMPOUND RELATIVE PRONOUNS.
Remarks,-1. These words, ]ike the relative what, have been said to be
"equivalent to the relative anld the anltecedent."  The same answer may be
made here as ill thie case of what. The antecedent is omitted, and not included in the relative.
These words are comipound relatives, it is true; but they are inot compoutnded of the relative anld thlle anltecedent, but of the relative and the adverb ever.  This adverb primarily refers to time, but also means in any
degree, and is sometimes used as " a word of lenforcement or emphasis;" as,
"He studies as muchl as ever he can."  In composition with the relative it is
generally "a word of enforcement or emphasis."
Thius, "Whoever sins will suffer."   This means that any one, without
exception, who sins, will suffer.
Thle adverb has Ino influence on the nature of the relative. It was anciently
written separately.
The impropriety of considering the colmpound relative equtivalent to the
antecedent and the relative may be seen from sucl sentences as the following: "I love whoever loves me."    Here whoever is in the nominative case,
and, of course, cainnot be the object of the verb love. The object of that verb
is omitted, because it is indefinite.*
The antecedent was sometimnes expressed by the old writers. Thus,
" No man knowethl the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
will reveal him."--Ensligsh Bible.
"Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me."-1bid.
"And thither also came all other creatur'es,
Whatever life or motionl do retaine."-Spenser.
2. Formerly so was sometimes used instead of ever or soever; as, W Whoso
findeth me findeth life."-E-ngl'sh Bible.
Of what are they compounded?
* WTomsoever in the followving quotations should be whosoever, or wthoever.
"As may be learnled by whomnsoever will take the trouble to consult our old church
records."-O. A. Broowvson.
"Yet threefourths of his life was employed( in helping wthomsoever had needcl of his
purse, of his talents, of his inanagement."-Catrlyle.
In the flirst quotqtion the relative is not the object of the preposition by, but the
nominative to the verb'viil tacke. The relative iin the second quotation is nominlative
to the verb h7ad, and not the olhject of helpins.
In the following the nominative case of the relative is properly used.
"And twenty curses on who8oever' had brought him thither."-Jarvis's Translation
of Don Qseixote.
"The Gaul, with sutperior magnanimity, offered his owvn head to whoever should
bring hiim that of Ne ro."--efTurphey's Tacitzs.
"Harbors and bays are admitted to belong to whoever has dominion over the neigh.
boring land."-Leiber.
"They punished with the severest tortures whoever dared to secrete any part of
the consecrated offering."-H-eume.
"With whosoe'er of all the invading host
Relies upon his sword, his prowess, most."--Hfnt's Taso.54
INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.
3. The antecedent is sometimes repeated with the relative; as, " John has
a beautiful knife, which kiffe was given him by his fatherl"  Which is here
a limiting adjective belonlging to knife.
4. What and whatever are sometimes joined to nouns as limiting adjectives; the same nouns are tlhen understood as antecedents.
Thus, " What books he has are of the best kind." Here what is joined as
a limiting adjective to books, which is the object of the verb has; books, understood, is the antecedent, and the subject of the verb are.
5. What and whatever are joined as adjectives to nouns denoting persons,
instead of who and whoever, which are never used as adjectives. Thus,
VWhat mcan but enters dies."
" Heaven bestows its gifts on whatever man will use them."
The subject of dies in the first example is the antecedent man understood;
the object of the prepositionl on in the second is the antecedent man understood.
INTERIROGATIVE PRONOUNS.
Who, which, and what, when used in asking questions, are   sometimes     called   interroyative pronouns.
Thus, c Who is here?" " Whkich book will you have?"
Whalct do you see?"
Which and what in interrogations may always be considered
as limiting adjectives belonging to nouns expressed or understood.  In the last example thing is understood.        Who is
equivalent to what person.
These words are often used in dependetnt clauses when there
is no direct question, as, " Tell me who is here;" "I know who
is here;" "He asked whlat I saw;" "Teach me what is truth;"
"Tell me in which house you live."
In some of these examples a question is asked indirectly; all
of them have some reference to a question. In such cases these
words are called indefinite pronouns.   The object of the verb
in the independent clause is the whlole of the dependent clause.
Thus, the object of tell in the first example is the whole of
the clause who is here.
What words are sometimes called inter- What are these words called in indirect
rogative pronouns?           I  questions?ONE, AS, AND     OTHER.                    5
Remark.-It is improper to consider these words as relative pronouns.
" I know the man who is here," conveys an entirely different idea from "I
know who is here."  "Teaoh me what is truth and what is falsehood," is
an indirect way of asking, " What is truth, and what is falsehood'" It does
not mean, "Teach me that which is truthl, and that which is falsehood,"
which would be equivalent to "Teach me truth, and teach me falsehood."
EXERCISES.
In which of the following sentences are who, which7t, and what relatives; in which
are they interrogatives; anld in which indefinites?
You know not who I am.      In what house do you live? Tell
me in what house you live.     Tell me in whose house do you
live.  O, Diamond, you know not what mischief you have done!
Whom did you see? I will not tell whom I saw. I saw whom
I wanted to see.    In what character was he admitted?        In
what character he was admitted is unknown.*       I will not ask
who you are.    He was unwilling to declare to what place he
was going.   To what place he went is not known.        He who
tries will learn.
ONE, AS, AND         OTHER.
One, is sometimes used in an indefinite sense, referring to
mankind at large; as, "One should pity the afflicted."        In
such phrases one may be considered as a pronoun, used instead
of person, or some equivalent word.
In the following examples it stands instead of a repetition of
some noun which precedes it.    "He took the old bird and left
the young ones;" "He admired virtuous statesmen, but despised
corrupt ones."
It is sometimes used instead of person,, or something equivalent; as, "The forsaken one;" "The loved ones;" "Any one;"
Many a one."
As is sometimes used as a relative pronoun; as, " He assoFor what does one stand in such sentences  bird, and left the young ones?"-in such

ciates with such persons as please him;" " He wants as many
books as he can get."
Some suppose an ellipsis in such cases; thus, "He wants
such books as those which he can get."*
When the noun to which the limiting adjective other belongs
is omitted, and would have been in the possessive case or plural
number, the termination of the noun is added to other; as,
"Regard the rights of others," that is, other persons.
Formerly other was used even when a plural noun was omitted; as, "Those other which I have in hand."-Bacon. "That
he awaken when the other do."-Shakspeare.       Other adcljectives
were sometimes used in the same way that othler is; as,
"And left the earth to be the wicked's den."-Bacon.
" The rich man's joys increase, thepoor's decay."-Gold&amp;mith.
Another is properly two words, an, and other.
One other anjd each other are used in a reciprocal sense; as,
"They loved one another;" "They loved each other."          One
another and each other may be considered as in the objective
case after the verb loved; but in reality one and each, or the
nouns to which they belong, are in the nominative to loved understood, and other in the objective case after the same verb.
Thus, "They loved, each loved the other;" or with the nouns
expressed, "They loved, each person loved the other person."

VERB.
A verb is a word by which something is affirmed; as, " John     runs;"     Caesar was killed;"
"James will sludy.
That of which something is affirmed is called the
sublJc1 of the verb.     In the preceding examples,
Johk, Ccesar, and James are the subjects.
T'~e affirmation may be absolute; as, "I walk;" or it may
be expressed in the form of a condition; as, "If I should walk;"
or of a question; as, " Does he walk?" or of a command; as,
John, sit down;" or of a wish; as, " May you prosper."
The infinitive mood is the noun form of the verb, as the
participle is the adjective form. An affirmation cannot be
made by means of either.
EXERCISES.
1. Tell the verbs anid subjects in the following sentences.
John walks. William reads. The horse gallops. The sun
shines, Peter hopped. Pompey was defeated. James will
learn. The horse will gallop.
Brutus killed Csesar. Caesar defeated Pompey. James will
learn his lesson. John walks every day. William reads amusing books. The horse gallops through the wood. The sun
shines brightly. You should study. You should study diligently. James should study his lesson diligently. Joseph has
comne. Joseph has not come. Joseph has not come home.

-in that house.     God     just.   The horse -   fast.  Ireneon a chair.  Benjamin-     on a bed.
CLASSES OF VERBS.
Verbs are either transitive or intransitive.
A transitive verb requires the addition of an object   to  complete      the   sense;     as, " John      strikes
George;"      He excels me."
An intransitive verb does not require the addition
of an object to complete the sense; as, "The horse
runs;" "Peter sleeps;" "44 Mary is good.'
Remarks.-1i. The word transitive mneans passing over; ant vaerbs of this
class are so called, because the actionl is represented as passing over from the
subject to the object.
2. As the object of a transitive verb is in the objective case, any verb which
makes sense with me, thee, him, her, us, or them, is a transitsvb verb.
Thus, we may know that strikes is a tranrsitive verb by its making sense
with him after it; as, "John strikes him;" but "John sleeps him," would
not make sense.
3. The same verb may be transitive in one sense, and intransitive in another; thus, in the senltence, "He believes my story," believes is transitive;
but in this phrase, " He believes in God," it is intranlsitive.
4. Observe that when a preposition immediately follows the verb, the verb
is not transitive. In the sentence "He believes in God," the verb believes is
followed by the preposition in, and the noun God is the object of that preposition and not of the verb.

2. Form three sentences containing transitive verbs-three containing intransitive
verbs.
With respect to form, verbs are regular or irregular.
A verb is regular when the past tense and the
auxiliary perfect participle are formed by adding
ed to the imperfect (or present) infinitive; as,
Imp. or Pres. Infin.     Past.        Auxiliary Perfect Participle.
Trust,............trusted,............trusted;
Hope............hoped,............hoped;
Drop............dropped,.... dropped;
Dry............. dried............     dried.
Note.-When ed is annexed to 7ope, e is dropped from hope; when ed is
annexed to drop, p is doubled; when ed is annexed to dry, y is changed to i.
See General Rules for Spelling, iii, v, and vii.
A verb is irregular when the past tense or perfect participle is formned some other way.
Imp. or Pres. Infin.     Past.        Auxiliary Perfect Participle.
Write............wrote............written.
Do..............did..............done.
A defective verb is one which wants some of its
parts.
An auxiliary verb is one which is used in conjugating other verbs.
VOICES.
Transitive verbs have two forms, usually called
the active and passive voices.
When is a verb regular?       What is an auxiliary verb?
When Is a verb irregular?     How many voices have transitive verbs?
What is a defective verb?  62                           voIcEs.
When     the   active   voice   is  used, the      subject is
represented     as acting; as, C Brutus killed           Caesar."
When the passive voice is used, the subject is
represented     as being acted      tpon;    as,   ~ C0sesar was
killed by Brutus."
Remarks.-1. The two expressions, "Bruttus killed Cesar," and " Cesar
was killed by Brutus,"' convey the sanme idea; but in the former the attention
is directed to Brutus as performinlg the action, in the latter, to Cssar as
affected by the action. In the formner, the suLbject, Brutus, is active, in the
latter, the subject, Ccesar, ispcassive.
2. The word passive is dclerived from a Latinl word which means to sulfer;
and the name is givenl to this form, because the subject is represented as
suffering or undergoing the action.
Any sentence containing a transitive verb in the active form
may be so altered as to conlvey the same sense with the verb in
the passive form.
That which is the object in the active becomes the subject in
the passive; and the subject of the active is put in the objective
case, after the preposition by.    Thus, "The dog bit the cat,"
may be changed into "The cat was bitten by the dog."
EXERCISES.
Change the following sentences so as to convey the same meaning with the verb in
the passive.
The boy reads the book. We praise virtue. He cuts the
wood.   The wind shakes the tree.        She sees a house.     We
hear a noise.   Anthony loved Cleopatra.     Washington defeated
Cornwallis. Virtue produces happiness. Nero burned Rome.
Men should read the Bible.
Remarks.-1. When the active voice is used, the object may be omnitted;
thus, we may say, "Peter reads," without affirming whether he reads a
book, a newspaper, or a letter. When the passive is used, the name of the
agent may be omittedcl; thus, we may say, " The book is read," without declaring by whom.

voice is used?63
MOODS.
2. It is convenient to use this form when we do not know, or when we
know and do not wish to name, the agent; as, "My pen has been spoiled."
The same idea, however, may be represented, though not so well, by the
active; as, "Somebody has spoiled my pen."
3. The passive is sometimes used merely to give variety, when the active
would express the meaning as well.
4. An intransitive verb canlnot be used in the passive form, since it hlas no
object in the active to become the subject of the passive. But intransitive
verbs, followed by prepositions, are sometimes usedcl in the passive, the
object of the prepositioa becoming the subject of the passive.
Thus, to smile is inltransitive, and we cannot say, " He was smiled by her;"
but we may say, " She smiled on him;" "He was smiled on by lher."
5. Some wvould call ona an adverb in the passive form, but nlot correctly;
was smiled on should be considclered a compound verb, for the passive is used
only because smiled on in the active is treated as a transitive verb. In parsing the active, however, we should parse the words as they are-smiled as an
intransitive verb, and on as a preposition.
6. Sometimes even a verb, a noun, and a preposition, are treated as a compound verb, and used in the passive voice; as, " His character was lost sight
of in that transaction."
7. Intransitive verbs are sometimes followed by the objective case of a
noun of kindred signification to their own, and this objective may be the
subject of the passive: as, "John ran a race;" "A race was run by John."
To verbs, besides voices, belong moods, tenses,
numbers, and persons.
MOODS.
Moods are different manners of expressing the
action or state.
There are commonly reckoned five mluoods; the
indicative, the sublunctive, the potential, the imnperative, and the infinitive.

state as doubtful, or contingent; as, "He will escape punishment, if he repent."
The Potential mood asserts the power, liberty,
possibility, necessity, or duty        of performing an action, or being    in  a  state; as, " I can      run;" " You
may rest;" " John may learn, perhaps;" "He must
study."
The Imperative mood is used in commanding, exhorting, entreating, or permitting; as, "Study your
lesson;" " Obey     your parents;" "Save my child;"
"Go in peace."
The Infinitive mood expresses the action or state
without limiting it to any person or thing as its
subject; as, " To play is pleasant."
Remarks.-1. The subjunctive mood is so called because it is used in a
clause which is subjoined to another clause. It is usuially connected with
the leading clause by a conjunction; such as, if, that, unless, though, lest.
The conjunction is somietimes omitted; as, "Were he poor, he would be
happier," that is, if he were poor.
The indicative and potential moods may also be used in subjoined clauses;
as, "He will escape punishment, if he should repent;" " He is respected,
though he is poor." The subjoined clause may come first; as, " If he repent, he will escape punishment."
2. The potential mood may be known by the signs may, ean, must, migt,
could, would, shozuld.
3. Bothl the indicative andcl the potentiW. may be used in asking questions;
as, "Havae you a knife?" " fay I go?"
4. The potential is sometimes used to express a wish; as, "fay you
prosper 1"
5. The infinitive may usually be known by the sign to prefixed; as, to
love; to learn. The inlfinitive partakes of the nature of the verb and of the
noun, as the participle partakes of the nature of the verb and of the adjective.
6. The sign to is by some called a preposition, but it resembles the preposition to in nothing but form; it has none of the properties of a preposition;

v shows no relation between words. In the sentence, "To play is pleasant," to cannot be said to denote a relation between play ancld any other word.
lb, withl the infinitive in English, anlswers the samie purpose that peculiar
termin,ations cio in othler languages. The infinitive imay be thle object of a
preposition; as, "lIe is about to go."  Other prepositions were foirmerly
used before this mood; as, " \What went ye out/ji to see l'-Engylish Bible.
"Anid each the otherfrnom to rise restrained?"-Spenser. In these examples,
to go, to see, to rise, are governed by prepositions as sinlgle words. The infinitive may be the object of a transitive verb; as, "Jolhn loves to read." W hat
does Johln love? To read. This inlfinitive is the object of the transitive verb
0loVes, and if to is a preposition, a preposition nmaiy come between a transitive
verb and its object.
Horne Tooke says that to has the same origin as do; and is indeed the same
word. " Tihe verbs in EnLglish not being dlistilguislhetd, as in otler langut'ges,
by a peculiar termination, and it being sometimes imipossible to distiniguishl
themn by theirplace, when thc old termination of the Ang1lo-Saxon verbs w.as
dropped, this wvord to (i. e. act) became necessary to be prefixed, in order to
distinguish thetn from nouns, and to invest tlhem with the verbal clharacter;
for there is no difference between the NOUN, love, and the VEnB, TO love, but
what miust be comprised in the prefix T)."-Diversions of Purley. Vol. i,
286. "And for the same reason that TO iS put before the infillitive, DO used
formerly to be put before such other parts of the yERBn whlich li kewise were
not distinguishied fromn thlle noun by termination. As we still say, Ido love,
instead of I love. Andl  doed or did love, instead of I loved."-Ibid., 291.
Thus it seems that Horne Tooke colisiders te an auxiliary verb.
NiOTE     ON    THE     MOODS.
I have followed the common arrangement of the moods, without being
satisfied with it. There seemns to be no sufficient foundation for either the
subjunctive or the potenltial. Neitlier of these mloods seems to be defined
by distilnct boundaries.
"The subjunctive mood," says Murray, "represents a thing unlder a coIndition, motive, wish, supposition, etc.; and is preceded by a conjunctionI
expressed or understood, and attended by another verb."  He, very correctly, we think, follows Dr. Lowth and "the most correct and elegalnt
writers, in limiting the conjLuncetive termination of the principal verb to the
second and third persons singular of the present te.se."*
This definition incluides forms whielh Mr. Murray does not assign to thllis
mood, and excludes some which hle does. In thte sentence, "It ltie go, lio
will return," go is said to be in thle subjunctive mood; precisely the same
idea is expressed by "If l he should go, he will return," and yet should go is
placed in tlhe potential mood. The definition includes the whole of the potential mood when used after certain conjunctions, and thle presence of thlese
conjLunctions changes the indicative, the preseett excepted, into the subjune* Such forms as tft1 ot loved, if tots have loved, thotugh sometimes usedl, "are not
warranted by the genoral practice of correct writers."

MOODS.
tive. The "conjunctive form" is used after some adverbs; as, "Blow til
thou burst thy wind."-}Shakspeare.  "Until the day dawn, and the day-star
arive in your hearts."-English Bible. "Ye do show the Lord's death till he
come."-English Bible. "Till thou return."-Watts.      "Befbre it come to
pass;" " Before the cock crow."-English Bible. This "conjunctive form"
in such cases, however, is excluded by the definition from the subjunctive
mood.*
Some of the expressions which Mr. Murray uses while dcliscussing this
subject, would lead us to suppose that he considered the conjunctlon a part
of the verb in the subjunctive. "There appears to be as muich propriety in
giving a conjunction the power of assisting to form the subjunctive mood, as
there is in allowing the particle to to have an effect in the formation of the
infinitive mood."  But he does not carry out his principle: whenever to is
used before a verb, there is always an infinitive, but Mr. Murray does not say
that if'used before a verb always forms a subjunctive.f
The use of the "conjunctive form" is rendered perfectly intelligible, if we
suppose an ellipsis of the "auxiliary" velb. We can then easily understand
why the "circumstances of contingency and futurity must concur," whlen
this form is used-the conjulnction expresses the contingency,J alcnd the verb
the futurity. We can also see why this form may be used after some adverbs.
"I will respect him, though he chide me;;" that is, though he should
chide.
"He will not be pardoned, unless he repent;" unless he shall repent.
"That thou appear not unto men to fast;" that thon mayest appear.
"Before the cock crow;" shall crow.
"Till the Lord come;"' shall come.
The full form and the elliptical are sometimes used together, as in the following passage: "If thou turn away thy foot firom the Sabbath, firom doing
thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the
Lord, honorable, anld shalt honor him."-Isaiah lviii. 13.
Here the verbs refer to the samne time, and yet Mr. Murray would place
turn and call in the present tense, and shalt honor in the future. Those who
* M; IMurray says, "The second and third persons, in both numnbers, of the second
future tense of all verbs, require a variation fioro the folaris which those tenses have
in the indicative miood." Thus, " Ile will have comipleted the work by mildsiunmmer,"
is the indlicative formn; but the subjunctive is, "If he shall hlave completed( the work
by mi(lsummnier." But this form is used not only after conjunctionls, but after many
adverbs, such as when, till, (ifter, betbre, etc.; and even after relative prono uns; as,
"When he shall have accomplished the work;" "He will pay even every one who
shall have completed the work assigned him."
+ Mr. Murray seems not to have understood correctly what is meant when it is said
that conjunctions zovern moods. If there wvere a d(listincet form for the subjunctive
moo(d, then a coinjunction nmigilt be said( to govern the sutbjunctive, if it required that
particular form to follow it; but Mr. Murray represents the conjunction not as governisW  btut as creating the subjunctive.  
$ So far as the verb is concerne(d, the subjunctive "declares" as much as the indicative; it is the conjunction which expresses the contingency.MOODS.                                 67
limit the subjunctive to the present and imperfect tenses, would assign turn
and call to the present subjunctive, and shalt honor to the future indicativenot only to different tenses, but to different moods, although there is' no difference either in contingency or time.
The Potential. This mood seems to have no better foundation than the
subjunctive. All the forms which are assigned to this mood consist of the
indicative and infinitive of two verbs, the sign to of the infinitive being
omitted. "I can write." Here "I can'" is a positive affirmation of my ability: no verb in the inldicative expresses a more positive and absolute assertion. The omission of to before write is certainly not sufficient to justify us
in forming a distinct mood; if it were, we ought either to assign bid,feel,
let, etc., and the verbs joined with them, to this mood, or form another mood
for them.
The definition of the mood is taken from thie meaning of the verbs, and the
namne is derived from the meaning of one of them. Onl the same principle
that can write is called the potential mood, love to write would be called the
loving mood; wish to write, the wishing or optative mood, etc. If we were to
take, for instance, love to write, wish to write, endeavor to write, intend to write,
class them together in a distinct mood, and give this mood a name derived
firom the meaning of one of the verbs placed before the infinitive, it would
be calTying out the principle on which the potential is formed. This mood
would be thus defined: "The optative mood implies love, desire, intention,
or endeavor."
The objection to the existence of this mood does not rest on the fact that
auxiliaries are employed to form it. If may, can, etc., were really employed
as auxiliaries, the objection would not exist; but it is because these words
seem to havethe characteri tics of pe ncipal verbs, that we think there is no
such mood as the potential.*
I would proprose a division having reference to the subject of the verb.
There would then be three moods.
1. The indicative, with which the subject is usually expressed;
2. The imperative, with which the subject is usually omitted;
3. The in.finitive, which has no subject.
Or, perhaps it would be better to define these three moods in the usual
way. The including of the "Subjunctive" in the indicative would not interfere with the definition, for the "subjunctive"' declares, as much as the "indicative" does, so far as the verb is concerned; the only difference between
he has loved and if he has loved consisting in the colnjunction.
* In the perfect tense, for instance, we find real auxiliaries; as, "I have written."
Here have is not employed in the same sense which it has as a principal verb, and
written is not used as a simple participle. From the juxtaposition of these two words
arises an idea which is not merely the sum of those expressed by ihave and written
when used separately (have+wivtte,;) as firom the chemical union of two substances
arises a tertim quitd, or third substance, which is not either of the original substances,
nor both added together. We may trace the original meaning of have, but it is peculiarly modified by its connection with the participle.68
TENSES.
TENSES.
Tenses are modifications of the verb to denote
the relation of the event to time.
There are three divisions of time; present, past,
and future.
RItemark.-Strictly speaking, present time is merely the point at which
tile past and tile fature mieet; atld if we take the smnallest imaginable point
of timie for the presenlt, this portiou will contain soine of the past and somne
of thle future. TiLus, if we atssumne this hour as tile presenlt time, a part of
the hiour is, past and a part to come; so if we take thllis minulte or second..But we imay take any portion of timie-a day, a year, or at century-and Consider tiie whole of it as constituting present time, ald the rest of time as past

M 11any great works have been wrvitten in this centur/;" "A great clhtnge
has taken place since the birth oj/ Clhist." In the last example, the whole
perioct fromi the birth of Christ, includ(ling tlhe morefiit of speaking, is taken
as present time.' Manlay earthquakes hlave occurred since the creation."
Here the creation is the beginninig of the. time which is assumecld aLs present.
EXERCISES.
What division of time is referred to in each of the following sentences?
I walked yesterday.     I walk to-day.    I wvill walk to-morrow.
John  loves Jamies.   Yout studly well to-day.   COesar defeated

FORMIATION       OF  THE    PERFECT      TENSES.
I have is the present tense of the verb to have; I had is the
past tense, and I shall have tlhe future tense of to have.  Written is the auxiliary perfect participle of the verb to write.
The perfect tenses are composed of the present, past, and
future tenses of the verb to have and the auxiliary perfect
participle of the principal verb, whichl in the present instance
is to write.  Tlhe tense of the verb to have denotes thlle timle,
and. the perfect participle denotes the completion of the action.

TENSES.TENSES.
Remarks.-1. To denote an action or state as imperfet, that is, as going
on and not completed, the various tenses of the verb to be are used with the
imperfect participle. Thus,

Presentt Perfect ent Tense. P i Fture Perfect Tense.
[I have been wriiting.  I had been writing. ~  XI shall have been writing.
2. Some Verbs, firom the nature of their signification, denote the continuance of the action; as, " I know him."  These have none of the imperfect
forms: " I am knowing him," is not used.
PRESENT TENSE.
The Present tense expresses what takes place in
present time;       as, "I love; I am        loved."
Remnarks.-1. Any existing custom or general truth may be expressed
by this tense; as, " Thomas visits me every day;" " Viceproduces misery."
2. In animated narration, this tense is sometimes usecld to express past
events; the speaker is supposed to become so much interested that the
events seem to be passing before him; as,
"Whlat sounds upon the miidnight wind
ApproacA so rapidly behind?
It is, it is, the tramp of steeds,
Matilda hears the sound, she speeds;
Seizes upon the leader's rein.'"
This tense is sometimes used, in dependent clauses, to express
future events, chiefly after when, as soon as, till, after, before,
and after relative pronouns; as, "I shall see him          when he
comes," that is, shall have come; "I will go when John rises,"
that is, shall have risen; "You will inot see clearly till dayligl-ht appears;" "I shall get a letter after the mail arrives;"
"Hle will not get a letter before the mail arrives;" "He will
kill every one whom he mneets."
Remark.-Tlhls tense may be used in speaking of an author long since
dead, when we reifer to his' works which still exist; as, "Virgil imitates
Homer."

TENSES.
PRESENT       PERFECT        TENSE.      [PERFECT.]
The Present Perfect tense represents an action
or state as perfect or finished, in present time; as,'"I  have   walked    to-day;"      John     has studied    this
week;" " Manly excellent works have been wzritten
in this century."
Note.-The time is present, though the action or state is past; this tense
cannot be used, if the smallest portion of time has intervened between that
which is assumed as present, and that in which the event took place.
Thus it wouldc be incorrect to say, " I have see himn a moment ago."
Remarks.-1. This tense may be used when we speak of an author long
since dead, when the works to which we refer are still in existence; as,
" Milton has written some noble works."
Here we refer not so much to the act of writing, as to Milton's character as
a writer, as shlown in the works which still exist. But if the works did not
remain, we should say, " Milton wrote;" and evenl if the work is extant, if
we refer to the act of writing, we use the past tense; as, " Milton wrote Paradise Lost."
2. This tense, as well as the present, is sometimes used in dependent
clauses to express a future event; as, " When he has finitshed his studies, he
will go home," that is, when he shall have finished.
P A S T TENSE.       [IMPERFECT.]
The Past tense expresses what took place in
past time; as, " I wrote a letter yesterday;" "God
created the world;" "Cmesar was killed by           Brutus."
Remarks.-1. This tense is used only when the time has completely expired; but we sometimes say, " He walked to-day," referring to a portion of
the day which has expired.
2. As the present time sometimes denotes a present custom, so this tense
sometimes denotes a past custom; as,
"Thirty steeds, both fleet and wight,
Stood saddled in stable day and night,
A hundred more.fed fiee in stall;Such was the custom in Branksome Hall."
Define the present perfect tense.   Define the past tense.

The Pacst Perfect tense represents an action or
state as perfect or finished    at some past time referred  to; as, "I had      written   a letter when     he
arrived;" "The ship had sailed before he reached
Boston."
FUTURE.
The Future tense expresses what will take place
hereafter; as, " Ge6rge will go to town, and I shall
see him."
Remark.-A future custom may be expressed by this tense; as, "The
wolf also shall dwell with the lamlb, and the leopard shall lie down with the
kid." "And the lion shall eat straw like the ox."
FUTURE PERFECT TENSE. [SECOND FrUTURE.]
The Future Perfect tense represents an action or
state as perfect or finished at some future time; as,
"I shall have dined at one o'clock;" "I will go before I shcall have seen him."
Note.-In the second example, the future time to which shall have seen
belongs, is not the same as that to whichl will go refers; the mneaning is, "I
will go betfore the timne at whichl I shall have seen him;" at which (time) denoting the fiture time to which shall have seen refers.

REMARKS ON THE TENSES IN THE DIFFERENT MOODS.
1. The indicative has six tenses.
2. The subjunctive, being nothing more than the indicative or potential
after certain conjunctions, has also six tenses.
3. In conditions or suppositions, the past form sometimes refers to present
time; as, "If I had a pen now, I would write."' In this sense the verb implies that the thing supposed does not exist. "I wish that I had wings,"
implies that I have no wings; "He walks as if he carried a mountain," implies that he does nlot carry a mountain. "If I have a pen," leaves it uncertain whether I have a pen or not.
4. The past perfect is used in the same way in reference to past time; as,
"If I had seen him yesterday, I would have spoken to him." Here, had seen
does not refer to an action completed yesterday, but merely expresses a supposition with reference to past time.
5. The verb to be has, in the singular number, a separate form in expressions of this kind, when reference is made to present time; thus, "If I
were, if thou wert, if he were," instead of "If I was, if thou wast, if he was."*
The plural has no separate form.
6. Were is often used instead of would be, or should be, and had, when employed as an auxiliary, instead of would have, or should have; as, "The city
were ruined by such a course;" "James's fortitude had been laudable, had he
persisted in his first inltention."
7. The past tense of other verbs is sometimes, though not often, used in
the same way as were; as,' Such a policy, while it gladdened the hearts of
the poor, would in ten years cause a greater advance in the wealth," etc.Princeton Review. Here gladdened is used instead of would gladden.
8. The potential has fbur tenses, which are usually called the present, the
perfect, [present perfect,] the irmperfect, [past,] and the plaupefect, [past
perfect.]

written.
PAST.-I might write, I could write, I would write, I should write.
PAST PERFECT.-I mzight have written, I could have written, I saould have

9. The present denotes present permission, ability, necessity, or possibility.
Thus, "Yout may write" denotes that you have present permission to write;
"I can write," that I have present ability to write; "I mut write," that I am
under present necessity of writing. "I may write," sometimes expresses
present possibility; as, "I may write to-morrow, but I have not determined."
May is sometimes used in expressing a wish; as, "May you be happy."
Note.-It is the ability, permission, necessity, or possibility that is present;
the act of writing itself is future, if any particular time is referred to' These
forms are easily understood, if may, can, and must are considered as in the
present indicative, and write as in the injinitive.
10. fay have written, etc., are the present indicative may, etc., and the perfect inlfinitive to have written. "I may have written," means, "It is possible
that I wrote."
11. Might, could, would, and should were originally the past tenses of may,
can, will, and shall; could, would, and might are still sometimes used simply
as past tenses; as, " I could write yesterday;" that is, was able; "Though
I enldeavored to dissuade him, he would go;" that is, was determined; "She
would go out in the morning to gather flowers;" that is, was accustomed;
"Often might she be seen returning in the evening;" that is, it was possible
to see her, etc. Should is not now used in this way.
12. These words are generally used to express a condition or an affirmation
depending on a condition, and refer to present time, or are indefinite with
regard to time; as, "I could write now, if you would permit me."
13. They are often employed like the past tense of other verbs, to express
a supposition referring to present time, and implying that the thing supposed does not exist; as, "If he would remain a few days, I would accompany him;" that is, if he were willing.
14. Should often expresses present obligation, duty, etc.; as, "You should
be industrious."
15. These words are often used to express a softened assertion; as, "I
could wish a change to be made;"' "I should be inclined to doubt his candor."
In this sense they refer to present time.
16. The formf assigned to the past perfect (pluyVesfect) are composed of
mnight, could, would, or should, and the perfect infinitive. They seem to be

gations and negations; as, " Can he have done this?" "He cannot have done this."

allied to the past perfect inform, since they are composed of a past form and
the perfect ir?finitive, (though not the perfect participe;) yet they never
have the meaning of this tenlse-they never denote an action completed at
some past time referred to. In meaning, this is simply a' past (impe:fect)
tense. Thus, referring to present time, we say, " I would write to-day, if I
had a pen;" that is, I am willing to write. Referring to past time we say,
"I would have written yesterday, if I had had a pen;" that is, I was willing
to write. Might, couild, etc., are not usedcl in a past sense, but they are considered as the present time of verbs which have no past form; and they are
made to refer to past time by changing the form of the verb with which they
are connected.  "I would have written," is used instead of; "I woulded
write;" " I should have written," instead of; "I shoulded write."'
17. This point mnay be illustrated by a comparison with the manner of
using the verb ought. This verb was originally the past tense of owed; thus,
"You ought (owed) him a thousand pound."-Shakspeare. It is nlow used
in a present sense, and has no past form. When we wish to express a past
duty or obligation, we make a change in the verb with which it is connected.
Thus, "You ought to write to-day;" that is, you are under obligation to
write; "You ought to have written yesterday;" that is, you were under
obligation to write. The perfect infinitive is employed here, not in its usual
sense, but merely to give a past meaning to ought.
18. The imnperative has but one tense, which is called the present. This
term has reference to the time in which the command is given; the action is
of course always to be performed after the time of speaking.
19. The isfinitive has two tenses, which are called the i/npeifect, or resent,
and the perfect.
20. The imperfect, or present, denotes an action or state not completed at
the timne referred to by the verb with which it is connected. It may be
joined with any tense of the verb; as, "I wish to write;" "I wished to
write;" "I shall wish to write."
21. The perfect denotes an action as completed in reference to the time of
the verb with which it is connected; as, " He is said to have written;"
"He was said to have written;" " He will be said to have written."
22. These forms refer only to the continuance or conpletion of the action;
imperfect and perfect are the appropriate names. See " Participles."
NUIJMBER      A ND     PERSON.
The number and person of the verb are the
forms appropriated to the different numbers and
persons of the subject.
What are the number and person of verbs?NUMBER AND PERSON.                             77
Thus, in the present tense with the first person singular we
use love, with the second lovest, and with the third loves; as,
"I love, thou lovest, he loves."
Remarks.-1. Some languages have a peculiar form for every personl in
both numbers; but in English there are not so many separate forms. The
second person singular has a form appropriated to itself in all the tenses, ald
the third person sinlgular has a distinct form of the verb in the jpresent tense
-the present of the verb to have retaining this form when used as an auxiliary in the present perfect. There is no other change in regular verbs on account of the number and person of the subject.
2. The three persons in the plural are always alike, and, with the exception of the verb to be, the same as the first person singular.
3. The imperative mood has usually only the second person.
4. In some languages this mood has the first person plural, and the third
person in both numbers. In the English language also these persons are
sometimes used; as in the following examples:"He that hath eeris of herynge, here he."- Wiclif, Mcatt. xi.
"Geve he to her a lybel."-Id. zf~att. v.
"Send 7he his vassal train-himself advance,
Hel;e will I take my stand-decide our swords the chance."
-IYsnt's Tasso.
Confde we in ourselves alone;" "With.virtue be we armed;" " Cullt we
the rose;" "Do we what duty bids."-Id.
"Fall he that must beneath his rival's arm,
And live the rest, secure from fature harm."-Pope.
" Laugh those that can, weep those that may."-Scott.
"' And rest we here,' Matilda said."-lb.
"My soul, tutrn from them-t-rns we to survey."--Goldssnith.
"Commnence we now that higher state,
Now do thy will as angels do."-l~ontgomery.
5. The usual mode of exprcssing the same idea is by using the infinitive
mood, with the second person imperative of the verb let, and the objective
case of the noun or pronounl; as, " Let him hear;" "Let us confide."  Let
is often used in this way, even when there is nlo command addressed to any
one; as, "Let there be light."
6. The verb in such expressions as, "Hallowed be thy name," "Thy
kingdom come," " Be it enacted," "Be it so," "So help me God," "So do
God to Abner," etc., should be considered as belonging to the third person
of the imperative.
7. The infinite, as it has no subject, has no number and person.78
PARTICIPLES.
PARTICIPLES.
A participle is a word which expresses an action
or state, like a verb, and belongs to a noun like an
adjective.
It is so called because itparticipates the properties of both a verb and an
adjective.
A participle, like a verb, denotes an action or state, and, like a verb, is
tlansitive or intransitive, and when transitive is utsed in the active and passive voices; but it cannot be so used as to express an affirmation. Like an
adjective, it belongs to a noun; as, "I see a man catting wood."  Here, cutting denotes an action, is in the active voice, and has an object like a transitive verb; it belongs to the noun man, like an adjective.*
Note.-The participle is no more entitled to be considered a distinct part
of speech, than the infinitive mood is. They are both paerticiples in the etymological sense of the term; the one participating in the properties of an
adjective and a verb, the other of a noun and a verb.
CLASSES OF PARTICIPLES.
The participle has three forms in the active
voice, and three in the passive.
Each voice has the Imperfect and the Perfect
participle. The active voice has also the Auxiliary
Perfect participle, and the passive voice has the
Passive participle.

* Participles are intermediate between verbs and adjectives, as zoophytes are
between animals and vegetables. Lord Bacon gives the name p)ar?ticiple to those productions which seem to form a connecting link between the animal and vegetable
kingdoms. "The pacrticiples or confiners between plants and living creatures are
such chiefly as are fixed, and have no local motion of remove, though they have a
motion in their parts. * * * There is a fabulous narration, that in the norithern
countries there should be an herb that groweth in the likeness of a lamb, and feedleth
upon the grass in such sort as it will bare the grass round about."-Natural History,
page 609.79
CLASSES OF PARTICIPLES.
of the action or state; as, " John is cutting wood;"' Being loved by all, Alice is happy."
The Perjfect participle denotes the comnpletion of
the  action   or state; as, "Having cut the wood, he
is making     a  fire;" " The wood       having been cut, he
will make a fire."
In the example, "John is cutting wood," the action is represented as imperfect, or continuing; in "Having cut the wood,"
the action is represented as perfect, or completed.
The Passive      participle merely      denotes     that the
object to whose name         it belongs is acted upon; as,
" The wood was cut;" " Mary is loved."
The Auxiliary Perfect participle is used to aid in
forming    the   perfect tenses; as, " I         have    loved;"
"The wood has been cut."
The passive participle and the auxiliary perfect participle are
always alike in form.
IRemarks.-1. The imperfect participle is usually called the present, but
may denote either a present, a past, or a future actlon; as, "I am writing, I was
writing, I shall be writing."  The action is present only in relation to the
time of the verb with which it is connected.
2. As the imperfect participle denotes an action coelntning or incomplete,
so the pe?fect participle denotes an action completed at the time referred to by
the principal verb. It may, like the imperfect participle, denote either a
present, a past, or a future action, but it always represents the action as perfect or completedl at the time referred to; as, " aving cut the wood, he made
a fire yesterday;" " IHaving cut the wood, he is now making a fire;" "H aving cut the wood to-morrow, he will make a fire."
3. That eminent grammarian, Goold Brown, calls this the pluberfect participle, "not because this compound is really of the pluperfect tense, but
because it always denlotes being, action, or passion, that is, or was, or will be
completed before the doing or being of something else; and, of course, when
the latter thing is represented as past, the participle must correspond to the
What does the perlfect participle imply?  What is this participle called when used
What other participles have transitive  to aid in forming the perfect tenses of
verbs?                            the active voice?
What does the passive participle imply,80                   CLASSES OF PARTICIPLES.
pluperfect tense of its verb; as,' HUaving explained her views, it was necessary she should expatiate on the vanity and futility of the enjoyments promised by pleasure.'-Jamieson's Rhetoric, p. 181. H-ere, having explained is
equivalent to when she had explained.'"-Institutes of English Grammar, p. 83.
Plype7yfet does not mean completed before; it is a technical lame of a particular tense, and if it is applied to a participle, it should be because the
participle resembles the tense in some respect. When past time is referred
to, it does resemble the pluperfect tense; but when present time is referred
to, it resembles the perfect tense; and if the time is,future, it resembles the
second fubsu'e tense. If the time referred to in the example quoted by Mr.
Brown, were present, having explained would be equivalent to when she has
explained; and if the time were future, the same participle would be equivalent to when she shall have explained. It would be as correct to call this the
second future participle as the pluperfect.
The nature of this participle may be easily learned by observing to what
tenses it is equivalent; these are the  resent peifect, the past perfect, and the
future perfect. The participle, then, belongs to no particular division of
time, and simply denotes action perfect, that is, completed at any time.
4. The passive participle is usually called the perfect participle. "It is
manifest," says Mr. Brown, " that the perfect participle of the verb to love,
whether active or passive, is the simple word loved, and not this compoulnd
[having loved."]  In this we think he is mistaken. If we wish to express,
by a participle, an action completed at any time, we use the compound form,
and this is the perfect participle. The characteristic of the participle in ed
is, that it implies the reception. of an action; as, "Csesar was killed by Brutus."  In this sentence Caesar is represented as acted upon by Brutus. WTas
does not express this idea-it makes the affirmation, and points to the time,
but"k illed is the word which denotes the reception of the action.* It doeN
not denote an action perfect, or completed, at the time to which was refers,
"Mary lives loving all, and loved by all."  In this senltence loved certainly
does not denote an action "done and completed;" it merely implies that th6
person to whose name it belongs is acted upon. "She is loved by all," is
nothing more than "All love her" expressed in a passive form. This participle is the word whichforms the passive voice-gives it its peculiar mode of
signification.
The use of this participle in the perfect tenses of the active voice should
not be taken into consideration in giving it a name or a definition. We
* "Brutus killed Csesar," expresses, in the active form, what "Camsar was killed by
Brutus," does in the passive. Some logicians, in analyzing killed, would say, that it
contained the copula wa,s, and the predicate killivg; incorrectly, however, for killing
denotes the continuance of the action. Neither killing nor having killed would answer; a third participle would be necessary to denote the action without reference to
the continuance or the completion. This participle wvould be the simple active
participle, and would have the same relation to the active form that killed has to the
passive. The active form expresses the copula and predicate by one word, so that
there is no need of this third participle in the active voice. What that third partici.
ple would be to the active, the passive participle is to the passive.CONJUGATION.                              81
might, with as much propriety, take into view the use of the verb to have as
an auxiliary, when defining it as a principal verb. When a word entirely
changes its application, it becomes in effect a different word. Words are
classified according to their signification, and not according to form. It is
probable that this participle was originally a passive participle; but so far
from being a passive participle nlow, it is used in intransitive verbs, which
have no passive voice. See Remarks on the Auxiliary Verbs, p. 105.
In the sentence, "I have built a house of stone," built has an active signification, and is the auxiliary pefect participle; while in the sentence, "I have
a house built of stone," it has a passive meaninlg, and forms the passive participle.
The passive participle of certain verbs sometimes denotes completed action;
as, "The house is emptied;" "The house is built;" "The letter is written."
As far as the completion of the action is concerned,." The house is built," is
equivalent to "The house has beenl built;" but the former sentence denotes
an e.xisting state, rather thanl a completed action. The name of the agent
cannot be expressed in phrases of this kind. We cannot say, "The house
is built by John." When we say, " The house is built by mechanics," we
do not express an existing state.
5. The imperfect participle is sometimes improperly used for the perfect;
as, "Saying [having said] this, he departed;" " This being said, [having
been said,] he departed."
6. Participles are sometimes used as nouns; as, "Playizn is pleasant;"
"He spends too much time in playing."   Participles, when used as nouns,
may be called participial nouns. These participial nouns, in their use, resemble the infinitive more than they do the participle in its adjective sense.*
CON?JUGATION~.
The conjugation of a verb is the regular arrangement of its parts, according to the voices, moods,
tenses, numbers, and persons.
The only regular terminations added to verbs are est, s, ed,
edst, and ing. Thus:

the same in sound and spelling as the participle present, from which, however, it
should be carefutlly distinlguished: e. g.' rising early is healthful,' and' it is healthful
to rise early,' are equivalent." "Grammarians have produced much needless perplexity in speaking of the participle in'ing' being employed so and so; when it is
manifest that that very emnploymnent of the word constitutes it, to all intents and purposes, an n,finitive, and not a participle. The advantage of the infinitive in ing, is,
that it may be used in the nominative or in any oblique case."-Archbishop  tlhatelVy;

SINCE the publication of the first edition, this work has been carefully revised, and many corrections and improvements have been
made.   The Author would direct attention, particularly to the
"PARSING EXERCISES, at the end of the book. These consist principally of selections from the best writers in the language; and they
are regularly arranged according to the rules and remarks in the
Syntax. Thus every principle is illustrated by quotations from the
best authorities. The Author has attempted to remove difficulties
by notes at the bottom of the page.
In the first edition an apology was made for giving new names
to the tenses. But these names find so much favor with the best
grammarians, that no apology is needed.
The Author would direct attention to his mode of treating Adjectives, Pronouns, Verbs, Prepositions, and Adverbs, in the Etymology;
and to the Syntax. The rules for the Analysis of Sentences have
been taken, with some changes, from Andrews and Stoddard's Latin
Grammar..0--

The additional "Parsing Exercises" on the 216th and following

corresponding exercises in the body of the work.  Thus, if the
teacher should find that any class has not become sufficiently acquainted with the noun by parsing the exercises on p. 33, he may
turn to p. 216, where will be found additional exercises of the same

Remark.-Certain intransitive verbs have sometimes the form of the passive voice, withlout being passive in sense; as, "He is gone;" "The Lord
is risen indeed."  These do not admit after them the name of the agent with
the preposition by, as transitive verbs in the passive voice do.
92CONJUGATION.

Thus, we may say, "He is loved by John;" but not, "He is gone by
John."  "He has risen," and "He is risen," both represent the subject as
performing the action.
