IN the following pages I have attempted to explain
in simple language, and by familiar illustrations ﬁtted
for the comprehension of boys and girls, the meaning
and limits of liberty, law, government, and human
rights; and thus to make intelligible to them the polit-
ical principles on which our system of government in
the United States is founded.

The book grew out of an attempt, in a few letters, to
instruct my oldest son in the political knowledge which
every American boy ought to possess to ﬁt him for the
duties of citizenship. I found my subject much larger
than I at ﬁrst imagined; but interest in the attempt led
me on, and what was begun originally for one boy is
here printed for the use of others. I have retained the

familiar and direct style which one naturally uses in

addressing a boy, because thus I hope more easily to in-

terest young people in the subject.

I believe that free government is a political applica-
tion of the Christian theory of life; that at the base of
the republican system lies the Golden Rule; and that

to be a good citizen of the United States one ought to
be imbued with the spirit of Christianity, and to believe
in and act upon the teachings of Jesus. He condemned
self-seeking, covetousness, hypocrisy, class distinctions,
envy, malice, undue and ignoble ambition; and he in-
culcated self-restraint, repression of the lower and
meaner passions, love to the neighbor, contentment,
gentleness-",'regard for the rights and-happiness of oth-
ers, and respect for the law. o .

It seems l30'1I1G that the vices he condemned are those
also which are dangerous to the perpetuity of repub-
lican government; and that the principles he inculcated
may be properly used as tests of the merits of a political
system or a public policy. In this spirit I have Written,
believing that thus “government of the people, by the
people, and for the people,” can be most clearly justi-
ﬁed and explained.

WALTER NORDHOFF:

MY DEAR BOY,

, You are now sixteen; in ﬁve years you
will have the right and duty to vote not only for (or
against) persons, but also upon measures of public pol-
icy; I should like you to vote and perform the other
duties of citizenship intelligently, and not i-gnogriantly;
and to do this it is necessary that you shall understand
something of the principles upon which our government
was established, and -upon Which, of course, it ought to
be conducted. This is the more necessary, because, if
you are right, you Will sometimes be in the minority,
and when the right cause is ‘in the minority, it is of
great importance that its adherents shall be able to give
pertinent and convincing reasons for their course: for

thus only can a minority hope to become a majority;

In a free state every great political struggle is a- contest
of principles; and you have only to read such a book
as the Debates between Lincoln and Douglas to see of
What extreme importance to freedom and constitutional

government is the ability to comprehend for yo_,;1rseilf,

and to expose clearly to others, the zfundamental princi-
ples of free government.
Moreover, you must understand that to the citizen of

a frcestate, politics concern themselves in the largest

sense with the liberty and the prosperity of the people,

yyvhich are sure to be affected by bad laws——and bad

laws are often adopted Witl1 the best motives, and urged
and supported by men Who are as truly patriotic and
benevolent as they are ignorant.

It is one of the great ‘merits of our political system in
the United States that, though it appears at ﬁrst view
complicated, it is in fact suﬁiciently simple to be under-
stood by all the citizens. In What follows I mean to ex-
plain to you the general principles on Which free gov-
ernment rests, and the manner in which those principles
are applied in our own country; and I shall try to do
this in such a Way that, with a little attention and study,
you Will, I hope, be able to understand all that is need-
ful. I

At the foundation of all government is SOCIETY, and
of this I must first tell you something.

IO
OF soomrrz

1. God does not appear to have created men by chance,
for we ﬁnd all mankind to possess certain qualities, faculties,
and desires, which move and rule them, whether they are sav-
ages or call themselves civilized, and whether they are black,
brown, yellow, or white. , »

2. One of. the principal and most important qualities of
mankind is gregariousness. This means that men have a
propensity to gather in ﬂocks or herds; a propensity also
of many animals, as sheep, cattle, horses, blackbirds, elephants,
and some monkeys. This desire for the society of their kind
leads animals to go in droves—as the buffaloes upon the plains;
and it collects savage men into tribes, and civilized men into na-
tions, which are only larger and more highly organized tribes.

3. But as man has received from God qualities, faculties,
and desires which the beasts have not, men are able to do
something more than herd together; and the rudest tribe of
savages has laws or rules for the conduct ofits members
which the most highly developed society of apes or black-
birds or elephants of which we know is without.

4. Animals have, 1, desire to live; 2, desire for sufﬁcient
food; 3, desire to propagate their kind and to protect their
young; and, 4, desire to avoid pain, and to live, therefore, in
the circumstances for which their nature best ﬁts them: in
other words, to be comfortable. VVhen you see more of men,
you will discover that some men are very much like animals,
and have no aspirations or desires which can not properly be
ranged under the above heads. Such a man I do not Want
you to be.

5. Besides the desires which we have in common with

12 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

beasts, and which are necessary to us in order to preserve
our species from extinction, God has given men other desires,

and faculties which, if they wish, they may use for their ful-

ﬁllment. These higher qualities of our lives are not needed
for the mere preservation of life. Some of those which by
general consent are regarded as the highest, lead inevitably to
the lessening of many of our pleasures, and not unfrequently

to the surrender of an individual’s comfort, happiness, and

even life, to increase, as he may believe, the welfare of his
felloW—men. Looking at these higher motives, desires, and
aspirations, and at the degree in which they interfere with
the happiness or comfort of the body alone, it is reasonable
to believe, what Jesus taught, that men have something im-
mortal, destined to live on after the body perishes, and capable,
after its release from the body, of still greater development
and higher enjoyments. This something We call the Soul.

6. Take notice that the soul of man should not obey the
law of living, but the law of duty. For instance, of all the
friends of your father and mother who served in the late
great War, there was not one who, if he had obeyed the mere
law of living—the animal instinct of self—preservation—-would
not have remained at home, and pursued his usual calling, in
comfort, with his family about him, and his Wealth increasing.
Instead of that they abandoned their professions, broke up
the careers they had planned for themselves, left their fam-
ilies and their comfortable homes, and undertook to face hard-
ships to which they Were unaccustomed, and not a few died
on the ﬁeld of ‘battle, They did and suffered thus, not to
beneﬁt themselves, or to gratify any of the desires or passions
which men have in common with the beasts, but in the hope
of helping to maintain a formof government which they be-
lieved to be pre-eminently calculated to elevate ‘mankind, and
increase the happiness of their fellows. A buffalo would be

' incapable of such motives: if he fought, it would be from

greed for food, from a desire for a more comfortable lodg-
ment, out of jealousy, or in self-defense, supplemented event-
ually by rage. y

or, SOCIETY." ' 13

7. A creature believing himself to possess an immortal part,
or soul, destined to survive the body, would reasonably seek to
prepare this immortal part for the conditions under which it
is to exist. And as the future life is, as We are taught, to be
lived Without the help of the body, it is evident that training
the soul or spirit consists in increasing by cultivation our ca-
pacity for those enjoyments which do not depend upon the
body. To curb the body, therefore, and keep it under con-
trol, to restrain the lower passions—those which We have in

common with beasts—and to Weed out of ourselves envy,,

greed, spite, covetousness, jealousy, hypocrisy, ill—temper—-all
tending to disregard for the rights of others—Would appear,
aside from the commands and instructions of religion, to be
the reasonable. and prudent course of every man who believes
himself to have an immortal part, or soul.

8. But God has so made the world, and so formed man-
kind" that they naturally and inevitably respect and esteem
most highly those who most consistently act upon this theory
of life. The whole World is combined to honor ‘Washington;
and it is equally unanimous in execrating a merely vulgar and
selﬁsh trader or politician.

9. N ow I Wish you to remember, as a FUNDAMENTAL ‘TRUTH
IN AMERICAN POLITICS, that the course of life which is thus
calculated to ﬁt your immortal part for the future and spirit-
ual life is also‘that course which will make you a good citizen
of the United States. -

10. To be a good citizen means not merely that you shall
give such prudent obedience to the laws as would keep you
out of jail. It means that you shall in all parts of your life
live moderately and ‘virtuously; that you shall “love your
neighbor as yourself,” and therefore do him no wrong; that
you shall pursue your aims in life With such moderation as
to avoid interfering with the happiness of others; that you
shall endeavor by your actions, Whenever occasion serves, to
beneﬁt your fellow—men: for selﬁshness breeds selﬁshness,
covetousness corrupts those who behold it, and liberty can
only be maintained among a people who practice s.elf—sacri—

ﬁce, and to whom a virtuous life seems more important than
mere selﬁsh success.

11. To be a good man is your ﬁrst duty as an American;
but you ought also, if possible, to be a wise citizen, and to
that end you should understand what are the proper powers

and the proper limitations of government; what can not as

well as what can be done by law. For some of the most
foolish and injurious laws on our statute—books have been
enactedby good men with a sincere desire to increase the
happiness of their fellow-beings. We come then, next, to
the consideration of Liberty and the Province of Law.

11.
OF ‘LIBERTY, AND THE’ PRO VINCE OFLA W.

12. You enjoy liberty when you may say and do whatever
pleases you anddoes not injure other persons. If every human
being were endowed with infallible judgment as to the eﬁect
of his acts on others, and strength of purpose to avoid every

thing that could injure his fellow-men, laws would be needless. ’

13. But as the judgment of men is fallible and their strength
varies, and as all men do not think alike, it has been found
necessary in almost all societies, however rudely organized, to
declare what shall be held injurious; and not only this, but
to declare penalties for such injurious acts. Bear in mind,
however, that political laws can cover only a part and not the
whole duty of man; and that there is no lower or meaner
rogue than he who studies the law merely to keep out of its
clutches. r -

14. The Congress which sat from December, 187 3, to June
23, 187 4, enacted ﬁve hundred and ﬁfty new laws, of which
two hundred and thirty-six were general laws, and three hun-
dred and fourteen private laws. Many of our state legisla-
tures are quite as industrious as Congress; and the multipli~
cation of laws has become a curse to the country, and has a

or LIBERTY.—-OF GOVERNMENTS. 15

tendency to bringinto contempt, not only the laws, but those
who make them.

15. Considering the propensity of men to multiply laws,
and, often with good intentions, to legislate upon subjects
which do not come properly within the limits of law, it is
proper to tell you that: Laws should be few in number and
simple in structure; they should rigidly avoid granting special
privileges or immunities to individuals, but should be general
in their application; and they ought never to interfere with
the liberty of men to move about peaceably from place to
place; to discuss freely public affairs and questions; to en-
gage in whatever honest occupation pleases them; to pro-
duce whatever seems to them most suitable ; and to exchange
what they have produced where. they please, and for what
they most desire. These limitations of the law-making power
no doubt seem to you so simple and so evidently just that
you will wonder they need to be speciﬁed; but in fact there
is in every legislative body a constant propensity to overstep
these limits——a tendency which the united efforts of all the
wisest men in any state or in the whole country can not en-
tirely resist. It was noticed by an eminent English writer
that almost all modern reforms in Europe have been made,
not by enacting new laws, but by repealing a great mass of
old ones.

III.
OF GOVERNMENTS.  

16. Governments may be said to be necessary evils, their
necessity arising out of the selﬁshness and stupidity of man-
kind. ’

17. They are of different kinds: Despotisms, where the
will of one man is the law; oligarchies, where a few make
the laws for those subordinate to them; and free or popular
governments, where the laws are made by the people, or
rather by. persons they select for that purpose.

16 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

18_. In reading history, you will discover that the less in-_
telligent and more selﬁsh a nation Was, the more despotic
was its government, and the more arbitrary and vexatious its
laws; and that as the general average of virtue and intelli-
gence in a nation increased, in the_same degree its govern-
ment and laws became milder and more just. It is equally
true that a nation which has enjoyed an excellent government
may, by the corruption of its morals, and the consequent
increase of selﬁshness and ignorance, lose this, and have im-
posed on it a Worse, and even the Worst form of government.
Thus I Wish you to believe that it is only by maintaining,
and even elevating, the standard of virtue and intelligence
among our people that We can preserve our free institutions.

19. Hence the importance that you should be a good citi-
zen, in the largest sense; for the example of each tells upon
all who surround him. If, when you become ‘a man, you
should be dishonest, unscrupulous, regardless of others’ rights,
covetous of Wealth or distinction to the injury of others, en-
vious, in’ any Way base, your course would help to demoralize
and debauch the unthinking and weak, which means the
larger part of those who surround you. This is the reason
Why the course of life of the notorious James Fisk was pe-
culiarly hateful to good citizens; his .own life they would
have troubled themselves little about, but the inﬂuence of his
career Was pernicious and degrading upon the whole country.
This is the reason, too, Why Napoleon III. drew on himself
in an especial manner the bitter dislike of thoughtful men
and women ; Why We abhor a political demagogue, a swindler
in oﬂice, or a merely ostentatious rich man: because their
bad example is contagious, infects the Weaker part of those
who see the spectacle, degrades public opinion, and makes
vice less odious, and virtue and self-restraint less important
in the general mind. .On the other hand, the example of
probity, of faithfulness to duty and to principle, in the low-
est citizen, is valuable and important because, it Wins general
respect, not merely for the man, but for those virtues of which
his life is an example.

PRIMARY EUNCTIONS or GOVERNMENT. 17

IV.

OF THE PRIMARY AND NECESSARY F UN 0 TI 0N8
OF G 0 VERNMEN T.

20. The primary and necessary functions of any govern-
ment are to maintain the peace and to administer justice,
which means to protect the orderly and law-abiding part of

the people in the enjoyment of life and property and against

the attacks of the _disorderly and law—breal:ing. Necessarily
it has also to ‘collect from the people, in the manner most
equal and least oppressive, the money needed to pay the of-
ﬁcers charged with these duties.

21. Where the average of virtue, intelligence, and sel£.~re-
straint is high among a people, their government needs to ‘in-
terfere but little in their affairs. Where this average is low,
government always interferes more, by means of police, armies,
and vexatious regulations. This arises from . the fact that
peace, order, and the security of life and property are re-
garded as the most precious and necessary possessions by

every people, and to secure these, men and nations are gen-

erally ready to give up a large measure of political liberty,
and to suﬁer many other and minor evils, such as high taxa-
tion. On this plea the French people Were induced to accept
Napoleon as the “savior of society,” and the common excuse
for a despotism is that it is ‘necessary to maintain order;
which nevertheless it does not maintain, except temporarily,
and at the monstrous cost of increasing the ignorance and
helplessness and diminishing the virtue and public spirit of
the nation, and thus in the end increasing tremendously the
causes of disorder. Napoleon III. held France by the throat
for eighteen years, and all the meaner sort of ‘mankind glori-
ﬁed him as the xvisest of rulers ; but eighteen years of liberty,
even with the greatest presumable amount of disorder, would

18 POLITICS. roan YOUNG AMERICANS.

not have left France as poor, debt-ridden, humiliated, and de«
1noralized as it is to-day.

22. In our own country, since the late war, the Federal
Government has been allowed to interfere in the local aﬁairs
of some of the states, whose citizens had not sufficient public

‘virtue and self-restraint to maintain order among themselves.

I wish you to believe that such forcible interference of the
Federal Government, except for special, temporary, and ex-
traordinary occasions, as to quell a sudden riot, is unwise and
dangerous : because it debases public spirit, and enervates the
orderly part of society, whose highest duty it is to rule and
to punish wrong—doers. It would be far Wiser to let a state,
or even half-a—dozen states, suffer from misgovernment until
the orderly part of their communities learned the necessity
of forming and maintaining a good administration. Cali-
fornia would to-day be in a chaotic condition had its early
settlers been taught to depend upon the Federal Government
for protection in their local concerns. But these, l1aving
borne violence and lawlessness as long as they could, and
ﬁnding no outside power at hand to" help them, at last took
affairs into their own hands——where such aﬁairs properly
belonged——hanged the worst criminals, banished others, and
formed a stable and very highly public-spirited‘ community,
which, while largely composed of the rudest elements, yet
developed, as the direct result of this experience, in a singu-
larly great degree the spirit of obedience to and respect for
law, which is the essence of what we call public spirit.

23. In like manner the city of New York was for many
years ruled at Albany, on the- plea that it was unsafe to allow
the citizens to take charge of their local affairs. But under
the Albany rule corruption and disorder constantly increased;
and it was left in the end for the people of the city to release
themselves by their own effort from the control of the Ring;
and they were actually able to do this, even after the corrup-
tionists had for years debauched public sentiment, and when

the Ring were at the height of their power, and believed _

themselves secure in its possession.

PRIMARY FUNCTIONS or GOVERNMENT. 19

24. It is only where the people have public spirit enough to
resent wrong, and to give vigorous and instant support to the

officers of justice, that governments can be efficient; and it is t

true that no government will be just, economical, or efficient
unless the general opinion of the people requires that it shall
be so. Rulers are only men; the possession of power easily
demoralizes the best and wisest of men; and no ruler will long
be just, efﬁcient, honest, or respectable, who does not feel and
fear the force of public indignation; nor will rogues fear the
laws, unless they are assured that the mass of citizens will vig-
orously‘ demand the prompt enforcement of the laws.

25. Thus the city of New York has long suffered from the
depredations of the criminal part of its population, because the

courts have too often been corrupt, and the administration of '

the law was lax. A murderer or highway robber, caught red-
handed, who was-allowed to lie in jail for a year before trial,

and to carry his case through all the courts on appeal, knew i 

that his offense would be forgotten before his punishment
came; and his fellow-criminals, seeing punishment long de-
layed and frequently evaded, were encouraged in their vicious
careers. Thus crime was fostered. But across the Hudson, in
New Jersey, the courts are more ‘rigorous; and the effect of
prompt justice-was shown, some years ago, in a case of bur-
glary. The burglars, New-Yorkers by residence, were caught;
the grand jury, which happened to be in session, found a true
bill against them; they were at once brought to trial; and in
eleven days after their burglary were sentenced to thirty years
in state prison-and safely lodged in the Trenton Prison, with

no hope of pardon. There was not a burglary for several years 

in the neighborhood.

26. Back of all laws and all authority must lie a belief that
in the last resort every citizen will defend his own rights.
You can not put a corporal’s guard at every man’s door. The
thief or robber at bottom never fears the law and the govern-
ment nearly as much as he does the right arm and courage of
the man he seeks to injure. This is shown wherever, in our
own country, any even inconsiderable body of citizens have

suffered themselves to be robbed, whether on the highway or by
rings of swindling politicians. When, on one occasion, three
masked robbers were able to plunder "ea railroad train full of
unresisting passengers in Missouri, other highway robberies
were presently reported from the same region. The despera-
does were encouraged in their careers by the quiet submission
of their victims. They did not greatlyfear the law; and a
single shot from a brave citizen would have checked them more
immediately than the whole power of the government unsup-
ported by the citizens. In Montana, in the early days of its

‘settlement, the territory for a time lay subject to a powerful

robber band, whose members had the audacity even to ride
into shops in Helena, in open day, on horseback, and demand
tribute from the shopkeepers. They had no dread of police
or troops, because the people suﬁ.’ered- their exactions without
resistance. But one day a courageous shopkeeper shot dead
the robber who rode into his store—and that single act, arous-
ing the citizens, caused the speedy extirpation of the robbers.-

27. Immediately after the late war the newly emancipated
negroes were threatened with various aggressions from the in-
tolerant and ignorant part of the Southern whites; and hav-
ing been long slaves, they did not at ﬁrst assert their rights.
Attempts were made by the United States Government to de-
fend them; but this was soon seen to be impossible; and had
they not presently learned to defend themselves, society must
have perished in those states, in spite of the efforts of one of
the most powerful governments in the world, and of a whole
bookful of laws and penalties enacted by Congress. Fortu-
nately for the country, the negroes soon learned their duty in
this respect. Indeed, they presently became aggressive; and
wherever it is understood that they have the courage to strike
back, their persecutions have ceased. _ _ _

28. It is only Where the mass of the people resent the viola-

tion of law and order, and are prompt in coming to the help A

of the officers to enforce the laws and put down wrong—doers,
that free government is secure. Where the people are care-
less, and submit readily to wrong, the law soon falls into dis-

repute, rights are invaded, and disorders are encouraged. Hence
in a free community the citizens can not delegate to police or
other law officers the whole duty of maintaining peace and or-
der; they must hold themselves ready at all times to assist by
their countenance, and if need be by their personal efforts, the
oflicers whom they have charged with the execution of the
laws. This does not imply the obligation or the right of citi-
zens to take the law into their own hands; but that they must

‘ promptly insist -on the proper officers doing their duty, and if

need be help them, acting under their authority.

V.
OF SOME OTHER F UN 0 TI ONE OF G 0 VERNMEN T.

29. The primary and necessary functions of government are,
as I told you in the last section, to maintain the peace and exe-
cute justice between the different members of society.

30. Under this‘ head come the army, navy, police, and the
conduct of oﬁicial intercourse With foreign nations, and in our
country with Indian tribes—Whom we have always treated as
foreign nations, by which course We have retarded their ad-
vance into civilization, and caused endless Indian Wars and
constant corruption.

31. But all civilized governments are charged with yet other

‘ duties, which, it has been found, they can perform, if not in a

better yet in a more uniform and convenient "manner than
private citizens, and which are also incidentally of political
importance. These duties are: to conduct the post—office—
by which intercourse by letters, and the dissemination of
printed information, is made uniformly easy and cheap all
over the country; the public or free education of youth; the
maintenance of a light—house system; the protection and im-
provement of harbors; a large body of scientiﬁc observations
which require to be conducted systematically during a great
number of years in order to be valuable; the survey of lands,

and the recording of deeds, which are the tokens of owner
ship in land; the care of the public health, and the prevention
or abolition of nuisances, and quarantine or the means to keep

a out infectious diseases; the care of roads and bridges; and
some others. *

32. Some of these matters we leave to the Federal Govern-
ment; others are assigned to the states; and others yet are
deputed by these to the city and county governments.

33. I wish you to remember that private enterprise would
probably perform all these offices as well, and many better
than the government. For example, in California and Nevada,
Wells-Fa1‘go’s express has for many years carried letters, be-
cause the public there believed that it would convey them more
rapidly and securely than -the post—ofﬁce, and was willing to pay
an extra rate for the security. But over the whole country it
is doubtful if the mails would be delivered with the same gen-
eral uniformity of speed and regularity and cheapness by pri-
Vate persons as by the government; and this is the legitimate
excuse for the existence of the post-oﬂice.

34. Because we assign to the government some duties, there-
fore, which private citizens could and often would perform in
a better manner than the government, this does not prove that
the government ought to extend such operations and intrude
into the great ﬁeld of private enterprise. And yet, you must
know, there is a constant tendency toward such extension.
Thus it is maintained by some persons that the government
Ought to become a carrier of parcels, and thus assume the
functions of an express company. Others wish it to take pos-
session of the telegraph lines; yet others imagine that it ought
to own and manage the railroads. Various reasons lead men
to these notions——such as impatience under delays or incon-
veniences; disappointed business rivalries; hopes of gain by
selling out at a large price to the government; a liking for
grand operations, such as the government alone can carry on;
and a vague and ignorant belief that the government can really
transact business better than private persons.

35. I give you below the main reasons why a government

OTHER FUNCTIONS or GOVERNMENT. 28

should be strictly conﬁned to its proper functions, and why we
should oppose all attempts to impose upon it other duties
which lie outside of these: 1st. It would have to -increase very
greatly its staff of servants, which increases the patronage,
which means the power of bribery, possessed by the rulers;
and their means of corrupting the people, and thus encroach-
ing upon our liberties. 2dly. It would greatly increase the
amount of money to be handled by the government, and thus
make the possession of power tempting to bad men, which is
another means toward the corruption of the people. 3dly. It
would make the people dependent, and deprive them of incen-
tives to ingenuity and enterprise, and lead them to look to
some power outside of themselves for the management of their
daily lives. All these are serious evils; and if we had to choose,
it would be far wiser to turn the post-office, roads, light-houses,
the public education, and all other matters of that kind over
to private enterprise, than to allow the government to assume
still other functions, such as telegraphing and carrying express
parcels, or managing the railroads. . «
36. It is of the utmost importance to the perpetuity of free
government that the people should be left to do for themselves

, whatever they can, without the interference of the government.

Free government is not, at any given time, the most convenient,
as I shall show you further on; but it has this transcendent
merit, that under it alone can abuses be cured without revolu-
tion or the disorganization of society. For instance, the peo-
ple are just now agitated about the abuse of power by rail-
roads. We shall remedy this class of evils, slowly no doubt,
but surely, and without revolution; but in a despotic govern-
ment the railroad question would perhaps upset the govern-
ment; and it would at any rate become mixed up with the
question of the existence of the government itself. We in the
United States may not, at any time, have all the physical con-
veniences which we might have for a while if the government
did every thing for us; but we have the means of peaceful
progress; the certainty that we_ shall slowly but surely solve
all the difficulties which press upon all civilized nations alike;

24 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

and solve then1 without revolution—which means, without per-
manent injury to society.

VI.

0E THE UsEEUL2vEss AND THE’ INOONVENIENOE
0E EEEE G 0 VERNMENT.

37. V\7hat we call a free government, one in which the peo-
ple rule, and in which much is left to the people, l1as there-
fore this extremely important advantage, that it forces them
to be self-helpful; and obtains peaceful progress, not by the
costly and after all ineffective interference of the government,
but by the only permanent means, the determination of the
people themselves. Thus government “ of the people, for the
people, and by the people,” educates a nation in courage, en-
terprise, a strong sense of duty, self-restraint, the habit of obey-
ing law, and the capacity and readiness to act together for pub-
he ends. Free government is a school of all the manly virtues.

38. It works also another and equally important result: It
maintains peace amid change, and allows the reform of evils
without resort to revolution; because where the whole people
take part in electing their rulers and law—makers, all feel equally
bound by the laws at any timeienacted, and if any feel these
laws oppressive, they get patience from the knowledge that
open discussion will_ in time bring its remedies. Under a des-
potic government wrongs can be righted only by violence and
revolution. Under a free government like ours, all wrongs can
be righted by argument. Hence the freest government is like-
ly to be the most peaceable, orderly, and permanent.

39. Our own history, compared with the history of other
nations, proves this to be true. We enjoyed unbroken peace
at home for more than seventy-ﬁve years, from the acknowl-
edgment of our independence to the year 1861, and in that
time were engaged in but two insigniﬁcant foreign wars.

40. Moreo_ver, the war of the rebellion could never have hap-

USEFULNESS OF FREE GOVERNMENT. 25

pened had tl1e whole people of the Southern States been al-
lowed to vote for or against secession and rebellion—had free

i government existed, that is to say, in those states. For that

_part of the people who were then slaves would have voted
unanimously against secession; and with free and fair discus-
sion—'—such as would have been had the negroes strengthened
the Union vote—no state would have cast a majority for se-
cession, least of all South Carolina, a majority of whose peo-
ple were blacks.

41. Free governmentis troublesome to its citizens, because
it imposes upon every man duties of a public nature, to which
he must give time and intelligent thought. In the measure
that all the people thus give up time and thought to their po-
litical duties, in the same degree will their government be just-
ly and honestly administered. Gross selﬁshness, such as leads
men to abandon their political and public duties, in order to
devote their Whole time and energies to their own affairs or
pleasures, is therefore, as I have already several times pointed
out to you, a disgraceful and dangerous vice in the citizen of
a republic.

42. A despotism, like that from which France so long suf-
fered, is easily endurable to the meaner kind of men, because
it saves them from thought upon matters concerning the gen-
eral Welfare. A despotic ruler, moreover, is apt to attend care-
fully to the minor conveniences of the people: he provides
public baths for them; regulates arbitrarily the price of pro-
visions; prohibits monopolies—eXcept those he himself en-
joys; and in many Ways does for them, Wastefully, and with
their money——for of course he has none of his own-—what
they ought to do and could do more cheaply for themselves.
Meantime he thus makes them incapable of acting intelligently
and effectively in great perils, disables them from remedying
abuses, demoralizes them by encouraging their selﬁshness and
love of pleasure, and thus prepares the way, logically, for some
such great and disgraceful catastrophe as has left France hu-
miliated, burdened With debt, with the loss of a large part of
her territory, and, worse than all, with a population unﬁt for

26 , POLITICS non YOUNG AMERICANS.

self-government, after eighteen years of what a multitude of
short-sighted people pronounced a “ splendid reign.”
43. A wise and beneﬁcent despot may for a time greatly

~ and rapidly increase the material welfare of a people; by his

power to command obedience, he may, if he lives lon.g enough,
impose upon them new habits of thought and action, or even

a different civilization; but it is always at the expense of _

qualities which are absolutely necessary to the life of a nation,
and with the result of leaving his subjects unable to maintain
the existence of society if the despotic head should be sudden--
ly removed, or if the state should suﬁer serious attack from
without. Doubtless the Incas greatly beneﬁted the Peruvians,
among whom they introduced some important arts of civiliza-
tion. But under the despotic rule they established, a handful
of Spaniards not only overthrew the government, but when
they had conquered the rulers, the people, too long the subjects
of despotism, lay prostrate at their feet, and, being subjugated,
perished from the earth. -~ . .

44. Thus nations, as well as individuals, need liberty and re-
sponsibility to make them strong. A boy who is coddled by
his parents; who sits behind the stove in winter when others
are playing in the snow; who lies late abed, and has his
pockets full of candy; who must not go into the water until
he can swim; and whose precious life and health are the ob-
jects of his own and his parents’ incessant solicitude,_may look
with pity upon his neighbor, who runs about barefooted, gets
up early to feed the cows, has few clothes and no candy, and
must work for his food; but all human experience and history
show thatthe hardier boy has by far the best chance of be-
coming a useful man, and making an honorable ﬁgure in the
world. His early life has been full of inconveniences, and
perhaps disagreeables; but the overcoming of these has hard-
ened hisframe, trained his will, strengthened the moral side
of his nature, and prepared him thus to withstand trials and
temptations under which his tenderly nurtured neighbor would
sink.

45. I wish you to take notice that there are in every free

UsEEULNEss OF FREE GOVERNMENT. 27'

country a great many persons to whom the duties and respon-
sibilities of citizenship are irksome; and who, too ignorant or
thoughtless to see the evil results of dependence on a govern-

. ment, seek to avoid temporary evils and inconveniences by

delegating to the government greater powers, and seeking to
establish it as a kind of earthly Providence, to guard their pri-
vate aﬁairs, and make their lives easier.

46. Thus we in this country do not yet know how best to
manage our railroads ; and these powerful corporations in some
cases have oppressed parts of our population. There are peo-
ple who seek to cure this evil by making the Federal Govern-
ment take possession of the railroads, or by making it build
new lines. They would, to avoid a temporary inconvenience,
put the transportation of products into the hands of the gov-
ernment; forgetting that government does not transact even
its legitimate work economically and efficiently, and that to
put the vast business of transportation into its hands would be
to corrupt it, to give it the means of corrupting and abusing
the people; to give to a bad ruler monstrous power, sure to
be wickedly used; and, after all, to secure no advantage which
can not be got by other and safer means.

47. In like manner a persistent eifort has been made to put
the business of telegraphing into the hands of the Federal
Government. Not only would the purchase of the present
lines be very costly, and their management by the government
most certainly less satisfactory than now, but this scheme
would greatly increase the number of officeholders, and con-
sequently the means of corrupting the people. What is of
yet greater moment, it would give to the party in power en-
tire control over the public news, and enable a weak or an un-
scrupulous ruler to poison the very sources of public opinion
by giving false or partial reports of passing events, thus making
the people incapable, in an important emergency, of forming
a just opinion of the conduct or misconduct of their rulers.

48. In ‘France, Napoleon went but one step further when he
regulated the price of bread, and forced bakers to sell at a rate
ﬁxed by liimself. No doubt it was a convenience to a poor

28 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

man to get his bread for less than it was worth, but it demoral«
ized him, and helped to make him and the whole population
incapable of independent and judicious political action.

49. In some of our cities the city governments own the mar-
ket spaces where provisions are sold, as though there were any
more reason for thus controlling the market for meat than for
dry-goods. But these market-places which are owned by a
city are generally ﬁlthy, shamefully mismanaged, and a source
of political corruption; while those in private hands are clean
and well-managed.

VII.
on THE DIFFERENT PARTS or A G 0 VERNMENT.

50. Government falls naturally into three diﬁerent depart-
ments: That part which makes the laws; that which executes
them, or carries them into effect; and that which administers
justice, or interprets the laws between man and man.

51. In a rudely organized society or tribe, the chief ‘or head
man assumes all these functions: he gives orders, which are
the laws; he enforces these orders; and he sits as judge in
disputes between members of the tribe. Under any despot-
ism, the ruler exercises the same powers as the chief of a tribe

of savages; but necessarily he acts through agents, his favor»

ites, who make life still less tolerable to the subjects.

52. In order to maintain a free or popular government, it is

necessary that these powers shall be lodged in different hands;
that the body which makes the laws shall have nothing to do
with their enforcement; and that the judges shall be a body

independent of both the legislative and the executive branches

of the government. »Where this division of powers is well es-
tablished and carefully guarded, if at the same time the nation
has suflicient intelligence and public spirit to hold the rulers
it chooses toa strict account, a people’s liberties are reasonably
secure, and they are able to make their government as honest

or DECENTRALIZATION. c 29

. and efﬁcient as they please to have it. For at the elections

they are able to remove those legislators who enacted bad laws,
or that executive oﬂicer who carelessly or wickedly failed -in

the proper enforcement of the laws. Thus the people not--

only rule, but are easily able to distinguish where the fault of
misgovernment lies, and to apply the remedy. In our own
government, this great division of powers is very clearly made:
in the Federal Government, Congress enacts the laws, but can
not execute or enforce them; the President enforces the laws,
but he does not make them; and the courts of the United
States construe the Federal laws, and apply them in disputed
cases. I ‘

There is a still further subdivision, which is of equal impor-
tance to good government, and which is called DEoENrrRAL1-
ZATION. '

VIII.
OF DEOENTRALIZA TION.

53. It has been found advisable, by experience, to still fur-
ther subdivide the powers necessarily intrusted to govern-
ment; to limit the general, or, as it is usually called, the cen-
tral government, to the performance of certain oﬁices or duties
which apply equally to all parts of the nation; and to conﬁde
other powers and duties, having only a local application, to sub-
ordinate, but in their sphere independent governments.

54. Thus, in our own system, the Federal Government at
I/Vashington exercises powers very strictly limited, leaving oth-
ers to the state governments; and yet others to the county
and even to the township governments. ,

55. This subdivision of power and authority is called DE-

‘ CENTRALIZATION; and experience has shown that this political

device is of extreme importance, for two reasons: First, it is a
powerful and the best means of training a people to eflicient
political action and the art of self-government; and, second,
it presentspconstant and important barriers to the encroach-

30 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

ment of rulers upon the rights and libertiesof the nation;
every subdivision forming a stronghold of resistance by the
people against unjust or wicked rulers.

56. Take notice that any system of government is excellent
in the precise degree in which it naturally trains the people in
political independence, and habituates them to take an active
part in governing themselves. Whatever plan of government
does this in a high degree is good—no matter What it may be
called; that which avoids this is necessarily bad.

57. France has for many years been a glaring example of a
most vicious system_of government, and this under the so-call-
ed republic as Well as under the empire, because her Repub-
lican rulers, as much "as her emperors, rejected decentralization
and local self-government, and adhered to a system of central-
ization, Which made and makes liberty impossible. For in
France the central government appoints all the local ofﬁcers,
and the condition there is as though the President of the Unit-
ed States should appoint not only the postmasters, revenue
and law officers, who are properly a part of the Federal execu-
tive, but also the governors of the states, the mayors of cities,
the supervisors of counties, and eventhe justices of the peace
and local police. -You do not need to think profoundly to see
that independence and free government Would be impossible
under a system Which thus removed the pettiest local officers
from the censure and condemnation of their neighbors, and
made them responsible only to the chief authority at Wash-
ington. The ﬁrst time we had a bad man in the presidential
chair he would be tempted by the favorable circumstances to
play the part of-Napoleon, and make himself’ master of the

state. Nor could the people, without great difﬁculty, and prob- .

ably revolution, resist him.

58. To make liberty secure, the powers and responsibilities
of the executive ought to be plainly limited and deﬁned; and
ought to be such, and no greater, that even a bad man in the
executive chair could not, during the term for which he is
chosen, do serious detriment to the republic. For constitutions
are made to ‘guard against bad ojicers, just as laws are made,

OF THE RESPONSIBILITY QF THE EXECUTIVE. 

not to interfere with the good, but to restrain the vicious and
ignorant.

IX.
 THE RESPONSIBILITY  THE EXECUTIVE.

59. The executive is the head and ruler of tl1e political com-
munity. He is so called because he executes or enforces the
laws which the legislative body enacts. With us the President
is the chief executive of the United States; the governor is
the executive head of a state; and the mayor is, or ought to

I be, the executive head of a city.
60. Large powers are usually, and ought always to be, given '

to an executive or ruler; these powers should be, and in con-
stitutional governments are, strictly limited; but within the
limits ﬁxed in the constitution the ruler should have the ut-
most discretion; for thus only can he be held responsible for
faithfully executing the duties of his office. Responsibility
can never be greater than the authority given. Thus you can
see that to tell a general to win a battle, and leave him to make
his own plans, is to ﬁx upon him a large responsibility, because
his authority is practically unlimited. But to order him to
win a battle according to certain plans imposed on him by a
council of war would be to cramp and limit his powers, and
in the same measure to lessen his responsibility—for, if he were
beaten, he might justly say that the plan of action in accord-
ance with which he was compelled to ﬁght was not the best,
and that defeat was not his fault, but the fault of the council,
which impaired his liberty of action; hence he would not
probably exert himself to the utmost.

61. One of the most vicious and dangerous defects in a
scheme of government, therefore, is a mixed and ill-deﬁned re-
sponsibility. Thus if the executive is. intrusted to two or
more persons, confusion and corruption are sure to result, be-
cause it is then impossible to ﬁx the blame for misconduct
upon any one oﬁicer. A board or commission, as an executive

32 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

composed of a number of persons is called, is certain to be

both ineﬁicient and corrupt. This is because it is more difﬁ- .

cult to bring several persons to a prompt decision than one;
and because the blame for ineﬂiciency or misconduct is shift-
ed from one to the other, to the confusion of the public, which
can not tell whom to punish. ‘ .

62. It is another Vicious defect to take away from the ex-
ecutive head the appointment of his subordinates, for he can
not justly be held responsible for the conduct of persons se-
lected by others than himself; and being deprived of what is
of the essence of just authority, he is pretty certain to lose that
strong interest in the conduct of aﬁairs which.he is compelled
to feel when the eyes of the people are ﬁxed upon himoalone,
and he in his single person is held responsible for the admin-
istration of the public business. ’

63. In a well-ordered free government, therefore, the execu-

tive head, being chosen for a speciﬁed time, and having duties

and powers clearly deﬁned and limited, ought to possess the
power to appoint and remove his subordinates at will. In that
case he can be justly held responsible by the people for the
management of affairs. I

64. In our own Federal Government, the Senate has an ad-
visory power in regard to appointments made by the Presi-
dent (but none as to removals) ; and to that extent the Senate
is a part of the executive. This power was given in the Con-
stitution, because those who framed that instrument were more
fearful of the tyranny of a despotic executive than of the worse,
because less responsible, tyranny of a numerous body like the
Senate; and believed it necessary to guard with especial care
against usurpation of power by the President. If they lived
at this day, they would probably wish to remove even this
slight check upon the appointing power, because they would
see that there is butlittle reason to fear an attack upon our
liberties by the President, who has a limited time to serve,
and may be impeached for misgovernment; while it becomes
constantly more desirable to ﬁx responsibility for misgov-

ernment upon a single person, in order that the people may .

OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EXECUTIVE. 33

more easily understand upon whom and how to visit the pun-
ishment. ' A
65. During the administration of President Johnson, the

‘Congress adopted a “tenure of office” law, which prohibited

removals from oﬁice by the President without the consent of
the Senate. The result was, however, not permanence in office,
but the removal of many good oﬁicers who had fallen under
the President’s dislike, and the appointment in their places of
incompetent men who were favorites of senators or representa-
tives, and to get whom into place they persuaded the Senate
to agree to removals. Thus the public service was debauched,
and yet the President was able to say that he had the counte-
nance of the Senate in this work; and blame could not be fast-
ened upon him alone. A more wily and unscrupulous Presi-
dent than Mr. Johnson might have very gravely injured the pub-
lic service under this law, and still managed to escape blame.

66. It is proper to repeat to you that the powers and author-
ity of the Executive under the Federal Constitution are so lim-
ited that even the worst man in that oﬁice can not, without
exposing himself to impeachment and removal, cause serious
harm to the republic during his term of oﬁice; and that the
unjust exercise of the powers which of right belong to him
would makehim so odious to the people that they would at
the end of his term refuse to re-elect him. The easiest way to
defeatthis proper result would be to_ place checks upon him,
which would make him irresponsible for misgovernment in the
eyes of the people.

67. Most of our state constitutions and many city charters
are faulty in this, that they deprive the chief executive of the
power to appoint even‘ his most important subordinates. This
is done on the plea that the people, who are made to elect
these subordinates, have thus greater power; but, as I shall
show you farther on, this is a great mistake, and the cause of
constant corruption in our local politics.

32

' 34: POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

X.
on POLITIOAL PARTIES.

68. In a free_ state there are usually two political parties.

69. These have different names, but their motives are inde-
pendent of names; and it may be said that one of the two
great parties in a free state is composed of men who desire
change, and the other of men who cling to that which is. As
temperaments differ, so men are either Whigs or Democrats,
Democrats or Republicans, according as their characters lead
them to be conservative, dreading change even when it is for

the better, or progressive, welcoming change even if it is for '

the worse. .

70. There is, however, in every free state a third party, lit-
tle heard of, without organization, which does not seek oﬂice,
holds no meetings, and owns no banners. It holds the bal-
ance of power, and it silently decides the elections, and on the
whole» in the right way. This party is composed of the citi-
zens who think for themselves, who look on at the strife little
moved by partisan appeals, and on election day deposit their
votes for the man or the policy which on the whole appears
to them likely to best further the good of the state. This
party is the terror of professional politicians, and often their
confusion. The larger it is in any community, the better will
public aﬁairs be managed, for it is this party which punishes
ineﬁiciency, corruption, or maladministration of any kind, de-
feats the caucuses and scratches tickets when corrupt men are
nominated. It is to this party I wish you to belong, whether
you are a Democrat or a Republican.

71. Party government is necessary in a free state. The or-
ganization of political parties is the only means by which the
sense of the people can be got at elections upon questions of
public policy; and by party government only can responsibil-

on POLITICAL PARTIES. 35

ity be ﬁxed upon political leaders, so that these may receive
approval or condemnation. A non-partisan government is the
dream of weak and amiable men; it belongs to an ideal con-
dition, in which all men shall be unselﬁsh, and sincerely de-
sirous of the public good. In the present condition of man-
kind, a non-partisan government—one in which both or all
political party leaders should share—would be, and has been
wherever it was tried, only an admirable a.nd effective device
to conceal corruption, because it becomes then the interest of
the leaders of both parties to cover up wrong, both having
their share of public plunder. Non—partisan boards were a
favorite device of the New York City Ring.

7 2. A political party appeals to the citizens with what we
call a platform, which means a statement of the policy it de-
sires to see carried out. Necessarily it also nominates men to
enforce this policy in case they are elected by the people.

7 3. If party leaders always declared their opinions and in-
tentions openly and honestly, and if they nominated only
their most capable men, the duty of the citizen would be very
simple. But a political platform is often an ingenious jumble
of words, intended to attract men of opposite sentiments, and
naturally candidates nominated on such platforms are not
likely to be men famous for positive principles. In such
cases the citizen has to choose the least of two evils, and take
comfort in the thought that a country is not badlyoﬁ in
which the people do not ﬁnd it necessary to decide upon vital
principles. It is quite certain that in aifree government like
ours inefficiency or corruption will be punished by the" people
just as soon as they become really dangerous to the nation.
Reform of evils is a slow work in a free state; because the
mass of the people are engrossed in their own aﬁairs, and
conservative in their habits of thought, which means that they
dislike great and sudden changes, even if they appear to be
improvements. This spirit is an admirable one: though often
inconvenient and sometimes costly, it gives stability to polit-
ical and social institutions; and stability is (L main condition

of progress. Thus the people of the United States came very-

36 POLITICS For.‘ YOUNG AMERICANS.

. slowly to the opinion that slavery ought to be extirpated. A

beneﬁcent despot might have set the slaves free by a single
mandate; but as he would have acted regardless of the opin-
ions of the mass of the people, his edict would probably have
caused a revolution, or at least grave and long—continued dis-
orders; whereas, in our slow republican way, we discussed
the question for thirty years; but when slavery struck at the
national life, the nation presently consented to abolish the
evil.’

XI.
WHO VOTE’, AND WHY.

74. Women, minors, paupers, and insane persons have no
vote in the United States.

75. In some countries the electoral franchise, as the right-

to vote is called, is still further limited to persons who can
read and write, or to persons possessing a speciﬁed amount of
property, or paying a certain annual rent" for the premises
they occupy.

76. Property qualiﬁcations originally obtained in a number p

of our states, but they have gradually been abolished.

77. An educational qualiﬁcation is proposed in some states,
and will probably be adopted in. many within the next few
years. Where public or free schools are made accessible to
the whole population, there would be no injustice in requiring
that only those shall vote who can both read and write.

78. Minors, or persons under age, and paupers are not al-_

lowed to vote because they are dependent; _and it is presuma-
ble that they would vote under coercion, and not according to
their independent judgment. Moreover, a person incapable
of managing his private business ought not to have a voice or
inﬂuence in public affairs. It is probable that women are, de-
nied the vote for the same reason———because the greater part of
them are in a dependent condition; and the law takes no note
of exceptions.

WHO vorrz, AND WHY. ' T 37

7 9. General manhood suffrage, which prevails in the United
States, is required. by justice, and is necessary to the perpetu-
ation of peace in a community or nation. By his vote each
man has his inﬂuence upon those affairs which are common to
all the citizens ;i if he is outvoted, he is still satisﬁed, because
it was his hope to outvote his opponents, and it is his hope to
have the ority with him at another time.

80. It is sometimes urged that only those who possess prop-
erty ought to be allowed to vote taxes and appropriations for
public purposes. This proposition has an appearance of jus-
tice; but, besides being generally impracticable, it rests upon
a wrong view of society. It supposes a degree of meanness

and bad spirit in the poor, and of intelligence and liberality in
V the Wealthy, which We do not ﬁnd in actual life; and it would

facilitate a division of men into classes, the poor arrayed
against the rich, Which, if it existed, would make free govern-

‘ment almost if not quite impossible.

81. Suppose even that the poor were not only the most
numerous, but also the least intelligent and the most selﬁsh.
which is not true: it is still a fact that the rich and intelligent
possess great inﬂuence over their poorer neighbors, by reason
of their greater means and knowledge, which it is their duty
to use for the general good. Any regulation which would

83. Take notice that a free state or republic" can not remain
prosperous if the more fortunate of its citizens withdraw tl1em—
selves from political duties to devote their lives to mo11ey—get-
ting or to pleasure. Take notice, too, that when a rich man
complains that his poorer neighbors——many of whom he prob-
ably employs——vote against his interest, you will ﬁnd that he
conducts himself toward them selﬁshly, and thus loses the in-
ﬂuence which his wealth naturally gives him if he rightly
uses it. , '

84. Under our system the states have the exclusive power

of declaring, each for itself, which of the citizens shall vote ;'

being prohibited only from excluding persons on account of
race, color, or previous condition of slavery. They can not,
however, give the franchise indiscriminately, for the Federal
Government has the exclusive authority to declare who shall be
citizens. But any state may adopt an educational or property
franchise or condition, only making it equally applicable to all
its citizens. The advisability of enacting an educational qualiﬁ-
cation for voters is now discussed in several states, and by many
thoughtful persons, and will probably be generally adopted in
time. 8

85. In order to enable the people to ta/re an intelligent and

real interest in politics, it is necessctry that they shall have to

elect but few persons. ‘ r

86. The persons who compose the law-making body ought
to be elected, and at frequent intervals, in order that they may
come fresh from the people, and know their will; also, the
law-making body should be numerous, so that responsibility

may be more easily ﬁxed upon each member by his con-
stituents.‘ _

87 . The executive head of the community, be he President,
Governor, or Mayor, ought to be elected by the people, and

probably at less frequent intervals than the legislative body, ‘

as our Federal Constitution provides, becausethus the govern-
ment gains in stability of purpose, without danger to liberty.

88. The judges ought in no case to be elected, but should
be appointed for life or good behavior by the‘ executive.
Thus only can the majesty and dignity of the courts of justice
be maintained. It is absurd and_ Wicked to degrade a judge
by forcing him to appeal to the voters for election; because
justice has nothing to do with political parties, and ought to
be beyond the inﬂuence of partisan strife. A court does not
deal with policies, but with principles.

89. It is sometimes urged that a President or Governor or
Mayor may appoint an improper person as judge; and this is
true; but even a bad man, placed for life in an exalted and
entirely tndepemlevnt position, is likely to conduct himself Well;
and an executive officer, though he might make a careless or
bad appointment to a temporary oﬁice, will think twice before
he selects for a life office, and one so important as a judge-
ship, a man whose career, if it should be disgraceful, would be
a constant reproach to him who created him judge.

90. The oﬁicers subordinate to the executive ought not to he
elected, but appointed by their chz'ef. Otherwise there is con-
fusion in the government, because chief and subordinates de-
riving their authority from the same source, election, there
arises necessarily division of responsibility, and the public
business is left undone or is corruptly done.

91. The provisions of our Federal Constitution are very
Wise upon this point. The President may appoint and re-
move even so low a grade of officers as postmasters and minor
revenue officers. It has sometimes been proposed to make

the place of Postmaster elective—-but to do so would be to

make these officers irresponsible; and as the President could
not-remove them for incompetency or corruption, because

they would hold their places independently of him, and from
the same source which gave him his, you can easily see that
the Post-office Department would be exposed to the grossest
mismanagement, Without the possibility of a remedy. _

92. VVhat is true of this is true of all the executive de-
partments. No ofﬁcers charged with enforcing the laws
ought to be elected, because they would thus be independent
of their chief, be he President, Governor, or Mayor. The
business of a government does not differ in this respect from
that of a merchant or a railroad company; and no merchant
could successfully conduct his business if his clerks, book-
keeper, and porters were appointed and removable, not by
himself, but by his customers.

93. But in many of our states this blunder is made; and
the people are obliged to elect many minor executive officers,
and even those persons who form the cabinet of the Gov-
ernor; and, as though to breed the extreme of confusion, in
New York and some other states these subordinate officers
are chosen at different times from their nominal chief, and
are thus not merely independent of his will, but often his
political opponents, disagreeing with his policy, and naturally
inclined to fnakejhim inefficient by opposing or carelessly
carrying out his orders. .

94. This foolish system makes government difficult, favors
corruption, and screens ineﬂiciency, because it divides re-
sponsibility among many persons; and it is the cause of
almost all the misgovernment from which so many of our
states and/cities have suffered and are still suffering.

95. It seems to have been the device of ingenious political
demagogues, helped, as these usually are, by Well-meaning
but ignorant people, who were taken "With the plausible ap-

96. For the people, busy with their own affairs, have not
leisure to scrutinize the characters of a number of candidates
presented to them on the same ticket; the press, occupied
with a great variety of public interests and questions, is
equally disabled. Every man, of perhaps a dozen, on a ticket,
uses his inﬂuence to elect all the others, had and good, as
Well as himself, and thus the popular vote is stultiﬁed. See
how diﬂferent is the case in a presidential election. Then the
people are asked to vote for but three persons—the President,
Vice-President, and a Member of Congress; and the charac-
ter, abilities, political principles, and history of these three
individuals receive the closest scrutiny from the press and

public speakers during the canvass, so that every fault or

evidence of unﬁtness is brought to. light, and the people have
a fair chance to vote intelligently. "
97. Only the chief executive oﬁicer, in any system, ought

to be elected by the -people; and upon him should be placed ‘

the grave responsibility of selecting the subordinates by Whose
help he is to carry on the public business. If then he fail, he
and hisparty may fairly he held responsible by the people,

XIII.
OF POLITICAL (IONSTITUTIONS.

98. A political Constitution is the instrument or compact
in which the rights of the people who adopt it, and the
powers and responsibilities of their rulers, are described, and

by which they are ﬁxed.

99. The chief object of a constitution is to limit the power
of majorities. » '

100. A moment’s reﬂection will tell you that mere majority
rule, unlimited, would be thelmost grinding of tyrannies ; the

. minority at any time Would be mere slaves, Whose rights to
life, property, and comfort no one who chose to join the

majority would be bound to respect.

42 ‘ POLITICS FOR YOUNG_ AMERICANS.

101. It is the object of constitutions to protect minorities
in certain common rights, and to restrain the power of major-
ities, who may do, or enact, or cause to be done, only what
in any case the Constitution permits; and have no right, no
matter how numerically strong they may be, to invade the
minority in those rights which the Constitution secures to
all the citizens. - ' i

102. Out of this thought grow all the provisions of a polit-
ical Constitution—-as, for instance, under our own, no majority
can deprive a criminal of trial by jury, or elect its candidates
for longer than a prescribed term, or deprive the minority of
life or property by unequal laws, or enact laws contrary to
the provisions or outside of the limitations of the Consti-
tution.

103. It is a merit in any constitution to be brief, and to
state only general rules or principles, to be applied practically
by the law-making power ;' because thus this instrument,
which ought to be but rarely and cautiously altered, is more
elastic, and more easily applied to changing circumstances,
and to a great variety of life. It is the proper function of
a constitution, for instance, to declare the term during which
a President, a.Member of Congress, or a Governor shall hold
office, for that may and ought to be a permanent regulation;
but it would be an error to ﬁx in the constitution the amount
of salary either ought to receive; or even to prohibit the re-
election of an officer, for circumstances may occur making it
expedient to re-elect. For instance, had the so-called “one-
term principle,” which is not a principle at all, but a mere
foolish expedient, been incorporated in our Constitution, we

should not have re—elected Mr. Lincoln in 1864, an event.

which did more than any battle to bring the war to an end,

by convincing the‘ Southern people that the Federal policy

would not suffer change. It has become a tradition having
the force of a Constitutional provision that the President
shall not be chosen for a third term. The example set by
General Washington, in this respect, is likely to be followed;
for if any President desired a third term, this would be plain

on THE LEGISLATIVE or. LAW-MAKING BRANCH. 43

proof of inordinate and dangerous ambition in him, render-
ing him unfit for the office ; and if in such a case a President
used the power of his patronage to procure a nomination, it
would be wise to vote against him at every hazard. But it
is a proper constitutional regulation that salaries shall not be
increased or diminished during the term of the incumbent;
for a salary is in the nature of a contract, and ought to be
beyond the reach of increase from corruption, or diminution
from party malevolence. It is proper that the Constitution
should prohibit human slavery; but it is better to declare by
laws not only the penalties for smuggling, theft, etc., but also
what constitutes these and other crimes—eXcept treason, which,
being a purely political oﬁense, its deﬁnition ought to be im-
mutably ﬁxed, as it is in our Federal Constitution, and not
left to the political passions of any period. But even here
Congress, in the Constitution, is wiselycharged to declare the
penalty of treason. Again, it is proper that the Constitution
should create a Supreme Court, as ours does; but it would
be unwise that it should also ﬁx the number or location of
minor courts, because as the country grows these may have
to be increased; and accordingly our Constitution leaves Con-
gress to establish these minor courts.

XIV.  
OF THE’ LE GISLA TI VE OR LA W-MAKING BRANCH.

104. Legislative bodies have usually two Houses, as in our
Congress and state Legislatures. In the Federal Congress, the
Senators are chosen by the Legislatures of the different states,

and are supposed to represent the states, while the representa-

tives are chosen directly by the people in districts.

105. Action in ct Zosw-making body means changer; and laws
ought to be changed seldom, and nevenwitliout full discussion
and consideration.

106.’ All the arrangements of modern legislative bodies in

44 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

free nations are wisely made to secure these ends. Thus we
have two Houses, each of which must separately discuss and
agree to a bill before it can become a law; one of those Houses
chosen by a different set of electors or for a longer term than
the other; the executive veto—which, bear in mind, is solely
to ask the two Houses to reconsider their bill, and not at all
to obstruct or abrogate the law—-—for when it once becomes a
law in spite of his veto, the executive is bound to enforce it.
To thelsame end are all the Parliamentary rules and forms
which cause delay in the passage of new laws.

107. All these are wholesome and necessary checks onthe
law-making power. It is therefore a great blunder to accuse
Congress or a state Legislature, as inconsiderate people some-
times do, of “ wasting time in debate.” A representative body
is never so usefully employed as when engaged in discussing
the measures before it; and it is never so dangerous to the
people as when the majority are strong enough to prevent de-
bate, and pass laws by the mere overwhelming force of votes;

because laws so passed, without discussion—which means ex-

amination—are likely to be unwise.

108. Another reproach which is sometimes cast at our legis-
lative bodies is that the ablest men are not chosen to seats.
But our Congress and Legislatures do not pretend to be col-
lections of the ablest men in the nation. They are representa-
tive bodies; and the delegates are supposed to represent the
constituencies. Of course you are to understand that a repre-
sentative is not a mere delegate to utter the voice of his con-
stituents. He is sent to exercise his independent judgment on
pending questions, and not to record what their whims or tem-
porary passions may dictate. He is their wise man, and not
their slave. If the people of any district East or West send
an unﬁt or dishonest person, that is their risk: they leave them-
selves without inﬂuence in the House. Our Congress does
not contain the most brilliant men in the nation, nor all the
ablest men; but it has a great body of solid ability always;
and it is the better for containing little genius.

109. Any one who is familiar with Washington or our state

OF TOWN MEETINGS. 45

capitals knows that constituencies gain immenselyiin political
power by sending able men as delegates, and lose when they
send demagogues; and also -that the inﬂuence of a political
district may be very much increased by keeping the same man
\. long time in its service. But if the people. in any district
or state choose, negligently or perversely, to send only inex-
perienced or incapable men, that is their business, and their
loss. Remember always that ours is a representative govern-
ment, and not a government of the ablest men; and that if
there is any where a constituency composed mainly of foolish
or ignorant or misguided people, they have a right to be heard,
and their folly is likely to be the sooner exploded if it is
officially displayed in Congress, and there subjected to the ﬁre
of open criticism. 1

XV. .
OF, TOWN MEETINGS.

’ 1 10. A town, or township, is the smallest political subdivision
We recognize. The school district is only to regulate the free
school. The wards in cities are the equivalents of the town-
ships in the country. _

111. When the people of a town (or township, as they say
in most of the states) meet together annually to discuss the
affairs of their township, to elect its ofﬁcers, appropriate the
money required to carry on its aﬁairs, criticise what has been
done or left undone in the past year, and to declare, after dis-
cussion, what shall be done or left undone in its local concerns
during the year to come—that is a Town Meeting.

112. In such a place each citizen has opportunity to bring
up such suggestions as he‘ pleases, recommending them with
his best ability; there alone the people act directly, and not
by delegates; and by this democratic‘ parliament the local af-
fairs of the township—-—-its roads, schools, police, health——can
and will be the most efﬁciently and economically managed.

46 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

113. The town meetings have been called the nurseries of
free government, because in them the people learn the art of
self-government; public spirit is developed-, because each citi-
zen may exercise a direct inﬂuence upon aﬂairs with which he
is familiar; men become skilled in debate, and, what is more
important, learn to submit quietly to the majority when that
happens to decide against their wishes. In those states where
town meetings are held, they have always had an important
inﬂuence upon the political character of the population. Un-
fortunately in most of our states the town meeting is unknown
or has fallen into disuse, and the powers which it ought to ex-
ercise are scattered among county and district officers, to the
destruction of one of ourmost important political organiza-
tions.

XVI.
OF ED UUA TION.

114. A certain degree of intelligence is necessary to make a
man a good citizen of a free state. Experience has proved
that an‘ elementary education is very helpful to any one in ac-
quiring this degree of intelligence; though, pray remark, it is
not absolutely essential nor absolutely effective in all cases—
for both you and I know a man who can neither read nor
write, but whose good sense and sound judgment make him a
very admirable citizen; and I have known a number of per-
sons whom even an academic or college education has not Inade

c his equals. Bear in mind therefore that what we call educa-
. tion is not the equivalent of intelligence, but only a very help~

ful means to it. c

115. An elementary education, also, is absolutely necessary
in these days to enable a man to serve successfully in any but
the very lowest occupations, and its general diﬁusion is there-
fore a means to increase the prosperity of a community, and
to prevent pauperism as well as crime.

116. Hence the necessity of schools, and the justiﬁcation of

or EDUCATION; 47

free or public schools. ‘Such a school, maintained and in-
spected by the state, is not a charitable but a political institu-
tion, in the broadest sense. I t is to the interest of all the citi-
zens that every child in the state shall have so much education
as shall enable it to comprehend oar ‘ political institutions, and
to follow intelligently some useful indastrg/. That much the
state, in the common interest, ought to provide free of charge
for all. A child which at fourteen or ﬁfteen has been thorough-
ly drilled in reading, writing, arithmetic, ‘drawing, andthe sim-

pler parts of physical geography, and if possible musical nota-

tion, is fitted either to begin to learn a trade, or, if its parents
desire, to enter a higher school or academy for further studies.
It is not required for the safety or welfare of the state that
all. the children shall be trained or prepared for professional
or business -life.

117. A compulsory school law ought to include the children
of the wealthy as well as those of the poor; and it ought to
compel attendance during four years—-say from ten to four-
teen. The free schools serve an important political use by
bringing all the children of the community together in a way
which makes citizens of all classes know each other, and thus
prevents that alienation of the less from the more prosperous,
which is a grave danger to free government.

118. It has been found very difficult, in most of our states
which have attempted it, to enforce compulsory school attend-
ance under a general law; and this is one of the cases, of
which I shall speak to you farther on, where it is wiser to al-
low the people of a county or town or school district to de-
cide; letting each minor locality determine for itself whether
or not it will compel attendance at school. The question is
new to most of ourpeople; and a compulsory law is not like-
ly to be enforced until its importance is more generally felt.
Again, in the Southern States, prejudice of race would make a
law or regulation compelling the attendance of white and black
children in the same schools hateful to the whites and painful
to the colored children; and such‘ a law would therefore be

highly unwise, and is not likely to be adopted very soon by.

48 . POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

any of those states. Yet the white people of the Southern
States would act most unwisely did they neglect or refuse to
provide free schools for the colored children. For to allovv
any. child, colored or white, to go Without a common-school
education is a costly blunder; because. such neglect will in-

. crease crime and pauperism-—both of which cost the tax-payers

dear. r

XVII.
05' TAXES.

119. The tax is What the citizen pays out of his earnings or
wealth, or both, to defray the necessary cost of protecting his
life and property—to enable him to produce, accumulate, and
exchange With security and convenience, without devoting a
part of his time and strength to the labor of defending him-
self and guarding his accumulations against robbers.

120. This general defense of the lives and property of all
We delegate to governments; and it results that when a gov-
ernment levies taxes, and yet fails to make the life and prop-
erty of every individual secure, it fails of its duty, and robs the
tax-payer. ‘ .

121. Free government is the best, because under it the peo-
ple are able constantly to hold their government responsible,
and force its ofﬁcers to fulﬁll their duties, and to conduct af-
fairs economically; or, if they fail, to remove them and put
more capable men in their places. ’

122. We delegate to the government—-federal, state, city, or
county—also some other duties ‘besides that of protecting us
in life and property, as I have before told you: such as carry-
ing the mails, building and repairing roads, the survey of lands,
the improvement of harbors, etc. To defray the cost of these
undertakings we must pay also a general contribution, which is
improperly called a tax. It is in fact an assessment, upon each
person, for an improvement in the beneﬁts of which he shares;
and for this ‘assessment he therefore gets some return in con-

on TAXES. ‘ 49

veniences. Many things which We thus delegate to govern-
ments or public authorities might be better or more cheaply

done by associated private effort. For instance, toll—roads\

made and kept in order by private corporations are almost al«
ways in better order than county or other public roads; and
as only those pay toll who use them, the tax or assessment
thus laid is more just and equal than one laid on property i11
general, Where the poor are very apt to pay more than their
share. i i

123. But all taxes imposed to defray the cost of preserving
the peace, protecting life and property, dispensing justice, and
punishing criminals, are loss. They are so much taken from
the Wealth or accumulated savings of a nation and ﬂung into
the ﬁre. If all men were honest, peaceable, and just, there
would be no need of governments, there Would be no taxes,
and there would be, therefore, the more Wealth, and, of course,
the more comfort and enjoyment in the World for all. Every
thief, burglar, robber, murderer, every avaricious, grasping, un-
just man, in the community, makes it the poorer, and takes
something from the comfort of every honest man. ‘

124. Hence the -importance that every man shall be a good
citizen, just to his fellows, and honest in all" his dealings;
hence, too, the importance of general education, which tends
toward virtuous conduct, because it better enables men to get
an honest living; of just, equal, and stable laws, because these
tend to make men just and honest, byremoving from them
temptations to greed and dishonest gains. For these taxes
are the costly penalties of vice, ignorance, and selﬁshness.

125. Taxes are either direct or indirect, and it may be said
that direct taxes are those exacted directly from the consumer,
and indirect those paid by the producer, middle-man, or ex-
changer, Who adds them to the price he exacts from the con-
sumers, who thus pay indirectly. .

126. Bear in mind that all taxes are paid by the conszmwr
or user, in the end.

127. Direct taxes are those laid on real estate and on per-
sonal property in actual use, on incomes, and on polls or heads.

C

50 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

Our state and other local revenues are all raised by direct tax‘
ation. ' A

128. Indirect taxes are duties on goods imported, or on
goods manufactured for sale at home; in the last case they
are called excises. But you easily see that the merchant who
imports goods, or the manufacturer at home, does not submit
to the loss of the amount of tax he pays. He makes it in
either case a charge upon his goods, and adds it to their price.
Not only that, but as he must take the risk of loss by ﬁre or
other accident, or by. falling prices or a lack of market after
the duty or excise is paid, he adds a percentage to the price to
cover these risks; for he knows that the government will not
return him the taxes he has paid, no matter if he should en-«
tirely lose his goods the day after he had paid the tax or duty
upon them.

129. Hence indirect taxes are less economical than direct
taxes; they inflict more loss upon the consumer compared
with the amount of revenue raised. But because indirecttaxes
are paid by the consumer with other payments, in small and

often insigniﬁcant amounts at a time, and without the inter— _

vention of that universally hated personagepthe tax—gatherer,
this Inode of raising revenue has ‘always been a favorite with
the people; and because an indirect tax is thus collected with
less friction, and can be increased. secretly, as it were, and with-
out its eﬁect being so immediately and plainly felt by each

individual tax—payer, it has always been a favorite with gov-
xernments.

180. The revenues of the Federal Government are almost
entirely derived from indirect taxes.
131. As these are difficult of adjustment and complicated,

I their arrangement almost always gives opportunity to selﬁsh

and scheming persons to impose upon Congress, and get it to
favor their pursuits either by exemption where a tax should
be laid, or by laying a tax where the general interest requires

none; or ﬁnally, by inducing Congress to change the duty or

tax, either raising or lowering it, by which change manufact-

‘ urers or importers or speculators may make extraordinary

or PUBLIC DEBTS AND SINKING FUNDS. 51

gains. Thus a tax system, whose only proper end is to raise

a certain amount of revenue for the government, is often mis-
applied to providing a bounty for certain favored pursuits, or
enabling inﬂuential speculators to make unjust gains at tl1e
cost of the mass of the people.

132. In spite of these abuses, however, it is probable that
indirect taxation will remain a favorite means of raising rev-
enue in all countries for a long time to come; and the citizens
h-ave no remedy against its abuse, except to insist upon the
sound and indisputable principle that the sole proper purpose
of taxation is to raise the revenue required by the government;
and to hold legislators to a strict account in this matter.

XVIII.
017’ PUBLIO DEBTS AND SINKING FUNDS.

183. It happens, too frequently, that the taxes paid by a
community do not suffice to pay the expenses which are in-
curred by it; and in that case the community, as a corpora-
tion, borrows money. Thus arise national debts, state debts,
county debts, city debts. '

x 184. Our national debt was incurred during the late great
war, and therefore for a necessary end. The cost of carrying

_ on the war to maintain the Union was so great that it could

not, without ruining industry and oppressing the people, be
paid out of the taxes. Hence the Federal Government bor-
rowed vast sums of money. This was done by a process called
“selling bonds.” _

135. A government “ bond ” is simply a certiﬁcate that the
government which issues it owes the holder of the bond a sum
mentioned on its face,'with interest at a rate speciﬁed, payable
at ﬁxed periods; the principal or sum of the bond being also
payable at a ﬁxed time. Instead of sending agents around to
borrow money, it is more convenient for a government or a
railroad or other corporation to prepare such bonds, and there-

52 POVLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

upon offer them for sale. -You may see frequently in the ad«
vertising columns of newspapers, state, city, county, and railroad
bonds thus oﬁered, the advertisement calling for bids for such
bonds, which are, in effect, put up at public auction.

136. The rate of interest named in such bonds is usually
low; but if there are a great many bonds offered, or it is known
that the supply must be great, or the security—which is the
stability or good faith of the government or other corporation
———is doubtful, it can hope to receive only some sum for its bonds
less than the sum which these promise to pay. People deal
with governments‘ in such matters precisely as they do with
individuals. Thus, the Federal Government having to borrow
constantly enormous sums during the war, its bonds fell con-
siderably below par; to that rate, in fact, at which shrewd busi-
ness men here and abroad were tempted to.take the risk of
their ultimate payment. As soon as the war closed, and in-
deed before, when our success was seen to be assured, the
bonds rose in value-—because they became a more desirable,
that is to say, a more secure investment to people who had
money to put out at interest. Wealthy men in Europe, where
the rate of interest is lower than with us, bought constantly
increasing quantities‘ of them. And as the interest has been
regularly paid, and the world generally believes us honest, we
have been of late able to call in many six per cent. bonds, and
borrow money at ﬁve per cent. to pay them oﬁ.

137. The security for a national or state debt is the honesty
of its people. The sheriﬁ, who is the ofﬁcial collector of debts,
can not levy upon a nation, nor upon a state. All private cor-
porations, such as railroads‘, can be sold out; their bonds are
true mortgage bonds, whose owners can foreclose and sell out
the property pledged as security for their payment.

.138. If you owe so ‘much money that to pay the interest on
it requires the greater part of your income, you will readily
comprehend that this might be a serious embarrassment to you.
It would make you poor, even if you had a large income. A
private person in such a dilemma, if he has property, usually
sells some of this, to pay off his debt or a part of it; if he has

OF-PUBLIC DEBTS AND SINKING FUNDS.“ 53

little or no property and is hopelessly in debt, he. becomes a
bankrupt, and on surrendering all that he has to hiscreditors,
his debt is canceled under the operation -of the bankrupt law.-
But a nation or a municipal corporation l1as no property to
sell or to surrender to its creditors; it can not take the benefit
of the bankrupt act. It must pay.

139. But the interest it pays is drawn from the people by
taxation. A heavy debt therefore necessarily increases the
taxes; and these may become so burdensome as to cripple the
industry and energy of a people. You see therefore the folly
of the assertion which used to be made by some people dur-
ing the War that “ a national debt is a national blessing.” A
debt is never a blessing,»any more than a lame foot or a cur-
vature of the spine. You see also the fallacy of the assertion
which is sometimes heard that what We borrow abroad does
not cripple us. On the contrary we have to send money or
products abroad, to pay both principal and interest of our for~
eign indebtedness, and this is of course a tax upon our re-
sources. - - _

‘ 140. A sinking fund is a contrivance invented by a great
English minister, Williain Pitt, as an additional security for
the repayment of a national debt. .

141. It is not uncommon, when a nation makes a loan, to
set apart «a special portion of its revenueor income for the re~
payment of this loan. Thus the Federal Government has
pledged so much of its revenue from customs as is necessary
to pay the interest on its debt. ,

142. By the establishment of a sinking fund, another part
of the revenue is set aside annually to pay also the principal,
When that shall become due. The sum so set apart is put at
interest, and this interest is again invested, and thus com-
pounded. Money at compound interest at six per‘ cent.
doubles itself‘ in about twelve years; and thus you see that in
time a sinking fund may be made, out "of a small beginning
to pay off a large debt. ‘

143. Modern ﬁnanciers, however, discourage sinking funds‘

by governments; because it has been found that the sums

thus accumulated are sometimes used for current expenses, in
a national emergency; and thus the nation has been taxed be-
forehand to supply, perhaps, a wasteful ruler with means for
profuse expenditure. ' a ‘

144. The book-keeping of nations and states is often com-
plicated by different accounts and sinking funds. It ought to
be plain and clear, so that every citizen could at a glance see
thereal state of _the ﬁnances.

OF PROPERTY.

145. Whatever‘ you earn or produce or create by your labor
or ingenuity or forethought, or all combined, is your property;
it belongs to you, because you have taken the trouble to pro-
duce it; and you have the right to do with it what you Will.
You may, for instance, consume or Waste it all.

146. If you produce more than you consume, What remains
over is still your own, your property, to which you have the
exclusive right against other persons. This surplus which re-
mains over in your hands is-called capital. Thus if you have
saved enough from your product to buy yourself a spade, or a
chest of tools, or a plow and span of horses, these articles are
properly capital, and their possession constitutes you to that
degree a capitalist. Ignorant persons misuse this Word, and im-
agine a capitalist to be one who has accumulated some vague
but large amount of property. I Want you to understand
that this is‘ a foolish limitation of the meaning of this word.

147. Capital might be called the net proﬁt of labor,if it
were not that, in order to its existence, another element than
labor is required, namely, self-denial or economy. For it is
possible for a man to destroy, by consumption or Waste, or
both, all that he earns or produces; and a considerable part of
mankind do actually live in this way—-from hand to mouth,
as we say.

or PROPERTY. L 55

‘148. Industry and economy united are therefore required,
as you see, to accumulate that surplus which we call capital;
and as both these are voluntary and irksome exercises: as you
deny yourself both when you engage in productive labor and
when you refrain from consuming or wasting what you have
produced, it follows that no other person can have so good a
claim on your surplus as yourself.

149. In a rude or savage society, a man who wished to ac-
cumulate property had not only to labor to create it, and to
exercise self—denial to save it, but he had to devote a consider-
able part of his time and strength to defending his possessions
as well as his life against others. To save this last necessity,
society and governments exist, their use being to make life
and property secure against attack ; and by a general co—oper-
ation and contribution of efforts or of means to overawe and
punish depredators. Armies, navies, the police, the courts,
and the body of laws in obedience to which all these act in a
free state, are simply means for the protection of life and
property at a cheaper rate and in a more effective manner
than could be done._by_ individual eﬁorts; and every nation is
therefore, in this respect, only a great co-operative association,
in which each member contributes somewhat fromihis accu-
mulations or earnings to pay the charges for preserving the
rest. It is only by thus delegating the power of protection
to a few members of society that the remainder can get time
to produce sufficient for consumption and a surplus—which
surplus we call wealth or capital. And it is only where this
protection is efective that men are. encouraged to the labor and
self—denial necessary to create property or wealth.

150. I want you to fix ﬁrmly in your mind that every dol-
.lar’s_worth of property or wealth in ‘the world is a dollar’s
worth of proof that somebody at some time did not only la-
bor to produce it, but denied himself some pleasure or com-
fort in order to save it. For though God gave us the soil,
the seasons, rain, and many other means of production-——just
asihe gave us our hands, strength, and brain——these are in
themselves not wealth. The gold lay in California for cent

56 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

uries, and was useless and worthless until man’s labor dug it
out; and in like manner every natural product is Worthless
until the labor of man is applied to it. For instance, the
plains of California might be covered with Wheat; but, unless
it was harvested, it would be Worthless. You may say that
cattle would eat it; but unless the cattle Were afterwards
caught and slain, and their hides and meat preserved by the
labor of men, they would be Worthless; and if, being caught,
they were Wastefully shot and left to rot, no surplus or capital
would be saved. _ .

151. Remember, too, that What We call the Wealth of a na-
tion is only the aggregate Wealth of its members, and repre-
sents the results of their industry and self-denial. To in-
crease this Wealth, therefore, a people must both labor and
save; and to be encouraged in these irksome duties, they
must feel themselves secure in the enjoyment of What they
produce and accumulate. Every thing, therefore, which makes
property less secure, which exposes it not merely to open
attack by predatory men, but to loss by bad laws, or by _inef-
ﬁcient or corrupt rulers, weakens the spirit of accumulation.

152. But to maintain civilization, great accumulated Wealth
and an active desire by the people to accumulate more are ab-
solutely necessary. If you will try to imagine a_ nation Whose
members have accumulated no property, you will see that to
them civilization. is impossible, even if they desired it. For
such a people would have neither houses, cattle, nor tools———-
all of which are accumulated Wealth or capital, to possess
which men must previously have labored and denied them-
selves. But you must see that such a civilization as ours re-
quires much more than houses, cattle, and tools. We have
schools, shops, factories, roads, railroads, steamboats, tele-
graphs, and a great multitude of other things, to possess any
one-of which We must have accumulated, previous to their
construction, property or Wealth enough by our labor and self-
denial to pay their cost. A nation Whose members had accu-
mulated no property, and Who consequently lived from hand

i to mouth, could not afford to build a railroad or a factory or

or MONEY. 57-

a scl1ool—house; each person would be busy providing food
for himself ; and no laboring force could be diverted to these
other objects, because no means or capital would be at hand
to support such a force while it was laying a stone Wall or
rolling a rail, which at the close of the day they could neither
eat nor. clothe themselves With.

153. Nor, if accumulation should at any time cease, could‘

civilization continue; because in such a case‘ the Wealth al-

ready accumulated would quickly be spent, and the nation»

would be left without the means to maintain its instruments
of civilization. If, for instance, the Californians had unani-
mously determined to dig out all the gold in their mountains,
and conﬁne themselves rigidly to that industry alone, or if
California had been a sterile desert, yielding only gold, when
the mines gave out they would l1ave had to abandon the
country, and leave it once more to become a desert. As pro-
duction and accumulation ceased, civilization would have fled
the state. But as the land is fertile and the settlers turned
also to agriculture, they used natural resources which, unlike
gold mines, never fail ;. and the accumulation of Wealth Went
on when gold ceased to be abundant.

OF MONEY. I y

154. But to encourage production andfacilitate accumu-
lation, something besides security of property is required.
Each man can not produce all the articles he needs for
comfort and enjoyment, because many things which he de-
sires can not be produced in the climate or on the soil where
he lives. Moreover, he can Work to much greater advantage,
produce more easily, and accumulate more rapidly, if he con-
ﬁnes himself to one or a few articles of production. If you
arega carpenter and I a shoemaker, it Would plainly be an ad-
vantage to both of us, I Wanting a house, and you shoes for

58 POLITICS non YOUNG AMERICANS.

your family, if we agreed_that you would build me the house,
and I should make you a certain number of shoes. This kind
of exchange is called barter.

155. Imagine now a tribe or nation to whom barter is un-
known, but who have learned to accumulate property. Each
family aims to provide all it needs by its own labor; and
whatever its surplus may be it stores away. You will see
the monstrous inconvenience of such a condition, because the
surplus may be perishable. But, What is far more ‘serious,
such a surplus could have no value ,' for unless it could be
sold, which means exchanged for some other articles giving
comfort or enjoyment, it would simply accumulate, and in
time rot. That is to say, unless you can exchange your sur-
plus for something else, it is absolutely worthless.

156. Fix clearly in your mind, therefore, that to establish
industry and self—denial, which means to make civilization
possible, it is necessary, ﬁrst, that property shall be secure;
and, second, that the possessors of property shall be able
freely to exchange it for other ‘articles which they desire;
and that if you take away the possibility of exchange, produc-
tion will cease. . .

157. If you had hides and I coffee, you might, if you
could ﬁnd me, give me hides for my coffee; and thus both
of’ us would be beneﬁted and pleased. We should, however,
ﬁrst be at the trouble of ﬁnding each other, and would prob-
ably waste much time in this pursuit, which would be so
much taken from the production of other hides _and coffee.
If now a third person should appear, ready to carry your
hides to me, and bring back to you my coffee, plainly that
would be an advantage to both of us, who could go on in
the pursuits in which we had most skill, and in which there-
fore we could produce the most.

158. This third person is called a merchant, and his busi-
ness is commerce. For his trouble we should both be ready
to pay him a share of our products, because by using his
labor and skill we are enabled to produce a greater quantity.

159. But how am I to be sure that the merchant to whom

or MONEY. . v 59

I intrust my coffee is honest, and that he will really bring me
back hides? He may be a rogue. To smooth the Way and
make us both secure, We have an ingenious contrivance called

‘ MONEY, the precise nature of which it is very important that

you should understand. .

160. If the merchant who offers to exchange for us our
hides and coffee can leave with us, as a pledge of his honesty,
something which either of us will accept of the other as really
valuable, and equally Valuable with our products, we shall of
course be satisﬁed. For if the merchant should disappear
with your hides, you .Would still have that with Which‘ you
could buy my coffee. .

161. Take another example: If you are a shoemaker, it is
necessary for you to receive for your shoes either the actual

, articles you need to consume, or something which will buy

these. You may be willing to accept for shoes an order on
the farmer for oats and butter, another on the miller for
ﬂour, another on the tailor for clothing, another on the hatter
for hats. But your great object has been to have at the end
of all these transactions a number of shoes for which you
need no article which is at once to be consumed by you or
your family. These surplus shoes, the result of labor and
self-denial, are your capital. What will you take for them?
Not an order for more butter, oats, ﬂour, clothes, h_ats——for
your shoes will keep as well or better than any of these ar-
ticles. Yet they are cumbrous; rats may eat them ; a damp
storage-place may spoil them; ﬁre may destroy them; "in
course of time they would rot; and a new fashion in shoes
may meantime make them unsalable. If you could get for
your surplus shoes something which had real and universal
value, and which yet should not be cumbrous or easily de-
stroyed, or subject to loss by change of fashion, you would
evidently be beneﬁted.

162. This something is gold and silver, two metals Whose
peculiarity is that their rarity, the cost of obtaining them
from the mines,‘ and their Wide use for ornamental purposes,
give them a ﬁxed value all over the civilized world, and

6O POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

which are not cumbrous nor easily destroyed. A hundred dol-
lars’ worth of shoes require a storehouse, with guards against
dampness, ﬁre, and rats. A hundred dollars’ worth of gold
or silver you can lay away on’ a shelf, or, if necessary, carry in
a bag. _

168. Still, if you were going to exchange your shoes for
gold or silver, you would have to assay it, to ascertain ‘its
purity, and to weigh it, that you should be sure of getting
the proper quantity and purity. To save you and all of us
these time—wasting labors, governments undertake the trouble
of coining. This means that the government, at a mint, as-
says the gold and silver, puriﬁes them, and by a mark on
each coin denotes its ﬁneness and weight. That is to say,
it certz:ﬂes that a silver dollar, or a gold ﬁve—clollarp2'ece, really
contains a clollar’3 worth of silver or five dollars’ worth of gold.

164. It follows that a gold or silver dollar is an object hav-
ing a real value. If you choose to melt it, you can sell the
gold or silver in it for a dollar. If you give it in exchange-
for a dinner, you do not swindle the tavern—keeper.

165. The government, having for the general convenience
and economy coined the money or certiﬁed its value, may
rightly, for the same end, punish false coiners or counter-
feiters; and it may declare that its coinage shall be accepted
by all the citizens in their transactions at- the weight and
purity which it has certiﬁed—which is called making it a
“legal tender.” This is in order that no man shall put his
neighbor to trouble, in making payments, by disputing these
qualities of the coin.

166. But it is evident that this does not give the govern-
ment a right to debase the coinage, by certifying that to be a
dollar which contains less than a dollar’s worth of gold or
silver, for this would be to cheat the people; still less can it
aflix arbitrary denominations to things, as pieces of birch-
bark, or ofpaper, and command them to be accepted as
money, or make them a legal tender as we say, for this would
be to authorize one citizen to swindle another. All that the
government cloee in coining is for the general convenience to de-

dare the purity and cerzféfy the actual /weight of a piece of
metal. 4

167,- Since the great gold discoveries in California and
Australia, gold l1as been more exclusively used for money
than formerly; and in several countries, our own among the
number, silver coins have been struck worth a trifle less than
their face or denomination, the object being to prevent waste
from melting and recoining. Such coins are called “tokens,”
and are used only for convenience as “ small change.”

XXI.
OF’ LABOR AND CAPITAL.

168. The spirit of accumulation———of industry and self-denial
r-—being once aroused in a people, and encouraged by their
security in the enjoyment of property, and facility in exchang-
ing their surplus products, Which gives them value, it is clear,
considering the diﬁerence in men——some being Weak of body,
less persistent, less ingenious, or less self—denying than others
—that inevitably some will accumulate less property than
others’; and that many Will, in fact, accumulate nothing, but
consume all they produce, and as fast as they produce it.

169. But in many emergencies of a man’s life it is ab-
solutely necessary that he shall have -some surplus to start
with. Take as an instance the gold-hunters in‘ the early days

of California. A multitude of men rushed to the rich placer

diggings, hopeful of speedy fortune; but a large part of
them presently-discovered that they must eat and drink, and

V be clothed and sheltered, While they looked for and dug out

gold; and not having a surplus sufﬁcient to provide them-
selves with food, clothing, and shelter in this emergency, What
should they do? Die? No; a man who found himself in
that situation sought out another Who had a surplus, and said
to him, Give me food, clothing, and shelter, or the means of
getting these, and I will give you my strength and skill, until

62 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

I have saved by self—denial a surplus sufﬁcient to enable me
to prospect and dig on my own account. That is to say, he
became a laborer for hire, or wages.

170. Suppose now he could have found no one thus ready
to hire him and pay him wages? Suppose every man who
had a surplus (this surplus being capital) had laid it away in
a strong box, and refused to use it in paying wages for the
labor of the man without surplus? Do you not see that the
chief suﬁerer in this case—tl1e only immediate sufferer indeed
—-—would be the man without surplus or capital, and in need
of food and other necessaries of life, which he could get only
by wages—or theft? V

171. But here you have the whole question of capital and
labor; and if any body tells you that there is a necessary and
natural antagonism between capital and labor, you may safely
set him down as an ignorant man. '

172. Capital is simply accumulated savings. He who has
it becomes the enemy of labor only when he hides his capital
in an old stocking or a ﬁre—place, or in the ground: when he
refuses to make use of it. VVhen he does this we call him a
miser, and despise and dislike him, as is but just, for then only
he sets up his selﬁsh interest against his fellow-men.

17 3. But while property, surplus, or capital is used by its
possessors, it is a beneﬁt to the whole mass of those who have
no capital, and to whose advantage it is, as in the case of the
needy miner, to be able to receive wages for their labor. The
more numerous the laboring or non—capitalist cla.ss is, the more
important to them, you must see, is a ‘large accumulation of
capital, for they depend on that to enable them to earn wages,
and in their turn, if they will exercise self-denial, to save _a
surplus; and no one is so seriously injured as the laborer for
Wages, by any event——-be it a war, an unjust law, or a corrupt
government—-.——which lessens the safety of accumulations, alarms
their owners, and makes them reluctant to venture on new en-
terprises. '

174. It is therefore fortunate for the less prosperous of
mankind that the spirit of accumulation leads those who own

or LABOR AND CAPITAL. 63

property to seek ways in which to use this very property or
capital in adding to their stores; for thus the eforts of the
poor, the non—capitalists, are lightened, and made more pro-
ductive for themselves than they otherwise could be. 1'

17 5. Capital is simply accumulated savings. In the Unit-
ed States any laborer may hope to acquire property, if he
has health and intelligence, by the exercise of industry and
economy; and it is one of the commonest, as well as, to a
thoughtful man, one of the most satisfactory experiences, to see
a young man, after laboring faithfully for hire for a time, pres-
ently begin on his own account, and by and by become, in his

_turn, the employer of other men’s labor as well as his own.

176. VVhile it will probably, for a long time to come, be
necessary as well as advantageous to the mass of men to labor
for wages, that country is the most fortunate in which it is the
easiest for an industrious a11d self-denying citizen to lift him-
self from the condition of a hired man to that of independence,
however modest. It is extremely important that neither laws
nor customs shall interfere with this change, but that all doors
shall be opened for it. For though not one in a thousand of
the laborers for wages may choose thus to elevate himself to
independence, it adds materially to the contentment and hap-
piness of all to believe that if they chose to do so they might;
and that efforts not beyond their powers would always open
the way to them.

177. As the accumulated wealth or savings in any country
is thus a source of subsistence and a means of advancement,

not merely to the individual owners of this wealth, capital, or 1

property, but to the whole population, and especially to that
part of it which labors for wages, and who could not receive
wages if accumulated capital did not exist, or  it were de-
strog/ed, so it may be said without exaggeration that no part
of the community has so vital an interest in the abundance, free-
dent, and security of capital as those who labor for wages. For
though the individual capitalist may be seriously inconven-
ienced by events which lessen or make insecure his accumula-
tions, he has still the resources of removing his capital, espe-

64 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

cially if it consists of money, to a more secure place, of with-
drawing it, at whatever loss, from enterprises which afford
employment by giving tl1e means out of which to pay wages,

or, in the ‘final resort, of living upon it without seekingany re-

turn for its use. In any of these cases the laborers for hire suf-
fer ﬁrst and most severely. This you may see in every great
panic and business crisis in our country, when those who pos-
sess a surplus or capital at once begin to hoard it, and to with-
draw it from enterprises; and it is seen upon a large scale in
such a country as Mexico, where long-continued civil disorders
have caused both the hoarding and removal of capital, and
where, consequently, though the wealthy live well enough, and
even increase their capital, the mass of the people remain in
indigence, and ﬁnd it extremely difficult to achieve more than
a ha11d—to—mouth existence, and this though their country has
great natural wealth and a ﬁne climate. ,

17 8. Consequently those who assert that capital is the en-
emy of labor, or who favor unjust laws, arbitrary. interference
with the course of industry or the uses of capital, or a corrupt
and wasteful administration of the government—-—all which are
attacks upon capital and its owners——are the worst enemies of
the laborers for wages, and injure these precisely in the de-
gree in which the unjust law or wasteful administration dis-
courages or hinders the accumulation of capital.

179. Hence trades—unions and international societies, when
they teach that capital is the foe of labor, and that the labor-
er for wages ought or must always remain a hireling; when,

_ in carrying these doctrines into practice, they endeavor to limit

the number of hours a laborer shall work, and the number of
persons who shall learn a trade; or when they support usury
laws, an irredeemable paper currency, and extravagant appro-
priations by the government for public works——-really strike _a
blow at the comfort and prosperity -of the class which labors
for wages.

180. In several following subdivisions I shall try to make
plain to you how interference with the free use, circulation,
and increase of capital is, aside from its injustice, specially in»

or USURY LAWS. ' o 65

jurious to the non—capitalist class——to those who labor for
Wages—-and to whose advantage it is to be able to accumulate
a surplus, and to become, by their honest labor, capitalists
themselves. For I remind you again that a “capitalist” is not
necessarily a man of great wealth. The carpenter Who owns
his chest of tools is to that extent a capitalist: he has a sur-
plus, which he can sell or rent out. The Liverpool match-
boy, who called himself a “ timber—merchant on a small scale,”
was not so far wrong: he had goods to sell; and if he owned
the matches, he Wasalso a capitalist——to thateextent.

XXII.  
OF USURY LA W8.

c 181. If you have any kind of surplus property or capital,
you may hide it, like a miser; or you may use it yourself in
enterprises Where it enables you to employ the labor of others,
for which you pay them Wages; or you may let some one else
use it. »

182. If you part with your property permanently, or sell it,
you expect to get for it an equivalent, in money or some other
kind of property. ‘If you part with it temporarily, or lend it
to another, you reasonably demand an equivalent to repay you
for the temporary deprivation of its use or enjoyment. Thus,
if "you lendor let your house or farm or money, you require
and receive rent—the rent ofmoney being called interest.

183. The rent which you would be willing to pay for a

, tWo—story frame house depends on its situation, the purpose

for which you can use it, and the number ‘of persons who
would like to occupy it. For if it Were even very valuable,
but to you only, and valueless to every one else, it is clear that
I, the owner, could not demand a high rental, because you
Would refuse to give it. Nor would it be unjust in you to
offer only a low rental, because, in such a case, if the‘ house is
Valuable to you alone, that proves that it is your skill, your in- _

66 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

1 dustry, your labor and talent, or your self-denial, and not the

intrinsic value of the house, which are under the circumstances
to give it value. »

184. Not only does the rental value of the house depend on
its situation, but it is likely to vary from year to year, as sim-
ilar houses are more or less abundant, or as there are more or
fewer purposes for which they can be used.

185. If, now, Congress or a state Legislature should enact
a law prescribing that all two—story frame houses throughout
a state or the United States should be rented for no more than
ﬁfty dollars per annum, this would evidently be a ridiculous,
and moreover an unjust regulation, for such a house may be

ﬁvetimes as desirable in one situation as in anotl1er—that is

to say, ﬁve times as valuable to you, who want to hire its use
of me. 8 , 1

186. But take notice that while such a law might tempora-
rily and in the ﬁrst instance beneﬁt a part of the poorer peo-.

-ple—for whoseadvant-age demagogues would cry out for its

adoption—it would presently and permanently injure them;
for, ﬁrst, it would at once put a stop to the building of such
houses, whereby mechanics would be thrown out of employ-
ment; second, it would incommode the poorer people, by
lessening the number of houses in proportion to occupants,
and conﬁning them therefore to narrower quarters; and, third,

capital, thus menaced and oppressed, would take alarm, and be

rapidly removed to countries where the people were not silly
enough, and demagogues not powerful enough, to enforce such
arbitrary regulations. And while not merely the capital which

was originally intended to be invested in two-story frame‘

houses, but much other capital, would thus disappear, and all
enterprises supporting labor would be checked, the owners of
two—story frame houses, who would actually lose, would in
their turn be so much less able to employ labor. Thus, _for
the temporary gain of a small partof the people-—the occu-
piers of two—story frame houses already built——the whole la-
boring. population, the mass of the people, would be seriously
injured. ' *

or USURY LAWS. 67

1-87. It is therefore clearly to the general advantage that
the house—owner shall be allowed to make such arrangements
with his tenants as to rent as shall be mutually agreeable to
them.

.188. But a tWo—story frame house is "the equivalent of mon-
ey; money was expended to build it; and what is true of the
house is equally true of the money. If you borrow_ my house,
it is to use it, and I exact payment for this use, and graduate
payment according to the demand for it, just as you agree to
pay according to its value to you. If you borrow of me a
thousand dollars, it is equally to use it: you may want to
build with this sum a two—story frame house. A Clearly the law

ought not to interfere either to compel you to pay more or

me to receive less than we can mutually agree shall be a fair
rental or interest for the money.

189.’ Obviously no Legislature can tell beforehand what I
ought to pay or you to receive as rent for your money any
more than for your house, because it can not take into account
all the various and varying circumstances of each case. It is
just as ridiculous, unjust, and injurious to the mass of the peo7
ple to prohibit men from paying more than seven per cent. for
money as to declare that they shall pay no more than ﬁfty
dollars a year rent for a two-story frame house.

190. For in the one case, as in the other, capital, arbitrarily
interfered with, seeks other uses, and ﬂies away to freer" re-
gions, in each case to the z°njm'y of the non-capitalist class, be-
cause the wages fund is lessened if capital is diminished.

191. In practical effect, as money is a form of capital easily
concealed, a usury law works in this way: Some capital is
sent away to places where no such law prevails, as from ew

cause it obliges him to pay a considerable sum down, of which

he entirely loses the use, and on which he gets no interest.’

Moreover, where usury laws prevail and are enforced, borrow-
ers have generally to fee an agent or middle—man, who receives
the premium, in order to save the lender harmless against the
law. Thus not only do usury laws make capital less abun-
dant——and of course enterprises and wages less in the same
measure——but the borrower himself is usually injured by hav-
ing to pay premiums graduated upon his individual necessities,
and not upon the general demand for money.

192. On the other hand, many of the WesteI‘n States will
show you the advantage, not merely to a country, but to the
individual laboring man, of letting borrower and lender arrange
their own terms. These states were rapidly built up on bor-
rowed capital, which they drew from the East by the offer of
high rates of interest. Cultivating a rich soil, and settled on
cheap lands, the Western farmers could afford to pay high
rates of interest, because their returns were very great. An
Indiana farmer twenty years ago could well aﬁord to give
twenty per cent. for money, because if he used it to buy Con-
gress land and plant corn, his first crop often. paid for his
whole investment. “If It can make thirty per cent., why
should I hesitate to pay ﬁfteen 9” said a sensible Western
farmer to me only a few years ago. Obviously he was right;
and a law prohibiting him from paying more than seven would
have been an injury to him and to hundreds of others like him
——namely, laboring men without capital, but able to make eX—
traordinary gains by their labor if only they could borrow a
little capital. It would have injured them, because they could
have borrowed no money at a low rate. Take, for instance, a
laboring man who, by saving his wages, was able to buy one
hundred and sixty acres of Congress land, butmust borrow
the means to plant his crop and harvest it. He could aﬁord
to pay a high rate of interest; he could not afford to let his
land lie idle. I t was the poor man who was beneﬁted by the
power to borrow, of which a usury Zaw would have deprived
him by keeping money out of the state.

193. It is sometimes said that high interest eats up the poor.
But plainly it is only the improvident or speculative poor who
suffer. On the contrary, it ought to be said that natural rates
of interest will make men more prudentin entering upon new
enterprises; for they will more accurately count the cost, and
will be less apt to expose themselves to vicissitudes and
chances. Many a man borrows at seven~per cent., and pays a
premium making his interest equal to ten or twelve, who
would hesitate to borrow at ten or twelve per cent. outright. ~

194. Bear in mind, then, that usury laws are injurious chieﬂy
to those who labor for wages, by lessening the wages fund of

. the country, and by disabling them from borrowing sums by

the help of which they might, with energy and prudence, be-
come capitalists in their turn, and achieve independence.

195. You see, therefore, how short-sighted is the policy of
those who oppose the repeal of usury laws in the states, and
have even demanded that Congress shall enact such a law to
apply to the whole United States.

XXIII.
OF BANKS, BANKING, AND UREDIT.

196. If I have a thousand dollars which I shall need to use
three months from now, but do not need iii the mean time, it
would be an advantage tome to be able, to lend it out at in-
terest for three months. But it might happen that you want-

‘ ed to use a: thousand dollars for three months and no more;

and it would be an advantage to you to be able to borrow, not
for a year or a longer term, but for three months only. If we
two could know of each other’s wants at the right time, both

of us would be beneﬁted; and not we two only, but also all

whom our oint arrangement enabledyou to employ with my

thousand dollars, and me with the interest I received of you.
197. In every civilized community there are daily hundreds,

or rather hundreds of thousands, of such instances; and BANKS

70 A rorrrres non round AMERMANS.

are established to enable the borrower and lender to be quick-«
ly accommodated. Experience has shown that the demand of
lenders can be foretold, depending, as it does, upon business
transactions arising out of commerce, manufactures, and agri-
culture, which have their regular periods. A banker, there-
fore, acts upon his knowledge of the laws of commerce and
the laws of nature, which tell him that money realized by one
set of transactions may be safely loaned to persons engaged in

‘ another set, to be returned in time to be used for a third, and

so on. You can see, for instance, that a miller, having sold
his ﬂour, can lend his money to a farmer, who wants to plant
his crop; provided that at harvest the farmer, who will then
sell his crop, will return the loan to the miller. The store-
keeper, with Whom laborers spend their wages for the necessa-
ries of life, receives meantime money, which he may lend to
the miller in case he should want to repair his machinery.
198. A bank is an association to facilitate such loans, and
its interests are therefore harmonious with those of the whole
community, and especially with those of the class who work

for wages; because the less capital lies idle, the more will be at -

the disposal of those who want to employ labor and pay wages.
199. A bank is in fact an association for the safekeeping
and the loaning of money. It becomes responsible to us for
the money we deposit with it; allows us to draw" checks at will
against our deposits; in some cases pays us a low rate of in-
terest on the sums we leave with it; and makes its proﬁt by
lending_at higher rates. As it is responsible to us for _our
money, it must lend on good security only, and must know the
character as well as the circumstances of borrowers; and as it
must  us our money at any time, and without previous
notice?‘  managers can lend only at short dates, or “on call”
s, to be repaid by the borrower after a short interval,
or  emand. And it is to the banker’s interest not only to
makifas many loans as possible, but to make them prudently,
to competent men on good security; for he has capital of his
own at stake, and if he should fail to pay his depositors on de-
mand, they, would close his bank and seize his property.

  
 

or BANKS, BANKING, AND CREDIT. 71

200. Thus you see that a bank is a means for the economic-
al use of capital; and every economy of this kind makes more
abundant the fund out of which wages are paid, and thus se-
cures a greater range and amount of employment to those who
work for wages. ~

201. What is thus true of banks is, of course, equally true
of credit in general. If a mechanic, on the strength of his
good name and of his chest of tools, can borrow a hundred
dollars for a year or for a term of years, and if he has a proﬁta-
ble use for the money, evidently he is beneﬁted by the credit
he l1as. He may use it topay the wages of men he employs;
and with the help of a small loan may in time achieve real in-
dependence. And if, after having accumulated property, his

character and property secure him credit for ten thousand dol- ,

lars, and enable him to employ ﬁfty or a hundred men, still

that credit would be a beneﬁt not only to him, but to all whom

by its help he was able t_o employ for wages.

202. Thus _c7°eolit is may’-ul to the poor, and not merely to the
rich ,' and to the many, and not only to the individuals who
have or use it.

203. But it may be misused; as if I should borrow money
to be used iii an enterprise, as a mill, which was unproﬁtable.
Here my laborers would still receive the money in wages. I
should lose that; but they and the mass of laborers also would

lose, secondarily, because the capital sunk or lost in the un-;
-proﬁtable mill would be dead; it would never more be avail-

able for wages or consumption; it could not increase, and
would produce no proﬁts available for wages; and by every
such loss of capital, the whole community, including, as you
plainly see, the laborers for wages———the non—capitalists as well
as the capitalists——are the poorer. Thus when a bad law
tempts or forces capital into naturally unproﬁtable industries,
this is a loss -to the mass of the laborers as well as to‘ the
owners of the capital. '

204. lln many cases, indeed, the individual capitalist prudent-
ly saves himself from loss, by insurance. Thus when°a mill
or factory is burned down, or swept away by a broken dam,

72 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

the owners may receive its full value from an insurance com-
pany; they may use this money to rebuild their factory, and
thus give temporary employment to a large number of men;
and to a superﬁcial View the loss might appear a gain. But
you must see that, first, the operatives stand idle while the
mill is rebuilding: or if they seek employment elsewhere, do
so at a loss to themselves by the cost of removal, and at a loss

to others of their own class by increasing the supply of their

kind of labor at the very time that the demand is diminished;
and, second, the old mill rebuilt will only give employment to
its former operatives, while if the mill had not been destroyed,
the capital used in rebuilding it would have been available for
a new mill or other enterprise, which would have given em-
ployment to an additional number of hands. _

205. Thus you see that destruction of capital works to the

A injury of the non—capitalist class; and that the Chicago ﬁre,

though it gave employment for a time to a multitude of car-

penters, masons, bricklayers, and others, and caused an artiﬁcial

and seeming prosperity in that place, was a loss to the mass of
our population, because in fact it lessened the capital,'surplus,
or wealth of the country, and thereby impaired the means of
giving employment all over the land. The Boston and Chi-
cago ﬁres were followed by a general stagnation in business
all over the country, because capital which would have been
used in other enterprises and expenditures, and consequently
in the payment of wages for other and new production, was
concentrated in Boston and Chicago, and used to repair waste

~ and losses: to replace what had been destroyed.

206. But an unproﬁtable enterprise is just as much a de-
struction of capital as a ﬁre; and if I should hire you for a
year to carry bricks from one side of a road to the other and
back, though you might in the mean time live from your
wages, I should have sunk my capital, and the mass of the la-

borers in the community would have suﬁered a loss, because,

there would be less capital out of which to pay wages.
207. Thus you see that credit, which is onlycapital in an-
other shape, can not be misused without inﬂicting a loss on the

or BANK-NOTES. 7 3

Whole community, and especially‘ on the laborers for wages.
And you see how foolish are the people who would like to have
the government borrow vast sums of money to be expended in
what are called “public Works,” of doubtful and certainly not
established utility; for if it were certain that a new canal or
railroad or other so—called “improvement” would be proﬁtable,
private capital Would quickly create it. The plea is that such
projects would give employment to great numbers of men.
But if they are employed in unproﬁtable enterprises, they and
the mass of laborers are in the end injured by the loss of capi-
tal, which involves a decreased fund out of which wages may
be paid. r

XXIV.
027* BANK-N.0 ms.

208. Besides receiving money. on deposit, and lending it out
on security, which is their proper and legitimate business, banks
sometimes issue notes or bills of their own. '

209. This is a peculiarly proﬁtable business: for a bank—bill
bears no interest; it is liable to be destroyed by ﬁre or water;
it is likely to remain out for a considerable period—indeed, is-
sue—banks often take pains to cause their bills to be circulated
at a great distance from the bank in order to keep them out
the longer; and, ﬁnally, as the bank—bill becomes a medium of
exchange, the people are in a manner compelled to accept it.
But if a bank fails, the laborers for Wages, the non-capitalists,
are sure to suﬁer most of the loss which occurs from the de-
preciation of the bills. A bank note or bill has therefore
some of the features of a forced loan by the bank from the
public.

210. In the United States We have been so long accustomed
to see the issue of bills made the most conspicuous business

‘of a bank, that in the common apprehension a bank is synon-

ymous with apaper-mill, a machine to create shin-plasters, and
to suspend specie payments Whenever, by granting unwise

74 ‘POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

credit and imprudent loans, it has helped to create a commer-
cial revulsion. .

211. I want you, ‘therefore, to ﬁx in your mind the fact that
the issue of bills is not a necessary, and hardly a legitimate
part of the banking business; that the most solid and also the
most proﬁtable banks in the world do not issue notes at all;
and that bank—notes, though a convenience, are not absolutely
necessary to any people. California, for instance, had in 187 3
a number of remarkably solid, useful, and proﬁtable banks, but
it had only two banks of issue; and as it might have had
many more, their absence is a proof that they were not needed.

212. A bank-note is not money; on the contrary, it is only
Ct promise to pay money. It is one of several kinds of promises
to pay; and diﬁers from the others mainly in these particulars
-—that it bears no interest, and that the holder has no security
in his own hands.

213. If you have in your pocket a twenty—dollar gold—piece,i

you have actually in your possession that much value. But if

. you have in your pocket a bank—note for twenty dollars, you

have only a certiﬁcate that a bank, which may be a thousand

miles distant, and of whose managers you know nothing, has ’

your twenty dollars.

214. Now, if you wished to carry about with you two or
three hundred, or even one hundred dollars, itwould obviously
be more convenient to carry bank—notes to that amount than
money; for the paper bills are lighter than coin, and more
easily concealed from thieves.

215. This convenience of carriage and concealment is the.

only excuse for the existence of bank—bills, and it is a sufficient
excuse where men need to carry about considerable sums.
But a laboring man, whose whole wages for a Week amount per-
haps toless than twenty dollars, and- who pays out the greater
part of this sum at once for subsistence, is not inconvenienced
by the weight. of his money. He does not need bank—bills;
and there is no need for small bills to accommodate him.
Small bills, of less denominations than ﬁve dollars, are in some
respects a convenience; but their use drives coin out of circu«

or BANK-NOTES. . 7 5

lation, and so does an injury, in a time of commercial panic,
by helping to cripple the banks. Moreover, the poor, who are
usually the holders of small bills, in a time of bank failures are
sure to suﬁer loss from such bills; and it is not fair that they
should be thus exposed. I

216. For these reasons the issue of bank—bills for sums smaller
than ﬁve dollars ought to be totally prolmlbited.

217. A bank—note, being only a certiﬁcate that the bank has
the bill-holder’s money, may be accepted as a public conven-

ience, if the public is willing; but as every man has a right to

his own property at all times, it is clear that the bank has no
right to refuse me money—which is mine—-whenever I present
its bill. You may for your own convenience allow the bank
to keep your twenty—dollar ,gold—piece ;; but you ought to have
the power to call the money back into your own possession at
any time; for if you could not do that, you would keep your
money and refuse the bill. 4

218. Hence bank—notes can not be made a legal tender, be-
cause they are not money, but only the certiﬁcates showing that
somebody else has your money; and they ought always to be
redeemable at will in coin, which alone is money.

219. Wlien a bank issues notes or bills, its object is to gain
money byborrowing without interest, of the general public.
If it issues one hundred thousand dollars in bills, that implies
that it holds one hundred thousand dollars in money in its
vaults or till, ready to redeem these bills. In practice, however,
banks do not keep‘so much money idle; they keep on hand
only such a smaller sum» as general experience has shown to he
usually sufficient for redemption. But experience has also
shown that all bankers are not prudent or wise; and hence
the government now rightlyrequires that a bank, before it is-
sues bills or notes, shall deposit a sum in property at all times
readily convertible into coin, which shall be held for the re-—
demption of the bills. United States bonds, which are tlie
best security we have, and most readily convertible into money,
are used for this purpose.

220. ‘With the management of banks which conﬁne thenie

76 POLITICS ron rouse AMERICANS.

selves to the business of receiving deposits and making loans
the government has no right to interfere-—any' more than it
does w-ith the business of a merchant, farmer, or shopkeeper.
For I have no more right to expect the government to care for
the safe-keeping of my money than of my goods in store, my
house, or other property. «

221. Banks of issue, however, stand in a different category.
They exercise a power over the public so great and so liable
to abuse,in the privilege granted them to issue non—interest-
bearing notes, without security inthe holders’ hands, things
which take the place of money, that the people have a right
to demand that such issues shall be made only under rigid
checks. V '

222. It is proper, therefore, that the government shall require
the deposit of United States bonds to an amount greater than
the amount of bills issued.» Should the bank fail, these bonds
would be sold by the government, and out of the proceeds the
bill—holders would be paid ﬁrst. Under this, which is called
the National Banking System, the bill—holders are secure against
loss by failure of the bank; and there is no doubt that this
system is more secure, and of greater public convenience than
any system of state banks. It was first applied by the State
of New York to its own banks; and Secretary Chase, seeing
its merits, applied it to the whole country.

223. With this ought to go a law rigidly requiring the banks
at all.times to redeem their bills‘ in money; and providing for
the instant forfeit of a bank’s charter the moment it refuses
this, its primary duty. Unfortunately, hitherto in this country

"banks have been allowed to suspend specie payments in every

great commercial panic; and as they long ago learned tocount
upon this, they were induced, by -the security of exemption
from punishment, to make imprudent loans, and for their own
gains to help on the coming crisis.

‘ 224. But with a sufficient deposit of bonds in the Treasury,
a prohibition against small bills, and rigid punishment for a
suspension of specie payments, there is no sound reason why
any ‘one who desires should not be allowed to set up as barn/e of

or BANK-NOTES;  7 7

issue, in any part of. the country. If they become too numer-

ous, they- will cease to be proﬁtable, for the bills will be sent’

home for redemption too constantly, and the superﬂuous banks
Will wind up their aﬁairs.

225. You will see by this the folly of the debates in Con-
gress about regulating the number of banks of issue, and their
distribution over the country-——as though, when national bank-
bills circulate with equal credit in every part of the United
States, it could make any diﬁerence Where the banks happened
to be placed. -

226. Also you will see the ignorance of those who cry out
against national banks as monopolies, making huge proﬁts out
of the people. That this is the rankest of follies will be plain
to you if you remember that a bank-note is used only as a con-
venience by the people; and that, under proper regulations
promptly enforced, banks of issue are a real and important con-
venience; While banks of deposit and credit are, as you have
seen, of the greatest and most positive advantage to the mass
of laborers for Wages. « i i

227. If those who oppose banks would demand a resump-
tion of specie payments by the banks, they would do the coun-

try a real and very great service; but insteadof that they cry

for “ more greenbacks,” about which I will next proceed to tell
you something. But I must first explain to you that, under
the present currency system, the national banks are obliged by
law to redeem their notes, not in money, but in greenbacks;

. which means that they exchange their own for the govern-

ment’s irredeemable promise to. pay money. If two Wrongs
ever made a right, this plan might have some merit. It would
be better, because simpler, to absolve the banks from redemp-
tion of any kind for a speciﬁed time; and thus separate their
currency from that of the government. Then they would at
least prepare themselves for resumption, which now they do
not. At present every attempt to Withdraw greenbacks from
circulation—the ﬁrst duty of the government, if it ishonest———
threatens and alarms the banks, who see the power of redeem-
ing their notes lessened, and themselves fatally embarrassed;

78 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

and thus, while we keep up the absurd farce of making the

banks redeem their notes in greenbacks—which means only
that we exchange one irredeemable promise to pay for another
———we force them to oppose with all their strength all attempts
by the government to redeem and withdraw its greenbacks;
and in fact oblige the banks to lend their countenance, openly
or secretly, to every movement for “more greenbacks.” For
obviously, if the issue of these government notes could be
doubled, the banks would ﬁnd it easier and cheaper to redeem
their notes in them.

XXV.
on £4 MOBE GREENBA arcs.”

228. A Greenback is a non—interest—bearing promise to pay
money, issued by the government, and for whose redemption
the holder has no security in his own hands. It is, sofar, pre-
cisely like a bank—note; but it has two features which make it
diﬁer from a common bank—note: you can not sue the issuer
of the note——the government, namely—and that has used its
power to make it a legal tender. A bank—note, as you saw a
while back, has some of the features of a forced loan; the
greenback has all—it is a forced loan. If I should compel
you to give me your dollars in exchange for a piece of paper
on which I had written simply “ I O U” so much, that would
be a forced loan—you would probably call it a robbery: and

that is precisely what the government did when it issued ir-

redeemable promises to pay, and made them a legal tender.
229. If a banker issues one hundred thousand dollars in

bills, that is evidence that he is the owner of one hundred

thousand dollars in money or other property, which—or, more

correctly, one hundred and ten thousand dollars—he has de—'

posited in the Treasury as security that he will redeem his
notes on demand.-
280. If new a banker were to set up a claim to issue one

or "“ MORE eREEN.13.A_eKs.”“§ t 79

hundred thousand dollars in bills, on the plea that he had no
money or projaerty at all with which to redeem them, he would
be rightly thought insane; and if he persisted in such an ab-
surdity, he would be sent by his friends to the lunatic asylum.
If he should demand, besides, that these bills which he desires
to issue should be declared a legal tender, no doubt he would
be put into a strait—jacket, or sent to the incurable ward, and

_ the lowest attendant in the asylum would laugh at him as an

absurd creature‘. _

231. But this is precisely what the government does in
issuing greenbaeks. It issues promises to pay, on the plea that
it has no money ; and it makes them a legal tender because
they are not good. For if they were good, it would not need
to force us to accept them, which is the only object of the
legal—tender clause ; and if the government had money, it could-
have no excuse or occasion for issuing notes.

“ 232. For you must not forget, what was shown you under
the head of Taxes, that a government can "earn or create noth-
ing; it is not a producer. Again, you saw, under the head»
of Moiiey, that when the government coins money it does not
create gold or silver; nor does it add to their value by coining‘

. them; it does not even own the metal it coins; but only, for

the general convenience, stamps your or my or John Smith’s
gold with its certiﬁcate that each piece contains a speciﬁed
quantity of the metal.~ '3

233. This service plainly gives it no right todeclare any

thing else money; but if it did, it would be you or I or John

Smith, and not the government itself, who Would have the‘

right to carry iron or paper to the mint to be stamped.
234. Nor does its authority to declare the gold it stamps a‘
legal tender give it power to make any thing——even gold—a

  legal tender for more than its actual and real value. For in.

all this it creates nothing: it only exercises a power delegated
to it for the general convenience, to make public declaration‘
of a value already existing.

235. Let me repeat to you once more that a government
has no power to create value in anyway or sense; for it does.

none of the things out of Which,We have seen before, value
grows: it neither proditces, nor exchanges, nor saves ,' it only
expends or destroys. Whatever is given to it by society. It is,
in fact, like a pauper; for, like 03 pauper, it exists by the con-
tributions of others ,' and as it can have no surplus, but neces-
sarily lives from hand to mouth, and by the labor of others, a
pauper might as Well put out demand notes as a government;
for the bills of each would represent, not existing values, but
values destroyed and extinct, and therefore not values at all, but
nothing. If you will reflect that in order to call in and redeem
the greenbaclzs the government would have to ﬁrst raise money
by taxes——or by what is in the 1 long run the same thing, by
sales of bonds——you will see that the greenback is simply a
certiﬁcate that the government has actually spent and destroy-
ed that much property; and that, as before said, it represents,
not value existing, but value extinct, which is nothing. I

236. You will see by this the extraordinary hallucination of
those people who cry out for “more greenbacks.” In a time
of War, When the expenditures of the government enormously
exceeded the largest sum it could raise from taxes, it was au-
thorized to borrow money. It borrowed many hundreds of

millions, upon bonds, or obligations promising to repay the r

lenders at a certain time, with interest at a stipulated rate. A This
Was perfectly legitimate and honest. But, by a singular_blun-
der, the government also chose to borrow money by a forced
loan from its citizens, for which it gave, not interest—bearing
bonds, but notes promising to pay, but neither stipulating time
of repayment nor granting interest for the use of the money.
Such _a note made by an individual would be void; made by
the government, it was tolerated, on the express ground that
the government needed vast sums for its current expenditures,
andmust get money Where and in whatever way it could.
237. But circumstances have changed. The taxes now
equal the expenditures, and there is an annual surplus even.
How then can We have “More greenbacl:s?”, On What ex-
cuse, in what Way, for what purpose, can the government
borrow money ? VVl1at shall it do with the money for which

it is to issue “ more greenbacks ?” The “more greenback”

‘ people seem to have perceived this dilemma, and to meet it

they have begun to urge a great system of “public Works ”

we are to run in debt‘ for these, surely. it is better to do so
honestly, by selling our bonds, than dishonestly, by increasing
the amount of a forced loan which ought long ago to have
been paid out of the surplus revenue, instead of redeeming
bonds not yet due. .

V 238. You have seen, under the head of Property, that the
surplus, or that part of his product not needed by the pro-
ducer for his own consumption, has no real value, and can
not become wealth or capital unless he can exchange it for
something else. . _ s .

239. It is not less true that the value of the surplus grows
in the precise measure in which the facility of exchanging it is
increased. '

240. The Nebraska farmer, unable to get his corn to mar-

Railroads have extended their market for selling eggs.

for lack of cheap transportation, eggs Were Very cheap in

scarcity. _

242. Pray ﬁx in your mind therefore this fundamental
truth, that every impediment to the exchange of products
is an injury ,' and that every removal of such an impediment
is a benefit, because it increases the rewards of the mass of
producers, and the al)undance, and hence the comfort and hap-
piness of the mass of consumers.

243. Hence the satisfactionwith which people Welcome
railroads; the beneﬁt of steamboats, steamships, bridges, and
all other means by which We decrease the cost of transporta-
tion. For you can see that if a farmer can send his eggs to
only oneiplace, Cincinnati, Where men Want to buy -eggs, he
can not hope to get as much for them as if he _could—with
cheap transportation——send them to any one of a dozen cities.
And as he ‘would send his eggs only to places Where they
would bring a higher price—Where therefore eggs Were scarce
—cheap transportation, by creating abundance in those places,
would beneﬁt consumers -there. .

244. Commerce means the exchange of products. -If I

have more hides than I need, and you have more clothing '

than you need, and if I Want clothing and you hides, it is
plain that We shall make an exchange of our surpluses if We
can get together and agree upon a price. It is clear, too,
that we shall both benefit by such an eaﬁchange, because when
it is made, each of us will have less of the articles which he
could not use, and more of those which he wanted.

or 'C'O'MMER'OE2 ‘ 83

, _245. Moreover, you can see that it would be an advantage
to you, having clothing to exchange for hides, if you could
ﬁnd, not me alone, but a hundred others, with surplus hides to
exchange for clothing, because you would hope thus to get
more hides for your clothing. It would be an equal advan-

. tage forme if I were the only possessor of hides within the

reach of a hundred men having clothing to exchange. But,

evidently, all the owners of surplus hides would be beneﬁted

if they could come in contact with all the possessorsl of sur-

plus clothing—because thus the market of all would be broad?‘

ened, and the price would be equalized for the mass.

246. Thus you see that unimpeded commerce is a beneﬁt-
to the mass of producers; and that every impediment pre-
venting a part of the owners of surplus clothing from reach-

ing a market of hides, while it may be an advantage to the-"
few who do reach it, and who would thus have a monopoly,

Would be an injury, ﬁrst, to those who were prevented from
reaching it; but, second, and more important, to the whole
of those who were anxious to exchange hides for clothing.

247. Every impediment to free exchange, tlterefore, w/tether’

natural or artiﬁcial, is an injury to the mass of consmners—
who are the whole people.

248. Nevertheless, every act of exchange which takes place,
even where a close monopoly exists on one side, or in regard
to one product, is stillan unmixed beneﬁt, for it increases
abundance and comfort, though in a less measure than if the
monopoly did not impede free exchange; and thus it would
be. wrong to say that men, under any circumstances, become
poorer by voluntary exchange. It is, however, quite certain
that capital increases far more slowly where impediments exist

jto a free exchange of surplus products.

249. Impediments to the exchange of products are either
natural or artiﬁcial. The natural obstacles are very numerous,
but may be comprised under the general head of distance.
A river is a serious impediment to commerce, until it is
bridged or a ferry-boat crosses it; an ocean is a greater im-
pediment, and can be overcome only with the helpiof ships.

84 POLITICS FOR ‘YOUNG ~ AMERICANS.

Differences in language .and habits are natural impediments.
Providence, which placed natural impediments in theway of
the exchange of products, gave to different and distant parts
of the earth different climates, soils, and capacities for pro-
duction, so that what is produced in one country is needed
in many others; and every part of the earth is ﬁtted to
produce something which is desired by the people of other
parts. -I ,  . I
250. You will quickly see the Wisdom of the Creator in
this, for it compels mankind to intercourse with each other;
and commerce is thus one of the main agents in spreading
civilization over the World, in bringing men and nations to-
gether in a humane and brotherly spirit; in subduing bar~
barism, preserving the peace, and in increasing constantly
the area over which industry and self—denial are rewarded,
property is made secure_, and- civilization becomes possible.
251. Imagine anation which was so favored by climate
and soil that it could and did produce Within its bounds all
and every thing that its members required, and you will see
that such a nation would soon cease to have any inﬂuence
upon the outer World———for good at least; it would become
selﬁsh; would scorn, because it did not need, commerce;
would lose the immense advantage of intercourse with other
nations ; and, having no such commerce or intercourse, would
presently contract vices, such‘ as ignorance, superstition, con-
tempt of foreigners, and disregard of. justice, which would de-

grade its civilization. But imagine the earth divided among '

nations, each sufficient to itself, and you will see Africa or
Greenland reproduced all over the planet.

252. Moreover, God, whose design iI1 surrounding our lives
With difficulties evidently was to force us to exercise ingenu-
ity, courage, persistence, patience, daring, and enterprise—all
those which We call manly virtues—had this in View also in
creating impediments, to intercourse between men in distant
parts of the earth, but at the same time making such i—nter—
course, for the purpose of exchanging products, absolutely
essential to our comfort and highest v/vell—being; and “im-=

polling us therefore, by the most powerful motives, to over-
come the impediments he has created; andmaking us feel
that we are the higher and the better, as well as the wealthier
arid more comfortable beings, in the measure that we do over-
come them. There is no doubt that the character of the
whole Chinese nation has been degraded by their long—con—

 tinued abstinence from foreign commerce, and their conse-

quentwseclusion from other nations. Had they during the
many centuries of this seclusion been actively engaged in

-foreign commerce, it is certain they would have been less

selﬁsh, less ignorant, less superstitious, more courageous and
enterprising, and more truthful and just, than as a nation
they now are-

253. Artiﬁcial obstacles to exchange arise out of laws, which

-either prohibit exchange with foreigners entirely, as formerly

in Japan, or lay a penalty on such exchange, as regards certain
products: this is still done in many‘ countries, among them
our own. i

254. All such artiﬁcial restrictions are impolitic, injurious,
and, unless all commerce is prohibited, necessarily partial and
unjust. A

‘ 255. It is possible to imagine anation like the Japanese de-
termining for religious or other reasons to seclude themselves
entirely from the world; and therefore totally prohibiting
commercial as well as other intercourse with foreigners. In
such a case the whole people accept less abundance, and deny
themselves comforts and luxuries which they can not them-
selves produce. All are injured, all suﬁer loss and depriva-
tion; and if injustice is done, it is by all to all.

256. But among civilized nations, like our own, the pro-
hibitions and penalties on foreign exchange are nowhere of
this character; they are always partial—being laid only upon
a few articles; and thus an essential injustice is done to those
who would, if they were allowed, exchange their products.for
those articles which are forbidden them, or who must paya
penalty for such exchange. For instance, if I am a farmer,
who need to exchange my surplus wheat for clothing, it is an

86 POLITICS FOR YOUNG‘A-MERICATNS. I

injustice tome if the law forbids me to make this exchange

wherever I may choose; for, as We have seen, if by any imped-
iment it narrows my market, it lowers my proﬁt. I may be
able to get more cloth for my wheat in Germany than in my
own neighborhood: a lav; which makes me pay a penalty for
doing so is clearly partial and unjust. Or I may be a black-
smith, and prefer Swedish bars for my horse—shoes; Why
should you, who make American bars, urge a law to make me
pay a penalty for my preference? *

257. Fix in your mind that Commerce is not a swindling
transaction, but a purely beneﬁcial operation ,' that every act
of honest trade increases the happiness and prosperity of all

who are concerned in it ,' that when We two exchange products,‘

each is the more comfortable and the better oﬁ for the ex-

change—for each has given that which he Wanted less for that»

Which he Wanted more. .

258. God, who placed natural obstacles in the Way of free
exchange, has yet made it lauclable and beneﬁcial in us to use
all our strength and ingenuity in overcoming these impediments
which he has placed in the Way of the freest and widest ex-
change‘ of commodities.

. 259. When, therefore, human governments interfere by

laws (which while they exist it is our cluty to obey) to obstruct?
such exchange, they arrogate to themselves authority greater‘
than that assumed by the Creator, and do an injury, moral as

Well as physical, to all who are subject to such laws.
260. Property, as you have before seen, originates in three
acts: labor, self-denial, and exchange. A law which should

forbid men to labor, or limit their right to labor except in-

prescribed Ways and hours, ought to be resisted by all sensible
men as an unjust interference. A law which should limit the
right of self-denial——or compel me to spend my accumulations
as fast as I created them, would be no less unjust and_mon—
strous. But a law which interferes with my right to exchange
my surplus where I like is only more endurable to us because
We are accustomed to,it. It does not diﬁer in principle; and
how potent custom is in making us tolerant of unjust laws We

or COMMERCE. 87

already see in the ease with which men submit to trades-union
regulations limiting the duration and tl1e manner of men’s ‘la-
boring. ‘

261. Nor is it strange that the trades—unions, who interfere
with the right of a man to labor when, where, or how he likes,
favor also the enactment of laws unjustly and in a partial man-
ner impeding the exchange of products or commerce. Their
course, in this respect, is logical. They abhor abundance, and
make scarcity their god. ' I

262. The most magniﬁcent and conclusive example of the
beneﬁts of unobstructed commerce is afforded by our own
country.’ The Constitution of the United States provides
carefully for the most entire and unobstructed freedom in the
interchange of products over the greater and the -most fertile
part of the American continent, and among thirty—seven differ
ent political communities; and no one doubts that it is to this

absolute freedom of exchange, guarded with the utmost jeal-

ousy against every exaction and interference, that we owe our
wonderful advance in wealth, as well as in the ingenuity and
intelligence of our people. Consider what must’ have been
our condition had Virginia been allowed to lay restrictions and
penalties on commercial intercourse with Pennsylvania, or New
York to interfere with her citizens when they sought to ex-
change products with Massachusetts, or the North with the
South, or the East with the West, as was done under the Con-

’ federation.

263. Yet if any such interference is beneﬁcial, it would seem
to be more necessary to protect the West against New En-
gland than against Europe; or the South against the North
than against England and France. For, the plea for such in-

' terference being that it is necessary to enable the establishment

of manufactures at home, and to maintain a high rate of wages,
it is clear that Michigan or Georgia manufactures, for instance,
can be more easily undersold by Massachusetts or New York
than by English or German manufacturers, .Wl1O must carry
their goods so much farther to market, and must also draw
their raw. materials from a greater distance; and an iron-mas

88 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

ter in Indiana or Missouri would feel the competition of his
Pennsylvania or New Jersey rival far more keenly than that
of an Englishman, who must send his iron three thousand
miles farther to market. Yet the Weste1'n and Southern
manufacturers make no complaintof suchhome competition.

264. The Southern leaders were more logical. They wished
to destroy the Union because they imagined that thus they
could set up home manufactures in the Southern States; and
their attempt was really, and in many cases avowedly, a pro-
tectionist measure; an intentional and deliberate interference
with the free exchange of products. . . -

265. You must understand, however, that the people of the

"United States have long and deliberately consented to a- policy

in regard to external commerce which I have shown you to
be injurious to the general welfare. No political party is yet
united in demanding that the people shall be guaranteed the
right of free exchange. Nor can it be doubted that the Con-
gress has. power to lay duties discriminating in favor of some
branches of industry—and of course against others; for it is
the essence, of such discrimination that it shall injure some in
order to beneﬁt others. This is one of the great battle—grounds
of opinion in the United States; and as many large individual
interests are arrangedin favor of such discrimination, and as
the masses who are injured have not the means for as compact
an organization as the few whom self—interest guides, it -is
probable that we shall see protective tariﬁs for many years
cumbering our statute—bool:s, and lessening the general pros-
perity. '

266. When the Constitution‘ was adopted, most statesmen
still believed that a country needed such interference with the
free exchange of products, to enable the establishment of home
manufactures; hence the power given to Congress to “regu-
late commerce,” which undoubtedly means and has always
been held to imply the power to interfere with exchange, not
merely for purposes of revenue, but for the object of “protect-
ing,” as it is called, home manufacturers. The first tariff or
scale of external duties enacted by Congress had this object in

c or DIVERSITY -or INDUSTRIES. 89

view; and though unjust, partial, and impolitic, there is no
doubt that Congress has the constitutional right thus to de-
range industry by partial laws. _ ..

267. One plea.on which protective tariffs, as -such interfer-
ences are called, have been justiﬁed, is that thus only can we
have diversiﬁed industries. If this were true, it would really
justify the protectionist system—for diversiﬁed industries are
a great beneﬁt to arnation. But in the next section I shall
show you that so far from favoring a diversity of industries,
protective tariffs have really, in our country, discouraged and
destroyedmany small industries, and created a powerful and
to the people irresistible tendency of both capital and labor
toward a few great industries. » .

268. That nation or people is happiest which has the most
widely diversiﬁed industries ; because its members will be led
inevitably to the exercise of great and varied ingenuity and
enterprise, while at the same time capital, the fruit and re-

ward of labor, will be more equally distributed among the ‘

population than in a country where but a few industries are
pursued.

269. Take, for instance, a region devoted to grazing, orto
the cultivation of cotton only, and you will ﬁnd the mass of
the people dull and subordinate, and the wealth in few
hands. In like manner examine a district devoted mainly to
the production of crude iron, coal, or cotton fabrics, and you
will ﬁnd the mass of the people subordinate, in poor circum-
stances, comparatively ignorant and unenterprising, and not

ingenious, while the greater part of the wealth of the com-

munity is concentrated in a few hands.

more equally divided, comfort more widely diffused, and the
people more enterprising, intelligent, ingenious, and inde-
pendent. '

271. To contrive a system of laws, therefore, whose tend-
ency and eﬁect would be to drawvlarge numbers from the
smaller industries which they would naturally pursue, and
concentrate their labors upon a single pursuit, would be to
degrade the character of such a population, by making it less
ingenious, enterprising, and independent than before; and
this the more if this single industry should be‘ of a kind
which required, in the mass of those engaged in it, but little
skill or thought, and at the same time required that much
capital should be devoted to -it. For in that case no.t only
would the character of" the people deteriorate, but wealth
would more and -more be drawn away from "the smaller in-
dustries, and concentrated in. the larger, and the mass of the
people would become in time less prosperous and comfortable.

272. Now this grave injury has been done to .._large classes
of our population by what is wrongly called the system of
.‘~‘-Protection’ to Izrome I7zdust7"g/,” which is simply a11 interfer-
ence with the right of free exchange. l

273. To comprehend how “Protective” laws, so called, de-
grade home industry, and prevent diversity of industries, 1
must ﬁrst explain to you the natural progress of industry in
any country——that course which the Creator has laid out by
what are called Natural Laws.

274. V\7hen a new country begins to receive population,

men being scarce and land abundant, it is inevitable that wise’
men will turn to industries which require for their prosecu-

tion the least amount of labor, because the rate of wages will
be high, laborers being few. Hence in our new territories
grazing is at first a favorite and proﬁtable occupation. As
population increas.es,_lands rise in price, and farming is begun;
and presently villages make‘ their appearance, where black-
smiths, carpenters, masons, wagon—makers, and shopkeepers
gather, to supply the farmers’. needs, and afford him for at

least a part of his surplusuproducts a nearmarket. Capital.

or DIVERSITY or INDUSTRIES. ' 91

or surplus rapidly increases in a new country; as population
continues to stream in, new industries are devised, and the
region which at ﬁrst imported every thing except its meat
becomes more and more self—sustaining; for capital, intelli-
gently directed, spies out the wants of the people and the
natural resources and advantages of the land; and it is not
long before even some articles of manufacture begin to be
exported to neighboring districts.

275. By this time roads and perhaps railroads have been
built, and, by lessening the cost of transportation and in-

creasing production, the cost of living has been greatly’

cheapened; new enterprises no longer offer .such great re-
wards as at ﬁrst to capital, and the rate of interest has
consequently fallen ; (increasing population has lowered the
rate of wages——-without, however, necessarily lessening che
comfort of the laborers, for all prices arealso less, as you
have seen. Finally, there is a numerous class of hired labor-
ers, whereas in the beginning almost every, man was his own
employer. At this stage what we call manufactures naturally
arise. Capital, seeking new means of profitable employment,
provides machinery, raw material, and wages, for the use of
laborers also seeking new ways to earn a living. -

27 6. This is the natural course of a country’s industries
where arbitrary and partial laws are not used to force both
capital and labor out of the channels Nature has provided.
In this natural developmentthe ingenuity and enterprise of
the people have constant exercise; capital is for a long time.
pretty equally diffused, because there will be a_ great and in-
creasing diversity of small industries; the character of the
population will be high, its independence great, and pros
perity will be general. The greater operations of industry,
which require extreme concentration of both capital and
labor, will be long deferred, until at last the country’s natural
resources are fully explored, and the accumulation of wealth

and the increase of population are both so great as to lead

naturally and safely to such employment for both. The
stages of development in such a case will be slow, but sure,

92 POLITICS FOR YOUNG. AMERICANS.

and there will be no great crisis or panic, nor any marked
lowering of the condition of the people. Their ingenuity
and desire for prosperity would lead them to devise new in-

dustries and control new enterprises as fast as capital and

labor offered to prosecute. them; and it is an important con-
sideration that these new enterprises would grow naturally
out of the conditions of the country, as to climate and pro-
ductions, and the wants of the people. - .

27 7. Unfortunately this natural and sound growth is not
permitted. Diﬁerent motives, among which are national
pride, a desire for more showy production, the subtle fallacy
of a “home market,” so called, but mainly the greed for
wealth and supremacy in individuals, unite to bring about
the adoption of unjust and partial laws, enacted to favor
some special branch of industry. These laws, under the be-
guiling name of “Protection to Home Industry,” layheavy
duties on a few foreign products, in order to enable those
who p_roduce these articles at home to. charge a higher price
for them, and to give them the command of’ the home mar-
ket—which means only, as must be plain toyou, to compel
the mass of the people to buy of the favored. individuals at a
higher price than they could, but for these laws, buy_for else-
where; in other words, to impede the free exchange of prod-
ucts. . _-

27 8. For instance, New England capitalists——helped,— I be-
lieve, originally by some Southern men——began to clamor for
duties on foreign—made cotton goods; and, contrary to the

wish of the ﬁrst promoters of cotton manufactures, a high _

duty was put on the importation of foreign calicoes, sheet-
ings, and other manufactures of cotton.

27 9. Of course, a duty on the foreign product is a bounty
on the home product. The home manufacturer raises his
price to the price at which the foreigner can sell after he has
paid the duty. A duty on calicoes, therefore, confessedly
makes calico—the home as well as the foreign product——
dearer than it would otherwise be; and all who wear calico
——all the women and children in the land, that is to say-—

or DIVERSITY on INDUSTRIES. 93

must pay more for their dresses, in order that the insigniﬁ-
cant number engaged in making calicoes at home shall obtain
their bounty. A

280. N ow it has never been pretended that the people o
New England were starving when a duty was laid on calicoes
and other cotton goods. They were, according to all ac-
counts, an extremely industrious and ingenious people, en-
gaged in such a multitude of small enterprises that “Yankee
Notions” was the generic name of a great class of small in-
ventions and products, all useful to mankind. Capital was
widely dispersed in these petty industries, for wh.ich the char-
acter of the country a11d its inhabitants was well ﬁtted ; large
fortunes were few, and not easily accumulated, but the aver-
age of comfort, intelligence, and public spirit was uncommon-
ly high.
T 281. The effect of the protective duty was, 1st, by offering
an unnaturally high reward to capital, to draw that away
from a number of the smaller industries, and concentrate it
in a few great buildings ﬁlled with costly machinery. 2d. To
draw away a large part of the laboring population from their
petty industries and their country homes into. large ‘manu-
facturing towns, and to employmentswhich made them more
dependent and less ingenious and self—helpful than before.

282. The life of a mill or factory operative being of a kind
offering few hopes of advancement, and a smaller chance of
independence than intelligent and enterprising people like
to submit to, the best class of the New England population
presently withdrew from it, or never entered it; but capital
——then not superabundant in the country—having been ‘di-
verted to manufacturing on a great scale by the “protective”
duty, was made less abundant for small enterprises. The
temptation of cheap and fertile lands then drew oﬁ the most
enterprising population to the Weste1'n States; and the Yan-
kee girls left the factories to ﬁll the vacant places of those
who had emigrated to the West.

283. The manufacturers, to ﬁll the gap, began systematic-
ally to import foreigners, mostly of a low grade of intelli-

94. POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

genes, and have continued to do this to the present time;
with results evident to the country in a gradual but serious
deterioration in the character of the population, the corrup~
tion of politics, the increase of vice, crime, and ignorance.

284. To bring about these evils the women and children of
the United States were compelled to pay tribute, during a
great many years, every time they bought a new calico dress
or a yard of muslin. Meantime this “protection to home in-’
dustry,” or favoritism to a few at the cost of the great mass,
has built up a few very great fortunes, and a large population,
subject, ignorant, to a large extent the easy prey of de1na—
gogues, and in every way inferior to that it superseded; the
average of comfort and prosperity in New England is much
lower than itwas before “Protection ;” and pauperism has
greatly increased.

285. You see here that “Protection to Home Industry”
was a curse to people who were “protected,” at the same
time that it was unjust to that great mass of the population
which, not being engaged in cotton manufactures, was not
“protected,” but had to pay, in higher prices for clothing,
the cost of protection to a few. . A

286. Take now another case, where an attempt was made
to “protect” both the producers of a raw material andiits
manufacturers——of course once more at the expense of the
great mass of the people, who are consumers. The wool-
growers and the wool-manufacturers combined to appeal to
Congress for “protection,” and “encouragement for their
home industries ;” and their demands were granted. ' Natu-
rally both American wool and American woolen goods im-
mediately rose in price—that was the object of the men who
asked for the high duties._ Woolen shirts, trousers, coats,
blankets, carpets cost all of us more, in order that these two
home industries might be favored. .

287. The exclusion of foreign wool and woolens caused,
1st, a rapid and great increase in the production of American
wool, and also in the price of mutton——for the farmers, sure
of a high price for wool, would 11ot sell so many sheep to the

or DIVERSITY or INDUSTRIES.‘ *2 95

butchers as before. But mutton, too, is an article of univer-
sal consumption. 2d. The high duty caused the establisl1—
ment of a large number of woolen mills, with expensive
machinery, to build and work which capital was drawn from
other industries Where it was before usefully employed. At
the same time people were drawn from farms and other em~
ployments into the woolen mills. Thus, as in New England
in the previous case, industry was in a double way deranged.
288. But hardly had all the wool—growers and woolen man-
ufacturers got fairly to work when it was discovered that the
exclusion of foreign-grown woolfrom so large a market as
the United States had made it so cheap in Europe that n1anu—
facturers there could still sell their goods here, after paying
the high duty, in competition with ours in our own market.
Then followed a demand for still higher duties on the foreign
goods 2
289. But this additional protection for themselves enabled
our manufacturers to import some foreign—grown wool;
whereupon the wool—growers began to clamor: they had
greatly increased the product of wool——for sheep breed rapid-
ly; and as many had paid high prices for sheep, and for ﬁne
bucks, they did not like to lose the beneﬁt of protection.
  290. But it was reasonably urged by manufacturers that to
exclude foreign wools entirely was to conﬁne our manufact-
urers to making but few varieties of goods, and those not the
most proﬁtable, because for most kinds of goods the manu-
facturer needs ‘to mix in the looms the wools of different cli-
mates and countries. Hence the exclusion of foreign wool,
and an overstocked market in some kinds of goods, caused
the stoppage of many factories, a general stagnation of the
business—under the high duties, remember——consequent fall
in the demand for American wool, and prostration of the
protected wool—growers; all to the advantage of only a few
wealthy and cautious manufacturers, who happened to be
able to take advantage of the low prices. T
291. Here was a loss to farmers, manufacturers, and opera-
tives by “protection.” Nor was this all. Machinery lives

though men die. If it stands idle, it deteriorates; new in

-’ ventions supersede it by and by; and if it has stood idle, it 4

has not earned the "cost of replacement: hence actual loss of
much capital. As to the workmen, drawn away from other

and more healthful employments, and made more dependent

than formerly, many were now turned adrift.
292. To achieve these miserable results——_—to causeloss to
the farmers as well as to the manufacturers and their laborers,

I to derange an important’ industry, and beneﬁt only a few

speculators who were ready to take advantage of the general
loss—the whole American people were obliged by a partial
and unjust law to pay during several years needlessly high
prices for coats, trousers, blankets, carpets, ﬂannels,‘and wool-
en dresses. 4

298. Take yet another‘ example, diﬁering from the fore-
going——-the manufacture of crude and rolled iron, which in-
cludes pig and railroad and other bars. Laws placing a pen-
alty on the use of foreign iron have existed on our statute-»
books for a great number of years; they were adopted on
the plea that we possessed rich ores and abundant coal and
limestone; and that we could not safely be dependent on
foreign nations for so necessary an article as iron, because we
might in such a case be very seriously inconvenienced in the
case of war. I hope you are logician enough to see the fal-
lacy in this proposition—-—it lies in the implication that with"
out a penalty on the use of foreign iron, and a consequent
bounty to the home manufacturer, no American would have
engaged in this industry. But if, as is most true, we have
abundant supplies of excellent ores, fuel, and ﬁuxes—that is
to say, if "Nature has put us into an uncommonly advanta-
geous position for making iron, surely it is too much to say
that we could not or would not use these natural advantages
without an additional bounty from the government. .

294. The “protective” bounty, however, caused a rapid
flow of capital and labor from various other industries to this
crude pursuit——one of the lowest of all, the least elevating to
those engaged in it. The capital and labor were diverted

OF DIVERSITY OF INDUSTRIES. 

from industries naturally more productive, and this of course
put a serious loss upon the general community ; because thus
less aggregate wealth was produced, and the means of ex-
change were lessened. But, further, the hope of extraordi-
nary gains from protection-—which promised the iron—master
a monopoly of the home market—led men to rash ventures.
Many placed their iron-furnaces badly, so that they labored
under natural disadvantages, and needed protection, in fact,
not from European iron-masters, but from their more judi-
cious neighbors. I have been told by several iron—masters
that the furnace of the late Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsyl-
vania was thus misplaced, and that when he constantly ap-
pealed for a higher duty on foreign iron, for more, and more,
and more “protection,” he spoke from his own experience,
and for his own necessities, and not those of the judiciously
placed furnaces.

295. Another result of “ protection” was that the protected
iron-masters, even where the furnaces were well placed, often
neglected to apply the most scientiﬁc methods in their work.
They had become accustomed to depend on bounties and
“ protection” granted by the government, and no longer
used their brains, as they must have done had they, like the
shoemakers and blacksmiths and carpenters, the farmers, sew-
ing—Women, and the immense mass of unprotected laborers,
been obliged to depend upon their own ingenuity. Mr.
Abram Hewitt, of New Jersey, himself a prominent iron-
master and zealous protectionist, in a Report on Iron at the
last French Exhibition, reproached the American iron—masters
for this neglect, and pointed out that at that time many of
our works were conducted on methods long ago abandoned
in Europe as uneconomical. In another case an American,
visiting an English manufacturer of a specialty in woolen
goods, discovered that, in spite of our high tariff, he continued
to export his goods to the United States; and asking curi-
ously how it could be aﬁorded, the Englishman replied by
showing him that he had just put in an ’entire set of new and
greatly improved machinery, and had sold his old and waste-

ful machinery to a mamgfactm-er in the United States--to
his competitor, namely, Who depended not on ingenuity or
cheap means of production, but on “protection,” and no
doubt petitioned Congress for higher duties as soon as he had
set up the Englishman’s cast-off machines. Protection, you
see, dulls ingenuity, because it destroys a market for it. If
an American mechanic invents a machine for saving labor in
a “protected” industry, he has the less chance to proﬁt by
its adoption, because the capitalists to whom he oﬁers it de-

pend less on economy or ingenuity than on the government’s 4

bounty or protection, taken out of the people’s pockets.

296. The object of a duty on foreign iron is, of course, to
enable the American iron-master to charge a higher price for
his product. This addition to the natural price of iron must
be paid by the American people, for other nations will not
pay it—they will prefer to buy in a cheaper market, and thus
protection ruins our foreign commerce. But think for a min-
ute What an addition to the price of iron means. It means
that the carpenter shall pay more for his tools, the blacksmith
for -his horseshoes, the house-builder for his nails, the l1ouse-
keeper for her pots and kettles, the farmerfor his implements
———it means that houses shall be dearer and house-rent higher;
that all agricultural operations shall cost more, Wherefore
bread must be higher; that all machinery shall be more
costly, and therefore all clothing and other necessaries of life
produced by machinery shall be dearer to the poor; and, ﬁnal-
ly, that railroads, which use enormous quantities of iron in
rails, locomotives, and cars, shall be more costly, and therefore
freights higher forever to the farmer, Who Wants to get his
produce to market. 4

297. That is to say, a duty on iron takes something out of
the pocket of every man, Woman, and child in the United
States, and by that much lessens their comfort and prosperity;
and it does this, as you have seen, to make the fortunes of a
comparatively small number of capitalists engaged in the pro-
duction of iron, and to enable them, according to Mr.‘Hewitt,
to Work with wasteful means and processes.

or DIVERSITY on INDUSTRIES. ‘ 99

298. For the wor/omen do not beneﬁt by the tariﬁ’, but only
the capitalists. It is not pretended that the high duty obliges
or causes the iron—masters to pay their laborers wages above
the average standard of wages in the ‘country: the protection-
ists only claim that the high duty enables the payment of wages
in the protected industries equal to those paid in the unprotect-
ed. But those now engaged in thefurnaces and factories,
where they are crowded together, and rendered less intelligent,
less ingenious, less independent than the average of their coun-
trymen, would, if there had been no iron-furnaces at all, have
been engaged.in other and more healthful occupations; and
they are thus injured by the protective duty, by being lured
into the furnaces; and in the end are left without employ-
ment by a commercial" crisis in their trade, caused by over-
production, brought about entirely by the stimulant of bounty
or “protection.” The high duty on iron tempted capitalists
by the prospect of extraordinary proﬁts, and thus caused an
unnaturally rapid expansion of this business; with the result,
sure from the ﬁrst, of a general paralysis, involving loss of
capital, which is an indirect but certain loss to the mass of
laborers; but also, and directly, bringing suffering to the la-
borers engaged in the production of iron, and to their families.

299. You see, in these three instances, that—-1st. Protection
diverts capital from numerous diversiﬁed and naturally pro-

ductive into fewer and naturally less productive channels:

which is an injury to the mass of the people, because it checks
their enterprise and ingenuity. 2d. It diverts labor in the
same measure—for labor follows capital; and it places the
laborer always in a more dependent and precarious situation.
3d. It causes loss of capital, which is a serious injury to the
country, for capital is accumulated wealth, and one of the
most important tools for further increasing wealth. 4th.
Finally, it is a means of deranging industry, and thus sudden-
ly throwing great numbers of men out of employment. 5th.
And it does all this injury in a most costly manner, by a trib-
ute levied upon the whole population.

300. I might exhibit to you many other examples of the

100 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

folly and loss of “protection”——as the high duty on foreign
salt, which, 1st, destroyed some part of our foreign commerce,
where our ships were able to carry an outward cargo cheaply
only on condition of bringing home salt from Liverpool or
the West Indies; and, 2d, actually enabled a combination of
salt monopolists, two or three great companies, to close some
of the more important of our own salt—works, and thus lessen
the supply to the American people. I saw myself, a few
years ago, the great West Virginia Salt—works standing idle,
and when I asked the reason, was informed that the owners
were hired by the Associated Salt-Producers to close their
‘works (and of course to discharge all their workmen). This
is called “Protection to Home Industry.”

. 301. Again, a high duty was laid on foreign lumber and
timber; with the result, 1st, of breaking up an important
trade in ﬁnished lumber which our merchants had established
with Australia and the West Indies, but which was driven to
Canada by the tariﬁi which made lumber dear here; 2d, mak-
ing all houses dearer, and house—rents higher for the laboring
men and their families; and, 3d, causing the needless destruc-
tion ef our own forests, which we ought much rather to have
preserved with great care, so long as our neighbors would sell
us theirs.

802. I hope it is plain to you that all obstacles to the em-
ehange of products are injurious ; and that as God allows and
incites us to use our utmost ingenuity to lessen and overcome
those natural obstacles which he has placed, so it is the most
egregious folly in us to add artiﬁcial ones. In doing so, we
inevitably sink capital or accumulated wealth, and expose the
laboring part of the population to undue hazards, losses, and
suffering. '

303. Yet trades—unions and labor societies encourage this
system, miscalled “protection,” and thus show once morethe
folly which rules them, their ignorance of natural laws, and
their unﬁtness to undertake the control of labor.

304. For, bear in mind that—-1st. If there had never been
an iron-furnace, a cotton or woolen mill, in the whole United

or DIVERSITY or INDUSTRIES.   101

States, our population would still have been fully employed,

~ and at good wages. For our country is but thinly populated,

and with unobstructed production and exchange there will be
for a century to come a dozen days’ work for every man ready
to labor a day. 2d. Witliout “protection” we might have
had fewer cotton and woolen mills and iron-furnaces, but we
should have had a far more diversiﬁed industry; a more gen-
eral and equal distribution of wealth; more numerous oppor-
tunities for enterprising men of small means to use their in-
ventive skill in small businesses; and hence greater independ-
ence, and with this a higher average "of general intelligence,
thrift, and comfort than we have.

305. Protection drew our capital and labor into undertak-
ings which were not naturally proﬁtable (for else there would
have been no reason for protection); hence loss of capital or
wealth—-a lessening of the total amount of accumulated sav-
ings in the nation. But, as I showed you under the head of
Property, every loss of capital is an injury primarily to the
mass of those who labor for wages; secondarily to the whole
community. A

306. Moreover, protection, by offering the special tempta-
tion of a bounty to a few industries, and these of kinds in
which the laborers are on the whole least beneﬁted and made
most helpless, exposes these industries to over-production, and
thus causes commercial revulsions, stagnation in trade, and gen-
eral loss, with particular suffering to the laborers in the protect-
ed industries, who are at such times thrown out of employment;
and a general derangement of wages in all employments.

307. I have told you before that no merely selﬁsh policy
can in the long run prosper. God did not make the world so.
Unselﬁshness is as much a natural law as the law of gravita-
tion; and he who seeks to beneﬁt himself by injuring others
strives against nature, and though he may succeed in his direct
purpose, is sure in some other way to sustain greater injury.
And what is thus true of individuals is still more true of na-
tions, which, as their life extends beyond that of individuals,
are very certain to reap as they sow.

102 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

XXVIII.
or STRIKES.

308. When laborers for wages make a demand upon their
employer, accompanied with a threat that if he refuses they
will leave him, they are said to “ strike.”

309. Of course, every workman has a right to make his own
terms with his employer; and it can make no diiference—so
far as right,g'oes—whether he acts singly or whether he joins
a number,'»great or small, of his fellow-laborers in arranging
or rearranging these terms. All laws having for their object
the prevention of such combinations and strikes are therefore
unjust and oppressive. Every man has an inalienable right to
seek to better his condition, and the means he uses for that
end lie within his discretion, saving only, of course, that he
must keep the peace. As a workman has no defense against
an oppressive -employer except the threat to leave him, it is the
extreme of injustice to deprive him of that.

310. His strike may bring loss and inconvenience not only

‘ upon his employer, but upon the general community ,: that

does not lessen his right to strike, or to combine with others
in a strike. It may be unwise, and bring suffering upon him
and his associates and their families: that, too, does not im-
pair his right. In short, when a laborer lstrilces, he exercises
only the liberty of deciding to whom and on what terms he will
give his labor; and to interfere with that right would be to
take away his freedom and make him a slave.

311. But the rights he has and uses he must allow to oth-
ers; and the striker has no right to coerce any other working-
man to join him: when he does that, he becomes a criminal
of a very grave kind, for his wrong aﬁects the rights of all
working—men. If it were granted that a striker might right-
fully force another workman to join him, he would thereby

or STRIKES. 103

give up his own rights and liberties; for clearly, if he may
abridge the freedom of another, somebody else, by the same
right, may lessen his. If you have a right to force me not to
work, another may by the same right force you to work.
The striker therefore commits the grossest and most absurd
tyranny when he interferes to force some other man to cease
work. We see such attempts made in this country occasion-
ally, but usually only by the most ignorant of our laborers;
every interference of the kind ought to be severely and sternly
punished, as a dangerous attack upon society.

312. In our times strikes usually take place upon a great
scal_e. The organization of trades-unions has brought hired
laborers into close connection, and enabled them to act in
large masses for Various purposes. Hence we have seen, in
this country, strikes in which thousands of men were united;
and in England, where the trades-unions are more powerful
and compact organizations than here, it has happened that a
general strike of the laborers in one industry was supported
by those engaged in others, out of a general fund of their so-
cieties. In all this the workmen were exercising only the in-
alienable right of determining for whom and on what terms
they would labor; and so long as they did not attemptto
force unwilling laborers to join them, and did not otherwise

break the peace, interference with them would have been the .

grossest injustice.

313. W/Vhether strikes have or have not on the whole bene-
ﬁted the workmen is a question on which political economists
differ, and which it is not easy to decide upon facts. My own
belief is that strikes, as they are conducted, have done no last-
ing good to the strikers or to the mass of laborers, but, on
the contrary, have injured them. Take, for instance, an in-
dustry which yields direct employment to ten thousand men;
a11d suppose them to unite in a strike: while they stand out,
they are not only consuming their saVings—or those of other
workmen who support them-—and are thus the poorer; but

also they are idle, and are tempted to form bad habits. Idle- r

ness itself is a very bad habit. If they succeed, the increased

104 -POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

rate of Wages which they have compelled will not probably
for a long time to come restore to them their former savings
and comforts. Meantime, however, it is probable that other
persons have been drawn into their industry, and thus by their
own act the number of persons seeking their bread by this in-
dustry has been increased, and in the nature of things the de-
mand for Wages is greater, proportioned to the capital available
for Wages, than before; and either Wages will presently fall
again, or some part of the laborers will be thrown out of em-
ployment.

314. Trades—unions have apparently sought to prevent this
natural consequence by arbitrary and tyrannical regulations
concerning the employment of apprentices and of non—union-
ists; and by attempts to shorten the hours of labor, which is
of course only an indirect Way of increasing the rate of Wages.
Also they have endeavored to “make Work” by forbidding

a men to do more than a certain amount of Work in a given

time. All these are deplorably rude and temporary expedi-
ents, the contrivance of men ignorant of natural laws, and,
what is even more mischievous, ﬂying in the face of the golden
rule. To forbid a boy to learn a trade which he desires, to
prohibit the employment of non-unionists, are acts of pure
selﬁshness; and the Whole spirit of the trades-unions in this
matter is one which seeks to monopolize beneﬁts at the ex-
pense of other men. But, as I told you before, nothing is
truer, or more plainly proved by the whole experience of so-
ciety, than that no merely selﬁsh policy can achieve a great or
lasting success. God did not make the World so.

315. Wlhen Wages are permanently too low in any Well-
established industry, that means that too many persons are
seeking to. share in the gross returns of that industry. The
remedy lies in either increasing the demand for the goods,
which means widening the market for them, which can be
done only by an extension of commerce, when more capital
could be proﬁtably invested in the industry; or in decreasing
the number of persons desiring employment in it. Now a
strike certainly does not Widen the market for goods; it does

or TRADES-UNIONS. 105

not extend commerce, which is the only way to permanently
increase demand; and, by alarming capital, is far more likely
to decrease than to increase the proportion used in the given
industry; and by stopping work it checks the accumulation
of that which is already invested. But it does not decrease
the amount of labor offering—for the strikers simply stand
idle, and mean to re-enter the same industry as soon as the

‘contest between them and their employers is decided; as

soon, that is to say, as one side or the other has suffered all
the loss it can bear. I can not see, therefore, how the con-
ditions are changed by the strike—except for the worse; and
a strike of this kind can, I imagine, permanently increase the
prosperity of the workmen just about as much as a man can

lift himself from the ground by a vigorous tug at his coat-—

collar.

XXIX.
OF TRA1)ES- UNIONS.

316. The theory taught by the trades—union leaders is that
in striking the laborers demand only a share of the proﬁts of
the capitalists who are their employers. Thus they persuade
the working-people that “capital,” as they say, is the enemy
of “- labor,” and that “labor” can prosper only by depriving
“capital” of some share of its proﬁts: that one man can
gain only by another’s loss.

317. You will ask, perhaps, whether it is not true that the
owners of capital do seek to increase their proﬁts, even at the
expense of their hired laborers; and whether, therefore, there.
is not a natural antagonism, not between capital and labor,
but between the employer and his hired work-people ?

318. Undoubtedly both employer and .employed seek their
own beneﬁt; and where the employer has the Working—men
in his power he will seek to increase his proﬁts by lessening
their remuneration. This, however, can happen only Where
the laborers are slaves, and where the master, therefore has a

E2

106 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

monopoly of their services. Where the workmen are free
and moderately intelligent, and competition in business is unob-
structed, if capital makes abnormal gains, other capital at once
rushes in to partake of these ; if wages are above the average,
other laborers rush in to share the higher rates ; and in either
case proﬁts or wages, as the case may be, fall to a general
average.

319. Now a trades—uniOn seeks to prevent this natural fall

of wages by restricting the taking of apprentices and the em-

ployment of non—unionists; that is to say, by, so far as its
members can, making a close corporation or monopoly. of the
trade. But suppose the capitalists should in their turn try
to prevent the extension of the industry by combining to pre-
vent fresh capital ﬂowing into it? The one course would be
as reasonable, as logical, and as vain as the other.

320. When wages in any industry fall to a point too low
to, afford the laborers engaged in it a comfortable subsistence,
and with prudence and economy a small surplus, that is a
proof that labor presses too severely upon the capital which
can be proﬁtably employed in that industry. Suppose now
ten thousandpersons employed in such an industry, and all
enrolled in the trades-union. Their present course would be
to strike. Their true course would be to use the fund which
every trades—union accumulates, to send surplus members to a
region where labor is better rewarded : that is to say, to re—es-
tablish the disturbed equilibrium.

321. THERE ARE No SURPLUS MEN IN THE WORLD: when
any one appears to be so, he is only in the wrong place. En-
able him to go elsewhere, and teach him that he shall if need
be do something else, and he is no longer surplus, but highly
necessary to civilization. More than one half of our planet
still lies waste and useless, and suffers for lack of strong arms

-and stout hearts to redeem it.

322. And here I come to one of the most mischievous blun-
ders of the trades-unions. They teach, if not directly, yet by
the spirit of their doctrines, that men have a vested right
in their employments: that a mason has a right to re-

on TRADES-UNIONS. I 107

main a‘ mason, and that society owes him a living by that
trade. I wish particularly to warn you against this error.

No man has the least right to subsistence as merely a mason,_

or a shoemaker, a lawyer, a clergyman, a tailor, a bricklayer,
or a miner. If his labor as a mason is surplus, if no more
masons arewanted whenhe comes along with his trowel, it is
his duty, not to conspire against society with absurd regula-
tions about apprentices and hours of labor, but to go at some-
thing else. A man who regards himself as only a shoemaker,
a mason, a tailor, ‘a lawyer, a physician, or a clerk, becomes
thereby a contemptible object. He loses his independence,
and makes himself the sport of circumstances. In our days,
when new inventions continually change the methods of

' labor, it is especially hazardous for men to bind themselves

for life to a single employment; and those only can hope to
beneﬁt both themselves and their fellow-laborers who, when
they ﬁnd their occupation overcrowded, have courage and in-
dependence enough to seek a new calling, and if possible a
new ﬁeld of labor.

323. Trades—unions and labor societies arise out of a per.
fectly just feeling, among hired laborers, that they are less
comfortable than they wish to be. Education has, in all

‘civilized countries, given to the great class of laborers for

wages the taste and desire for a greater amount of comfort
than contented them in other days. But the means they
take to obtain their desires are, as I have tried to show you,
mostly crude and in violation of natural laws.

324. Trades-unions should use their means to seek out new
ﬁelds of labor; to teach their members energetically that

though to-day theymay be shoemakers, they can, if need be,

achieve success as shepherds, gold—miners, farmers; that de-
pendence is hateful; that independence is possible to all who
have health and will; and that migration is the duty of the
strongest. ‘

XXX.
THE MAL THUSIAN THEORY.

325. VVhen you come to read more elaborate Works of
Political Economy than this, you will perceive that some of
the ablest writers on this subject speak of the desirableness
of placing a check upon the increase of population. Mr. Mill,
indeed, and those who follow him, hold that such a check is
absolutely necessary; and that population should bear a

-“ gradually diminishing ratio to capital and employment ;”

and he urges it as a duty upon the laboring class to post-
pone marriage, and bring fewer children into the world.

326. The Rev. Mr. Malthus, an English clergyman, present-
ed to the World, in the year 17 98, a lamentable and alarming
picture of What‘ must happen if men continued to increase
upon the earth, while land could not increase. He believed
that the bestand most fertile soils were ﬁrst occupied; that
as population increased, the best soils lost some of their fer-
tility, and the poorest came into use; and thus, naturally and
inevitably—supposing'him to be right—the more mouths,
the less food; andvve should by and by be involved in a
general and disgusting scramble for dinner, in which, of
course, the Weakest would starve. Upon this theory Mill
and other writers, whom you will by and by read, base their
appeal for a decrease of population.

327. But it will strike you, if you reﬂect upon the matter,
that, ﬁrst, as it is not possible by law to prevent men from
marrying and breeding children; and as, according to Mill
and others, abstinence from the solace of the family life is
‘to be expected only of the most thoughtful and prudent——in
which they are right, of course—the result would be degen-
eration of a people, Who, acting under such a belief, would
in fact breed, mainly from the lowest part of the race. Thus

THE MALTHUSIAN THEORY‘. 109

a nation which embraced these views would presently ﬁnd an
increase of the ignorant and improvident, and a decrease of
the wise and good: in seeking to make population stationary,
it would breed out the brains.

_ 32 8. But, secondly, it is not true that the most fertile lands
are the ﬁrst taken up. On the contrary, in the ﬁrst settle-
ment of a country the poorest lands are taken up, and are used
in the least productive way———for grazing Iﬁainly. Later, as
population presses, agriculture is begun, but in a wasteful
manner, and still not on the best lands; and it is not until
both capital and labor are abundant that men begin to re-
deem the soils naturally most fertile, namely, the swamps and
overﬂowed lands.. This, which I think Mr. Henry C. Carey,
of Philadelphia, was the ﬁrst to demonstrate, you may see in
all parts of our own country. Nor is this all: as population
presses upon the supply of food, the arts of agriculture are
improved; manures are saved; old lands are redeemed; and
all parts of the soil are made to bear larger crops. '

329. The trades—unions and other labor societies -appear to
have accepted the dolorous View upon this subject which

-some Political Economists have presented to them, and are

acting upon it. If it is true that a general scramble for food

‘is imminent, they are perhaps right in seeking to protect

themselves, by forming their trades into close corporations;
by keeping out new members ; by seeking to do as little
work, and get as high pay as arbitrary regulations promise
them.

330,. But the most fertile part of our planet still lies unim-
proved, and in the possession of savages. When Mr. Malthus
wrote, the whole great continent of Australia lay unoccupied:
now it supports already some millions of English—speaking
people, and adds yearly and enormously to the food and cloth-
ing supply of the world. VVhen Mr. Mill began to write, Cali-
fornia was occupied only by cattle, and a few Mexican fami-
lies who slew these for their hides alone: now that great
state exports wheat and wool and wine in immense quantities.
Texas, as large and as fertile as France, is almost empty. South

110 POLITICS non YOUNG AMERICANS.

' America alone would support in comfort a population greater

than that of Europe and the United States together. Oce-
ania, New Guinea, and many parts of Africa, now possessed
by savages, are ready to receive and support an energetic
and thrifty population. .

331. The world lies open in these days, when steamships
and ﬁre—arms make migration safe—and migration is one of
the great remedies for the grievances of labor. Hence the
importance of the trades—unions: if only they would turn
from their strife against natural laws, and make themselves
the instruments of a vast and well-organized scheme for found-
ing colonies or even new nations.

or PR OHIBITORY LA Ws, so OALLED.

332. Benevolent and philanthropic men, unless they are
also wise, which isnot always the case, are fondof trying to
make men virtuous by act of Legislature. Long_ experience
has shown, however, that purely social evils or excesses, or
even prejudices, where these last are based on differences of
race or color, can not be cured by laws.

333. The intemperate use of spirituous liquors is one of
the greatest curses to which modern society is exposed; it
is the causeof at least three quarters of the vice,‘ crime, pov-
erty, pauperism, and misery to be found in our country. If
you were to cut from the newspapers all the reports of mur-
ders and attempts to murder during a year, you would ﬁnd
that at least three out of four arose out of the misuse of
spirituous liquors. If you trace to its source anycase of
crime, poverty, or extreme misery you may meet, the chances
are at least four to one that you will ﬁnd “Rum did it.” If
we could prevent the misuse of spirituous liquors, we should
save at least one half of the taxes collected by states, cities,
and counties, and very appreciably raise the average of comv

fort and- prosperity among the people. The gravity of the

evil is so generally recognized that the word “ Intemperance ”
has come to have a narrow application in the public mind,
being used generally to signify the misuse of alcoholic drinks:
though men may be and constantly are intemperate in many
other things, as in eating, in the strife "after wealth or social
or political distinction, or in their use of cards and-other
means of amusement; and I have known boys who were in-
temperate in eating candy and gingerbread, in the use of ﬁre-
crackers on the Fourth of July, or in novel—reading.

334. When a boy manifests a morbid and depraved desire
for candy, judicious parents deny him this indulgence—but
they do not necessarily deprive all his brothers and sisters
who have no such morbid craving. .80 when a man has con-
tracted a passion for gambling, he does well to avoid the use
of cards entirely; but it does not follow, because some men
intemperately waste their means in poker-playing, that all
elderly ladies and gentlemen should be forbidden a harmless
and pleasant game of whist.

335. In many of our states, however, philanthropic persons
demand what is called a Prohibitory Liquor Law—a law en-
tirely forbidding the sale and use of spirituous liquors; and

they demand this because they believe it is the only way to

extirpate the vice of intemperance.

336. Law-makers, in order that their labors may be efective
and useful, are bound to bear inmind the passions and natural
tastes of mankind. Not every wrong or evil can be cured by
law; and there are matters which the wise law-maker leaves
unnoticed on the statute-books. .

337. Further, it is important for you to know that any law
is ‘unwise which has not the general favor of the community to
which it is to be applied; for if a law has not this general
countenance and support inpublic opinion, it can not be en.-

t forced in a free state. It is only a despotic ruler who can,-by

force of arms, terrify and compel his subjects into a change
of their habits. Hence, such a law as that lately before Con-
gress, and wrongly called a “Civil Rights bill,” is most un-

who do not like them. A lawfcompelling all hotel-keepers to
receive colored men as guests favors the colored men at the

to which they can resort Without offense to their feelings,
These feelings may be foolish or wrong ; but they exist——and
they are so strong and bitter that they can not be removed
by laws. Time, in such a case, is better than laws. The
Civil Rights bill, in fact, comes under the head of Prohib-
itory Laws, which We arerconsidering.

338. In legislating upon the use of spirituous liquors, a
Wise laW—mal:er would remember that the craving for stimu-
lants is universal among mankind; that spirituous liquors
and wines are of important use in diseases, and when moder-
ately used are doubtless of service in preventing some dis-
eases; that the right of a man to decide Whether or not he
needs a stimulant can not be declared by any general law, be-
cause each case must necessarily be judged upon its own
features, and it must therefore practically be left to himself;
that it is not a function of law to prevent a man injuring
lLz'mseZf—else the government would have to interfere in
every act of our lives: but only to prevent him from injuring
others ; and that, ﬁnally, a law prohibiting the sale and use
of an article in universal demand can not be carried into ef-
fect without vexatious and justly hateful searches in private
houses and interference with individual desires and tastes.
To_ a Wise law-maker, therefore, greatly as he might be im-
pressed With the evils arising to society out of the misuse
of spirituous liquors, a general law totally prohibiting their
use and sale within a state, or the United States, would seem
inexpedient, because it could not be enforced, and, if it could
be, would involve an unjust and vexatious interference with
individual rights.

or PROHIBITORY LAWS, so CALLED. 113

.339. Prohibitory liquor laws are thus unwise, and their
adoption ought to be opposed because they are directed not
against the abuse, but against the use of an article. But
society has a right to seek, by judicious regulations, to pro-
tect itself against the results of the misuse of liquors. It has
a right to exact of the retail liquor—seller a tax or penalty for
the privilege of pursuing his injurious calling, and to establish
and enforce severe penalties for selling without such permit
or license. It may rightly levy a ﬁne upon the liquor-seller
in whose house a drunken man is found; and put a penalty
upon habitual drunkenness——which might very justly be hard
labor. for the beneﬁt of his family. Also the community
may refuse entirely to license bar-rooms or other places for
the sale of liquor at retail and its consumption on the prem-
ises. Moreover, it would be eminently just to devote the
proceeds of liquor-licenses to the support of the hospitals,
poor-houses, orphan asylums, jails, and penitentiaries which
the misuse .of strong drink does so much to ﬁll; and the
necessities of these charitable and penal institutions might be
made, in any state or county, the measure of the license fees
which should be exacted from liquor—sel1ers, instead of ﬁxing
a mere arbitrary sum. In this way, at least those who keep
and frequent tippling—houses would be obliged to make up to
the community some part of the money-loss inﬁicted upon it
by their vice. '

340. In the vain attempt to prohibit the use of intoxicating
liquors, the temperance people have neglected many practical
measures for lessening the misuse—which is all they have any
business with. It is but recently, for instance, that they have
awakened to the great advantage of empowering small com-
munities, townships, or even school—districts, and wards in
cities, to decide, by a vote of the inhabitants, the question
whether retail liquor-licenses shall be granted or denied with-
in their bounds. This is called “local option,” and I will
proceed to explain to you its uses.

1 14 POLITICS . FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

XXXH.
op “ LOOAL OPTION.”

341. “Local option” "is an application of the principle of

Decentralization, which I explained to you in Section VIII.
, 342. In our political system, as you have read, some things
are assigned to the Federal Government, some to the state
government, and some by this to_the county, city, and town-
ship governments. *Of late, it has been seen by wise men
that some matters which have been usually left to the state,
or’ to the counties and cities, might advantageously be as?
signed to the smaller political subdivisions.

34.3. For instance, a compulsory school law is found to be
very diﬂicult of. enforcement over a whole state. In some
parts public opinion would readily sustain such a law; in
others it is opposed, and where this is the case such a law
is likely to be a dead letter. ‘Again, a law refusing liquor-
licenses would be sustained byvpublic sentiment in some
localities, but would be openly violated in others, where . the
public opinion was decidedly hostile to it.

344. If, now, instead of adopting one rule for all the people
of a state, the Legislature should empower every township,
city-ward, or school-district to declare by a vote of its citizens,
to be taken once a year, that within the limits of such a sub-
division licenses should be granted, or refused, it is evident
that, as each of these small subdivisions would decide for
itself, its inhabitants would be “directly thrown upon their
responsibility. If the majority wished tipplinggshops, they
would vote for licensing them; if they wished to extirpate
them, they would vote to refuse licenses; but it would be cer-
tain that public sentiment would enforce the law. Moreover,
by such an expedient the friends of temperance‘ would be
able to raise the question once a year, to bring it prominently

or conronxrrons.   115.

before the people in each locality, and to show the people, by
statistics and facts, the economical advantages of temperance.
This course has been pursued for a number of yearsin the
township of Vineland, in New Jersey, and the people annu-
ally vote to refuse all licenses to sell liquor. They have
found, as the result of their ﬁrmness, that crime and pauper-
ism are almost entirely banished from their town.

345. The expedient of local-option can be usefully extended
to other measures of policy; ‘and, if this is done, it will, by
and by, bring us back to the town-meeting system of New
England, which I described to you in Section-XV., and thus
one of the most important political reforms possible in our
system Would be brought about; for thus the people of a
small locality, in public meeting assembled, Would once more
discuss their local affairs, and vote directly upon the policy
they Wish to pursue and the money they are Willing to spend
for public purposes.

346. A Corporation is an association of persons united to
promote a common purpose, either of morals, pleasure, or
business. Thus a church, a library association, a college, a
Masonic or other benevolent society, an insurance or railroad
or telegraph company, is a corporation.

347. Corporations are called in law “artiﬁcial persons,”
which means that they have no natural existence, but are the
creatures of law. It is commonly said of them that they

V “have neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned,”

which means that they are not amenable to the usual penalties
for misconduct. It is, therefore, necessary and proper to

limit strictly their powers and privileges, to impose severe

penalties for their misconduct,and to enable the public to
hold_them quickly and easily to account in the courts. Leg-

116 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

islative bodies, whose ﬁrst duty is to protect the rights of the
people, may justly regard corporations with suspicion, and
scrutinize with great care all grants of power to such bodies.
348. But the right of free association for business and
other purposes is of so great importance that it ought not to
be unduly hampered. All persons in a state ought to have
equal rights to form corporations, under general laws, carefully
drawn ; and it ought never to be necessary to go to a legisla-
tive body for a special charter, or instrument creating a cor-
poration. General laws should equally limit and deﬁne their
powers and privileges, and impose equal penalties for miscon-

‘ duct. Thus a general railroad law should stand on the stat-

ute-book, subject to which any body of men within the state
might form themselves into a railroad company; and the
same is true of telegraphs, steamships, library societies,
churches, etc. Thus monopolies would be prevented, and a
fruitful source of corruption in legislative bodies removed.
For where special charters are granted, it is a common occur-
rence to see rival companies struggling against each other be-
fore legislative committees, and using bribery to gain their
ends or defeat their opponents.

349. While the rights and powers of corporations ought

to be rigorously deﬁned and limited, those which are granted

them are as sacred as any personal rights, and ought to be as
secure against attack.- A corporation, when it does wrong, or
exceeds its powers, is amenable to the courts; to drag it be-
fore a Legislature or Congress, for what is called “Investiga-
tion,” is not only unjust, but tends invariably to the corruption
of the legislative body. For the corporation will defend it-
self; and,,being a creature without a soul, whose members feel
no personal or moral responsibility for the corporate acts, it is
very likely to be unscrupulous in self-defense if it is attacked
in an unjust way.

350. As corporations have unusual powers, and are often in
the nature of monopolies, the governments which create them

may rightly require of them reports of their operations‘ at-

regular andvﬁxed intervals;'and provide penalties for failure

on OONFEDERATION AND UNION. 117

to report regularly or correctly, as well as for violation of the
law under which they exist. In "this way accurate informa-
tion concerning them is made accessible to the public. With
the help of such information, and with unrestricted liberty to
form new corporations, subject to equal and general laws, re-
strictions, and penalties, monopolies may and will be kept in
order. It depends, however, upon the vigilance of the people
to do this; for corporations, like governments, are always
ready tojpresume upon the ignorance and _carelessness of the
people.

XXXIV.
OF OONFEDERA TION AND UNION.

351. You already know from history that our country was
first settled mainly by English people, who were formed into
different colonies, subject to the British crown. The English
eventually acquired all the settled parts of our Atlantic‘ sea-
board. ‘

352. The management of colonies by all the European gov-
ernments was, at that time, conceived in the most narrow and
selﬁsh spirit. A colony was held, by the ablest statesmen of
the last century, to be rightly treated as a dependency whose
inhabitants were to enrich only the government Whose ﬂag
they served, and the nation from which they were derived;
and the people of a colony were therefore forbidden to trade
with foreign nations, and even to manufacture for themselves
many articles which were produced in the mother country.

353. The British Navigation Act closed the North American
ports to all but English ships, forbade any but English sub-
jects to engage in foreign trade, and prohibited the exporta-
tion of sugar, tobacco, cotton, wool, and other products of the
colonies, to any country but" England. Also the English
colonists were forbidden to establish manufactures of several
kinds, because it was held that they would thus injure the in-
dustries of England.

118 POLITICS FOR ‘YOUNG’ AMERICANS.

854. It was this interference with the right to produce‘

what they pleased, and to freely exchange their products
where they could do so most advantageously, which began
that alienation from England which ended in the Revolution-
ary War and the independence of the colonies.‘ The greater
part of the wrongs set forth in the Declaration of Independ-
ence grew out of the efforts of the English government to
conﬁne the commerce of the colonies to the mother country;

’ out of the determination of the Americans freely to produce

what they pleased, and freely to exchange their products
wherever it was to their advantage to do so. I call your at-
tention to this fact, in order that you may see the extreme
importance which civilized men attach to these rights.

355. At the close of the Revolutionary War the colonies,
which had become states, formed themselves into a Confedera-
tion; but, jealous of their separate independence, and fearful
of a new master, the states, in the Articles of Confederation,
reserved, each to itself, almost all the powers of government.

356. The government of the Confederation had no presi-
dent or other executive; it had no power over individuals,
either to tax, to coerce, or to punish them. It consisted of a
Congress of delegates elected by the state Legislatures, and

~ upon this Congress were‘ devolved certain duties, which, how-

ever, it had no power to perform. All its determinations
were to be carried into effect by the states, whom, however,

C it had no power to coerce.

357. The states, under the Confederation, reserved to them-
selves the power of the purse. The Congress could declare

r the amount of revenue needed to carry on the general govern-

ment, but the taxes were laid and collected by the states, ac-
cording to a general apportionment, and when, as sometimes
happened, some states did not pay in their quota, the Con-
gress had no power to enforce its payment. The Congress
had authority to declare war, but it could not raise a single

‘soldier: that was reserved to the states. The Congress was

made an arbitrator between the states: but it was powerless
to enforce its decisions. Finally, the states, which alone

or CONFEDERATION -AND ‘UNION. 119

could levy taxes, reserved to themselves the regulation of
commerce, and the right to tax the exchange of products, not
only those coming from abroad, but also those which were
sent from one state into another; and it was not long before
high and vexatious duties were exacted, for the “ encourage-
ment of home industry,” on-the importation of goods from
one state into another, which led, naturally, to retaliatory
laws, and presently to such obstruction of the exchange of
products as caused a general prostration of all industries in
all the states. Production was discouraged, because markets
were limited; at every state boundary custom-house officers
stood to exact tribute of the man who had something to ex-
change; and as the proﬁtableness of industry depends on the
right to exchange, and is diminished by every check placed
upon the freedom of exchange, and by every limitation of the
area over which a product may be exchanged, production was
fatally hampered, and the whole country fell into poverty.
358. The first movement toward our present form of gov-
ernment arose out of a convention called to remove some un-
endurably vexatious fetters upon the exchange of products.

Commissioners were appointed by the Legislatures of Mary?

land and Virginia to make freer to the people of those states
the navigation of the Rivers Potomac and Roanoke, and the
Chesapeake Bay. They were unable to act effectively; and
at their instance the Legislature of Virginia, in 1786, pro-
posed a convention of commissioners from all the states, “ to
take into consideration the state of trade, and the propriety
of a uniform system of commercial relations.” These com-
missioners advised a convention to revise the Articles of Con-

federation, and it Was this body which in 1.787 framed our

present Constitution. _ _ V

359. Once more you see the extreme importance to the
prosperity of industry of freedom of exchange. Our Con-
stitution grew out of the necessity-* of freeing the exchange of
products from the fetters imposed upon it by the states ; and,
accordingly, those who framed it took care to secure in the
most effectual manner this great object.

120 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

360. The Constitution differs in but two fundamental par-
ticulars from the Articles of Confederation : it gives the Cen-
tral Government direct power over individuals; and it estab-
lishes absolute freedom of exchange between all the states,
and leaves the regulation of foreign commerce, which was
and .is still regarded as a source of revenue, exclusively in
the hands of the Federal Government. All other changes
were mere incidents arising naturally out of these two. For
with power to levy taxes and to punish individuals came the
necessity for an executive and a judicial branch of the govern-
ment. -As to other matters: the government of the Con-
federation, like that which took its place, was charged with
the declaration of war and peace, the maintenance of post-
roads, the regulation of the coinage, the maintenance of em-
bassadors abroad, etc., etc., just as our Federal Government
is—only it had no power to cause any thing to be actually
done, because it had no power to coerce individuals, to en-
force its acts by courts or soldiers, or to raise a revenue.

361. The adoption of the Constitution, by freeing the ex-
change of products among the states, at once revived indus-
try, by vastly enlarging the market for all products. When
men could once more sell without obstruction what they had
raised and produced, every energy was stimulated which be-
fore was crushed, and we began thus, by the removal of ob-
structions to exchange, that career of prosperity and growth
which has been the wonder of the world.

362. The union of the states under a Central or Federal
Government has thus been the direct cause of all our long
and remarkable career of prosperity, and this because, ﬁrst,
it has secured to our people, within certain limits, unrestricted
freedom of exchange, which has acted as a constant stimulant
to their enterprise, ingenuity, and industry. It has set a
prize on intelligence by securing its products an immense
market, covering the greater and the richest part of the con-
tinent. Second, the Constitution assured homogeneous laws
and free intercommunication over the whole of our territory,
and thus made migration possible" and safe, whereby new

' ﬁelds of activity are constantly opened to the_ thrifty poor

and to the restless and adventurous of our population.

363. Finally, the self—government in local affairs reserved to.
the states has enabled these to experiment safely, and to make

changes in the state constitutions, not always for the best, but
often neededimprovements, and thus, by comparing results,
to gradually and safely improve our system of government.

XXXV.
THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM.

364. Appended to this volume you will ﬁnd the Federal
Constitution, which I advise you to read with care.

365. You will discover that this instrument creates a gov-
ernment of limitedpowers, but of unlimited authority within
its province. For instance, the President of the United States
can not appoint any state ofﬁcer, nor issue a command to him
——not even a justice of the peace or a constable in a township;
but he may draft or compel half a million of citizens into the
army in case of war. Congress may declare war, and levy

taxes to carry it on; it may declare who are citizens, how

much gold shall go to a dollar, and how many pounds of
wheat to a bushel; but it can not enact or repeal a city
charter, nor interfere in the acts of even a township’s trus-

6 tees.

366. This limitation and division of powers we call Decen-
tralization. You have read of it in Section VIII; and its
practical application is one of the most, important and bene-
ﬁcial features of our political system.

367. Under it, you must remember, the Federal Govern-
ment has absolute command and power over every citizen and
his property, for ce7°tai1z]9m"poses and in ce7*tai7z 9~eZctt2'0ns ,' and
this is necessary to give it eﬂiciency. But it is absolutely
wit/tout power over the citizens in otizer releotions, and this is
necessary to secure our liberties, a11d togive elasticity to our

122 ~BOLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

political system; which means to make change possible with-
out revolution.

368. The people of the United States are a nation; the
Federal Government is a national government in the truest
and largest sense of the word; and the Constitution empowers
it to do all that any nation can require of its government, and
to act in the most direct and decisive manner upon the in-
dividual citizen.

369. The Federal Government has the exclusive charge of
our intercourse, as a nation, with other nations; and it alone
can make treaties. If you travel abroad, your citizenship is
declared by a Federal passport; your rights are defended by
the Federal Government; you are known as a citizen, not of
New Jersey or California, but of the United States; the flag
of your country is the Federal flag; and foreign governments
have not even any oﬁicial knowledge of the existence of our
states.‘ .

370. The Federal Government has the exclusive authority
to make treaties, to declare war and peace, to raise armies and
maintain a navy; and though the militia in time of peace are
trained bythe states, it must be according to rules adopted by
the Federal Congress. It has the entire charge of the common

‘ defense against attack from other nations, and has the power

to defend its own existence against rebellion, and make its own
laws obeyed by all the citizens—all state constitutions and
laws to the contrary notwithstanding—as was shown in the
late war. It is "empowered to raise revenue by internal as well
as external taxes, and, if necessary, to borrow money for these
and many other purposes. ‘Its tax-collectors and other officers
proceed directly against the individual citizen, and in its own
courts. It has the exclusive authority to establish and main-
tain post—ofﬁces, to coin money and punish counterfeiters; to
ﬁx weights and I_neasures, to regulate commerce, to take cog-
nizance of offenses committed at sea, in the territories, and
against the laws of nations; to enact bankrupt—laws, to declare
who shall be citizens, and to grant patents and copyrights.
In all these matters the state governments have absolutely no

THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM. 123

authority; and all laws enacted by Congress, for these and

other purposes recited in the Constitution, are the supreme
law of the land, and as such entitled to your faithful obedi-
ence, even though a state constitution or laws should command
you to the contrary. For, an act of Congress, a decision of
the United States Supreme Court, or a command of the Pres-
ident when this is in accordance with an act of Congress, is
above any or all state laws and constitutions. The states are
so completely prohibited from interfering with the Federal
Government in its own ﬁeld, as this is prescribed in the Con-
stitution, that they can not even tax Federal bonds; and the
Federal power is so supreme, within its limits, that it may
punish even so small an offense as the obstruction of one of
its mail wagons.

371. It may be well to explain to you here, also, that when
a citizen disobeys a Federal law he is directly dealt with—-——ar-
rested, tried, and punished—-—by Federal officers and courts;
but when a state adopts an unconstitutional law, the citizen
called on to obey it appeals to the Federal Supreme Court,
and its decision on the question is ﬁnal. Thus the President
does not act directly against states as he may against citizens;
and this is an important distinction.

37 2. In all that concerns us as at natioa, either in our ex-
ternal or internal interests, the Federal Government is thus
supreme. But in a great many important relations it has
nothing to do with us; and these are left as absolutely to the
state governments, and to the county and city governments, as
the other and general interests are given to the Federal Gov-
ernment. In fact, great and apparently overshadowing as is
the power of our Central Government, it" is scarcely felt by the
individual citizen, except when we have a war, which involves
the raising of armies and a navy, and heavy taxation, or when
we are cursed with a heavy debt, or serious internal disorders.
Before the late war there were millions of Americans who
hardly knew that there was a Federal Government, except
when they voted for a President or a Member of Congress.
The Federal revenues were then collected entirely at a few

124 POLITICS non YOUNG AMERICANS.

custom—houses; the only taX—gatherer seen by the mass of
citizens owas a state oﬁicer; and the only evidences of the
Federal power’s activity which then came under the notice of
the multitude of citizens were in the beneﬁts they received
from post-oﬁices, light—l1ouses, and the survey of wild lands.

373. A state government has the exclusive authority to
maintain peace and order within its limits, to punish crimes,
except those committed against the United States or against
the laws of nations; to appoint the_police and maintain the
prisons; to regulate the tenure of lands and the rules of in-
heritance. It has charge of education and the public health;
it creates and regulates all corporations, such as railroad and
insurance companies, within its limits; it declares who of its
citizens shall vote; it may regulate the sale of liquors and
poisons, and abolish nuisances. In all these matters, and
others of the same kind, the state has jurisdiction and power,
to the exclusion of the Federal Government; and the Grov-
ernor, the state Courts, and the state Legislature have abun-
dant power to perform all their duties. ;

374. For instance, thought the Federal Government has the
right and power to punish resistance to or violation of its own
laws any where within the national limits, it has no right to
interfere in case of a riot or insurrection against the state
authorities, until these, in a formal and prescribed manner, call
on it for aid. If you remember what you read in Section
VIII. about the meaning and advantages of decentralization
and local self—government, you will easily comprehend the rea-
sons for such a division of power, and perceive that it is not
arbitrary, or fancifully made. ‘

375. Within the state there are a number of political sub-
divisions: the county, township, and school—district, and the
city and ward; all these are created and may be changed by
the state Legislature, and to each a part of the work of gov-
ernment is assigned by the state constitution and in accord-
ance with custom, which varies somewhat in different states.
A city ward is the equivalent of a township; but cities are
with us governed by a charter granted by the state Legislat-

THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM. 125 T

ure, while county governments are usually prescribed in a
state constitution. There is no reason for this difference;
and the practice of granting special charters to cities has been
the cause of much ignorant and mischievous legislation, and
of wide—spread corruption. A city government needs to be

somewhat diﬁerently constituted from that of a county; but

there is no reason why all the cities of a state should not exist
under a single charter, carefully drawn. 

376. The table which you will ﬁnd on_ the next page will
give you a summary View of the different political subdivisions

A recognized in our system, with their duties and oﬂicers. You

will see how we proceed, step by step, from the smallest polit-
ical division, where the people act directly upon measures
which most immediately concern their daily lives, to the
largest, tonwhich general powers only are intrusted, having
reference solely to the welfare and security of the whole na-
tion; Take notice that by this division of powers and duties,
ﬁrst, government is made less cumbrous, and is therefore likely
to be more eﬂicient and economical; second, that as the power
of a subdivision becomes more formidable, it is less intimately
brought in contact with the people—-thus the state govern-
ment does not concern itself with. roads, and the Federal Gov-

ernment has no charge of schools or the police; third, that

thus the people are accustomed as much as possible to act
directly upon their local and private interests, leaving only
matters of more extended interest to the charge of the more
distant and necessarily representative governments, as the
state and the Federal authorities. Thus political education
and the spirit of independence are maintained.

OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF AN AMERICAN

37 7. In all the constitutions, Federal and state, the people
have reserved to themselves certain rights and immunities,
which none of their governments are, allowed to interfere
with ; and it is important that you should understand these.

378. As an American citizen, you are a free man; and no
one has a right to enslave your person, except for crime, of
which you must ﬁrst be convicted, upon a fair trial in open
court; or to take from you your property, except by due
process of law. A

379. You have a right to believe what you please; to wor-
ship God as you please; to express your opinions on all sub-

‘ jects freely (but you maybe punished for libelous attacks on

your 'fellow—men); to print what you please (with the same
restriction); to assemble with whom you please, for lawful

and proper objects; to petition the state or Federal Govern-

ment for redress of grievances.

380. You have a right to be arrested only for cause men- ' I

tioned in a proper and legal warrant, served by an authorized
officer of the law, who must show you his authority.

381. You have a right to be released on bail, unless
charged with a capital crime; and to be produced before
the nearest court, on a writ of habeas corpus, in order that
that court shall decide whether your arrest and conﬁnement
were properly made, and for sufficiently probable cause.

382. You have_a right to a speedy trial by jury, to be con-

person for your defense, and to know at once and deﬁnitely,
before your arrest, vsghat you are charged with. y

tuted authorities fail to protect you, you have a right to
damages for their neglect.

384. You have a right to be secure in your house against
searches by officers of the law, except on proper warrant,
which must ﬁrst be shown you, and for sufﬁcient cause.

385. You have a right to keep and bear arms, but not,
in most of our states, to carry them concealed upon your per-
son. I

386. You have. a, right to sue for damages any oﬁicer of
the law who arrests or tries you in an unlawful manner.

387. These are the sacred and inalienable rights of all
American citizens, and no constitution or law can deprive him
of them. They make him secure against unjust or usurping
rulers, and against unscrupulous attacks from a fellow—citizen.
They enable the citizen to be safe against injustice, or to ob-

OF THE DUTIES OF AN AMERICAN UITIZEIV.
388. If you have political rights of which, even by your

* own will, you can not-divest yourself, and which are therefore‘

properly called inalienable, so you l1aVe political duties which
also you can not justly neglect or lay aside.

389. It is your duty as an American citizen to obey the
laws, even if they are, in your belief, unjust or unwise. Gen-
eral Grant once shrewdly said that the best way to procure
the repeal of an unjust or unwise law was to rigorously en-
force it. It is your right to expose the folly or injustice of
a law, to demand its repeal, and to try to get a majority to
repeal it. But while it remains a law, you are to obey it.

390. It is your duty, if you are of age and a man, to vote

or THE DUTIES or AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. 129

at all elections, and to inform yourself beforehand what meas-
ures and men you ought as a good citizen to support.

391. It is your duty to insist upon the prompt execution
of the laws; to be ready, even at much personal incon-
venience, to aid in their enforcement, if you are called upon
by proper officers; and to resent with indignation every sign
of lawlessness and violence, and require its vigorous suppres-
sion. For instance, if a riot should break out in a city where
you are living, you are not to go out of town until it sub-
sides; but you are to hasten to offer your support to the
authorities, and to require their prompt and decisive action
to I-estore order. k y

392. It is your duty——if you are a.voter——to serve, when
called on, as a grand or petit juror; and this at even great
inconvenience. i I 9

-393. It is your duty, if you are a man, to serve in the
militia, if the law commands it; and every American voter
ought to have a sufficient knowledge of the manual and use
of arms to enable him to act eﬁiciently if called out as part
of the posse comitostus to put down a riot.‘ A

394. It is your duty to act generally with some political

A party, and to exert your inﬂuence upon its leaders to induce

the nomination of capable and honest men for oﬂice. And
it is your duty, if your party nominates a bad man, to vote
against him, and thus keep the public and general good be-
fore your eyes, and set an example of true public spirit be-
fore your fellows. .

395. It is your duty to watch the conduct of public oﬂicers,
to see that they perform their duties and observe their con-
stitutional limitations; and if they do not, then it is your
duty. to help to expose them, and at the elections to punish
them. For it is only by such -vigilance that a nation can
preserve its liberties unimpaired.

396. These are your political duties, which you can not
neglect or abjure without disgrace to yourself and harm to
the country. 3

XXXVIII.
OF TRIAL BY JURY.

397. When a crime or an offense has been committed, and
the police oﬂicers have arrested the person suspected of it, the
prosecuting officer collects the evidence against him, and upon
the meeting of the_grand jury lays it before them in the form
of an indictment. They investigate the charge ; call wit-
nesses before them if they wish, and if they have reason to
believe guilt probable, they return the indictment with the
indorsement, “A true bill.” If they believe that the charges
are not sustained, they make return “ Not a true bill,” where-
upon -the person is released ; but he may be rearrested if, sub-

‘ sequently, new evidence is found against him."

398. The grand jury is a body of responsible citizens, usu-
ally twenty-three in number, selected under the eye of the

court. We have, of course, grand juries for the Federal as -
- well as for the state courts. Their authority to investigate

crimes and offenses is ‘not limited to cases laid before them
by the prosecuting oﬁicer; they may make independent
investigations, and if they ﬁnd guilt or blame, may make
what is called a presentment, which may thereupon be fol-
lowed by an indictment, and this by trial. Upon the meet-
ing of the grand jury, it is usual for the court to instruct
them in their duties, and it may also direct their especial at-
tention to notorious offenses. All their proceedings are se-
cret, and the oath the grand jurors take makes secrecy a
duty. _

399. The object of a grand jury is to prevent injustice. If
the prosecuting attorney were alone empowered to bring of-
fenders to_ trial, he might either misuse this power for pur-
poses of revenge, and thus annoy and disgrace innocent per-
sons; or he might be bribed to withhold an indictment, and

on TRIAL BY JURY. « 131

thus favor the escape from justice of wealthy or powerful
criminals. The powers of the grand jury are a check upon
him; and their number, and tl1e care usually taken to select
only responsible and well-known citizens, makes the corrup-
tion of a grand jury improbable. The grand jury has power
to compel the attendance of witnesses.

400. When a person charged with a crime or an oﬁense is
brought to trial, it is before a petit jury. The judge is not

allowed to decide upon the guilt or innocence of the prisoner-

—for he might be prejudiced, or unduly influenced; twelve
men, chosen from a numerous list of citizens, are appointed
to hear the evidence, and to declare upon the question of
guilt. In selecting a jury, the accused, and the plaintiff or;
the prosecuting attorney, have a right to “challenge” or ob-
ject to a. certain number peremptorily, or without giving
reasons, and they may object to others if they can show that
these are prejudiced. The judge attends to the pleadings of

l the lawyers; takes care that witnesses are properly sworn
and examined; and, in his summing up to the jury, points

out to them if the counsel on either side have made unsup-
ported assertions, instructs the jury in their duty, and en-
deavors to clear the case of all extraneous matter; his charge
is of course without bias or favor. Thereupon the jury re-
tire to deliberate; and if they can unanimously agree, their
foreman announces the verdict. The judge then delivers the
sentence, as provided by the law. When an accused person
has been regularly acquitted by the verdict of a jury, he can
not again be brought to trial for the same oifense.

401. Now you can see that it is highly important, for the

cause of justice and public order and morality, that both the _

grand and petit juries shall be composed of intelligent and
upright citizens; otherwise crime will go unpunished, and
society will suffer in a way not easily repairable. Bear in
mind, therefore, that to serve on a jury is one of the most-
important duties of an American citizen—a duty which he

can not avoid without wronging the community of which he

is a part.

XXXIX.  
THE PRIMARY MEETING AND THE 0A UOUS.

402. Party management begins in the townships and wards,
and with the action of the body of members of the party in
these districts. The primary meeting is the place where all
the members of the political party may_ express their will,
and where they choose delegates to the larger bodies called
nominating conventions. If it were convenient, all the mem-
bers of the party in a county might ‘meet in one place, to se-
lect delegates or to nominate candidates; and in New Jersey
and some other states this was formerly done. But the town-
ship or wardprimary meeting is now general, because it is the
least inconvenient. The primary meetings select delegates
for the county, congressional, and state conventions; and
these delegates, meeting in conventions on an appointed day,
nominate the candidates for ofﬁce. Any person who is a
voter in the township or ward, and at the next preceding
election is known to have voted with the party holding the
primary meeting, may properly take part in it.

403. As party government is inevitable and necessary in a
free country, it is the duty of every citizen to attend the
primary meetings of the party with which he acts. If hon-
est and intelligent men neglect the primaries, they thereby
hand the control of their party over to bad men. It is im-
portant to the welfare of the country that both the great
political parties shall be controlled by wise and honest men;
for a corrupt or debased minority can oﬁer but a feeble oppo-
sition to the majority, and iii reality helps to strengthen and
to debase the majority; whereas a powerful, honest, and in-
telligent minority compels the majority to govern carefully and
honestly. The demoralization of the party which is in the mi-
nority may thus, as you see, bring calamities on a country. '

THE -PRIMARY MEETING AND THE GAUCUS. 133

404. “Politics” have always been, in every free state, an
enticing profession, followed by many honest and high-
minded men out of a desire to. see their favorite principles
prevail ; by other men to advance their private fortunes ; and
by yet others from a mixture or combination of both these
motives. Our own politics are less corrupt, and our own
politicians, taken as a class, are far more scrupulous than
those of most free nations have been, either in ancient or
modern times. Wlien, therefore, men talk or write about
the peculiar debasement of our politics, you need not en-
tirely believe them. There is a good deal of irritating ig-
norance and’ some corruption among our political leaders,
but not nearly as much as there is in England or France; it
vexes us more because we meet it" face to face. The truth
is that our party politics are more intelligently, less dishon-
estly, and more honorably conducted than those of Great
Britain, with which we are oftenest compared, and that the

. average of political morality is higher in the United States

than in any other nation in the world. V

405. In an ideal state, the people, gifted with unfailing dis-
cernment of merit, would select continually, and without
prompting of any kind, the wisest and ablest men for their
rulers; and these rulers would devise always the most benef-
icent and the noblest of policies for the nation. Practi-
cally, however, these matters‘ are managed somewhat dif-
ferently. The ‘people are guided more or less by newspapers

and by political leaders ; men, able or the reverse, are brought A

into political life by careful management of their friends, or
of the higher chiefs of a party, who are always on the look-
out for capable men to help them; platforms are studied
over and prepared by small coteries of politicians, to make
them attractive to the people and conformable to the princi-
ples which the party desires to advance; and——to return to
our primary meetings—-the delegates chosen at these are for

the most part selected beforehand by the political managers

of a county or district, to ‘insure the nomination of certain
candidates. Thus where several persons desire a normnation

134 ~ POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

for the same place, the p7'z'ma7'3/ meetings‘ are the scene of the
strife between them ,' and it is there that good citiee/ns may de-
feat a corrupt or incapable candidate in their own party.

406. The preparatory work which I have described to you
above is done in what is called a cancns—which is simply a
private meeting of inﬂuential politicians.’ VVhether tl1e cau-
cus shall be a good or an evil thing depends on the character
of the men who compose it. It is a method of political
action used alike by the best and the vilest politicians; the
wisest and most necessary measures of the last twelve
years, for instance, as well as the basest and most injurious,
have been discussed and prepared in caucus before they were
presented to the public; and both the ablest and the worst
of our political leaders have been introduced into political
life, and advanced in it, in these silent, secret, but not there-
fore necessarily evil councils, by their friends. In a country
where intelligence is so widely diﬁused, and where there is
so high an average of ability, it is very seldom that a man,
except after long and brilliant service, becomes so conspicu-

-ously the one man for the place that his party retains him

as a matter of course. -
407. A fault in our political arrangements makes the cau

s cus very often, in the hands of bad men, an instrument for

elevating corrupt men to power. This is the practice, in the

estates and cities, of electing a great many of the executive

officers. VVhere this is done, the caucus enables corruption-
ists to prepare a ticket composed of a few good men and a
large tail of the lowest class of politicians, and such a “ slate”
is then forced upon the party as “the best thing that can be
got.” The viler kind of politicians do not trouble themselves
much about a Congressional caucus; but wherever a dozen or
twenty candidates are to be nominated, there is their oppor-
tunity. If the executive head, be he President, Governor,
or Mayor, has the selection, appointment, and removal of all
his subordinates, a “slate” becomes impossible, andthe cau-
cus is no longer so powerful a tool in the hands of bad men.
In some of our states, at one tim_e, members of Congress were

THE PRIMARY MEETING AND THE CAUCUS. 135

chosen on a general ticket; that is to say, the whole Con-
gressional delegation of the state was voted for by all the peo-
ple of the state. But experience showed that the caucus put
a few good men and a multitude of bad ones on the same
ticket; and as both parties did this,_the result was for evil
only. It is sometimes urged that if the President, Governor,
or Mayor has unrestrained power to appoint or remove his
subordinates, he will appoint bad men. But even the de-

cisive check of the Senate does not always suﬁice to prevent

the appointment of conspicuously bad orjincompetent men;
and it does serve to conceal the faults of a ruler, and lessen
his responsibility to the people, in a mischievous manner. It

is better that a President or Governor or Mayor shall show

his character plainly by bad appointments; for then he will
become hateful to the people, and lose his chance of re-elec-
tion, while the caucus will be shorn of its power for evil.

408. Do not be ashamed or afraid to meet in caucus, if you
should by and by take part in politics; but remember that
bad men and measures may be defeated there as well as at
the primary meetings. And as a sound rule for party action,
remember that if, in spite of your eﬁorts, your party nomi-

‘nates a bad man for office, you should openlyvote against

him. For it is better, for your party’s interest, that it should
be defeated if it nominates bad men than that it should suc-
ceed. When a political party becomes the tool of corrupt or
ignorant men, it is in danger, not of a temporary, but of a
lasting defeat. If both parties nominate bad men for an
office, it is better that your own party should be defeated;
for it is not in that case responsible for the misgovernment,
and your party leaders may learn wisdom from defeat.
He’nce, the more ardently you desire the success of your
political party, the more vigorously you may scratch the bad
names off your ticket when you go to the polls.

XL.

OF THE IMPORTANCE AND DUTY OF THE
MINORITY. '

409. The ﬁrst duty of a minority is to become a majority.

410. A minority is just as likely to be right as a majority;
and if it is, and if it persists in asserting its principles, and
if its leaders are able enough to frame a practical and consti-
tutional policy, and to meet their opponents in argument be-
fore the people, it will by and by ﬁnd itself in the majority.
For “the people, rightly instructed, always favor the right.”
The long course of the antislavery discussion showed this.
The ﬁrst antislavery men were not practical politicians, but
moralists ; they demanded immediate and unconditional eman-
cipation, because slavery was unjust, and injustice ought at
any price to be removed. These excellent men had but little
direct inﬂuence on practical politics——for the answer to their
appeal was that the Constitution forbade interference with
slavery where it existed. What they did was to advertise to
the people, with wonderful courage and pertinacity, the mon-
strous wickedness of slavery. The political leaders of the mi--
nority, however, seized their opportunity, and at the auspicious
time framed a policy upon the slavery question which was
both practical and constitutional. They said, “We will not
touch slavery in the states where it eXists——that would be un-
constitutional; but we demand that it shall not be extended
to the territories, which are controlled by the Federal Govern-
ment.” With that policy they appealed to the people; and
as it was both right and practical, and constitutional, and as
the minority possessed very able leaders, who freely met
their opponents in public debate, in time they achieved a
perfectly legitimate political victory.

411. A minority is contemptible, and must fail, when it

OF THE IMPORTANCE AND DHUTY OF THE MINORITY. 

has neither principles nor policy to oppose to the majority,
but relies upon abuse of its opponents, or mere criticism of
the majority’s blunders. For in such a case, unless the ma-
jority is extraordinarily corrupt or inefficient, the people, see-

ing no principles‘ at issue, will condone its offenses, and 1nain-

tain it in power, out of a conservative spirit which is one of
the most valuable qualities in a free people. Nor are they
wrong in this ; for if the minority have no satisfactory policy
or principles to oﬂer, their struggle is merely one for place
or oﬁice, with which the people have but little sympathy.

412. In general, inefﬁciency is more quickly resented by
the people in their rulers than corruption, unless that assumes
the "dimensions of mere vulgar.robbery. Inefliciency and
corruption usually go together. But the strongest appeal
of a minority to the American people is against injustice;
and a party in power may lose an election, and ﬁnd itself
suddenly deserted byits strongest friends among the people,
on such an issue as that called the Poland Gag Law, which
was believed to attack the liberty of the press.

413. A strong and able minority is a very important part
of a legislative body. Its office there is to examine and criti-
cise the propositions and acts of the party in power ; . to scru-
tinize its expenditures; to expose its inefficiency, its usurpa-
tions of power; to ridicule its blunders; and to oppose all
attempts at bad legislation. Where a minority is strong in
votes, and has able leaders, the ﬁrst effect of its vigilance is
to make the party in power more careful in administration
and legislation, and thus to" beneﬁt the country; and its
second eﬁect is to rally to its side the most independent
and ablest members of the majority, and thus—if the ma-
jority is inefﬁcient or corrupt——to prepare the people’s minds
for a change at the elections.

414. But, on the other hand, where a legislative minority
lacks ability and statesmanship, and oﬂers a merely factious
or trivial opposition, it is very apt to fall into contempt with
the people, and to injure its own prospects of political suc«
cess.

138 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

XLI.
OF OITY G 0 VERNMENTS.

415. A city is a political corporation, created by the states
and governed according to a charter framed by the state Leg-
islature, and which may be altered or repealed by that body
at will. This charter prescribes the duties and deﬁnes the
powers of the rulers, just as any other political constitution
does. ' . T

416. In our political system cities have become the strong-
holds of misrule. This arises from two causes: ﬁrst, the city
government concerns itself more intimately with the lives of
the inhabitants than any other, wherefore there is a propor-
tionately greater possibility of corruption and maladministra—
tion ; second, city charters, almost without exception, subdivide
power and responsibility among boards or commissions, and
thus disable the people from discovering the authors of cor-
ruption and misrule, and from punishing them even if they
are known.

417. The inhabitants of a city depend upon their central
political authorities to make, repair, and clean the streets, to
regulate the police, to abate nuisances, to protect them against

‘ﬁres, to adopt and enforce health regulations, to grant licenses

to sell liquor, to provide public markets, to regulate street cars
and gas—pipes, to care for the water supply, to manage the parks
and other public places, to take charge of paupers, to con-
trol hospitals, to manage the free schools, to control wharves
and piers if it is a sea-port, and to do a number of other
things, of which some, outside of cities, are done by each citi-
zen for himself, or by the private enterprise of citizens united
for that purpose, and others are divided among county, town-
ship, and school-district authorities, each independently and
directly responsible to the people. Moreover, all public work

on em: GOVERNMENTS. ' 139

in a city is on a large scale, and involves very great expendi~
tures, compared with those of a rural county. Finally, the
population of a city is less homogeneous in character than
that of a rural county; the proportion of poverty is much
greater; the number of people who live from hand to mouth
is larger; the average of comfort is lower; the dependent
part of the population is more numerous. At, the same time,
little or nothing is left for the people to determine in the
smaller divisions—the wards and school—districts; and they
are thus made politically ignorant.

418. Under such circumstances, it is of great importance
that the central power, to which so much is assigned, shall be
clearly visible to the people, in order that they may always
and easily hold it responsible. The entire executive power
and responsibility ought to be given to a single man-—the
Mayor——-because then every citizen who had cause of com-
plaint would know whom to blame. The Mayor ought to have
the appointment of all his subordinates, because thus only can
he hold them to their duty. The executive powers——that is
to say, the enforcement of the laws+—ought not in any detail
to be assumed by the Council; for this is a most fertile

a source of corruption. The Council, which is the city’s legis-

lature, ought to be a numerous body, so that each councilman
or alderman should be personally known to his small constitu-
ency, who could then oblige him to care for their interests,
and punish him for neglect or corruption. Finally, the courts
in a city ought to possess a very high character, and neither
judges nor justices of the peace ought to be elected, but should

_be appointed——probably by the Governor of the state——and

for life or good behavior, and they should have large salaries.
With such a system, the city government would be amenable

_ at all times to the will of the inhabitants, who could punish

extravagance, inefﬁciency, or any kind of maladministration,
at the elections, if they chose; and could at any rate make as
good a government as they wished. Moreover, I want you to
remember that where great power is given to an executive,
able men like the place, and will seek it; for able men like to

140 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

exercise power. But if you make of a governor or mayor
only a ﬁgure—head, and give the real power to others, the of-
ﬁce falls into contempt.

419. Now almost all our city governments in this country
are framed on principles directly contrary to those ‘I have
stated above. The executive powers, which ought to be con-
centrated in a Mayor, are divided among diﬁerent boards and
commissions, and are thus frittered away. -The Council is
usually a small body; the judges and justices of peace are
elected, together with a large number of executive officers;

_the different parts of the executive hold ofﬁce for different

periods, and the people can never, at a single election, remove
all the ofﬁcers who have been concerned in maladministration;
and ﬁnding themselves thus disabled, and compelled, more-
over, to vote for a great number of officers of whose character
and ﬁtness they can not inform themselves, they presently lose
all interest in public affairs, and resign the political power to
knaves and their tools. The Mayor of a city like New York,
did he have the powers which belong to the office, would
have authority and patronage almost equal to that of the
President of the United States; and the ofﬁce would be one
for which the ablest citizens would strive. But if he has no
power, or but little, really able men will refuse the place.

420. City governments are made needlessly cumbrous and
corrupt, also, by performing some duties which might well be
left to private eﬁort. For instance, the ﬁre—insurance com-
panies could manage a ﬁre department much more cheaply
and effectively than a political government. Again, the ques-
tion of licensing drinking—shops might well be left to the peo-
ple in the wards. Street-cleaning could, perhaps, be left to
the wards also, though, as it has to do with the general health,

, this might not be possible unless the city government assumed

not only the inspection of streets, but the punishment by ﬁne
of those ward authorities who neglected this duty. Finally,
the city ought not to own market spaces, docks, piers, or other
property used by private individuals. The city government
should exercise, of course, the right of police and inspection,

OF SOME FAULTS IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTIONS. 

but it _can not own and manage such property either proﬁt-
ably or efficiently.

421. If you remember What you read about Decentraliza-
tion and about the Responsibility of the Executive, you will see
the Way in Which city governments may be reformed: ﬁrst by
relieving them of Work which they can not do Well; and next
by ﬁxing power and responsibility upon the Mayor. What is
Wanted is to enable the people readily, and at a single effort,
to change the whole administration; then they can really
punish maladministration—-and they undoubtedly Will, When-
ever it begins to oppress or offend them. For the mass of
the people are vitally interested in moderately good govern-
ment, and will inevitably get it, if the machinery of govern-
ment is so arranged that they can, by Willing it at the polls,
punish the inefficient or corrupt rulers.

422. It is a grave fault of most of our state constitutions
that they allow, and in some cases make necessary, special
legislation. By this is meant acts specially granting privileges
to particular persons. You Will see, if you consider for a mo-
ment, that _‘where such grants are made, the Legislature be-

' comes subject to the attack of cunning and unscrupulous men,

who will seek privileges injurious to the people; that rival
corporations will oppose each other before the Legislature,
and resort to bribery to gain their ends or defeat their oppo~
nents; and that for perfectly proper objects men Will be put
to a needless expense and trouble to obtain a special charter.
42 3. Whatever any citizens or association can rightfully do,
they may do under general laws, equally applicable to all other
citizens. Thus every state should have a clearly drawn gener-
al railroad law, and other general laws under Which all kinds
of corporate enterprises could be prosecuted without the ne-

142 - romsrcs roa rourre AMERICANS.

cessity for special charters; and the Legislature should be for~
bidden in the Constitution to grant or to entertain any appli~
cation for a special charter of any kind whatever. i

424. It is another grave fault of most of our state constitu-
tions that they interfere with the power of the Governor to
appoint his subordinates in the executive department, and
thus weaken responsibility, and cause confusion in the govern-
ment. Every where, also, the sheriff is elected in the coun-

‘ties; whereas he ought to be appointed by the Governor. He

is the Governor’s lieutenant in the county; the peace officer,
who in case of riot or public disturbance has a right to call out
the body of citizens, and with whom in all such emergencies
the Governor communicates. His office, which is of right a

. very high and responsible one, is now degraded, and, having

large fees annexed to it, has long been one of the important
political “spoils.”

425. It is another grave fault in almost all our state con-
stitutions that they oblige the people to elect the judges, and
thus debauch the courts, and lower their tone and authority.

426. It is another grave fault of the state constitutions that
they restrict the power of the people, in the counties and
townships, to refuse to license drinking—shops, to adopt com-
pulsory education regulations, and to do other things for
which they ought to be competent. Thus the Constitution
errs in making too rigid the general rules under which the
people are to live.

oz?’ TERRITORIES, PUBLIC LANDS, 0'01) 0NINs, AND
  MANIFEST DESTINY.

42 7 . One of our greatest and most important politica. safe-
guards lies undoubtedly in the possession of vast quantities of
public lands, and in the wise and liberal policy under which
these lands have been thrown open to settlement.

OF TERRITORIES, MANIFEST DESTINY, ETC. 143

42 8. The Federal Government is the original owner of waste
or unsettled lands——both those in the territories and those
which lie within constituted states. It has made a free gift to
every state of a large quantity of these public lands, to be
used for the support of public schools and of agricultural col-
leges; it usually gives to a state all the swamp and overﬂow-
ed lands within its bounds which were public or Congress
lands at the time of its admission into the Union; and it
gives to every actual settler one hundred and sixty acres
from the surveyed lands, free of cost, except the triﬂing
charges for proofs of actual settlement and continued cultiva-
tion. It has also, within a few years, given a great quantity
of land to railroad companies, on condition that they should
construct and work railroads through these lands, and thus
open them to settlement.

429. The political advantage of our possession of so vast a
quantity of wild lands lies in this, that it leaves open for many
years a broad ﬁeld for the exertions of the more adventurous,
enterprising, and restless part of our community. A hired la-
borer to whom the condition of dependence has become hate-
ful has no refuge in a thickly settled European state except
emigration to a distant country, and abandonment of his own
nationality. This ought not to deter a European from emi-
grating; but the American workman is happy that he need
not leave his country, but may, under the protection of its
flag and laws, settle himself on the public lands, and there,
with very little capital, achieve independence at least, and per-
haps more. He has not to fear unequal or strange laws; for
the farthest Western territory is ruled by Congress upon well-
deﬁned principles, and becomes a state as soon as it has ac-
quired a suﬂicient population. The ﬂag which ﬂoats over
him commands peace and order, and the whole power of the

430. A territory is organized politically by permission of
Congress; its Governor and other executive oflicers and judges
are appointed by the President; it has a Legislature which

enacts laws of local application, but Congress has the right to

_ reject any of these acts. The inhabitants elect a delegate who

represents them in Congress, but who has no vote. His duty
is to tell the House in which he sits the wants of his constitu-
ents. When the people of a territory desire to form the1n-
selves into a state, they are allowed by Congress to frame and
adopt a Constitution. This they present to Congress, for its
scrutiny and approval; and Congress may in its discretion re-
ject the instrument, and thus refuse to create the state; and
from this decision there is no appeal, except to another Con-
gress. » Some territories, as Colorado, have applied several
times for admission as states. The people of a territory do
not vote for President. -

431. Hitherto we have been fortunate in our territorial ac-
quisitions, for we have gained land encumbered with but few
inhabitants, and well ﬁtted by climate, soil, and other natural
properties, for the prosperous settlement of our own farmers
and mechanics. Thus not only our laws, but, what is of inﬁ-
nitely greater importance, our manners and customs, have been
easily transferred to and made dominant in these new lands;
and it is one of our greatest pieces of national good—fortune
that, with unimportant local differences, we are still, in spite
of the vast extension of our boundaries, a homogeneous people
———that is to say, a nation whose parts or elements are similar,
not only in language, but in habits, customs, manners, metl1—
ods of thought, and modes of action. ,

432. If you will think clearly, you will see that what we
want, for the future, is not more people, but more land. If we
should receive no further additions of population from Eu-
rope, we are. now so numerous and so prosperous that our
numerical increase will be very rapid. But we shall constant-
ly receive great numbers of European immigrants, and these,
who readily adapt themselves to our customs, are a welcome
addition, and quickly become a part of us. For their descend-
ants and ours, it would be a great advantage if we could secure
still more vacant or sparsely "settled territory, provided that
these new lands were, by their climate and productions, ﬁtted

or TERRITORIES, MANIFEST DESTINY, ETC. 145

for settlement by our own people. When, therefore, people
use the phrase “Manifest Destiny,” they mean—if they re-
ﬂect at a-ll——not that we ought to, or could without hurt to
ourselves, annex indiscriminately all the states adjoining us,
but that it is a part of our natural and sound policy to pos-
sess ourselves, for the use of our own people, of all the waste
and desert lands lying near our boundaries. ,

433.‘ Plainly, the annexation of tropical islands like Cuba,
San Domingo, or the Hawaiian group, does not fall within
this policy; for, 1st, these countries have already a tolerably

dense population. 2d. This population is alien to ours in race,’

and in all its habits and customs, as well as in language. 3d.
These islands are not suitable to make homes for our farmers
and mechanics ; on the contrary, their products are grown on
estates wl1ere a few planters employ, at very low wages, great
numbers of rude laborers, and need but a very few intelligent
mechanics——nor could their industries be proﬁtably pur-
sued in a diﬁerent way. Finally, the people whom we should
have to accept with the land, in annexing these islands or the
thickly settled parts of Mexico, are not fitted by character or
training for the duties of American citizenship; and, as they
occupy the land, there would be but a slender possibility of

T assimilating them to ourselves. But, on the other hand, we

could not with security to ourselves refuse them political
rights, if we made them a part of our body politic. It is re-
pugnant to our political theory to hold territories except with
the expectation of their speedily becoming states; because
otherwise local self—government would be impaired, and the
Federal administration would unduly increase its’ patronage
and means of corruption. ' ~
434. Thus, as we want land and not people, sound policy
tells us not to annex territory which has already an.independ—
ent and tolerable dense population. But sound policy also
urges us to cultivate intimate and friendly relations with our
neighbors; and this we can do with advantage to ourselves as
well as to them by establishing with them the utmost free-=
€lO1Il of commercial exchange. Commerce makes sure and

faithful allies; and if we were wise enough to establish and
maintain absolute free trade with Canada and Mexico, with
the Sandwich Islands, with San Domingo and Hayti, and
with Cuba-——if, as is probable, that island becomes independ-
ent of Spain—we should greatly extend our own commerce,
and should have the use of all these countries without the re-
sponsibility of ruling them. We should ﬁnd them willing
and faithful allies in case of war; and our own course to-
ward them would preserve them from the aggressions of En-
ropean powers. In this way, I would like you to believe, we
should best fulﬁll, if not our Manifest Destiny, what is of
greater importance, our Manifest Duty, toward these weaker
neighbors of ours.

435. The larger the machine, the more important is it
that it shall be built upon sound principles of mechanics, and
that it shall be carefully managed in accordance with the laws
of its construction; for a break in a machine which weighs
a hundred tons and moves at a great speed in all its parts
is more disastrous than one in a hand—machine whose mo-
mentum is insigniﬁcant, even if its speed of revolution should
be great.- ' I

436. "What is true of apiece of machinery in this respect is
equally true of a state or nation. The more populous it is,
and the more extended its area, the more unwieldy it be-
comes, the more disturbing is every friction of the parts,
and the more vital it is that its managers or rulers shall be
made to adhere closely to the principles on which its govern-
ment is constructed.

487 . The fundamental and most vital principle underlying
our political system is that called DECENTRALIZATION, by which
the duties ‘imposed by the people upon their rulers are divided

WHEN WE NUMBER; ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS. 147

among several distinct governments, each acting independent-
ly in its sphere, but all subordinate to one general or organic
law, called with us the Federal Constitution, and so arranged
as to work harmoniously to a common’ purpose.

438. You have seen, in other sections, how this division of

powers is regulated in our political system; and I have ex-

plained to you that it has clearly deﬁned objects: namely, to
leave as much as possible to the private enterprise and inge-
nuity of the people; to leave to them also, in the smaller polit-
ical subdivisions, the direct management of their minor or lo-
cal affairs, and thus to train them in independence, self-gov-
ernment, and public spirit; secondly, to enable the people eas-
ily to control and change their rulers at regular elections,‘ and
to do this in one locality without necessarily disturbing the
whole country; thirdly, to give the people, in their different
subordinate governments, strongholds against possible usurpa-
tion of power by the Federal rulers, and in the Federal Govern-
ment security for peace, order, and free exchange and inter-
communication in all the parts ; fourthly, to relieve the Central
or Federal Government of a multitude of details, the control of
which would make it cumbrous, ineﬁicient, and tyrannical, and
would dangerously increase the patronage of the Federal rul-
ers and their power to corrupt the people; and, ﬁnally, to en-
able the people of different ‘states, counties, and even town-
ships to determine, each locality for itself, upon local regu-
lations and laws suited to their habits and customs——-all of
which laws, however, are to be in conformity with the Federal
Constitution and the laws of Congress. ‘

439. Thus we secure uniformity in the general system, with
independence, variety, and elasticity in details ; the least inter-
ference with personal liberty, combined with security to per-
son and property.

440. We Americans enjoy the most perfect government in
the world; and we owe to it almost all the blessings which
make our lives exceptionally happy. Peace, liberty to a degree
unknown to the subjects of European powers, free opportunity
for the exercise of all our faculties, knowledge and intelligence

148 POLITICS FOR. YOUNG AMERICANS.

within the reach of the humblest citizen, security against in-

‘ justice, stability of order—these and other blessings we owe,

not to the rulers we choose, but to the form» of government
under which we live, which is as beneﬁcent in what it leaves
undone as in what it does.

441. But in all earthly contrivances there is a tendency to

change; and it has been noticed that as we increase in popu-‘

lation there is an increasing propensity to impose more upon
the Federal Government, and to take from the powers of the
local governments. This all wise citizens ought to resist, for
as we increase in population it is necessary that we shall even
add to the number of objects over which the people shall de-
termine and rule in their local governments; for thus only
can their political training be continued. If the Federal army
should always be held ready to put down local disorders; if
the state Legislatures should continue to undertake the gov-

V ernment of cities; if the Legislatures or Congress should un-

dertake the adoption of prohibitory laws; if Congress should
assume the charge of public education and the control of cor-
porations: by the time we number a hundred millions the
American people will have far less‘ public spirit and far less
capacity for self—government than now.

442. It is in this direction that wise “citizens will strive to
guard against future dangers. The inconveniences, the tempo-
rary maladministration, and above all the apparent carelessness
with which the people condone blunders in their public serv-
ants, need not give you occasion for gloomy forebodings. Our
people are naturally inattentive to minor details in their gov-
ernments. They forgive much to their rulers, if only they
are convinced that these have an honest desire to serve the
public. ‘They are slow to lose their faithiin old public serv-

' ants, and especially in a political party which has once secured

their conﬁdence by conspicuous good service.

44-3. This quality, which is often vexatious, and sometimes
causes thoughtful men to despair, is in fact a most valuable
trait in any people ; for it secures what is of the very greatest
importance in public aﬁ:'ai1's+—sTABILITY.

WHEN WE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS. 149

444. Change is so great a curse that We could not even
abolish so great a Wrong as slavery Without great temporary
suffering: and that people is happiest and most likely to main-
tain its liberties, and to be prosperous, Which, by natural tem-
perament, dislikes change, and can be moved to it only upon
important occasions and for clearly and even pressingly neces-

-sary objects. Stability of laws, stability in industry and busi-

ness, stability of character and ofpurpose in the individual, are
all of far greater importance than the most brilliant experi-
ments in government, or the most seductive and adventurous
enterprises.

445. But——ﬁnally———bear in mind that NOTHING Is STABLE
EXCEPT JUSTICE. Unjust and unequal laws are liable to
perpetual change. '

R ULES FOR THE C’0N.D U0 T OF DELIBERA TI VE
ASSEMBLIES.

446. When you come to act with others in a public meet-
ing of any kind, Whether it is a college debating club, a town,
church, or business meeting, or a legislative body, you will
discover the extreme importance of orderly and systematic
proceedings. A numerous assembly of men. gathered for
consultation or action of any kind very easily falls into dis-
order, and even slight disturbances or irregularities ‘cause a
great Waste of time and temper. Thus a petty obstruction
in the line of march of an army, which to two or three per-
sons would be hardly noticeable, might yet, if the army con-

tained ten thousand men, each of Whom would have to leap

over it, probably delay the rear several hours.

447. Moreover, wherever men are gathered in deliberative
assemblies, there Will be some of hasty tempers, some more
eager, less logical, or more peremptory than others; and to
preserve the rights of all it is absolutely necessary that each

150 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

member shall be able to appeal to some generally recognized
rules of procedure, and that all shall submit to these rules.

448. To avoid disorder and maintain the rights of each,
English—speaking people have in the course of time perfected
rules for the conduct of public business, which apply as Well
to a debating club as to the Houses of Congress. These gen-
eral rules are founded on common-sense, and have for their
main objects the easy preservation of order and fair play to
all, and the protection of the minority in such bodies.

449. When the French legislative body falls into an uproar
and confusion too great for its presiding officer to control,
he puts onshis hat, and by.that act concludes the session.
His only way to restore order is to stop the proceedings en-
tirely. But in the British House of Commons, or in the
American Congress, long—established and universally respected
rules, to violate which would be a very grave oﬁense, prevent
the necessity of such a ridiculous and time—wasting expedient.

_ 450. The great body of the rules, as well as the precedents
on which they rest, are contained in various books with which
Congress and the State Legislatures are familiar, and to which
constant reference is made in these bodies. But it is not
necessary to the proper conduct of a debating or college so-
ciety, or of a town or church meeting, that its members
should be conversant with the Whole body of Parliamentary
laW._ A knowledge of the elementary rules Which should
govern proceedings in all deliberative assemblies _is very use-
ful to every American ; and these, accordingly, I will endeavor
to arrange in a clear and intelligible manner for your use in
the following pages. Acquaintance with these elementary
rules may enable you on occasion to save the time of a public
meeting, help to maintain order and dispatch business init,
and preserve your own temper.

451. I desire, ﬁrst of all, to impress upon you the absolute
necessity of conducting all such bodies with dignity and order.
Not unfrequently young people meeting in a debating club
or other such society fancy the object of their convocation
too unimportant to make digniﬁed conduct necessary. This

DELIBERATIVE ASSEMBLIES. 1 51

is a mistake. N 0 business whatever can be Well conducted,
nor can any society or assembly prosper, unless there is de-
corum, self—restraint, and such respect shown to the object of
the meeting and to the persons assembled as will lend dignity
and even a little solemnity to the proceedings. I have seen,
once in my life, a state legislative body in which the Speaker
was careless on these points, and Weakly allowed members to
enter with hats on their heads, to smoke during the session,
to interrupt him and other members, and to indulge in trivial
and disrespectful language; and I noticed that this body did
not respect itself: the disorderly conduct permitted to its
members made the body contemptible to itself, and affected
very seriously its usefulness to the people. Hence, no matter
how unimportant the object of a public meeting may be,
if you are one of its members, it is your duty to enter
quietly andwith uncovered head; to sit in your seat at-
tentively listening to the proceedings; to address yourself,
if you speak, to the presiding oﬂicer only; to refrain from
all triﬂing or disorderly conduct; -and thus to assert the
dignity of the body and preserve its decorum while it is in
session.

452. The ﬁrst business of a meeting is to choose a presid-
ing officer. In large and formal assemblies, as political con-
ventions, it is usual to begin with the selection of a temporary
chairman. This is because in such assemblies the office of
chairman or president is often so important that several perx
sons desire it, and it is necessary to establish order, so as to
enable the assembly to choose that one whom a majority
prefers. The temporary chairman calls the meeting to order;

and when quiet is obtained declares nominations in order,

whereupon the-candidates for chairman or president and sec-
retary are nominated and elected. Or it may happen that
the temporary chairman appoints, at the desire of the assem-
bly, a committee to report a list of ofﬁcers. T

453. ‘Where a public body comes together Without previous
organization, there has usually been some preliminary under-
standing among those who called it together as to the per-

152 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

son to be chosen presiding officer; an_d in such a case one of
these rises in the meeting and nominates the person thus
agreed on, and puts the nomination to vote. If the meeting
chooses it may vote him down; and in. such case, naturally,
another person would then be proposed. Usually, however,
there is no such disagreement on the ﬁrst organization.

454. In any case, the meeting is not organized and pre-
pared for business until a presiding officer, and properly also
a secretary, are chosen. I

455. W'here the body has already officers, the chairman or
president takes the chair punctually at the hour previously
appointed, and calls the meeting to order. .

456. In permanent bodies, the next proceeding in order is
to call the roll of members. The object of tl1is is to ascer-

_ tain in a formal manner that a quorum is present.

457. Aquorum is the number of persons required by the
rules of the assembly or society for the proper transaction of
business. Usually this is one more than half the total num-
ber of members; but the number may be ﬁxed by a special
rule. No business can be properly transacted without a
quorum, except the calling of the roll, and the necessary pro-
ceedings for summoning absent members. This is to pre--
vent a minority from taking advantage of the absence of the
majority to adopt measures and transact business which would
not have the consent of the majority. If at any time during

the session a quorum is not present, any member may call‘

the attention of the chairman to that fact, whereupon all busi-
ness stops. Parliamentary bodies, as Congress or a State

Legislature, have by law the power to compel the attendance

of members; and when no quorum is present, if the House
does not wish to adjourn, it sends its sergeant-at—arms to sum-
mon absent members to the bar, where they may be interro-
gated by the presiding oﬁicer as to the reason for their ab-
sence, and, if the House wishes, ﬁned. Such a proceeding
is styled a “ Call of the House ;” and when it is determined
on, the doors are usually locked, and remain locked until the
House declares itswish to have them reopened. This is to

DELIBERATIVE ASSEMBLIES. 1 53

i keep those present from leaving the iHouse, and to maintain

a quorum for business. -

458. The assembly being organized and the officers in their -

places, it is the duty of the chairman or president to state the
business before it. If the body has met in pursuance of’ any
law or previous resolution, it may be proper to read that. If
several matters of business are to /come up, he announces ﬁrst
that which is ﬁrst in order ; and thus the body goes regularly
to its Work.

459. It is the duty of the presiding ofﬁcer to maintain or-
der. To this end he, and not the House, is addressed by the
speakers; to him all motions, resolutions, and bills are sub-

mitted; no member ‘may speak unless he is ﬁrst recognized _

by the president; if several rise at once to address him, it is
his part to recognize one, whereupon the others sit down; and
Where, as constantly happens, members do not understand
the order of business before the meeting, or its condition at
any moment, he must be ready to explain, to decide upon the

propriety of motions, and generally to conduct the meeting. .

It is of great importance that the presiding officer should be
treated with respect; that his decisions should be promptly
and clearly made; and that they should be readily acquiesced
in. If a member doubts the correctness of a chairman’s de-
cision, he may say so, and appeal to the House to support
him; and the House may, at its discretion, overrule such a
decision. But this ought seldom to be done, and will rare-
ly happen if the chairman is competent. \/Vrangling and
fussiness are productive of disorder in a public meeting;

and it is generally the most ignorant members who are H

ready to jump, to their feet with a» question of order or an
appeal against the chairman.

460. In legislative bodies, Where a part of the business is
referred to committees to be considered and elaborated, such
committees are either selected by the presiding oﬂicer—as in
the Federal House of Representatives—or elected by the
House itself——as in the United States Senate. In the latter
case, practically, the majority meet in caucus, and there frame

H ' G 2

 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

the committees, which are afterwards formally reported and
submitted to the vote‘ of the whole body. The Speakership
in the Lower House is much sought after, because of the
power the Speaker has over the policy of the country in the
selection of committees. VVhere the Speaker is an able man,
he can thus at the beginning of a session give a direction to
the public policy by placing at the heads of important com—
mittees men of decided views. Also, he has thus the power
to favor his personal friends. The reference of business to
committees is that they may consider the proposed measure,
and report upon it to the House, which ‘may then concur
with the committee or reject its report. This saves time;
but it is also apt to prevent" discussion; and the Federal
House of Representatives has in the course of time become
the slave of its committees, who, except in the case of rev-
enue measures, are very apt to prepare a verdict which the
House is compelled to accept without debate, by the adroit
use of a motion called “the previous question,” of which
you will hear further on. y

461. The order of business is regulated by the meeting,
which may set a certain day and hour for the consideration
of a speciﬁed motion; may declare ‘a regular order for the
introduction of business; and may otherwise regulate this
matter. In the Federal House of Representatives, for in-
stance, for the general convenience, one day in the week is set
apart for the consideration of private bills; an hour on an-
other day is set apart for a call of the states, for the intro-
duction and reference of bills and joint resolutions; and if
any member on _a certain day can get the consent of the
House by a two-thirds vote, he may have even these rules
suspended for the introduction of special business; In any
case, and whatever business is to come up, the Speaker an—
nounces it to the House. _ _

462. VVhen the member of an assembly wishes to make a
motion or introduce a matter of business, he rises, and calls
out, “ Mr. Speaker ”——or whatever the title of the presiding

officer may be ; if he is recognized, he has then the ﬂoor, and-

DELIBERATIVE ASSEMBLIES. 1 55

states his proposition. He may be required to reduce this to
writing; and if it is an important matter he has probably
taken the precaution to do this beforehand, so that it may
be recorded without error. Any motion, to be entertained,
mustbe seconded, which is an immediate proof to the as-
sembly that more than one of its members favors it. A
motion made and seconded, and announced by the presiding
officer, is thereupon the property of the meeting, and can not
be withdrawn without its consent; this, however, is almost
always given.

463. A fundamental rule is that a motion voted down can
not be repeated until some other business has intervened.

464. Thus the motion to adjourn, which is said to be always
in order——-because an assembly ought always to have it in its
power to dissolve its session——can not, if it is voted down, be
made again until some other motion has been made or business
transacted. This is to prevent an irritating waste of time.

465. It is another fundamental rule that no one can inter-
rupt a speaker with a motion, even one to adjourn. The per-
son who has the ﬂoor is entitled to complete his remarks, or
to occupy the whole time allowed him by the meeting, and
interruptions are out of order. If he gives permission to
another to interrupt him he thereby resigns his own_ right
to the floor; though he may give way for a brief interrup-
tion, by general consent, and resume afterward. .

466. Next in the order of precedence, after the motion to
adjourn, is the motion to lay on the table; which is substan-
tially to adjourn the business in hand, in order that something
else’ may be taken up.

467. Neither of these motions is debatable; because the
assembly ought to have a right without delay, and at any
time, to dissolve, or to turn to another subject.

468. A successful motion to lay on the table is generally
equivalent to a rejection of the measure. This can not come
up again out of its regular turn, except by a motion to take
it up, or to reconsider the motion to lay‘ on the table; and
the pressure of business before a meeting usually makes“-* its

- 156 POLITICS FOR YOUNGHAMERIOANS.

members reluctant to go back to measures once disposed of
or put out of the way. A motion to take a bill or other
matter from the table is debatable. .

469. Third in the order of precedence,‘ among Parliamen-

_ tary motions, is “the previous question.” This is of the

same nature as the two preceding: its object is to get done
with business; and, like the other two, it is not debatable, be-

cause the assembly ought to be able at any time to make’

known that it is ready to vote upon the question before it.
Wlien a member calls for “the previous question,” and the
call is seconded, the presiding officer is bound to put it. It

takes this shape: “Shall the main question be now put ?”

If the majority vote “aye,” that shows that they have made
up their minds, and wish no further debate.

470. If the assembly, by supporting the previous question,
demands the main question, then the presiding oﬂicer takes
in their proper turn, beginning with the last oﬁered, the sev-
eral amendments to the question before the House, if there
are any, and ﬁnally brings to vote the question itself.

471. The previous question is sometimes an instrument in

the hands of a majority to prevent debate, and to push through
measures which perhaps would not bear discussion; but where
it is ruthlessly used, it is very apt to arouse a feeling of op-
position which is dangerous to a majority.

472. Where it is pretty certain that a public assembly or
meeting is ready and desirous to vote, a cry of “Question!
question 1” calls the attention of the presiding officer to that
fact; and if he perceives that the meeting really wishes to
vote, he usually, before recognizing the next speaker, asks,
“Is the meeting ready to vote on the proposition?” and the
answering cries tell him what is the wish of the members.
In such a case there is no need for the “previous question”
formally put.

473. The three motions above described are not debatable,
because, if they were, the assembly would be helplessly in
the hands of a few of its members, who could by intermin-
able debates keep it in session, or prevent it from acting on

DELIBERATIVE ASSEMBLIES. 1 57

bills or measures before it. The United States Senate does
not allow the previous question, and the minority there some-
times deliberately and purposely put off decisions on measures
by a long series of speeches, which have the purpose, by a
continuous session, to wear out the majority, and bring them
to terms or force‘ them to a compromise.

474. You must understand that a motion to adjourn is not
subject even to an amendment to adjourn to a named day or
hour; because, as an amendment,this would open debate.
Where it is desired to substitute for an adjournment with-
out date one to a ﬁxed date, it is usual to make a request

that the ﬁrst motion be withdrawn, whereupon the other is .

made.

475. It is well to remember also that a motion to take a
recess is diﬁerent from one to adjourn. A recess only inter-
rupts, and does not close the session; and when after the re-
cess the assembly comes together, it proceeds to business at
once without’ opening formalities, such as reading the journal
or calling the roll. On the journal the date of the session
remains unaltered, even though the recess should carry it over
to another civil day. But a recess can not carry the ‘meeting
past the regular hour of its next day’s assembling.

476. The business before a meeting is in the shape either
of a bill or a resolution. In either case it is subject to the
following motions—besides those before mentioned-—-and in
the order in which they are named :

477. To postpone to a ﬁxed day or hour; whereupon the
meeting agrees to consider it at that time; and when the
time arrives‘ the presiding ofﬁcer’s duty is to suspend other
business, and lay that before the House.

478. Or to commit——which means to refer it to a commit-
tee for consideration, which committee is expected to report
upon it to the House, at its own convenience, or upon the

‘order of the House. The business of legislative bodies in

this countr is too much referred to committees as I have
7
pointed out to you above; and it 1S common to see a meas-

ure referred to a committee merely to get it permanently

158 APOLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

out of the way. Of the duties of committees I shall speak
further on.

47 9. Or to amend: If the member who introduced the bill
or resolution accepts the amendment, it is at once incorpo-
rated in his bill; if he rejects it, it becomes a separate part
of the question, .and the House votes upon it before it does
on the bill. It is possible to amend an amendment (but not
to amend that again); but it ought to be avoided, and the
friends of a measure can agree privately beforehand upon
amendments. Sometimes its enemies try to kill it by amend-
ments. T _

480. Or, ﬁnally, to postpone it indeﬁnitely. In a legisla-
tive assembly the motion to lay on the table’ is practically
equivalent to this, and is so used; and in the House of Rep-
resentatives, When a bill has been passed, in order to prevent
an opponent from moving a reconsideration-——Which would
bring it again before the House—it is customary for the
mover of the bill himself to move that the vote by which it
was just passed be reconsidered, and to move to lay that mo-
tion on the table.

481. If you consider the matter you will see that the order
of these motions, as prescribed in the rules, is founded on
co1nmon—sense, and a desire to enable an assembly to transact
business Without improper delays.

482. To prevent undue haste, on the other hand, legislative
bodies usually require a bill to be read three times, and often
on three separate days; measures are referred to committees
for examination ; and on the ﬁnal reading the bill is debated,
unless the majority insists on the previous question. The
reference of a measure to two Houses, and after its passage
by both to the President or Governor, is also a measure of
delay of great importance, because it gives time for thorough
consideration. A

483. Committees are composed of selected members of the
assembly ; and they are either appointed or elected, and for a
special object. They may be permanent, or temporary and

V special. Their meetings, unless otherwise ordered, are private,

so far as the public is concerned; but it is held that any
member of the assembly of which they are a part may attend
their meetings. The ﬁrst person named on the committee is
usually its chairman; and if a member moves the appoint-
ment of a committee, it is customary to name him as one of
its members, and to make him its chairman, unless reasons
exist against that. The committee reports by its chairman,
and the conclusions of the majority form the report. The

minority of the committee have no right to make a report ;‘

but this is usually allowed, because they could bring their
views before the House and the public in other ways. Where
the assembly is divided on a measure, members of both sides
should be appointed in equal numbers, giving the chairman
to the majority; and thus giving an extra vote in the com-
mittee to that side.

484. Legislatures and other permanent bodies sometimes
resolve the whole assembly into a committee, called the
“Committee of the VVhole.” It is done on motion by a
member, and for the consideration, usually, of a particular
subject. When the House goes into Committee of the
Whole, the Speaker or presiding oﬁicer leaves the "chair,
calling a member to take his place. The presiding ofﬁcer
may take the ﬂoor in the committee, and take part in the
debate. The Committee of the VVhole can not conclude
any business, and can not adjourn. When it has completed
the discussion of a bill, or is ready to cease for that time, a
member moves “ that the committee do now rise,” whereupon
the Speaker resumes his place, and his substitute in the com-
mittee reports to him brieﬂy but formally What the commit-
tee has done, thus oﬁicially ‘informing him of the stage at
which the business was left. If the bill under consideration
is ready for a vote, and that fact is reported, the Speaker may
then bring it to a vote without further delay. If the House
While in Committee of the ‘Whole desires to adjourn, it rises;
but only after the chairman has reported progress to the
Speaker is a motion to adjourn in order. While in com-
mittee, there is no need to use the previous question to stop

160 POLITICS FOR YOUNG AMERICANS.

debate, as the majority need only ‘vote that the committee
rise, when the debate stands adjourned, and the reconstituted
House takes up other business. The object of going into
Committee of the Wliole is to be easily rid of those rules

I which otherwise limit debate, and to make discussion freer.

In Committee of the Whole there is no limit to debate.
485. When a bill or resolution is introduced, if the assem-
bly is willing itrmay then be discussed, and in the debate the

‘mover has the right to address the House ﬁrst. In debate

the friends and opponents of the question should have the
floor alternately, and it is usual for the mover to close the
debate. N 0 one is expected to speak more than once on the
same question or bill. '

486. In debate the speakers should conﬁne themselves rig-
orously to the question ; and if any one wanders away in his
remarks to other matters, he may properly be called to order
by the presiding oﬂicer on the request of a member. All per-
sonalties should be avoided ; and to assist in this, it is a rule
that no member shall, in debate, be called or spoken of by his
name. In legislative bodies this rule is very rigidly adhered
to; and in the British House of Commons, when the Speaker
calls a member to order, and has difficulty in procuring order,
by an old tradition, his last resort is a threat to “call the
gentleman by name.” As this threat has always been eEect-
ive, I believe it is not known what would be the result if it
were actually carried into effect.

487. In recognizing those who wish to speak during a de-
bate, the presiding oﬁicer exercises a certain liberty of choice;
but he must take care to be fair to both sides. If the debate
is important, and comes up after notice, members often private-
ly inform the presiding officer that they desire to speak; and
he then makes a list of their names, and may properly arrange
them in the order of their abilities if he wishes ; taking care,
however, that both sides are fairly represented. I He then rec-
ognizes among those who rise to obtain the ﬂoor those on his
list, and may give private notice to each beforehand when his
turn is at hand.

DELIBERATIVE ASSEMBLIES. 1 61

488. The assembly may limit debaters to a speciﬁed time,
giving each ﬁve or ten minutes, or half an hour; and it may,

by unanimous consent, extend the time of any speaker who .

has not completed his remarks, and Whom it Wishes to hear.
But such a favor must be by unanimous‘ consent.

489. When the measure comes to a vote the presiding ofﬁcer
should clearly state it, and he then adds, “Those who are in
favor of this will vote Aye, the contrary, No.” Andhe should
be very particular to put the question so that every member
may understand the bearing or eﬁect of his vote upon the
question.

490. Those only may vote who are within the proper limits
of the meeting When their names are called. If, for instance,
a part only of the hall is reserved for the meeting, and the re-
mainder for an audience, a member standing Without the bar-
riers of separation l1as no right to vote.

491. Finally, remember that one of the main and most im-
portant objects of a deliberative assembly is to debate. It is
not a merit, but a fault, in such an assembly to hastily adopt
a number of measures prepared beforehand by a committee
or caucus ; it is far better, more conducive to a proper under-
standing of the business in hand, and to the public Welfare in
the case of conventions and other public meetings, that the
measures proposed should be discussed, even if apparently
time should be thus lost. VVhen a party convention meets
in these days, it is too often a mere recording body. Its
business is prepared by committees, whose members are
oftenest selected beforehand; and when these bring in their
reports, they are at once adopted, and this is supposed to be

-a declaration of the Will of the people. But you can see

that it is only a cheat. The delegates are not really con-
sulted. It Would be far better, more conducive to party
harmony and the public good, if debate were expected and
tool: place. ' .

492. I have aimed to give you only such a_brief outline of
the rules in accordance with which meetings should be con-
ducted as will let you understand the general principles; and

DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE

A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES on THE UI§'ITED‘ST.-‘JPES or
AMERICA, IN eonennss ASSEMBLED, JULY 4, 1776.

'Wi—IEN, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle
them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. ,

‘We hold these truths to be self-evident——tliat all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights ; that among these are life, liberty, and the p_ursuit of happiness;
that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, dc.»
riving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that, when-
ever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the
right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new govern—
ment, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers
in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to atlect their safety and
happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long estab-
lished should not be changed for light and transient causes; and, acco1'd~
ingly, all experience hath shown that manlihid are more disposed to suf-
fer, while evils are suﬁ"erahle, than to right themselves by abolishing the
forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations, pursuing invariablyxthe same object, evinces a design
to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future
security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and
such is now the necessity which constrains them. to alter their former sys-
tems of government. The history of the presentking of Great Britain is
a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having, in direct object,
the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove
this, let facts be submitted to a candid world:

He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary
for the public good.

He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing
importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be ob-
tained; and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large dis-
tricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of repre-
sentation in the Legislature——a right inestimable to them, and formidable
to tyrants only. ’

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfort-
able, and distant from the deposito1'y of their public records, for the sole
purposeof fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with
manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused, for a long time after‘ such dissolutions, to cause others

TI-IE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. 183

to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation,
have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remain-
ing, in the mean time, exposed to all the danger of invasion from with-
out and convulsions within.

He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states ; for that
purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to
pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions
of new appropriations of lands.

He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent
to laws for establishing judiciary powers.

He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their
oiiices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of new otlices, and sent hither swarms of
officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the
consent of our Legislature.

He has atiected to render the military independent of and superior to
the civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
our Constitution, and unaclinowledged by our laws, giving his assent to
their acts of pretended legislation :

For quarterin g large bodies of armed troops among us:

For -protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any mur-
ders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:

For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world :

For imposing taxes on us without our consent:

For depriving us, in many cases, of the beneﬁts of trial by jury :

. For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses;

For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring prov-
ince, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its
boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and ﬁt instrument for
introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies:

For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and
altering fundamentally the powers of our governments : .

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invest-
ed with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

,_He has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protec-

tion, and waging war against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and
destroyed the lives of our people. ’

He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to .

complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun, with

circumstances of cruelty and perﬁdy scarcely paralleled in the most bar-

barous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas,
to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their
friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands. ,

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored
to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages,
whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages,
sexes, and conditions.

1 84 APPENDIX.

In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress in
the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only
by repea.ted injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every
act which may deﬁne a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. ‘We
have warned them, from time to time, of attempts made by their Legis-
lature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. ‘We have re-
minded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
VVe have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have
conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usur-
pations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspond-
ence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguini-
ty. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our
separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind—enemies in
war, in peace friends.

We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in
General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world
for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority
of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare that
these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent
states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown,
and that all political connection between them and the state of Great
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved ; and that, as free and inde-
pendent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract
alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which
independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declara-
t.ion, with a ﬁrm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, We mu-
tually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

WASHlNGTON’S FAREWELL ADDRESS
I TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.
(Smprnnnnu 17, 1797.)

FRIENDS AND F1«3LLow—C1rIzENs :’-——The period for a new election of
a citizen to administer the executive government of the United States
being not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts
must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with
that important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may con-
duce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now
apprise you of the resolution I have formed to decline being considered
among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made.

I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured that
this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the con-
siderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful citizen to
his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service, which si-
lence, in my situation, might imply, I am influenced by no diminution
of zeal for your future interest; no deﬁciency of grateful respect for
your past kindness; but am supported by a full conviction that the step
is compatible with both.

The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the oﬁice to which
your suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacriﬁce of
inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what ‘appeared
to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much
earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at lib-
erty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been
reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, previous
to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an address to
declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and crit-
ical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous ad-
vice of persons entitled to my conﬁdence, impelled me to abandon the
idea. -

I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as internal,
no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the senti-
ment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, Whatever partiality may

be retained for my services, that, in the present circumstances of our-

country, you will not disapprove my determination to retire.

The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were
explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I will
only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed toward the or-
ganization and administration of the government the best exertions of
which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconscious, in the
outset, of the inferiority of my qualiﬁcations, experience in my own eyes,
perhaps still more in the eyes ofothers, has strengthened the motives to

1 86 . APPENDIX.

difﬁdence of myself; and every day the increasing weight of years ad.-
monishes me, more and more, that the shade of retirement is as neces-
sary to me as it will be welcome. Satisﬁed that, if any circumstances
have given peculiar value to my services, they were temporary, I have
the consolation to believe that, while choice and prudence invite me to
quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.

In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the
career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the
deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my be-
loved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more
for the steadfast conﬁdence with which it has supported me; and for
the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable
attachment, by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness
unequal to my zeal. If beneﬁts have resulted to our country from these
services, let it always be remembered to your praise, and as an instruct»
ive example in our annals that, under circumstances in which the pas-
sions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead, amid appear-
ances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging, in
situations in which, not unfrequently, want of success has countenanced
the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support was the essential
prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were
effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me
to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that Heaven may
continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneﬁcence; that your union
and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution,
which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its
administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and
virtue; that, in ﬁne, the happiness of the people of these States, under
the auspices of liberty, may be made complete, by so careful a preserva~
tion and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the
glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption
of every nation which is yeta stranger to it. ~

Here, perhaps, I ought to stop; but a solicitude for your welfare,
which can not end but withmy life, and the apprehension of danger,
natural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, to
offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent
review, some sentiments which a.re the result of much reflection, of no
inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all-important to the
permanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you
with the more freedom, as you can only see in them the disinterested
warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive
to bias his counsel; nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your
indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar
occasion. A

Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts,
no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or conﬁrm the attach-
ment. V

The unity of government, which constitutes you one people, is also
now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the ediﬁce
of your real independence; the support of your tranquillity at home,

’ your peace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very

wAsH1NeToN’s FAREWELL ADDRESS. 18’?

liberty which you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee, that,
from different causes, and from different quarters, much pains will be
taken, many artiﬁces employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction
of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which
the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly
and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of in-
ﬁnite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of
your National Union to your collective and individual happiness; that
you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to
it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium
of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation
with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a
suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and indignantly
frowning upon the ﬁrst dawning of every attempt to alienate any por-
tion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which
new link together the various parts.

For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Cit—
izens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right
to concentrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs
to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of pa-
triotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.
With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners,
habits, and political principles. You have, in a common cause, fought
and triumphed together: the independence and liberty you possess are
the Work of joint councils and joint efforts, of common dangers, suffer-
ings, and successes.

But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves
to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more
immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country ﬁnds
the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the
union of the whole.

The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected
by the equal laws of a common government, ﬁnds, in the productions
of the latter, great additional resources of maritime a11d commercial en-
terprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South,
in the same intercourse, beneﬁting by the agency of the Nort/2, sees its
agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning ‘partly into its
own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular navigation
invigorated; and, while it contributes, in different ways, to nourish and
increase the general mass of the national navigation, it looks forward to
the protection of a maritime strength to which itself is unequally adapt-
ed. The East, in like intercourse with the l/Vest, already ﬁnds, and in
the progressive improvement of interior communications by land and
water will more and more ﬁnd, a valuable Vent for the commodities
which it brings from abroad or manufactures at home. The Wrest de-
rives from the East supplies requisite to its growth and comfort; and,
what is, perhaps, of still greater consequence, it must, of necessity, owe
the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions to
the weight, inﬂuence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic
side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as
one nation. Any other tenure by which the l’Vest can hold this essential

1 88 r APPENDIX.

advantage, whether derived from its own separate strength, or from an
apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be in-
trinsically precarious. '

VVl1ile, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and
particular interest in union, all the parts combined can not fail to ﬁnd,
in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength, greater re-
source, proportionally greater security from external danger, a less fre-
quent interruption of their peace by foreign nations ; and, what is of in-
estimable value, they must derive from union an exemption from those
broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict neighbor-
ing countries not tied together by the same governments; which their
own rivalships alone would be sutiicient to produce, but which opposite
foreign. alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate and»embit-
ter. Hence, likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown
military establishments which, under any form of government, are in-
auspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded _as particularly hos-
tile to republican liberty; in this sense it is that your union ought to be
considered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one

V ought to endear to you the preservation of the other. »

These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reﬂecting
and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a pri-
mary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common
government can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it.
To listen to mere speculation, in such a case, were criminal. We are
authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the
auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will af-
ford a happy issue to the experiment. It is Well worth a fair and full
experiment. VVith such powerful and obvious ‘motives to union, affect-
ing all parts of our country, while experience shall not have demon-
strated its impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the
patriotism of those who, in any quarter, may endeavor to weaken its
bands.

In contemplating the causes which may disturb our union, it occurs
as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished
for characterizing parties by geographical discriminatio11s—No7~t/earn
and Sout/zem, Atlantic and Western; whence designing men may en-
deavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests
and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire inﬂuence, within
particular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other
districts. You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies
and heart-burnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they
tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together
by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have
lately had a useful lesson on this head: they have seen, in the negotia-
tion by the Executive, and in the unanimous ratiﬁcation by the Senate,
of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event
throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the
suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the General Govern-
ment and in the Atlantic Statesunfriendly to their interests in regard to
the Mississippi; they have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties,
that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure to them every

thing they could desire, in respect to our foreign relations, toward con-

firming their prosperity. VVill it not be their wisdom to rely, for the
preservation of these advantages, on the UNION by which they were pro--
cured ? VVill they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there
are, who would sever them from their brethren, and connect them with
aliens ? '

To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the
whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts,
can be a11 adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the in-
fractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have ex-
perienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon
your ﬁrst essay by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better
calculated than your former for an intimate Union. and for the effica-
cious management of your common concerns. This government, the

offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon

full investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its princi-
ples, in the distribution of its powers uniting security with energy, and
containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just
claim to your conﬁdence and your support. Respect for its authority,
compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties en-
joined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of our
political systemsjis the right of the people to make and to alter their
Constitutions of Government. But the Constitution which at any time
exists, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people,
is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the
right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every
individual to obey the established government.

All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and
associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to
direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of
the constituted authorities, are destr,uctive of this fundamental principle,
and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to" give it an arti-
ﬁcial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will
of the nation, the will of a. party, often a small but artful and enterprising
minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of
different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-
concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of
consistent and wholesome plans, digested by common councils, and
modiﬁed by mutual interests.

However combinations or associations of the above description may
now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time
and things, to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and

unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people,

and usurp for themselves the reins of government; destroying, after-
ward, the very engines which had lifted them to unjust dominion.
Toward the preservation of your government, and the permanency of
your present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily dis-
countenance irregular oppositions to itsacknowledged authority, but also
that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, how-
ever. specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect, in
the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will impair the energy

1 90 APPENDIX.

of the system, and thus to undermine what can not be directly over-
thrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember
that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of
governments as of other human institutions ; that experience is the surest
standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing Constitution
of a country; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hy-
pothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change, from the endless va-
riety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember, especially, that, for the
efficient management of your common interests in a country so exten-
sive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the
security of perfect liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself will ﬁnd in
such a government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its
surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a name Where the gov-
ernment is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to confine
each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws,
and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights
of person and property.

I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state,
with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical dis-
criminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn
you in the most solemn manner against the bancful effects of the spirit
of party generally. »

This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its
root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists, under dif-
ferent shapes, in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or re-
pressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rank-
ness, and is truly their worst enemy.

The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by
the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages
and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a
frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and
permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradu-
ally incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute

power of an individual ; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing

faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this dis-
position to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public
Liberty. ' V

‘.Vithout looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which, never-

theless, ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual

mischiefs of the spirit of party are suﬂicient to make it the interest and
duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.

It serves always to distract the Public Councils and enfeeble the Public
Administration. It a.gitates the community with ill-founded jealousies
and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another;
foments, occasionally, riot and insurrection. It opens the door to for_-
eign inﬂuence and corruption, which ﬁnd a facilitated access to the gov-
ernment itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy
and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of an-
other. c

There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks
upon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the

wAsHING'roN’s FAREWELL ADDRESS. 1 91

spirit of Liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and in
governments of a monarcl1ical cast, Patriotism may look with indulgence,
if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular
character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encour-
aged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be
enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And, there being con-
stant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion,
to mitigate and assuage it-. A ﬁre not to be quenched, it demands a uni-
form vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warm-
ing, it should consume.

It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country
should inspire caution, in those intrusted with its administration, to con-
fine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in
the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another.
The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the de-
partments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a
real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to
abuse it, which predominates in the human heart, is suﬂicient to satisfy
us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in
the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into dif-
ferent depositories, and constituting each the Guardian of the Public
Weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments
ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under our'own
eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If,

"in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modiﬁcation of the con-

stitutional powers be, in any particular, wrong, let it be corrected by an
amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there
be no change by usurpation; for, though this in one instance may be
the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free gov-
ernments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbal-
ance, in permanent evil,'any partial or transient beneﬁt which the use
ca.n at any time yield.

Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity,
Religion and Morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that
man claim the tribute of Patriotism who should labor to subvert these
great pillars of human happiness, these ﬁrmest props of the duties of
Men and Citizens. The mere Politician, equally with the pious man,
ought to respect and to cherish them. A-volume could not trace all their
connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked,
'Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense
of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are the instruments of in-
vestigation in Courts of Justice? And let us with caution indulge the
supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. What-
ever may be conceded to the inﬂuence of reﬁned education on minds of
peculiar st.ructure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that
national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.

It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of
popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or less force
to every species of free government. \Vho that is a sincere friend to it
can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the
fLll)1'lC ?

192 APPENDIX.

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the
general diifusion of kno_wledge. In proportion as the structure of a gov—=
ernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion
should be enlightened.

As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public
credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible;
avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but remembering also
that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much
greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding, likewise, the accumulation
of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous ex-
ertions in time of peace to discharge ‘the debts which unavoidable wars
may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the
burden which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these max-
ims belongs to your Representatives, but it is necessary that public opin-
ion should co-operate. To facilitate to them the pert'ormance of their
duty, it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that toward
the payment of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue there
must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less
inconvenient and unpleasant; that the intrinsic embarrassment, insepa-
rable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice
of ditiiculties), ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of
the conduct of the Government in making it, and for a spirit of acquies-
cence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies
may at any time dictate.

Observe good faith and justice toward all nations; cultivate peace and
ha.rmony with all. Religion and Morality enjoin this conduct; and can
it be that good policy does not equally enjoinit? It will be worthy of a
free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great nation, to give to
mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always
guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. \V ho can doubt that, in
the course of time and things, the fruits‘ of such a plan would richly re—
pay any temporary advantages, which might be lost by a steady adher-
ence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the permanent
felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at least, is recom-
mended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it
rendered impossible by its vices?

.1 n the execution of such a plan, nothing is more essential than that A

permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passion—
ate attachments for others, should be excluded; and that, in place of
them, just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated. The
nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred, or an habitual
fondness, is in some degree a slave.- . It is a slave to its animosity or to
its affection, either of which is suﬁicient to lead it astray from its duty
and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each

more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of

umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling
occasions of dispute occur. Hence frequent collisions, obstinate, en-
venomed, and bloody contests. The nation, prompted by il1—will and

‘resentment, sometimes impels to war the Government, contrary to the

best calculations of policy. The Government sometimes participates in
the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would

WAsHINeToN”s FAREWELL ADDRESS. 1 93

reject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the nation subservient
to projects of hostility instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister
and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty
of nations has been the victim.

. So, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another pro-
duces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating
the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases where no real
common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other,
betrays the former into a participation inthe quarrels and wars of the
latter, without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to
concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others, which-is
apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions, by unnecessarily
parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy,
ill—Will, and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal
privileges are withheld; and it gives -to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded
citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray
or sacrifice the interest of their own country, without odium, sometimes
even with popularity; gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense
of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable
zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, cor-
ruption, or infatuation. _ -

As avenues to foreign inﬂuence, in innumerable ways, such attach-
ments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent
patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domes-
tic factions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion,
to inﬂuence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small
or weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the
satellite of the latter. a 1

Against the insidious wiles of foreign inﬂuence (I conjure you to be-
lieve me, fellow--citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be con-
stcmtly awake; since history and experience prove that foreign inﬂuence
is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that
jealousy, to be useful, must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument

of the very inﬂuence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. E-x- -

cessive partiality for one foreign nation, and excessive dislike of another,
cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve
to veil and even second the arts of inﬂuence on the other. Real patriots‘,
who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become sus-

pected and odious ; while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and con-

ﬁdence of the people to surrender their interests. '
The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in

«extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political

connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements,
let them be fulﬁlled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.

Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none, or a very
remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies,
the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence,
the1'efore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artiﬁcial
ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary com-
binations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.

Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a

1 94 . APPENDIX.

different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government,
the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external
annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutral-
ity We may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected ; when
belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon
us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may
choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.

Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our
own, to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny
with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in
the toils of European ambition, interest, humor, or caprice?

It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any
portion of the foreign world, so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty
to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infi-
delity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable
to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy.
I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genu-
ine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise
to extend them.

Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on
a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alli-
ances for extraordinary emergencies. V

Harmony, and a liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommend-
ed by policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy
should hold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting
exclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of things ;
diffusing and diversifying, by gentle means, the streams of commerce,
but forcing nothing; establishing, with powers so disposed, in order to
give trade a stable course, to deﬁne the rights of our merchants, and to
enable the Government to support them, conventional rules of intercourse,
the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but
temporary, and liable to be from time-to time abandoned or varied, as
experience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view
that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from anoth-
er; that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it
may accept under that character ; that, by such acceptance, it may place
itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors,
and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more. There
can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from
nation to nation. It is an illusion, which experience must cure, which a
just pride ought to discard.

In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and af-
fectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting
impression I could wish; that they will control the usual current of the
passions, or prevent our nation from running the course which has hith-
erto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even ﬂatter myself
that they may be productive of some partial beneﬁt or some occasional
good—that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party
spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against
the impostures of pretended patriotism—-this hope will be a full recom-
pense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have been dictated.

wAsH1NG'roN’s FAREWELL ADDRESS. t 195

How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by
the principles which have been delineated, the public records and other
evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To my-
self, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have a.t least believed
myself to be guided by them.

In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my Proclamation of
the 22d of April, 1798, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your
approving voice, and by that of your Representatives in both Houses of
Congress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, unin-
ﬂuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.

After deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could
obtain, I was well satisﬁed that our country, under all the circumstances
of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and interest to
take, a neutral position. Having taken it, I determined, as far as should
depend ‘upon me, to maintain it, with moderation, perseverance, and
ﬁrmness.

The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is
not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, ac-
cording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from being
denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.

The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any
thing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on
every nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the
relations of peace and amity toward other nations. .

The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be
referred to your own reﬂections and experience. \Vith me, a predom-
inant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle
and mature its yet recent institutions, and to progress without interrup-
tion to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to
give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.

Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am un-
conscious of intentional error, I a1n nevertheless too sensible of my de-
fects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors.
VVhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or
mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me
the hope that my country will never cease to View them with indulgence ;
and that, after forty-five years of mylife dedicated to its service with an
upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to ob-
livion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.

Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by
that fervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it
the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations, I
anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise my-
self to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of partaking, in the
midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign inﬂuence of good laws under a
free ‘government, the ever favorite object of my heart, and the happy re-
ward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.
