6 PREFACE.

jurists Whose Works are accepted by the legal profession
as of the highest authority.

For several years, there has been a growing conviction
among educators, that civil government should be added
to the list" of studies in all our schools of the higher grades,
and in the advanced classes of the common school.

The school-boy of to—day becomes the voter of to-morrow.
The millions of youth now in the schools of America are
soon to decide all the grave questions of national interest
which concern us as a people. The ballot more othaﬁ the
bullet must determine the destiny of our country. The
ballot in the hands of the ignorant may do more mischief
than the torch of the incendiary in the towers of the
metropolis. \

If the publication of this Work shall contribute to a more
extended acquaintance by the masses of American youth
With the fundamental principles of our government, the
purpose for Which it Was Written Will be realized.

INTRODUCTION.
BY REV. JAMns E. LATIMER, D'.D.

IN these days, a new book can vindicate its claims to
public notice and favor only on the ground that the topics
of which it treats are absolutely new, or that it discusses a
known subject in such a manner as to make us instantly
feel that it meets an acknowledged want.

Such is the claim we make for the book before us. It
treats a common subject, —— one that was ably presented by
the distinguished Judge Story, some thirty years since, in
convenient form for tl1e use of schools, and, since, by several
authors of less distinction, though of acknowledged ability.
But the peculiar merit of our author consists in the ama-

Zytical method which he adopts. His aim is purely didactic,

and to teach exactly what the Constitution contains.

This book is one that was not made, but grew. Prof.
Townsend, the author, has for years made civil government
a speciality in lessons and lectures before the teachers’
institutes of New York. Wliat was small and unpretend-
ing in the beginning has thus grown int.o importance on
his hands, until it has become the full, well—rounded treatise
which is here presented.

He has been urged to the preparation and publication of
this work by the myriad voices of educators and teachers
who have listened t.o his instructive lessons upon a subject

~ which is usually so dry and repulsive.

ANNOTATIONS ON THE ANALYSIS
on THE ' C

CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.

PREAMBLE.

WE, the people of the United States,

. In order to form a more perfect union ,'

. Establish justice;

Insure domestic tranquillity ,°

Provide for the common defense ;

. Promote the general welfare ,' and,

. Secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our pos-
terity, do ordain and establish this Oonstitution for
the United States of America. 1. ~

§ 1.

1st. The Preamble is an exposition of the objects and purposes of
the Constitution. Unlike the Articles of Confederation, which were
an agreement or compact between the States as such, the Constitu-
tion is a compact of the PEOPLE. The ﬁrst line of the former docu-
ment shows that the bargain is between the States : on the contrary,
the ﬁrst line of the Preamble to the Constitution shows that the

agreement is by the PEOPLE. A
2d. Observe, the Preamble begins with, “ We, the People ; l’ and

O'JO1tF-§J3l\'D|-4

what they purposed to do was for themselves and their posterity.

109

Statescan"not'pro‘pe1'ly ibesalidii to have posterity’. "The Articles of s‘

Confederation wereinever submitted to the people for their approval
in any such direct manner asthe Constitution was.

3d. The ﬁrst objectexpressed in the Preamble is, to form a more __

perfect union; thatis, a more perfect union than had existed under
the ‘Confederation. » The government, under the former system, had

been found by experience to be inadequate to the wants of the :
people. The Union was so imperfect as to be almost unworthy of .

the name.

4th. Its imperfections as a national government appeared from the .
collision ‘of interests between the States; their commercial aggres- 
siions uponfeach other ; the laws of retaliation for real or imaginary.
injuries, which they did not hesitate to pass; the dangers from for- .

eign interference", as well’ as the actual advantagewhich had often
been taken of our weakness, — all of which threatened the dismem-
berment of the Union under the Confederation.

They demonstrated the necessity of a more powerful federal gov- S

ernment, and a more ‘perfect union of the people of the United
States.  " i" A . ' ' ' ‘
_  § 2,
1st. A government having no judiciary that commands the respect
of the people is wanting in one of the essential elements of. stability.
T_o establish justice was, therefore, the second object to be secured
by the new Constitution. r ' ‘ s i
a 2d. Under the Confederation, there was nothing that could be
called a national judiciary. The State legislatures were often led to

pass laws favoring their -own immediate -and respective localities, and .

State courts did not hesitate to disregard the decisions of co-ordinate
tribunals. ‘
a 3d. Treaties formedbetween the Confederacy and foreign nations

were recklessly disregarded by the State legislatures as well as by.

the State courts. In several instances, this open. disregard of the

plighted faith of the nation threatened to involve the whole country

in war.

» 4th. ‘Laws were passed-by the_‘State legislatures, in many instan--

ces, inropen deﬁance -of the sacrednessof..privatef_contracts. .b,etW.ee_n

Pm IL] NOTES ON PREAMBLE. i 111 v~

man and man. ; Remedies for the -recovery of debts were suspended.

Debtors were authorized to tender any sort of property, even though i

nearly wo1~tl1less, in payment of debts that had been contracted to be
paid in money.

5th. Insolvent laws were enacted by some of the States, theleffect .

of which, when applied to the relations of debtor and creditor, ‘prac-

tically amounted to a complete discharge of indebtedness Without‘,

consideration. . V V

6th. Laws were also passed making the most unjust and invidious
distinctions in favor of the citizens of the States enacting them, and
against foreigners and citizens of neighboring States. In fact, the
American judiciary became a matter of contempt at home, and of S
burlesque abroad. - «

5 7th. There were other evils that called loudly for remedy. j

Some related to the welfare of our foreign commerce ;

Some to the conﬂict of interests between citizens of diﬁierent
States; T

Some to the relief of foreigners who had given credit to. our citi-
zens ; '

Others related to territorial disputes between different States;
and still others, i L _ V i

To titles of lands under grants from different States. _ A

So loose and reckless had the legislative and judicial administra4

tion of affairs become, that it was conceded by all parties, that, un-_

less some effectual remedy were applied, our political institutions

must crumble into ruins. To establish justice, therefore, Was a leadg.

ing purpose of the authors of the Constitution.

' 1st. To insure domestic tranquillity was another of the expressed.

objects of the new Constitution. Domestic contentions, as may be

inferred from What has already been said, were the order of the

day. .

, § 4.

1st. The common defense was not properly provided for under
the Confederation.’ V H

A people not prepared forwar, and known not to be, will con-
stantly be liable to aggressions from neighboring nations. On the
contrary, a‘ nation‘ known to be prepared will be quite unlikely to
be attacked. A weak nation is never formidable, and will never
command the respect of ’ its neighbors. _

* 2d. Congress, under the Confederation, as we have seen, could
recommend, but could not enforce, measures for the common defense.
They could not even declare war, nor exercise any of the war-pow-
ers,,without the concurrence of nine of the thirteen States; nor, even
when they had declared war under these restrictions, should they do
so‘, could’ they -force into service a single soldier. Sound statesman-
ship demanded, ‘therefore, that something shouldbe done to provide‘

' more effectually for the common defense. By reference to the war-C.

power in the Constitution, it will be seen that this provision has
been made.
§ 5. .

“‘1st.’ The duty to" promote the general welfare of its citizens
inherently belongs to every" national sovereignty. It is indeed, or
should be, the -primary purpose of every government. _The indi-
vidual States of Americaphad not the means, nor have they now,
to secure this desirable object. It requires larger resources than
belong to a single State.

2d.‘ Stretching over such a vast extent of territory as the States
of this Union‘ occupied during the last century, and more especially
as they are sure to occupy before the close of the present, isolation
of State interests is out of the question. What concerns one State,

in a greater or lessdegree, must concern all. There is not a State

in this Union which has not an interest in the harbors of New York
and New Orleans.

From‘ our‘ geographical peculiarities .and relations, it would be
impossible to guard the interests of commerce, agriculture, and
manufactures, without the agency of a ' more plenary power than
belongs to a single State.

3d. This clause, “the general welfare;’’ doubtless refers more
especially to the affairs of commerce‘ ; and this is an interest that
pervades all other interests of a great,growing, free, and industrious
people. i The clause means more than this," however. It is general
in its character, inserted not only in the preamble, but in the Con-
stitution itself, in the ‘enumeration of the ‘powers of Congress. In
fact, the Whole Constitution is directed to this end.

4th. From the poverty of language, it would be impossible to
specify, Within any convenient limits, all the powers which a govern-
ment like that of the United States might at some time ﬁnd it
necessary to exercise, and under some possible emergencies.

‘' eAnd although fears may be indulged in some quarters, that,
under a clause of such broad signiﬁcation, some of the departments,
especially the legislative, and perhaps the executive, may overreach

and go beyond their prerogatives, yet the ballot is the remedy in

the one case, and impeachment in the other.

'§ 1. At the time of the formation of the -Constitution, no census? ,

having been taken,‘ there was no accurate information in possession
of the -members of the Convention in regard to. the population of
the several States respectively. ” There was considerable variety of -~

opinion on the subject; and, in ﬁxing the proportion of representa- '

tion in the House of Representatives, entire satisfaction was not
secured. = -

§ 2. It was settled, however, without much difﬁculty, that, when-
e-v,er -the population should be accurately ascertained, the number -of
representatives should not exceed one for every. thirty. thousand‘
inhabitants. It was believed that this proportion would give about
sixty-ﬁve members in all, —the number of which the Housewas to.
be constituted until the census could be taken.

§ 8. Fifty-six was proposed at ﬁrst as the most“ convenient num-
ber ; ‘but, in undertaking to assign to each State itsequitable pro-

portion of this number, the members of the Convention could not —

agree. Then it was proposed that the number be extended to sixty-
ﬁve ; When Mr. Madison proposed that this I number ‘should be

He has drawn the materials for his Work from original
sources, and from commentaries of classic excellence. We
see traces of interminable rummagings of the Madison
Papers, the Federalist, Elliot’s Debates, Story and Rawle
on the Constitution, Kent’s and Blackstone’s Commentaries,
as Well as the most patient gleanings from ofﬁcial, statistical,
and chronological tables.

In reading the author’s manuscript, as I Was permitted
to do, I was struck with its absolute freedom from all
political bias, the pure ether of impartiality that marks
every page, the clear and Well-deﬁned statement of fact,
and, above all, the almost faultless analysis and symmetry

‘ of ‘the entire work.

The author has published the analysis in chart form,
separate from the book, in large type, suitable for display
in the schoolroom; and has thus furnished an invaluable
aid in the study of the book and in class-rehearsals. ,

VVe commend the book as a conscientious one, made on
honor, and calculated to last. N otonly graded schools, but
colleges and the higher institutions of learning, will ﬁnd it
of advantage to introduce it int.o their course of study.
The student of civil government will thank the author
for such a book, as it will surely kindle a taste for the
study of this subject. H Besides, it will do much to remove
the popular ignorance regarding our institutions, too long
prevalent in this country, where the humblest citizen is
invested with the attributes of political sovereignty.

her is increased by the admissions of new States, as each State is
‘entitled to at least one member. ’

‘§ .6. In the decade beginning with 1860, it will be observed, the

” numberssof ”m'en‘ibers was ﬁxed at 242. But, in 1861, many seats
' were vacated on account of the great Rebellion which broke out in the

early part of that year. All the representatives from those States
that passed ordinances of secession resigned their seats ; and, even
now (July, 1868), but few of the seats vacated at that time have
been ﬁlled- ' ‘ . ' s '

§ 7. For various reasons, the Thirty-ninth Congress refused to
admit the representatives from those States; and the Fortieth Con-

I gress has thus far taken the same view of the subject.

I n account of these vacancies, the Thirty-ninth Congress, at its
second session, numbered but 192 members.

Each organized Territory is allowed one representative, who may

§ 1. one‘ of the most perplexing of all the questions that came

1 before the Constitutional’ Convention was that which related to the

apportionment of members of the House of Representatives among
the several States. So great a change was proposed in regard to
the composition of the legislative branch from that’ which had
existed under the Confederation, that this matter of apportionment

became a very diﬂicult question to settle.

, §.2. In the ﬁrst place, under the Coﬁfederation, there was but
one house of Congress. In that house, the States, large and small,
had equal, representation, and w.ere equal in political inﬂuence and

PART II.] HOUSE OE REPRESENTATIVES. an 117

power. The smaller States, as might reasonably be presumed, were
reluctant to surrender that advantage. .

_§ 3. In the second place, it was now proposed to have two houses
of Congress, in one branch of which the smaller States insisted on
equality of representation. This was opposed by the larger States,
as it was claimed that political power should depend on population,
or population and property. ,. __

§ 4. Here was a direct conflict of interests. The smaller States
recognized this proposition as a blow aimed at their State sovereignty,
and one which, if successful, would be humiliating to their State
pride : it would greatly diminish their power in the national councils.

-§ 5. A considerable number of the States were in favor of making
wealth, or wealth and population combined, the basis of represen-
tation. The Southern States, at that time, were richer than the
Northern; and this question was one of sectionaliinterest.

§ 6. The smaller States at length yielded the point, consenting that

-population might be accepted as the basis of representation in the

House. The larger States ‘consented to equality of suffrage in the
Senate. But now the question was, Who shall be included, and who
‘excluded, in the representative population? Shall all persons. be
counted? or shall certain classes be omitted? On this vexed question,
there was probably more asperity of feeling demonstrated than on
any other that came before the Convention. .

§ 7. The question ﬁnally narrowed down ‘ to this : Shall the
slaves be counted the same as free white inhabitants? The States
having the most slaves said “i Yes; ” those having but few said “No.”
Allwthe States except Massachusetts at that time held slaves. . But
the Northern and Eastern States held but few comparatively; and it

was apparent that even these fewwere rapidly diminishing in num-
-bers. ' ’ . .

- § 8. If slaves -were to be counted as free persons, this would give

-the Southern States a great advantage. The South insisted that

they should. be included in the representative basis ; the North; that
they should not. Here was as direct eonﬂict, of opinion, based on

. conﬂict of interest. ~ It became evident, that unless concessions were

made from some quarter, orall quarters, the labors of the Conven-
tion were at an end.

118i’   ANALYSIS on ‘CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.  

§ 9. t It should be remarked here", also, that the foreign slave-trade
became a prominent element in the discussion. _The idea of count-_
ingnegroes imported from‘Af'rica, as -soon as they were landed on

our-shores, as so many white men would count,-when they were

merely property, and in no manner contributed to the intelligence-.
of -the population, and of allowing that count to increase the num- r

ber of Southern representatives -in the House, to the minds of many.‘

of the greatimen in that Convention was offensive in the extreme;
 § 10. It was substantially saying» to any State, North or South.

(‘for North and South were alike involved in the traffic), “‘ The more -_
negroes you will import, the more members you may have in -the ,

national council; and the more you will increase the slave popula-
tion, the greater shall be your political power and inﬂuence.”

. § 11. On the other hand, those States in which the slaves were
most numerous, and were likely to go on increasing, contended, that
although there was a sense in which the slaves were property, yet
they were something more : they were human beings, brought within
thepale of civilized society, and ought to be counted with the repre-'
sentative population. .

§ 1.2. .. It will be seen, that, if the basis of representation were
ﬁxed at one member for every thirty thousand inhabitants, a State"

having sixty thousand slaves would be entitled to two members on 7

account of this slave population. Thus slavery would and should,
the Southeontended, become an element of political power. S

§ 13. As with many other questions in that Convention, thiswas
ﬁnally settled by compromise, and on the following terms : —-— '

1st. Five slaves were to be counted as three persons.

2d. The slaves were to be counted on the same basis for purposes
of direct taxation for the support of the General Government ; and
direct taxation was to be imposed in proportion to the representative
population. “ _ . V _ " ‘ — S S _
- 3d. The Northern States consented to a clause in the Constitution
prohibiting legislative interference with the foreign slave-trade prior
to1808. ’ M .- A  _

4th. The Southern States consented to the imposition of a tax or
duty on imported slaves, notexceeding ten dtillars,-for each pe_1fson.

PART II.]“ Ho’UsE or REPRESENTATIVES. ‘ i 119

The clause “three-ﬁfths of all other persons,” at the head of this
article, refers to slaves. T ' ’ ' ' '  '

§‘ 14'. At that day it was generally supposed, that counting three-1'
ﬁftlis of the slaves for purposes of direct taxation Would be afmat- "
terof considerable advantage to the Northern States ; for it was not!
hen presumed that the expenses for the support of governrnent‘
would be chieﬂy paid“ through the ‘custom-house revenue, as aft.er-I-A

Warts "v A lu ' c.‘
ls no ed to be the case

§ 15. But the advantage proved to be nearly all on the side of the

Southern States: for, in the first place, only three-ﬁfths of their

slave populationwere to be counted for purposes of direct taxation; '

While all the Northern population was to be reckoned for this object,
except the very 'feW_slaves held there.
In the second place (and this was a matter which the Convention

did not foresee), direct taxation has never been a matter of much 1'

importance until since the abolition of slavery. The only instances
of this kind of taxation Were in 1798, 1818, and 1815.
(The subject of taxation will be further noticed in another place.)

' of Ainend1nents),. slavery has been abolished. 7 Hovvigthe negro
population Will be counted among the representative population‘here-

before the country, Which, if adopted, will require that they be

excluded from the count altogether, unless they shall be enfran-
chised. (See appendix to Analysis C.) * A 1

§ 17- It will be observed, that the Constitution nowhere mentions
the Word slave _or'slcwe9~g/.1 Wheiiever it is" necessary to allude

to that ‘ class_,o'f persons, a a’<2fi22'lt'l'on is adopted instead of the

Word itself, except in the Thirteenth Article of Amendments before

§ 1. That a member of the House of Representatives should be at
least twenty-ﬁve years old was adopted in the Convention without
debate. Few men before that age have had sufficient experience to
ﬁt them for so important a trust ; and as it seemed necessary to spe-
cify some age before which a person should be held ineligible to
this position, perhaps twenty-ﬁve may be regarded as the most suit-
able. -

§ 2. In order to be a representative, it is not necessary that he

shall be a natural—born citizen. By the Constitution, however,

he must have been a citizen of the United States seven years. ' If
born under another government, he may become a citizen of this
country by a process called naturalization. By a ‘ law of Congress,
it- requires ‘ﬁve years’ residence before this can be accomplished;
which, added to seven years’ citizenship, requires twelve years
actual residence before an alien can become a representative in Con-
gress. A much longer period than this, however, was strenuously
insisted on by many of the members of the Convention. ‘ 4‘
§ 3. The Constitution requires that the member, when elected,
shall be an inhabitant of the State in which he is chosen. This is a
provision so reasonable as to admit of neither debate in the Conven-
tion, nor of diiference of opinion among the people. The inhabi-
tancy of the State in which chosen is limited to the particular time
when chosen, not requiring the representative to c0ntz'mte it there.
He may hold his seat in the House, therefore, even should he change
his residence to another State during "his continuance as a represen-
tative. - 3 S o . ' 
' ~N or is it necessary that he shall reside in the particular Congres-
sional-district in which, or by Which, he is chosen. ' » * ' ‘
§4. No, person holding any oﬁice under the United States is
eligible to a seat in either house of Congress. On this provision,
there was no difference of opinion among the members of the Con-
stitutional Convention ; although many were in favor of carrying the

C PAR'1‘II.:] HOUSE 0E REPRESENTATIVES. . 121

any restriction much further. The Constitution limits the ineligibility to
‘the period of continuance in office under the United States. Sev-

eral of the- members were in favor of extending this incompetencyito
hold a federal ofﬁce for from one to three or four years beyond the
expiration of the term of service for which a senator or representa-
tive should be elected. ‘ ‘ ' i v

§ 5. But theirdeliberations resulted in prohibiting any‘ officer
under -the General Government from being a member of either house

of Congress during his continuance in Qﬁicc. This provision

originated in a deference to State jealousy, ‘and fear that the General
Government, would obtain an undue influence in the national coun-

-cils. If a Federal ofﬁcer Were allowed to be a member of either

house, he might Wield an undue inﬂuence over those with whom he
would be associated in legislative deliberations. i C

ART. IV.—-— TERM.

second year. $; ’   ~ ‘

§ 1. Therewas muclrdiﬁ‘erence ofopinion in the Convention as

to what length’ of time ought to constitute a representative term.
One class was in favor of limiting it to one year‘ ; urging that the

_ people Were, and would continue to be, in favor of frequent elec-

tions ; that such Was the only defense of the people against tyranny ;
and that this plan, bringing representative and constituency more
frequently face to face, would be likely to give a stronger senselof
official responsibility. C V

§ 2. Another class urged that a term of three years Was prefer-

able to one ; that instability is one of the great vices of a republic ;

that time should be given for members to acquire a competent
knowledge of the various interests of States to Which they did not
belong. It Was claimed that one year would be almost consumed
in preparing for and traveling to and from the seat‘ of national
business. ' ‘ C

§ 3.» It Was also urged against the annual plan, that frequency
of elections tended to make the people regardless of them, and to
facilitate the success of little cabals. It had been found necessary

in some States, where the elections were annual, to force attendance
and voting by severe regulations. ’ - ‘ c C '
§ 4. But, as was usual in the Convention, a compromise of opin-

ion prevailed; and it was accepted that members be chosen every“

second year. The representative term always expires in the years
of odd numbers, as 1867, ’69, ’71, &c, ‘

, ART. V.— BY WHOM ELECTED.

By the people of the several States. 

§ 1. It was not easy for the Convention to agree on the question,
“By whom shall the representatives be elected?” It was urged
by some members, that the people were incapable of properly exer-
cising this high and important trust; that they should have as little

 do as possible about the government; that they were ignorant,"

 constantly liable to be misled; that great evils Would result

. from such an excess of democracy ; and that, while the people were

not wanting in purity of motive, they were liable to become the
dupes of pretended patriots.

§2. On the contrary, it was urged that the election of this
branch of Congress should be by the people; that the House of
Representatives was to be the grand depository of the democratic
principle of the government; that it was to be our House of Com-
mons ; that it ought to know and sympathize with every pa.rt of
the community, and ought, therefore, to be. taken, not only from

different parts of the whole republic, but from the various districts.

of A the larger States.
§ 3. It was claimed that this was emphatically the people’s own
government; that, however elevated the situation of the more

wealthy might be to-day, a few years not only might, but certainly .

would, distribute their posterity throughout the lowest classes. of
society. Every selﬁsh motive-, therefore, and every family attach-
ment, ought to lead the Convention to provide no less carefully for
the rights and happiness of the lowest than of the highest order of
citizens. l l

‘§ 4. The members of the Convention who were opposed to an
election of representatives by the people were in favor of electing

them by the legislatures of the several States ;' maintaining that it
Would be utterly impracticable to elect them by the people. By a
close vote, however, it was decided to place the election of members
of the house in the hands of the people of the Several States.

The electors in each State shall have the qualﬁications
reqmsvite for electors of the most mtmerous brcmch of the
State legislatures. 3. «

§ 1. The Word “ electors,” as used here; is synonymous with vo-
ters. It ivas necessary to adopt some rule that Would apply to all the
States in determining or deﬁning the qualiﬁcations of voters for
members of the House of Representatives. On this subject, there
were three classes of opinions : —— '

§ 2. The ﬁrst class proposed to require the same qualiﬁcations
that were requisite to vote for members of the several State legisla-
tures. This was objected to on two grounds : —— ‘

1st. That it would thus be left to the States to settle -the question
of qualiﬁcations. I r

2d. That it would be impracticable in many of the States, as the
qualiﬁcations to vote for a State senator were higher than were
required to vote for the members of the most numerous branch.

Another proposition Was, that freeholders only should be allowed

' to vote for members of the House of Representatives. This found

_favor With many of the ablest members of that body, but failed.
§ 3. The test ﬁnally adopted was, perhaps, the best among the
number proposed, or that could be proposed ; which leaves it in the
hands of the States themselves, with this limitation, that Whatever
test they see ﬁt to adopt as a qualiﬁcation to vote for the most
numerous branch of their own legislatures respectively, shall settle
the question as to Whether the elector may vote for a member of the
House of Representatives. I V A " i
- § 4. N 0‘ State, therefore, has the right to require any higher or
different qualiﬁcations of its citizens, to vote for a member of the
House of Representatives, than it requires of them to vote for the
popular branch of its own legislature.

,§5. Members of the House of ‘Representatives are elected in
the several States by Congressional districts. \Vhen it has been
ascertained how many members each State  entitle<l to, the ‘legis-
latures of the several States divide them respectively into as many
Congressional districts asthey are each entitled to members. These
Congressional districts are numbered, for convenience, ls-t, 2d, 3d,
&c., and areknovvn by their number_s. r

The electors of each district vote for but one candidate, though

that. candidate need not necessarily be a resident of the voter’s dis-

trict. He must, however, as We have seen, be an inhabitant of the
State inlwhich he shall be chosen.

§ 6. Several of the States formerly elected their representatives
by general ticket; that is, each elector voted for all the members
to which the State Was entitled, or for a number equal to that num-
ber. Until 1842, there was no act of Congress requiring elections
of members by Congressional districts ; but, June 25 of that
year, ‘a law Was passed requiring the States to elect by districts,
and allowing each district to elect but one representative.

1880, 18410, 1850, and 1880.

§ 2. By a law of Congress, the Department of the Interior has
the general supervision of the matter. Under that department, the
execution of the business is placed more immediately in the care of

the United-States marshals for the several States, who divide their

respective districts into sub-districts for greater convenience, each
sub-district numbering not to exceed twenty thousand inhabitants.
The marshals appoint assistants, or deputies, for each of these sub-
divisions. ' V
1 § 3. The duties of these assistants, or deputies, consist in visiting
personally every dwelling-house and family within the limits of their
respective jurisdictions, and propounding to some member of the
family, of suitable age and intelligence, such questions as are required
by act of "Congress. 8 8 V 1

§ 4. These" questions “relate. not only to the number of . inhabitants,
but their ages, sex, color, ability to read and write, facts relating to
agriculture, manufactures, commerce, resources of the country, its
productions, and, in fact,”every thing that may be necessary to give a
general view of the condition of the United States. M 8

§ 5. Nor is it left to the discretionof persons questioned, whether-

they will answer these interrogatories. They are compelled to
answer under a penalty of thirty dollars for ‘each refusal; and the
person so refusing can be imprisoned until the penalty’ is paid ; and
a new refusal can be followed by anew penalty and imprisonment.
§» 6. The Constitution requires that" the cenlsusqshall be taken
oncein ten years. By act of Congress, it was taken the ﬁrst time
in 1790 ; and it has been taken deceniallyl ever since. In the Con?
stitutional Convention, 13l1e’,p1‘_OI)OSl_hl,OI.l was considered, to take it
once in twenty years, and once in fifteen ; but once in ten was ﬁnally
adopted. Once inten years was thought to be su'flicie'ntlylfrequent
for all practical purposes. It is attended with considerable expense ;

’ costing for instance, in 1850, nearly a‘ million and a half of dollars.

§ 1. The speaker.is chosen from among the members themselves,

being himself a representative. It is his duty to preside over the

deliberations of the House, a.nd to keep order. The other officers
are a clerk, sergeantrat-arms, postmasteiyand doorkeeper. These

officers are not members of the House. .

(Listof Speakers of the House, Chap. XV., Art. VIII., Part II.)

§ 2. The House of Representatives has the sole power of origi-
nating articles of impeachment. An impeachment is a solemn and
speciﬁc accusation brought against a public officer, drawn out in due
form, charging him with treason, bribery, or other crimes and misde-
meanors. It is in the nature of an indictment, being only primal
facie evidence of guilt, —— sufﬁcient, however, to put the accused on
trial at the bar of the Senate. Although it requires a two-third
majority of the Senate to convict the accused, it requires only a
numerical majority to prefer the impeachment by the House.

§ 3. The following course, substantially, is pursued in preferring
impeachments :— t '-

1st. Some member of the House, who believes that charges should
be made against a public officer, proposes that a committee be appoint-

‘ ed to inquire into the matter, and to make report of the results of

their investigations to the House at some future time. Such com-

Palm IL] HOUSE oE REPRESENTATIVES. 127

mittee is generally appointed without opposition; and usually the
mover will be appointed its chairman, as he is presumed, from. the
fact that he makes the move, to have some knowledge of the case.

2d. If the committee ﬁnd, on investigation, that the charges are
Well founded, and are of such a character as to render the party im-
plicated worthy of impeachment, they so report to the House, speciﬁ-
cally deﬁning the charges, and recommend that he be impeached.

3d. The House examines the report, the subject is discussed, and
a vote taken. If the proposed impeachment is adopted by the
House, and is not drawn out in due form, the House appoints
another committee, to whom this part of t-he business is ‘submitted,
who report the impeachment i_n speciﬁc articles. Another vote is
taken by the House on the impeachment, article by article.

4th. A. committee is new appointed by the House to take the
whole matter before the Senate, and to represent the House in its
prosecution. The House has now taken all the steps properly
belonging to that body in the proceedings. The proceedincrs of the

Senate in the case will be noticed in treating of the judicial powers
of that body.

. § 4. It seems proper that the House should possess the sole
power of impeachment, as that body is constituted of the representa-
tives of the people, who may be presumed to be better acquainted
with public sentiment in their respective localities than members of
the Senate. In England, the power of impeachment is vested in
the House of Commons, the people’s branch of the legislative
department ; and the trial of impeachment belongs to the House of
Lords, which is analogous to the United—States Senate.

§ 5. The‘ House of Representatives has the sole power of originat-
ing bills for raising revenue. ' This body, as has been stated, is
constituted of the more immediate representatives of the people;
and, as the people are to pay the taxes if any are imposed, it would
seem ﬁt and proper that their representatives should be the prime
movers in any measures that require money to prosecute them.

§ 6. In the Constitutional Convention, there was considerable op-
position to this clause of the Constitution. Even Mr. Madison, who
was ever watchful of the rights of the people,  ﬁrst objected to it.

128 ANALYSIS oEcrvrL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

He. and some others -thought that the Senate‘ would be a more capa-‘
ble body of men, and that it would be bad policy to thus discrimi-
nateagainst them. a .

p One member characterized it as a ‘,‘ degrading discrimination.”
Another said it would take away the responsibility of the Senate,
the great security for good behavior; that it would be a dangerous
source of disputes between the two houses.

The workings of government in Great Britain were often referred
to in the Convention. All bills for raising revenue there must ori-
ginate in the House of Commons, which, as has been stated, is the
people’s branch. V ,

§_7. _Although the report of the committee in Convention, propos-
ing that money-bills should originate with the House only, was de-
clared passed, it did not pass by a majority of the States represented.
Enough voted against it to defeat the measure, had the States that
were divided in opinion (and therefore lost their vote) been added
to their number. But itprevailed, and has thus far worked well.

§ 8. The House is co—ordinate with the Senate in general legisla-
tion. There are special powers peculiar to each house; and these
are so clearly deﬁned in the Constitution as to take awayall ambi-
guity. _ There can be no mistaking the powers of one house forthcse
of the other. But in the general, ordinary business of law-making,
the houses are co-ordinate, with the foregoing exception.

§ 9. Among the peculiar and exclusive powers of the House of
Representatives is that of choosing a President of the United States
in a certain contingency. When the electors of President and Vice-
President_fail to elect a President by a majority of all the electors
appointed by the people for that purpose, the election of the Presi-
dent devolves on the House. id

§ 10. This has occurred twice since the adoption of the Constitu-
tion. Thomas Jefferson was elected the first time (1801) by the
House of Representatives, on the thirty-sixth ballot. The opposing
candidate was Aaron Burr. At that time, there were sixteen States
in the Union. ‘When the house elects a President, it is done by

. States, each; State having but one vote.  Jefferson received the votes
of eight ; Burr, six ; and two States were divided. The same result-

PART IL] -THE SENATE. 129

continued through thirty-ﬁve ballotings ; but on the thirty-sixth, as
above stated, J efferson was elected’. .
This was done under the third clause of Article II. of the Consti-
tution,'which has been superseded by Article XII. of the Amend-
ments. A
§ 11. The second instance of the election of a President of the
United States by the House of Representatives occurred in 1825.
Four candidates werevoted for on the electoral ticket, neither of
Whom received a majority of all the votes. These candidates were
Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, who received ninety-nine votes;
John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, eighty-four; William H.
Crawford of Georgia, forty.-one; and Henry Clay of Kentucky,
thirty-seven. N 0 one receiving a majority of the electoral votes, the
election Was thrown into the House ; when John Quincy Adams was
elected. .Mr. Clay’s name did not come before the House, as he
received the smallest number of electoral votes of the four candi-
dates. For when the election comes into the House, since the
Twelfth Article of Amendments was adopted, that body must elect
from the persons having the highest numbers, not exceeding t/zree
on the list of candidates. .
, The electionof President will be more critically examined when
we come to treat of the executive department.

CHAPTER II.

UNITED-STATES SENATE.

ART. I.——HOW COMPOSED.

The Senate is composed of two senators from each State. §.
§ 1...The composition of the Senate is the result of compromise
between the larger and smaller States represented in the Constitu-
tional Convention. - Under the Confederation, it will be remembered,
the representative power in Congress was the same in all the States ;
and that body consisted of but one house. The small State of

. Rhode Island had one vote, and the great State of Virginia had no

m01'Q .
9

130 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II._

§ 2. The small States were tenacious of this power, and were
reluctant to allow any encroachment on their sovereignty. It was
inserted in the credentials of the members of the Constitutional Con-

vention from Delaware, that they were prohibited from changing ~

that article in the Confederation establishing an equality of votes
among the States. A I

§ 3. The large States yielded one point in the controversy, and
the small States another.‘ The large States consented to equality in
the Senate, and the small States to representation in the House in
proportion‘ to population. In the Senate, therefore, there is no dis-
tinction between the States ; and as every bill, before it can become
a law, must passboth Houses of Congress, the rights of the smaller
States are not likely to be compromised in the legislative depart-
ment.

ART. II.——ELIGIBILITY.
1. Must have attained to the age of thirty years.
2. Must have been nine years a citizen of the United States.
3. When elected, shall be an inhabitant of the State for
which chosen. 3%.
4. No United-States oﬁicer shall be a member of either house
of Oongress. 2?. (See appendix D.)

§ 1. N 0 difference of opinion prevailed in the Convention in ref-
erence to the age named. At thirty, the character of a man has
usually become deﬁned and established. He may be presumed, at
this age, to have had sufficient experience to give weight and dignity
to the public councils, and to have acquired that ﬁrmness and inde-
pendence Which will give stability of purpose in the performance of
his duties. ' _

§ 2. By reference to the age required for membership ‘of the
other house, it will be seen that there is a difference of ﬁve years ; a
man being eligible to a seat in that house at twenty-ﬁve. It is con-
sidered, that, a.t least in some respects, the duties of a senator are
more responsible than the duties of a member of the House of Rep-
resentatives. S ._

1st. There can be but two senators from one State, while the
number of representatives will depend on the population. Th

PART IL] - p THE SENATE.     181

State of N ew York, for instance, can have buttwo senators; but at
present, 1868, has thirty-one members of the other house... .

2d. The responsible duty of trying all impeachments devolves on
the Senate ; and from their decision there is no appeal.

3d. A senator holds for the term of six years ; a representative,
for but "two. If a senator proves I incompetent or unfaithful, and
fails to give satisfaction, six years’ ' term of office will prove burden-
some to his constituency. On the other hand, the representative

term is so short, that unfaithfulness or incompetency will cause but

comparatively little inconvenience before he must meet his constitu-
ency at the ballot-box. T ‘ ’

4th. On the Senate rests the grave responsibility of «deciding on
the ﬁtness of executive nominations to ofﬁce. ’

5th. In the Senate‘ is vested, jointly with the executive, the ‘pre-
rogative of treaty-making.

§ 3. Eligibility to the senatorial ofﬁce requires a United-States
citizenship of nine years’; This feature was debated in the Conven-
tioinivvith great spirit and earnestness. Some members were in favor
of recpuiring but fouryears, some ‘seven, some nine, some ten, others

"thirteen, stillothers fourteen; and a few preferred that American

nativity berequired. Nearly all seemed averse to admitting stran-
gers to a seat in the Senate. There were a small number of mem-

bers, hovvever, in favor of requiring no speciﬁed period, but simply

that the incumbent should be a*cz'tz'ze7z. ,
§ 4. N 0 one can regard the condition a hardship that requires a
residence and citizenship. of sufﬁcient time to enable theparty to
demonstrate his attachment to our institutions,_and form of govern-
ment, and to give evidence of his determination to make our country
his permanent home. ‘ .. . - . ' .
§ 5. The laws of Congress require ﬁve years’ residence before an
alien can become naturalized,,and the Constitution nine years’ citi-
zenship before he can hold the ofﬁce of United-States senator;
making fourteen years’ residence necessary’ before he is eligible to a
seat in that body. . t
‘V §’ 6. That ' a senator should be an inhabitant of the State for
which he is chosen is a condition so reasonable,:that iitﬂwas accepted’

132 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

by the Convention Without debate. Itwas inserted‘ in every pro-
posed draft ‘bf the Constitution; the only alteration being the striking
out of the Word “ resident,” and inserting the Word “ inhabitant.”

§ 7. But it must be; observed, that necessity of inhabitancy is
limited to the time when c/Zaosen. A senator chosen for New York,
for instance, does not vacate his Seat in the Senate by changing his
residence to any other State during the ‘term for which he was
elected.‘ It might be in the highest degree proper that he should
resign ; but that is a matter within his own discretion.

—§ 8. A member of Congress must not be encumbered with any
office under the government of the United States. If he holds any
such office at the time of his election. to Congress, he must resign it
before he can take his seat. This applies to membership of either
house. a V
» § 9. The senatorial office is not an ofﬁce under the government
of the.United States Within the meaning of the Constitution. This
Was decided by the Senate itself‘ at a very early period (1799), when
Senator Blount Was impeached by the House, and brought before the
Senate for trial. a

., § 10. The authors. of the Constitution considered the duties of ‘
any ofﬁce under the United States as incompatible with the faithful-

discharge of the duties of senator or representative. In several.
proposedclrafts of the Constitution in . the Convention, a clause Was

inserted, rendering a member of either house ineligible to any office '

under the United States for several years after the expiration of his
legislative term. But it was ﬁnally agreed to conﬁne the disability
to the period of membership.

M ARI‘. III.—TERM.
. The .scncttorz'aZ term is six years. 8.
§ 1. The senatorial term Was another subject of earnest debate in
the Convention, and onwhieh, at ﬁrst, there Was great difference of

opinion. The terms of three, four, ﬁve, six, seven, and nine years,

were severally proposed ; and each had its advocates. Several mem-
bers Were in favor of. extending the term for life, or during ‘good
behavior. . i

PART II.] THE SENATE. 

§ 2. All were in favor of a term sufficiently long to insure to the
ofﬁce dignity, stability, and independence. ‘A term of two or ‘three
years was believed to be quite too short for a fair trial on any meas-
ure of importance on which there might be an almost equal division
of opinion.

§ 3. On the other hand, it was contended that a term of eight or
ten years, or for life, might lead a senator to forget his home respon-
sibility. He might be persistent in measures known to be adverse
to the best interest-s of the country, merely from pride of opinion, or
from the more objectionable spirit of obstinacy. Six years Was pro-
bably not the choice of half the members of the Convention ; but

that term was adopted as a compromise of the extremes.

ART. IV.—BY WHOM CHOSEN.’

By the legislatures of the several States. 8.

§ 1. There were several propositions in the Constitutional Con-
vention on the subject of this article. The ﬁrst Was by Edmund
Randolph of Virginia, who opened the business of the Convention.
He presented an ‘outline of What he thought the new Constitution
should contain. Inthat outline, it was proposed that the senators
should be elected by the House of Representatives, on nomination
by the legislatures of the several States. - .

§ 2. A second plan proposed Was, that the -senators. shall be cho-

sen‘ by the people of the several States, by direct vote, in the same .

manner as the members of the House of Representatives are chosen.

§ .3. A third plan Was, that senators shall be appointed «by the
President of the United States, from nominations made by the legis-
latures of the several States.

§ 4. A fourth plan proposed to unite several representative dis-
tricts into a senatorial ‘district, and let the people elect‘ the senators
by direct vote. . r .

§ 5. A fifth plan was, that the people by direct vote elect senato-
rial electors, and that these electors should elect the senators.

§ 6. And still another plan was, that United—States senators shall
be chosen by the legislatures of the several States. This plan pre-
vailed. The principal reason that led to a decision in favor of" this

134 ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PAM II.

proposition Was, that senators‘ -represent their respective States in
theirlpolilical capacity, and are not regarded as representatives of
the people. It Was the intention of the authors of the Constitution

that the Senate should be a farimore grave, digniﬁed, and aristo-

cratic body than the House. ‘

MODE  ELECTION OF SENATORS. '

NOTE. —By act of Congress, passed July 26, 1866, relating to
the election of United-States senators by the State legislatures, it is
provided, —— S ' I '

'" 71st. That each House shall, by a vote m'vc’Z voce ‘of each member
present,'on the second Tuesday after the meeting and organization
thereof, name a person for senator. .

' 2d. On the day following, the two houses shall meet in joint
assembly ; and, if the same person shall have received a majority of
all the votes cast in each house, he shall be declared duly elected
senator of the United States. ' . ‘

3d. If no person has received such majorities, then the joint as-
sembly shall choose, by a vivd voce vote, a person for senator ; and
the person who shall receive a majority of all the votes of the joint
assembly, amajority of the members of each house being present,
shall be declared duly elected.   ,    

4th. If such senator is not elected on the ﬁrst day, the joint as-
sembly shall meet,‘ and take at "least one vote per day, during the
entire session of the legislature, or until a senator shall be elected

» 5th. In -relation to-vacancies, the act provides, that, when one
exists at a meeting of" the legislature, the same proceedings shall
be had on the second Tuesday after their meeting and organization.

6th. When a vacancy shall happen during the session of the
legislature, like proceedings shall be had, beginning With the second

Tuesday after notice of such vacancy—shall have been received.

7th. The. Governor of the State shall certify the election of a

‘ senator to the President of the United States.

ART. V.—WHEN CHOSEN.  
0ne—tlm'rcl the number of senators , shall be chosen every
second year. 9.

Pam: IL]     THE SENATE. , 135

E This must necessarily be so, on account of the mode of classifying
the senators which the Constitution prescribes, andwhich it directs
to take place at the ﬁrst organization of the Senate under the new
government. Only one-third of the senators being chosen every
second year, and but one-third retiring everysecond year, the Senate
must always be constituted of members, one-third of whom have had
at least four years of legislative experience, and of another third
who have had at least two.

ART. vI.——How oLAssED. C

Immediately after they shall be assembled in ‘consequence
of the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may
be into three classes.‘ — . E
1. The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated

at the expiration of the second year.

2. . Of the second class, at the ewpiration of the fourth year.
3. Of the third class, at the expiration of the sixth year. 9.

§ 1. There was unanimity of opinion in the Constitutional Con-
vention on the propriety of rendering the Senate a perpetual body.
The prerogatives with which it is invested, and the duties required
of it, render this indispensable ; and it was therefore agreed to with
but little or no discussion.

§ 2. The number of . senators at ﬁrst was twenty-six, there being

thirteen States in the Union, and two senators from each State; ‘

though all were not present at the ﬁrst classiﬁcation. Were each
of these senators to serve for six years, their terms would all expire
at the same time. But the plan was, that one-third should retire
every second year: hence it was necessary to adopt some method
by which to determine who should go out at . the end of two years,
who at the end of four, and who at the end of six.

§ 3. The ﬁrst proposition before -the ‘Convention was, that this
should be done by lot; and it was so inserted in the proposed draft
of the Constitution. But this was erased on motion of Mr. Madi-
son, so as to leave the Senate at liberty to adopt some method by
which to prevent theelection of two‘ senators at the same time, and
from the same State, for a full term of “six years.

136 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

§ 4.7 It should be iietnarkeid‘ here, that when "a "new State is

admitted into the Union, and it chooses two senators, the legislat-

ture of the State designates which shall serve for the shorter, and

which for the longer term.
At the ﬁrst session of Congress under the Constitution, the

division of‘ the senators into three classes was made in the follow-

ing manner : -— e . s -
1st. The senators present—were divided into three classes by name ;

the first consistingof six persons, the second of seven, and the *

third of six. ” (Two or three senators had not yet reached

the seat-of government ; and it willbe remembered that Rhodc

Island and North Carolina had not yet ratiﬁed the new
Constitution.) ’

2d. Three papers of an equal‘ size, numbered one, two, and three,

-Were, by theesecretary, rolled up and put into a box, and

drawn by a committee of three persons chosen for the purpose in

behalf of the respective classes in which each of them was placed. -
3d. The classeswere to vacate their seats in the Senate according

to the order of the numbers drawn for them, beginning with

— ~ number one. » V . . _
4th. It was also provided, that, when senators should take their
seats from States which had not then appointed senators, they
should be placed by lot in the foregoing classes, but in such a

manner as should keep the classes as nearly equal as possible. -
5th. In arranging the original classes, care was taken that both

senators from the same State should not be in the same class,
so that there never should be a vacancy, at the same time, of
the seatsof both senators.1 - '

ART. VII. —- VACANCIES.

If vacancies happen by resz'gn‘ati0rz., or otherwise, clawing] .

the recess of the legislature of cmy State, --
1. The ewecatvfve thereof may make temporary a19_p0z'ntme72ts

2. The legislature shall then fill such vacancies. 9.

t» § «1. If vacancies happen while the legislature of the State whose

seats are thus vacated is in session, the legislature will ﬁll the

vacancies without official action on the part of the governor or
executive. The governor has no authority in the case while that
body is in session, --—not even to appoint for a single day.

, §2. He has no appointing power in anticipation of a vacancy
soon to occur. He must wait until it actually happens. The
Senate itself has decided this question." It is also doubtful if the
legislature could choose a senator in anticipation of a vacancy.

§ 3. The senator chosen to ﬁll a vacancy does not hold for the

term of six years, but until the expiration of his , predecessor’s term
only. _ _ '
ART. VIII.—VOTE.
yflach senator shall have one vote. 8.
S This clause would seem to be superﬂuous, unless it he remem-
bered, that, under the Confederation, each State, whateverthe num-
ber of its mernbers in Congress, had but one vote ; "and, if less than

two members were present, it had no vote. The S-tates were each ,

allowed from two to seven members ;, and, if their delegation was
equally divided, they lost their vote. One member was incapable
of voting alone._ - S _

It was the intention of t.l1e.C_onstit_ution to give equality of suffrage
in: the Senate; with the further advantage, that a senator shall not
lose his vote, nor his State go entirely unrepresented, on account of

the absence of one of the members from the senate-chamber.

§ 1. There was strong opposition in the Constitutional Conven-

, tion to creating any such ofﬁce as the Vice-Presidency; and, when

this point was carried, there was considerable opposition to the

138 ANALYSIS on CIVIL S GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

proposition making’ the Vice-President the President of the Senate:
though this last met With. less ‘hostility than the ﬁrst 3 only two

’ States voting against it. ' s

§_ 2. Atﬁrst, it Was intended to allow the Senate to choose their
own presiding officer ;, but afterwards, when the Convention con-
sidered a second feature of the provision, —-—Which was, that in case
of the death, removal, or disability of the President of the United
States, the President of the Senate, as was proposed, was to perform
the duties of the ofﬁce thus made vacant,-——the Vice-Presidency
met Wi_th more favor. _

§ 3. As presiding oﬂicer over the Senate, it was believed that he
Would be more impartial in his decisions than that oﬁcer would
were he a member of their own body. He 1"'night, in that case, be
too much inﬂuenced by the interest he _Would feel in his own State.
But how his being Vice-President, instead of senator, would deprive
him of this feeling of State interest, was not shown; nor was it
shown Why the same objection might not apply as against the Speaker
of the House of Representatives, who is a member of that body. _

It seems more reasonable that the Constitution places that ofiicer

over the Senate “ for Want of something else to do ” while there is

a President of the United States. _

§4. The Vice-President has no vote in the Senate unless they
are equally divided. It is difficult to understand Why he should
have a vote even in such cases, since he is not a member of the
Senate. . A measure that can not be carried afﬁrmatively by a ma-
jority of the members of a legislative -body, especially after thorough
discussion, it is generally presumed, ought to fail. ,

§ 5. The Vice-President’s vote, therefore, can never be given but
to aid the aﬁrmative. Wlien the Senate is equally divided, the
proposed bill or measure has failed unless the Vice-President comes
to its rescue. An equal division in the other house defeats any
proposition in legislative proceedings.

§ 6. The President pro tempore of the Senate is an officer of
that body, chosen by its members, from among themselves, in the
absence of the Vice-President, or when he shall exercise the duties
of the presidential oﬁice. . ‘ '

PART IL]   THE SENATE.   . 139

§7.i Three times in our history, the Vice-President has been
called to perform the duties of the President on the death of that
ofﬁcer. Gen. Harrison died April 4, 1841, —- just one month after
his inauguration as President of the United States. He-was suc-
ceeded by John Tyler, . the Vice-President. Gen. Taylor was
inaugurated March 5, 1849 ; and died July 9, 1850. He was suc-
ceeded by Millard Fillmore. Abraham ‘Lincoln died April 15,
1865, having been inaugurated the second time, March 4, 1865;
and, on his death, was succeeded by Andrew Johnson.

§ 8. It is customary, when we _have a new Vice-President, for
that ofﬁcer to vacate his chair just before the close of the first ses-
sion of the Senate, after his inauguration, to give them an oppor-
tunity to elect a president pro tempore. This is done, that, in case
the Vice—President shall be called to the duties of the President, the
Senate will not be left without a presiding officer.

§ 9. The President pro tempore of the Senate is sometimes
called the Vice-President of the United States. This is often
done, doubtless, by way of courtesy, but sometimes because he is
really thought to. be in fact such officer. But this is a mistake,

§ 10. Although, in case of the death, removal, or disability, both
of the President and Vice-President, the President pro tempore of
the Senate would exercise the duties of President, he is by-no
means either Vice-President or President. It does not make him
Vice-President simply because, in a certain contingency, he may be
called to perform the duties of President: if so, we have had two,
if not" three, Vice-Presidents most of the time during our history;
for the Speaker of the House may become acting President also.

§ 11. The President pro tempore it is never pretended is Vice-
President of the United States, unless the Vice-President has died,
or succeeded to the Presidency ; as in the cases of Tyler, Fillmore,
and Johnson, before cited. The Vice-President is an officer of the

United States ; and no officer of the United States, the Constitution

says, shall ‘be a member of ‘either House of Congress. But the
President pro tempore of the Senate is at member of the Senate.

§ 12. The President pro tempore of the Senate must vote on the
call of the yeas and nays the same as any other member: on the

contrary, the Vice—iPresident never can vote exce

140 ANALYSIS or CIVIL. GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

pt in cases when
the Senate is equally divided. T S
u ‘§ 13. The Vice-President must‘ beat least thirty-ﬁve years of
age, the same as the President; for the Constitution declares that
“no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President
shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States : ”
but a President pro "tempera of the Senate need not be over thirty.
The Vice-President must be native born, or a citizen of the United
States at the adoption of the Constitution : the President pro tem-
pore of the Senate need not be either. Any member of the Senate
is eligible to the presidency pro Zempore of that body.

a § 14;. The Vice-President, in case of the death of the President,
serves out the entire balance of the term for which the Presi-
dent and Vice-President were elected : on the contrary, the President
pro tempore of the Senate, in case he succeeds to the duties of
President, serves only until ‘a President can be elected, or until the
disability of the officer Whom he has succeeded shall be removed.

§C15.' The Vic'e—’President can’ be removed from oiﬁce by im-
peachment only. The President pro tempore of the Senate is not
a United-States officer, and can not, therefore, be impeached. ‘ The
Senate has decided'that_a m"ember”of_ Congress is not impeachable.

§ 16. The Constitution recognizes but two modes of electing a
Vice-President : — ’ ~

’ 1st. By electors of President and V ice-President of the United
States. » A - -

.2d. When the electors fail to elect a Vice-President, the Senate
shall elect one ; but this oﬁ‘icer is not the President pro tempore of
the Senate. ' ' ' ' C — A C‘

.§'1'7. The term of the President pro temporoof the Senate can
not continue beyond his senatorial term ‘; as in the case of Senator
Foster of Connecticut, President pro tempore of the Senate, whose
term expired March 4, 1867 : but the Vice-Presidency"expires. at
the end of the presidential term on‘l’y.’ it ‘ P‘ ’ ’ ,

§ 18,. If thePresident pro témpore of the S'ena.tegis Vice-Presi-
dent of the United States, there were two Vice-Pres-idents for some
forty days after Mr. Fos-ter"s_ election to that position; for he was

PART IL] . . . . THE SENATE.  = . U 141

elected While Andrew Johnson was yet Vice-President, and before
President Lincoln’s death. pt

‘ §19. These are regarded as conclusive proofs, drawn chieﬂy
from the Constitution itself, that the President pro tempore of the
Senate is not Vice-President of the United States, even when the
Vice-President proper has succeeded to the Presidency ; nor does
the Constitution anywhere intimate that this ofﬁcer of the Senate is
to. be so regarded. It is only by a law of Congress that he suc—
ceeds even to the temporary performance of the duties of the Presi-
dency, in case of the death, removal, or other disability, both of
the President and Vice-President.

1. —-LEGISLATIVE.

§ 1. The Constitution makes no general distinction between the

powers of the two houses in legislation. It vests all legislative ‘

power in a Congress of the United States, consisting of a Senate
and House of ‘ Representatives.

§ 2. But there is one power relating to legislation vested in the
House exclusively ,4 and that is the power to originate bills for raising
revenue. Yet, when these bills reach the Senate, that branch of the
legislative power may treat them in all respects as though they
originated there. They can propose amendments, concur with
amendments, or reject them, if proposed by the House, at any stage
of the proceedings ; or they can reject the bills altogether.

§ 3. The Constitution simply requires that this class of legislation

' shall or27gz'nate with the House ; beyond which, that b'ranch has no

more legislative authority than the Senate. The reasons for this dis-
tinction are noticed in treating of the house-powers.

2. — CUTIVE.

§ 4. In reference to the treaty-making power, particularly as to
where it should be vested, there were three classes of views ad-
vanced in the Convention. I

The first proposition was to place it exclusively in the Senate.

The second, exclusively in the President.

The third (and this prevailed), to vest it in the hands of the
President and Senate. C

Pm 11.] ' imam SENATE.’ “ s o A   143

§ 5. l/Vhen it was ﬁnally settled to place this prerogative in the

hands of the ‘ President and Senate, a new question arose, on-

which there was considerable difference of opinion : Shall it require
a bare numerical majority of the senators present to ratify a treaty

. when proposed by the President ‘? ' or shall it require a two-third ma-

jority? At length, the plan was adopted requiring a two-third
majority. S A ”
§ 6. There was then a ‘proposition made to modify the treaty-

Vrnalzing power with regard to treaties of peace. On this subject

there werefour parties. j ‘ '

One was for giving the whole power over treaties of peace into
the hands of the President. j

A second was for vesting it in the Senate, but requiring a two-
third majority, - «

A third, for vesting it in the Senate, requiring only a numerical
majority. V

A fourth was for placing it withthe President and the Senate,

requiring a two-third senatorial majority as in all other cases.

This last view was adopted. The ratiﬁcation of any and all

treaties proposed by the Executive requires the votes of two-thirds
of all the senators present.

. §-7. A treaty is an agreement or contract between two or more
nations, -entered into with proper formality and solemnity, deﬁning.

the rights of the respective parties thereto with regard to trade,
commerce, boundaries, or with reference to the protection of their
mutual interests against invasion from other powers.

§ 8. The terms of treaties are usually agreed upon either by com-.
missioners" appointed by their respective governments for the speciﬁc

A purpose of arranging the details, or by ambassadors or other public

ministers.
§ 9.‘ Treaties are discussed by the Senate in secret session. They

- can ratify or reject a treaty, or ratify it in part and reject it in part; or

they can make additions to it. Every part of a treaty, to be valid,
must be ratiﬁed by a vote of two-thirds of the senators present.

.When amendments to or alterations of the treaties have been made
by the Senate, the whole document must. be re-submitted to the

144 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

President, and also to the foreign govermnent with whom negotiations
are pending.

§10. The President must submit the nominations of certain.

classes of ofﬁcers to the Senate for their advice and consent. The
Senate may conﬁrm or reject a nomination made by the President;
though it is usual, in deference to the Executive, to conﬁrm, unless
there is a palpable unﬁtness in the nomination. The Senate’s advice
and consent are to be asked, on the nomination, by the President, of
ambassadors, other public ministers anCl0011Sl11S» judges Of the S11p1‘0m<3
Court, and all other officers of the United States whose appointments
are not otherwise provided for in the Constitution, and which shall
be established by law. .

§ 11. It will be seen, by reference to the powers of Congress,
that the appointment of such inferior ofﬁcers as they shall think
proper may be vested in the President alone, in the courts of law,
or in the heads of departments. A

§ 12. On the subject of appointments, especially of the judges
of the Supreme Court, members of the Constitutional Convention
were dividedin opinion.

One class of opinions was in favor of giving ‘the appointments to
the Executive alone. A

A second preferred that they should be vested in the Senate
alone. A '

A third proposed that the nomination should be made by the
Senate, allowing the President a negative, but giving the Senate
the power to overrule his negative by a two-third majority.

’ A fourth was (and this prevailed), to give the nomination to the
President, and the power of conﬁrmation or rejection by a majority
to the Senate ; and ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls,
were included with the judges of the Supreme Court.

. 3.-—-ELECTIVE. V

§ 13. The Senate has the power to elect its officers, except the
president thereof, who holds this position by virtue of his being Vice-
President of the United States. They are required by the Consti-
tution to choose  president pro zfempore also. Deliberative bodies,

to their independence. Here is one of the exceptions to the general
rule, however, that the Vice-President is, ex oﬁicio, President of the-

§ 14. Besides the president pro tempore, the Senate officers are
a secretary, who keeps the record or journal, has charge of the
papers, and reads such as he may be called upon by the members to
read ; a sergeant-at-arms, who sees that orders of the Senate are exe-

cuted; a postmaster, who sees to the mailing and distributing let—.
» ters and papers for the members‘; and _a door-keeper, who has charge

of the doors.- ;
§ 15. These officers, except the president pr0.tempo9‘e, are not

speciﬁed in the Constitution, and are not elected from among the

members of the Senate- ' 4

§ 16. As a last resort, the Senate electsa Vice—President of the
United States. This is not done, however, until an attempt toelect
this officer on the part of electors chosen by the people has resulted

. in ‘a failure. An election of a Vice-President by the Senate has

taken place in the history of our government but once: ‘in 1837,

-Richard M. ohnson was elected by the Senate.

. - _ _. - ‘4.-«JU~DIoIA’L.s . .

§ 17. The Constitution vests in the Senate the sole power to try
all impeachments. To this provision there was very earnest opposi-
tion in the Constitutional Convention. Three different classes of
views were maintained on this subject: —
c‘ ' 1st. That, as a trial of impeachment is a judicial proceeding, it
ought to be com'mitted"to the Supreme Court, or some other tribunal
learned in’ the ‘law. _ ‘ ’ E 1' ' ‘ '

2d. Others maintained that it was not wholly’ judicial ; andtherefore
they preferred to have it submitted to the Supreme Court, united
with some other tribunal for that purpose appointed. 1
~  3d. ’ Still others (and for this proposition there was ‘a majority). in-

sisted that thetrial of impeachment should be vested exclusively in‘
- the Senate. ‘ ‘ t

CHAPTER I.

EARLY SETTLEMENT OF AMERICAJ

§1. THE N ORTH-A.MERICAN CoLoNIEs, over which the British
Government maintained supremacy for more than a hundred years,
were known as New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.
Ever since the Declaration of Independence, they have been called
States. -
§2. They were settled chieﬂy by British subjects, except New
York and Delaware; the former by emigrants from Holland, and
the latter from Holland and Switzerland. .
§3. The British claim to jurisdiction over these Colonies was
founded on what Christian nations recognized as the right of dis-
covery. Great Britain denied from the beginning the right of the
Dutch to make settlements in America. That denial was based on
the fact that John Cabot and his son Sebastian, British subjects,
under commission from Henry the Seventh,_ sailed along the eastern
coast of North America in 1497. The Cabots, however, made no
attempt at settlement or conquest.
’“§ 4. At the time of its settlement, Delaware was an appendage
11

146 ANALYSIS on CIVIL. GOVERNMENT. [PART II.i

from their decision there is no appeal. They organize anevv, and
take a special oath or afﬁrmation ‘applicable to the proceeding. ’ 4

'§ 19. When the President of the United States is tried, the
Chief Justice shall preside. This clause was not debated in the Con-'
vention that formed the * Constitution ; and therefore the precise rea-
sons for its insertion are not apparent. It has been suggested by
able Write1‘s, that the Vice—President should not preside on such an
occasion, because he has adirect interest in the President’s convic- '
tion. ' It has also been‘ maintained bya very learned senator, tlmt,
when the President shall be on trial for impeachment, he should be
suspended from office for the time being, and until the result shall be
declared ; and that this state of things Would bring the Vice-Presi-
dent to the presidential chair. Insuch case, he could not preside
over the trial of the President. _ '

§20. Perhaps one or even both of the foregoing reasons may ’
have inﬂuenced the authors of the Constitution to make this pro-
vision. There is still another reason that may have had something
toido with its origin. The President’ of the United States _is the
highest officer underour " government ; and it may have been thought
in the highest degree proper and beﬁtting, that,'if brought to trial on
impeachment, the highest judicial 1 officer should preside over the
solemndeliberations of such an august proceeding. ’

’§ 21. It requires a majority of two-thirds of the members present
to convict a party on impeachment. This was believed to be neces-
sary in order to guard against hasty and inconsiderate decisions, and
to prevent convictions from party zeal and political bias and -pre--
judice. , So large a majority, moreover, would be more likely to
command the respect and peaceable acquiescence of the whole
country. ' - V I . _ ‘- ‘

§ 22. The:Constitution limits the punishment to be‘ inﬂicted by
thesenate on impeachment,———- ‘ ' . — »

1st. To removal from office ; and, ,

2d. Toidisqualiﬁcation to hold and enjoy any olﬁce of honor,
trust, or proﬁt under the United States. But We shallisee in another
chapter, that the party convicted ca.n not plead his conviction by the
senate in bar to further trial, condemnation, and punishment by
the courts of law.

PART II.] THE SENATE. 147.

§ 23. As we have seen, the impeachment is preferred by the
House of Representatives, and is in the nature of an indictment, spe-
ciﬁcally charging the accused with the commission of certain crimes
or misdemeanors in ofﬁce. The articles of impeachment are brought
to the notice of the Senate by a committee appointed for that pur-
pose by the House of Representatives. .

§'24. The Senate issues a summons, citing the party accused to
appear before them on a day and hour therein speciﬁed ; which sum-
mons is served on the party accused by the sergeant-at-armsgof the
Senate. i

§ 25. When the accused appears at the bar of the Senate, either
in person or by counsel, in obedience to the summons, he is informed
of the impeachment brought against him by the House, a copy of the
charges are given to him, and he is allowed time to prepare his an-
swer. ‘

§ 26. ‘When he has answered to the charges speciﬁed in the im-
peachment, the House replies to the answer through its committee,
and asserts its readiness to prove them. "Time is given the accused

. to prepare-for trial, and he is allowed to have the assistance of coun-

sel. The trial proceeds substantially according to‘ the usual forms
and method observed" in the higher courts of law. .

§ 27. When the evidence in the case and the arguments are con-
cluded, each senator, on the call of his name, and on each article of
the impeachment, votes 3/ea.or nay on the guilt of the accused. If
two-thirds of all t-hesenators present ﬁnd him guilty of any or all of
the charges speciﬁed, sentence is pronounced accordingly.

§ 28. In pronouncing sentence, the ﬁrst question put to each
senator, on answering to his name, is, “ Shall the accused be removed
from the oﬁice which he holds ? ” On this question, each senator
answers yea or, nay. ‘ ’

The second question is, “Shall the accused be disqualiﬁed to
hold and enjoy any oﬁice of honor, trust, or proﬁt under the United
States?” On this question, each senator answers yea or nay ; and
judgment is rendered accordingly, and can extend no further.

PROVISIONS COMMON TO BOTH HOUSES.

ARTICLE I.—MEMBERSHIP.

,Each house shall be thejuelge of the elections, returns, and
qua-l@‘lcatz'ons of its own members. E7. 4

§ 1. These are powers, which, from the necessity of the case,
must be vested in the house where membership is claimed. It is
necessary to settle the legality and regularity of the election ; other-
wise any person might intrude himself into either house without the
least show of authority. Regularity and legality of election can be
determined only by an inquiry into the election through the returns,
which opens the whole subject for investigation ; for, -in ascertain-
ing the Validity of the returns, it may be necessary to go back of
them, and inquire into the legality of the election itself.

§ 2. It is quite possible that a person might be legally and reg-
ularly elected, and yet be wholly‘ disqualiﬁed for a seat in either
house. His moral character might be such as to bring a reproach
upon the house of which he should become a member. He might
be known for treachery and disloyalty to the government, and for
the most persistent efforts to betray its trusts and to sacriﬁce its
interests. Or he might lack any or all those qualiﬁcations which
the Constitution requires to render a person eligible to the member-
ship in question.

§ 3. The power of determining the right to membership belongs
not only to each house of Congress by express constitutional pro-
vision, but like authority is conceded to the legislative bodies of all
the States, and ‘to kindred bodies under all free governments.

ART. II. — QUORUM.

1. A majority of either house is a quorum to do business.

2. A smaller number may acljourn from clay to clay.

3. A smaller number may be authortzecl to compel the at-
tenclance of absent members in such manner and under
such penalties as each house may promlole. 1'7.

PART IL] COMMON TO BOTH HOUSES. 149

§ 1. It is indispensable that the Constitution specify the number
necessary to do business ; otherwise a reckless and intriguing minori-
ty might take advantage of the absence of the majority, and usurp

the functions of legislation by enacting repugnant and odious laws,

or by repealing those ‘most acceptable to the people.

§ 2. On the contrary, if a smaller number could not adjourn
from day to day, or compel the attendance of absent members, the
whole business of legislation might be suspended at the pleasure of
a few refractory absentees. The necessityiof these three provisions
in reference to business, therefore, must be evident at a glance.

ART. III.—JOURNAL. -

1. Each house shall keep a journal of its p7~oceeclz'n,(/3.
2. They shall 1’O’tl(7)l?:8]2. the same from time to time, except such
parts as in theirjuclgment shall reg/m.'9°e secrecy. E9.

§ 1. These provisions impose a salutary restraint upon the mem-
bers of the two‘ houses. In a certain sense, they bring representative
and constituent face to face. VVhat ‘is done to-day in the legislative
halls of the nation is transferred to-morrow to the columns of the

press, and carried abroad in the mail-bags all over the land. We

know to-morrow What our senator or representative has done to-day.
Legislators are thus compelled to act under a high sense of their
political responsibility. 4

§ 2. But there are proceedings, or may be, in every legislative
body, especially in times of insurrection or invasion, the immediate
publication of which would be imprudent in the highest degree.
The publication of such from day to day might give great advan-
tage to a formidable enemy, and endanger the very existence of the
government itself. Each house is therefore allowed to judge of the
propriety and prudence of such publications. A

§ 3. The object of publication is twofold : -

First, For future convenience ; as it may be necessary to refer to
the record, from time to time, in the transaction of business which
may be more or less connected with what has gone before.

Second, It acts as a salutary check to hasty legislation, as each
member knows that he is making a ‘record to be read by coming
generations. ’ T T T

150   ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

ART. 1v.—YEAs AND NAYS.
At the clestre of 0ne;ﬂfth of those present, the 3/6668 and

nays of the members of either house shall be entered on the

joumal on may question. E9.

§1. The usual method of‘ taking a vote in deliberative bodies is
substantially this: The question being stated by the , presiding offi-
cer, he puts it ﬁrst afﬁrmatively, “ As many as are in favor of the
proposition, say Age.” All the members in favor of the move re-
spond Age. The presiding oﬁﬁcer then puts the question negatively,
“Those opposed, say No.” The president is generally able to de#
cide by the sound; but, if not, he repeats the trial, calling the vote
both affirmatively and negatively. If still in doubt, or at the
request of a member, the house may be divided; the affirmative
taking’ one side, and the negative the other, when the sec_retary
counts: and, on the count, the decision is made. ‘

§ 2. But, in taking the yeas and nays, the process is quite dif-
ferent. The presiding officer states both sides at once, thus : “ As
many as are in favor, &c., will, when their names are called, an.-
swer Yea ,' and as manyas are opposed will, when their names are
called, answer No.” The names are then called,usually in alpha-
betical order, each member rising at the call of his name by the
secretary or clerk, and answering yea or nay, as he votes ; - the clerk
noting the vote in each case. He then usually reads over the list
of names and the votes in each case, so that, if any mistakes have
been made, they may be corrected. _

§ 3. The object of this process of voting is, that a definite and
enduring record may ‘be made of the transaction, both for the
information of the people and for future reference. The record also
shows who were absent; a matter of scarcely less importance to the
member, or his constituency, than the vote itself one way or the
other. Members sometimes absent themselves for the purpose of
avoiding responsibility in voting. ‘ 1

§ 4. The Constitution places it within the power of one-ﬁfth the
members present to compel the calling of the yeas and nays. It is
a power that may be shamefully abused, however, by a refractory
minority calling for the yeas and nays on any and every frivolous

PART IL] COMMON TO BOTH ‘HOUSES. - 151

pretense, for the purpose of defeating decisive legislation on meas.

tires which they cannot prevent on direct vote. It consumes con~ ’

siderable time to take the yeas and nays in an assembly constituted
of a hundred and ﬁfty or two hundred 1nernbe_rs_; and hours are
sometimes wasted in this way“ on unimportant motions, so as to
compel the majority to-an adjournment from sheer exhaustion.

, ART. V.—BUS,IN.ES'S RULES. , .

Each house may determine the rules of its own proceed-
vings. E§. , , .

-§ 1. Every deliberative assembly has an inherent right to adopt
such rules as .it chooses for*the_t_r_ansaction of business, provided
those rules do. not violate any organic law from which such assembly
receives its authority. It is but in aﬁirmance of this right that the
Constitution contains the foregoing clause. - ‘ ,

,,§ 2. Take away the right to adopt their own rules of proceeding,
and it would be utterly impracticable to transact business with
facility and dispatch. Of course, the rules of business must be in
conformity with the provisions of the Constitution. Neither house,
for instance, could enforce a rule, should they make one,_ requiring
more than one-ﬁfth of the members present to secure the call of the
yeas and nays.

ART. Vi. — PENALTIES.

1. Either house may punish its members for disorderly
p conduct ; and, 
2. W756]; the concurrence of two-zfhvlrds, eccjoel ct member. E§.

V § 1. The power to punish members for disorderly. conduct is usu-
ally given to legislative bodies. Witliout this power, it might be
impossible, at times, to transact business. Under high excitement,
‘members are sometimes boisterous ' and tumultuous in conduct;
and they might persist in disturbing the assembly, but for this power

to punish. V Rules would be of no use without the power to enforce

them. .

§ 2. The power to expel a member is given for the same pur-

pose ; that is, for the preservation of order, andifor the maintenance

152 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

of proper decorum.‘ Without these, the country would lose all
_respect for its legislative assembly. But lest party—spirit might
overstep the limits of propriety, and a domineering majority expel

-members of opposite political sentiments from improper motives, a

salutary restraint is imposed, requiring‘ a vote of two-thirds for the
expulsion of a member. So large a majority it would be difficult to
secure in any case ‘Where the rights of the assembly had not been
grossly outraged.
‘ l ART. VII.—PROHIBITIONS.
1.. ADJOURNMENTS. .
1st. ZVeither house, cluring the session of Oongress,
shall, without the consent of the other, acljourn
for more than three clays ; nor,

2d’. To any other place than that in which the two

_ houses shall be sitting. %€B. .
2. ON MEMBERS. .

No member of either house shall, during the time for
which he was elected, be ctppoiazted to any oﬁice under
the United States,

1 1st. W’/tich shall have been createcl cluring such time ; nor,
2d; The emoluments of which have been increased dur-
ing such time. 9%.  

§ 1. — ADJOURNMENTS.

1st. As to Time. -——If there were no limitation as to the time for
which either house, during the session of Congress, might adjourn
without the consent of the other, a factions party-spirit controlling
in either house might seriously interrupt legislation, or bring it to
an untimely close. ‘ i

2d. As to Place.—--VVere there no restriction with regard to the
place to which either house might adjourn without the consent of
the other, mischief equally disastrous. and embarrassing‘ might be
perpetrated. One house might compel the other to follow it from
place to place for the very purpose of’ preventing legislation. This
might be done by a minority taking advantage of the absence of a

” majority, asa minority has power to adjourn.

PART II.] COMMON TO BOTH HOUSES. 153

The duration of the sessions of Congress depends,

1st. On the Constitutional limitation, which can not extend be-
yond the period of two‘ years. _

2d. On the pleasure of he two houses, subject to the foregoing
restriction. . V

3d. On the pleasure of the President of the United States,
when the two hguses can not agree on the time of adjournment.

§ 2.——ON MEMBERS.

1st. If a member of Congress were permitted to assist in creat-
ing an office, and then to resign his seat for the purpose of obtain-
ing that office on being nominated to it by the President, it would
throw wide open theidoors to executive corruption. .Numerous lu-
crative oﬁices might thus be created by legislation, with the under-
standing, express or implied, between the legislators and the
Executive, that the offices so created should be distributed among

"those who were instrumental in creating them. A A
v . The chairman of "the Judiciary Committee might propose to the

house of which he was a member the creation of a United-States

. judgeshipin California, with a salary of ten thousand dollars a year ;

and, through his official influence, the bill might pass both houses of
Congress. By pre-arrangement with the Executive, that office might
be secured to the very man who had been the chief means of creat-
ing it, were he at liberty to resign his seat and take it.

2d. Also, by a system of “ bargaining and selling,” the salaries

of certain‘ oﬂices might be greatly increased by mercenary legisla- ‘

tion ; and then those salaries might be bestowed on the very men who

had been active in augmenting them, but for the restriction under-

consideration.

We can not too much admire the wisdom, purity, and sagacity of
the great and good men who formed the Constitution, in their efforts
to withdraw as far as possible from the framework of our govern-
ment all motives to selﬁsh and dishonest legislation.

ART. VIII.—OFFICIAL OATH.

. Senators and 7~epresentatz'ves shall be bound by oath or aft?‘-
matton to support the Oonstttution of the Umited States. 81.

154 ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART 1];

§ 1. This oath is administered to -themembers, before taking their
seats, by the Secretary of the Senate, or Clerk of the House of Repre-
sentatives. The one who takes it appeals to the Supreme Being
for the rectitude of his intentions. Such an oath is calculated to
make a solemn impression on the mind of any candid and consci-
entious man. . _

§ 2. It seems ﬁt and proper, therefore, that all who assume the
important trust of legislation for their country should take upon
themselves this solemn obligation. They assume grave responsibili-
ties, the faithfuldischarge of which concerns the welfare of the whole
people. . e ‘ .

§ 3. If it is necessary to administer a solemn oath to a justice of
the peace, a witness, a juror, or constable, to insure the faithful
performance of his duties, it is far more beﬁtting in cases of the
most sacred public trust.

§ 4. Some persons are conscientiously opposed to taking an oath

on any occasion whatever. Out of respect to the scruples of such _

persons, a solemn afﬁrmation is administered instead of an oath.

ART. IX. —»SALARIES.i

. 1. The members shall receive ct compenscmlon for their ser-

vices, to be ctseertavlnecl by law ,' cmd,
2. The same shall be paid out of the treasury of the United
States. QB. .

§ 1. In the Constitutional Convention, there were quite a number
of members _opposed to allowing salaries to representatives and sena-
tors, but more especially senators. It was proposed to consider the
honor of the position a suﬁicient reward; believing that this would
secure the services of men of higher character and more distinguished
ability. On the contrary, it was urged that this would savor too
much of aristocracy, and prevent men of limited means, however
worthy, from accepting seats in the national councils, and thus de-
prive the country of the beneﬁts, in many -instances, of able minds,
for want of wealth. -

§ 2. In England, the members of Parliament are not paid for
their services. If a poor man is elected to the House of Commons,

PART 11.] e , COMMON TO BOTH HOUSES. . 155

he iscompelled to depend on the liberality of wealthy friends. The
House of‘ Lords is composed of . the aristocracy of the realm, who, of
course, stand‘ in no need of salaries. , '

§ 3. But the majority. of the Convention were in favor of salaries ;
and this View prevailed. It was thought best that the salaries
of members should be paid from the United-States treasury, as that
would be more likely to secure promptness-of payment, and, conse-
quently, promptness of attendance. Under the Confederation, the
members were paid by their respective States. The pay was often
slow, and the attendance tardy and reluctant. -

§ 4. The salaries of members is to be ascertained (that is, ﬁxed)
by law.’ ’Bu_t who makesthe law‘? The members ‘themselves.
The salaries have been advanced several times since 1789, atthe
opening of the ﬁrst Congress under the present Constitution. '

1st. From March 4, 17.89, to March 4, 1795, inclusive, six dollars

a day. 4 For the same time, six dollars for every twenty miles’
travel. I '
2d. From March 4, 1795, to March 4, 1796, inclusive, senators
- received seven dollars, and representatives six dollars, a day,

. and travel-fe,€S. as before. '

ea. From March 4, 1796,"te Dec. 5,1815, the pay of members
i of eitherhouse was six dollars a day‘, and travel-allowance six
dollars for every twenty miles.

4th. From. Dec.i5, 1815, to March 4, 1817, the pay was fifteen

hundred dollars a year, travel~fees as before, and proportional ~

deduction of salary for absence for any cause but sickness.
The President‘ of the Senate and the Speaker of the House
received double the pay of other members. 4

5th. From March 4, 1817, to the ﬁrst Monday of December, 1856,
the pay was eight dollars a day, and eight dollars for every
twenty miles’ travel. The President pro . tempore of the
Senate and the Speaker of the House each received double the
pay of other members.

to the government of New York; but it was afterwards separated
from that Colony, and came under the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania.

.New York was early wrested from the Dutch by conquest, and

brought under British authority. .

§_5. - The only title which the nations of Europe had to any part
of the American continent was -founded on what they called the
right of discovery. It is difficult to comprehend the justice of this
pretense, when it is known that thecountry was already occupied
by a race of men who had been in undisputed possession for untold
ages. As between themselves, it might not be unjust or improper
that the European nations should make discovery the foundation of
title; but, as against the natives of the soil, discovery could not
furnish the shadow of a claim.

§ 6. The right of discovery set up by the Europeans, substantially
ignores the sacred rights of the original inhabitants of this country.
Nativity must furnish a more valid title than discovery; and there
is not a people on earth that would require any argument to con-
Vince them of this where their own rights were involved. Demon-
strations of power are not always demonstrations of right.

§7. The Indians have always been treated as merely lawful occu-

pants, having at most only a qualiﬁed right to the soil. The pow-
erful natio_ns of Europe, and our own government, have recognized

them only as tenants-at-will, subject to removal at the pleasure of

superior power. p

. § 8. The learned Judge Story remarks in regard to thewrongs per-
petrated on the red man, “They have not been permitted, indeed,
to alienate their possessory right to the soil, except to the nations

to whom they were thus bound by a qualiﬁed dependence : but, in‘

other respects, they have been left to the free exercise of internal
sovereignty in regard to the members of their own tribe, and in
regard to the intercourse with other tribes; and their title to the soil,
by way of occupancy, has -been generally respected, until it has
been extinguished by purchase, or by conquest, under the authority
of the nation upon which they were dependent.

§9. “A large portion of the territory in the United States to

‘which the Indian title is now extinguished has been acquired by

What the salaries may be at the next advance depends on the
pleasure of Congress.

CHAPTER IV.
POWERS or CONGRESS.

No'.rE.’— 1. While it is intended to treat the departments of government
by topics, it will be necessary to frequently refer to other subjects than the
one under more immediate consideration. The powers conferred by the
Constitution are intimately related to and dependent on each other. The
legislative functions are so related to the executive and judicial, the judicial
to the executive and legislative, and the executive to each of the others,
that, in treating of either, reference must be had more or less to the others.

_ 2. It is desirable, however (and that is the aim of this worklj‘, to group
powers of kindred character, as far as possible, under the same general or
speciﬁc titles. The arrangement of the powers speciﬁed in the Constitu-
tion is palpably defective, as has been noticed by our best writers on the
subject. In discussing‘ it, therefore, by topics, it is impossible to pay much
attention to the order of that arrangement.

3. This want of order in the instrument is more particularly apparent,
perhaps, in the powers of Congress, than in either of the other departments
of the government. Single sentences and clauses are scattered here and
there, detached from their proper connections, without any regard to their
harmonious and necessary relationship. It is the purpose of the Analysis,

-as far as possible, to bring these fragmentary clauses and sentences into

position with others to which they are related.

1. -- RESOURCES.

§ 1. A tax is a sum of money levied on the property or inhabitants
of a country for the support of the government. VVhen levied on
individuals, Without any reference to the amount of property owned
by them, it is called a capitation or poll tax. When levied on the

' property, it is to be done in proportion to its value, as ascertained

by local officers called assessors.
§ 2. The power to lay and collect taxes belongs to every human
government, Without which the expenses thereof could not be de-

‘frayed. This is one of the means which it has of enabling it to

perform its obligations to the country. No government could sus-
tain itself Without regular and reliable resources.

§ 3. The word “taxes ” here, doubtless, means direct taxes, which
are mentioned in two other places in the Constitution, and which are to

‘ be imposed on States according to their respective numbers, as ascer_-

tained by the census, or enumeration. Theyare to be apportioned
among the several States in the same manner as representatives.

§ 4 Taxes are of two kinds, ——direct and indirect. Direct taxes
are such as may be levied on land and other real estate, and capi-
t-ation-taxes, or taxes on individuals. Indirect taxes are such as are

158 ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PARTII..

levied on articles of - consumption, of which no person pays, except
in proportion to the quantity or number of such articles which he
may consume. A A

§ 5. Duties, imposts, and excises are also of the nature of indi-

' rect taxes. These must be uniform throughout the Uhited. States.

This is to prevent giving a.ny preference to the pursuits or interests
of one State over those of another. , ,

" § 6. The word “ duties” refers to a kind oft-axes levied on goods
and merchandise imported or exported. In our country, an export
duty is not permitted to be levied. The Constitution forbids it.
The word “ imposts,” under our government, is-equivalent to “ cus-
toms,’_’ referring strictly to the duties on imports from foreign coun-
tries. It would also cover duties on exports, _were such duties
allowable. ' V ’ D A

§ 7. The word “ excises ” is applied more particularly to internal

taxation ; being levied on articles manufactured and consumed in the
country, and also on various kinds of business. The money paid
for licenses to sell liquors, or to deal in any other commodities, is
called excises, or excise taxes. _ , i . ‘

, §8. Duties on imports are of two kinds,——speciﬁc and ad
valorem. A speciﬁc dutyis a certain sum of money charged by
law at the custom-house where goods are ‘landed, according to quan-

tity or weight, without any reference to the value of the articles A

weighed or measured ; as a dollar on a yard of silk,-a gallon of brandy,
a bushel of wheat, or a poundof opium.

§ 9. “ Ad valorem ” is a word or phrase that signiﬁes‘ according
to £726 value‘ of. Ad valorem duties are levied on articles accord-_
ing to their value. An ad valorem duty of twenty per cent on
a watch or diamond worth a hundred dollars would require the pay-
ment of twenty dollars. _ V _

§ 10. Duties are collected at the custom-house where the dutiablc

D goods are landed. It is not easyto avoid the payment of speciﬁc

duties, except by a process called smug;/Zz'7zg,' that is, by the owner’s
concealing the articles, or landing them clandestinely, in order to
avoid payment. In such case, however, he runs the risk of detec-

PART II.] POWERS or corrcnnss».  159

tion, and "forfeiture of the goods to the government, and of subject-
ing himself to other penalties more or less severe. I

§ 11. In the payment of ad valorem duties, there is considerable‘

chanceifor the perpetration of fraud. The owner of the goods is
required to swear to the accuracy and truthfulness of his invoices ;
that is, the bills of goods. _ The goods are e_stimated at their value
where they are purchased, not where delivered.

A dishonest merchant might produce a false invoice, rating the
goods below their cost value, so as to bring the duties to a lower
standard. For instance, if he imported a thousand reams of paper,
costing him four dollars a ream, he might producepto the custom-
house officer a false invoice or bill, rating the paper at two dollars a
ream. If the ad valorem duty were twenty per cent, and the im-
porter Should succeed in his fraud, he would clear four hundred
dollars.  I I ‘ I .

§'1‘2.. But the custom-house oﬁ‘i'cer is not bound by the invoice,
nor by «the ‘oath of the owner. I If he believes there is a mistake, he
has the goods appraised, and exacts duties» according to their ascer-
tained value. If fraud is proved, the goods are forfeited to the use
of the United States; and the perpetrator of the iniquity may be
ﬁned or imprisoned, or both. ' ~ ‘ - ‘ ‘

§’13., The power to borrow money on the credit of the United
States is classed among the government resources. It has often
been found to be of great importance in sustaining the ﬁnancial in-
terests of the country. ’ No countryrcan sustain itself through a
long and expensive war, simply on its ordinary income. All the
great powers of the world have found it necessary, at one time or
another, to borrow money. r - . . _
§ 14. In our Wars with Great Britain and with Mexico, we found
it necessary to borrow in large sums ; but, in our more recent do-
mestic war, we were compelled -to run up our national debt to nearly
three thousand millions In time of war, it is sometimes necessary,
in a few years, to anticipate the government income for a quarter or
half a century. - a

§ 17. The right of ownership always implies the right of aliena-
tion. The right to dispose of the territory of the United States
is to be understood here in a restricted sense. Congress has not the

power to dispose of a State, for instance, by alienation. The United

States does not own a State in fee-simple, or in any sense implying
an interest in its soil. Congress has the power to dispose of,

1st, Unorganized and unoccupied tracts or territories.

2d, Public lands in parcels to settlers, or to individuals desiring
‘to purchase.

3d, To dispose of them in any other way for the promotion of the
general welfare.

4th, To cede to States unoccupied lands lying within their boun-1

daries, for literary or school purposes. 6

5th, To re-cede to States, for instance, from which they have been
obtained, any. lands, when the purposes for which they were ob-
tained no longer exist.

§ 18. This power to dispose of the territory of the United States
implies the power to sell the lands, or to give them away for the

PART IL] ‘POWERS on CONGRESS. 161

public good. Many of the Weste1'n States have received grants of’
large tracts of lands within their borders by act of Congress. In
selling lands to individual purchasers, the government has received
many millions into its treasury : so that the disposition of the terri-
tory of the United States may properly be regarded as one of the
national resources. , e V -

§ 19. In 1780, Congress resolved that lands that might be relin-
quished to the United States by any particular State or States
should be disposed of for the common beneﬁt‘ of the United States,
and be settled and formed into distinct republican States, to become
members of the Union, and have the same rights of sovereignty as
other States. This was the ﬁrst step taken which has resulted in
the acquisition of immense territory subject to the disposal of Con-
gress. . ' , ,

§ 20. _Before being oliered for sale, the ‘lands are regularly sur-
veyed into townships six miles square, andthe townships into divis-
ions called sections of six hundred and forty acres each (one mile

_ square); and the sections are surveyed into half, quarter, and eighths

of sections. The townships are numbered north and south, and
ranges numbered east and west; as, for instance, township number
nine, north or south, range six, east or west. Here is a map of a
township marked off in sections, one of which is marked into subdi.-.
Visions, each containing but forty acres : -

ship has been granted to the State for common-school purposes. In

.Michigan, and perhaps in the other States, section sixteen is the one
selected, locating the school~lands very near the centre of the
township. ‘ 1 ‘

§ 22. For many years, the lands, after being surveyed, were>‘sub-
j.ect to sale bynauction, after which any that remained unsold were sub-
ject to purchase a.t private sale; the price in either case, a dollarandfa
quarter an ‘acre. T But in 1854 there was a change in the terms : any
that were unsold after being in market ten years or upwards were held
for actual settlers at a dollar an acre. . Unsold lands,‘ after being in
market ﬁfteen years or upwards, to actual settlers, seventyeﬁve cents
per acre ; twenty years or upwards, ﬁfty cents per acre; twenty-ﬁve
years or upwards, twenty—ﬁve cents_ per acre; thirty years or up-
Wards, twelve and one-half cents per acre, Under this act, however,
no settler was allowed to" purchase more than three hundred and
twenty acres, or half a section. _ ' . _ g ' 

§23. _May 20, 1862, Congress passed an act, whichwas amended
March 21, 1864, and rnn.1{ei~ amended June 21, 1866, known as
the Homestead Law. This law allows actual settlers, under certain
restrictions, to obtain one hundred and sixty acres of land, — enough
for a home, ——for the triﬂing sum of ﬁve dollars. The chief‘ restric-
tions are, —— - - - .
1st. The applicant shall make affidavit that he or sheis the head

any other person or personswhomsoever.

pancy. V " r _ v _ ’
§ 24. The foregoing synopsis will give a fair idea of the object

PART '11.]. POWERS on oonennss.   163

and intention of the law. The whole drift and scope of the act are,
to encourage actual settlers to enter and cultivate the Western coun-
try. ‘The theory of the advocates of this law is, that it is far bet-
ter for the country, and more proﬁtable to the government‘ as a
source of revenue, that these lands should be given away to millions
of actual settlers and cultivators of the.soil, than that they should
be sold to speculators at Whatever price, to remain ‘untouched by
the hand of industry, and unproductive for an indeﬁnite future.

.fActual settlement will add immensely to the taxable property of the
country.

§ 25. During the ﬁscal year ending June 30, 1866, public lands

were disposed of as follows :—

4,629,312.87

During the same period 6,423,984.18 acres were offered for sale.
The cash receipts from sales and other sources were $824,645.08.
The number of homestead ‘entries exceeded that of the preceding
year by more than sixty per cent. .

The entire amount of the public domain at that time was one
thousand four hundred sixty-ﬁve millions, four hundred sixty-eight
thousand, eight hundred acres (1,465,468,800). Of this vast do-
main, four hundred seventy-four millions, one hundred sixty thou-
sand, ﬁve hundred ﬁfty-one acreshad been surveyed (474,160,551).

§ 26. Congress is invested with power to dispose of other prop-
erty of the United States. This, doubtless, includes every species
of personal property. In time of War, especially, a vast amount
of personal, property accumulates in the hands of government, such as
ships, horses, Wagons, guns, clothing for soldiers, &c., which become

. useless in time of ‘peace, and may be disposed of to the advantage
of the public treasury.

164 ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

2.--DISBURSEMENTS.
1.—— To pay the Debts.

§27. In the opinion of the most distinguished jurist who has writ-
ten on the Constitution, Judge Story, the o_nly purposes for which
the burden of taxes, duties, imposts, and excises can be imposed, are
to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general
welfare of the United States. The power of raising money through
these means is for these deﬁnite and stipulated purposes.

§28. Another eminent writer on the subject holds that the power
over these governmental resources is unlimited and absolute, with-
out any reference to the objects for which they are to be disbursed.
By this reasoning, he would be obliged to vary the punctuation of
these clauses so as to wholly disconnect that of obtaining money

‘ from that of paying it out. To justify this interpretation, it should

read thus : --
lst. Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im-
posts, and excises. C ‘

2d. They shall have power to pay the debts and_ provide for the

common defense and general welfare of the United States.
By reference to the original manuscript copy now preserved in the

‘ archives of the government at VVashington, a true copy of which is

found in this work, it will be seen that the punctuation of these
clauses will not bear any such construction. The true construction
seems to be, that Congress has these revenue powers in order to pay
the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare
of the United States ; that is, they are given for these express
purposes, and no other.

§29. Every thing necessary for the welfare of the country is in-
cluded in these» powers of collecting money and disbursing it. 'We
have seen that it may be necessary to borrow money ; thus creating
a public debt for the payment of which the public faith must be
pledged. But public credit would be worthless, were there no au-
thority to pay the debts thus contracted. This, it will be remem-
bered, was a serious defect under the Confederation. The govern-
ment was utterly powerless to maintain its credit at home or abroad.

§30. The Great Rebellion of 1861-65 would have been successful

but for the public credit which enabled our government to anticipate

its revenue for one or two generations. We have seen that its ex-‘

penditures were more than two millions a day for four consecutive
years. Nothing but the strong powers of the government over its
ﬁnances enabled it to march triumphantly through that terrible trial.

§31. The national debts before the Rebellion sometimes looked for-
midable ; but, from our present standpoint, they appear insigniﬁcant.
In 1791, just after emerging from the Revolutionary VVar, it was less
than eighty millions. In 1805, it Was less than ninety millions.

,VVith all the expenses of the War of 1812 with Great Britain, it

amounted, in 1816, to less than a hundred and thirty millions.

2.8-— The Common Defense. '

' §32. To provide for the common defense is one of the objects for
which the various kinds of taxes may be imposed. . Herein, as We
have already seen, the Confederation Was sadly deﬁcient. It could
apportion to the several States their respective shares of men‘ and
money to be raised,‘ but could not enforce the enlistment or drafting

of a single soldier, or the raising of a dollar in money.
§33.* A nation without the ability to ‘protect itself from foreign
invasion or domestic insurrection is destitute of one of the attributes
of sovereignty essential to its independence. The army and navy
are the organizations through which a nation demonstrates its strength

in time of War. These will be considered When we come to exam-_ _

ine the war-power of Congress.

§34. To provide for the welfare of its citizens is the ﬁrst duty of
every government. Unable to do this, it Will soon fail to command
the respect, homage, and loyalty of its subjects ; and no government,
especially republican in form, can long exist Without the regard and
affection of the people. It must live, if it live at all, in the hearts
and affections of its -citizens, not “ pinned together with bayonets.”

CHAPTER II.
ORIGIN OF LAND—TITLES IN THE UNITED STATES.

§1. WHEN our fathers conquered their independence, the States
and United States succeeded to whatever title Great Britain pre-
viously had to the territory. I
_ §2. The lapse of time, and general acquiescence, as Well as the
judicial and legislative authorities, have so established this source as
the foundation of land-titles, that its validity can not now be suc-
cessfully called in question. Whether just or unjust, it will prob-
ably remain for ever undisturbed. _
§3. But these remarks are applicable to those lands only which
were obtained through the revolutionary struggle with Great Britain,
resulting in the achievement of our independence. Extensive addi-
tions have been made to the domain of this country by treaties with
other powers; and, of course, the origin of land—titles is traceable
Within any such territory to the treaties through which the titles
have been acquired.

§35. There has been much discussion on the latitude of meaning
of these two words, “general welfare.” The two great political
parties ‘of ‘the country have long been divided on the subject. One
party has insisted that the authority to provide for the general wel-
fare gives power to ‘establish a protective tariﬁ”, to expend the public
money for internal improvements, to facilitate inter-State commerce‘
in improving lake and river harbors, aiding in building railroads of
especial public interest, giving away the public domain to actual
settlers, and in promoting other enterprises having for their object
the welfare of the nation at large. _ The other party has resisted
this broad construction, insisting that the meaning of the words
should be conﬁned within more restricted limits.

1. — ‘WITH FOREIGN NATIONS.

§ 1.~ Congress did not possess the power to regulate commerce

under the Confederation. The want of it involved the country in _

the most serious embarrassments. Foreign countries, and particu-
larly Great Britain, cultivated a monopoliz_ing policy injurious to
this country, and destructive to its navigation. The General Govern-
ment possessing no authority of this kind, the States attempted its
exercise separately, each for themselves; which not only proved

abortive, but engendered rival, conﬂicting, and angry disputes and V

regulations. _ g ,

§ 2. There was no want of harmony in the Constitutional Con-
vention on the proposition that Congress should have power to regu-
late commerce with foreign nations; but many members were in
favor of requiring that no bill regulating or relating to commerce
should be passed. unless two-thirds of both housesvoted in its favor.
All were familiar with the defects of the former‘ policy, and were in

' favor of vesting the power in Congress. If this were done, of

PART 11.] rownas or CONGRESS. ,   167

course the States must Surrender all claim to the right which they

had so disastrously exercised. “ »

§ 3. Judge Story says, that, in different States, “the most oppo-

site and conﬂicting regulations existed.
‘‘ Each pursued its own real or supposed interests. _
-“ Each was jealous of the rivalry of its neighbors. .
“ Each was successively -driven to retaliatory measures. In the

end, lioweverfiall their measures became utterly nugatory, engender- '
ing mutual hostilities, and prostratingall their commerce at the feet’

of foreign nations.”

S. -— AMONG THE STATES.

§4. The disastrous experiences of the past had rendered it
evident‘ that the power to regulate foreign commerce and inter—State
commerce ought to be in the same hands. — Indeed, they could not
safely be separated. ‘ The power to regulate foreign’ commerce, if
vested in Congress, it was believed, might‘ be so exercised as to
compel foreign nations to abandon their selﬁsh policy towards us,
and oblige them to meet us on terms of reciprocity.

§ 5. But if the States were to be allowed to restrict each other,

‘ to cultivate rivalry of interests, and to foster the jealousies of the
past, commerce must languish, and the whole country must suffer. '
If goods landed ormanufactured in New York or Massachusetts ’

could not be sold and conveyed into Pennsylvania or Connecticut
without being burdened with State restrictions, not only would feuds
be cultivated among the States, but foreign commerce would be seri-
ously embarrassed, if not wholly destroyed. If a cargo of tea,
having paid duties is New York, couldnot be sold into New Jersey

I Without being subjectedto State dutiesin the latter State, it would '

. discourage importations, and strike a fatal blow at the national

revenue. , -
§ 6. The power to regulateicommerce among the States, as well
as with foreign nations, was, therefore, wisely placed in the hands of

Congress. It has established our prosperity on a solid and enduring

basis, and raised our country from embarrassment and poverty to

independence and wealth.

_ _ 3.——w1'rH THE INDIAN 'I.‘RIBES._ _ i i
§ 7. Under the Confederation, Congress had the power of “ regu-
lating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians not mem-
bers of any of the States, provided that the legislative right of any
State within its own limits be not infringed or violated.” This did

"not give any rights to Congress over the matter, except outside the

limits of States. A Consequently, there was no uniformity of traffic
with the Indians; and, this creating dissatisfaction anidiig the tribes,
_frequent aggressions and depredations were the result. I I

§ 8. In the ﬁrst draught of the Constitution by the Convention,
there was no clause vesting this poweriin Congress ; but, the draught
being referred to the Committee on the Constitution, this clause was
afterwards inserted and adopted. It was indispensable for three
reasons: —— 4 C
1st. Experience had proved that it was extremely hazardous to leave

it with the States. A

2d. Congress could much more easily command the conﬁdence of

the tribes than any State legislatures. ’ — ’

3d. It was necessary for the preservation of the rights, and for th
defense of the territory, of the Indiainsthemselves.

§ 9. This power of Congress extends to tribes living within ‘or
without the territorial boundaries of the States, and within or with-
out the limits of the United States. Whether the tribes remain on
their original grounds within the States, inhabit unorganized‘ terri-
tory, or "roam at large over lands to which" the United States have
no claim, the trade and commerce with them aresubject to the ex-
clusive regulation of Congress. ‘ ' ’ I

NOTE. —— These provisions of the Constitution give powers to Congress
over matters auxiliary to commerce, and which facilitate and promote its

PART II.] POWERS or CONGRESS. 169

interests. C'omme7'_ce, properly speaking, is the buying and selling or exchan-
ging of commodities between individuals or communities. Commercial is an
adjective which signifies pertaining to, or relating to,cornmerce. Perhaps
it might not have been altogether improper had the powers under this title

. been grouped under the title Commerce. But there is a distinction between

comn1crcialfacil2'ties and commerce itself. The coining of money affords
commercial facilities, though money is not an article of commerce.

1.-—-TO COIN MONEY.

§ 1. This power is one of the ordinary prerogatives of sover-
eignty. It  exercised for the purpose of securing a proper circu-
lation of genuine instead of base coin in commercial transactions.
In orde-r to insure its purity and uniformity of value, the coining of
money is placed exclusively under’ the supervision of the Federal
Government. Money is the common standard by which the value

, of all articles of merchandise and real estate is measured or deter~

mined. Were it left to the States to coin money, there would be no
uniformity in the standard of value; depending, as it would, on
State lines and boundaries.

§ 2. There are several advantages arising from uniformity in
value of the money of the country ; and these could not be secured
were the power to coin it distributed among an indeﬁnite number of
States. The Continental Congress was empowered by the Articles

of Confederation to exercise “the sole and exclusive right and‘

power of regulating the ‘alloy and value of coin struck by their own
authority or by that of the States.” But the country suffered
great inconvenience for Want of uniformity of coinage among the
States. The advantages arising from placing this power exclusively
in the hands of Congress are, ——
1st. The facilitation of exchanges at home and abroad.
2d. The encouragement and stimulus which it imparts, to com-
merce.   - '- . ‘
3d. The barrier which it crects against‘ embarrassments arising from
_ gundueand forced scarcity. .. _
4th. It insures uniformit.y of value, as it insures uniformity of
alloy. C _ _ _
§ 3. Thetotal coinage of money in this _country,; from -1849 to

170   ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

1867, was eight hundred and seventy-four millions of dollars. This
embraces nearly the entire period since the gold-ﬁelds of California
came into the possession of the United States. Coin is manufac-
tured at a place called “the Mint.” The Mint is located iii the
city of Philadelphia, having branches in New York, San Francisco,
and Denver. _ A
2._'ro REGULATE THE VALUE or nomzsrrc com.

§ 4. This is a power conferred on Congress expressly by the Con-
stitution, although it is implied in the power to coin money. This
is especially for the purpose of securing entire uniformity of value,
in order that it may pass from hand to hand in business transactions ;
obviating the necessity of a test being applied to each piece of
money in each commercial transaction. Every piece of money is
stamped in such a manner as to indicate its precise value.

3. —-FOREIGN COIN.
§ 5. There was no provision in the Articles of Confederation for A
ﬁxing the value of foreign coin. In the Constitution, this power is
given to Congress. Without the - power to regulate the value of

foreign coin, it would be‘diﬁ‘icult to regulate’ the value of domestic

com. ’ t ' *

§ 6. ‘Were it not for this power, diﬁ°erent States might attach
different values to the" same piece of foreign coin. Massachusetts
might call apiece of English money, known as a sovereign, ﬁve
dollars ;.and New York, four dollars. A citizen of Massachusetts.
owing a citizen of New York ﬁve thousand dollars, to be paid in
Boston, could compel the latter to accept a thousand sovereigns in L
payment, on Which the citizen of New Yorkwould lose a thousand.
dollars if he used the money at home, ’

§ 7. This would unsettle the value of our own coin as between
those two States, and so in all other States where these discrimi-
nations prevailed. Five -thousand dollars American gold would be
worth much less in New York than in Massachusetts. Not only
so, but foreign coin would cease to possess any ﬁxed and deﬁnite
value by which to determine the value of other things,’ and, in '
unsettling their Value, would unsettle itself. In short, foreign coin

PART II.] POWERS OF ‘CONGRESS. . 171

would become an article of commerce the same as any other

commodity. It would soon be the same with American coin.

‘We see, therefore, that the power to regulate the value of foreign
coin properly belongs with the power to coin money, and regulate
its value, in order to prevent endlesss confusion, as well as the
most serious embarrassments to the commercial interests of the

country.
4.—WEIGI-ITS AND MEASURES.

_§ _8. The power to ﬁx the standard of weights and measures was

doubtless given, says Judge Story, “from like motives of policy,
for the sake of uniformity and the convenience of commerce.
Hitherto, however, it has remained a dormant power, from the many
difficulties attendant upon the subject, although it has been
repeatedly brought to the attention of Congress in most elaborate
reports.

§ 9. “ Until Congress shall ﬁx a standard, the understanding
seems to be that the States possess the power to ﬁx their own
weights and measures; or, at least, the existing standards at the
adoption of the Constitution remain in full force. Under the Con-
federation, Congress possessed the like exclusive power.” But
the exercise of the power was neglected.

5. -— BANKRUPT LAWS.

§ 10. The power to pass‘ or establish uniform laws on the subject
of bankruptcies is classed here as among the commercial interests
of the government. The author had some doubt, at ﬁrst, about the
propriety of placing it here ; but on looking closely at the objects
of this power, the origin and ‘history of bankrupt laws in other coun-
tries, the views entertained by the fathers of the Constitution, a
single paragraph in “ The Federalist,” and the commentaries of
that profound jurist, Judge Story, all doubts that it is commercial
vanish. ’

§11. The power to pass laws--on the subject of bankruptcies

originally belonged to the States, as one of their prerogatives of.’
sovereignty. Of course, laws passed on this subject by the States

would lack uniformity, and consequently, in manyinstances, would

172 ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

work greatinjustice. . A law of this oharacteris regarded as i1_1diS%
pensable to the commercial interests of the-country.

§ 12. A banlirupt is one who owes more.than he can pay. The
objects of the laware twofold :—-f A p . _ T p

First, to enable creditors to secure an appropriation of all the
property of a debtor who fails to pay his debts ; allowing the courts,
in such cases, to give the debtor a complete dischaifge from all in-
debtedness. Second, to_relieve_ unfortunate debtors, on their own
application and surrender of all their property, from perpetual bond-
age to their creditors, and liability to imprisonment. .

§ 13. An insolvent law mustnot be confounded with a bankrupt

law. _ An insolvent law simply relieves from a liability to inépris-_

onment for debt, on the surrender of the debtor’s property to the

cr_editors: it does not discharge the indebtedness itself. In _sucl1_
cases, the future property of the debtor may be seized for his debts,

and appropriated to their payment. On the contrary, a discharge
under a bankrupt law annihilates the debts themselves, and the
creditors have no further claims. A i

_ § 14. Insolvent laws were in existence forty or fifty years ago.

in many of the States, when ‘imprisonment for debt was almost or
quite universal throughout the country ; but they were Slate laws.
In several of the States, they are still, in operation. Under the
power to pass uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies, a bank-

rupt law was passed in 1800, but repealed in 1803 ; another was;
passed in 1841, but repealed a year or two afterwards. ‘A law of

this kind is now in existence, passed March 2, 1867. _ 
§ 15. The Supreme Courtof the United States has decided that

insolvent laws passed by the States are constitutional, but that

ban/erupt laws passedby the States are not constitutional ; because

such laws impair- the obligation of contracts- Congress alone has.

1. —- COUNTERFEITING.

’ § 1. The power to punish, or to prescribe the punishment as it is
here to be understood, for counterfeiting the securities and current
coin of the United States, is a necessity growing out of the power
of Congress to coin money and to regulate its Value. The temptation
to counterfeiting is very great 3 holding out the hope, as it does, of
great rewards for comparatively little labor. '

. § 2. Men of mechanical genius and skill, but wanting integrity,
are to be found in every community, who are willing to take the
risks of detection and‘ punishment"; hoping, however,’ to escape both;
The ﬁnest artistic ingenuity is often prostituted to this purpose, and

too often with success.‘ ‘Counterfeiting consists in 1nakingi_mitations'

of coin, bank-bills, or other securities,’approaching so near to alike;

ness of the originals as to deceive" a personof but "ordinary expe-

rien_ce.

_. § 3.‘ VVithout the power to attach severe ‘penalties to crimes of
this grade, the securities and coin’ of the United States would soon-
becomecomparatively worthless ; the country would be ﬁlled’ with

spurious bills, bonds, and coin; and it would not be long before

moneywwould cease to be a medium of exchange among the im‘as.ses,u

Who are unskilled in detecting the basefrom, the genuine.

i2.-——PIRACIES AND FELONIES ON THE HIGH_ SEAS‘.

§ 4. Congress is vested with power to deﬁne and punish piracies

and. felonies when committed on the high seas. "Any»fel’o‘ny' commit-"

ted on the high seas comes under the common-law deﬁnition of
piracy. By common law,,;_pi1*acy, can __no__t , be committed on land,

unless it be on an island of the sea’. Sir VVilliam Blackstone

deﬁnes piracy at common law to consistiin committing those acts of

~ robbery and depredation on _ the high seas, which, ‘if 'co_mmi'tted on

land,‘ would amount to‘ felony.‘

174 ANALYSIS on crvrr. GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

§ 5. The sa.me author says that piracy is an offense against the
universal law of society. A pirate renounces all the beneﬁts of
society and government, and reduces himself afresh to the savage
state of nature, and declares war against all mankind. By the
statutes of England, however, various modiﬁed deﬁnitions have
been given to this crime, essentially changing its common-law import.
Statutes are often passed changing the common-law deﬁnitions of
crimes. A ‘

§ 6. In pursuance of this power to deﬁne piracy, Congress has

passed several acts on the subject. For instance, in 1820, the C

foreign slave-trade Was made piracy, punishable by death. From
the foundation of our government until 1808, the foreign slave-trade
was lawful commerce. Congress has the power to enlarge or con-
tract the deﬁnition of piracy from its common-law meaning.

§ 7. Felony is another word of common-law deﬁnition. The
author last quoted deﬁnes it to be every species of crime which at
common law occasioned the forfeiture of the lands and goods of the
criminal ; and this happens most frequently in those crimes for which
a capital punishment is or was inﬂicted. This deﬁnition has under-
gone various changes by act of the British Parliament. F

§ 8. By the clause in the Constitutionunder consideration, Con-
gress is at liberty to depart from the common-law meaning. of the
word “ felony.”- Felony can hardly be said to be a crime; for it is
a word of generic import, including a large number of crimes, such

as murder, larceny, arson, burglary, &c. When committed on

the high seas, it could not properly be left with the States to deﬁne

it, as the jurisdiction of offenses not committed within State limits i

must necessarily be restricted to the Federal courts. .

§ 9. The high seas are deﬁned by Judge Story to “ embrace not
only the waters of the ocean which are out of sight of land, but
the waters on the sea-coast below low-water mark, whether within
the territorial boundaries of a nation or of a domestic State.”

§ 10. The power to deﬁne offenses against the law of nations
must be considered here as restricted to American citizens. There

are responsible in some sense to neighboring nations for all violations
of. the laws of nations by their citizens. Out of this responsibility
may grow the issues of war.

3.—I’UNISHING THESE CRIMES.

§ 11. The same considerations that render it proper for Con-
gress to have the power of deﬁning these crimes, also render it
proper that they should have the power" of annexing to them suita-
ble penalties. Criminal law would be nugatory without penalties.
On account of our relations to foreign neighboring nations, it seems
in the highest degree proper that this power of deﬁning and pun-
ishing offenses of the class herein speciﬁed should belong exclu-
sively to the National Legislature.

4. —— PUNISHMENT FOR TREASON.

,§ 12. The Constitution deﬁnes the crime of treason, but leaves
it with Congress to prescribe its punishment. In 1790, Congress
afﬁxed to this crime the penalty of death. In 1862, Congress
passed another act, punishing treason with death, or imprisonment
for not less than ﬁve years, and a ﬁne of ten thousand dollars, and

the slaves of the party convicted to be free. This act was passed -

before the abolition of slavery in the United States.

1. -— POST-OFFICES.

§ 1. The power vested in Congress by the Constitution to estab-
lish post-oﬁices and post-roads is presumed to include all other
powers necessary to render them effective’. Any plan that should
leave the supervision of the post-ofﬁce department in the hands of
the several States would necessarily be inefﬁcient. _

§ 2. The several Statesfand the citizens thereof, are bound to-
gether by ties of interest, commerce, and affection, rendering it
indispensable that they shouldhave some reliable and uniform means
of communication with each other. These beneﬁts could not be

CHAPTER III.
COMMON LAW IN THE COLONIES.

§1. WHEN territory is found uninhabited- atthe origin of new
settlements therein, it is usual to adopt the laws of the nation from
which the settlers have migrated, so far as they may be found ap-
plicable to the new condition of things.

Although this country was occupied by a wild, uncultivated, and
savage population, without law or government in any civilized sense,
the colonists chose to consider themselves as settling an urzivzlzabdted
territory. As a large proportion of the new settlers of these Colonies
were from England, they would naturally lean to the jurisprudence
of that country.

§ 2. It must be remembered, also, that the Colonies were nearly
all settled under the patronage and favor of Great Britain. Those
that were not, soon came under the jurisdiction of the British
Crown. '

§ 3. These are the principal circumstances that led to the adoption
of the English common law among the North—American Colonies,
and which constitutes to a great extent, at the present time, the
system of jurisprudence in this country.

CHAPTER IV.
COLONIAL GOVERNMENTS.

THE Colonial Governments may properly be divided into three
classes : —— A
1. PROVINCIAL,
2. PROPRIETARY, and
3. 'CIIA.ETEE.

1. P-rominicial Governments.
§ 1. The Provincial Governments were wholly under the control

'of"the sovereign of Great Britain. They emanated from his

derived from the adoption of as 1nany..dift’e1'ent. postal‘ systems as
there are States in the Union. * —< ‘ . S .
§ 3.‘ Besides, the burdens would be unequal. It is far more ex-

pensive to transport the mails through the sparsely-populated regions '

of the ‘Vest, South, and South—v«fest,in proportion to the amountof

matter conveyed and distance traveled, than it is through the more

densely inhabited regions of the East and North. Yet it is in a

high degree important to the Whole country that the forest and the "

prairie be subjectedto the hand of cultivation.

.§ 4. And Who Will become pioneer, if he must be shut out from
all_ communication with that world which he has left behind ? Hardly
one in a thousand of the hardy, industrious settlers who have peo-
pled the Western and South-western. States would have left their

homes in the East to undergo the privations of a new country, N:

Were there no facilities for the transmission of intelligence to and from
the friends of other days. V

S § 5. The general superintendence and direction of the post—ofﬁce
department is under the care ofrthe Postmaster-General. . He has
the establishing of post-ofﬁces, appoints most of the postmasters,
and has the letting of the contracts for carrying the mails. For

some of the larger oﬂices, to the number of nearly a thousand, the ;
appointments of postmasters is made on nomination of the President, I

by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
§ 6. Few of the pupils, or even of the teachers, of the common

schools of the present day, remember the days of dear postage_._
Until 1845, postage was much higher than at present. Letter post- '

age Was as follows: --

Each letter conveyed less than 30 miles . .i S . 6 .cts,
e“ “ “ over 30 and less than 80 miles . 10 cts.

of letter postage thus : ——

§ 8, At the second session of the Thirty-ﬁrst Congress, which
convened Dec. 2, 1850, another act was passed, reducing -still
lower the price of letter postage, to take effect July 1, 1851. Under
this act, ——-’ .
Each letter prepaid, Weighing not over half an ounce, and
conveyed not over 3,000 miles, Wholly within the.

For any distance exceeding 3,000 miles, double these rates.
‘Double weight (that is, one ounce), double charges; triple Weight,
triple charges ; and so on ; every additional weight of half an ounce

or less to be charged with anadditional single postage.

For letters sent to foreign countries, various rates were estab-
lished (higher than these), the rates depending on the countries
to which the letters are sent. ’ ‘

§ 9. When at ﬁrst cheap postage was established, there Wasa .

great deﬁciency in the ﬁnances of the post-oﬁice department for
several years. The income did not equal the expenses until 1861,
when the mails Were withdrawn from the insurgent States of the
South. On account of the less expense of transporting the mails
at the North in proportion to receipts, the post-office department
exhibited abetter-ﬁnancial condition after the mails were withdrawn
from the Southern States.

§10. The report of the Postmaster-,Greneral, dated Nov. 26,
1867, shows that there were in operation in the United States, June
30, 1867, ~post~ofﬁces tothe number of 25,162 ; and that the
Receipts from all sources during the year Were $19,978,693.54

§ 11. It is encouraging to know, that, under the cheap-postage

planawith which the American people are now favored, the post-ofﬁce
departmentvis self-sustaining. The introduction of cheap postage
encouraged and stimulated correspondence of all kinds, to such

- extent as to produce this result. » Some idea may be formed of the

progress of the postal system in this country, when it is known, that,

12

178 ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

at the adoption of our Constitution in 1789, there were but seventy-
ﬁve. post-offices in the United States. Now, including ofﬁces soon
to be opened at the South, which were closed during the Rebellion,
there" are not far from thirty thousand. In 1790, the receipts of
the department were $37,935 ,' in 1867, almost twenty millions.
The aggregate number of miles traveled in carrying the mail, in
1790, was 7,365 ; in 1867, almost seventy-two millions.

2. — POST—ROAD S.

§ 12. It has not been necessary, except in a few instances, that
Congress should exercise their power to establish post-roads. In
some cases, however, this power has been found necessary, and Con-
gress has used it. But generally the roads already opened by the
inhabitants of the country through which the mails are conveyed
have been found sufficient. They are regularly selected, and de-
clared, however, to be post-roads, before being used as such. The
waters on our rivers and lakes, over which travel is public and reg-
ular, are, in many instances, establishedas post-roads in. this Way.

§ 13. June 30, 1867, there were 6,930 mail-routes in operation
within the limits of the United States. The aggregate length of

these mail-routes is 180,921 miles. The aggregate cost of carrying‘

the mails over these routes for the year ending June 30, 1867,ewas
$8,410,184.00. The mails are carried by private individuals, or
by railroad or steamboat companies, the contract being made with
the Postmaster-General in behalf of the United States. He adver-
tises for bidders,‘and lets the contract in each case to the lowest
responsible bidder. Bonds are given by the mail-carriers to the
government, with good and acceptable sureties, for the faithful exe-
cution of the contract. Thoseiwho are in immediate charge of the

t mails are sworn to the faithful discharge of their duties.

12‘ —— COPYRIGHT.

§ 1. The power to make provisions for patent and copy rights did

, not belong to Congress under the Coniieueration ; but, in the Con-

stitutional Convention, there was no opposition to these provisions.
The necessity of some’ law of this kind was not only conceded by
that body, but by the universal acquiescence of the country.

§ 2. Few men who are wealthy are disposed to take the ﬁeld of
authorship, however competent they may be. This rule, however,

' has its exceptions. But the poor man, it will be admitted, can not

afford to devote himself to the production of valuable books, if the
fruits of his industry may be appropriated by others without reward.

§ 3. The States‘ could not aﬂbrd the necessary protection to
authors ; for their legislation could only cover their own respective
territorial boundaries. Few books would be written requiring elab.-
orate authorship, the sale of which, in the estimation of the author,
was destined to be conﬁned to the limits of a single State. That _a
man has the same right to the labor of his brains that he has to the
labor of his hands will hardly be questioned.

§ 4. Judge Story says, “ No class of men a_re more meritorious,

‘or are better entitled to public patronage, than authors and iI1V€I1i'r'

ors. They have rarely obtained, as the histories of their lives sufﬁe
ciently establish, any due encouragement and reﬁward "for their inge-
nuity and, public spirit-. They have often languished in povert-y,
and died in neglect; while the world has derived immense wealth
from their labors, and science and the arts have reaped unbounded
advantage from their discoveries.”

§ 5. Under the laws of Congress, the steps are very simple to
secure a copyright. A copyright may be secured to authors for
books, maps, charts, musical compositions, cuts, and engravings, or
for anyother literary and scientiﬁc productions. J The copyright ex-
tends for twenty-eight years: and if, at the end of that time, the
author is still living, he may obtain its extension for fourteen. years
longer ; or, if dead, his living representatives may obtain its exten-

monopolyiof the sale of his p1'oductionsifor forty-two years.

§ 6. _The steps to secure a copyright are these 2 Before publica-
tion, a, printed copy of the work proposed to be published, or its
titlepage, must be deposited in the office of the Clerk of the District
Court of the United States in the district of the author’s residence.
‘Within three months after publishing the work, a full copy of the
work ‘must be delivered to the clerk aforesaid, which he transmits
to the Secretary of State, to be kept in his office at the seat of
government. Within the same period, a copy must be furnished to
the Smithsonian Institute at Washington, and also one to the Con-
gressional Library. V

§ 7. The owner of the copyright must give notice to every reader _

of his work that he has securedthe copyright according to act of
Congress. A This notice is printed on the titlepage, or on the page
succeeding, in the following words : i-—- T V W I I

them, in every edition of the work. The expense of securing a
copyright is but triﬂing, -—..- one or two dollars.

proprietor of a book, pamphlet, map, chart, musical composition,

print, engraving, or phot_ograph, for which a copyright shall have

been obtained, -t'o"de*liver'a' printed copy of the ‘same to the Con-

2. — PATENT-RIGHT.

§ 9. Patents are issued by the patent-office at Washington, giving

ture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
of them, the monopoly in their manufacture and sale. This patent-

letters-patent. To obtain letters-patent the applicant must inake a
distinct speciﬁcation, giving a full and complete description of his
invention ; and, in cases admitting of drawings and models, these must
be made, and all deposited with the Commissioner of Patents.

§ 10. The applicant’s discovery or invention must not have been
in use or on sale more than two years before making his -application’
for letters-patent. The patent-ofﬁce beloiigs to the,Department of

the Interior. The applicant must swear that he believes himself to V

be the original inventor of whatever he seeks to have patented.

§ 11. Examination is made at the patent-oiﬁce, not only of that-

which is proposed to be patented, but of other models, drawings,
and speciﬁcations deposited in the office, in order to ascertain
whether there is any conﬂict of claims- If none are found, and that
which is offered isiregarded as patentable, letters-patent are issued
under the seal of the Department, giving to the patentee, his heirs
and assigns, the exclusive right to control the manufacture and sale of
the patented article for fourteen years. Letters-patent cost the pat-

entee thirty-ﬁve dollars, ﬁfteen of which must accompany the V appli-

cation: twenty more must be paid on their issue.

182 ANALYSIS or GIVILLGOVERNMENT. [PART II.

1.-—DECLA,RA'I.‘ION or WAR.

§ 1.  declaration of war is a ‘solemn, formal, and deliberate no-
tice to all the world in general, and. particularly to’ the citizens of

, both nations involved, that hostilities actually exist, or are about to

commence. The nation declaring war generally recites in the dec-
laration the wrongs and aggressions of which complaint is made;

‘thus making a direct appeal to the great family of nations in justi-

fication of the measure.» “ A decent respect for the opinions of man-
kind,” as well as for the rights of neutral nations who may have
indirect interests in the conflict, could scarcely require less. A war

betW€€I1 l?W0 powerful nations jars the commercial interests of every

nation on the globe.

§ 2. The power to declare war is one of the prerogatives of the
sovereign of Great Britain"; and it belongs to the sovereigns of

, most other countries. Sir William Blackstone says that V“ the right

of making war, which by nature subsisted in every individual, is
given up by all private persons that enter into society, and is vested
in the sovereign power. This right is given up, not only by indi-
viduals, but by the entire body of the people who are under the
dominion of the sovereign.” ~

§ 3. In this country, the will of the people is the sovereign ; at
least, this is our theory. Could that will be deﬁnitely ascertained
without delay, the power to declare war should be vested"-in the
people. But, practically, the will of the people can be known
through their representatives only, and hence the war-power is vested
in Congress. V

§ 4. In the Convention that formed the Constitution, there was a
variety of opinion on the propriety of placing this power in the
hands of Congress. One class of members was for vesting it in the
Senate only ;- a second for vesting it in the President ; a third fa-
vored the plan of conferring it on both ‘Senate, and President ; a fourth
Was for giving it to Congress, and this proposition prevailed.

§ 5. Before a declaration of warcan be made, the subject must
receive the most solemn and deli_ber__a_te attention of the representa-
tives of the people in Congress assembled. A declaration of war
is an exercise of the highest prerogative of national sovereignty;

PART II.] S Pownns on CONGRESS. 183

and its effects on other nations and individuals, as well as on the
nations and individuals more irnrnediately involved,’are so direful
and calamitous, that it can not be justified except as a last resort.

§ 6. -When a formal and solemn declaration of war has been
made by Congress, peace can be secured only through the negotia-
tions of ambassadors or ministers representing the contending pow-
ers. After the ministerial_ or ambassadorial conference has agreed
on the terms of peace, the power to accept or reject those terms on
the part of the United States belongs to the President and Senate.
As we have seen in considering the Senate-powers, it requires a
majority of two-thirds of the members present to ratify any treaty,
including a treaty of peace.

2.—MARQUE AND REPRISAL.
§ 7. The power to declare War doubtless implies the power to

grant letters of ‘marque and reprisal. Letters of this kind are
sometimes issued by the government to prevent the necessity of a

resort to war, though they are incident to the war-making power. V

They are frequently issued before a declaration of War. They are
grantable by the law of nations, says Blackstone, whenever the sub-
jects of one Stateiare oppressed or injured by those of another, and
justice is denied by that State to which the oppressor belongs. '

§ 8. Marque signiﬁes, as here used, a license from the gov-
ernment to pass beyond the limits or jurisdiction of one’s own coun-
try ; and reprisal signiﬁes a taking in return. Letters of marque

and re arisal are a commission from the overnment authorizin the '
g

bearer to pass beyond the boundaries of his own country for the
purpose of capturing prizes of the enemy, consisting of their persons
or. goods. Whatever is so captured is held under certain regulations
until satisfaction "shall be made to the government or individuals
injured. ’ ‘

;§ 9. This commission saves the bearer of it, and his crew, from .

the liability, if captured themselves, of being tried, convicted, and
punished as pirates. In case it so happens in their conﬂicts that

' they are taken prisoners, they have the protection of their govern-

ment that they shall‘ be treated as prisoners. of war ; and", in ‘case

they should be i treated .otherwise,itheir own , government would. re- _‘

taliate.
3. —, CAPTURES.
§  But it is necessary that rules should be adopted concerning
captures made, whether on land or water. Cengress is authorized
by the Constitution to make these rules, which, when made, become

laws the same as any other laws; and,for the purpose of enforcing V“

them, courts of admiralty have been established, whose business it
is to inquire into the legality of the course pursued in taking these
prizes. Persons might go out in pursuit of prizes, having no au-
tho_rity, or, having authority, might capture from the ships of
neutrals; or an illegal course might be pursued after capture, though
the capture itself were legal. ‘ A i ' '
§ 11. “The cognizance of all ‘captures’ or prizes,” says Black-

stone, “ andtheir incidents, belong exclusively to the courts‘ of the. r
country to which theicaptors belong, and from whom they derive their '
authority to make their captures. The remedy for illegal ‘acts of ' T
capture is by the institution of proper prize-proceedings in the prize-

courts of the captors.” _ C
T H is ' 4.—TI~IE ARMY.

§"1i2i. The other war-powers vested in Congress would be utterly C
useless without the power to raise and support armies. Probably no
power of Congress mentioned in the Constitution met with so strong .

opposition before the people asthis one to raise and support armies.
It wasurged with great force and vehemenee, that, being unlimited, it
would be dangerous to the liberties of the people, and would ﬁnally
result in the establishment of a military despotism. T

§ 13. This clause refers to the regular or standing army. Con- T
gress had no such power under the Confederation. All they could

do was “to agree on the number of land-forces, and to make requisi-
tion on each State for its quota, in proportion to the number of white
inhabitants in such State.” True, these requisitions were to be

binding on’ the States; but the government must wait their conve- V '

nience and disp_osition.

§ 14. The army is "created by enlistrnents under the acts of Con- V
gress. The enlistment is for ﬁve years in the regular army, In

PART 11.] Pownns oricoiveanss. , p 185

5.—'1‘HE NAVY.“ C u A
§ 165. The Articles of Confederation gave to Congress the power
“ to build and equip a navy.” But, in the Constitutional Conven-
tion, the words “to provide and maintaina navy 7 were accepted,

_as having greater breadth, and appropriateness of meaning. .

§ 16. The navy consists of the entire number of ships of war

belonging to a nation or people considered collectively. A navy is

necessary forthe protection of our ﬁsheries, commerce, and naviga-
tion. _ ‘We need it not only on the ocean, but on our lakes, and on
several of our rivers, and this even in time of peace. '

§,17. . But, in time of war, a navy becomes indispensable to a peo-

_ pleiwhose geographical position is like ours. ' VVG have a long line
of ‘scaboard,'through which we areexposed to the depredations of _

hostile ﬂeets and invading armies. Located on that seaboard are

some of our most important, flourishing, and populous cities. The ‘

possession’ of the chief commercial cities in any country by an

enemy in time of war gives him a great advantage in the contest."
—He can exact contributions of the inhabitants for the support of his

army. 6

“§”18'. In the earlier years of our history, our -navy’ found"‘but' 6
little favor in the popular estimation. ' ‘Judge Story says, _ “ It was

not .until during the late War with Great Britain (1812), when” our

little navy‘, by a gallantry and brilliancy of achievement almost ’_

Without a parallel, had literally fought itself into favor, ‘that the

nation at large began to awake from its lethargyon tliissubject, and i

to insist upon a policy which should at once make us respected and
formidable abroad, and secure protection and honor at home.”

'§ 19. According to the report of the Secretary of the Navy,:

dated Dec. 3, 1866, the total number of vessels in that department

of the public service at that time was two hundred and seventy- ,
eight. ' Of these, there were in commission and on active duty one

hundred and ﬁfteen vessels, carrying one thousand and twenty-nine 6‘

authority, and had no ﬁxed constitution of government. The king
issued his commissions to the royal governors from time to time,
accompanied with speciﬁc instructions which were to be obeyed.

§ 2. The governors were, under these governments, regarded as
the representatives or deputies of the king. The king also
appointed a council, having limited legislative authority, who
were to assist the governor in the discharge. of his official duties.
Both governor and council held their ofﬁces during the royal
pleasure.-

§ 3. The governor had authority to convene a general assembly
of the representatives of the freeholders and planters of the Prov-
ince. The governor, council, and representatives constituted the
Provincial Assembly. a

§ 4. Provincial Assembly, constit.uted of,

1st. THE REPRESENTATIVES, ——Lower House;
2d. THE COUNCIL, — Upper House ;
 THE GOVERNOR,-- ,

having a veto on all the proceedings of the two houses, with power
also to prorogue and dissolve them. These constituted the local
law-making power, subject to the approval or disapproval of the
Crown.

§ 5. The governor appointed the judges and magistrates.

Under this form of government were included the Colonies of
New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Caro-

lina, Georgia.

2. Proprietary Governments.

§ 6. The meaning of the word proprietary is owner, or proprie-
tor. The proprietor, or proprietary, derived not only the title to the
soil, but also the general powers of government, from the king.
The powers of government extended over the whole territory so
granted, which became a‘ kind of dependent royalty.

§‘7. Under these governments, the governors were appointed by
the proprietary or proprietaries. Theilegislature was convened and
organized according to the will of the proprietary. He also had the
appointment of officers of every grade.

186 ANALYSIS on CIVIL_GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

6.—RULES FOR ARM)’ AND NAVY.

§ 20. Nothing need be said to. vindicate the policy and necessity
of vesting in Congress the power to make rules for the government
and regulation of the land and naval forces. It naturally follows
the power to raise and support armies, and to provide and maintain

a navy. This clause was not in the first draught of the Constitution,.

as appears from the Madison Papers ; but it was afterwards inserted
as an amendment, witliout opposition.

7. —— THE MILITIA.

§21. The next-power of Congress to be considered is that of

g‘p‘ providing for, organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia.”

The country could not safely rely solely on its standing army for any
and every emergency that might arise. The Constitution, therefore,
gives Congress jurisdiction over the militia of the several States,
and this power of providing for, organizing, arming, and disciplining
them, as incidental to that jurisdiction. The States have the ap-

ppointment of the ofﬁcers over, and the "training of, the militia, as we
_ shall see when we come to treat of the rights of States; but this

must he done as directed by Congress.
§ 22. Congress is authorized also to make provision for governing

-such part of the militia as may be employed in the service of the

United States. Rigid discipline and government have always been
found necessary in the army, whether constituted of regulars or
militia. This government must be uniform to be salutary. To be

uniform, it must emanate from a single source. It would not do,

therefore, to leave the government of the militia in the employ of
the nation in the hands of the several States in which they might
enlist. _ A .
§ 23. There are three purposes for which Congress may provide
for ‘calling forth the militia of the several States : --

First, To execute the laws of _the Union ;

Second, To suppress insurrections; C

A Third, To repel invasions. T

The organizationiof the militia is maintained at an expense com-

paratively triﬂing when the advantages to the country are considered.

The nation must have the means at its command for carrying on a
foreign war, as well as for maintaining its authority at home; and
the following reasons favor the militia system : —— ‘

1st. Recent experience has demonstrated that but a few months
of discipline are necessary to insure bravery, courage, and fortitude,
in the ﬁeld of conﬁict, on the part of the militia. They have crowned
themselves with immortal honor, and have added unfading luster
to the national reputation.

2d. An agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial community
like ours will be unlikely to become involved in long and expensive
Wars at home or abroad. But few instances in our history have
occurred when it has been necessary to call forth the militia of the
several States in any considerable numbers and for any great -length
of time. Our history, thus far, has proved that it is more'economi-
cal to keep up an extensive militia organization of the States than
to keep a large standing army in the ﬁeld. ‘ »

3d. The President of the United States is commander-in-chief
of the army and navy -at all times, and of the militia of the several
States when called into actual Service of the government. He can
not call forth the militia except under provisions made by Congress.

sVarious acts of Congress have been passed, at different times,

deﬁning the emergencies under which the President may call forth
the militia. He is to be sole judge of the necessity to call them
forth. At the close of the late Rebellion, 1865, over one million
of the militia were mustered out of service within a few months,
and returned to the industrial pursuits of the country. i

§ 24. It is believed that the ‘standing armies of the world are
now larger than they have been at any time since the great wars of
the ﬁrst Napoleon. The army of the United States now numbers
nearly ﬁfty-ﬁve thousand men. The annual cost of our army at
present is nearly one hundred million dollars.

The army of France has been ﬁxed at seven hundred and ﬁfty
thousand men in the “ active” army, and ﬁve hundred and ﬁfty
thousand in the “passive; ” the latter being called “the National
Guard Mobile.” Total, thirteen hundred thousand men available

but it is generally in excellent condition, and supplied with the best
arms to be procured. a I i " " i ' I ‘A

Although crimescommi_tted within any State are to be tried in the
State Where they are committed, yet they may be committed on the
high seas, or within the limits of ‘ unorganized Territories. This

‘ Am. IX.-—NATURALIZATION.

C To cstablis/L Ct um:f07~m rule of m‘ctu.rcr.Zizctti0n. 29.
j § 1. Naturalization is that legal process by which an alien or a

foreigner becomes a citizen of the United States. Congress has eX--
clusive control over this subject. Under the Confederation, this

power did not belong to Congress, but to the. States. In. the Con?
stitutional_Convention, there was no opposition to giving it to Con-
gress. Distributed among the several States, under the Confedera-T
tion,it had been a source of great embarrassment, on account of the

diiferent conditions for naturalization required by the different

States. a V - -

'.§ 2. An alien is one who is born- in a foreign country. This
deﬁnition does not applyto children bornin foreign countries, whose

arents are citizens of the United States, and are tern Jorarilv
P l .2’

absent on the public business of the United States. Such children
are considered as nat-ive~born. . t . .
V §  Under the Confederation, New York might require ten

years’- residence of an alien before he could become naturalized; ’

r Pennsylvagia might require six years, New Jersey three, and Con-

190 ANALYSIS OF CIVIL GOVERN1‘/IENT. [Paar II.

necticut one. Yet if a foreigner’ became naturalized in Connecti-
cut, where but one year’s residence was required, he might remove
to New York in a year or two after naturalization, and claim’ all the
privileges of citizenship in the latter State. For the f1'.eeiinhabit-
ants of each State were “ entitled to all the privileges and immunities
of free citizens in the several States.” Thus a citizen of any State
was a citizen of any other State inwhich he might become a resi-
dent. '

§ 4. Congress, having the Whole control of this subject under the

Constitution, passed a law in 1790 requiring two years’ residence
before a foreigner could become naturalized. In 1795, the act
was amended, requiring ﬁve years’ residence. In 1798, the period
was extended to fourteen years : but it was reduced in 1802 to ﬁve
years; since which there has been no alteration as to time, except
with regard to soldiers. A soldier, having served one year in the
Union army, and having obtained an honorable discharge, may
become a citizen of the United States on making oath to these facts,
and taking the oath of allegiance to our government.

§ 5. At any time after a foreigner has become a resident in this
country, he may make his declaration of intention on oath, before a
court of competent jurisdiction, to_ become a citizen of the United
States. The following is a declaration of intention now on ﬁle in
the clerk’s office for the county of Monroe, New York : -

sovereignty whatever, and particularly to the sovereign of Great
Britain, of whom I am a subject. '

§ 6. Five years must have ‘elapsed after a foreigner becomes a”

resident, and two years after ‘declaration of intention as above,
before he can become a citizen. The declaration of intention may
he made any time within three years, or longer, after becoming a
resident ; but at least two years_ must intervene after declaration of
intention before taking the oath of allegiance, which is the last step
in order to become a citizen.‘ '. ~

§7. The oath of allegiance must be preceded by the oath of

other witnesses to the ﬁve‘ years’ residence and ‘good character of the T

applicant. Thesewitnesses must be citizens of the United States,
and swear that they are well ‘ acquainted with the said applicant
(Patrick Flannigan) ;‘ that he has resided in the United States for
ﬁve years last past, and for the last year in the State of New York;
and that, during that time, he l1as behaved as a man of good moral
character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the
United States. '

‘§ 8. The oath of allegiance will then be administered to Patrick
Flannigan, and will read substantially thus : —— I

‘_‘ I,_ Patrick Flannigan, do solemnly swear that I will support the

Constitution of the United States ; and that I hereby renounce and
abjureall allegianceand ﬁdelityto everyforeign prince, potentate,
state, and Sovereignty whatever, and particularly to the Queen of
England, of whom I am a subject. So help me, God.

§ 9. When a foreigner becomes naturalized, his children under
twenty-one years of age, if residents of the ‘United States at the
time, become citizens without further formality. If a foreigner
makes his declarationof intention to become a citizen of the United
States, and dies before the time to become naturalized, his wife and
children may become citizens at that time. on taking the necessary

oath. in . ' ‘ ,

§ 10. By act of Congress passed in 1855,; “persons heretofore-

and are hereby declared to be, citizens of the United States; pro-
vided, however, that the rights of citizenship shall not descend to

' 1. — G.0V'ERNMEN'I‘.

§ 1. Ownership of territory by any government implies the right
to govern it ; and the right to govern implies the right to make. all
needful rules and regulations for that purpose. But the authors of
the'Constitution saw‘ fit" to incorporate into‘ that instrument this power
to govern, which is but in afﬁrmance of well-known principles of law
in such cases.   ,   _

§ 2. It seems to be admitted by all political parties at the present

day‘ that the United States’ possess the right to acquire territory.

The government has acted on this right from the _beginning. " By
the liberality of the States owning it, the General Government had
acquired that immense region known as the N orth-western Territory

APART IL] r r ~ POWERS on oonennss.” 9 s 7193

before the adoption of the Constitution; Since the ‘adoption, our

-territory has been greatly extended in tlie acquisition of Louisiana,

Florida, California, and the Russian possessions in America.
§ 3. It is the duty of Congress to make the necessary rules and

_ adopt the necessary measures to govern this vast territory, until such

time as, by the increase of its population, it shall be divided and
erected into independent States, ‘and admitted into the Union.
More than a dozen States have already been formed from this ac-
quired territory, and have been adopted as members of the National

‘ Union. '

2.——SEAT or GOVERNMENT.

§ 4. Speaking of the powers of Congress over the seat of gov-

ernment, Judge Story says, “ A moment’ s consideration Will establish

the importance and necessity of this power. VVithout it, the National
Government Would have no adequate means to enforce _its authority
in the place in which its public functionaries should, be convened.
‘They might be insulted "and their proceedings might be interrupted

‘With impunity. And, if’ the State in Which. it Were situated

should array itself in hostility to the proceedings’ of the’ National
Government, the latter might be driven to seek another asylum, or
be compelled to a humiliating submission to the State authorities.

§ 5... “Nor let it be thought that the evil is Wholly imaginary.
It actually occurred to the Continental Congress at the very close
of the Revolution,"Who”were compelled to quit Philadelphia, and
adjourn to Princeton, in order toescape from the violence of some
insolent mutineers of the‘ Continental army. ~ ,

§ 6. f‘ It is under this clause that the cession of the present Dis-,
trict of a Columbia Was made by the States of Maryland and Virginia
to the,National Government; andthe present seat of the National

Cr,0vern1nent..Wa.s established" at. thecity. of V_Vasl1ington in 1800.-

194 ANALYSIS oIro1v1L GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

§ 7.‘ Before the year 1800, the seat. of government was not per-
manently ﬁxed at anyplace ; and, being moved as it was from‘ place
to place, the public suffered great inconvenience. It had been
temporarily established at the following places, at the following
dates: —-‘- ’ ' ' i 7 ‘

3. — PUBLIC WORKS.

§ 8. If the National Government needs a site for the erection of
a fort, magazine, arsenal, dock-yard, or any other building, there
are two steps necessary to procure it: ﬁrst, the consent of Con-
gress; ‘and, second, the consent, of the legislature of - the State in
which the proposed site is. c When the cession is made, the govern-
ment comes into full possession; and now Congress may exercise
over such place exclusive legislation. .

§ 9. Unless the State of which such purchase is made reserves
the right, no legal State authority canbe exercised in such places,
even to the serving of writs of anykind, civil or criminalf All
judicial jurisdictionin such cases is national. If crimes are com-
mitted in such places, they must be tried in the United-States courts.
Judge Story says, however, thatthe States have generally reserved
in such cessions the right to serve all State processes, civil and crimi-
nal; upon. persons found therein. “

§ 10. The object of such reservations when they are made is,
that these places shall not ‘become retreats and asylums for fugitives
from justice who may be guilty of crimes against State _ authority;

Almost every State has more or less of these places Within its limits

§ 11. The power to dispose of the territory belonging. to the
United States has been discussed in another place, and therefore

need not be repeated here. (See Art. I. of Chap IV., Part II.)

5. - NEW STATES.

§ 12. By reference to the Articles of Confederation, it will be
seen that Canada was to be admitted into the Union by “ acceding to
the Confederation, and joining in the measures of the United States; ”
but no other (British) Colony was to be admitted unless such ad-
mission Were agreed to by nine States. Nothing is to be found in
those articles providing for the admission of new States into the
Union. This was an important omission, as the events of our
history since the adoption of the Constitutionihave proved.

§ 13. At the close of the Revolutionary War, there were immense

tracts of vacant territory lying within the chartered limits of several

of the States. These States, with this extensive domain, constituted,
in‘ part, the area of the Confederation. This vacant territory, as well
as the territory of the States proper, had been Wrested from British
jurisdiction by the common efforts, sacriﬁees,'treasure, and blood of
the inhabitants of all the States engaged in the struggle. '

§ 14. Several of the States were reluctant to ratify the Articles
of Confederation, and refused to come into the Union unless this
vacant territory should become the common property of the National
Government. Congress earnestly urged the States holding this ter-
gitory to surrender their claims for the common beneﬁt of all the

tates. r

.§ 15. On the 10thof October, 1780, the Congress of the Con-
federation L ’ _ A _ 1

:‘ Resolved, That the unappropriated lands that may be ceded or
relinquished to the United States by anyp'articular States, pursuant

to a recommendation of Congress made 6th September of the same

§ 8. Lord Baltimore held Maryland, and William Penn held
Pennsylvania and Delaware, under this form of government, and as
proprietaries. ~

3. Charter Governments.

§ 9. These were, in many respects, not unlikeour State Govern-
ments. They were created by letters patent, or grants of the
Crown, which conferred the soil within the limits deﬁned, and all the
powers of government, on‘ the grantees and their associates and suc-
cessors. These charters were Similar to some of our State Constitu-
tions, distributing the powers of government into three departments,
—— legislative, executive, and judicial. , -

§ 10. They deﬁned the powers of the different branches of the

government, and secured to the inhabitants certain political privi-

leges and rights “The appointment and authority of the governor, =

the formation and structure of the legislature, and the establishment
of courts of justice, were specially provided for ; and generally the

"powers appropriate to each were deﬁned.”

Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had charter gov-
ernments.

CHAPTER V.
CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

§ 1. THE Colonies were not sovereignties in any political sense,
not being endowed with power to enter into alliances or treaties with
each other or with foreign nations. They were merely dependen-
cies on the British Crown ; but the citizens of each Colony enjoyed
the full rights of British subjects in all the Colonies, and were at
liberty to move from one Colony to another, and to become inhabit-
ants and citizens thereof.

§ 2. The growth of the Colonies wasslow and gradual, running
along through a period of from one hundred to one hundred and

. ﬁfty years. The prerogatives of the Crown and the rights of the

people had not been clearly deﬁned on the one side, nor accepted on

States, and be settled and ‘formed into distinct republican States

to become members of the Federal Union.” .
§ 16. This resolution also suggested that the necessary and rea-

sonable expenses should be re—imbursed which any State had incurred
since the commencement of the Revolutionary War‘ in subduing any
British posts, or in maintaining forts or garrisons within the country
and for its defense, or in acquiring any part of the territory that
might be ceded or relinquished to the United States.

§ 17. In pursuance of these recommendations of Congress, New
York, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, South Carolina, North

Carolina, and Georgia made the desired surrender of their respec-

tive claims to the aforesaid vacant lands. New York took the lead
in the noble and generous sacriﬁce, March 1, 1781 ; and was fol-
lowed by the other States, one after another, at various dates, ending
with Georgia, April 24, 1802. »

§ 18. Since that time, our territory has been vastly extended by
the purchase of the Louisiana tract (1803) of France ; by the pur-
chase of Florida of Spain (1819) ; the annexation of Texas in 1845 ;
the addition of California, by treaty with Mexico, in 1848 ,- and by

‘the recent purchase of nearly ﬁve hundred thousand square miles of

Russian territory in North America. I ' '

§ 19. It was foreseen by the authors of the Constitution, that
this power to admit new States into the Union would soon become
necessary ; and it was accordingly vested in Congress. Under this

provision, the following States have already been admitted at the

I98 ANALYSIS or cIvIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

_1.— ELECTIONS.

§ 1. It is left with the Statesto ﬁx the times, places, and manner
of holding their ‘elections of senators and representatives in Con-

gress ; but, should they neglect to do this, Congress has jurisdiction *

over the whole subject, except as to the places of choosing senators.
Each State can consult its own local convenience with regard to
these elections; but it. has no right towholly neglect making the
necessary provisions for holding them. - . X

§ 2. Every government has the inherent right to provide for the
perpetuity of its own existence. « The Constitution could hardly contain

a a general election law applicable to the conveniences of all the States

alike. The power here given to Congress is simply discretionary,
not mandatory; and such a power must be vested somewhere. Judge
Story says, “ There were three ways in which it (this power) could

be reasonably organized. . It might be lodged either wholly in the.

National Legislature, or wholly in the State Legislatures; or.pri-

marily in the latter, and ultimately in the former.” The last mode

wasadopted by the Convention. _ , _ ..
§ 3. It is possible. that a State ‘might utterly.’ refuse to“ provide
for. the election of senators and representatives. One State under

- the Confederation actually did withdraw its members from Congress

to prevent the passage of important measures. What,Rhode Island

did then, another State might be disposed to repeat in substance, even’
if powerless to do it in the same manner. A.State can not now with-L

draw its members; but it might attempt to prevent their election,
and, but for the provision we are considering, might succeed in em-
barrassing‘ legislation. 7

_ §4. The places of choosing senators are left unalterably with
the legislatures of the several States. As the senators are chosen
by the legislatures of the several States, it is presumable that they
will hardly be likely to take any course to put themselves to unne-
cessary ineonvenience. Congress has provided for the election of
members of. the House of Representatives by Congressional districts;
and more recently they have exercised supervision to a- limited ex-
tent over the manner of electing senators.

Pram IL] Pownns on ooneanss. « 199

2.—-ELEICTORS or PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT.

-. § 5. The Stateshave the choosing of electors of President and
‘Vice-President; but Congress has the power to determine the time

when the electors shall be chosen. In 1792, March 1, Congress‘
passed an act requiring that the time for electing electors should be

within thirty-four days preceding the ﬁrst Wednesdays in Decembeii
of each year, when electors were to be appointed. Thus the ‘States

had a margin of over thirty days within which to hold their election"

of electors.
.§ 6. But Jan. 23, 1845, Congress passed an act specifying
the day on which electors should be elected throughout the United
States. That day is the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the
month of November of the year in which they are to be chosen.
.§ 7. The time when the electors are to give theirvotes for Presi-.
dent and Vice-President shall be the same throughout the United

S States. By act of Congress, that day is the first Wlednesday in
December after their election. The place is left for the _several '

State legislatures to designate; and they generally direct it to be
done at the State capitol. 7

§ 8. The provisions of Congress fixing a day for the election of
electors which shall be the same throughout the United States, as
well as the day on which the. electors shall give their votes, has a
tendency to prevent “ bargaining and selling,” and the formation of
political combinations to defeat the will of the people.

3. —ACTS, RECORDS, JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.

. § 9. When a judgmentis rendered by any State court in proper
form from which no appeal has been taken to any higher court within
the time allowed for appeals, that judgment is conclusive ever after,
between the parties to it, as to the matters in controversy. That
judgment will be received in evidence when offered in any other
court within the limits of the State within which it was rendered.

§ 10. But, before the ratiﬁcation of the Articles of Confederation,
there was no uniformity of practice in regard to this subject as be-

- tween the drgferent Colonies,-or as between the different States. In

the Articles of Confederation, there was a clause on the subject of the

200 Annnxsrs on iCIVIL- eovnnnmnnzr. [PARTIL

credit to be’-givenby one State to - the acts, records, &c., of other
States ; but no power was given to Congress to direct as to the
method of proof in such cases, and the effect thereof. i

1 § 11. The power to provide for the manner of proving the acts,
records, and judicial proceedings of the several States is vested in
Congress, though the faith and credit to be given between State and
State is mandatory in the Constitution. Under this power, Congress
l1‘a's‘pass’edi laws deﬁning the manner in which they shall be authen-
ticated, andthe effect to be given to their authenticity. '

.. § 12.‘ A judgment obtained in aicourt of competent jurisdiction
one State is valid in every other State in the Union. As between
nations foreign to each other, there is no uniform rule on the sub-
ject ; or, at most, a foreign judgment is only what the law calls
.'prz'mc’2-f‘acz'e evidence in the case, not conclusive. In other words,
the matter involved is re-examinable. . C *

§ 13. But,-. while the Constitution in another place requires that
full faith and credit shall be given in this matter as between the
States, endless embarrassment would ensue but for the exercise of
this legislative authority by Congress over the State courts.

§14. By act of May 26,- 1790, Congress provided the mode by
which records and judicial proceedings should be authenticated, and
declared that they should have such faith given to -them in every
court within the United States as they had by law or usage in the
courts of the State from whence the records were taken.

. . 4.—IMI’OSTS. AND ’DUTIES.
§ 15. In another_place, it will be seen that States are prohibited
from laying any imposts or duties on imports or exports without the
consent of Congress, except what may be necessary for the execution

of- their inspection-laws. If States should attempt to lay burden-

some inspection-duties, Congress has the power to pass acts of revis-
ion, and, in case it becomes necessary, to control the whole subject.
§.16. The subject of imposts and duties, we have seen, is exclu-
sively under the control of’ Congress ; and, should a State attempt
by some indirect method to lay duties or imposts, Congress has the
higher. right to control and revise its legislation. The State of

‘Maryland. passed a law in 1821, requiring all importers of goods,"

and other persons selling the same by Wholesale, to take out a
license costing fifty dollars. This was regarded as an_ indirect method
of laying State duties, and was decided by the Supreme Court of the

‘United States to be unconstitutional.

ART. XII.—¥EXECUTIVE VACANCY.’ L

1. May bylaw provtcle for the case of removal, cleath, resigna-
tion, or z'nabz'lt'ty both of P'rest'clent and Vice-President.
2. May by law declare what oﬁfcer shall then act as Presi-
dent, until,
1st. Such cltsctbtlity be removed,‘ or,
2ol. A Prestclent shall be elected. 5'7. .
§ 1. There was a strong feeling in the Constitutional Convention,
during its earlier labors, against the proposition to have a Vice-Pres-

‘ ident of the United States. Until this proposition found favor

among the members, the plan was that the President of the Senate
should Succeed the President of the United States in case, of the
death, resignation, or inability of the latter to perform the dutieslof
his office. But the Vice-Presidency Was ﬁnally accepted as a feature’
of the plan. ,    

§ 2. Congress, in the exercise of its power to provide for the va-
cancy of the executive chair by the death, removal, or inability of
both the President and Vice-President, has enacted that the Presi-

dent pro tempore of the Senate, and, in case there shall be no

President, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives, shall
act as President until the ‘disability be removed, or a President shall
be elected. , .
ART. XIII. —— APPOINTMENTS.
May by law vest the (appointment of T such inferior oﬁicers
as they shall thin/c p7~ope7",———-
1. In the Presiclent alone ,'
2. In the courts of law ; or,
3. In the heads of clepartments. $3.
§ 1. This power of vesting appointments, it will be observed, is
restricted to inferior officers. But Whatare inferior offices or oﬁié
cers? The Constitution does not discriminate. Such as Congress

202 ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

sees ﬁt to style inferior ofﬁcers need not the sanction of the Execu-
tive or the Senate to render their appointments valid. The heads
of departments, it is generally conceded, are not of this class.
They have the power over the appointments of the clerks in their

, respective ofﬁces. But there is great danger that a corrupt favor-

itism may be the result of the abuse of this power. I It has long
been used to punish and reward political opinion." To obtain an
office, a man’s political views must coincide with the appointing
power. _ This is a ﬂagrant abuse of official authority.

§ 2. The Postmaster-General wields a patronage, the estimate of
which is most fearful if dispensed as a political bribe throughout

the country. The question is too seldom asked, whether the appli- I

cant for a village post—off1ce is honest, capable,_and faithful to the
Constitution; but, on the contrary, his ﬁtness for office, in thou-
sands of instances, is tested by his ﬁdelity to party. So extensive

' has been the practice of distributing oﬁicial favors to political parti-

sans during the last thirty years, that, with rare exceptions, a man’s
political sentiments could be inferred by the ofﬁce he held. Public
offices ought not to be distributed as rewards for political opinions.

ART. XIV.—CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.

1.. Shall propose amendments to the Constitution whenever"

two-thirds of both houses of Congress shall deem it
necessary ,° or, .
2. On application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the sev-
eral States, Congress shall call a convention for propos-
e ing amendments. s
3. May prescribe either of two modes of ratifying the pro-
posed ame_ndments.
1st. By State conventions ,° or,
2d. By the State legislatures. 78.
§ 1. Congress has no power to alter or amend the Constitution ;
but they can take the initiatory steps. They can submit proposi-
tions to the States for this purpose, ‘whenever, in the estimation of

.two-thirds of the members of both houses, amendments become ne-

cessary.

of the United States Was but an experiment, which, in its original
form, might not prove successful. Itwas Wise, therefore, to make
provisions in the instrument itself for its amendment. A Constitu-
tion suited to the necessities of this generation may not be adapted to
the wantsof the next. But it was Well to guard against, the hasty
adoption of amendments, without allowing suﬁcient experience under
the original instrument to test the utility of its provisions. The
powers of Congress over this subject are quite limited. The prop-
osition for amendments may originate with Congress, or with the
legislatures of two-thirds of the several States. When it originates
with the States, instead of amenldrnents being proposed by Congrepss,
that body calls a convention to propose them. .

§ 3. Congress has the power of directing whether the proposed
amendments (whatever way they originate) shall be ratiﬁed by

State conventions or by State legislatures. Thus far, there have -

been adopted fourteen Articles, of Amendments. These have all ori-
ginated with Congress, and have been ratiﬁed by State legislatures."
There is one clause of the Constitution unamendable except by the
consent of the State interested, which reads thus: “ No State, with’-
out its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Sen-
ate.”. This is for the protection of the smaller Statesin» the national
councils.

As Congress takes. no part in the rat-zﬁﬁcation of proposed amend-
ments, that subject belongs in another place. (See Chap. IX.,
Art._I., Part II.) A 1

gress hacl the power to impose a tam orrluti , not ea;eeecl-

1.—ITS ABOLITION.

_ _ § 1. The,_Constitutio_n as it came from the hands of its authors in
1787, and as it was ratiﬁed by the people of the several States, rec-

’ ognized slavery as a State institution. True, the word “ slave,” or

204 I ‘ANALYSIS on CLVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

‘‘ slavery,” is not in the instrument, - These words were carefully and
intentionally omitted. A In the thirteenth. Articleof Amendments, the
word “slavery” appears for the first time in the Constitution ; and
that articl-e abolishes the institution throughout the United States
and their territories. ~

§ 2. Section second of the thirteenth Article of Amendments
gives Congress legislative authority over the subject. As four or
ﬁve millions of men, women, and children, were suddenly transferred
from slavery to freedom, it was presumed that national legislation
would become necessary to protect them in their new condition.
Congress has already exercised this power in the passage of several
statutes on the subject. This matterwill receive further attention
in considering State prohibitions.

2.—-FOREIGN SLAVE-TRADE. A
§3. The provision of the Constitution relating to this subject
‘reads as follows : —.—-T - ~
_“ The migration or importation of such persons as any of - the
States now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be ‘pro-
hibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hun-
dred and eight ; but a tax or duty may be imposed on such A impor-
tation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.” ,
At the time of the formation of the Constitution, all the States
held slaves, except one; and the foreign slave-trade was lawful
among all n_ations of the world. , , 7 A
§ 4. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution, the general
opinion prevailed that slavery would gradually diminish until it would
become extinct in all the States. This opi_nion was based, on the
supposition that free labor would ultimately be found to be more
proﬁtable than slave labor, and that slaves would «soon, become val-
ueless. At that time,_it must be remembered, cotton was not the
leading article of commerce which it has become during the present
century. V A _
§ 5. At that time, the processes of separating the seed from the
cotton, spinning the cotton into yarn, and weaving the yarn into
‘cloth, were so slow and clumsy compared withthe methods of doing

rm IL] rownas on CONGRESS. . 205

thesame ‘things at the present day, that this article did not promise
to become a leading fabric with which to clothe the world. - But lit-
tle cotton was Worn, and that little was eixpensiveg. A vast expendi-
ture of . labor was required to convert it from the raw material into
cloth. V
§ 6. But, near the close of the last century, three inventions, each
contributing to the same end, produced awonderful revolution ‘in the

‘ mechanical processes of converting cotton into cloth. The cotton—gin

by Eli VVhitney of Connecticut, the spinning-jenny by Sir Richard
Arkwright, and the power-loom by Edmund Cartwright, both of

' England, have accomplished this great change. By means of these

inventions, the products of human industry in the manufacture of
cotton goods have been multiplied more than a hundred-fold. -

§ 7. The facilities for the manufacture of cotton goods being thus
multiplied, the goods were greatly reduced in price, the call for them
in the markets of the World Was proportionally extended, and, of

course, the demand for the raw material Wascorrespondingly in‘-'
_creased. This demand increased the call for slave-lalwgor, this call

enhanced the price of slaves, and all combined advanced the slave-
holding interests of the South. Of course, all these changes were
unforeseen by the authors of the Constitution.

§  Congress passed a law prohibiting the foreign slave~trade
after the first day of January, 1808 ; imposing mild penalties of ﬁne
and imprisonment for its breach. But the slave-trade had become
proﬁtable, and the law was frequently disobeycd. In 1820, Con-
gress passed a law making the foreign slave-tradepiracy, punishable
by death. In 1865, "slavery Was abolished by a Constitutional
‘amendment, as has been stated.

the other. During the latter part of- this period, therefore, the
relative rights of sovereign and subject became a matter of serious
and earnest contention.

§3. The Colonial Legislatures claimed entire and exclusive
authority in -all matters ‘relating to their own domestic’ and internal
affairs. They denied all power of taxation, except under laws
passed by themselves; not admitting that even the British Parlia-
ment and Crown combined had any such power. P They insisted
that a free people could not be taxed without their consent in
person, or through their accredited representatives.

§4. On the other hand, the British Parliament, by express
declaration, claimed that the Colonies and Plantations in America
have been, are,‘and of right ought to be, subordinate unto, and
dependent upon, the imperial Crown and Parliament of Great

‘Britain; that the king, with the advice and consent of Parliament,

“had, hath, and of right ought to have, full power‘ and authority to
makeilaws and statutes of suﬁicient force and validity to bind the
Colonies and people of America in all cases whatsoever.” H

§ 5. The theory that Great Britain had the right to tax the Colo-

nies, together with the attempt to carry that doctrine into practice ‘

on the part of the Crown and Parliament, and its denial on the part
of the Col_onies, united with the determination on their part to carry
that denial to open, practical resistance, led to ﬁnal separation from
all connection with Great Britain.

§ 6. Hoping to prevent this result-, Parliament passed an act
intended to conciliate the Colonies, which declared that “ Parliament
would not impose any duty or tax’ on the Colonies, except for the
regulation of commerce 3 and that the net produce of such duty or
tax should be applied to the use of the Colony in which it was
levied.” But this did not satisfy the disaffected colonists. They

claimed to be sole judges of what should be done, even for their own ‘

good. V
§ 7. The spirit of liberty was thus aroused ; and a sense of future
danger inspired them to take‘ the onward steps that ﬁnally led to the

. Declaration of Independence on the fourth day of July, 1776.
‘ 2

206 ANALYSIS.OF»CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PAmqII. > r

1 §»1.. This general power‘ to make ‘laws,,a.ble' commentators‘ say,
is merely a speciﬁcation of what would have been implied even had
this provision of the Constitution been omitted ; for the granting
of any power implies consent on the part of the grantor, that the
necessary means may be adopted to render that power eifective.
This reasoning, however, does not prove that this provision is mere
surpliisage; for there were several powers granted in the Articles of
Confederation, which, for want of others to render them effective,
were but a mockery .

§ 2 As it is impossible to specify in the fundamental law of a
nation all the powers which at some time it may be indispensably
necessary to exercise for the common good, this provision seems to
be among the wisest to be found in the Constitution. Had the
attempt, been made_ to enumerate afﬁrmatively all laws necessary and
proper which Congress might pass, it must have resulted in failure

dissolve the two houses of Parliament : ‘he can call them to-
gether at any time he sees ﬁt. So the President of the United States
can convene either or both-houses of Congress on extraordinary occa-
sions. But, if it should so happen that the President wasessentially
at variance with Congress, had he the power to prevent their meet-

agree in reference to thetime of assembling. By this provision, if »,

they can not agree on any other time, they must meet the ﬁrst Mon-

probablyfor two -reasons: ﬁrst, the seat of the National Govern-»

ment had not been established at the time when the Constitution was
formed ; and, second, war or pestilence might at times interfere With‘
the meeting at any place that -might be named in the Constitution.

§ 1. A bill, as here used, is the draught of a proposed law. It
may be introduced by any one of ‘severalimethods. '
1st. It may be introduced, with theleave of the house, by any
member.‘ . l _ .
2d. It may be introduced by order of either house ;
3d. Cn-the report of a committee ; or, . ‘ e _ . .
4th._ It may be introduced by the report of .a standing or select
committee. ..
§ 2. A standing committee is one that is appointed to continue
during the session or term of the body from Which it is ehosen.. To
this committee is usuallyreferred all that class of subjects which
appropriately comeswithin its jurisdiction. Its name is usually
suggestive of its business ; as the Committee on Agriculture, Commit-
tee on Finance, Committee on Military Aﬁ°airs, Committee of Ways and
Means, Judiciary Committee ,° and so on. A subject may be present-
ed, l1oWever—,that does not appropriately belong to any standing
committee. Such matter is usually referred to a committee appoint-

tn. be-onto:-—t

ed expressly for this purpose, which is called a select committee. All

deliberative and legislative bodies have their committees usually.

appointed by the presiding officer ; though theyare not always so

appointed : it is sometimes done by the assembly.
§ 8. A bill in Congress must receive three several readings before
it is put upon its ﬁnal passage. N 0 bill can be read more than once

on the same day without the special perm_ission of the house. The

vote is taken on its third reading. The arguments for and. against
the bill, if any, are made before its third reading, or between its
third reading and the taking of the vote. If the bill passes, it.,i_-S
signed by the presiding officer, and sent to the other house. If it

PART II.] PROCESS on LAW-MAKING.   209

passes the other house, the presiding-‘ofﬁcer of that house_ signs it;
after Which, it is sent to the President of the United States for his
approval or disapproval. '

§ 4. At any time duringnthe pendency of a hill, amendments to
it m-ay be proposed, and passed by either house. Either house may
concur in or reject the amendments made to a bill by the other, or
may reject the bill altogether. But, at any stage of "the proceed-
ings, amendments being attached to a bill in one house must be sent
to the other for approval or disapproval. The President has no
‘powerto attach "amendments. T

§ 5. The ﬁrst process of law-making, as described in the Analysis,
is the simplest; only requiring that a bill shall pass both houses of
Congress, and receive the signature of the President. In such
cases, only a numerical m_ajority of each house is necessary. The
bill may pass either or both houses Without the formality of taking
the yeas and nays, unless they shall be called for by one-ﬁfth of the
members present. ’ i ’

§ 6. The second process of law-making is the one in which the

President’s veto as it is commonl called, is inter aoscd. To become ‘
7 _

a law inopposition to the President’s objections, more formality is
required. than in the first process of law-making ; and, instead of
merely a numerical majority of each house, it requires a two-third
majority, after his veto, to pass the. bill. The voting must be done in
the second process by yeas and nays, even though one-ﬁfth of the
members do not call for them; and the names of persons voting
for and against the bill must be recorded. These requirements are

not matters of legislative discretion, but of Constitutional provision, .

and therefore imperative. . - . «
§ 7. The word veto is borrowed from_ the Latin language, and
signiﬁes, I forbid. «>,The President’s negative on the bills. passed

by Congress is called his veto. As we have already seen, his

veto is qualiﬁed, not absolute. The sovereign of Great Britain has

an absolute negative on the bills of Parliament, though he has not

exercised it for nearly two hundred years.
§ 8. There was an earnest effort in the Constitutional Convention,

on the part of - some of the leading members, to vest in the Executive
.. 1‘ _

210 ANALYSIS on C_IVIL_GrOVERNMENT. [PART II.

an unqualiﬁed negative," or veto, on all bills passed» by Congress.
Some of themost illustrious names in that illustrious body gave up
this proposition with great reluctance. But for Dr. Franl:lin’s op-
position, ‘perhaps it Would have been carried. _ He said he had had
some experience of this check on the_Executive in the legislature of
Pennsylvania. The negative of the governor was constantly -made
usedof to extort money. . No good law whatever could_ be passed

Without a private bargain with him. .
§ 9. An increase of his salary, or some donation, was always made
a condition ; till at last it became the regular practice to have .orders
in his favor, on the treasury, presented along with the bills to be
signed", so that he might actually receive the former before he should
sign the latter.’ It was held by the opponents of the absolute nega-
tive to be dangerous in the extreme to allow one man to check the
will of. the whole. N 0 one man could be found so far above all the
rest in wisdom as to render it safe to clothe him with. such august
power. The Constitutional provision as it now stands passed the
Convention by the vote of eight States against two, ———afterwards
unanimously. C V V ' _ 
A § 10. This executive power, on the other liand, may operate as a

salutary check on hasty legislation. Factions, precipitate, and even

unconstitutional legislation, arising from temporary excitement and
party zeal, might disgrace the halls of Congress. The Executive, not
having participated in the rivalry of debate, and being quietly
retired from the scenes of political strife, may be presumed to be
better qualiﬁed to pronounce correct judgment than those who were
active in the contest. _ ‘

§g1p1. The third process of law-making differs from theﬁrst and
second «only with regard to the action, or _ rather inaction, of the
President. He simply neglects to sign the bill within ten days,
Sundays excepted, after receiving it. In such case, it becomes a
law if Congress remains in session during that period; but, if

Congress adjourns before the expiration of that time, the law is

defeated. This last provision isfor the purpose of taking it out of

p the power of Congress to give validity. to their acts merely by

adjournment.

Were it not for this provision, Congress might exert their power

in the form of orders, resolutions, or votes; thus preventing the

President from interposing his veto. They could thus substantially
legislate in these forms Without the sanction of the Executive, and
without the necessity of a two-third majority of each house. A As it
nowstands, the President has the same power of disapproval of an
order, resolution, or vote, that he has to negative, an act passed in
the ordinary forms of legislation; and, if he disapproves them by
the interposition of his veto, they must be re-passed by the yeas and

-nays, and by the same formalities as requiredin the second process

for the passage of a bill.

§ 2. It sometimes happens-in the- administration of -law and gov-
ernment that a person is wrongfully imprisoned, or restrained of his
liberty, before trial and ﬁnal sentence by a court of competent juris-
diction. Sometimes, also, persons maybe wrongfully restrai1_1ed of
their liberty without even so much as the forms of law ; as by im-
properly holding a child in custody, or locking a person in aroom.
More usually, however, it is. done by ad perversion of the forms of
law. V _ I .

§. 3. The remedy in such cases is by a writ of habeas corpus,- as
itis called ; taking its name from the command -in the writ to pro_—
duce the body of some person named therein, who, it is alleged, is
illegally restrained of his liberty. Habeas corpus signiﬁes, “have
you the bod;/.”r The proceedings in such cases are substantially in
this manner : —-.- . _ . _

For instance, VVilliam Jackson is imprisoned in Monroe-county
jail, New York. , . . . . ‘ . . . .
1st. He, or some person in. his behalf, makes affidavit that he is

wrongfully restrained of his liberty in the jail aforesaid by
some person, say John. Brown, the jailer. , .
2d.’ This afﬁdavit is made before a court of competent jurisdiction,
T J J i and a writ of habeas corpus is asked of the court. , J T
3d. The writ is issued, of course, commanding John Brown to
bring the body of VVilliam' Jackson before the court on a day
mentioned in the writ, and to make return on the writ why
he, Brown, holds Jackson in custody or under restraint. .
4th. The writ is served by some competent eﬂicer by reading it to
,~ Brown, and giving him acertiﬁed copy if requested.
5th. On the day named in thewrit for its return, Brown appearsin
court with J ackson,_ and Brown shows the court by_d_0.011‘

Jackson. _ ‘

The productions of some of the States are very diﬁerent from those.‘

dens of taxation would be very unequal. The staple production of .
some States, is - cotton ; of others, rice ; of others, tobacco 3 of

others, sugar ; and of others, articles of manufacture which are used
chieﬂy for home consumption. Some States are interested in . the

for ‘until Congress shall have passed upon thevalidity of the. claim,’
and ordered an appropriation. Thewhole mattter is subject to the

critical review and decision of Congressi The object of this provis-'

ion is to secure strict faithfulness in the public expenditures‘. Neither
the executive, nor the judiciary, nor the heads of ‘departments, nor
the ofﬁcers of the army or navy, nor even members "of Congress
themselves, can draw a dollar of the public money except by appro-‘
priations made by law. ‘ -

§ 2. The requirement that a. regular account and statement of the
receipts and expenditures of the public ‘money shall be published
from time to time puts a most salutary check on the ‘possible pro-
fusion and ‘extravagance of the National Legislature. The people
have the right to know how, and for what purposes, their money is
expended. The heads of the departments must make an "annual
exhibit of their transactions respectively. p‘ ‘

§ 3. The fear that the army might possibly become a ‘power too
formidable _to ‘be consistent with the rights and libertiesiof the
people led to this Constitutional limitation of army approp1'iations.
It is necessary toraise and support armies even in time of peace ;
but not a dollar can be appropriated for this purpose without the
sanction of ‘Congress. And, lest Congress may be extravagant in
this direction, they are-forbidden to make appropriations extending
beyond the period of two years. A Congress lasts for but two
years ; and, should they be profuse in their appropriations of army
money, the people will be likely to correct the error in their election
of the succeeding Congress. T T C ’ '

CHAPTER .VI.
UNITY on THE COLONIES.

§ 1. ALTHOUGH the Colonies were not at any time united in any
sense as a nation, they sometimes found it of advantage .to unite
temporarily for the common defense against the Indian tribes, as
Well as the Dutch; and also in 1754, for the purpose of defending
themselves in case of war with France, which a.t that time seemed

imminent. '

§ 2. These experiences had taught them that there was safety as
Well as strength in union. Therefore, when England gave evidence
of a determination to oppress the Colonies, they did not hesitate to
unite in vindication of their common interests.

I § 3. A Congress, at the call of Massachusetts, assembled in
Philadelphia Sept. 5, 1774, consisting of delegates from all the
Colonies. his is known in history as the “First Continental Con-
gress." It was the ﬁrst in which all the Colonies were represented.

§ 4. This Congress published to the world a. long and emphatic
bill of rights, which may be regarded as the ﬁrst decided step
towards independence. It was clear to every reflecting mind, that,
if that declaration of rights were accepted by the people, either
England must take a speedy backward step, or the declaration of
separation and independence was just at hand.

§ 5. The Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia
May 10, 1775. This Congress continued in session until the close
of the Revolutionary ‘Var, and until a deﬁnite form of government
was adopted. It passed the Declaration of Independence, in which,
for the ﬁrst time, the Colonies received the name of ‘United States
of America, —a title which has been continued ever since.

§ 1. A bill of attainder, which is here forbidden, is a phrase
borrowed from England. It is a special act‘ of the legislative body,
inflicting capital punishment on a person for high crimes, Without
having been ﬁrst convicted before a judicial tribunal. A person
against Whom such an act is passed is rendered infamous, and is
said to be attainted, or stained and disgraced. The person" so
attainted forfeited all his property, real and personal, to the Crown ,-
and, by operation of law, his blood became so corrupted, that he
could neither inherit any thing from his ancestry, nor. transmit by
hereditary descent to his heirs, lineal or collateral.

~§ 2. An act of the legislature convicting a person ‘of any crime,
and inﬂieting any punishment short of death, is called a bill of pains
and penalties.

The Constitution of the United States humanely forbids the pas-
sage of any bill of attainder. ~

§ 3. An ex post facto law is one that is retro-active, orwhich

makes an act criminal which was not so when committed. It has
to do entirely with past transactions, and of a criminal nature. The
Supreme Court of the United States has deﬁned an ex‘ post facto
law to be one “‘vvhich*renders, an act punishable in" a manner in

which it was not punishable when it was committed.” For'i‘nstanc‘e‘,“

from 1808 to 1820, the foreign -slave-trade was punishable by fine‘
and imprisonment. e a After 1820,, it was punishable by death. Had

the law, of 1820 punished the infractions of the law which were .

PART IL] 1>;aoH1B1r1o1\*s ON THE. U. s; 217

committed in 1813 with death, it would have been an ear: post facto
law. Laws Which mitigate the punishment, however, are not regard

;— ed as ex postfacto ; for they are in favor of the accused.

. § 4. It would be grossly and manifestly unjust, as Well as unpar-
donably cruel, to visit a crime with a severer penalty than ‘Was
attached to it at the time of C its commission ; yet laws of this kind
have been passed in some of the European" States. _ .

§ 5. Treason is deﬁned by the Constitution, ‘and’ its punishment
is left with Congress to provide for; ‘but, Whatever penalty may be
attached to this crime, “no attainder‘ of treason shall Work corrup-'
tion of ‘blood, or ‘forfeiture, except during the life of the person
attainted.” The crime of treason in England——that country from

T Which We have largely borrowed many features of our institutions--
was punishable by death in the most horrid and revolting forms. ‘

Notionly so, butthe c’ri1ninal’s' blood "became so corrupted by fiction
of ‘law, that all powers of transmission were destroyed. His lineal
and collateral kindred were compelled to suffer for his ‘offenses.

§ 6. Our Constitution is more consonant with justice and human-
ity, in that it takes it out of the power of Congress to punish the
innocent for the crimes of the ‘guilty. In afﬁrmance of this Consti-
tutional . provision forbidding the Working of corruption of blood
and of ' forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted,
Congress has by law declared that “ no conviction or judgment for
any capital or other offenses shall Work corruption of blo‘od,lo“r any

V forfeiture of estate.”

§ 1. Slavery has existed in every age of the vs?orltl,'n‘ot merely

among the barbarous and savage nations, ‘but"‘“an1ong the most i_

reﬁned, civilized, and even-"Christian nations. ' Captives in War were

sold as slaves, and were regarded and treated as property. This

death. If the captor saved the ca.ptive’s life, this was viewed as a

mercy to the prisoner; for which he was to be reduced to perpetual
servitude. V I I
I § 2. It was but a slight remove from slavery to the slave-trade.
The strong and powerful soon came to regard it’ as their right to
prey on the weak and defenseless. Among the ancients, slavery

ﬁnall became ‘a regular branch of commerce. Even in modern
. C’)

times and between Christian nations, treaties have been formed for
the purpose of facilitating commerce in this species of property.

§ 3. But, towards the close of the eighteenth century, the slave-
trade began to excite a spirit of disapprobation ; and the conviction
fastened itself on the consciences of men, that this traiﬁc in human
beings was repugnant to the principles, of Christian obligation.
Many of the great and good men who formed the Constitution of
the United States shared in this conviction. In that Convention,
the foundation was laid to put a ﬁnal stop to this outrage on the
rights of humanity, by vesting in Congress the power to prohibit
the traﬁic by citizens of the United States after 1807. Although
the provision is expressed in negative terms, that Congress shall not

prohibit the practice prior to t/zatﬁmc, yet, in legal parlance, it has

all the effect of an affirmation that Congress may prohibit it after
that time.

§ 4. Before the Declaration of Independence, as early as August,
1774, Virginia and North Carolina had resolvedby their legislative
assemblies to discontinue the importation, of slaves. The ﬁrst Con-_
tinent-al Congress passed a similar resolution, which was to take effect
from and after the ﬁrst day of December’ of the same year.

§_5. After the adoption of the Constitution, March 22, 1794, and
May 10, 1800, acts were passed by Congress prohibiting-the citizens
of the United ‘States, and residents within them, from engaging‘ in
the transportationi of slaves ‘from the United -States to any foreign
place or country, or from one foreign place or country’ to another,
for the purposes of traffic. It will be observed that these acts pro-
hibited our citizens from all participation in the foreign slave-trade
except by direct z'mp0rtat7.'0n into the United States. Thus Con,-
gress did all they possibly could under the Constitution at that time
to inte1°dict.this inhuman traffic.-

PART IL] PROHIBITIONS on THE U. s. a 219*

' § 6. By‘ act of March’2, 1807, Congress prohibited, -under severe
penalties, the importation of slaves into the United States from and
after Jan. 1, 1808. By another act, passed April 20, 1818, the
penalties of the act of March 2, 1807, were increased in severity."
Another act was passed March 3, 1819, authorizing national armed
vessels to be sent to the coast of Africa to prevent citizens or resi~
dents of the United States from engaging in the slave—trade. This
act authorized the seizure and conﬁscation of any vessels found

engaged in this business. Another ‘act of Congress, passed May.

15, 1820, made the foreign slave-trade piracy, and punishable by
death. - ‘ _

§ 7. The reader should bear in mind that these various acts of
Congress have nothing to do with the slave-trade as between the
several States. That matter was regulated ‘by the States themselves,
and some of them passed laws on this subject. They did this be-
fore the ﬁnal abolition of slavery, which was done by amendment
of the Constitution of the United States in 1865.

§ 8. A few words may not be out of place here in reference to
the progress of other nations on this subject. The following facts
are gathered from one of the lectures of the late Chancellor Kent
on the law of nations. The ﬁrst British statute that declares the
slave-trade unlawful was passed in March, 1807. This was a great
triumph of British justice. Afterwards, by act of ‘Parliament,
March 31, 1824, the slave-trade was declared to be piracy. _

§ 9. Almost every maritime nation in Europe has deliberately
and solemnly, either by legislative acts or by treaties and other for-
mal engagements, acknowledged the injustice and inhumanity of the
trade, and pledged itself to promote its abolition. 1. ' ' .

§ 10. By treaty between Great Britain and France, May 30,
1814, Louis XVIII. agreed that the trafﬁc was repugnant to the
principles of natural justice; and he engaged to add his efforts at

the ensuing Congress to induce all the powers of Christendom to"

decree the abolition of the trade, andthat,‘on the part of the French
Government, it should deﬁnitely cease in the course of ﬁve years.

’ .§ 11. The ministers of the eightprincipal European powers-who;

, nations of Christendom on the subject.

face of Europe and the world, that the African slave-trade had
been regarded by just and enlightened men in all ages as repugnant
to the principles of humanity and of ‘universal morality ;_that the

public voice in all civilized countries demanded that it should be-

suppressed; and thatthe universal abolition of it was conformable
to the spirit of the age and the generous principles of the allied
powers. ' InlMarch, 1815, tl1e_Ernperor Napoleon decreed that the
slave-trade should be abolished; and in July of the same year,
after Napoleon’s downfall, Louis XVIII. gave directions that this
odious and wicked traffic should from that time cease. A no

§ 12. Denmark, in 1792, abolished the foreign slave-_trade, and
the importation of slaves into her colonies, to take effect in 1804.
In December, 1817, Spain prohibited the purchase of slaves on any
part of the coast of Africa after May 31, 1820. In January,-

1818, Portugal made the like prohibition as to the purchase of 4

slaves on any part of the coast of Africa north of the equator.

§ 13. In 1821, there was not a ﬂag of any European State
which could legally cover this trafﬁc to the north of the equator;
and yet, in 1825, the importation of slaves covertly continued, if it
was not openly countenanced, from the Rio de la Plata to the Ama-
zon, and through the whole American archipelago.
e § 14. By a convention between England and Brazil in 1826, it
was made piratical for the subjects of Brazil to be engaged in the

slave-trade after the year 1830. In the treaty of ‘Sept. 10, 1822,.

between Great Britain and the Imaun of Muscat, the latter agreed
to abolish the slave-trade for ever in his dominions. By the treaty
of the 23d of October, 1817,.between Great Britain and the
King of Madagascar, it was agreed that there should be throughout
the dominionsiof the latter an entire cessation of the sale or trans-
ferof slaves. . " ' I

tion of the UnitediStates, which should forbid the ‘importation of
slaves before 1808, was one of the results of a compromise of this
wholematter of slavery. It was feared by those States that had a
large commercial interest in the foreign slave-trade, that, although
Congress was forbidden to intermeddle with the subject before 1808,
some amendment to the Constitution might be adopted to their preju-
dice unlessforbidden. To _allay that fear, this prohibition was in-

fere with them. But one of these rights, that relating to a religious

specified in that document. These proposed amendments were com-

article. » . . r p _

§ 3. Some of these ‘amendments are negative in form, and others

afﬁrmative. Those under consideration are such as relate to the

individual rights of the citizen, civil and religious, with which the
government is forbidden to interfere. They are prohibitions on
the United States, relating to personal freedom. , _ a

§ 4. Freedom of 4 speeck, with which Congress is prohibited from
interfering, does not mean to shield the citizen from legal responsi-
bility for what he may utter. True, a man may say What he
pleases; but heis responsible for the abuse of this liberty. He has
no. right to slander the reputation of another. Private reputation is

' a subject of protection by the laws of the land. You may slander

a manin various Ways, notwithstandping this liberty of speech. If
you charge him with the commission of a crime which is indictable,
‘and which would subject him, if true, to infamous punishment, this

is slander. Charging a man with a breach of public trust is slan- I

der. ’ A man can be slandered in reference to his trade or business
by declaring him to be incompetent, or by saying of a merchant, for
instance, that he is in failing circumstances, when he is not.

§ 5. A slander becomes a libel when communicated by pictures
or signs, or Writing, printing, or painting. It is then calculated to
make a deeper impression, may have a wider circulation, and is the

more aggravating, because it may be presumed to bedone with full E

deliberation. A matter may be libelous if _ Written or printed,
Which, legally, would not be slanderous if spoken. Expressions
‘Which hold a man up to ridicule, or tend to degrade him in the
‘esteem or society, are libelous if Written or printed. Freedom of

Writer may publish What he pleases; but, if he publishes that which
is mischievous or illegal, he is responsible for the publication.

' §7. The right of the people to meet iiitpeaeeable assemblage,
and to petition the government for a redress of grievances, shall not
be infringed. p In despotic governments, the people are sometimes
denied this right, under the pretense that the assemblies are con-
spiring against the Welfare of the government, and are insurrection-
ary and riotous in their aims. It is the inestimable birthright of
every American citizen to petition the government against the inﬂic-A
tion of wrong and injustice. V .

§ 8. The right of the people to keep and bear arms, with which
the General Government is herein prohibited from interfering, refers
to an organization of the militia of the States. There have been
fears expressed, that the liberty of the people might be destroyed,
by the perverted power of a formidable standing army. , But here
is. the check to any such danger. The militia, that might be called,

‘ out at any time on a month’s. notice, would outnumber,.twent.y to

one, any standing army in time of peace that will ever be tolerated
in the United States. Large standing armies might indeed be dan-
gerous in a republican government,’ but for a much stronger. force
distributed throughout the ranksof the people. _

,§_9. A _man’s religious viewsliare not to be questioned w_hen_
appointed or elected to any ofﬁce under the Government of_the_
United States. This, it must be remembered, does not apply to
State ofﬁcers. In some of the States, religious tests have been
applied ; but the Constitution of the United States wisely prohibits
inquiry i_nto the religious sentiments of any man, preliminary to his
induction into office. We1*e it otherwise, the political Would soon be
merged in the ecclesiastical questions of the day ; and, ultimately,

occurs in the Constitution. It was introduced for the purpose of
effectually silencing all attempts at an alliance of Church and State
in the National Government. -

§ 10. In the very first Article of Amendments to the Constitution,

C())1(r1'esS is prohibited from making any law respecting an establish-:
D .

ment of religion, or from interfering with its free exercise. _Con-
grass is not allowed in any way to intermeddle with the religious
institutions of the country.- Our -fathers felt extreme dread of
every thing in the line of religious establishments of State._ They
felt that religion was chieﬂy a matter of personal concern between
the individual and his Maker. They were familiar with the history
of religious intolerance in those European States where the ecclesi-
astical’ power had become superior to the civil. They were well
satisﬁed that the interests of a pure and holy religion demand no

‘alliance with the civil power. Many of the authors of the Consti-

tution were themselves menof strong religious convictions; so that
we are not to attribute the clauses on this subject, either in the Con-
stitution or its amendments, as arising from indifI’e1‘encie or hostility
to the interests of religion. '.

§ 11. Judge Story says, “ It was also obvious, from the numer-
ous and powerful sects existing in the United States, that there
would be perpetual temptations to struggles for ascendency in the
national councils, if any one might thereby hope to found a perma-

nent and exclusive national establishment of its own ; and religious

persecutions might thus be introduced to an extent utterly subver-
sive of the ‘true interests and good order of the Republic. The most

effectual mode of suppressing the evil, in the View of the people, 4

Was to strike down the temptation to its introduction.”

time, as a committee was appointed on that day to draft such a
document to be reported to Congress. This step rendered it more

than ever necessary that some plan of union between the Colonies V

should be adopted. Another committee was therefore appointed to
prepare Articles of Confederation, which should bring the Colonies
into a closer and more deﬁnite union.

§2. This committee reported a plan of confederation _July 12
following, just eight days after the adoption of the Declaration of
Independence. This document consisted of "twenty articles as it
came from the hands of the committee. , It was discussed at various
times in Congress, running through a period of some sixteen months,
subjected to various amendments, consolidated into thirteen articles,
and ﬁnally adopted by Congress Nov. 15, 1777.

§ 3. The Articles of Confederation were immediately sent to all
the. States, with the Congressional recommendation for their approval
and adoption. The new government constituted by these Articles
was not to go into operation until the consent of all the States
should be obtained.

§4. In July, 1778, the ratiﬁcation of all the States was ob«
tained, except Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland. The assent
of New Jersey was given Nov. 25 of the same year; of
Delaware, Feb. 22, 1779; and of Maryland, March 1, 1781.
On the second day of March, 1781, Congress assembled under
the Confederation.

§ 5. But the Revolutionary War, which began in 1775, had con-
tinued all this time; during which the States had been united by
the ties of a common interest, by the sense of a common danger,
and by the necessities of a common cause, having no written bond
of union. In short, they were held together by their fears.

. § 1. The object of the foregoing provision, which excludes per-
sons Who hold any office under the General Government from being
appointed electors of President and Vice-President of the United
States, was to prevent combinations and intrigues between pre-exist-
ing ofﬁcials and the candidates for the two highest oiﬁces in the gift
of the people. This clause requires that the electors shall come
direct and fresh from the people, untrammeled by existing ofﬁcial
relations. .

'§ 2. The clause forbidding membership of either house to officers
under the General Government has been noticed in treating of the
eligibility of senators and representatives, and need not be discussed
here. ‘ -
§3. Senators and representatives, although not ofﬁcers of the
United States, are excluded from being electors of President and
Vice-President. The same reasons, however, why United-States

. ofﬁcers should not be electors, bear with increased force against

members of Congress assuming that trust. (See Executive Depart-
ment.) e i

§ 4. The Constitution forbids the appointment of members of
Congress to any civilioﬂices created, or the emoluments whereof have
been increased, during the terms forwhich such members were elect-
‘ed. _ The object of these provisions is apparent.‘ o It is to forbid the

§ 1. According to the theory of our government, American citi- '

The chief purpose of this clause istoiforbid the acceptance of these

ment, might seduce him from the faithful discharge I of duty to his
own country. _ I A

_ § 2. A private citizen, it Will be -observed, does not come under
this prohibition; nor does an officer under any State government.
It is, perhaps, to be regretted that this prohibition was not extended
farther, so as to include all American citizens. ‘Were a costly pres-
ent to be made by the Emperor of France or the Queen of England
to the President of the United States, he would not be at-liberty to
accept it on his ovvn account, though hemight in behalf - of the

CHAPTER VIII.

RIGHTS OF STATES.

ARTICLE I. -- REPRESENTATION.

 Each State shall have at least one representative. 5.‘

 No amendment shall be made to the Constitution depriv-

" ling any State, without its consent, of its egual sufrage
in the Senate. '?8. ,

S § 1. The ﬁrst paragraph of this article is one of the clauses" of’

theiﬁfth pa_1'agraph of the Constitution, as it is numbered for con:
-venience. of reference. Witli the clause with which it standsiin

connection, it reads thus: “The number of representatives shall
not exceed one for every thirty thousand ; but each State shall have
at least onerepresentative.” It is not here declared that there shall
be one representative for every thirty thousand, but that the ‘pro-

portion shall not exceed -that.

§ 2. At the taking of the first census, in 1790, it vvasaascertained

that the State having theleast number of inhabitants, Delavvare,

PART IL] RIGHTS on STATES}; 229

contained over ﬁfty-nine -thousand. In 1860, the population of that

State‘ was a little over a hundred and twelve thousand ; notienough,

however, to give it one representative, were it not for this clause,
which says that “ each State shallhave at least one representative ;”
for in 1860 the ratio of representation was ﬁxed at one member for
127,316 inhabitants. .

§ 3. The authors of the Constitution foresaw that-the population
of this country would rapidly increase for ages after their labors
were done, and that many new States would be added to the Union.
They also saw that it would not do to provide for increasing the
number of members in the House of Representatives in proportion
to the increase of population; for, in such case, that body would
soon become inconveniently large for the purposes of legislative de-
liberation. VVithin one hundred years from the adoption of the

Constitution, our country will number nearly one hundred millions.

Were the House of Representatives, then, to have one member for
every thirty thousand, itwould have 3,333 members.

§ 4. VVhen the time arrives that the United States shall number
two hundred and. fifty millions, the House of Representatives will
probably be constituted on the basis of not over one member to a.
million of inhabitants. Therewill be many States, probably, at _t_h_a,t
time, which will notcontain more than two or three hundred thou~
sand each. Especiallyywill this be true of the youngerand the
smaller of the.older States. But these States must have at leastpone

S representative each, or they must be unrepresented in the national

councils. Hence the necessity of this provision, that “each State
shall have at least one representative.” ’ ‘ »

§' 5. There are several States now in _the Union, which, but for
this provision of the Constitution, would not be entitled to representa-
tion in the House. They have not the necessary "number of inhabit-

-ants '; but they each have one member on account of this clause.

§ 6. The second clause of the article under consideration refers
toequalitypof State representation in the: Senate. Wlien, in the

_Constitutional Convention, the smaller States ‘consented that popular ii

tion might become the basis of representation in the Hozlse, ‘it was
uponthe express condition that there should be- equality of repre-

230 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

sentation in the Senate‘. So tenacious were the smaller States "on
this point, that they insisted on and obtained this Constitutional pro-
vision. No majority of the States, however large, can change this
clause of the Constitution so long as there is one State that refuses

its consent to such change. The provision is for the protection of .

the smaller States.

ART. II.—PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENSHIP.
The ez't2'zen.s in each State shall be entitlecl to all the priv-

ileges and immumttes of citizens of the several States. "?%.

The purpose of this clause is to create a_ general national citizen-
ship.‘ Perhaps it does not so properly come under the rights of

‘States as the rights of citizens derived from the States. A person

being a citizen in one State of the Union may remove to any other.

‘Without prejudice to his social, pecuniary, or political rights in his

new home. ‘He may purchase, hold, convey, and inherit property,
and enjoy all other rights arising from citizenship, the same as though
he were born orinaturalized in the State to which he emigrates.
These are rights in the enjoyment of which he can not only claim
the protection of the United States, but of the States from which
and to which he removes. (See appendix to Analysis B.) T ‘

ART. III.—STATE AMITY.

' . Fallfaith anclvc7'eclz't shall be given in each State to the acts,

reeorrls, and jucltctal proceecltvzgs of every other State. ’?E..
This provision centers at once a right on States and a -right‘ on
individuals; and it imposes obligations on States: 1st. A State
has the right to demand of. another State that its _-acts, records, and
judicial proceedings,‘ shall be respected, and that full faith and
credit shall be given to them. 2d. Individuals may demand the
same, when that demand is necessary to thefvindication of their
rights. And, 3d, States on whom such demands are properlylmade
are under ,ohligatio_ns to heed and respect them.  judgment
rendered by a court in Ohio, for instance, Would be conclusive in
New York, provided the courts of Ohio would hold it conclusive.
The manner of proving S11,ch.acts, records, and judicial proceed-

Pam: II.] S RIGHTS or sracms. . 231

ings, and the effect tobe given to their authenticity, is, as we have _

seen, exclusively under the direction of Congress.

ART. IV.-’—NEVV STATES.

1. No new State shall be formed or erecteol within the jaris-.

diction of another State ,'

2. Nor shall any State be formed by the junction of two or
-more States, or parts of States, without the consent of
the legislatures of the States corlcerneol.  

§ 1. The first paragraph above was inserted by the Constitutional

Convention to quiet the fears of the larger States that their terri-

tory might be dismembered for the purpose of increasing the num-

ber of States. The second quiets the fears of the smaller States,
that a junction of States might take place without their consent.
§ 2. N 0 new State has ever been formed within the limits of the

Union by the junction of two or more States. One new State has

been formed, however, by thedismemberment of ‘another. On ‘the

passage of the Ordinance of Secession by the Virginia Convention, a

convention of the western counties of the State was held at Wl1eel-V

ing May 11, 1861, and on the 17th unanimously deposed the then

State ofﬁcers, and organized a State government. :

§3. Nov. 26, 1861, a convention representing’ the western
counties of the State assembled in Wheeling, and formed a consti-
tution for VVest Virginia. his constitution was submitted to the
people May 3, 1862, and adopted by them by a nearly unanimous
vote. The division of the State was sanctioned by the legislature

May 13,186'2,and ratiﬁed by Congress Dec. 31, 1862. West.

Virginia was admitted into the Union June 20,1863.

ART. V. — ELECTIONS.

The times, places, anal manner of holclirig elections of
senators and representatives shall be prescribecl in each State
by the l6g?:'8lCll’Lt7"6 thereof; sulgject to the revision of C’on’-gress,
emcept as to the places of choosing senators. 115.

This clause gives the regulation of the election of senators and
representatives -primarily .to the legislative. authority of the several

232: ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [Pam II.

States; Should they fail to exercise it, however,— or exercise it im-‘

properly, the interests of thecountry would justify the interposition

of Congress. (See powers of Congress, Art. XI., Part TI.) -

ART. VI.——MILITIA OFFICERS. .

1.» The appointment of the militia oﬁicers is reserved to the.

States respectively.

2. ‘Also the training of the militia according to the clisciplinei

prescribed by Congress. 43. V

.§ 1. As the National Government is to depend on the several
States for the militia, it seems proper that the oﬁ‘ic'ers who are to-
train and discipline them should be appointed by the States. This
arm or power of national "security is in some_.sense a local police
force, a means of State defense, for the proper organization and
discipline of which the several States are responsible to the national
authority. A . .
.. §‘2.. But, in order that there may be uniformityof organization

and discipline, it is left with Congress to prescribe the mode. In.

case of invasion by a foreign power, or a widespread rebellion, the

militia, of States ‘distant from each other may be placed side by side’,

in the same army, Hence the necessity of uniformity of discipline,

and of its being under the direction of a single power, instead of 1

being distributed among. the several States. The States respec-
tively have the training of the militia; but Congress prescribes _the-
mode of discipline.

ART. VII.—FEDERAL PROTECTION.

1. The United, States shall guarantee to every State in the
Union a republican form of government. ’ e

2. Shall . protect each State against in‘va"sion ,'

3. Also against domestic violence, ‘ _

protection from invasion without or insurrection within.‘ The "Want
of ‘a provision similar to this Was a serious defect in the Articles of J
Confederation. This is one of those State rights that give assurance
of the stability and solidity of the State govermnents, as Well as the
perpetuity of the Federal Union. In every age of the World, and
among all nations, there have bee'n‘designin_g, intriguing, ambitious
demagogues, ready to originate the most wicked schemes for the

‘overthrow of the governments under which they lived. Human?

nature is much the same in every age ; and but for this guaranty on
the part of the United States, and this right on the part of the
S.tates,.tl1e form of a State government, at some unlucky moment,_
and ungler-_.tl1e sway of. vile intriguers,.might be changed from a
republic to. a monarchy-.

§ 2. The States have the right of Federal protection from foreign,

invasion. . They have no right to declare War, nor even to engage in
it as States, unless the danger is so imminent as not to admit of de-_‘
lay. For the surrenderiof this right, it is but reasonable that the
National Goverrimentshould pledge its powertto defend them.‘

_ ._ § 3. Perhaps there is more danger under a republican form of
government, than under any other, of outbreaks of domestsc violence.’

Enjoying, asthe people do, a‘ greater degree of freedom under this

than under other forms of governznont, that freedom is correspond:
ingly more liable to be abused. Our own history has demonstrated
this tendency. Several times it has been found necessary to call
out the Federal troops to protect the States from internal dissensions,
and to crush open and high-handed deﬁance of State laws. The
Federal authority maybe invoked for this purpose by the legislature
of . the State, if in session, in which the insurrection occurs. If the
legislature is not in sessio_n,°and can not be readily convened, the
Governor of the State may call. on the President of the United
States for the necessary aid.

ART. VIII. —FUGITIVES.

1. FROM JUsrIeE.——A person charged  any State with
treason, felony, or other cm‘/me, who shall ‘ﬂee f9~omjus-
_t_z'ce.,.anel be found in another State, shall, on ole,-mancl

of the executive authority of the State from which he
ﬂecl, be cleliverecl up, to be removecl to the State having
juriscliction of the crime. ’?3. ‘

2. FROM SER.vIeE.——-ZVo person held to service or labor in one
State antler the laws" thereof; escaping into another,
shall, in co.nsequence.0_/" any law or regulation therein,
be disc/la-rged from such service or labor, but shall be
cleliverecl up on claim of the party to whom such‘ service

- or labor may be clue. ?4.

. § 1. The several States are political neighbors to each other. By
the ﬁrst of the foregoing provisions, if the laws of a ‘State have been
outraged by the commission of a grave crime, and the eriininal ﬂees
to a neighboring State, it is the right of the State Whose laws have
been violated to pursue the criminal, and bring him back for trial.
N o t-ate has the right to become , an asylum for criminals. This
Would afforda direct encouragement to hardened depravity. _

§ 2. By an act of Congress, passed -Feb. 12, 1793, provision was
made for enforcing this clause of the Constitution. To secure the
return of a fugitive from justice, according to that act, the following
steps must be taken :-—

1st. The Executive of the State in which the crime is committed

i must make demand for the return. of the criminal on the

, Executive of the State to which the criminal has ﬂed.

2d. The demand must be accompanied with a copy of the indict

ment against the-criminal ; or, '

535.. By an aﬂidavit made before a 1nagist_ra.te, "charging the person

i demanded with having committed the crime, and having ﬂed

from justice. V . .
4th. The copy of the indictment, or the aﬁdavit, must be certiﬁed

. by the governor or chief magistrate making the demand, to

be authentic. - ’ ~

5th. l/Vhen this is done, it is the duty of the Executive of the State

totvhieh the person has ﬂed to cause the accused to be

_ arrested andsecured.  _, J.

6th. It is the duty of the Executive causing the arrest to give notice
B thereof to the Executive making the demand, or to his agent.-

PART 11.] *  RIGHTSOFCSTATES... T 1 235

7th. Following these proceedings, the person charged with the crime
is delivered over for trial to the State authorities from which

he ﬂed. _ '

§ 3. The clause relating to fugitives from service refers to
slaves exclusively. An act was passed by Congress to enforce this

provision of the Constitution, Feb. 12, 1793, and was amended‘

Sept. 18, 1850; and both the act and amendment were repealed

‘June 28, 1864. » In 1865, an article of amendment to the Consti-
tution was ratiﬁed by a sufficient number of States to. render it a ‘
part of that instrument, for ever abolishing slavery in the United

States and its territories. The clause which we are now considering
is, therefore, no longer operative.

ART. IX. — RESERVATIONS.

1. The powers not delegated to the Untteol States by the Con-
stz'tutz'on, nor ]97‘0/7/l«7)’lb6CZ by it to the States, are reserved
to the States respectively, or to the people. ®%.

-2. The enumera-t-ion in the Oonstitutioiz of certain rights
shall not be construed to deny or disparage others re-
tained by the people. 9E.

§ 1. The ﬁrst paragraph above is intended as a general rule of
interpretation, to be applied to the Constitution in cases of doubtful
right, as between State and ,United-States authority. The powers
of the National Government are limited, being conferred and enume‘-.
rated by the people of the United States. The powers not enu-
merated are reserved to the States or the people. But this must be
understood with somequaliﬁcation. All the powers of the National

Government are not expressed in the Constitution, nor could they

be. For instance, the power to provide for the general welfare is

expressed; but no attempt is made in_that instrument to deﬁne all
the means that may be adopted to secure that object.

§ 2. Again : the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,
among the States, and with the Indian tribes, is expressed in the

Constitution; but all means that maybecome necessary to malic

thispower effective are _not enumerated, nor could they_ be by any

possible -human, forecast. A power’ conferred always implies the

20 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART I.

peculiarities of that document which distinguish it from the present
Constitution of the United States. .

§1. The Confederation was declared to be a ﬁrm league of
friendship between the several States. v _

§2. Delegates to Congress were to be appointed annually, in
such manner as the Legislature of each State might direct.

§ 3. The power was reserved to the States to recall their dele-
gates, or any of them, within the year, and to send others in their
places for the remainder of the year.

§4. No State was allowed representation in Congress by less
than two, nor more than seven, members.

§ 5. No person was eligible to a seat in Congress for more than
three in any term of six years. .

§ 6. Each State had to maintain its own delegates in a meeting
of the States, and while acting as members of the Committee of the
States. _ _

§ 7. In determining questions in the Congress, each State had

i but one vote.

§‘ 8. All charges of war and other expenses, incurred for the com-
mon defense and general welfare, were to he defrayed out of a
common treasury. ' 1 -

§9. The treasury was to be supplied by the several States,
in proportion to the value of all lands, and the improvements
and buildings thereon, within each State, granted to or surveyed
for any person, to be estimated according to the direction of Con-
gress. .

§ 10. Congress was to send and receive ambassadors.

§ 11. Congress was the tribunal of last resort, on appeal, in all
disputes and'difFerences,‘between two or more States, concerning
boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever. '

§ 12. Congress was the tribunal to decide all controversies con-

cerning the private right of soil claimed under different grants of

right to adopt the necessary means to make that poWer'eﬁ'ective,
though theyoare not speciﬁed. s ‘ '

' §'3. When this amendment was considered in Congress, there
was an eﬁ'ort’made to insert the Word “expressly” before the vvord
“‘deleg’ated ; ’s’ so that it would read, “the powers not expressly

‘delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nortprohibited

by it to the States, are reserved -to the States respectively, or to the
people.” ‘But, after thorough discussion, this Word “expressly ”
Was stricken, out. i ‘ ‘ ‘

_ § 4. The second paragraph of Art. IX., the learned commentator,
Judge Story, says, “ Was maniﬁestly introduced to prevent any per-
versevor ingenious misapplication of the Well-known maxim, that an
affirmative in particular cases implies a negative in all others; and,
e converse, that a negation in particular cases "implies an aﬂirmation

_in;a_ll others.’.’ _~ In other (words, it does not follow, nor isthis con-
struction to be tolerated, that, because certain rights are admitted as

belonging to the people, all other rights are surrendered to the
government. The people have rights, therefore, that the Constitu-

tion does not enumerate.

 § 1; The Constitution, as has been seen, _was framed’ by a"Con-'_
vention of delegates from nearly all the States, which met in Phila-
delphia in May, 1787. “then their labors were done, the prcposed~
Constitution was submitted to «Congress, with the recommendation-

that it should be submitted for ratiﬁcation to State Conventions
constituted of delegates chosen by the people of the several
States. ‘ _~ .. ' ’ ' ’ .. I -

§ 2. But it was presumed that there might be considerable hesi-
tation and delay_on the part of some of the States in ratifying the
Constitution. This had been the case with the Articles of Confed-
eration. Hence this provision, that nine States (over two-thirds)
accepting the Constitution should be sufficient for its establishment
as between those States. Had a unanimous ratiﬁcation by the
States been required before the new government could go into oper-

ation, the delay might have been several ears longer than it was;

for States, like individuals, are inﬂuenced by example. But, finding’

that success was made sure at an early day, in less than three years
after the adjournment of the Constitutional’ Convention, every State
gave its "adhesion to the new government. '

§ 3. The origin. of the obligations of the States to the General_~

Government is founded in their assent to the Constitution of the

United States. Before ratifying the Constitution, the States were_
at liberty to make their choice : they could come into the Union, or '
stay out. Should they refuse their*assent to the terms of national‘
association, they would each be an independent ‘political divisionj

having all the attributesvand prerogatives of sovereign States. But,

having accepted the terms of Union, they became subordinate. to the‘

national authority. . c _

§ 4. The same remarks apply, and with equal truth and force, to
the amendments that have been or that may be made to the Con-
stitution. ‘But there is this difference with regard to ' the amend-

ments, ——that a State may be bound by them without its consentf

provided the terms of the original instrument have been complied
with in adopting them, three-fourths of the States assenting to

them. It devolves on Congress, or on the State legislatures, to

take the initiatoryi steps in making“a.mendments" to. the Constitution

238* ANALYSIS or CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

of the ‘United States, as We have seen in Art. XIII., Chap. IV._, Part

it -requires but three-'l'ourths of the conventions or legislatures of the
several States to render the amendments valid, to all intents and
purposes, as a part of the Constitution. Even though the other one-
fourth of the several States shall not agree to the amendments, the
amendments are just as binding on them as on the States yielding

Analysis is taken says, “This Constitution, and the laws of the
United States Which shall he made in pursuance thereof, and all
treaties made, or Which shall be made, under the. authority of the

United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges

in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution

8d. All treaties made under it. p
In case of collision of authority between the United States and

ion, the authors of the Constitution were of the opinion that it
would have been radically defective.

the atienal Government would be characterized by all the wealiness t
and imbecility of the Confederation. Every principal power of the”

new Constitution would have proved a failure. A
§ 4. The cla.use and powers under consideration met with earnest
opposition while the Constitution was before the people for discussion.-

Alexander Hamilton, one of the writers of the articles in “The”-

Federalist,” says,‘ “But it is said that the laws of the Union are
to be the supreme law of the land. VVhat inferences can be drawn
from this M?’ orwliat would theyamount to if they were not to be

supreme’? It is evident they would amount to nothing. A law, by
the very meaning of the term, includes supremacy. It is a rule-
_ which those to whom it is prescribed are bound to observe. ‘This

results from every political association.”
§ 5. A treaty has been deﬁned to be a solemn and binding bar-.
gain between two or more parties competent to contract, the parties-

being nations. But it is something more than a contract. It has

not only all the force of a contract as between the parties concerned,
but all the binding authority of a law on the subjects or citizens of
the contracting parties. The issues of peace and war often depend
onthe faithful or unfaithful observance of treaties. N o nation would
be willing to make a treaty with us which should be binding on
them, but which our own citizens were at ' liberty to disregard at

pleasure. «The national faith is pledged in treaties, and there must.

be home authority to enforce their obligations on the citizen and sub-
ject.

this article is taken, it will be seen that senators and representatives

24:0 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

Constitution of the United States. Their oath’ of ofﬁce was consid-
ered in treating of the “provisions common to both houses.” No
one doubts the propriety of requiring an oath or aﬁirmation of this
character of those immediately concerned in the administration" of
the National Government; but, while the Constitution was before"
the people for ratiﬁcation, strong objections were made to requiring
that a similar obligation should be taken‘ by State ofﬁcers.

§2. Why, then, should the legislative, executive, and judicial
ofﬁcers of the several States be obliged to take onthernselves this-

solemnobligation? Because the members and oﬁicers of the State"

governments have an essential agency in giving effect to the Federal
Constitution. The election of the. President and Senate will -depend,
in all cases, on the legislatures of the several States} In many
cases, the election of the House of Representatives maybe effected
by their agency. » V ‘ ‘ ‘ ’

 § 3. The judges of the State’ courts will frequently be called upon
to decideupon the Constitution and laws and treaties of the United
St'atejs, and upon rights and claims growing out of them. Decisions
ought to be, as far as possible, uniform; and uniformity of obliga-
tion will greatly tend to such a result. ' he executive authority of
the several States may be often called upon to exert powers or allow
rights given by the Constitution, as in ﬁlling vacancies in the Senate
during the recess of the legislature ; in issuing writs of . election to
ﬁll vacancies in the House of Representatives ; in oﬁticering the
militia, and giving effect to laws -for calling them out ; and in the sur-
renderof fugitives» from justice? C C S

§‘ 1. Both of these provisions, in substance, were in the Articles of

‘Confederation. The Constitution of the United States was estab-

lished for the government of the. people as one nation, ‘and not for

the government of the individual States; But, -that the objects of

the National Government might be securedlwithout embarrassment,
it was necessary to impose restrictions on the States. \Vere the
States at liberty to treat With foreign powers or neighboring States’,

-they might enter into such arrangements as would interfere with

those made by the General Government at home and abroad.

-§_ 2. If the States were permitted to enter into treaties with for-
eign powers, the authority of the General Government on the same
matter would be at an end. cOne State might’ enter into such en-
gagements as would materially conﬂict With the interests,‘not only
of the General Government, but of the other States. This would
endanger, and perhaps destroy, the peace and‘ harmony of the whole
Union. Foreign powers might secure an ‘advantage over all the
States by securing the favor of one State. In time of war,-such
advantage might be used to the destruction and overthrow of the
whole country and its institutions.

§ 3. If. States were permitted to enter into compacts or agree-
ments with each other, they might make such arrangements as would
wholly neutralize the powers of Congress to regulate commerce
among the States. ‘These compacts and agreements ‘between the
States might be so extended as that one half the number would be
arrayed against the other half. Endless domestic discord would
result by consequence.

§ '1. ‘These are allcommercialo prohibitions. The powerto coin.

money is conﬁded to the General’ Government. VVere the States‘

invested with it, the effect would be “to multiply expensive ’mints,
and diversify the forms and weights of the circulating coins.” This
would destroy all hope of uniformity of currency, and would seri-,
ously cripple and embarrass the interests of commerce. '

§ 2. By bills of credit, as here used, is meant bank-bills, such as‘

are usually circulated as money in business transactions. As the

power to. coin money is denied to the States, certainly they'shoul'd1

not be allowed to issue a paper medium _to take the place of gold
and silver. »

A § 3. At the close of the Revolutionary VVar, and for some years
afterwards, the whole country was ﬂooded with a nearly worthless
paper currency. True, it was issued under the direction of Con-
gress ; but it was done with the expectation that the States would
each provide for ‘the redemption ‘of their respective proportions of
this paper currency. The ﬁrst issue was in 1775, and to the amount
of three millions. Congress asked the Statesto provide for its re-C
demption; but it was never done. i This paper ‘money depreciated

constantly, notwithstanding Congress passed the most stringent laws‘ .

to sustain it, —- even going so far as to denounce those who should

refuse to receive it at par as "‘ enemies to -the liberties of the United’

States.”

§ 4. Four years after the ﬁrst issue, the amount of ‘paper circula-'

tion Was upwards of one hundred and sixty millions; and, a few
years after that, it was extended beyond three hundred and ﬁfty mil-
lions. The States still failed to comply with the requisitions of
Congress to make provisions for the redemption of this “Continental
currency,” as it was called. One dollar in gold or silver was worth
from forty to a hundred dollars of these paper‘ promises ,' andﬁnally
the Continental currency became so utterly ‘worthless, thatit ceased
altogether to circulate. ' ' 1' ' C’ ‘

‘ § 5. These werethe experiences that led the authors of the Con-'

stitution to insertothis clause, prohibiting the ‘States from emitting

bills of credit. It should be stated here, that the States themselves

also had‘ largelyissued bills of credit, which had become worthless.-A

PART II.] "STATE PROHIBITIONS.‘   243

“ It was, therefore, the object of the prohibition,” as Judge Story
says, “to cut up the whole mischief by the roots, because it had
been deeply felt throughout all the States, and had deeply affected
the prosperity of all.” - "

§ 6. The States are also forbidden to pass any laws making any
thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts. This
prohibition has the samegeneral object in View as the preceding

clauses. It is intended to give uniformity and stability to the cur-

rency of the country, and to establish conﬁdence in commercial trans-
actions. Before the adoption of the Constitution, laws of various

kinds had been passed by some or all of the States, requiring credit-.

ors to take Worthless, or nearly worthless, property in payment of
debts, at exaggerated and fictitious appraisement. ‘

§ 7. Though a State can not make any thing but gold and silver
a tender in payment of debts, yet this prohibition does not apply to
the General Government. A large part of the present paper circu-

lation of the United States, as well as for several years past, is legal

tender.‘ But this is national currency.

§ 8. The States are also prohibited from passing any law impair-

ing the obligation of contracts; »But Congress has this authority,

and has lately passed a uniform bankrupt law, that is, uniform through-

out all the States ; the same in one State as in another. ~A contract

may be deﬁned, an agreement between two or more parties com-

petent to contract, based on a sufficient consideration, each promis-

ing to do or not to do some particular thing possible to be done, not

enjoined or prohibited by law.

1st. The parties must be competent to contract; that is, of proper
age, sound mind, not under duress, nor alien enemies.

2d There must be a sufficient consideration, though this need not
always be a money consideration. Previous moral or legal
obligation may be suﬁicient ; or the promise of one party may
be suﬂicient ground for the promise of the other.

3d. The thing to be done‘ must be possible. A contract to build a

, city in a. day would be void for impossibility.
4th. The thing to be done must not be such as the law already en-

. joins, as that the party promises to properly. observe the Sab-..

bath or to provide for his family.

CHAPTER IX.
DECLINE ‘AND FALL OF  CONFEDERATION.

§ 1. THE National Government, under the form and Articles of
Confederation, soon demonstrated its own weakness, and, in a few
years, resulted in a total failure. Six years of war experience with-

, out this ‘bond of union, two years of like experience with it, and

six years of peace experience mzderit, convinced the statesmen of

thatday, and indeed the people generally, that the Confederacy was _

merely the “ shadow of a government, without the substance.” .-

§ 2. The education of the leading minds and statesmen of that
day was but a revolutionary education; and their efforts at the
framework of a new government were mainly directed to such a
system as might have answered the purpose under the revolutionary
condition of things through which they were passing. ’ . A

§  But a few years of peace showed that the States, when no-

longer inﬂuenced by a fear inspired by a. sense of weakness, would
be slow to render obedience to a power of which they were jealous
from’ the beginning, and which, paradoxical’ as it may seem, was
contemptible for its very want of strength. »

§ 4. In the language of a leading mind of that day, “By this
political compact, the United States in Congress have exclusive
power for the following purposes, without being able to execute one
of them : _-—

“ 1st. They may make and conclude treaties, but can only recom-

_me2td the observance of them.

pressed by measure is forty-two cubic feet. States are forbidden by
the Constitution to lay any duties of this kind without the permis—
sion of Congress. In reference to the subject of _ duties generally,
it was the intention of the authors of the Constitution to place it
entirely under the supervision and control of Congress. In the Con-
vention that formed the Constitution, there was strong opposition
to this prohibition on the States; and it ﬁnally passed that body
by the close vote of six States against four. ‘Cue State, being
divided, gave no vote. There was a constant, earnest struggle
against the surrender of State powers to the General Government.
§2. Nor are States allowed to lay duties of any kind, except
what may be absolutely necessary for executing their inspection.-
laws ; and even these, as we have seen in another place, are under
the supervision and control of Congress. This is because to the
hands of Congress is committed the regulation of commerce, not
only with foreign nations, but among the States. The restraint on
the power of the States over imports and exports is enforced by all
the arguments which prove the necessity of submitting the regula-
tion of trade to the Federal councils.1 Inspection-laws are not,
strictly speaking, regulations of commerce. Their object is to im-
prove the quality of articles produced by the labor of the country,

and to ﬁt them for exportation or for domestic use. These laws ‘

act upon the subject before it_ becomes an article of commerce? _

The whole power to lay duties and imposts on imports and exports,‘
. and to lay a tonnage-duty, is, doubtless, properly considered a part of

the taxing power; but it may also be applied as a regulation of com?

-§ 1. Slavesrwere merely things in contemplation of the laws by
which they were held’ in bondage in the States. Yet there were
these exceptions tothis deﬁnition: they were capable of committing
crimes, and were punishable therefor ; and they were counted at the
rate of ﬁve for three in enumerating the representative population of A

the States. ‘ They were subject tovsale like other personal property.‘

They could not take property by descent or purchase, and whatever
they had belonged to. their owners. , They. could make no lawful
contracts, had no civil rights, and might be sold on execution for the
payment of the master’s debts. _

§: 2. As long as slavery existed in this country, it was a State in-
stitution, not national. At the time of the adoption of the Con-
stitution, there were thirteen States, in twelve of which slavery
existed. The authors of the Constitution recognized this condition
of things, and did not propose to interfere with it in any manner
whatever, except to bring the foreign slcwc-trade under the control
of Congress from and after the year 1808. Congress could not
interfere with it in the States ; and, when abolished, it hadto be done
by an amendment to the Constitution.

§3. In 1620, a Dutch vessel brought a cargo of slaves from
Africa to Virginia; and this was the beginning of slavery among
the. English Colonies on this continent. It existed along the banlrs
of the Hudson as early as 1626. Slavery is mentioned in the
Massachusetts laws between 1630 and 1641. Domestic slavery
having thus commenced, it continued to increase throughout the
United States while they were yet Colonies of Great» Britain. It
continued to exist among all the Southern States until it Was abol-
ished by the Constitutional Amendment of 1865. It had already
become extinct in the Eastern and Northern States. ‘

§ 4. ln Pennsylvania, by an act of March 1, 1780, and in New
Jersey, ‘by acts of Feb. 14, 17841, and Feb. 24, 1820, passed for
the gradual extinction of slavery, it was removed from them; and
all children born of oslaveparentseafter the 4th of July, 1804, were
declared free. In ‘Massachusetts, itiwas judicially declared, soon

’ after the ‘Revolutionary War, that slavery was virtually abolished

by their constitution, and that the children of female slaves, though
born prior totheir constitution, and as early as 1773, were born
free. ’ . 5‘

§ 5. In Connecticut, statutes ‘Were passed in 1784 and in 1797,
which gradually‘extinguished slayery in that State. . In 1830, there
Were but twenty-ﬁve slaves in Connecticut. T In Rhode Island, no
person could be born a slave after March 1, 1774. In New Hamp-
shire and Vermont, slavery Was abolished by their respective con-

-stitutions. It Was incorporated into the ordinance of Congress,
, July 13, 1787, for the government of the territory of the United
_ States north—West of the River Chic, that there should be neither
slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otheirirvise

than for the punishment of crimes.1 _
§ 6.’ March 6, 1820, an act of Congress was passed, known as

the Missouri Compromise, being one of the conditions on which
Missouri Was admitted into the Union as a slaveholding State. By '

this act, “ all that territory ceded by France to the United States,
under the name of Louisiana, which lies north of .thirty—siX degrees
and thirty minutes north latitude, not included Within the limits of
Missouri, Was to be free territory.” In May, 1854, this compro-

, misc was substantially repealed.

§  Down to 1850, the city of Washington was an. extensive

slave-market. Slaveholders from all parts of the slaveholding

States came there for the purpose of buying or selling H slaves.
Sept. 20, 1850, an act of Congress Was ‘passed prohibiting the traﬁic
in slaves Within the limits of the District of Columbia. April 16,
-1862, slavery Was wholly abolished Within the District of Columbia;

and, by the same act, it was abolished throughout the territories

belonging at that time to the United States, and which might
thereafter be acquired by them. The next great move was the
amendment to the Constitution, which is the subject of this article,
prohibiting the States and Territories Within the United States from
giving sanction to this institution. V The ﬁnal downfall of American
slavery dates from the year of our Lord 1865.

§ 1. The place most sacred to every citizen is that one-which he
calls his home. In the language of the law-books, a man’—s house is
his castle. The enjoyment of it, uninterrupted, is among the most

. sacred of personal rights. Arbitrary rulers, even in time of peace,

are prone to trespass on this "right, and in the very mode here for-
bidden. The eomplaint is made in the Declaration of Independence,

that the King of Great Britain has been guilty. of quartering larg

bodies of armed troops among us. . '
r 7 § '2. But it may sometimes be necessary, not only for the protec-

this amendment was attached tothe Constitution ; but it Was so fre-
quently violated to suit the caprice of rulers and tl1eir pliant oﬂicials,
tl1at it had become reduced to a mere parchment theory. The
requirements of this amendment are of the most reasonable charac-
ter. Any thing less Would be inconsistent with American liberty.

No Warrant of a general character can be issued; or, if issued,'it‘

§ 1. A capital crime is one that subjects the offenderto the pen-

to the abhorrence and detestation of mankind, and to ignominious
punishment more or less severe. These crimes and punishments are
of such grave character, that before a person shall be exposed even
to a trial for the one, or a liability to the other, the most careful and
deliberate steps must be -taken. He must ﬁrst be indicted by a.

grand jury.

§ 3.. In the proceedings before a grand jury, witnesses are called
by the attorney who acts for the people, _and these witnesses testify
as to what they _know in reference to the grounds of any accusations

‘which may be brought before the jury against any person. The

prosecuting attorney draws the indictment according to the forms of f
law; and if twelve of the grand jury, after hearing the testimony,
think there is sufficient evidence against the party accused to put
him on his trial, the foreman of the jury indorses on the bill of
indictment the words, “ A true bill,” and signs his name under
the indorsement. , V A

§ 4,. If crimes are committed in _the army or navy, or in the
militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger, there

is another method of trying the criminal. It is done by court-Inar-

tial, or by military commission, without going through with the for-
malities of an indictment. _ V , ,

§ 5. A person having been once tried for a crime, whether found
guilty or not guilty, if the jury agree on a verdict at all, can not be

_put_ on his trial a second time for the same offense. But this state-

ment must be taken with the qualiﬁcation that the accused does not
himself apply for a new trial. If he applies for a new trial, and ob-
tains it, in contemplation of law, the new trial is but a continuation
of the original proceeding; so a second trial on the same indict-

ment, where the jury fails to agree on the first trial, is but a contvlvzu-_

_ation of the trial. -

§ 1. In this article is an outline of the rights of .a party on trial
for a criminal offense. T In the ﬁrst place, he is to be informed of
the nature and cause of the accusation against him. This appears in
the indictment, which is a written accusation made by the grand jury,
on oath, at the suit of the government. The indictment must
charge the time, place, and nature and circumstances of the offense
with clearness and cer-tainty ; _ giving the accused full and deﬁnite
notice of the charge, so that he may make his defense with all
reasonable knowledge and to the best of his ability. j

§. 2. The trial shall be speedy; that is, there shall be no unneces-
sary delay. This is for the convenience of the accused. Long
delays may cause difficulty in obtaining witnesses, who may become
scattered over the country, and located at remote points ; and the pris-
oner may ﬁnd it difﬁciulti to procure bail, and thus be subjected to
protracted imprisonment waiting for his trial. The trial -must-be
public, thereby insuring fairness and impartiality, as the proceedings
are open to the inspection and criticisms of the community.‘ .. i

" § 3. And the trial .is by jury. This does not mean the grand
jury, but another, called a petal jury, consisting of twelve good and
lawful men, against whom, and each of whom, no valid and legal
objection can be -raised. This jury -must be impartial ;- that is, it
must be constituted of persons who have not already made up their
minds onrthe guilt or innocence of the party accused. The grand
jury accuses the party implicated: the petll jury tries the accusa-
tion ; «and,» in order to convict the accused, there must be entire
unanimity of the pct-it jury in favor of his guilt. .

. § 4. The jury shall be selected from the State or district" in which
the crime shall have been committed: and the district shall have
been previously ascertained by law ; that is, the district must have
been previously determlazed by law. When-we come to a discussion

254 ANALYSIS--OF‘ CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

of the "judiciary ofthe United States, we shall see that the States «

arediVided,'foi' convenience, into circuits and districts by act of
Congress. The selection of the jury from the State or district in

which the crime. is committed is supposed to secure fairness and -

iiripa1'tiality on the trial.
V . § 5. By our (loiistitution, a man can not be compelled to testify
against" himself; and this is in affirmance of a well—settled principle

_ of common law. T It -is well known that in some countries not only
. are criminals compelled to give evidence against themselves, but are

subjected to the rack or torture in order to procure a confession of
guilt; presuming that innocence would vindicate itself by a stout

resistance, or that guilt would make open confession : as if a nian’s ,

innocence were to betried by the hardness of his constitution, and
his guilt by the sensibility of his nerves 1 1
§ 6. To secure impartiality of trial, and to give a fair opportunity

of defense, the accused shall have compulsory process for obtaining
. N I O I v I I I
witnesses in his favor. Several centuries since, among the nations -

of Europe, the practice in criminal trials was to deny the accused
the liberty of having witnesses to testify in hisfavor. Afterwards,
the rigor of this tyrannical rule was so modiﬁed as to allow wit-

nesses to testify in favor of the accused, but not under oath ; thus 1

weakening their credibility. The practice now, however, is general

I to allow. the accused to make as full and complete a defense as in

his power. Under our Constitution,'if the accused is destitute of
the means of procuring the attendance of witnesses in his favor, he
may have compulsory process for this purpose, even at the expense
of the government. i

§ 7. He shall be confronted by the witnesses against him. The
accused and all witnesses appear face to face in open court. If a
witness is of a corruptland mercenary disposition, this salutary pro-
vision may have a tendency to check his recklessness in giving tes-
timony. _ _

§ 8. The accused shallhave the assistance of counsel for his de-

fense. By counsel is meant a professional lawyer, attorney, Or,
"advocate. To an American citizen, accustomed to seeing nearly

everycause in court, civil and criminal, in the hands and under. the

direction of attorneys, it seems almost needless that such a clause as
this should be made a constitutional provision. But, in capital cases
at common law, the prisoner was denied this right unless some matter
of law should arise proper to be debated. He could not have the
beneﬁt of professional assistance in the examination of Witnesses,
or in making his defense before the jury.
§ 9. It was not until the year 1836 that prisoners Were allowed
to be defended by counsel in England, except in cases of treason,
which is the gravest of crimes, and, misdemeanors which are among
the minor offenses. Under our Constitution, and most_of the State
Constitutions, if the accused is unable to employ counsel for Want
of means, counsel is assigned him by the court; so careful is the
law in thiscountry of the rights of an American citizen. V
  §1o. Excessive bail is forbidden. The meaning of the Word “ba° 
in law is to set free, liberate, deliver from arrest, or outof custody, to
the keeping of other persons, on their undertaking to be responsible

' for the appearance, at a certain day and place, of the person bailed.

He who becomes surety for the appearance of another at court is
called the bailor : he who is bailed is called the bailee. The writing

given in such cases is called the bail-bond. The bailor promises in.

the bond to pay a certain sum of money therein named if the bailee
shall fail to appear as therein speciﬁed. _

§‘11. A person accused of a crime punishable. by death is not
usually bailable : the only cases of this kind Where» bail is taken
are those in which the proof of guilt is slight. All other crimes,
except those punishable capitally, are bailable. But intriguing, op-
pressive magistrates have sometimes, in other countries, required
enormous bail, or bail in excessive and enormous sums. Bail, being
merely Surety that the accused will appear before the court, a.nd stand
l1iSVt1'ialand its consequences, should not be excessive; and our Con-
stitution Wisely and humanely forbids it.

§ 12. Excessiveﬁnes are likewise forbidden. A ﬁne is a pecu-
niary penalty imposed by a court upon a person for a criminal offense,

V or breach of law. The ﬁne is imposed after trial and conviction.

CHAPTER X.
LEADING DEFECTS OF THE CONFEDERATION.

THE following is a summary of the leading defects of the Articles
of Confederation, as a Constitution for a nation made up of a large
number of States, as given by an eminent jurist of a later day :-—

§ 1. There was an utter want of all coercive authority in the
Continental Congress to carry into effect any of their constitutional
measures. ,

§ 2. There was no power in the Continental Congress to punish
individuals for anybreach of their enactments. Their laws must
be wholly without penal sanction.

§ 3. They had no power to lay taxes, or to collect revenue for
the public service. The power over taxes was expressly and exclu-
sively reserved to- _the States. I

§ 4. They had no power to regulate commerce, either with foreign
nations, or among the several States. It was left, with respect to
both, exclusively to the management of each particular State, thus
being at the mercy of private interests or local prejudices.

§ 5. As might be expected, “‘ the most opposite regulations ex-
isted in different States; and there was a constant resort to retalia-

.tory legislation from their jealousies and rivalries in commerce, in
agriculture, or in manufactures. Foreign nations did not fail to‘.

cessive ﬁnes, as thehistory of criminal jurisprudence in other: coun-

tries ‘proves, were it notfor this constitutional prohibition.
§13. Nor shall cruel and unusual punishments be inﬂicted.
Thisneeds no comment, except the remark that history shows that

despots in the dark agestaxed their ﬁendish ingenuity to invent

punishments the most horrid, cruel, and revolting. And this pro-
hibition is for the purpose of avoiding all possibility of a repetition

of - such cruelties in this country. .

ART. V.——CIVIL ACTIONS.

In all cases at common law wherein the value in C072l§?‘0’U€9‘S’t
J

shall eacceecl twenty dollars, '

1. The right of trial by jury shall be preserved.

2. No fact triecl by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in
any court of the Unitecl States than according to the
rules of the common law. 89. t

§ 1. The common law includes those principles, usages, and
rules of action, applicable to the government and security of person

andnproperty, which do not rest fo'rtheir authority upon anyexpress

and positive declaration of the will of the legislature. It grew into
use among our English ancestry by gradual adoption ; receiving from
time to time the sanction of the courts of justice, Without any legis-_
lative act or interference. t was the application of the dictates of

natural justice and‘ of cultivated reason to particular cases.

A statute law is the Will of the legislature in Writing}

‘§"2. In paragraph 68 ‘of’ the Constitution, provision is made for
the trial of criminal cases by jury; but nothing is said there or
elsewhere in that instrument, as it came from the hands of its
authors, about trial by jury in civil cases. Those who assailed the
Constitution when it Was before the people for ratiﬁcation‘ cla.i1ned
that this omission was intended to and did abolish trial by jury in
civil cases. Hence this amendment was adopted at an early day,

"Which put’ the matter at rest. This amendment, however, refers

only to cases in the common—law courts, not to courts of admiralty’

-1 «Kent’s Cornrn., Lect; 21.

PART II.] PERSONAL RIGHTS. 257

and maritime jurisdiction, nor to -cases of equity, in which the courts
determine both the law and the fact. If the matter in ‘controversy
be less than twenty dollars, a jury trial can not be claimed, being a
matter of too little importance to warrant the expense of a jury trial.

§ 3. When a matter in controversy has once been fairly adjudi-
cated, that adjudication is a bar to any further judicial examination
or proceedings, except according to the forms and usages of the com-
mon law. There must be an end somewhere to human controversy,
and that end must be determined by legal principles and usage.
The rules of common law here spoken of, under which matters of
fact may be re-examined, refer to a contz'nuatz'0n of the investiga-
tion by a successful motion for a new trial, on cause shown, or by
writ of error, or by an appeal to another and higher tribu’nal,. M The

parties Ihavethe right to exhaust all legal remedies before the_contro-
versy is to be considered as judicially settled; but these remedies

must be pursued according to common-law usage.

T  1. Under the common law of England, and under an old Eng-

seven distinct ‘crimes. that came under the head of treason. To

terfeit theki_ng’s_coin, was treason. The English jurists were some-

times puzzled todetermine precisely what was tre_ason.- V g c __
§2. The Constitution of the United States, therefore, wisely

gives a concise deﬁnition of this crime as against the General Gov-

258   ANALYSIS<OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

ernment. Our Constitution recognizes no suchnoﬁense as covzszfruc-=
tive treason, as was the case with ‘the ancient ‘common law of Eng-
land. . There‘ are but two ways that treason can be ' committed
against the United States, and these are deﬁnedwith such precision
as to leave no room for cavil or doubt. Levying war against the
United States, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and
comfort, is treason. - -

‘ § 3-. Very early in our history, the Supreme Court of the United
States had occasion to deﬁne what is to be understood by the phrase,
“levying war.” On that occasion, the court said, “However ﬂagi-
tious may be the crime of conspiring to subvert by force the govern-
ment of our country, such «conspiracy is not treason. - To conspire
to levy war, and actually to levy war, are distinct oﬁenses. The

first (levying war) must be brought into open action by the assem-.

blage -of men for a purpose treasonable in itself, or the fact of levy-
ing war can not have been committed. _ . . . A

§ 4. “ It is not the intention of the court to say that no individual
can be guilty of this crime who has not appeared in arms against
his country. . On the contrary, if war he actually-levied, that is, if
as body of men be actually assembled for the purpose of effecting by
force a treasonable purpose, all those who perform any part, however
minute, or however remote from the scene of action, and who are
actually leagued in the general conspiracy, are to be considered as
traitors ; but there must be an actual assembling of men for the
treasonable purpose to constitute a levying of war.”

§5. The Constitution is humane to the accused, in requiring the
strictest proof for the establishment of his guilt. There must be
two witnesses, at least, to the same overt act, unless the prisoner

make confession in open court. Confessions out of court, though-

testiﬁed to by any number of witnesses, are not suﬁicient. Confes-
sions (out of court) are said to be the weakest and most suspicious
of all testimony ; ever liable to be obtained by artiﬁce, "false hopes,

promises of favor, or menaces; seldom remembered accurately or

reported with due precision, and incapable in their nature of being

. disproved by other negative evidence} There must, as there should,

be a concurrence of two witnesses to the same overt act, that is,
open act of treason, Who are above all reasonable exception.1 ‘
The power of Congress to declare the punishment of treason Was

noticed in Chap. IV., Art. IV., Part II.

ART. VII.i— OFFICIAL IMM-UNITIES.

'e0cce]ot treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be
privileged from arrest, _.

1st. Daring attendance at their respective houses ,' h

A 2d. While going to and returning from the same.

2. OF SPEECH. — For any speech or debate in either house,

they shall not be questioned in any other place. %E.—

§ 1. Although freedom from arrest is here classed under thetitle
of’ “Personal Rights,” as it relates to members of Congress, yet it
is as much the right of their constituencies, and of the houses of
which they are members, as it is the right of the members themselves.
It is an oﬁicial immunity. It is a right universally accorded to
members of legislative bodies inall countries, and in all the States

of this Union. They can be arrested for crime only. Blackstone

says, “It has immemorially constituted a privilege of both houses ,

u

of the British Parliament.”

§ 2. Thomas Jefferson says, “ It seems absolutely indispensable

for the just exercise of the legislative power in every nation purport-
ing to possess a free Constitution of government ; and it can not be
surrendered Without endangering the public liberties aswell as the
private independence of the members.” Of course, an arrest of a
member of Congress Would prevent the performance of his duties in
the house of Which he Was a member. His constituency Would be
left Without representation. The public interests, which are always
consideredparamount to private, must suffer for Want of attention.
The privilege is considered not that of the member or of his con-
stituents only, but a privilege of the house also.

: § 3.“ And, for the purpose of securing entire freedom of discussion,
'n,o'memberof either house can legally be questioned elsewhere for
any thing which he may see ﬁt to utter in debate in his place as a

member; that is, he can not legally be called to account before-the

courts, no matterhow much he may slander private character. Of
course, this is a right which may be, and sometimes is, abused. But
the public interests may require the "most critical and searching
examinations into personal and oﬁcial qualiﬁcations of individuals
proposed as ‘candidates ‘for public stations of grave responsibility.
Members should be allowed to ‘perform these duties withoutfear of
future personal retribution. '

EXECUTIVE CDEVPARTMENT.

ART. I.-—IN VVHOM VESTED.

In at _P7'esz'clent of the Unitecl States gf Amemfca. 53.

_§ 1. Under the Confederation,‘ there was no such ofﬁcer as a
_Pireside‘n't‘ of the United States». ' There was an Executive Committee
of thirteen’, one from each tate, having no power except during
the recesses of Congress. Congress possessed the executive power
-while in session. Alexander Hamilton says in “The Federalist,’-‘
“ There istharclliy any part of the system [of government], the
’arrangement“of which could have been attended with greater"difti'-
culty ; and there is none which has been inveighed against with less
candor, or criticised with less judgment.” A ']:3heseire1narks'were
made while the Constitution was before the people for deliberation.

§ 2.‘ Energy in the Executive" is one indispensable characteristic
in the deﬁnition of good ‘government ;' for the duty of this depart-
ment is tosee that the laws are faithfully and promptly executed.
A feeble Executive implies a feeble ‘execution of the government.
'A"feebleexecution isbut another phrase for a bad execution ;’ and
a government ill executed, whatever it ‘maybe in-theory, must he a.
bad government in practice} » A

'”§ 3} It was a subject of much and earnest‘ debate in the. Conven-
tion that formed the Constitution, whether this department shouldbe

placedin the hands of one, or in the hands of‘ several. N 0 subject _

was more thoroughly discussed in that body. It was maintained that
energy would be most likely to be secured by unity of executive, and
that Wisdom would be most likely to be secured by a plurality 3 and
that the latter would be most. likely to command the confidence. of
the people. i. T T ' ' ’

§ 4. As the executive ip‘rer'ogative is limited to the faitlifril execu-

.tion"of the laws after they shall have been duly enacted and pro-

mulgated, it was doubtless most judicious that the executive power
should be vested in a single individual. It gives a st-ronger sense
of personal responsibility. No- discretion is "submitted to the execu-
tive; ofﬁcer as to the wisdom or‘ expediency of the law. What has
once been declared to be law, under all the cautious forms of delib-
eration prescribed by the ‘Constitution, ought to receive prompt
obedience} . _ 3 T

T ART.’ II.——TERM. ,

He shall hold his oﬁice clearing the ternz of four years. 
T § 1. Thiswas a subject on which there was a ‘great variety of
opinion in the Convention. There were those who favored the prop-
osition thatthe Executive should hold his office for life, or during’
good behavior. , At one stage of the proceedings, seven years was
ﬁxed as the duration of the term. The term of four years was
ﬁnally ﬁxed upon as a compromise; for there were members in

favor of one year, others in favor of two, and othersthree years.
§  The term of four years is intermediate between the term of
office of the Senate and that of the House of Representatives. In
the course of one presidential term, the House is, or may be, twice
recomposed, and two—thirds of the Senate changed or re-elected?
The executive term should not be so short ‘as to be constantly
changing from one incumbent to another, giving the government no
poppoitunity to test by experience the policy of its measures; nor,

on the other hand, should it be so long as to allow an obstinate

didate for this ofﬁce sufficient time to demonstrate his character, and

to enable his fellow-citizens to judge-of his ﬁtness for the high posi-

tion of chief executive of a great nation. The mental faculties are
usually in full vigor at this age ; and opportunities must have been
aﬁbrded for long public service, and for varied and large experience,
in the public councils. "

§ 2. Fourteen years’ residence in the United States is intended
not only to give opportunity for an extensive acquaintance on the

part of his fellow-citizens with the candidate for this ofﬁce, but also

to furnish him With the requisite knowledge of the Wants and insti-
tutions of the country. Besides, it may be presumed that a citizen
Whose residence has been chieﬂy abroad may not only be deﬁcient
in affection for his own country, but mayhave become partial to
the institutions of other countries with which he has long been
familiar. , i .

§ 3. The Constitution requires that the President shall be a

natural-born citizen of the United States, or a citizen at the time of t

the adoption of the Constitution. This is an important restriction,-
when We consider the sacredness of the-trust committed to the

, charge of the Executive. It will; be useless for ambitious foreigners

and had proved their attachments to our institutions beyond all doubt;

It would have been ungenerous and ungrateful to have ‘excludedf
this class of citizens from all possibility of attaining to any oﬁice,"

however exalted, under a government which they had sacriﬁced so

much to establish. Hence this saving clause of the Constitution,‘

that, if a person wasa citizen of the United States at the time of the
ad0ption_of that instrument, he became eligible to the Presidency.
But, by the lapse of time, this clause has become practically obsolete,

§ 5'. ' The President is eligible to re-election without limitation :‘

thus far, however, there has never been a second re-‘election. * In

States} Thus the sense of the people operates in the choice of the
Chief Magistrate with much more certainty than itvvould Were the
choice of electors conﬁded to a pre-existing body. The immediate
election of the President and Vice-President is committed to men

chosen for that speciﬁc purpose. A small number of persons select-
ed by their fellovv-citizens from the general mass will be most likely’

to possess the information. and discernment requisite to so complicat-

ed an investigation.” We have seen in Chap. VII., Pa-rt IL, of i
this Work, thatnosenator, representative’, or other person holding a

place of trust or proﬁt under the United States, can be an elector of
President and Vice-President.

,.§ 4.. The number of electors corresponds with the number of
senators and rep_resentatives to which the States are respectively en-
titled in Congress. Thus each State has about the same inﬂuence r

in the election of President and Vice-President that it has in the
national councils. T '

§ 5. This matter of the meeting of the electors in their respective.

States is a mere matter of form. No discussion of the merits of
the candidates for President and Vice-President takes place; and,
indeed, none is expected. The electors are chosen Wholly with
reference to particular persons Who have been put in nomination at

I a convention called for thatipurpose ; andthe electors arepledged to‘
vote for these nominees, and are" in no sense at liberty to vote other-

wise. The object of appointing electors Was, by the authors of the

Constitution, to give opportunity for deliberation, and for cautiously‘
analyzing the characters of candidates for these high trusts ; but
this object has been Wholly defeated by the practices of the political

parties arrayed against each other. '
. § 6. Hence’ the meeting of the electors, as before stated, is a mere

matter of form. Nothing is left to the electors but to cast their‘

votes according to ‘previous pledges ;i and any exercise of an inde-

§ 7. The country was deeply in debt, without a dollar to pay, or
the means even to draw a dollar into the public treasury ; and what
money there was in the country was rapidly making its way abroad.

§ 8. Great as these embarrassments were, the States, full of jeal-
ousy, were tenaciously opposed to making the necessary concessions
to remedy the great and growing evil. All became impressed with
the fear, that, unless a much stronger national government could be
instituted, all that had been gained by the Revolutionary struggle
would soon be lost. "

§ 9.‘ Many of the ‘more prominent patriots and statesmen of the

day had made the effort to obtain an enlargement of the powers of .

Congress, but without success. It became evident, that, whatever
else might be done, the Confederacy, as such, must crumble into
ruins.

CHAPTER XI.
ORIGIN or THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION.

§ 1. To the State of Virginia belongs the immortal honor of tak-
ing the ﬁrst step that led to the formation and adoption of our pres-
ent Constitution ; a.nd to the illustrious James Madison, more than
to any other man,’ must be awarded the distinction of making the
ﬁrst effective move in that direction. '

§,2. On the 21st of January, 1786,.the legislature of Virginia.
passed the following resolution :—

“ Resolved, That Edmund Randolph, James Madison, jun., VVal-

ter;'Jones, St. George Tucker, and Meriweather Smith, pEsqs., be

appointed Commissioners, who, or_ any three of whom, shall meet
‘such commissioners as may be appointed in the other States of the

tory of the ﬁrst, -ﬁxing the day on which electors should be elected
throughout the United -States. ,That~d,ay» is the Tuesday next -after
the first 'Monday in the month off Nov_en1ber of the year in which
they are chosen. The day on which the electors are :to- give their
votes was not changed by this amendment, but remains the first
Wednesday of December next after their election; 3 »
up §. 9.. By this act, each State may provid_e by law for-ﬁlling vacan-
cies, if any "occur, when the electors meet to give their electoral
votes. . The States may each provide bylaw also for appointing
electors afterwards, if an election of electorson the day prescribed
by Congress results in a failure to elect one or more of -the electors.
‘§ 10. By this act of March 1, 1792, the electors of each State
are ‘to meet at such ‘place as“ the ‘ legislature thereof may designate,
and give theirvotes by ballot for President and'Vice-‘President.
They‘ are then to make and sign three certiﬁcates of - all the votes ‘by’
them. given, and they are to seal them up. Theyare to certify on
each certiﬁcate that a list of the votes of their States respectively
for President ‘and Vice-President is contained therein.
~"‘They shall appoint a-person to take charge of and deliver one of
the saine certiﬁcates to the President of the Senate at the seat of gov»
erninent before the first Wednesday of January then next ensuing-
‘~ * Another of the certiﬁcates is to be forwarded forthwith by mail

: §151”. It will be 'observed,'that although the lists of personsvoted

for as President and Vice-President are directed ‘to the President of
the ‘Senate, yet he must open them in the presence. of both houses.
This gives dignity and insures fairness ‘in the proceeding. The
votes are counted by tellers appointed for that purpose by the Presi-
dent of . the Senate. The proceeding takes place in the House of
Representatives. ‘ .

§12. N 0‘ person can be declared elected who does not receive a

majority of the whole number of electors appointed. Usually there‘

are but two candidates in the ﬁeld, each placed in nomination by

the political party with whose principles he is identiﬁed ; but it has

sometimes happened that three or more were placed in nomination‘.
In such cases, it might be quite likely that no candidate Would. re-T
ceive a full majority of all the electoral votes. Such was the case
in 1825, at the election for the tenth Presidential term. Four can-
didates were in the ﬁeld, neither of Whom received a majority of all
the electoral votes: so there Was a failure to elect a President by
the people.’ The Constitution has made provision for such cases by
referring the election to the House of Representatives as a last

resort; — .

body, as the members of which it is constituted are ‘chosen by the
popular voice, and are the more immediate representatives of the
people. But, when the election takes place in the house, the selec-
tionamust be made from the persons already voted for byelectoral

vote." The house is not-at liberty to take up a new candidate, and _

their selectionmustbe conﬁned to thosereceiving A the highest num-i
bers, not exceeding three, on the list of personsvoted for as President.‘
This provision is made for the purpose of excluding from the list all
such persons as receive but a small numberof the electoral votes.
§14. The vote must be taken by ballot and by States ; each State

having but one vote. The mode of voting by ‘States, if the choice .
should fall to the House of Representatives, was but a just compen-’

sation -to the smaller, States for their loss in the primary election.
When the peoplevote for the President, it is manifest that the large
States enjoy a decided advantage over’ the small States; and thus
their'interests-may be neglected or sacriﬁced. To compensate them
for this, in the eventual election by the House of Representatives", at
corresponding advantage is given to the small States. It Was, in
fact, a— compromise.1 i

There is no injustice in this ; and, if the people do not elect a *

President, there is a greater chance of electing one in this mode

than there Would be by a mererepresentative vote according to nurn-T
‘hers, as the same divisions Would‘ probably exist in the popular

branchas in their respective States.2
‘It may be remarked here that this Was the mode of passing laws
under the Confederation. A

unless at least two-thirds of the States are represented on the ﬂoor.
A majority cantransact the ordinary business of legislation; but
the election of a Chief Magistrate of the nation was regarded by the
authors of the Constitution as a matter of ' such grave interest to the
country, thattthey did not hesitate to insert this provision with
unanimity. V A majority of all the States is necessary to a choice,
not a’ majorityrof the;States-present by representation ;- that is, not

.a majority of the quorum, buta majority of all the States.-

e §16. It may occur, however, that- even the House of Representa-
tives shall fail to elect a President of the United States within the
time limited for such election by the Constitution. They have three

candidates, neither of whom, «perhaps, may receive a majority of- all -

the States. They. may continue to vote on the question, however-,
until the fourth day of the March next following the commencement
of their effort. But their trial may result in a failure. In such
case, the Vice-President shall act as President, as in case of the death
or other constitutional disability of the President. (See the next
chapter.) _ . _
§17. The present method of electing a President of the United
States, which we have been considering, is in accordance with the
provisions of the 12th Article of Amendments to the Constitution,
This amendment was proposed by Congress in October, 1803 ; and
was ratiﬁed so as to become a part of the Constitution before Sep-
tember, 1804. In the copy of the Constitutionfound in this work,
it is marked as paragraph 94. The-original article,— of which para‘-
graph~94 is an amendment, is not numbered ; but it is still printed
with copies of the Constitution, and is known as clause 3, section 1',
of Art. II. It is inserted‘ merely to show what it -was. The article
and amendment differ in several important particulars- .
lest. -By the original article, the electors voted each for two persons
as President. a By the amendment, the electors vote for two‘
persons, but designating one as »_ Presiderzt, and the other as
, Vz'ce-Presz''de7zt. j A _ - , V - ‘ i ' - a
2d. By the original article, two persons might each receive a majori-
ty of the whole number of electors appointed. By the
amendment this is impossible, as each elector votes for only
one person as President, and one as -Vice-President.
3d. If more than one person had a -majorityof the electoral votes,
I and each an equalnumber, the election went into the House
A of Representatives on those two -names. - _- - ;
4th. If two candidates received each a majority of all the electoral
votes,»but— one of whom received a larger vote than the other,
the one‘ receiving the highest vote was elected. , A
5th. If no personireceived a majority of all the electoral votes, the

270 ANALYSISQF-CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II-

election went to the "House of ‘Representatives 5 and, from the
ﬁve highest on the list,— they were to make the election. By
the amendment, it is from the three highest on the list.
6th. In every case, after: the choice of the President, the person

that number were a majority or not, was to be the Vice-‘

President. A 1- - » P 1 P P -
7th. If two or more received an I‘equal.. number, and being highest
P on the list, the election Went into the Senate on these two or
-P more names. -Thus the Vice-President could not be elected
until after the election of the "President. . .
8th. By the original article, the Senate wasto elect the Vice-Presi-
dent by ballot: this is not required under the amendment.
9th. Underthe amendment, the Vice-President actsas President if

the House of Representatives fail to elect a President on or .

before the fourth day of , March thennext following, when the
right to do so shall devolve on them ; but, under tlieoriginal
’ , article, no ‘Vice-President. could be elected until after the
_ President should be elected. L if 1  ' I ‘
§1'8. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was elected President by the
House of Representatives; and, in 1825, John Quincy Adams also.
These are the onlyinstances in our history of the election of a Chief
M-agistrateby the House of Representatives. The protracted con-_
test in the house in 1801 between Thomas Jefferson "and Aaron
Burr, candidates for the Presidency, led to the adoption of the 12th
Article of Amendments. The number of electoral votes for each
of these’ two candidates was equal, each having a majority of» the
whole number. In accordance with the provisions of the original
article for electing a President, the election went into the house.
There, through thirty-ﬁve ballotings, the results were uniform ; Jef-
ferson receiving the votes of eight ‘States, Burr of six, and two being
divided. There were sixteen States in the Union at that time. On
the thirty-sixth ba1lot,Jeﬁ"erson received the votes of nine States,
givingihim aimajority of the whole.  1 i P A it ‘

I. § 1. Withotit this clause, the Executive would be dependent for

his support on the Will of Congress. By securing their favor, his

salary might be greatly enlarged ; and, by incurring their displeasure,
it might be greatly diminished. If Congress were allowed a dis-
cretionary power over the salary of the Executive (as men of high
station are not always beyond the reach of temptation) ., his approba-
tion of legislative measures might sometimes depend on the liberal-

‘ity of legislative appropriations. There are men who could be
inﬂuenced by no such mercenary motive ; but, on the other hand,

instances of historic notoriety, even in this country, might be cited
in proof of the ‘purchase of Executive favor through the seductive

iallurements of pecuniary considerations.

— § 2. As the Executive salary is in the’ beginning of his term, so
it must remain to the end. Congress has no power to alter it, by

increase or diminution, to take effect before a new election and ‘a '
new period of service shall begin. The first year of 'Washington’s

ﬁrst term, Sept. 24, 1789, the President’s salary was ﬁxed at
twenty—1’ive . thousand dollars a year. Feb. 18, 1793, an act was
passed permanently establishingthe‘President’s salary at this sum.
But he has the White House, which is the Executive Mansion, rent
free. The house is also furnished for him and taken care of, the
grounds cultivated, his fuel and light provided, and many other

things at the expense of the public treasury.

however, either in our foreign or domestic wars, or in our border
warfare with the Indians. ,- _ , T , e , T i 3

_ § 2, Though the President does not take the ﬁeld in person, there
is a sense in which he takes command of the army and navy. He
directs the application of the military force in the execution of the

' laws, in maintaining peace at home, and in resisting foreign aggres-
sion. These duties are of an executive character, and are properly

in-chief of the militia of the several States when called‘ into the actual

‘service of thesUnited States. The chief military dependence of the

‘on the ‘militia of the several States. The standing army is constituted

of but a few thousandsat most ; while, if necessary, the militia may
be called forth by the million. In order that there may be unity of
action, uniformity of training and discipline, and concert of purpose,
it is necessary that regulars and militia should be subordinate to a
single head.

and before ~execution ; or considerations of public policy may require.

a like interference‘. The same reasons might justify the grant of a

full pardon. Discretionary power over such cases should be vested-

somewhere, “ as the law can notbe framed on principles of compas-
sion toguilt.” The chief executive magistrate should be allowed
to hold a court of equity in his own breast, to soften the rigor of the

general law in such criminal cases as may merit an exemption from

punishment, or iasimay properly plead for temporary delay of execu-
tion of _ sentence. ' V I

§ 6. In monarchical countries, this prerogative belongs to the
sovereign. It can not be denied, that, in a republic, it should -be
vested in the hands of the chief executive magistrate, if the power
is to be exercised’ at all. p In the administration of human govern-
ment’, the exercise of the benign power of reprieveand pardon may
often become necessary from motives of humanity and good policy.

Union, at a time and place -to be agreed on, to take into considera-
tion the trade of the United States ;

“ To examine the relative ‘situations and trade of said States ;

“ To consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regu-

nent harmony ; '

. “And to report to the several States such act relative to this
great object, as, when unanimously ratiﬁed by them, will enable the
United States in Congress effectually to provide for the same.”

§ 3. Just previous to this, in 1785, Commissioners had been
appointed by Virginia and Maryland for the accomplishment of a
more limited object, and which more exclusively concerned those
two States.

§4. Maryland deemed the concurrence of her neighbors, Dela-
Ware and Pennsylvania, indispensable in the matter; although it
related only to settling the jurisdiction on Waters dividing the two
States of Virginia and Maryland. The same reasons that rendered
it necessary that Maryland should consult her neighbors seemed to
render it equally necessary that those neighbors should consult tlzeir
neighbors.

§ 5. It was thus demonstrated, that, whatever action. might be
taken on any subject of general concern, it Would extend itself or
its inﬂuences all over the Union. This illustration of the neces-
sity of uniformity in matters. of public interest had its influence in
impressing all minds with a sense of the importance of such a gen-
eral Convention as-Was now recommended in the resolution of the
Virginia Legislature.

i_ § 10. \Vhen nominations are made by the President, they are pref.

sented to the Senate in writing  and this body acts upon‘ them in
secret session, and .under theinjunctign that discussions on their
merits or the qualiﬁcations of the nominees shall be kept secret. A
numerical majority of the Senate decides the question of conﬁrma-
tion or rejection of the candidate —nominated.~ If the nominee is
conﬁrmed, or the nomination ratiﬁed, the President issues a commis-
sion accordingly, unless, in the mean time, he -has concluded to
decline it, which he is atliberty to do ; in which case, he may make

- another nomination. , i _ _ _ . q . ‘ »
§ 11., The responsibility of s the Senate and the: President is dis;

tinct. He can never be compelled to yield to their appointment of
a-man unﬁt » for office ; and, on the other hand, they may withhold
their advice and consent from any candidate, who, in their judgment,
does not possess due qualiﬁcations for ofﬁce. But it is not expected
that the Senate will ordinarily fail of ratifyijng the appointment of a
suitable person for the ofﬁcef‘ '9 t " to

§ 12- The power of removal from .Ofﬁces filled by the united '

authority of President and Senate has, for the most part, been con-
ceded to the President alone. Grave doubts of the propriety of

this, however, have been expressed by prominent and distinguished ’

statesmen from the earliest period of our‘history, under our present

Constitution. Many have contended, that, since the Constitution is a

silent on the subject, it should require the same power to remove
that it does to appoint, esp.e_cia'lly_ while the Senate is in session.

§ 1:3. March'2, 1867, an act_'_of Congress was passed, regulating
the tenure of certain civil offices. By this act, persons holding or
appointed to any civil office by and with the advice and consent of
the Senate -shall be entitled to hold such office until .a successor is
appointed in like manner and duly qualiﬁed. The heads of execu-

tive departments, andpalso the Attorn_ey«-General, shall hold their.
oiﬁces respectively for and .during the term_ of the President by whom ‘

they may have been appointed, and for one month thereafter, subject
to removal by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The
President, for cause shown, can suspend, during the recess of the
Senate, any civil officers thus appointed, until the next meeting of:

that body, and until such suspension be acted upon by them-.’

Judges of the United—States courts are excepted from the operation

of this provision.
§ 14. In such case, it is made the duty of the President, vvithin
twenty days after the meeting of the Senate, to report to the Senate

such suspension, With the evidence and reasons for hisaction in the

case. If the Senate concurs, the President may remove the officer,

and appoint a successor. If the Senate does not concur,the sus-“
pended oﬂicer resumes his oﬂice, and receives again the ‘official salary

and emoluments.

§ 15. An ambassador is a minister of the highest ranii, employed?
by governmentto represent it, and to manage its interests, at the‘

court or seat of government of some other power. The Word “min-

ister,” as used in the Constitution“, has nearly the same signiﬁcation 1

as “ ambassador, ’ ’

especially minister plenipotentiary. A consul P

is aoperson commissioned to reside in a foreign country, as an agent
or ‘representative of a government, to protect the rights, commerce," '
merchants, and seamen of the State, and to ‘aid in any commercial,

and sometimes in diplomatic, transactions with such foreign country.

Senate, as that body is not in perpetual session; and, "unless there
Were some power to ﬁll the vacancies, of course the interests of the
country might suffer. While the Senate is in session, the President
has no such authority. All appointments made under this ‘clause

§ 17. This clause is on the subject usually known as the messagés

of the President. He enjoys sources of information on all subjects, .
foreign and domestic, far superior-to those -belonging to any other .:
branch‘ of the government. Out of the ﬁrst part of 5-this clause has ‘
come the practice of delivering to Congress the annual ‘messages ; .

and out of the second, the practice of delivering occasional special mes-

sages. P On account of his intimacywith the heads of departments, .

he may be presumed to be in possession of valuable information re-

garding the workings of the laws, the systems of ‘trade, ﬁnance,"

and the operations of the judiciary, military, naval, and civil estab-

lishments of the Union. It is in the highest degree proper that;

information on these matters, in the most practical form, should be

communicated to Congress, and that the President should recom-
mend such measures as he may deem necessary for the ‘correction of 1

any defeots which may have become apparent.

§ 18. “The practice in the time of Washington and John Adams

was for the President, atithe opening of each session of Congress,
to meet both houses in person, and deliver a speech to them, con-
taining his views ‘on public affairs, and his recommendations of meas-
ures. 'On other occasions, he simply addressed written messages to

them, or either of them,‘according to the nature of the message;

To the speeches ‘thus made a written answer was given by each

house ; and thus an opportunity was ‘afforded by the opponents of “

the "a.drnvinistration toireviewits whole policy in a single debate on the

answer. i That’ practice was discontinued by: President Jefferson‘,-

who addressed all his communications to. Congress by written mes-

§g_19. Events may occur, entirely unforeseen by the Congress at
its-last session, imperiling the interests of the country, and requir-

ing the immediate convocation of that body. A '_ An event of .this.kindV—i
transpired in‘ the month of April, 1861, from the date of» which,-
hostilities becamegeneral between the North and the South. Presi.-jﬂ
dent Lincoln summoned Congress to_ meet the fourth. day of the _.

following July. That the power to call a meeting of. Congress

should be vested somewhere, there can be no doubt; and that it

should be committed to the discretion of the Executive, all agree.

§20. It might be barely possible that Congress should fail to".

agree on the time of adjournment ; and, should such an exigency

arise,’ there can be no doubt that the Executive is the most suitable _

third party to,intert'ere for the peaceable termination of the contro-V-,

Senate, appoirufs ambassadors,,'ot-her public ministers, and consuls,

though he comes clothed’ With proper authority from. anationfwith

‘Whom We areat peace, and Whichis recognized among the great

family of nations. A refusal is not a just cause of War, nor even

of offense in the national sense ; though it might be deemed an un-

friendly ‘act were it not accompanied by friendly explanations.
up §. 23. A refusal is sometimes made on the" ground. of the bad

character of the minister, or his ‘former offensive conduct, or ofthe

subject of the embassynot-being proper, or convenient for discus-
sion. ' But a much moredelicate occasion is when a civil war breaks
out in a nation, each party claiming the sovereignty of the whole,
and the contest has not yet been settled between the contending
parties. In such a case, ‘a neutral n.ation,_may very properly with-
hold its recognition of the supremacy of either party, and refuse to
receive a minister from eitfher.1“ ‘Suppose Great Britain had recog-
nized the seceded States during the Great Rebellion as an independ-
ent. nation,. the United States would probably have called hometheir
own minister from that country, and War might have been the result.

all the formalities of the Constitution, it is the solemn duty of the

President of the United States to enforce its execution, until it is
either repealed, or declared by competent authority to be unconstitu-
tional. ,He has no discretion, but must not only render obedience
to’ the law himself, but must enforce its execution on all others.

§ 1. The ﬁrst part of this "article refers to the proceedings in
Congress on opening and counting theielectoral votes .for:President
and Vice-Presidentpof the United‘ States. It Will be remembered,

that, if no. personreceivesa majority of all the electoral votes -for»

President, the election of that officer devolves on the House of Rep—
resentatives. But the house does not elect the Vice-President if
there is a failure to‘ elect that officer by the majority of the electoral

votes, In‘ such case, ‘the, Senate elects the Vice-P_resid_e_nt. , 
only instance of this kind in our history Was the election of Richard

_ § 2, As just stated, the Senate chooses the Vice-President if no

TheVice-President is not novv, as formerly,;a competitor for the

office of President. , There is scarcely a possibility that the Senate
can fail to elect the Vi_ce—President, as they must conﬁne their votes ’

to the two highest candi_da.tes, on the list of pers_ons__, voted foras, such

too improbable i to ‘merit serious discussion‘, especially as the Senate‘

would be at liberty to repeat the trial to elect until they should be

successful.

§ 3. As the Vice-President is the President of the Senate, it

seems proper that the Senate should elect this ofﬁcer incase of ‘fail’-
ure toelect by the electors‘. The proceeding ‘is‘judiciously* guarded

in‘ requiring two-thirds of all the members of the'Senate to be present,‘

and in still further "requiring ‘a majority of all the senatorsto secure

are such as usually devolve on the presiding officer of legislative ,

bodies.. He is to preside over the deliberations of the Senate, en-

.force therules, of order, maintain due decorum among the members,

and decide all questions of . parliamentary practice’. He submits all
motions duly made to the Senate, puts to vote all questions brought
forward for discussion and decision,_ and makes known the result.
He also has the appointment of the standing committees ; and it is
his duty to : see that the other officers of the house faithfully dis-
charge their duties. « r e . « .

§ 2. Whenever the Vice-President succeeds to the Presidency,or
becomes acting President, he performs all the duties of that ofﬁcer
as though he were originally elected to that oﬂice. Doubts have
been entertained by persons entitled to great conﬁdence, that the

acting President who reaches that office ‘through the‘Vice-Presidency ‘

is in fact —Presz'dent. But Congress has uniformly recognized the

‘Executive, in such cases, as President to all intents and purposes;

making no distinction whatever between him and a President origi-
nally electedas such by the people. In the articles of impeachment
presented against Andrew Johnson, he was described as rPresgz'dent
of the United States ; and the committee expressly stated that
they had thoroughly and critically discussed the propriety of this
description of his oﬂicial title. So it may be regarded as settled-"by
themost authoritative precedents, that a Vice-Presidentbecoming
acting President is President in fact.

2. In such inferior courts as Congress may from time, to
- time ordain and establish. 65.

. § 1.. “To establish justice.” was one of the principal objects to .
be attained by the formation of the Constitution. ‘ This has noref-_,.

PART-1.1.] r  -JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.-SF I 285

erence to the-1 State judiciaries, but to -the creation orfa. national

judicial tribunal. Under the Confederation, there was no national—

judicial department. The dispensation of justice through the State
courts Was capricious and uncertain. Theywere inﬂuenced by local
interests,"_and therefore their decisions were various andconﬂicting.

§ 2. The Constitutional Convention was unanimously in favor of
establishing a Supreme Court, although at ﬁrst there was some ‘di-
versityof opinion on the propriety of the plan of including inferior
tribunals. But, after thorough and exhaustive discussion, the propo-
sition received the unanimous approval of the Convention.

§ 3. The -establishment of inferior tribunals would seem to re-
sult necessarily from the establishment of a Supreme Court. Re-
course could not be had to the Supreme Court in all cases which
might properly be subjects of Federal adjudication. It would be out
of the power of any single court to dispose of the immense amount of
business that would be sure‘ to demand their attention. Without
inferior tribunals easy of access, the sanctuary of justice Would be

closed to the great majority of American citizens. Under the__ au-

thority to establish inferior tribunals, each State or district can have
a Federal court or courts of its own, competent to the adjudication
of all matters of Federal jurisdiction Within its limits. .

§ 4. -The judges of the Supreme Court at present are one chief

justice, and nine associate justices, any six of whom constitute a‘

quorum. The number of judges at the organization of .the court
in September, 1789, Was six, ——one chief ' justice, and ﬁve associate
justices. March 3, 1837, the number was extended to nine,-—one
chief justice, and eight associate justices. March 3, 1863, the
number was extended to ten, —— one chief justice, and nine associate
justices. This court holds one term a year in the city of Washing-
ton, beginning the ﬁrst Monday of December. _

-§ 5. The United Statesare divided, for judicial purposes and con-
venience, into ten circuits, and these circuits are subdivided into dis-V
tricts. Each of the judges of the Supreme Court presides at a
circuit court, assistedby the district. judge of the district court in

failed -to attend. But it had become evident, that, notwithstanding
this Convention, as such, was a failure, public opinion was advancing
in the right direction. .

§ 8. The N ew-J ersey deputation had a commission extending its
object to a general provision for the “exigencies of the Union.”
Acting on this suggestion, a recommendation for this enlarged pur-
pose was reported by a committee to whom the subject had been
referred. , .

§p9. That report was written by Alexander Hamilton of New
York, and addressed to the legislatures of the States represented in
the Convention ; viz., New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, ADela-
ware, and New Jersey. . . .

Commissioners appointed from New Hampshire, Massachusetts,

Rhode Island, and North Carolina, failed to report themselves to

the Convention. —

The States of Maryland, Connecticut, South Carolina, and Geor-
gia, did not appoint Commissioners.

§ 10. This report was an able, lucid, and elaborate document,
recommending another convention of deputies from all the States,
to meet on the second Monday of May following, 1787, in the city
of Philadelphia. A copy of the report was also sent to Congress.

§ 11. Virginia again took the lead, and was the first to act favor-
ably on the recommendation to appoint deputies to the proposed
Philadelphia Convention. The legislature of that State were unani-
mous, or very nearly so, in their response to the call of the report.
“ As a proof of the magnitude and solemnity attached to it, they
placed Gen. VVashington at the head of the deputation from that
State; and, as a proof of the deep interest he felt in the case, he
overstepped the obstacles to his acceptance of the appointment.”

§ 12. Congress took no action on the recommendation of the re-

port, until the legislature of New York instructed its delegation in

that body “to move a resolution, recommending to the several
States to appoint deputies to meet in Convention for the purpose
of‘ revising and proposing amendments to the Federal Constitution.”

ing of the executive powers. The power is expressly given to the

President in ‘the Constitution, by and with the advice and consent '

of the Senate, to appoint the judges of the Supreme Court; but
nothingvis said therein about the method of appointing the judges of
the inferior courts. There is no question, however, with regard to
the. judges of the circuit courts ; for they are judges of the Supreme
Court also. _i ’ _

§2. But whether the judges of the district courts, and the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, are inferior ofﬁcers, in
the Constitutional sense, so that Congress may provide for their
appointment, has never been settled by adjudication. But, thus
far,the uniform practice has been to ‘regard them not as inferior’
oﬁﬁcers ; but their appointments have been ‘made by the President,

withthe concurrence of the Senate, the same as‘ judges of the A

Supreme Court. The oath of office of all Federal judicial ofﬁcers
isithe same as that of officers of the other departments of govern-
ment. " P v T

§ 3. There are several reasons why the tenure of oﬂice of the

judges, should be made permanent and secure, depending only on

their good behavior. A
1st. That they may be independent and fearless in the discharge of
their responsible duties, it is necessary that they should hold

by the will of no man, or set of ihen. They must feel 

dependent on no earthly power for their continuance in otﬁce.

After appointment, were they in any manner dependent on
- executive, legislative, or popular favor, the scales of justice
might be doubtfully balanced, and conﬁdence in the judiciary
would be seriously disturbed. i ‘ '

2d.’ This independence could hardly be expected from judges who ‘

hold their oﬂices by a temporary tenure. Periodical appoint-
ments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would,

Pun: II.]   JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. o s 289

in some way or other, be fatal to their necessary independ-
ence. ‘ A ;
3d. If the power of making them were committed either to the
executive or legislature, there would be danger of an improp-
er complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if: to
both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeas-
»ure of either; if to the people, there would be too great a
disposition to consult popularity, to justify areliance that
‘nothing would be consulted but the Constitution and the
laws}

I § 4. The subject of removal of Federal ofﬁjcers by impeachment

has been fully ‘considered in other places in this work. The judges
of the Supreme and inferior ‘courts are subject to removal for
impeachable oﬁ°enses.- C ‘ C M t _

§ 5. Provision is wisely made, that, as the judge’s salary is at the

time he enters on the duties of his office, so it ‘shall’ continue to be

throughout his official existence, unless Congress shall see ﬁt to in-
crease it. In other Words, it can not be diminished. To allow the
legislative authority to diminish the salaries of the judges would be
to give that authority control over their support ; and to control their
support is to control. their will. A '

The salary of the chief justice is $6,500 a year‘; that of the asso-
ciate justices is $6,000 each. In the tenth circuit, constituted of
California and Oregon, the associate " justice has '$1,000A a year al-
lowed in addition to his salary, for traveling-expenses; 0

power of the national courts in the administration of justice. The 
word,_‘..‘ power ” refers to jurisdiction, or the authority-of’ the court,
over causes which must include the sulgjecyt-matter as well as the
parties concerned. V .- . .. v . ~

The subject-matter of a cause in. court is the.t7z2'ng or question»
to be decided: the pcmfies are the persons or corporations legally
interestedin the decision of the court on the subject-matter. .

§ 2’. The word “ law” is generally understood, as deﬁned by law- -
writers, to be the supreme power of the State, through its legisla-
ture, commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong. The
word ‘f equity,” as applied to judicialproceedings, does not mean con-
trary to law ; but it reachescases to which the law can not be applied
by reason of its universality. The object of equity jurisprudence
is to .supply the deﬁciencies of. the courts of law, and to render the
administration of justice more complete, by affording relief where the
courts of law, in consequence of imperfections of their machinery or
of their too’ rigid adherence to peculiar forms, are incompetent to
give it, or -to give it with effect}. ‘ . U. — ~ . ~

§  The judicial power of the United States extends to all cases -
of law and equityarising under the Constitution and laws thereof,
and to treaties made under their authority. But, there are two kinds '
of jurisdiction, original and appellate. .OrigiI1al jurisdiction is juris-
diction of a cause from its beginning.’ If a party can begin his .
suit in the circuit court, for instance, we say the circuit court has
original jurisdiction in the case. If »  can not bring his case into
that court until it has been -ﬁrst tried in some lower court, then we
say the circuit court has appellate jurisdiction. Some kinds of causes
can be commenced in either of two diﬁ"erent courts. Such courts,"
in such cases, are said to be courts of concurrent jurisdiction ; that
is, either court. has jurisdiction of such a cause. If there is but
one court in which. a case can be brought, that court is said, to have
exclusvive jurisdiction. The Supreme Court of the United States has
original or appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising. under the Con-
stitution and laws of the United States, and under treaties, as afore-
said.

§4. There are but two classes of cases in which the Supreme
Court of the United States has original jurisdiction : and these are,
ﬁrst, those affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls ;

and, second, those cases in which a State shall be a party. But, as will"

be seen by reference to the Analysis in this article, there are several
cases in which a State may be a party, either as plaintiff or defend-
ant. ’

§ 5. The ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, allud-
ed to, refer to those representing or acting for foreign governments.
By the lawof nations, these classes of oﬁicials are not amenable to
the laws of. the country to which they are accredited agents.. The

S country in which they reside is under obligation to protect them, and

their rights and privileges are regulated by the law of nations. -This
being the case, the national courts only should be allowed to take

, cognizance of matters affecting their interests, which should be

decided by the highest tribunal of the land.

§ 6. In controversies between two or more States, ‘there is no tri-S _

bunal before which there could be alpeaceable and impartial deter-
mination of questions, except the Federal courts. Of course, the

292 ANALYSIS OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART II.

courts of nei_ther of the States litigant could be regarded as disinter-

ested ; and they have no common judicatory between them.

-§ 7. -Controversies may arise between a State and the citizens of
a. neighboring State. ' It is manifestly more proper that the State
should prosecute’ its demands before a Federal court than to proceed
in the-courts of the State to which the defendants belong. The

State courts would be liable .to the charge of partiality, and job-
noxious to suspicion and censure, decide whichever way they might.

§ 8. Controversies arising between States of the Union and for-
eign States, citizens, or subjects, can more properly be referred to
the nationa_l courts than to the courts of the States interested as
parties. The decisions in all such cases ought to carry with them
that conﬁdence sure to beinspired by national authority.

_ ' § '9. The same reasons apply to controversies between the citizens

of a,State and foreign.States, citizens, or subjects.‘ In the course
of ‘complicated and extensive commercial transactions, foreigners or

foreign States may ﬁnd it necessary to appeal to our courts for re-

lief, or satisfaction. ,

. § 10. It must be_ noticed particularly, however, that no State can
be prosecuted by the citizens of another State, or a citizen of any
foreign State. TheiState may be plaintff against an individual,
_but can not be made defendant at the suit of a citizen of another
State, or a citizen of a foreign State. I _ p . ’_

It is inherent in the nature of ~ sovereignty not to be amenable to

the suit of ’ an individual without its consent. This is the general

sense and the general practice of mankind; and this exemption, as
one of the attributesof sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the govern-

ment of . everyState in the Union.1 _ '

§ 11. The Constitution gives the Supreme Court original juris-
diction in all cases in which a State shall be a party; and this was
construed during the ﬁrst few years after the adoption of the Con-
stitution to authorize ‘suits a-gainspt S_tates brought byindividuals.

,Many ,suits were brought to enforce claims held by individuals

against the States. This led to the adoption of the eleventh Article

1 Federalist, No.‘ 81.

PART II.] "JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. 293

of Amendments to the Constitution, paragraph 93 of that instru-
ment, which is in these words z—-- '‘ ' ‘ ' ‘

“ The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed
to extend to any suit in law. or equity commenced "or prosecuted
against one of the United States bycitizens of another State, or by
citizens or subjects of any foreign State.” -

§412. How is a person to obtain relief, then, in case he has a ‘

claim against a State? In the ﬁrst place, it is presumed that no
wisegovernment will withhold justice from its citizens. The citi-
zen to whom the State may be indebted can petition the legislature
direct for redress, unless some other means‘ have beeninstituted by
the State. In some of the States, courts of claims have been estab-
lished for the same purpose, into which the citizen can bring his
claim, by petition or otherwise, for adjudication’; and, if he shows
the State to be indebted to him, the legislature will make provision
for payment. _ I I

§ 13. In 1855, a court of claims was established, by act of Con-
gress, to hear and determine claims against the United States.
The demand is presented to the court by petition," setting forth

- speciﬁcally its origin and nature ; and the party is allowed to prove

it by the same rules of evidence that are usually adopted in courts
of justice. If a claim is established, Congress makes provision for
its payment.‘ An attorney, called the solicitor of the United States,
"appears in -behalf of the government before this court.

§ 14. These are all the cases in which the Supreme Courtof the
United States has or-igz7nal jurisdiction. And, as already "stated,
they are all included in two classes: ﬁrst,‘such as affect ambassadors,

other public ministers, and consuls; and, second, all those cases in

which a State shallibe a party.

§ 15. Whatiis meant by appellate jurisdiction has already been '

explained- By cases of admiralty andmaritime jurisdiction, refer-

. ence is had to the power to‘-try and determine, on appeal, all causes

originating on the high seas, or on rivers, ports, or harbors com-
municating with the sea, and out of the reach of ordinary courts
of justice. Admiralt-yncauses must arise wholly on the sea or on
waters immediately communicating with the sea, and not within

the _ jurisdiction of any country. On the high seas, all nations

claim a common right -and a common jurisdiction; and therefore
causes originating there shou.ld come exclusively under the juris-
diction of the national courts. They can not be brought, how-
ever, in the first instance, into the Supreme Court of the United
States, but may be appealed into that court after having been com-
menced and tried by a district court of the United States, which,
by a law of Congress, is an admiralty court. A , —

§ 16. -The subjects for adjudication which properly come into

‘courts of admiralty are, captures in war made on the high seas,

captures in foreign ports and harbors, captures. made on land by
naval forces, and captures made in the rivers, ports, and harbors
of’ the captor’s own country. If an American commissioned with
lettersof marque and reprisal shall make captures as aforesaid, it
is his duty to bring them into‘ the court for adjudication. If the
court shall decide that the things in controversy were 1awfully.-cap-
tured, and according to the usages of war and law of nations, they
are awarded to the captors. If the decision is that they were un-

lawfully seized, they will be awarded by the court to the owners
with damages for detention.

§'17. '' The ordinary admiralty and maritime -jurisdiction also
embraces all civil and criminal cases of a maritime nature. The
district courtssof the United States, however, as courts of admi-
raltyand maritime jurisdiction, are limited to the trial of crimes

fPAm:. IL] ' I JUDICIAL. ’DE_PA,RTMENT-   . 295

’ and offenses for which but moderate punishment is inflicted. C The
’ graver and higher crimes are referred to the bircuit courts as courts

of admiralty. 1 . V . .. . . _
' §718.. Controversies in which the United States shall be a party
are to be adjudicated .in the Federal courts. * Cases in which the

1 whole people are interested should not be left. to the decision "of a

State court.. The United States must bring suit, however, in the ﬁrst

. instance, in the inferior courts, -1-that is, in the district. orcircuit

-courts, —— and can not reach the Supreme Court except by appeal.

. § 20. By act of Congress, a citizen of one State may bring suit

‘against a citizen of another in the circuit court of the United States
in civil matters, provided the matter in controversy exceeds ﬁve hun-

dred dollars exclusive of costs. An alien may sue or be sued in

. thiscourt also for the same amount. And these courts have original

ju,risdiction also in matters relating to the United—States revenue and

i to copyriglits, being cases that arise under the laws of the United
, States. In all these cases, the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdic-

' tion only.

An appeal may be taken from the district court to the circuit court,

.and from the circuit to the Supreme Court, under certain restrictions

and limitations. -
§ 21. Controversies between citizens of the same State, claiming

‘lands under‘ grants of different States, must be adjudicated in the

United-States courts. State courts can not be supposed to be unbi-
ased in cases of this nature. , Claims to lands under grants of dif-

hferent S_5ate‘s, founded on adverse pretensions of. boundary, would

the time suggested in the report, “ for the purpose of revising the
Articles of Confederation, and reporting to Congress and the sev-
eral State legislatures such alterations and provisions therein, as
shall, when agreed to in Congress and conﬁrmed by the States,
render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of gov-
ernment and the preservation of the Union.”

§ 14. Public opinion was on the rapid march. Many events had

transpired, even after the appointment of commissioners to meet at
Annapolis, and before that Convention assembled, which matured

the popular judgment in favor of the proposition fora general Con- .

vention for the purposes set forth in the report.
§ 15. Still other events took place immediately after the Hamil-

ton report was. published, which still further demonstrated the neces- ‘

sity of such a Convention as was proposed therein. All were now
satisﬁed that the Union was in extreme danger. No calm, dispas-
sionateiobserver could ignore it.

§ 16. “ Among the ripening incidents,” says a prominent states-
man of that day, “ was the insurrection of Shays in Massachusetts
against her government, which was with difﬁculty suppressed, not-

withstanding the inﬂuence on the insurgents of an apprehended in~ .

terposition of the Federal troops”. '
§ 17. The insurrection above alluded to was led by one Daniel

Shays, who was followed by about two thousand insurgents, having _

for their object the open deﬁance and resistance of the laws under
which the taxes were to be collected and private obligations and
contracts to be enforced. It spread over several of the counties of
that State; and so formidable was it, that United-States troops were
called for to suppress it. But, by vigorous measures on the part of
the State, it was overcome." Several of the leaders were condemned
to death ; but, on account. of the popular sentiment in their favor, it
was deemed unwise to execute them. '

§ 18. The public debt, most of which had been contracted in the
sacred cause of liberty in the struggle for independence, remained
unpaid. Congress had made repeated calls on the States for pay-

ment: but these calls were either partially or wholly unheeded ,' one a

State expressly and openly refusing to take any step tending to its

April. 30, 1789 5 when the navy division Was established as a distinct

liquidation. The public mind was everywhere ﬁlled with gloom and
despondency.

' § 19. In reference to the embarrassments of commerce, Mr.
Madison says, "‘ The same want of a general power over com-
merce led to an exercise of the power separately by the States,
which not only proved abortive, but engendered rival, conflicting,
and angry regulations.” ' .

§ 20. “Besides the vain attempt to supply their respective treas-
uries by imposts, which turned their commerce into the neighboring
ports, and to coerce a relaxation of the British monopoly-of the West-
India navigation, which was attempted by Virginia, the States hav-
ing ports for foreign commerce taxed and irritated the adjoining
States, trading through them, as New York, Pennsylvania, Vir-
ginia, and South Carolina. Some of the States, as lonnecticut,
taxed imports from other States, as Massachusetts; which com-
plained in a letter- to the Executive of Virginia, and doubtless to
those of other States.” A -

§21. “In sundry instances, as of New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland, the navigation interests treated the
citizens of other States as aliens.” . . .

§22. “As a natural consequence of this distracted and dis-
heartening condition of the Union, the Federal authority had ceased
to be respected abroad ; and dispositions were shown there, particu-

larly in Great Britain, to take advantage of its imbecility, and to_
speculate on its approaching downfall. At home it had lost all .

conﬁdence and credit: the unstable and unjust career of the States
had also forfeited the respect and conﬁdence essential to order and
good government, involving a general decay of conﬁdence between
man and man.” -

§23. Under these distracting a.nd depressing inﬂuences, the
States had become favorable to the call from Annapolis to send
delegates to the proposed Philadelphia Convention, which convened
at the time appointed. There was by no means a full representa-
tion of the States, however; there being present but twenty-nine

delegates at the opening. ‘But, as there was good reason to believe-

that there would soon be a larger number, they proceeded to

PART I.] RATIEICATION OF CONSTITUTION. 29

CHAPTER XII.
RATIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.

“ § 1. THE new Constitution was now fairly beforethe people of
the United States. It met from the outset with very strong opposi-
tion; and the attacks were as various as the points of the compass.

§2. One class of objectors held that it gave too much power
into the hands of the Federal Crovernment; and another, that it did
not giveenough. P . A .

One maintained that the Senate should be elected for life ;
another, that six years was quite too long. One, that it should be
elected by the people; another, that it should be elected by the
Houseof Representatives. ‘ . I

Someheld that the terms of office generally were quite too long ;
others, that they were too short. _

§ 3. One class thought the President should be elected for life ;
one, for ten years ; one, for six ; and another, that he should be elected
annually. ,One class heldthat he ought to be elected by Congress;

" another, that he should be elected by direct vote of the people ; and

still another, that we could get along very Well without any Presi-
dent at all. ' , . . .

One class thought the Constitution invested the President with
too much power; and another, with too little. , _ V E _

§ 4. Similar objections were urged against the House of'.Repre.-
sentatives. Some were for having the members elected by electors
for that purpose appointed ; others, for having them elected by the
State legislatures. Some thought the term of two years too short;
others, too long. _ The objections against the judiciary were quite as
various and opposite. S _ I . .
. § 5. The storm raged with terrible political and personal violence
and asperity. Probably at no time_in the historyof this country
has party spirit run so high as at that time. Every feature of the
new plan of government was debated by the ablest minds of the day.
Profound statesmen were found in the ranks of opposition to the
Constitution, .-—- men whose patriotism, and purity of motive, could

30 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART I.

not be questioned. Even some of .the members of the Convention
that framed that document, able and inﬂuential members too, not
only refused to sign it for submission to the people, but went out
amongst their constituencies, and denounced it to the last.

§ 6. But the friends of the new Constitution ﬁnally triumphed.
Three States ratiﬁed it before tl1e close of the year 1787, and eight
more by the 26th of July, 1788; so that, in less than one year
from the time of its submission to the people, a sufficient number
of States had accepted it as the fundamental law of the land to
warrant the commencement of operations under it. '

§7. Sept. 13, 1788, Congress passed a resolution appointing
the ﬁrst VVednesday in January following for the choice of electors
of President of the United States; the ﬁrst Wednesday of Febru-
ary of the same year for the meeting of the electors to vote for that
officer ; and the ﬁrst Wednesday of March thereafter for commen-
cing proceedings under the Constitution at New York, which was
then the place of the meetings of Congress.

§ 8. Electors were accordingly appointed, and their votes given
for President. Elections of members of the House of Representa-
tives by the people, and for senators by the State legislatures, were
held; so that on VVednesday, the fourth day of March, 1789, the
ﬁrst Constitutional Congress met, and proceedings were commenced
under the new organization.

§ 9. In those days, travel was far more difﬁeult than in these later
days of railroad facilities. A quorum in Congress, therefore, did
not assemble until the 6th of April, at which time thetvotes for
President were counted ; and it was found that George Washington
was unanimously elected, having ‘received sixty-nine votes,--the
whole number. John Adams of Massachusetts was elected Vice’-
President ; receiving thirty-four votes, the next highest number.

§ 10. April 30, 1789, the President elect took the constitutional
oath of ‘office, it being administered. to him by the Chancellor of
the St-ate of New York; and the new government went into full
operation. A c S A

On the twenty-ﬁrst day of April, John Adams entered on his
duties as President of the Senate, and Vice-President of the United
States. ’ ~

7 CHAPTER XIII.
AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.

§ 1. THE chief design of this work, but for which it would not
have been vvritten, being the treatment of the Constitution by
.t0pz'cs, renders it necessary to refer, in this place, to the amend-
ments which have been made to that instrument. Indeed, to carry

32 ANALrs1s or CIVIL :GrOVERNMENT. [PART I.

out the design, no distinction can be made between the original
instrument and its amendments: they must all be treated as one
document in the Analysis, as they are in fact.

’§ 2. One of the strongest objections urged by its opponents

against the adoption of the Constitution as it came from the hands
_ of the Convention was, the want of a recognition of certain rights

of citizens, several of which have since been adopted as amendments
tothe Constitution. Those who were vehement in their opposition

to the ratiﬁcation of the instrument were emphatic in urging that it

ought to contain such a bill of rights as would insure individual
safety among the people. ’
§ 3. The people had been unused to a national government; that
could reach vindzmfduals ; that is, that could reach them dz'reclZyp_.-
for,‘ under the Confederation, the government was utterly powerless.
to punish. There was a popular clamor, therefore, for a compre-
hensive bill of rights. The people feared governmental encroach-
ments on individual rights. 2 .
§ 4. Most of the amendments to the Constitution were adopted
under this apprehension, and within a few years after the organiza-
tion of the new government. The Constitution contained provisions
for its own amendment; for its. illustrious authors never claimed
that it was by any means perfect. 0 V V
' § 5. At the first session of the ﬁrst Congress under the Constitu-
tion, therefore, held in New York, that bodypassed a resolution,
Sept. 25, 1789, two-thirds of‘ both houses concurring, proposing
to the legislatures of the severa1.States twelve articles of amendment
to the Constitution.
§-6. Ten of these articles» were ratiﬁed by the States in the fol-
lowing order, viz. : -4-‘ 9 9
NEW JERSEY, Nov. 20, 1789.
MARYLAND, Dec. 19, 1789....

NEW YORK, March 27, 1790.
RHODE ISLAND, June 15, 1790.
VERMONT, Nov. 3, 1791.
VIRGINIA, Dec. 15, 1791.
5§ 7. As the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States
concurred in the ﬁrst ten articles of amendment proposed, they be-
came validto all intent.s zfnd purposes as a" part of the Constitution
from Dec. 15, 1791. .
§ 8. The eleventh article of amendment was proposed by the
Third Congress at its first session, March 15, 1794. President
Adams declared in his message to Congress, Jan. 8, 1798, that it
had received the ratiﬁcation of the constitutional number of States,
and was therefore a part of the fundamental law of the land.
§ 9. The twelfth article. of amendment was proposed at the first
session of the Eighth Congress, Dec. 12, 1803, and received the rati-
ﬁcation of the requisite number of States during the following year,
and became part of the Constitution.
_§ 10. The thirteenth article of amendment was proposed at the
second session of the Thirty-eighth Congress, passing the Senate

April 8, 1864, and the House Jan. 31, 1865. William H. SeWard,1

Secretary of State, officially announced to the country, Dec. 18,

' 1805, that it had been ratiﬁed by three-fourths of the States, and

was therefore a part of the supreme law of the land}

CHAPTER XIV.
DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT.

. § 1. No free government can exist On earth, in which the admin-

istration of its powers and functions is not distributed. Let one
man have the power to make the laws, to interpret them, and to
execute the same, and that man will become a despot, and his gov-

ernment a despotism. Human nature must be made over anew, or.-
such a result must follow such an investment of authority in a single

individual.

.34 ANALYSISOF CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART I.

§ 2. If lthisconcentration of powers shall be extended to antin-
deﬁnite number of men, whether that number be few or many, the
character of the government will remain unchanged. One or more
persons might safely be trusted with either one of these ‘high pre-
rogatives ; but the danger consists in the concentration of all in the
same hands. A ‘ ' '

§ 3. All writers on free government agree, that the legislative,
the executive, and the judicial powers should be kept as separate
and distinct as possible. It is hardly possible, however, for human

wisdom to devise a plan by which they can be kept enzfz'reZg/ separate-

in the administration of government. _ .
§ 4. This has been attempted by the wisest and best of minds,

but has failed. Not one of all the American States has succeeded ;

though, in some instances, they may have done all that ﬁnite wisdom

{could accomplish. But in all cases, without a single exception,

there has been a partial mixture of these powers. .
§ 5. In several of the States, for instance, the Executive is elected
by the legislature, if no one receives a majority-vote by the people.
In one State he is elected by the legislature, without any attempt
at an election by the people.
In nearlyall of the States, the judicial oﬂcers are impeachable

by one or both branches of the legislature. In some of the States, -

the ofﬁcers of the judiciary are appointed by the governor and
the legislature, or one branch of that body.

I In others, the governor may veto any act passed by the legisla-
ture ; after which, in order that the act so vetoed may become a
law, it must be re—passed by a two-thirds majority of both houses.

In some States, the ‘judicial oﬁicers are elected by the people, but
removable on the address of one or both branches of the legislature.
In others, they are removable by one or both branches, on the ad
dress of the Executive. In still others, the judicial officers are
appointed by one or both branches of the legislature, and removable
by one branch on impeachment by the other.

§ 6. In fact, there is no such thing as a complete and absolute
separation of the three departments from each other. And all that
is intended,in speaking of the three ‘branches being kept separate

PART I.]   DECLARATION or mencrs. 35

and -distinct, is, that the powers. and du-ties properly belonging to any
one branch or department shall not ‘be interfered with or adminis-
tered -by either of the others ; that neither shall possess a controlling
inﬂuence over the others in the performance of their respective duties.
» I § 7. In order that there may be ofﬁcial independence, it is neces-
sary “that the legislative, executive, and judiciary powers shall
be kept as separate from, and independent of, each other, as the
nature of a free government will admit, or as is consistent with
that chain of connection that binds the whole fabric of the Consti-
tution in one_indissoluble bond of unity a_nd amity.”

§ 8. The Constitution of the United States aims to separate the
three departments as widely as possible, and to render them as inde-

pendent, the one of the others, as the complicated nature of the

subject will permit. The government of the United States is a
represeoztatrive government; and there is far less danger to liberty
arising from the partial mixture of these powers in this country,

than in a government of less direct responsibility to the people.

I.

THE following is the Declaration of Rights made by the ﬁrst Con-
tinental Congress, Oct. 14, 1774, ——i nearly two years before the
Declaration of Independence. But it was not difficult to foresee
that separation from the mother country was imminent, unless Great
Britain or the_Colonies should take animmediate backward step.
Indeed, this Declaration of Rights foreshadowed the Declaration of
Independence.

DECLARATION or RIGHTS.

I WHEREAS, since the close of the last war, the British Parliament,

claiming a power of right to bind the people of America by statutes .

in all cases whatsoever, hath, in some acts, expressly imposed taxes
on them, and in others, under various pretenses, but in fact for the
purpose of raising a revenue, hath imposed rates and duties paya-

ble in these Colonies, established. a board of commissioners with
unconstitutional powers, and extended the jurisdiction of admiralty,
not only for collecting the said duties, but for the trial _of causes
merely arising Within the body of a county ;

And whereas, in consequence of other statutes, judges, who
before held only estates at will in their offices, have been made
dependent on the Crown alone for their salaries, and standing armies
kept in time of peace; and whereas, it has lately been resolved
in Parliament, that, by force of a statute made in the thirty-ﬁfth
year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth, colonists may be trans-
ported to England, and tried there upon accusations for treasons, and
misprisions or concealments of treasons, committed in the Colonies,
and by a late statute such trials have been directed in cases therein
mentioned ;

And whereas, in the last session of Parliament, three statutes
were made, ———one entitled an “ Act to discontinue, in such manner
and for such time as are therein mentioned, the Landing and Dis-
charging, Lading or Shipping, of Goods, VVares, an_d Merchandise at
the. Town and within the Harbor of Boston, in the Province of Mas-
sachusetts Bay, in New England; ” and another statute was then
made, “ for Making more Effectual Provisions for the Government
of the Province of Quebec,” 850., — all which statutes are impolitic,
unjust, and cruel, as well as unconstitutionahand most dangerous
and destructive of American rights ; »

And whereas, assemblies have been frequently dissolved, contrary
to the rights of the people, when they attempted to deliberate on
grievances; and their dutiful, humble, loyal, and reasonable peti-
tions to the Crown for redress have been repeatedly treated with
contempt by his majesty’s ministers of State ;

The good people of the several Colonies of New Hampshire, Mas-
sachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connec-
ticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Castle, Kent and

Sussexon Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South
Carolina, justly alarmed at these arbitrary proceedings of Parliament ‘
and Administration, have severally elected, constituted, and appointed

deputies to meet and sit in General Congress, in the cityof Phila-

delphia, in order to obtain such establishment as that their religion,
laws, and liberties may not be subverted. VVhereupon the deputies
so appointed, being now assembled in a full and free representation
of these Colonies, taking into their most serious consideration the
best means of attaining the ends aforesaid, do in the ﬁrst place, as
Englishmen, their ancestors, in like cases have usually done, for
affecting and vindicatin g their rights and liberties, DECLARE, —-
That the inhabitants of the English Colonies in North America, by
the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English Consti-
tution, and the several charters or compacts, have the following
RIGHTS : —— .p
' Resolved, N. C. D.,1 1. That they are entitled to life, liberty, and

property; and they have never ceded to any sovereign power what-‘

ever a right to dispose of either without their consent.

Resolved, N. C. D., 2. That our ancestors, who ﬁrst settled these
Colonies, were, at the time of their emigration from the mother
country, entitled to all the rights, liberties, and immunities of free
and natural born subjects within the realm of England.

Resolved, N. C. D., 3. That, by such emigration, they by no
means forfeited, surrendered, or lost any of those rights; but that
they were, and their descendants now are, entitled to the exercise
and enjoyment of all such of them as their local and other circum-
stances enable them to exercise and enjoy. a , ‘

Resolved, 4. That the foundation of English ‘liberty, and of all
free government, is a right in the people to participate in their
legislative council; and as the English colonists are not represented-,
and from their local and other circumstances can not properly be
represented, in the British Parliament, they are entitled to a free
and exclusive power of legislation in their several Provincial legisla-
tures, where their right of representation can alone be preserved, in

all cases of taxation and internal polity, subject only to thenegative

of their sovereign, in such manner‘ as has been heretofore used and
accustomed.’ But from the necessity of the case, and a regard to

the natural interests of both countries, we cheerfully consent to the

. 1 vAbbr.eviations.for nemine contradicente; signifying, no one opposing.

operation of such acts of the British ~ Parliament as are bond fide.
restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the pure
pose of securing the commercial advantages of the Whole empire to.

the mother country, and the commercial beneﬁts of its iespective
members; excluding every idea of taxation, internal or external,
for raising a revenue on the subjects in America Without their con-
sent.

Resolved, N.  D., 5. That the respective Colonies are entitled

to the common law of England, and more especially to the great

and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicin-
age according to the course of that law. - V
_ Resolved, 6. That they are entitled to the beneﬁt of such of. the

’,English statutes as existed at the time of their colonization, and
Which they have, by experience, respectively found to be applicable

to their several local and other circumstances. —

Resolved, N. C. D., 7. That these, his Majesty’s Colonies, are
likewise entitled to all the immunities and privileges granted and
conﬁrmed to them by royal charters, or secured by their several
codes of Provincial laws.

Resolved, N. C. D., 8. That they have a right peaceably to
assemble, consider of their grievances, and petition the king; and
that all prosecutions, prohibitory proclamations, and commitments
for the same, are illegal. ~

_ Resolved, N. C. D., 9. That the keeping a standing army in
these Colonies in times of peace, Without the consent of the legisla-
ture of that Colony in which such army is kept, is against law. _

Resolved, N. C. D., 10. It is indispensably necessary to good
government, and rendered essential by the English Constitution,
that the constituent branches of the legislature be independent of
each other ; that, therefore, the exercise of legislative power in sev-
eral Colonies by a council, appointed during pleasure by the Crown,
is unconstitutional, dangerous, and destructive to the freedom of
American legislation. ’ '

. All and each of which the aforesaid deputies, in behalf of them-
selves and their constituents, do claim, demand, and insist on, as
their indubitable rights and liberties, which can not be legally" taken

from them, altered, or abridged, by any power whatever, without their

own consent, by their representatives in their several Provincial
legislatures.

I In the course of our inquiry, we ﬁnd many infringements and
violations of the foregoing rights ; which, from an ardent desire that
harmony and mutual intercourse of affection and interest may be
restored, we pass over for the present, and proceed to state such acts
and measures as have been adopted since the last war, which demon-
strate 'a system formed to enslave America. ‘ -

Zi'esoZved,iN. C. D., That the following acts of Parliament are

infringements and violations of the rights of the colonists ; and that

i the repeal of them is essentially necessary, in order to restore har-

mony between Great Britain and the American Colonies; viz. :-—
The several acts of 4 Geo. III. ch. 15 and ch. 34, 5 Geo. III.
ch. 25, 6 Geo. III. ch. 52, 7 Geo, III. ch. 41 and ch. 46, 8 Geo.

III. ch. 22, which impose duties for the purpose of raising a revenue

in America, extend the power of the admiralty courts beyond their

ancient limits, deprive the -American subject of trial by jury, author-
ize the judges’ certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages
that he might otherwise be liable to, requiring oppressive security
from a claimant of ships ‘and goods seized before he shall beallowed
to defend his property, and are subversive of American rights.

Also 12 Geo. III, ch. 24, entitled “ An Act for the Better Secur-
ing his Majesty’s Dock-Yards, Magazines, Ships, Ammunition, and
Stores,” which declares a. new offense in America, and deprives the
American subject of a constitutional trial by jury of the vicinage,
by authorizing the trial of any person charged with the committing
any offense described in the said act, out of the realm, to be indicted
and tried for the same in any shire or county within the realm._

Also the three acts passed in the last session‘ of ' Parliament, for
stopping the port and blocking up the harbor of Boston, for altering
the charter and government of Massachusetts Bay, and that which
is entitled “ An Act for the Better Administration of Justice,” 850.

Also the act passed in the same session for establishing the Roman-
Catholic religion in the Province of Quebec ; abolishing the equitable
system of English laws, and erecting a tyranny there, ‘to the great

danger (from so total a dissimilarity‘ of religion, law, and govern-
ment) of the neighboring British Colonies,»by the assistance of

-Whose blood and treasure ‘the said country was conquered from

France.

i’Also the act passed in the same session, for the better providing,

suitable quarters for oﬁcers and soldiers in his Majesty’s service
in North America.

Also that the keeping a standing army in several of these Colo-_
nies in time of peace, Without the consent of the Legislature of that

Colony in which such army is kept, is against law.

To these grievous acts and measures Americans can not submit;-‘

but in hopes their fellow-subjects in Great -Britain will, on a revision

of them, restore us to that state in which both countries found hap-
piness and prosperity, We have,-for the present, only resolved to
pursue the following peaceable measures: 1. To enter into a non-

importation, non-consumption, and non-exportation agreement or
association; 2. To prepare an address to the people of Great
Britain, and a memorial to the inhabitants of British America ; and,

3. To prepare a loyal address to his Majesty, agreeable to resolu-

tions already entered into.

PART 1.] DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. 41

VVe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created

‘equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalien-
able rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of Q

happiness ; that, to secure these rights, governrnents are instituted
among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the gov-
erned ; that, whenever any form of government becomes destructive
of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and
to institutca new government, laying its foundation on such princi-

“ ples, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem

most likely to effect their safety and happiness. . Prudence, indeed,
will dictate that governments should not be changed for light and
transient causes ; and, accordingly, all experience hath shown that
mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than
to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accus-.
tomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw
oﬁ" such government,-and to provide new guards for their future
security. S_u_ch has been the patient suﬁerance of these Colonies,
and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
former systems of government. The history of the present king
of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations,
all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny
over these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid
world :_—— A i ,
He has refused his assent to ‘laws the most wholesome and neces-
sary for the public good. _ ' _ g . a
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and
pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his
assent should be obtained ; and, when so suspended, he has utterly
neglected to attend to them. - _ 
. He has refused to pass other lawsfor the accommodation of large
districts of. people, unless those. people would relinquish the right
of representation in the Legislature; a right inestimable to them,
and formidable .to tyrants only. > t A
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncom-

42 ANALYSIS on CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART I.

fortable, and distant from the depository of their publicirecords, for
the sole purpose of fatiguing; them _into compliance with his

measures. ._   . - _ .
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing,

With manly ﬁrmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.

a He has refused,for a longtime after such disselutions, to cause

. others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of

annihilation, have returned to the people‘ at large for their exercise ;
the State remaining, in the mean time, exposed to all the danger of
invasion from without, and convulsions Within.

He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States ; for
that purpose, obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreign’-
ers ; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and
raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.

He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his
assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.

« _He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure
of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. '

He has erected a multitude of new ofﬁces, and sent hither swarms
of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, With-
out the consent of our Legislature. H ' . V

He has affected to render the military independent of, and
Superior to, the civil power. . -

He has combined, with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction
foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws ; giv-
ing his assent to their acts of pretended legislation, ———- s

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us ;

For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any
murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these
States; -

For cutting off our trade with all parts of the World ;
» Forimposing taxes on us Without our consent ;

For depriving us, in many cases, of .the beneﬁts of trial by jury;
_ For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended of-
fenses ; ' i

PART 1.] DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. 43

For abolishing the free system of ‘English laws in a neighboring

Province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlar-

ging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and ﬁt
instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these
Colonies; r i

For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws,
and altering fundamentally the powers of our governments ;

For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves
invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever ;

He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his
protection, and waging war against us. -

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns,
and destroyed the lives of -our people.-

. ‘He is, at this time,'transporting large armies of foreign merce-
naries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny,
already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perﬁdy scarcely
paralleled in the most barbarous ages," and totally unworthy the
head of a civilized nation. . -

He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high
seas to bear arms against their country, to become the execution-
ers of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their
hands. _ _

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has
endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merci-
less Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistin-
guished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.

In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for
redress in ‘the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have
been answered only by repeated injury. A prince whose charac-
ter is thus marked by every act which may deﬁne a tyrant is unﬁt
to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren.

‘We have , warned them, from time to time, of attempts made by
their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.

,We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration

and settlement here. VVe ‘have appealed to their native justice and

44.   ANALYSIS OE CIVIL GOVERNMENT. [PART I. 1

magnanimity; and We have conjured them, by the ties of our
common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which Would
inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They,
too, have_been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity.’ VVe
must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our
separation, and hold them, as We hold the rest of mankind, enemies
in War; in peace, friends. _ , I

We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of
America, in GENERAL CONGREss assembled, appealing to the
Supremedudge Of the World forthe rectitude of our intentions,
do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of these
Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies
are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States; that
they are. absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown ,- and that
all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain
is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as FREE AND INDE-
PENDENT STATES, they have full power to levy War, conclude peace,
contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and
things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. . .And‘for the
support of this declaration, with a ﬁrm reliance on the protection of
DIVINE PROVIDENCE, we mutually pledge to each other our lives,
ourfortunes, and our sac-red honor. ’ T ‘ ’

PREFACE.

THE analytic method of this work furnishes its chief p

claim to superiority over others as a text-book on civil
government. The Constitution of the United States is
our fundamental law. To understand this well is to under-
stand the whole theory; and to analyze this is to analyze
the entire American system.

The principal aim, therefore, of this work is to present
analytically the subject of civil government as adminis-
tered in this country. » ~ » v

The living, earnest teacher of to-day insists on a critical
analysis of Whatever subject he brings into the class-room.
This has been the tendency of his profession for several
years. A general acquaintance with miscellaneous and
scattered facts bearing on his subject does not satisfy. He
must get inside of things, and take his pupil with him.

N 0 work has been published, known to the author, pre-
tending to give a topical and tabular arrangement of the
principles of "our government. Several authors have
written with ability on civil government, having direct
reference to the wants of the schoolroom ; but they have
not satisﬁed the instructor. Whether the present attempt
shall add one more to the list of failures, time and the
teacher will tell.

The Constitution of the United States consists of a com-

bination of powers granted and powers f97‘0}l’iZ)?iL‘6d.f. Each

of‘-these classes of powers is divisible into general topics

Sta, -—We have now the honor to submitpto the consideration of
the United States in Congress assembled that Constitution which
hasappeared to us the most advisable. ' —

P.  The friends of 7 our country have long ‘seen and desired thatthe

power of making war, peace, and treaties, that of levying money
and regulating commerce, and the correspondent executive and ju-

» dicial authorities, should be fullyand effectually vested in the ‘Gen-
eral ‘Government of the Union. ,-’B_lp1,t the-impropriety of -delegating.

PART I.] “ ‘RESOLUTIONS or‘- CONVENTION. 7 7

such extensive ''trust' to ‘one bodyof men ‘is ‘evident : -hence ‘results
the necessity of a diﬂerent organization. I

It is obviously impracticable, in the Federal Government-of these
States, to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and
yet provide for the interest and safety of all. Individuals entering

itnrto Society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest.

The magnitude of the sacriﬁce must depend aswellv on situationand

circumstance as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times * dif-

ficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which
must be surrendered and those which ‘may be reserved 5 and, on the
present occasion, this difficulty was increased by a difference among
the several States as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular
interests. _ I ‘ ‘ ' A ‘p

In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our

view that which appears to ‘usethe greatest interest of every true
‘American, —,-the ‘consolidation of our Union, —— in which is involved
our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps our national existence. This

important consideration, seriously and deeply impressed on ‘our

‘minds, led each State in the Convention’? to beless rigid on points of
_ inferior magnitude than might have been otherwise expected ; and

thus the ‘Constitution which we now" present is the result. of “a.

‘spirit of amity, andof that mutual deference and concession which

the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable;
‘That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every State,

"is not,'perhaps, to be expected; but each will doubtless consider,

that, had her interest been alone consulted, the consequences might
have been particularly dis_a_greeable or injurious to others. That it
is liable "to as few exceptions as could reasonably have_been ex-
pected, ‘we hope and believe ; that it may promote theiilasting ‘wel-
ifaredof that country so dear to -us all, and secure her freedom and
happiness,'is ourmost ardentwish.‘ C ’   " , ' _
Witli great respect," we have the honor -to be, sir, your Excellen-

icy’s most obedient, humble servants.

PREFACE. , 5

1 branch. The sub-titles at the extreme right, or several of

them, may be divided also. Take, for instance, ELIGIBILI-
TY. Its conditions are, 1st, Age ; 2d,Citizenship; 8d, In-
habitancy; 4th, Official Disencumbrance. Also SENATE
POWERS: 1st, Legislative; 2d, Executive; 3d, Elective;
4th, Judicial.

Thus all the elements of kindred signiﬁcance are grouped
together in onetable, under one common and appropriate
title. For this purpose, paragraphs, sections, and clauses,
Whefiever necessary, are severed from their original con-
nections in the Constitution. Indeed, very little attention
is paid to theoriginal arrangement ‘of the subjects of that
document. The preceding example Will give the teacher
an idea of the manner in which lessons may be given by
topics. _

Exha.ustively grouping the sections and clauses of the
Constitution itself‘ must necessarily make thorough Work:

at every step. Every element of the main subject, even

to critical minuteness, will be clearly comprehended by the
pupil. He will experience the scholarly satisfaction also,
that-something is completed every lesson.

In the tabular arrangement of the sections and clauses
of the Constitution, nothing is omitted or added; and, as
far as possible, the precise language of that instrument is
retained. ,

Familiar and critical explanations of the Analysis, topic
by topic, in the order of their arrangement, are given
according to the views of the most eminent Writers on con-
stitutional laW. Very little or no claim is laid by the
author to originality of construction. In this, he acknowl-
edges his entire indebtedness to the illustrious men Who
formed the Constitution, as their views appear in the

‘Madison Papers and the Federalist; and to the profound
