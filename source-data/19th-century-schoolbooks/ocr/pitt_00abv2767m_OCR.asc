There is a class of bodies that have a higher
kind of life than plants. They
have feeling.  They can move       r           
Animals have eyes with,   
which they see, ears with which
they hear, lungs with which  |3
they breathe, etc.  Eyes, ears,
and lungs, are organs.  Animals, therefore, like plants, are,
organic bodies.
Some of the lower animals, I  
as the cow an  the horse, live
with man and are under his S
control.  These are known as
domestic animals.  Others live

in an untamed state, and are. Alligator
called wild animals. The deer,
the wolf, and the panther, are wild animals.
The cat and the dog are two of the commonest
domestic animals. Both have claws and teeth
* NOTE.-This section on animals may be made interesting
by oral lessons, in which the facts should be drawn out as far
as possible by the pupil's own observation. In every case the
idea should be developed before the scientific name is applied.
The class may finally be required to assign to the proper
division different animals with which they are acquainted.
suitable for tearing flesh. We call such animals
Car-niv'o-ra (flesh-eaters).
Other domestic animals do not eat flesh, but
live on vegetable food. The cow and the horse
are examples of these. They lack the sharp teeth
of the carnivora, and instead of claws they have
hoofs.  We call them  Un'gu-lates (hoofed animals).
Birds are another class of animals. Let us
compare some bird (a goose, for example) with
a dog. Their parts agree in number, but differ in form. The mouth of the goose is in the
form of a bill. The goose has two ears, but they
do not stand out from the head like the dog's
ears. It has a neck, but this neck is much
longer than the dog's. Its front limbs are wings,
and not legs. Its body is covered with feathers,
instead of hair.
REPTILES.
Hawk-bill Turtle. 3. Lizard. 4. Rattlesnake. 5. Horned Toad.
Consult Packard's "ZoSlogy," p. 488.
Snakes belong to another class of animals.
The snake has no legs, but it moves rapidly by
bending its long, slender body. Snakes, lizards,
turtles, etc., are called Reptiles.
Fish form another class of animals. The carnivora, ungulates, birds, reptiles, and fishes, all
have a backbone, or ver'tebral column.  Hence
they are all included under the general name of
VERTEBRATES.

WRITTEN EXERCISE. - Comzplete the following: The two
largest divisions of land in the world are called. The
Western Continent lies in the  ~ Hemisphere; it is made
up of -    and -. The Eastern Continent lies in the
Hemisphere; it consists of -, ---, and. The sixth
Grand Division, named -, does not belong to either continent. It is made up of    and other islands.
We live in the -    Continent and the    Hemisphere.
The map of the - Hemisphere shows the opposite side of
the world from that on which we live. The Equator looks like
a --  line, but it is really a circle; half of it is in the
Hemisphere, and half in the. It crosses three Grand
Divisions; namely, -. The Arctic Circle crosses -,  
and. The-    Circle does not cross any of the Grand
Divisions.
The Torrid Zone embraces the     part of North America, the -    part of South America, the greater part of-,
the -   part of Asia, and the -- part of Australia. The
only difference between a continent and an island is that
There is nearly three times as much water as
land on the earth's surface.
The five oceans-the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian,
Arctic, and Antarctic-all connected together, are
really but parts of one great body of water, which
surrounds all the divisions of land, and which may
be-called "' the Ocean".
THE EARTH AS A WHOLE.
LESSON LXXXVI.
We have  visited  the  different parts of the
earth; let us now look at the earth as a whole.
I. Shape. -The earth is round like a ball.
2. Size.  The distance round this ball is about
25,000 miles.  If a railroad could
be built round the earth, the fastest train would take thirty days and
nights to make the circuit once.
3. Motions.-The earth seenms to
stand still, but it moves.
4. Pass a wire through  a ball,
and move the ball round  on the
wire from  west to east.   This is
one way in which the earth moves.,,
5. The wire represents what is
called the Axis of the earth.  The
earth turns on its axis.                BIRD-OF-PARAI
The ends of the axis are the Poles. The north
end is the North Pole; find it on the map of each
hemisphere. The south end is the South Pole;
find it on the map of each hemisphere.
6. Draw a large circle on the floor. Place a
lighted lamp at the center.  Move a ball along
the circle, round the lamp. This is another way
in which the earth moves. The lamp represents
the sun.  The earth revolves round the sun.
Illustrate the earth's motions with a globe.
7. Latitude and Longitude (refer to pp. 54, 63).
-The Equator encircles the earth midway between the poles. Latitude is reckoned north and
south from the Equator.
Some Meridian, reaching from pole to pole, is
fixed upon, from which longitude is reckoned east
and west. Sometimes two meridians are used, as
in the maps in this book.  The longitude from
the meridian of Greenwich (grin'ij), a place near
London, is given at the top of the maps; and the
longitude from Washington, the capital of the
United States, is given at the bottom.
8. The Zones (p. 54), differing from each other
in heat, differ also in their vegetation, their animals, and the character of their inhabitants.
9. Vegetation.-The Frigid Zones have but a
scanty vegetation during their brief summer, in
many parts none at all. The Temperate Zones
are best adapted to the grains.  The Torrid Zone
produces the most luxuriant herbage, the densest
forests, the richest growths with the least labor
to man.
Both climate and productions are affected by
the elevation above sea-level. If
we ascend a high mountain in the
Torrid Zone, we shall find the vege-'   tation become less and less tropical, till it resembles that of the
Temperate, and finally that of the
Frigid, Zones.
io. Animals.-The Frigid Zones
have the largest tenants of the waters whales, walruses, and seals.
The domestic animals flourish best
/    in the Temperate Zones. The larSE--LYRE-BIRD.   gest and fiercest wild animals-the
98
--I- -- ------
DISTHE ZONES CONTRASTED.
lion, tiger, elephant, rhinoceros, etc.-are found
in or near the tropical regions; also the most
venomous serpents, and the birds of mlost beautiful plumage.  Such are the bird-of-paradise,
a native of the East Indian islands, and the
lyre-bird of Australia, shown at the bottom of
page 98.  The engraving above represents the
vegetable and the animal life of the different
zones in contrast. Name the several zones in the
picture.  What animals are shown in each?
I i. The Inhabitants of the Temperate Zones
take the lead in industry, enterprise, and mental
power.  The nations of the white race are the
most advanced in civilization.
12. Besides the white race just spoken of, which
prevails in southwestern Asia, Europe, and America, there are four others. These are the negro
or black race, of which Africa is the chief home;
the yellow race of Asia (embracing also the Esquimaux), represented by the Chinese and Japanese; the copper-colored race, of which you may
have seen specimens in our American Indians;
and the browm race, scattered through many of
the islands of Oceania.

For the pupil to read.
Plants and animals have life and grow.  But
rock does not grow. A rock can not move of it
self. If I strike a rock, it does not feel the blow
A rock has no life.
There is no life in a lump of coal, or in a piec{
of slate, or in sand, or in clay, or in iron.  Non(
of these have organs by means of which they cai
see, or breathe, or digest food.  We call them in
organic bodies; and we group such inorgani(
bodies together under the name of Minerals.
Coins are made of gold, silver, and copper
Nails are made of iron.  Shot is made of lead.
Pins are coated with tin. Gold, silver, copper,
iron, lead, and tin, all have a peculiar luster
They and other similar substances are classed
together as iffetals. All metals are minerals.
Of the metals just named, gold and silver are
the most valuable. They are called the Precious
Metals.  Iron is the most useful metal.
Iron lies beneath the surface; to get it out,
pits or mines are dug in the earth. The iron, as
brought out from the mines, is usually combined
or mixed with other matter, and is then called
ore.  Many other minerals are obtained from
mines.
QUESTIONS ON THE ENGRAVING.
Turn to the picture on p. I2. What do you see in the
side of the hill on the left? That dark opening is the enitrance to an iron-mine. What do you see on the road leading
a   from the mine?  Describe the furnace at the bottom of the
-  hill.
In this furnace the ore is to be smelted (melted); the iron
is thus separated from the matter with which it was united.
e   What is the stream that is issuing from an opening in the
furnace? How has the iron been made liquid?  The molten
e   iron is received in sand-molds, consisting of long trenches
n   with shorter cross-trenches leading from them. These are
called the " sow and pigs," and iron thus cast is called "pigC   iron."  How many pigs do you see cast or partly cast in the
picture?.  Minerals differ from plants and animals in that
they are inorganic bodies and have no life. They
include the earths, rocks, metals, etc.  The Precious Metals are gold and silver.
i  RITTEN EXERCISE.-Coinplete the following: Different objects around us may be classified as vegetable, animal, or
mineral. To the vegetable division belong --  --,  and
J  -:.  I belong to the division of --. I will write the
S  names of all the minerals I can call to mind:
Iron is a -; it belongs to the division of --.  Many
useful articles are made of iron; for instance, -.  Iron
comes out of -   in the form of -, which is smelted in, with the aid of another -   called coal.
Consult Pepper's " Playbook of Metals," p. 355.
NOTE. --The teacher may at
this point devote several oral lessons to a consideration of the
County. Supplementing the pupil's knowledge from a local map,
I,. Draw an outline of the
county on any convenient scale.
The teacher may lead on the blackboard, while the class follow on
their slates.
2. Give the reliefs and drainage
-the hills, mountains, streams,
and lakes, inserting in the map
each as it is named.
3. Bring out by questions what
_ ~~                 the pupil knows about the climate, productions, animals, and
minerals, supplying such information as he needs.
4. Locate the county-seat, cities, and villages.
5. Locate the railroads and canals.
6. Teach how to bound the county, inserting the names of
the adjoining counties as they are mentioned.

I2X. OCCUPATIOXS OF MEN.
For the pupil to read.
There are different ways of making a livingdifferent occutpactions, as they are called.
Many till the soil; these are known as Farmers.
It would not do to depend on wild plants for
food.  Grain must be cultivated, in order that we
may have bread. So the farmer plows the ground
and plants his seed.  Then, after a while, when
the crop has ripened, he harvests it.
Tilling the soil is called Agriculture.
Many farmers make hay, to feed to their livestock in  winter.   Their  live-stock  consists of
horses, mules, cattle, sheep, and hogs. Their
cattle furnish beef for market, their sheep mutton, and their hogs pork. From cows they get
milk, which may be made into butter or cheese.
That part of farming which has to do with
milk, butter, and cheese, is called Dairying.
The farmer raises grain; but grain must be
made into flour, and flour into bread.  Here we
have new  occupations.  Turning the raw  material, like grain, into useful articles, like bread, is
called Xanufacturing.
One manufacturer saws logs into boards, and
another makes the boards into furniture.  One
manufacturer extracts iron  from  the ore, and
others make the iron into nails, stoves, screws,
knife-blades, needles, and various other articles.

NOTE.--It will be well for teacher and pupils together to
visit such mills, factories, or shops, as may be near at hand,
and to observe the processes by which different things are
made. The knowledge thus gained should be extended by
means of oral explanations and descriptions found in books,
till the pupils have clearly defined ideas of the ways of making cotton, woolen, and linen goods, clothing, leather, paper,
books, boots and shoes, houses, etc.
Q3For the pupil to read.
The farmer raises more grain than he  
for himself.  The manufacturer makes
wares than he can use.  Now, if they cam
change products with each other -if the fa
can give some of his grain to the manufact
and receive manufactured articles in retur
will benefit both.
But a direct exchange would cost too i
time and trouble. So
there  are  men  who
make it a business to
buy what others have
to sell, and to keep for
sale what others need
to  buy.   These  men
are called  merchants.
Buying  and  selling,           / -
and  the  exchange  of
goods, constitute what,
is called Commerce.  
Besides agriculture,            r
manufactures,  and
commerce, there are various other occupations.  
Mien are engaged in                 "
obtaining coal and metallic  ores from  the
earth, which is called:
mining; in getting out
stone, which is called
quarrying; in fishing;                /;,
in pursuing and killing
wild animals, or hunting; and in procuring.
timber from the forest,,
or lumbering.
There  are, also,
many clergymen, law-

XI. GO FEtRX[JlsT.-RELIGIOsC'.
For the pupil to read.
In every school there are rules which the pupils must obey. If the pupils are allowed to do
as they choose, they may not learn much. There
must be Government in school.
Some of the rules to be observed in school are
made by the teacher; others are made by the
School Board or School Officers.  The teacher
sees that the rules are obeyed. The governing
power is in the teacher's hands.
So in a city or a village there must be government; there are laws which the people must obey.
Most cities are larger than villages, but it is
not size that makes the difference between a city
and a village. A city is invested with certain
rights which a village does not possess.  A  city
is governed by a Mayor, as chief officer, and by a
City Council, a Common Council, or a Board of
Aldermen, by which body the laws are made.
The  mayor, and  councilmen  or aldermen, are
elected by the people.
When a person is charged with a crime, he is
tried in court.  Every county has a county-seat
or shire-town, in which  courts are held.  The
county-seat contains the Court-House, in which
the court meets, and the Jail, where criminals
are confined.  Many counties have a Poor-house,
where poor people are cared for at the public expense.
There are few  neighborhoods in which we can
go very far without seeing a chulrch, or building
in which people meet to worship God. Some
churches  are  Protestant, others  are  Catholic.
Both Catholics and Protestants believe in Christ
and the Bible.  They profess the Christian Religion.
The Jews do not receive the whole Bible as the
word of God; they acknowledge the Old Testament only.  They reject Christ as the MIessiah.
Their religion is called the Jewish.
There are other religions in other lands.

XII. COYDITIOnS OF SOCIETY.
For the pupil to read.
People in different parts of the world are in
very different conditions.  All have not the same
comforts that we enjoy.  We have plenty of food
and clothing, honses, railroads, steamboats, books,
nevwspapers, and schools. We have a government
that protects all in their rights.
People wvho have these advantages, who are
kindly toward their neighbors, who follow regular occupations, and who try to advance and improve, are said to be Civilized.
There are others who are poorly clothed and
fed, and have no regular occupations except
hunting and fishing.  They have no schools,
and do not wish to learn.  They are fierce and
cruel, and take delight in wnar. These are called
Savctge.
Others, again, a little above the savages, rove
from place to place, living on the products of
their flocks and herds. They dwell in huts or
tents, btt have no books or schools, and only a
few rude manufactures.  These are called Barbaronts.
A class of people higher than the barbarous
till the soil in a rude way, and manufacture many
articles by hand or simple machinery. They have
some learning, and are not ignorant of the arts.
These are called Half-civilized.
Questions on the Engravin.--Turn to p. I6. What do you
see on the left of the engraving? Do rude nations build railroads, telegraphs, libraries, or school-houses? What do these
things indicate? How is the condition of a people bettered
by railroads?  By telegraphs? By libraries?  By schools?
What do we call nations that have advantages like these?
What other advantages have Civilized nations?
What do you see on the right of the engraving?  Are
these people civilized?  What makes you think so?  Are
they as comfortable as civilized people?  When men live
miserably in caves or huts, supporting themselves on what
they can find in the woods, what do we call their condition?
Of what is the Savage condition the opposite? Do we find
great cities among savage people?  Why not?  What things
that you might see in a strange country, would make you think
the inhabitants civilized-and what, savage?
What do you see in the two middle pictures of the engraving? Which shows the higher condition? Do you see in
either any great marks of progress? What do we call these
conditions? How do the Half-civilized and the Barbarous condition rank, as compared with the Civilized and the Savage?
Name the four conditions of society in order, beginning at
the highest. In which condition will people be most likely to
take care of the poor and sick, to make inventions and improvements, to become great and powerful?  In which condition are people most likely to suffer from want of food? In
which condition is your nation?  Why do you think so?
By way of illustration, it may be stated that our nation
belongs to the civilized class; but that even here there are men
who will not work, and are always ready to commit violence,
robbery, and murder: these may justly be ranked as savages.
There are others, constantly moving from place to place, without employment and living by begging or stealing, who may
be called barbairous. Others still, contented to live in a poor
way and not desirous of improving, may be regarded as halfcivilized.According to their degree of civilization, different nations are classed as Civilized, Half-civilized, Barbarous, or Savage.
WRITTEN EXERcISE.-Complete the followi g: In civilized

XIII. SHAPE OF THE EARTH.
For the pupil to read.
We live on the outside, or surface, of a great
body called the Earth.
We have learned something  about our own
neighborhood.  But that is only a small part of
the earth's surface. It will be pleasant to visit
other parts. We may go by steamers on the water, or by cars on the land.  We must expect to
find much that is strange.
One of the strangest things we shall learn, is
that the earth on which we live is round, like a
ball.
SHAPE OF THEIF EARTII.
Yet, when we look at the earth's surface, it
seems to be flat and not round.  This is because
the earth is so large.
In a small ball like that shown in the preceding column, the roundness is readily seen. At
the bottom of the page part of the surface of a
larger ball is represented, in connection with a
flat surface, or _plane.  The difference between
them  is very slight.  The surface of a great ball
like the earth differs still less from a plane. In
the part that falls within our view, we can not
detect any roundness.
What proof have we that the earth is round?
One proof is that, if we start from any place and
keep moving on in the same direction, we shall
come back to the starting-point.  We could not
do this on any body that is not round.
If we started from a point on a plane, and kept
traveling on in the same direction, we should get
farther and farther from the starting-point.
The earth is round. Starting from a giveui
point on the surface, and keeping on in the same
direction, either east or west, we shall return to
the starting-point.
XI F. THE STA4TE.
For the pupil to read.
Before going out to  foreign  countries, we
should know exactly where we now  are.  The
side of the earth on which we live is shown in the
figure in the opposite column.  The outtline of a
large body of land is there drawn, and a country
called the UNITED STATES is marked off. That
is our country.  The teacher will show us the
exact spot in which we are.
Towns and counties, are divisions made by
man.  They are not natural divisions, like mountains and islands,
The division next larger than a county is a
State. A state makes its own laws, and provides
for its own government.  We live in the state of; which, with a number of other states, is
embraced in one large country, the United States.
Flat Surface,or Plane.
PART OF THE SURFACE OF A LARGE gALL.
T7The chief officer of a state is called the Governor. The laws of each state are made by its
Legislature. Both the governor and the members of the legislature are elected by the people.
The capital of a state is the city in which the
laws are made. The capitol is the building in
which the legislature meets to make the laws.
The capital of our state is
NOTE.-The pupil should now copy the outline of the state
in which he lives, from the sectional map on which it is represented. The teacher will decide what scale shall be used, and
the length of the several boundaries may be ascertained by
applying the scale of miles given on the map. Details may
be filled in as they are learned. For capitals and for other
towns, marks like those on the map may be used.
In considering the state, the following order of topics may
be adopted. Many of the questions can be answered from the
sectional map; the other information may be funished by the
teacher, with such degree of fullness as may be thought proper.
i. Outline, boundaries, and extent.
Has your state a regular or an irregular outline? Has it
any coast-line, or is it inland? What natural divisions may
form the boundaries of a state? When there is no such natural boundary, how are the boundaries made? When a boundary is made by man, or is artificial, what kind of a line
is used to represent it? Are the boundaries of your state
natural or artificial? What rivers, mountains, or lakes, form
parts of the boundaries?
Bound your state. Find its greatest length, applying the
scale of miles on the map. What is its greatest width? A
square mile is a square a mile long and a mile wide. On the
sectional map is a square which represents a certain number
of square miles; about how many times is this square contained in the surface of your state, as represented on the
map? About how many square miles, then, are in your state?
2. Mountains, plains, slopes.
What mountains does your state contain? Is it generally
high or low? What part is highest? What part is lowest?
As regards the levels drained, how does water flow? How
can you tell the general slope of a country which contains rivers? What is the slope in different parts of the state?
3. Drainage: rivers and lakes.
What are the principal rivers of the state? Where does
each rise? In what direction does each flow? Into what
does each flow? Into what great body do the waters of each
at last find their way?  What lakes are in the state? In
what part of the state is each lake situated? What inlets
and outlets have they?  Have all lakes inlets and outlets?
How is a lake that has no inlets fed? If a lake has inlets
and no outlet, what prevents it from overflowing its banks?
4. Soil and minerals.
5. Natural curiosities and places of resort.
6. Climate: winds, temperature, moisture, etc.
7. Vegetation: trees; staple products.
8. Animals, wild and domestic.
9. Railroads, canals, and routes of travel.
Io. Occupations of the people.
i i. Religion and social condition.
12. Schools, academies, and colleges.
13. State government.
Who is governor of the state? What is his business?
To execute the laws. Does any one man make the laws? By
whom are the laws made? Of how many bodies does the
legislature consist? What are they called? Why are there
two bodies to make the laws? What is the city in which the
laws are made called? Whose business is it to decide what
the laws mean? How do the judges get their office? By
whom are the governor and legislators elected?  What is a
government called, which is vested in officers chosen by the
people?  A Republican Government. Under what kind of a
government do you live?
I4. Counties: let the pupil name his own
county and any others that he remembers.
I5. Cities:  capital;  largest  city;  seaports.
How is each situated? If on a river, on which
bank, right or left, going toward the mouth?

NOTE.-The pupil is now prepared for the lessons that follow, which he is to study and recite.
It will help the class always to read over in advance with
the teacher the lesson that is next to be prepared.  WUhen a
statc, town, mountain, river, or other division, is first mentioned
in the text, let it be.found on the map without any direction to
that effect, and at recitation let its situation be stated. Direct
attention to the engravings, and ask questions on them.
See that the mode of representing the pronunciation of
proper names is thoroughly understood.
Encourage recitation by topics, without minute questioning. Receive the substance, if given in correct language; the
words of the book are not essential. For those who desire
them, systematic questions on the text are given at the close
of the volume. The matter in heavy-faced type at the end
of the lessons, containing the most important facts, should
always be committed to memory.The present edition of this book was printed before the census of 1880 was taken;
and the statements herein made as to the population of the leading cities of the United
States were based on what were then considered the most trustworthy estimates. The
recent census shows Chicago to have a larger population than St. Louis, and the latter
city to have less than half a million. The statements on pages 45 and 50 should be
corrected accordingly.
The approximate figures, as at present annotnced, for the population of the ten
largest cities of the United States, are as follows:
1. NEW  YORK.........1,207,215
2. PHILADELPHIA.......  843,000
3. BROOKLYN..........   554, 696
4. CIIICAGO...........    503,501
5. ST. Louis...........  375,000

7. BALTIMORE.......... 330,000
8. CINCINNATI......... 255,804
9. SAN FRANCISCO....... 233,066
10. NEW  ORLEANS........ 215,239FROM the title-page of this book may be gathered an idea
of its design, scope, and method. Prepared in accordance
with the views of advanced teachers, it is believed to embody
the most natural and philosophical system.  It treats the
subject objectively, makes knowledge precede definitions, and
presents facts in their logical connections, taking gradual
steps from the known to the unknown. It is offered to the
public in the hope that it will lay a substantial foundation
for the subjective development of this branch of study in the
HIGHER book.
In this volume the aim has been, not to teach much, but to
teach what beginners can understand and digest. It has been
sought to lay no unnecessary burden on, the young learner;
to sift out the useful from the unimportant; and so to link
geographical facts with striking facts of history, of natural
history, and of social life, that they may be permanently impressed on the mind. Special attention is asked to the system
of reviews, to the wzritten exercises interspersed, to the paragraphs in heavy-faced type summing up from  time to time
what is most necessary to be remembered, and to the occasional refercnces introduced for the encouragement of more
extended reading on interesting points.
The Introductory Course is designed to make subsequent
instruction intelligible, by giving the young pupil definite ideas
of position, direction, and distance; of the natural divisions
of land and water, and the manner of representing them on
maps; of climate; of the vegetable, the animal, and the mineral kingdom; and of the occupations and conditions of men.
No formal definitions are given, but the new and necessary
ideas are imparted in reading-lessons, or are drawn out orally
by questions leading up from things already familiar. Illustrations are furnished on which to base such questions, and
model oral exercises are presented, which may be extended by
the teacher as' time and circumstances allow. The pupil is
led out from the scenes of his every-day experience; and his
circle of knowledge is gradually widened till it embraces country after country, and finally includes the entire world. It is
believed that, even with a partial preparatory course like that
here offered, the pupil will be able to cope with the difficulties of the subject far more intelligently and successfully than
by commencing in the old-fashioned way with the earth as a
whole and with abstract definitions.
The beginner is taught in this book to appreciate distance,
to apply the scale of the map, and to draw simple outlines by
the use of the scale and by imitation. The maps of a first
book in Geography should be distinct, unencumbered with
names, accurate, and attractive. Such we have tried to make
the maps ih this volume; as regards the questions on them,
we have sought to present a sufficient number to familiarize the pupil with their contents, without overloading his
memory.
The authors trust that this little volume will be found
elententary, not merely in name and size, but also in the style
and quality of its matter, and above all in its development of
the subject; that the distinctive features of arrangement and
treatment may help to a more easily-acquired, thorough, and
lasting acquaintance with the elements of Geography than
has heretofore been generally attained by Primary classes.

(From the Botanic Gardens.)
I. The United States.-We commence the study of the
earth's surface with the United States, because that is our
own country.  The United States is composed of thirty-eight
different states, all united, or joined together, under one government. It is often spoken of as TIIE UINION.
2. Full Name.-The figure on p. I7 shows tlhe land on
one side of the round earth.  This laild is called Amer'ica.
The United States forms part of America, and the full name
of our country is THE UTNITED STATES OF AMERTICA.NOTE.-It will be well to show the class the situation of
America on a globe, and to give them an idea of the size of the
United States relatively to the whole land-surface on the globe.
3. Map.-Only a very small part of the United
States can be shown in a picture; but the whole
can be represented in a map. A map of the United States is given on pages 22, 23, to which refer.
Map Questions.-Find your state on this map. Find the
part of the state in which you live. Find the capital of your
state. What mark denotes it? What kind of letters are used
for its name? How can you tell a capital?
What is the color of your state? Are the states around
it of the same color? Does the difference of color denote
any difference in the character of the country? Is your state
a large or a small part of the whole country?
What part of the map is north? East? South? West?
Hold your book so that what is north on the map may be toward
the north. In what direction is the upper right-hand corner
from the center of the map?  The upper left-hand corner?
The lower left-hand corner? The lower right-hand corner?
What is on the north of your state? On the east? On
the south? On the west? Give the boundaries of your state
all together, pointing in each direction as you name it:
is biunded on the north by --, on the east by, on the south
by -, on the zwest by -.
The light-tinted country on the north is no part of the
United States. It is called the Dominion of Can'ada; find it.
The light-tinted country on the south does not belong to
the United States. It is called Mex:ico; find it.
4. Size.-The ITnited States is very large.
Boston is one of the great cities in the northeastern part.  San  Francisco is the largest city
in the far west. To go by railroad across the
United States, from  Boston  to  San Francisco,
traveling day and night, takes a week.
If one could go by rail from  the southernmost
point of the United States directly north to Canada, it would take four days and nights. -In what
direction is the United States longest?
Exercis3 with the Scale.-At the bottom of the map on
the left is a Scale of Miles. Apply this scale from Cape Cod
(east of Boston) on a westerly line across the country. How
many times can it be applied? What, then, is the extreme
length from east to west?
Apply this scale on a line running north from the southernmost point of the United States to Canada. How many
times can it be applied?  What, then, is the extreme width
from north to south?
The United States contains 38 states.
Its greatest length is about 2800 miles.
Its greatest width is about 1600 miles.
LESSON II.
I. The Great Lakes.-On the north of the
United States lie five large bodies of fresh water
surrounded by land. They are called Lakes.
Name them from the map.
2. Each of these is larger than some of the
states. Lake Superior is the largest lake in the
world. We call these five lakes the Great Lakes.
Lake Michigan (mish'e-gan) lies wholly within the United
States. Through the four other lakes a line is drawn, on the
map. What does this line denote? What is the color of the
Great Lakes on the map? What does blue on the maps represent? What other bodies of water are on the map?
3. The Atlantic Ocean.-On the eastern border of the United States lies a great body of salt
water. What is it called on the map? A large
body of'salt water like this is called an Oceaz.
There is land on the other side of the Atlantic
Ocean, but it is so far off that steamers run east
for nine days before they sight it.
4. The strip of land bordering the Atlantic
is called the Atlantic Coast. The states bordering the Atlantic are called the Atlantic States.
Name some of them.
5. The Pacific Ocean.-On the western border
of the United States lies another ocean; -find it
on the map.  The first sailor from the Old World
entered it after having met with violent storms.
He found it peaceful, and so called it the Pacific
Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is more than twice as
wide as the Atlantic, and contains more islands.
6. The strip of land bordering the Pacific is
called the Pacific Coast. The states bordering
the Pacific are called the Pacific States.
7. The Gulf of Mexico.-On the southern border of the United States lies a great arm of the
Atlantic Ocean, indenting the land; find it on
the map. Such a body of water is called a Gulf
or Bay. This arm of the Atlantic is called the
Gulf of Mexico.
8. The Territories.-Besides the thirty-eight
states, ten territories belong to the United States.
Nine of them are shown on this map. The tenth,
called Alas'ka, lies farther northwest, and is separated from the rest of the country. The territories are thinly settled. They have not the privi20lege of electing their own governor.  Nor can
they, like the states, make their own laws independently of the General Government.
9. The District of Columbia, also, is included
in the United States.  It contains the capital of
the United States, the city of Washington.
Map Questions.-A small map of the District is given at the lower left-hand corner
of the map of the United States, p. 22.,
On what river is it? What state borders
it on three sides?  What state is on the
opposite side of the Poto'mac?
The District here looks larger than
some of the states on the main map, but
that is because the scale is larger. Look
along the Atlantic coast till you come to
Maryland and Virginia. Find the city of
Washington and the District there. Is
the District really larger than any of the
states?
In what part of the United States is
the District of Columbia? Describe the
situation of Washington. Washington is
on thle left bank of the Potomac River (the
left as you go toward the mouth).     I
Why is it called the District of Columbia? What did Columbus do? When
Columbus discovered America, he first
landed at one of the islands near the
lower right-hand corner of the map; what
are those islands called?
The United States is composed
of thirty-eight states, ten territories, and the District of Columbia.
The District of Columbia contains Washington, the capital of..
the United States.
LESSON   III.
I. Mountains of the  United  States.-Several
adjacent mountain-ranges running in the same
direction form  what is called a mountain-syste/m.
Three great mountain-systems traverse the United S-tates from north to south, or nearly so.
2. The Appala'chian System  is the most easterly. Its ranges have the same direction as the
Atlantic coast. It separates the rivers flowing into
the Atlantic from those that flow toward the west.
Such a dividing ridge is called a Watershed.
Find the three mountain-systems of the United States on
the map. The three principal ranges of the Appalachian (app6-1cy'tshe-d4n) System are the Blue Ridge, the Al'leghanies,
and the Cumberland Mountains. Which of these ranges is
farthest east? Which is farthest west?
3. The Atlantic Slope.-The eastern slope
of the Appalachian Mountains, being
toward the Atlantic, is called the
Atlantic Slope.
4. The Rocky Mountains form
the second of the great systems.
They are continued northward
into the Dominion of Canada,
and  southward  into  Mexico.
They traverse Colorado (kol-orah'do)-which  is called "the
Rocky Mountain State" -- and
the territories that lie north and
south of Colorado.
F THE COLORADO.
5. Pike's Peak.-The  Rocky Mountains contain several peaks nearly three
miles high.  One of the most noted of
these, Pike's Peak, you will find in the
central part of Colorado.  There is a
horseback-trail to the top. It is a hard
ride; yet people sometimes make the ascent for the sake of the grand view.
6. The sources of four great rivers
can be seen from the top of Pike's Peak;
name them. These rivers rise within a
few miles of each other, but their mouths
are many miles apart. Into what does the
Platte (plat) River flow? The Arkan'sas?  The Rio Grande (re'o grahn'day)?
The Colorado?
The Rocky Mountains form an immense watershed. Into
what gulf do the streams on the east at last find their way?
To what ocean do the streams on the west flow?
7. Caiions (kcan'yunz) are gorges between steep
banks, worn by rivers.  They are common near
the Rocky Mountains.
8. The Grand Calon.-The Colorado River is
famous for the G-rand Canon, in Arizo'na; find
this on the map, and see engraving above.  For
two hundred miles the river rushes along through
a deep, dark, narrow chasm, in some places faster
than  the fastest railroad-train.   Huge walls of
rock rise from the stream on either side, to a
height of mnore than half a mile.

5LESSON IV.
i. The Sierra Nevada (se-ehr'ra' nay-vah'dd)
is the most westerly of the great mountain-systems of the United States.  It traverses California, and is continued northward in the Cascade
Range. The Sierra Nevada has some peaks even
higher than those of the Rocky Mountains.
2. The word sierra means a saw. It is applied to a range of mountains having numerous
peaks standing up like the teeth of a saw. Nevada is the Spanish for snowy. The Spanish
once owned California. Why did they call these
mountains the Sierra Nevada?
3. The Pacific Slope.-The western slope of the
Sierra Nevada, being toward the Pacific, is called
the Pacific Slope.
4. The Snow-Line.-As we ascend a very high mountain,
the air grows colder and colder. At last we reach a height
where the snow remains unmelted all the year round. This
is called the Snow-Line. The top of Mount Shasta, a peak of
the Sierra Nevada, is above the snow-line. It can be seen,
white and glittering in the sun, for a hundred miles.
5. The plateau (broad high plain), or tableland, from which the Rocky Mountains and the
Sierra Nevada rise, is very elevated. Some of its
towns are more than a mile above sea-level, and
higher than the tops of the highest mountains in
the Atlantic States.
The three great mountain-systems of the United
States are the Appalachian Mountains, the Rocky
Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada.
LESSON V.
i. The Mississippi VaUey.-Between the Appalachian and the Rocky Mountains lies one of
the most fertile tracts in the world. A tract thus
inclosed between mountain-ranges is called a Valley. This valley, drained by the Mississippi, is
known as the Mississippi Valley. Show where it
lies on the map of the United States.
2. The Mississippi River rises in a little lake
in the north of Minneso'ta. Follow the river up
till you find this lake; what is it called?
3. Its Deposits.-The waters of the upper Mississippi are clear; but those of the Missouri and
other branches bring with them a great deal of
mud. This is carried down, and deposited near
the mouths of the main stream. You see on the
map how the land projects there into the Gulf
of Mexico. It has been gradually formed of deposits from the waters of this great river.
4. We get the word Mississippi from the Indian name for
the stream, meaning "Great River ".
Going down from the source of the Mississippi, name from
the map the branches you find emptying into it on the east.
Mention those on the west. Which is the longest of all the
branches? Which is the longest eastern branch?
5. The Missouri River is muddy, as its name
signifies. It is much longer than that part of
the Mississippi which is above its mouth. If we
regard the part of the Mississippi below  where
the two rivers meet as belonging to the Missouri,
we have a river more than 4,000 miles long-the
longest in the world.
The Missouri, like the Mississippi, has many
large branches. Name some of them.
6. Commerce of the United States.  The Mississippi and its branches form a network of rivers,
spreading over the very heart of the country.
There are many rivers, too, on the Atlantic coast,
and many which flow into the Gulf of Mexico.
Most of these rivers have steamboats on them,
which carry produce and goods. They are the
seat of an active commerce.
7. The Great Lakes are no less busy highways of trade; while from the various harbors on
the coast vessels are constantly sailing, to carry
the products of the United States to foreign lands
and bring back theirs in return. Commerce, also,
is greatly promoted by railroads. These iron roads
thread the states in all directions, and connect
the Atlantic with the Pacific.
To describe a River.--Describe the Mississippi River. The
Mississippi rises in Itasca Lake in the northern part of the
United States, takes a southerly course, and flows into the
Gulf of Mexico. Describe all rivers thus, naming the lakes or
mountains in which they rise, or the rivers that form them.
Describe the Missouri River.
The two largest rivers of the United States are
the Mississippi and the Missouri.  The Mississippi
Valley is one of the most fertile valleys in the world.

TEHE UNITED STATES.LESSON VI.
I. Agriculture.-The JUnited States is a great
farming country.
2. Products of Different Sections.-In the most
northerly sections the climate is cool, the winters
are long, and grass is the most valuable product.
The farmers raise potatoes and oats, rear cattle
and sheep, and sell butter, cheese, and wool.
3. A little farther south the climate is warmer, and we have the great wheat region, extending to about the line marked 40 in the margin of
the map. Just below this line, the heat still increasing, Indian corn, or maize, and tobacco, are
the chief products,
though wheat also
receives attention.
Throughout the
corn region, hogs
are raised in large
numbers.
4. Find the line   _ ___
marked 35 in the
miargin. From a
little north of this  _.
line to the Gulf of               _  E_
Mexico, the sum-   _
mers are long and
hot; the winters
are short, and snow
seldom falls except                   THEF WHITE Hor
on the hills. Cotton is here the staple production. Corn also is
raised, and wheat in the highlands. Rice and
sugar are produced in certain sections.
5. Fruits.-In the extreme north, apples and berries are
the principal fruits. As we go south, cherries, pears, plums,
and peaches appear, and in the far south we have oranges,
lemons, figs, bananas, and pineapples.
6. Manufactures afford employment to great
numbers.  Clothing, boots and shoes, carriages,
hardware, paper, and many other things, are
manufactured.  For this, machinery is used.
Sometimes the machinery is moved by steam. In other
cases, the factories are built on streams having a considerable
descent. The water is made to turn a wheel connected with
the machinery, which is then said to be moved by weater-power.
rsI
7. Mining.-The United States has great mineral wealth.  It contains vast coal-beds, ironmines, lead, copper, and in various parts of the
mountains the precious metals, gold and silver.
Many are employed in getting these treasures out
of the earth.
8. Government. -The highest officer in the
United States is the President.  He is elected
every four years by electors chosen in each state
by the people.  He lives at Washington, the capital, in a fine building called "the White House"
Next to the President is the Vice-President,
who is chosen by the same electors.
9. The laws are made by Congress.  Congress
consists of two bodies, the Senate and
the House of IRepresentatives.  The
Senators are chosen by the different
states, two from
each state.   The
Representatives are
chosen by the people. Congress meets
every year in the
_ _  0 t  wCapitol at Waslhington (p. i9).
_    =     =-~--~-~-- ~ 1~:  -- --  IO. History.The United States
E, WASHINGTON.                is little more than
a hundred years
old. At first it was settled only along the Atlantic coast.  Thirteen colonies, belonging to England, were formed there.  Difficulties arose with
the mother-country. The colonies declared their
independence in I776, and maintained it, under
the great and good Washington, in the Revolutionary WVar. A free government was established..
Thousands from foreign lands crossed the ocean
to the United States.  Large tracts in the West
and South were bought and settled. New territories were formed, and new states were from
time to time admitted into the Union.
The United States contains more than 31 mlillions of square miles, and 50 millions of inhabitants. The highest officer is the President.
25THE NEW ENGLAND STATES.
LESSON VII.
We have taken a general view of the United
States. We shall now visit its different sections.
New England.-Look at the map of the United
States on page 23, the extreme northeastern part.
You will find there six states called Maine, New
Hampshire (hamp'sheer), Vermont, Massachu'setts, Rhode Island, Connecticut (kon-net'e-kut).

L. DIRlECTIO0N.
For the pupil to read.
THE time has come when we are to learn something about the world. We are going to visit
new places, where we shall find many things to
interest us. We start from the school-room.
The school-room has different parts. The ceiling is overhead. The floor is beneath our feet.
A wall is on each side of us. Before us is one
end of the room, behind us is the other end.
Which way is each of these parts from us? The
ceiling is up, the floor is down.  A bird flies
from the ground; a man falls    from a ladder.
We call one of our hands the right hand, and
the other the left. The wall which is on the same
side as our right hand is on our right. The wall
on the same side as our left hand is on our -.
As we sit or stand, we face in a certain way.
The end of the room that we face is in front of
us, the opposite end is back of us.
To go home from school, we must know which
way to go. To direct a person to a certain place,
we must tell him the Direction he must take;
that is, which way he must go.
Up and down, right and left, front and back,
imply certain directions.  There are other names
of directions that are used to denote which way
one thing is from another.
MODEL FOR ORAL EXERCISEc
The following will serve the teacher as a
model for exercises on direction:Point up-down-to the right-to the left-in front of
you--back of you. What part of the school-room is on the
right?  lThe right side. What part of the school-room is on
the left? If you face in the opposite direction, will the same
part of the room be the right side?
Point to where the sun rises. What part of the schoolroom is in that direction?  The right side, left side, front of
the room, or back of the room, as the case may be. What
name is given to that direction?
Point to where the sun sets. What part of the school-room
is in that direction? What name is given to that direction?
Let the class stand, and point to the east with their right
hands, to the west with their left. What direction is in front?
What direction is behind?
Name the four directions you have just found.
Point in the direction between north and east; what shall
we call this direction?  Xortheast. Between east and south;

DESCRIPTIVE  MATTER.
LESSON XI.
I. The name New England implies that there
is an old England. So there is, 3000 miles away,
across the Atlantic. It was from England that
this part of the country was first settled.
2. It was from England that Captain John
Smith, a bold rover who had fought the Turks in
the Old World and the Indians in the New, sailed
to explore this northern region. He called it New
England, and made a map of the coast.
3. The Pilgrims.--Shortly afterward some brave
men, with their wives and children, started from
England to settle in the New World. They wanted to live where they could worship God in their
own way. They had a hard voyage, but at last
they landed at a place which they called Plymouth (plim'uth).  Find Plymouth on the map.
4. Plymouth Rock.-The landing was made
on what has since become famous as Plymouth
Rock. In memory of "the Pil____                        g  grim Fathers," a
_______~          &lt;granite  canopy
has been erected
over this rock.
5. Early History of New England.-For some
years the Pilgrim settlers endured many hardships in the wilderness. They had trouble with
the Indians, and at times they almost starved.
But they had stout hearts and strong hands, and
28persevered till better times came.  More settlers
arrived.  Boston and other towns were founded.
6. Other colonies were soon formed. Massachusetts (including Maine), New  Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, were numbered among
the Thirteen Colonies at the time of the Revolution. Vermont had some settlers, who were called
Green Mlountain Boys, but it was not an independent colony.
The thirteen colonies which established their independence
in the Revolutionary War (1775-I783), and became the thirteen original states of the Union, were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, MIaryland, Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia.
On the settlement of the New England States, consult
Quackenbos's " American History," pages 61-68.
New England was first permanently settled at
Plymouth. The metropolis of New England is Bos.
ton.
LESSON XII.
I. Climate.-New England, lying so far north,
has long and cold winters. If we go there in
winter, we shall probably find the snow deep and
the sleigh-bells ringing merrily.
2. Surface.-Along the Atlantic is a level strip
of land. But, if we travel back from the coast,
we have to go up and down hills, and at last we
come to mountains.  What mountains?
3. Soil.-Along the rivers are fertile valleys,
and some of the hills yield good crops.  But elsewhere the soil is rocky, and not fitted for tillage.
4. Productions.-New England lies mostly in
the northern grass region. The cattle find good
pasturage in summer, and hay is made in abundance for their winter use. Potatoes, corn, rye,
oats, and some wheat, are raised; but not so much
wheat as is needed..
5. In Vermont, especially, much attention is
given to the raising of cattle, sheep, and horses.
Excellent butter and cheese are made there, and
many pounds of wool are clipped from the sheep
that feed on the green hills.
6. Maple-Sugar.--Vermont is also noted for its
maple-sugar.  Most of our sugar is made from
sugar-cane, which grows in the South; but in
New England they make sugar from the sap, or
juice, of maple-trees.
When the first warm weather
of spring begins to restore life to
the trees, the farmers bore holes in
the trunks of their sugar-maples.
They then insert spouts, through
which the sap trickles out into    In TIIE SUGAR-BusH.
pails. The sap, collected from the
pails, is next boiled down into sirup, and finally into sugar.
7. Lumbering.-In the north of New England
are great forests.  Maine, in particular, is famous
for its timber. The city of BANGOR is one of
the greatest lumber-depots in the country.
8. In winter men go out into the woods and
cut down trees.  These, with the aid of oxen,
they haul to the nearest streams.  When the ice
melts in spring, they float the logs down to mills
to be sawed into lunmber.  Getting out timber is
called Lumbering.
9. Occupations on the Coast.-New England has
many miles of coast, which afford good harbors.
From these harbors we should expect vessels to
sail, carrying out the products of the country and
bringing back those of foreign lands.  Where
vessels are used, some are likely to be built. And
on a coast abounding in cod and mackerel, we
should look for many an adventurous fisherman.
Accordingly, we find that
The people on the coast of New England are large.
ly engaged in commerce, fishing, and ship-building.
In the country districts, agriculture, dairying, and
lumbering, are the leading occupations. Manufacturing is done chiefly in the river towns.
29LESSON XIII.
r. Commerce.-The Foreign Commerce of New
England is carried on chiefly through BoSTON
and PORTLAND, which are connected by railroads
with all parts of the country. There is also an
active trade with other states.  This is called
Domestic Commerce.
2. Lake Champlain is the seat of considerable
commerce, of which the picturesque city of BURLINGTON is the center.
3. Exports and Imports. Commerce implies
that native productions are sent out, or exported,
and the products of other regions are brought in,
or imported.  New England exports her nlumerous manufactures, lumber, and ice; also, marble
and granite, which are her most valuable minerals.
She imports cotton and iron, to be mainufactured,
coal, flour, etc.
4. Manufacturing is the most important branch
of industry in New England. Cotton and wool
are woven into cloth. Leather is made into boots
and shoes.  Iron is converted into steel, machinery, and hardware. Clothing, hats, firearms, and
many other useful articles, are made.
5. Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, are the great manufacturing states. Thev are
also the most thickly settled states in the -Union,
for in manufacturing many hands are needed.
INTERIOR OF A COTTON-FACTORY.
6. A Cotton-Factory is an interesting place to
visit. The cotton comes to it in bales, and goes
out in the form  of muslin.  It is a wonderful
sight to look through a long room, where perhaps a hundred persons are at work, and watch
the spindles twisting the cotton into thread, or
the looms weaving the thread into cloth.
7. Manufacturing Cities.-For manufacturing
purposes, sites are sought near some river that
has falls or a rapid descent.  Such a river is the
AMerrimac.  It drives more machinery than any
other river of its size in the world. On its banks
are MA:NCHESTER  and  NASHUA, LOWELL  and
LAWRENCE, all of which owe their prosperity to
manufactures.
8. WORCESTER and FALL RIVER in Massachusetts, PAWTUCKET and  WOONSOCKET in Rhode
Island, BRIDGEPORT in Connecticut, LEWISTO-N
and  BIDDEFORD  in  Maine, are also important
manufacturing  places.'ALL RIVER is famous
for its prints, or printed cloths, and runs more
spindles than any other city in the United States.
Point to these places on the map.
9. Familiar Names given to some of the states
help us to remember what distinguishes them.
Maine is called the Pine-Tree State.
New Hampshire is called the Gralnite State.
Vermont is called the Green Mountain State.
/lMassachusetts is called the Bay State.
Rhode Island is called Little Rhody, because it
is the smallest state in the Union.
Connecticut is the Land of Steady Habits.
The six largest cities of New England are,
Boston, the sixth city of the Union in size.
Providence, a great manufacturing city.
New Haven, the beautiful City of Elms.
Lowell and Worcester, manufacturing cities.
Cambridge, the seat of Harvard University, the
oldest college in the United States.

THE -MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES.
LESSON XIV.
I. Middle Atlantic States.-Leaving New England and taking a southwesterly direction, we
come to another group of states. They lie on or
very near the Atlantic, and are therefore Atlantic
States. There are some Atlantic States north of
them, and some south of them; therefore they are
called the MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES.
2. Routes.-We may go from New England to
these states by railroad. Or we may take a steamboat at Burlington, and cross Lake Champlain
to the State of New York. Or we may take the
cars to Providence or Fall River, or to a port on
Long Island Sound, whence steamboats run to
the great city of New York.
Map Questions.-(See Map of the United States, p. 23.)

On what river does West Virginia lie?
Name from the map the seven Middle Atlantic States.
Which is the largest of the Middle Atlantic States? The
smallest? The least mountainous? Which extends farthest

3. New  York, which  surpasses all the other
states in population and wealth, is called the Empire State.  Pennsylvania  (Penn's woods) preserves the name of the good Quaker, William
Penn, by whom it was founded. Virginia, in
which the first permanent English settlement in
the country was made, is called the Old Dominion. West Virginia was formed from Virginia.
New Jersey is noted for its watering-places, and
the fine ocean-bathing they afford.
To the Middle Atlantic group belong the two
most populous states in the Union-New York and
Pennsylvania: also, the three largest cities-New
York, the commercial metropolis of the New World,
Philadelphia, and Brooklyn.

LESSON XVIII.
I. Comparative Size.--Compare the maps on
pages 27 and 33. Are the squares that represent
I,ooo square miles the same size? Which is the
larger? This shows that the map of New England is on the larger scale.
We must not be misled by this. New York,
Pennsylvania, and Virginia, are each larger than
Maine, though they look smaller on the map.
2. Climate.-This group of states stretches so
far from north to south that there is a great variety of climate. Northern New York is cold, like
New England. As we go south, the climate grows
warmer. In southern Virginia, except on the
highlands, it is very mild; snow seldom falls.
3. Surface.-A level strip, called the Atlantic
Plain, borders the ocean. From this the land
rises to the tops of the Appalachian Mountains.
Thence it slopes, on the western side, for the most
part, toward the Ohio River and Lake Ontario.
Name three rivers that descend this slope to
the Ohio. Name two that flow into Lake Ontario.
Five rivers, however, make their way through
the mountains to the Atlantic. Name them.
4. Scenery.--Where these rivers break through
the mountains, there are high banks and fine
views. The Highlands of the Hudson, near West
Point, present most beautiful scenery.
5. Niagara Falls.-This section contains some
grand waterfalls.  The most celebrated are the
Falls of Niagara, which people come to this country from all parts of the world to see.
Lake Ontario is 333 feet lower than Lake Erie.
The Niagara is a wide river that connects them.
In its short course it falls 333 feet. First is a succession of boiling rapids. Then the great mass
of waters plunges I50 feet or more over a rocky
ledge, sending up clouds of spray.
6. The Adirondack Mountains and the regions
near them, west of Lake Champlain, are covered
with forests and dotted with lakes.  Many go
there every summer to hunt and fish.  Wolves,
deer, bears, and panthers, are found there.
7. Agriculture, etc.-The people in all these
states are largely engaged in farming. Dairying,
with its products of butter and cheese, receives
much attention in'New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.  Lumbering is
carried on in forest
districts, and many
are engaged in mining coal and iron.
8. Agricultural
Products.- In  the
north, hay, potatoes,
and oats, are the principal crops; barley,
-  buckwheat, and rye,
~----~-~-~   YBI~I- -_;- "__are also raised.  GoTOBACCO.         ing south, we soon
reach the wheat-belt,
and after that the corn and tobacco region.
9. Market-Gardening.-The great cities of this
section use enormous quantities of vegetables and
fruit. To supply them keeps many farmers busy.
Large tracts on Long Island and in New Jersey are laid out in market-gardens; New Jersey,
indeed, is called the Garden State.  Maryland
and Delaware are famous for their excellent strawberries and peaches. Even from as far south as
Norfolk, steamers carry cargoes of early peas, tomatoes, berries, melons, etc., to the New York
markets.
New York yields more hay, potatoes, buckwheat,
and dairy products, than any other state.
Virginia and Maryland are great tobacco-raising
states.
LESSON XIX.
1. Mineral Treasures abound in the Middle
Atlantic States. Coal-fields cover one-fourth of
Pennsylvania, two-thirds of West Virginia, and
parts of western Maryland and of Virginia.
2. Iron.--When iron-ore is taken from  the
earth, it contains various substances besides iron.
To separate these, it has to be smelted in furnaces
(see engraving on p. i2), and for this purpose
34
lcoal is used.  Pennsylvania abounds in both the
ore and the coal for smelting it, and so produces
nearly half the pig-iron (iron in pigs or bars)
made in the United States. Each of the Middle
Atlantic States contains valuable iron deposits.
3. Petroleum, or rock-oil, is another important
mineral product of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It is pumped up from wells sunk in the
earth. Petroleum is used for making kerosene
and gas, for oiling machinery, etc. What place in
the northwest of Pennsylvania gets its name from
the abundance of petroleum produced near it?
4. Salt.-New York surpasses the other states in
the production of salt. Find SYRACUSE. In and
near this city are large
wells, from which brine
is obtained. Salt is made
by evaporating the brine.
5. Manufacturing is                 
very largely carried on.
NEW YORK and PHILADELPHIA take the lead
in this important branch
of industry. BALTIMORE
has many large manufactories, including ironworks and establishments
for packing  oysters,
fruits, and vegetables.
6. Manufacturing Cities. - PITTSBURGIH, the
second city of Pennsyl-          DREDGING FOR OYSTER,
vania in size, is noted
for its manufactures of iron.  NEWARK and JERSEY CITY are important manufacturing cities of
New Jersey. ROCHESTER, situated in western New
York, at the falls of the Genesee River, has numerous flouring-mills and other factories. TROY
stands foremost in the production of stoves.
7. RICHEMOND, the picturesque capital of Virginia, at the lower falls of the James River, is
famous for its large flouring-mills, iron-works,
and tobacco-factories.  WHEELING, the capital
of West Virginia, also owes much of its importance to manufactures.  WILMINGTON, in Delaware, has celebrated powder-mills and car-works.
LESSON  XX.
i. Commerce.-The Aliddle Atlantic States are
the chief seat of foreign commerce. They contain the important commercial cities of New
York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Numerous
railroads, including great trunk lines from the
West, terminate at these cities, and bring in
large quantities of grain and provisions to be
shipped abroad.  An active domestic commerce
is also carried on from these and other cities.
2. New York.- More than half the foreign
commerce of the country centers at New York.
This city lies mainly on Manhattan Island, at the
mouth of the Hudson.
It has a noble harbor.
3. The Hudson is navigable to  Albany  and
Troy, and there the Erie
Canal connects it with
Lake Erie. Another caW~_I                nal connects the Hudson
__   s with  Lake Champlain.
Thus there is water communication all the way
from the Great Lakes and
Canada to the metropolis. This -has helped to
make New York the great
city it is.
4. Other Commercial
Cities. - BUFFALO, one
IN CHIIESAPEAKE BAY.   of the chief lake-ports,
has an immense trade
in grain and live-stock.  BROOKLYN has spacious storehouses and is an important grain-depot.
NORFOLK, the chief seaport of Virginia, is a
shipping-point for fruit and vegetables, cotton
and oysters. The oysters come from Chesapeake
Bay and the waters connected with it.
The six largest cities of the Middle Atlantic States:
New York, the Empire City.
Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love.
Brooklyn, the City of Churches.
Baltimore, the Monumental City.
Buffalo, the Queen City of the Lakes.
Pittsburgh, the Iron City.

Your desk from the teacher's desk?  In what direction are
you from me? In what direction am I from you? Where
would you have to stand, to be north of me? To be south

would you still be south of me? *
To be learned.
There are four principal directions; North, East,
South, and West.  Northeast is midway between
north and east. Southeast is midway between south
and east. Southwest is midway between south and
west. Northwest is midway between north and west.

II. DIST.4XCE  ITXD ME,JS URIXG.
For the pupil to read.
To  find a place, we must know  something
more than in what direction it is from us. We
may know that it is on our right or on our left,
that it is north or south of us; but, to locate it,
we must also know  how far off it is.  We must
know its Distance, as well as its direction.
In order to find how  far off a thing is, we
* NOTE.-Exercises like these should be repeated daily,
the pupil pointing to different objects and parts of the room,
naming the direction of one from another and of each from
himself-then changing his position, and naming his new direction from each. The drill should be extended to objects out
of doors, till all are perfectly familiar with the eight points
designated, and can tell directions promptly and accurately.
This accomplished, the matter in heavy-faced type should
be committed to memory.  Let paragraphs in this type
throughout the book be nzemorized, and kept in mind by frequent reviews.
Then follows an exercise which tests the pupil's comprehension of what he has learned, by requiring him to complete
sentences from which words are omitted.  If written, such
exercises, besides impressing on the mind the facts they embody, become valuable helps in teaching language, spelling,
punctuation, and penmanship. Itts recommended that they
be written, and they are hereafter headed WRITTEN EXERCISES.
If, however, circumstances require, the sentences as completed may be read.
have certain Measures, as they are called.  Here
is one of the smallest measures.
We must look at it carefully, and remember exactly how long it is. We must cut a piece of
paper or of wood just as long as this measure.
We must try to draw lines of the same length as
the measure, till we can do it exactly. Then we
shall know how much an Inch is, for this measure is an inch.
Next we must put two inches together,
and try to draw a line of this length; and so
with three, four, five, and six inches.
If we cut a strip of paper six inches in length,
we shall find that it is just as long as the reading-matter on this page is wide. If we put two
such strips together, we have a new measure,
twelve inches long, called a Foot. It will be well
to keep an inch and a foot measure at hand.
An inch and a foot measure are used, not only
to determine how far one thing is from another,
but also to find how long a thing is, or how wide,
or how high.*
MODEL FOR ORAL EXERCISES.
(The teacher draws a line on the blackboard.) Is this line
greater or less than an inch? Let each pupil try to draw a
line an inch long. Here are some strips of paper; let each
try to tear from one of the strips a piece an inch long. Compare the piece with your inch measure, and if you are wrong
try again.
* NOTE.--In like manner, by putting three feet together,
the idea of a yard may be developed; and by putting five and
a half yards together, the idea of a rod. The name of each
may be given as soon as a correct idea of its length has been
formed.
The class should then be supplied with a yard and a rod
measure. A stout cord 16j feet long, with a knot at every
foot, and a double knot at every yard, is all that is necessary.
The pupil should next be taught to measure the schoolroom and objects in it, as well as distances out-of-doors, until
he becomes familiar with the relative length of the measures
employed. He should also be called on to estimate the length,
width, and height of different, objects, and their distance
apart, in inches, feet, or yards; and then to test his estimate
by applying the measure.
The idea of a mile and its fractional parts is best conveyed
by reference to prominent objects distant from the school
about a mile, half a mile, a quarter of a mile, etc.
4DESCRIPTIVE MATTER.
LESSON  XXIII.
I. The ten Southern States comprise the southern and warmest part of the Union.  Among
them is Texas, the largest of all the states. Texas
is four times the size of New England, but in
some parts there are very few inhabitants.
2. History.-The Carolinas and Georgia were
among the original thirteen states. They took a
gallant part in the Revolution. At one time the
British thought they had subdued the Carolinas,
but at last they were driven out.
3. Florida was bought from the Spanish, who
were the first settlers on the mainland of America.
ST. AUGUSTINE (aw-gus-teen'), on the Florida
coast, is the oldest town in the United States.
4. Louisiana, Arkansas, and a vast region north
of them, were bought from the French.  Texas
once belonged to Mexico, but gained its independence after a hard struggle. It adopted a single
star for its emblem, and since its admission to the
Union it has been styled the Lone Star State.
5. Surface.-The Southern States are comparatively level and low. The southern part of Louisiana is but little higher than the Mississippi.
When floods, or freshets, occur, it would be overflowed were it not for banks, called lev'ees, built
for many miles along the river. Sometimes these
are broken, and great damage is done.
6. Swamps.--In the low grounds near the coast
are large swamps. Dismal Swamp extends from
Virginia into North Carolina. Its soil is soft
and black. The Everglades in Florida consist of
similar swamps, overgrown with coarse grass and
palmettoes.
7. Sometimes these swamps are threaded by
bayous (bi'ooz), or channels connecting some river
or lake with the Gulf, in which lazy alligators
(turn to engraving, p. io) may be seen sunning
themselves. Mississippi is called the Bayou State.
8. Mountains.-Going back from  the coast,
however, we find hilly, and even mountainous,
sections. The Cumberland Mountains and other
ranges of the Appalachian System run through
East Tennessee. The Alleghanies and the Blue
Ridge cross the western part of North Carolina.
Here we have the highest peak east of the Mississippi. It is called Mount Mitchell.
9. Climate.-The climate is warm and genial.
Many sick persons go south, particularly to South
Carolina and Florida, to avoid the northern winter and spring.
The Southern States consist in great part of low
plains. Texas is the largest state in the Union. St.
Augustine, Florida, is the oldest town in the United
States.
Map-drawing.-Copy the outline of Tennessee from the
map on p. 36, making the scale twice as large. Get the proper
dimensions and distances by measuring those on the map and
doubling the measures obtained.
Write the names of the bounding states outside of the outline, where they belong. Insert the Cumberland Mountains,
the Cumberland River, and the Tennessee River. Locate Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, a busy railroad center, and Knoxville, the principal place in East Tennessee.
Imagine yourself on a steamboat at Chattanooga, going
down the river-what river? What state would you soon
enter? What shoals would you reach? Taking another
steamboat west of the shoals, which are not navigable, between what states would you soon pass? What state would
you then enter? What river would you at last reach?
LESSON XXIV.
I. Industrial Pursuits.--There are some valuable mineral deposits-especially of gold in the
Carolinas and Georgia, and other minerals in
North Carolina; but mining is not a leading
pursuit.  Manufactures are increasing, but the
South  is not a manufacturing  region.   Commerce engages some attention. But throughout
the Southern States the chief pursuit is agriculture, to which their fertile soil and warm climate adapt them.  The farms are large, and are
called plantations.
z. Agricultural Products.-The northern part
of this section is in the tobacco-belt. Wheat
flourishes in the uplands, but corn is the leading
grain. Rice is raised in the lowlands, particularly in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Georgia.
Sweet-potatoes abound in all parts.
3. Sugar-Cane is a great staple of Louisiana.
The cane is crushed in mills (see engravtng, p. I4).
38The juice thus extracted is boiled down. From
the scum which rises and is removed, rum is distilled.  The sugar forms in grains, and the liquid
that drains from it is molasses.
4. Cotton.-But of all the products of the
Southern States, cotton is the most important.
The people of warm countries dress mostly in
cotton goods. The cotton-factories of the world
keep thousands of hands employed, and for their
supply  of cotton rely mainly on our Southern
States. Texas produces the most cotton.
5. Fruits.- The fig, and in the more southerly
sections the orange, lemon, and lime, flourish.
The beautiful orange-groves of Florida are famous
for their excellent fruit, which forms one of the
most important exports of that state.
6. Forest Trees. Pine forests are a source of
wealth to certain districts. The stately cypress
grows in the swamps. South Carolina from its
palmettoes gets the name of the Palmetto State.
Florida and Georgia are noted for their live-oak,
much prized in ship-building.
WRITTEN EXERCISE.-Complete the folloiwing: New York is
called the. It belongs to the group of  States, which
lie along the  ~, between -       on the northeast and the

largest -- of the Union. Pennsylvania is noted for its -.

LESSON XXV.
I. Stock-raising is a leading pursuit in Texas.
There are large ranches, or stock-farms, on which
immense numbers of cattle, sheep, and horses, are
raised. Grass is abundant, and the climate is so
warm that stock does not need housing in winter.
2. Texan beef goes to northern markets, and
is even shipped across the Atlantic. Some of it
is packed in cans.
3. Pine Products. -Pine is useful for the lumber made from it. But there are some kinds of
pine in the South, valuable for the turpentine,
tar, pitch, and rosin, which are obtained from
them.
4. The great turpentine district is on the North
Carolina coast.  WILMINGTON  is its shippingpoint. Another turpentine region is on the coast
of G-eorgia.
A FLORIDA ORANGE-GROVE.
5. New Orleans, built on a bend of the Mississippi shaped like a crescent, is called the Crescent City. Its situation makes it the metropolis of the Southwest and the seat of a large foreign commerce. It is the great cotton-market of
the world, and the chief sugar-market of the
United States.
6. Other Cities.-The shipping of cotton makes
several of the southern seaports-CHARLESTON,
MOBILE, SAVANNAH, and GALVESTON- active
centers of commerce.
7. Many river-ports, also, are largely engaged
in the shipment of cotton and the importation of
planters' supplies.  Among these are MEMPHIS
and VICKSBURG. ATLANTA is one of the busiest
cities of the South; five railroads center there.
The Southern States are the great cotton-fields of
the world. South Carolina is the rice state. Louisiana is the sugar state.

DESCRIPTIVE MATTER.
LESSON XXX.
I. History.-A hundred years ago, this region
contained no great grain-farms or cities. The
United States owned as far as the Mississippi,
but there were only scattered forts and tradingposts. It was not till after the Revolution that
many settlers crossed the Alleghanies.
4C~2. The Indians did not give up their huntinggrounds without a struggle; but at last they had
to yield. They have left names full of meaning,
however, stamped on many streams, and lakes, and
hills, and even on the states themselves. Ohio
(beautiful), Wisconsin (wild, rushing torrent),
Minnesota (cloudy water), etc., are Indian names.
3. The Great West was at first on the east
bank of the Mississippi. But when a vast region
beyond this river was bought from France, the
Mississippi Valley became the central part of the
United States. Multitudes were attracted by its
smiling lands. Railroads developed the country.
Cities sprung up. Their rapid growth has been
the wonder of the world.
4. "The Lake State" is the familiar name
given to Michigan. It might also be applied to
Wisconsin and Minnesota; for these states, like
Michigan, not only border on the Great Lakes,
but have hundreds of smaller sparkling lakes
within their boundaries.
5. Lake Navigation.-The Great Lakes are navigable throughout. In the St. Mary's River, which
connects Lakes Superior and Huron, are rapids,
but a ship-canal has been built around them.
6. A canal has also been constructed in Canada, connecting Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, so
that vessels can pass from the one to the other
notwithstanding the Falls of Niagara. Thus there
is water communication from the head of Lake
Superior to the St. Lawrence River, and down
the St. Lawrence to the Atlantic Ocean.
7. Surface.-Prairies are extensive level or rolling tracts, covered with grass, but without a tree.
Prairie-land usually has a deep, rich soil, and
when tilled yields heavy crops.
8. Most of Kansas and the North Central States
consists of prairie-land. There are hills in some
parts, and in eastern Kentucky and southern Missouri mountains of no great height. The borders
of the rivers are well wooded, and the northern
part of Michigan and Wisconsin is heavily timbered.
Klansas and the North Central States are mostly
rich prairie-land. The Ohio Valley is large and
very fertile.
LESSON XXXI.
i. Mammoth Cave.-Kentucky contains one of
the greatest natural curiosities in the world. It
is Mammoth Cave--near what river (see map)?
This cavern extends nine miles into the earth,
and to visit all its parts one would have to travel
a hundred and fifty miles.  It has wonderful
domes and waterfalls, deep pits, and lakes and
rivers with eyeless fish.
2. Minerals.-What state did we find full of
coal and iron? Missouri is another state that
abounds in these minerals. It has two mountains,
Pilot Knob and Iron Mountain, made up entirely
of iron-ore. In what part of the state are they?
A valuable coal-field extends through Illinois
and Indiana, into Kentucky. Southeastern Ohio,
and the Des Moines Valley in Iowa, are also rich
in coal. Iron is abundant in Wisconsin.
3. Iron and copper are a source of great wealth
to Michigan. They are found in the northern
peninsula. The Michigan copper-mines are the
richest in the world. They were worked before
white men ever saw them. It is believed they
were known to a race skilled in many of the arts,
who occupied the Mississippi Valley before the
Indians. Large quantities of salt are made near
EAST SAGINAW.
4. Where Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa join, is
a great lead region; DUBUQUE is its commercial
center. Point to this lead region on the map.
5. The Black Hills, in Dakota, contain gold and other mineral deposits.
6. Agricultural Products--
Kentucky is the leading state in
the production of tobacco and
hemp; Iowa, in that of flax.
Hemp is used in
making rope.--From
the fibers about the
hollow stems of flax,
linen thread is manufactured. From the
seed linseed-oil is expressed, and what is
left is made into oilHEMP-LEAVES AND FLOWER.   cake for fattening cat43tle.-Tobacco was not known in the Old World till after the
discovery of America. The practice of smoking it came from
the Indians. One of Sir Walter Raleigh's ships first carried
tobacco and the potato to the Old World. While the potato
was still hardly known, tobacco had come into common use
in most of the countries of Europe.
7. Wheat.-The greater part of the North Central States lies in the wheat-belt. This is the
finest wheat region of the world. Millions of
bushels more than are needed for home use are
raised every year, and sent to other nations whose
crop is short. The numerous railroads, the Great
Lakes, the Ohio River, and the Mississippi, afford
the means of transporting it.
8. Indian Corn, or maize, is a staple product
of all these states-the leading product of several
of them, including the Central States. Oats also
are extensively raised.
9. Other Products.-Sorghum, or Chinese sugar-cane, from which molasses is produced and
sugar is beginning to be made, is an important
crop. Grapes flourish, and wine is manufactured.
Michigan is a great fruit state.
io. Live-Stock. The raising of live-stock is a
leading industry throughout this section. Wool
and salted pork are largely exported.
The Central and the North Central group embrace the great corn and wheat states. They have
the richest copper and lead mines.
Illinois produces the most corn; Kentucky, the
most tobacco.
WRITTEN EXERCISE. - Complete the
following: The Central States lie bei    i.............. tween the  States on the south and
the      States on the north. There
are some mountains in     and;
but Kansas is mainly prairie-land, like
the -   States.  Michigan borders on
five lakes; namely,. The principal
lake-ports are -.  To go by water
from  Kansas City to Pittsburgh, we
should have to sail on the  rivers.
The lead region lies on both sides of the. The copper-mines are on a

Hills are in. Gold has been discovered there. Near the diggings is the
town of --. Deadwood is on the border of --. Dakota, with its rich prairies, resembles the  States.
LESSON XXXII.
I. Manufactures.  In the Central and the North
Central States less attention is paid to manufacturing than to tilling the soil.  Yet many articles for home use are extensively manufactured.
2. Flouring-mills grind immense quantities of
wheat.  In this manufacture, ST. Louis surpasses
every other city of the Union.  MINNEAPOLIS, at
the Falls of St. Anthony in the Mississippi River,
is also noted for its flour.
3. Numerous saw-mills turn the logs of northern Michigan and Wisconsin into lumber.  This
is exported to points where timber is scarce.
4. Many furnaces are at work, separating the
metals from their ores.  There are large factories,
which turn out the best agricultural implements
in the world, furniture, machinery, etc.
5. Pork-packing.-Thousands of hogs are cut
up every year. The fat is tried out into lard;
the hams are cured, and other parts are salted,
and barreled or smoked.   This constitutes the
business of pork-packing, for which the cities of
CHIcAGo and CINCINNATI are noted.
6. Commerce is one of the most important pursuits of this section.  It has been the chief source
of wealth to the three great cities, ST. LouIs,
CHICAGO, and CINCINNATI.
7. St. Louis and Chicago are the largest cities
44west of the Alleghanies. They each contain more
than half a million of people. St. Louis is connected with the east by the Ohio River, with the
northwest by the Missouri, with the north and
south by the Mississippi.  Besides, it is a great
railroad center. So it has become the market for
vast regions teeming with rich products.
8. Chicago carries on a vast commerce by
both lake and railroad. Its trade in grain, pork,
lumber, and live-stock, is immense.  Fifty years
ago, there were only a few houses and an old fort
where this magnificent city now stands.
9. Cincinnati, with its beautiful suburbs,
stretches ten miles along the Ohio River. It is
a busy commercial and manufacturing center.
Fine steamboats are built there.  A costly suspension-bridge spans the Ohio at Cincinnati.
Io. Louisville.-Louis XVI., king of France,
helped the Americans when they
were fighting against Great Britain
in the Revolutionary War. LouisVILLE was named in his honor.  It
is a large commercial city, and one of
the chief markets for tobacco-leaf.   I~     
I I. Lake-Ports.-Many lake-ports
besides Chicago carry on an active
commerce.  Chief among these is
CLEVELAND, which is also extensively engaged in manufacturing
iron and refining petroleum.  DETROIT trades largely with Canada.
MILWAUKEE  is a famous wheatmarket.  TOLEDO has a fine harbor
on the Maumee, near Lake Erie.         1
I2. Railroad Centers.-Railroads,
with which these states are threaded, have helped to build up large
cities-markets and forwarding points for fertile
regions around them.
Among the prominent railroad centers are INDIANAPOLIS, KANSAS CITY, DAVENPORT, and
ST. PAUL.  OMAIHA  is at the eastern end of
lines of railroad extending to the Pacific Ocean,
I,8oo miles in length.
St. Louis, Chicago, and Cincinnati, are the three
great cities of the Central and North Central States.
THE  ROCKY  MOUNTAIN  AND  PACIFIC
STATES AND  TERRITORIES.
LESSON XXXIII.
Fromn the North Central States we travel west.
Turn to the map of the United States, p. 22.
At Omaha, the chief city of Nebraska, we may
take the railroad for the Pacific. This follows
the Platte River through Nebraska. It traverses
southern Wyo'ming, Utah, Nevada (nzay-vah'da'),
and California, till it brings us to San Francisco,
the chief city of the Pacific coast. It crosses two
mountain-systems; what are they?
We thus pass through the most westerly section of the Union, consisting of the Rocky Mountain and Pacific States and Territories. It extends from the Dominion of Canada on the north,
to Mexico on the south.

MAP OF SCHOOL-ROOM.
III.  USI7G  JA  SCILE.
For the pupil to read (.filling up the blanks, and
doing the work indicated).
I have measured the school-room, and find it
to be       feet long.  If I should try to draw on
the blackboard a straight line of this length, to
represent one side of the school-room, I should
find the board too short to hold it.  But I can
make an inch on the board stand for a foot of
length, and I will draw  a line         inches long
for the side of the room.
By measuring the school-room, I find it to be
feet wide.  Allowing, as before, one inch
for a foot, I will represent one end of the room
by a line  -  inches long, joining the line that
stands for the side.  Next I will draw the other
side, and then the remaining end.
I have now represented the school-room on
what is called a Scale of an inch to a foot. On
the slate I should draw  it on a smaller scalehalf an inch, or a quarter of an inch, to a foot.
As we have measured the school-room and
made a map of it, so we may also measure the
school-grounds and make a map of them.

DESCRIPTIVE  MATTER.
LESSON XXXVII.
I. History.--Some of these states and territories were made from the large tract bought from
France.  The rest, including California and Nevada, were laid off from territory acquired from
Mexico. Mexico was settled by the Spanish, who
named many places after the saints. San and
Santa mean saint in the Spanish language.
What cities and islands in California show by
their names that the Spanish once lived there?
2. Indians.-You sometimes read in the newspapers of battles with the Indians. It is out here
that they take place. Wild Indians still rove over
parts of these territories, hunting the bison and
other game. Difficulties arise between them and
the whites, and these lead to wars.
3. Government has forts scattered throughout
this section, to maintain order. To these the Indians often come, to get blankets and other things
they need; see the picture on page 45.
4. Indian Territory, which was shown on the
IMap of the Southern States, also contains Indians;
but many of these have settled down on farms and
learned the peaceful arts.
5. Wild animals, like wild Indians, inhabit this
part of our country. Great herds of bisons roam
to and fro in search of pasturage. Rocky Mountain sheep are common-and deer, for which the
cougar lies in wait near their drinking-places.
The beaver and otter are trapped. The black bear
prowls among the mountains; and the fiercer griz:
zly bear, dangerous to the hunter unless his aim
is true.-The Columbia River teems with salmon.
6. Size.-All these states and territories are
large. Washington Territory, which is the smallest, is twice as large as Maine. You will see this,
if you compare the scale of this map with that of
the map of New England on page 27.
7. Surface.-This is the most mountainous part
of our country. The various ranges rise from a
lofty plateau, to which there is a gradual ascent
from the prairies and lowlands on the east. Mines
are worked in Colorado at nearly twice the height
of the White Mountains.8. Climate and Soil.-The winds from the Atlantic are drained of their moisture on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains.  The winds
from the Pacific part with theirs on the Pacific
Slope. So between the Rocky Mountains and the
Sierra Nevada but little rain falls. The soil is
mostly barren, except where the farmers irrigate
their fields-that is, dig channels from the rivers
and carry streams among their crops.
The valleys of California and Oregon are very
fertile.  The climate of the Pacific Slope is uniform and mild.  Snow is rare in San Francisco.
9. Great Salt Lake is the largest lake in this
section. Most lakes are fresh, but this one is so
salt that fish can not live in it.  You could bathe
there with little danger, for the water is so heavy
with salt that it buoys
up the body. The lake,c:~:,~~~is seventy-five  miles
long, but shallow; it
contains several large
islands.  Steamers ply
on  its waters.  The
surrounding country is
desolate.
The Rocky Mountain
and Pacific States and
Territories  are  high,
mountainous, for the
most part thinly set-:?,....f&lt;       tled, and dry between
/':?'~:,         %the two great mountain-systems. They are
all noted for their metallic treasures.
LESSON XXXVIII.
i. The National Park, in Wyoming, set apart
for the use of the people, is nearly three times as
large as the whole State of Rhode Island. It is
full of natural wonders-waterfalls, canons, and
geysers (ghi'sers), or springs that send up great
streams of hot water many feet into the air.
2. The Parks of Colorado are a different kind
of park.  These are valleys formed of plateaus
bounded by spurs of mountains.  What parks do
you find in Colorado on the map?
3. Natural Curiosities of California.-The Yosemite (yo-sem'e-te) Valley affords the grandest
views.  It is a vast chasm, extending eight miles
between granite walls that rise straight up more
than half a mile into the air.  Several streams
plunge into the valley, forming beautiful falls,
one of which has a descent of 1,500 feet.
There are, besides, boiling mineral springs, mud
volcanoes, and the biggest trees in the world, 2,o00
years old.  A man can ride on horseback seventyfive feet through the hollow trunk of one of them,
as it lies on the ground.
4. Occupations.-Numbers have flocked to different parts of this section, to get out the precious metals.  Many on the Pacific coast are engaged in tilling the soil. Others raise stock. California is one of the best countries in the world for
sheep-raising; wool is among its chief exports.
5. In these newly-settled regions, manufactures
are generally limited. But a great deal of lumber is made; the forests of the Sierra Nevada,
Oregon, Washington, and
the mountains of Colorado,
furnish the very best timber.
6. Commerce is actively
pursued on the Pacific coast.
The miners need supplies,
and this creates a large do1mestic commerce. San Francisco, owing to its traffic with
the interior, its coast-trade,
and its commerce with the
rich countries across the Pacific, is the busiest seaport of
OALIFOR~IIA,         its size in the world.
97. Agricultural Products. -Wheat and oats are
the staples of Oregon.
California raises the best of wheat, and more
barley than any other state. Its vegetables and
fruits grow unusually large. In its southern districts figs and oranges are produced, and beautiful olive and almond trees yield abundantly.
California wines are famous.   The  mulberrytree flourishes, and silk-worms are raised on its
leaves.
8. The Precious Metals, gold and silver, are
found in many parts of this region. California
was long the foremost state in their p1roduction;
now Nevada is. Colorado ranks third. Utah and
Arizona are especially rich in silver-ores.
9. Soon after California was acquired from Mexico, a man
digging a mill-race noticed some sparkling particles in the
sand. They turned out to be gold. The whole country was
soon alive with diggers, seeking their fortunes. Gold was
afterward found in various other places-on both sides of the
Sierra, in the Rocky Mountains, the Black Hills, Oregon, and
Washington Territory. Mining towns sprung up, sometimes
in a few weeks. Hence the rapid growth of California and
Colorado, and their cities; of Deadwood, Helena, Bois6 City,
the two Virginias, Eure'ka, Leadville, etc.
IO. Other Mlinerals. You have seen the backs
of looking-glasses. They are covered with a white
coat made from quicksilver, or mercury. This
metal is not a solid like iron, but a liquid; it is
also white, like silver.  Hence its name-quick,
or living, silver. California contains rich mines
of this metal; also, of copper, iron, and coal.
Wyoming has vast coal-beds and valuable deposits of various metals.
ii. Cities.   SAN  FRANCISCO, "the Golden
City," is the great metropolis.  PORTLAND is an
important shipping-point for the flour and lumber of Oregon.  DENVER is a busy center of trade
for the rich mining regions of Colorado.
SACRAMENTO contains the finest building west
of the Rocky Mountains-the Capitol of California (see p. 49). SANTA Ft, founded by the
Spanish, is, next to St. Augustine, the oldest city
in the United States.
Nevada, California, Colorado, and Montana, are
rich in both gold and silver; Utah and Arizona, especially in silver; Dakota, Idaho, and Oregon, in
gold.

LESSON XLIV.
i. Lines crossing the Maps.- You have no doubt
noticed lines crossing the maps you have studied,
and wondered what they are for. No such lines
are drawn on the earth's surface, but we imagine
them to be there, and represent them on maps.
The lines that run up and down are called Meridians. The numbers that denote them stand at
the top. The lines that extend from right to left
are called Parallels, The numbers that denote
them are at the sides.
2. Their Use.-These lines are for the purpose of
showing where places are. If a sailor discovers a
new island away out in the ocean, how can he ever
find it again unless he has some means of locating
it?  If he knows it is on meridian 107 West and
parallel 20 North, he can easily go back to it.
3. Places that are on meridian Io07 West are said to be in
107 degrees West Iongitude. Places on parallel 20 North are
said to be in 20 deg,rees North Latitude. Find the point on the
map of North America that is in this latitude and longitude.
North America lies wholly in north latitude.
Where is Cape Farewell? What is its latitude? What
mountain is in nearly the same latitude?
4. Zones.-In the margins of the map of North
America you find the words Torrid Zone,'North
Temperate Zone.  Zones are belts of the earth's
surface in which the temperature is nearly the
same throughout-hot, or moderate, or cold.
5. The Torrid Zone.-Torrid means parched,
hot. The southern part of North America lies in
the Torrid Zone.  This zone, you will see, extends north to the line marked 23~ in the margin
and called the Trop'ic of Cancer.  What country
does this tropic cross?
6. The North Temperate Zone lies north of the
Tropic of Cancer.  Temperate means moderate,
and the climate of this zone is neither very hot
nor very cold.
The North Temperate Zone, you will see, extends north to the dotted line marked 66~ in the
margin and called the Arctic Circle. What countries does the Arctic Circle cross?
* These subjects are treated further on pp. 98, 99.
7. The North Frigid Zone.-North of the Arctic Circle is the North Frigid Zone.  Find these
words on the map. Frigid means cold. Many
of the waters in this cold zone are frozen over
during much of the year. Ships that go there
are often frozen in; the sailors sometimes have to
leave them in the ice, and hardly escape with
their lives. There are no green fields; in most
parts, no trees or bushes.
Of these three zones, which is the hottest? The coldest?
Which is the moderate one?  Which is farthest north? Farthest south? In what zone do you live? Point toward the
Torrid Zone. Point toward the North Frigid Zone.
In what zone is Central America?  In what zone is all of
the United States except Alaska? In what zones is Alaska?
Greenland? Iceland? Mexico? In what zone is most of
the Dominion of Canada? The city of Washington?
What line separates the Torrid Zone from the North Temperate Zone? The North Frigid Zone from the North Temperate Zone? Which is farther south, the Arctic Circle or the
Tropic of Cancer? Which is warmer, Mexico or the United
States? Central America or British Columbia?
Alaska lies in the North Frigid and the North
Temperate Zone. The rest of the United States is
in the North Temperate Zone.
COLD COUNTRIES OF NORTH AMERICA.
LESSON XLV.
HUNTING THE WALRUS.
I. The Cold Countries.- Let us first visit the
cold countries of the North. You will find many
places named after bold sailors who have pushed

up among the drifting ice to explore these regions. Behring, a Dane in the service of Peter
the Great, Czar of Russia, gave his name to the
sea and strait that separate Alaska from Asia; he
was wrecked, and died of hunger on a desolate island.  In
Hudson Bay, the same Henry
Hudson who  discovered the
Hudson River was set adrift in
an open boat by his mutinous
crew: he was never heard of
afterward.
2. Alaska is more than twice
as large as all the New England
and Middle Atlantic States together.  The Yukon is one of
the great rivers of the world.
You can ascend it for I,800
miles, but you will find no
thriving cities or villages on
its banks. Tlhere are several
volcanoes in Alaska.  Mount St. Elias, a peak
of the Coast Range, is the highest mountain in
North America.
3. In most parts of Alaska it is too cold to raise
grain or potatoes. Fish and furs are the wealth
of the country. Salmon and codfish are taken in
immense numbers. You have seen the handsome
seal-skin cloaks that ladies wear; many of these
are obtained from the seals of Alaska.
4. Walrus-hunting is carried on to some extent.
The walrus, found in different parts of the Arctic
regions, is nearly twice as long and heavy as a
horse. Like the seal, it lives in the water, but
comes up on the land and on the ice to rest.
The hunter then attacks it, for its tusks make
good ivory, and its oil, skin, and flesh, are all
valuable.  But walruses generally go in herds,
and they rally to defend one another and their
young. They deal stout blows with their tusks;
and unless the hunter has firearms, it sometimes
goes hard with him and his boat.
5. SITKA, the chief town of Alaska, is a rainy
place. It has two wet days for one that is clear.
6. The Dominion of Canada extends up into
the North Frigid Zone.  The coast is lined with
cold and barren islands. Among these, many
have tried to find a route between the two great
oceans; but one ship's company, however, has
ever succeeded in making the entire passage, and
they only after enduring many hardships.
ESQUXIMAU LIFE.
7. The Esquimaux  (es'ke-mo--  eaters of raw.flesh) are a peculiar people who-inhabit the northern shores from Behring Strait to Greenland.
The Esquimaux live by fishing and hunting, and move from
place to place wherever they can find seals and sea-birds.
They have fierce wolfish dogs, which they harness to sleds
and drive rapidly over the ice with long whips. Their winter
huts, partly underground, are covered with snow, and entered
on all-fours through long, tunneled passages. The whole family cook, eat, and sleep, in one small, filthy room. Blubber,
burned in a basin-like lamp with a wick of moss, serves as
fuel and light. The above engraving shows the inside and the
outside of an Esquimau hut. A party has just returned with
one of their dog-teams, bringing a seal that they have killed.
When food is plenty, the Esquimaux are great gluttons.
On the Esquimaux, consult Dr. Kane's "Arctic Explorations," vol. ii., pages I I3, I32.
8. Greenland is an immense island. The coasts
in the north abound in enormous glaciers, or solid
seas of ice.  No one has ever explored the interior.  There are a few settlements in the south,
and whalers visit the neighboring waters.
9. Whales are the largest of living creatures.
Some of them grow to be a hundred feet long.
They yield oil, whalebone, and spermaceti.  Forinerly many vessels were engaged in their capture,
but of late whales have become scarce. Kerosene
has to a great extent taken the place of whale-oil.Io. Iceland lies east of Greenland, and with
Greenland forms Danish America. It looks like
a small island on the map, but it is larger than
the whole state of Virginia. Desolate swamps,
glaciers, mountain-masses, and lava thrown up
by volcanoes, cover much of the surface. There
are no trees of any size; no roads, bridges, or
carriages. The people travel on horseback.
I i. Volcanoes and Geysers.-There are several
burning mountains, which sometimes have terrible
eruptions.   Mount Hecla is the most famous.
There are also wonderful geysers, which send up
columns of boiling water a hundred feet high.
i 2. The Icelanders depend chiefly on their domestic animals. They export wool and woolen
mittens, salted and dried fish, Iceland moss, and
eider-down.
Eider-down consists of the soft feathers of eider-ducks,
collected from their nests. The bird lines its nest with these
feathers, and, when they are removed, will pick more from its
breast and line it a second time. The nests are private property and are highly valued. There is a fine of thirty dollars
for killing an eider-duck.

THE DOMINION OF CANADA.
LESSON XLVI.
I. Features of Different Sections.-The northern part of the Dominion of Canada, bordering
on the Arctic waters and occupied only by scattered tribes of Esquimaux, is cold, barren, and
unimportant. But, as we go south, we enter regions valuable for their martens, minks, beavers,
and other fur-bearing animals. Nearer still to
the United States we come to forests of excellent
timber, to thriving farms and flourishing villages.
In the southeastern part are large cities, connected by railroads and actively engaged in commerce
and manufactures.
2. Political Condition.-Canada did not join in
the American Revolution when the other British
colonies declared their independence. It remained
under the mother-country, and is still subject to
Great Britain.  Hence this part of America is
sometimes called British America, and the provinces of the Dominion are known as the British
Provinces.
3. How made up.-The Dominion of Canada
is nearly as large as the United States. It contains seven provinces, besides extensive territories
out of which other provinces will some day be
made. British Columbia and Manitoba (man-eto'ba), which are shown on the map of North
America, are provinces of Canada; in what part
of the Dominion are they?
4. The five Southeastern Provinces-Ontario,
Quebec, New Bruniswick, No'va Sco'tia, and Prince
Edward Island-are shown in the map on the
opposite page.  They extend from  the Albany
River on the northwest, to the United States, the
Atlantic, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
5. Government.-Each of the seven provinces
has its own Legislature, or law-making body, and
its own capital.. The Dominion has a Parliament, which regulates its affairs as a whole, and
in which each province is represented. The
Governor-General is appointed by the British
crown. The capital of the Dominion of Canada
is OTTAWA.
To what, in the United States, do the Canadian provinces
correspond? To what body does the Parliament correspond?
To what officer does the Governor-General correspond?
Map Questions.-Which of the Canadian provinces borders
on the Great Lakes? Which is traversed by the River St.
Lawrence? Which border on the New England States? Which
shares with New York in the Falls of Niagara? What river
in part separates Ontario from Quebec? Bound Quebec.
To what river does Ontario extend on the north? What is
the principal river of New Brunswick? Bound New Brunswick. What is the chief seaport of New Prunswick? Near
what bay is St. John? At the mouth of what river? Bound
Nova Scotia. What city is its capital and chief seaport?
The Dominion of Canada is part of the British
Empire.  It is made up of seven provinces and
extensive territories. -Its capital is Ottawa. Its
largest city is Montreal. Its chief seaports are St.
John and Halifax.

Having measured the length and width of your schoolroom, of its windows, door, desks, etc., draw a map of the
whole, on the scale of an inch to a foot.
How many inches long is your map? How many wide?
How many windows does your map show? How many desks?
In what direction is the door from the center of the room?
Point out on the map the seat you occupy.*
The teacher places the diagram on
the blackboard, and calls on one of the
class to write at the end of each line the
name of the direction in which it points.
In what direction does your schoolhouse face? Toward what direction is
its rear? How many windows open on
the east side? On the west? What part
of the grounds is toward the north? Toward the south? Toward the east'? To.
ward the west?

books at p. 6. What are shown in the picture? What objects
do you see in these school-grounds? Suppose the school-house
to face the south; in what direction from the school-house is
the pump? The diamond-shaped plot? The left-hand tree?
The right-hand tree? In what direction are the two bushes?
With your measure find how many yards long and wide
your school-grounds are.
* NOTE.-To prevent erroneous notions with regard to direction, the first maps should always be drawn or suspended
on the north wall of the room, so that the east and west of
the map may be toward the east and west. When the idea
that the top of the map is always north, and the right hand
east, is fully established, this caution need not be observed.
Draw an outline of your school-grounds, on the scale of an
inch to the yard. How many yards is your school-house from
the north fence-from the south fence-from the east fencefrom the west fence?  Represent your school-house on the
map just drawn.
What other objects are in your school-yard? Measure
the distance of each from the nearest fence; locate it on the
map.
By what are the school-grounds represented in the picture
on p. 6 surrounded? Why is a fence put round them?
Where do the grounds end? What is north of them, on
the map?  What is east of them? South of them?  West
of them? We call these the Boundaries of the grounds.
When we tell what adjoins the grounds on each side in
order, we bound the grounds. The school-grounds in this map
are bounded north by Jacob Pond's field, east by Plum Lane,
south by Main Street, and west by the Meeting-House grounds.
Bound the lot on which your school stands.
Bound the lot or farm on which your house stands.*
IF. JV4TURAIL DIVISIORS.
For the pupil to read.
In going home from school, we follow streets
or roads running through the land.  But on our
way, or if we continue our course, we may come
to some stream or pond. This is water. Land
and water make up the surface around us.
* NOTE.-The school-district is next to be considered. A
wider range is now given to the exercises on direction, distance, and boundaries. The pupils may be questioned on the
directions in which they live from each other; the directions
in which the principal streets or roads run; the distance between well-known points; the boundaries of the school-district, etc.

6DESCRIPTIVE MATTER.
LESSON XLVIII.
1. Surface.-Soil.-The southeastern Canadian
provinces are level. Good crops of grain and potatoes are raised, and excellent pasturage is found.
South and west of Lake Winnipeg are fertile prairies and the best of wheat-land.  British Columbia is mountainous, but adapted to stock-raising.
2. The Climate is severe in winter. Snow falls
abundantly, but is very useful. It protects the
wheat sown in autumn.  It makes traveling easy.
It helps the farmer in bringing his produce to market, and the lumberman in drawing out his logs.
The summers are hot, and ripen the crops rapidly.
3. The People.-If you should ask the inhabitants where they came from, most of them would
say that they or their forefathers came from England, Ireland, or Scotland. There are many of
French descent; Canada once belonged to France.
4. Not a few Indians, also, live in Canada.
Some have learned to cultivate farms. Others
rove about where they can hunt and trap to the
best advantage. They exchange their furs with
white traders for firearms, blankets, knives, tobacco, etc. None of the Canadian Indians are so
troublesome as the Indians of the United States.
5. Minerals. -Coal is wanting in Quebec, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island, but is found

in the other provinces. Silver-ore is obtained
near Lake Superior, and copper on the Mackenzie River. Gold deposits have attracted miners
to British Columbia.  When the Canadians have
finished their great railroad from Lake Superior
to the Pacific, rich mineral treasures will soon be
brought to light.
6. Lumbering is one of the principal occupations. A great raft of logs, such as is often met
with on the St. Lawrence River, is a striking
sight.  With its rough shanties, its blazing fires,
its sails spread to the wind, its holiday flags, and
its busy crew piloting it along, it looks almost
like a floating village.
7. The Fisheries are an important interest.
The salmon of British  Columbia, and the cod,
mackerel, and herring, of the eastern coast, keep
many persons employed in catching and salting
them, and are among the leading exports of the
Dominion.
8. Furs are another valuable product of Canada.  Thousands of hnnters and trappers, including Indians, are engaged in the capture of furbearing animals, such as you see grouped in the
engraving below.
As the hunter has to visit his traps
scattered through the wilderness for
many miles, in the depth of the northern winter, he has not a very easy life.
Sometimes he meets a bear or hungry
wolves; and often the crafty wolverene
makes the rounds of his traps before
him, and steals away the animals that
have been caught.
The Hudson Bay Company, which
has long had control of the fur-trade
in this region, has a hundred and fifty
posts in different parts of the Dominion. A post consists of a storehouse
and a few dwellings surrounded by palisades; it is generally erected on a river,
so as to be easily reached. The skins
are brought in by the trappers to the
various posts, from which they are collected, and sent principally to London,
the chief fur-market of the world.
Lumber, wheat and flour, dairy
products, salted fish, and furs, are
THE TRAPPER.    the leading exports of the Dominion of Canada.
58LESSON XLIX.
i. Chief Cities of Canada.-(Describe the situation of each.) OTTAWA, the capital, is noted for
its handsome government buildings.
2. MONTREAL is the first city of Canada in
size and extent of commerce.
NEW CATHEDRAL, MONTREAL (IN COURSE OF ERECTION).
3. QUEBEC, the capital of the province of Quebec, is a quaint old city.   It ranks second in
population  and  commercial importance, and is
one of the greatest lumber-markets in America.
The citadel of Quebec is on the heights above the lower
city, and is strongly fortified. Here, more than a hundred
years ago, occurred the famous battle between the English
general, Wolfe, and the French general, Montcalm (montkalhn'), which cost each his life.
The French, regarding the heights on which their citadel
was perched as secure, had left them but slightly guarded.
Wolfe, repulsed in other quarters and almost in despair, at
length determined to attempt a surprise. One dark night he
silently landed his army at the base of the steep bluff that
rose from the river's edge, and at dawn it was drawn up in
battle array on the top. In the conflict that followed, the
English were victorious, and since then Canada has belonged
to Great Britain.- Consult Bryant's "Popular History of the
United States," vol. iii., p. 304.
4. TORONTO, the capital of Ontario, noted for
its university, is the third city of the Dominion.
5. HALIFAX  is the capital and largest city of
Nova Scotia.  ST. JOHN is the metropolis of New
Brunswick.   Both have  excellent harbors, and
carry on an extensive foreign and coasting trade.
6. Newfoundland.-You have seen Newfoundland dogs, and have read about their saving persons fronm  drowning.  They get their name from
an island that we found on the map of North
America.
Newfoundland is larger than Ohio. It is not
part of Canada, but is a distinct British colony.
Labrador, a barren region on the mainland near
by, is included in the same government.
7. The fish that frequent their coasts are the
wealth of Newfoundland and Labrador.  When
Cab'ot first visited the Banks of Newfoundland,
six years after Columbus discovered America, he
reported meeting " such multitudes of big fishes
that they did sometimes stop the ship".  This
is a hard story to believe; but certain it is that
these banks have teemed with codfish ever since.
REVIEW.--Name the five southeastern Provinces of Canada, with the capital and largest town of each.
Name the six principal cities of Canada.
Memorize the names of the following natural divisions in
connection with Canada, and describe the situation of each:Islands.-PRINCE EDWARD, CAPE BRETON.
Bays.-JAMES, GEORGIAN, FUNDY.
Gulf.-ST. LAWRENCE.
Rivers.-ST. LAWRENCE, OTTAWA, SAGUENAY, ST. JOHN.
MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA.
LESSON L.
I. The Hot Countries.-We have been up in
the cold North.  We shall now take a trip south,
to the hot countries of North America.
2. Mexico.-Crossing the Rio Grande, we first
enter Mexico.  We soon find that we are in a
strange land.  We traverse high  sandy plains
covered with the prickly pear, a kind of cactus,
which has no  leaves, but sends out flattened
thorny joints one from another. Elsewhere luscious fruits abound.  In the lowlands we meet
with the cocoa-palm, mahogany, and many other
trees that are new to us. The forests are gay
with bright-colored parrots and humming-birds.
The country houses are built of a mixture of
mud and gravel dried in the sun, and, on account
of the frequent earthquakes, are only one story
high.  The Indians of the mountain districts
59are  of  a different  race  from  ourselves.  The
whites, sprung mostly from Spaniards, speak the
Spanish language. The ladies smoke cigarettes.
Goods are carried on the backs of mules. Wild
horses roam  over the plains.  Here and there a
ranch (stock-farm) meets the view, with its big
corral, or inclosure, full of cattle.
Map Questions.-(See Map of North America, p. 53.) In
what direction is Mexico from New England? From Alaska?
On what waters would you sail in going from Vera Cruz to
New York?  In going from San Francisco to Cape St. Lucas?
What two peninsulas partly inclose the Gulf of Mexico?
In what direction is Yucatan from Florida? In what zone is
Yucatan? In what zone is Florida?  In what zones is the
Gulf of Mexico? In what zone is the greater part of the
Gulf of Mexico?
Using the scale of miles, find how long Mexico is from
northwest to southeast. Find its greatest breadth from east
to west. Draw the outline of Mexico as nearly as you can on
the blackboard. Locate the capital and Vera Cruz.
3. Size.-Surface.-Mexico is about four times
as large as California. It is mostly a plateau,
traversed by mountain-ranges. A line of volcanoes, embracing two of the loftiest peaks in North
America, crosses the country. The coasts are low
and unhealthy.
4. Productions.-The products of the soil are
various; the hot lowlands yield those of the Torrid Zone, the higher grounds those of temperate
regions.  Sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, tobacco, indigo, and the caca'o, from the beans of which
chocolate is made, grow luxuriantly. Corn is
the principal grain; in some sections four crops
are harvested in
a year.
5 Cochineal,
which  yields  a
rich crimson dye,
is a valuable export.  This is an
insect that lives
on a kind of cactus cultivated in
plantations   for
its support. The
insects are picked
off with a blunt
Tiz COCHrNEAL CACTUS.      knife and dried.
6. Pulque (pull'lcay) is a favorite drink in
Mexico. It is the fermented juice of the American al'oe, which is cultivated in Mexico and Central America for the sake of producing this wine.
A single plant, when ready to flower, will yield
two gallons of juice a day for several months.
The aloe, and Mexicans engaged in making pulque, are shown in the engraving on p. 62.  A
kind of brandy is made by distilling pulque.
7. Minerals.-Mexico is a storehouse of mineral treasures.  Its silver-mines were once the
richest in the world, and still produce largely.
Gold and quicksilver, copper and tin, and the
pearls of Lower California, add to its wealth.
8. Government.-Like the United States, Mexico is made up of different states joined in one
republic.' Civil wars have been frequent.
9. Chief Cities.-MExICo, the capital, is about
as large as New Orleans. It stands on higher
ground than the highest peak east of the Mississippi. Throughout the year, fruits and flowers
in wonderful variety make its markets and streets
attractive.
VERA CRUZ is the chief seaport.
Vera Cruz was founded by the Spanish leader Cortez, who
landed there in I5I9. With about six hundred men he undertook to conquer the great empire of the Aztecs, who then
ruled Mexico, with its millions of souls. He succeeded within
three years, after a terrible struggle. The Aztecs had never
seen a horse or a gun. Horse and rider they looked on as one
animal, and the discharges of the Spaniards' firearms as the
thunder of the gods. From the time of Cortez Mexico belonged to Spain, till about sixty years ago, when the people
freed themselves from their Spanish rulers.
The Republic of Mexico has the city of Mexico
for its capital. Vera Cruz is its largest seaport.
Corn is its staple grain.  Silver is the chief of its
many mineral treasures. The prickly pear is a national emblem.

m. Central America.-Crossing the southeastern boundary of Mexico, we enter Central America. Find it on the map of North America, p. 53.
In what direction is it from Washington? From
San Francisco? Point toward Central America.
In what zone is it?
2. Central America is shown on a larger scale
in the map above. Like Mexico, it was early settled by Spaniards and for many years belonged to
Spain. Before studying the map, it will be well
to learn how to spell and pronounce some of the
proper names.
Balize, bM-leez'.
Guatemala, gywah-tay-mah' lah.
Honduras, hon-doo'rcas.
San Salvador, sahn sahl-v6-dow'.

Tegucigalpa,  tay-goo-seLeon, le'on.    [gah'lpah.
Managua, mnah-nah'gwah.
San Jos6, saln ho-say'.
4. How made up.-Surface.-Central America
consists of the British colony of Balize and five
republics; name these.  It is mountainous, and
contains several volcanoes.
5. Earthquakes are frequent. A terrible earthquake destroyed Guatemala, the former capital
of Guatemala. Eight times has the city of San
Salvador suffered from disastrous shocks.
6. Products, etc.- The mahogany used for furniture is obtained with great labor and risk of
health from the swampy coast-forests of Honduras and Balize.  Indigo and sarsaparilla are
also valuable products of Central America.  The
soil, though rudely cultivated, yields corn, rice,
sugar-cane, cotton, tobacco, and coffee, in abundance. Commerce and manufactures are neglected.
7. The West Indies.-On the map of North
America you will find some islands called the
West Indies.  How are they situated?  Learn
from the map the names of the four largest West
India Islands.
8. Cuba and Porto Rico (porl'to re'ko) belong
to Spain. Jamaica is a British colony. Hayti
(ha'te) is divided between two republics of blacks.
These islands are the great sugar-cane region of
the world.  Their tobacco and tropical fruits
(oranges, lemons, pineapples, bananas, etc.) are
also famous.
New Guatemala is the finest city of Central America. Havana, noted for its sugar and cigars, is the
metropolis of the West Indies, and a great commercial city.
3. Map Questions.- Which of the Central American
countries extends farthest north? Which extends farthest south? Farthest east? Farthest west?
Which border on the Pacific? Which border on the
Caribbean Sea? Which border on Mexico?
Which is the largest? Which is the smallest?
Name the capital of each Central American country.
In what direction is New Guatemala from San Salvador? Managua from Tegucigalpa? Balize from San
Jose? Describe the Bay of Honduras.
How is Lake Nicaragua situated? Into what sea does
its'outlet empty?

scene; the vegetation, the buildings, and the dress of the natives, are quite different from ours, In the center is a winter
view on the Pacific Railroad. The trains, crossing high mountain-ranges, sometimes encounter violent snow-storms, and snowplows can hardly be forced through the drifts by the most powerful locomotives.

62SOU'TH AMERICA.
LESSON LIII.
I. South America.-Looking at the map of
North America, p. 53, you may wonder that Central America, lying so far south, is called Central. But really it is central, for America extends
south of it more than four thousand miles. The
part to the south is called SOUTH AMERICA. It
forms a new Grand Division, which we are now
going to visit.
2. Isthmus of Panama.  North and South
America are connected, as you see, by a narrow
strip of land. A neck like this, connecting two
larger bodies of land, is called an Isthmus. This
isthmus is known as the Isthmus of Panama.
3. Proposed Ship-Canal.-Turn now to p. 65,
and you will see South America and the isthmus
which joins it to North America. A ship sailing from a port in the eastern part of the United States and bound for the Pacific would save
thousands of miles, if it could reach that ocean
without going around South America. To enable it to do so, it is proposed to cut a ship-canal
through the Isthmus of Panama.
4. The Western Continent.-North and South
America together form what is called a Continent
-one of the two largest divisions of land in the
world. Each continent is surrounded by water,
and is really a very large island.  North and
South America form the WESTERN CONTINENT.
5. The Torrid Zone.-Central America is in
the Torrid Zone. Looking at the margin of the
map of South America, we find that the Torrid
Zone extends to the dotted line marked 23j and
called the Tropic of Cap'ricorn.
6. Midway between the tropics is a black line
marked 0 in the margin and called the Equator.
The Torrid Zone, then, is bounded by the two
tropics, and traversed midway by the -Equator.
7. The South Temperate Zone.-In North America we found that it grows colder as we go north.
As soon as we pass the Equator, it becomes cooler
as we go south. South of the Tropic of Capricorn we enter the South Temperate Zone. If we
keep on to the south, we shall come to the South
Frigid Zone, with glaciers and icebergs, seals and
whales, like those of the North Frigid.
In the South Temperate Zone the season is the
opposite of ours; it is winter when we have summer, spring when we have autumn, etc.
(PRefer to map, p. 65.) In what zone is the northern part
of South America?  The southern part?  The greater part?
What part of South America is hottest? What part is coldest?  Which is warmer, Brazil or the Dominion of Canada?
Places south of the Equator are said to be in South latitude. What three countries does parallel Io South cross?
What parallel crosses the southern part of Peru?
Meridian 77 West runs near Lima (le'mah) in Peru. This
is the meridian on which Washington stands; Lima, then, is
in about the'same longitude as what city?
Meridians run north and south. In what direction is Lima
from Washington? What meridian crosses eastern Brazil?
8. Proper Names.-The Spanish and Portuguese first settled South America. They have
left there some names difficult to pronounce.
Learn to spell and pronounce the following:Aconcagua, ah-kon-kah'gwah.
Argentine, ar'jen-tine.
Asuncion, ah-soon-se-own'.

LESSON LVI.
I. Surface.-The western part of South America is mountainous.   The rest, except portions
of northern and eastern Brazil, is level. The central part, from Venezuela to Patagonia, consists
mainly of low plains.
2. The Andes are the chief mountains of South
America. They are a continuation of the Rocky
Mountain  System  of North America, and run
close to the Pacific coast throughout its length.
They are the longest range in the world, extending about 4,500 miles.  The Andes are also very
high. Some of their
summits rise more than
four miles above the
level of the sea, and
are covered with snow
that never melts.  Bolivia and Chili contain
the  highest peaks in
America.
3. Volcanoes.-Fifty
or more volcanoes are
found among the Andes.   Some  of these
are constantly smoking,
while others have violent eruptions and are
then  quiet for years.                 \
Sometimes torrents of
water are sent forth;
mud  and  myriads of
fish have also been discharged.  
Chimborazo and Cotopaxi            FA OUS ON A

the air is so rare that it is  track. The long woolly hair of 1
hard to breathe; blood oozes  skin is made into leather, and its
from the lips and ears.
Cotopaxi is the most formidable of all the burning mountains of the Andes. Its smoke and ashes sometimes spread
the darkness of night around, and a hundred miles away its
roars are heard like the discharges of cannon.
4. Earthquakes.--As in all volcanic countries,
earthquakes are frequent. A few years ago a terrible shock destroyed many towns along the coast
from Colombia to Chili, and killed 50,000 persons.
5. The Slopes of the Andes are very steep. In
many parts there are no roads. Goods have to be
carried on the backs of mules and llamas; and
travelers, in chairs lashed to the backs of natives.
Ropes suspended over chasms so deep that the eye
can hardly reach the bottom, are sometimes the
only bridges. Railroads have been built, however, among the mountains of Peru.
6. Rainless Region.-The winds, charged with
moisture from the Atlantic and the great rivers,
part with it on the eastern slopes of the An-.......des.  A great deal of
rain falls there, while
most of the Pacific coast
of Peru and Bolivia is
rainless.
7. Rivers.-The important rivers are all
east of the Andes. The
largest are the Amazon,
the Orinoco, and the
Rio de la Plata. With
their branches they
reach to the heart of
South America, opening an easy way for
commerce.
The Amazon is one of the
longest rivers in the world,
and pours more water into
the ocean than any other.

Lake Maracaybo. They consist of huts built on piles.
The Rio de la Plata (silver river) was so called from the
silver ornaments worn by the natives on its banks when the
Spaniards discovered it.
668. Plains.--Each of the three great rivers traverses extensive plains.
9. The grassy plains of the Orinoco have no
trees, but in the rainy season are overgrown with
dense herbage. During the intense heat of the
dry season this withers and dies, and the herds
that fed on it have to find pasturage in the highlands.
io. The forest plains along the Amazon produce a thick growth of immense trees.  Woven
together with climbing vines and tangled underbrush, these form walls of vegetation that only
wild beasts can penetrate.  The spotted jaguar,
the deer for which it lies in wait, the long-nosed
tapir, the chattering monkey,, the terrible anaconda, the lazy alligator, the noisy parrot, brightwinged humming-birds, and myriads of insects,
lend life to these dense forests.
II. The pampas of the La Plata produce no
trees, but yield a coarse grass which grows six
feet high and supports cattle without number.
These are slaughtered by thousands for their hides.
The unsold meat is used for manure.
The great mountain-system of South America is
that of the Andes, containing the loftiest peaks in
the Western Continent.
The three largest rivers are the Amazon, the
Orinoco, and the Rio de la Plata. The Amazon and
its branches drain a thir,1 part of South America.

I. The Forests of South America are rich in
valuable woods.  Their chief ornament is the
palm. Its different parts furnish the Indian with
food, drink, and materials for clothing, cordage,
weapons, hammocks, mats, baskets, etc. Here,

2. The Cultivated Products are those of both
the Torrid and the Temperate Zone. This is the
case even within the tropics; for in the mountainous districts it becomes cooler as we ascend,
and we have different kinds of vegetation.
In the warmer regions corn is the principal
grain, and rice, coffee, sugar, cotton, tobacco, and
tropical fruits, are raised in abundance. Here,
as in Mexico, the banana is an important article
of food; an acre of bananas yields as much nourishment as twenty-five acres of wheat. From the
root of the ma'nio, a shrub that grows wild in
Brazil and  is cultivated elsewhere, meal is prepared, on which a large part of the people subsist.
Farther south are the grains of temperate regions.  Chili is noted for its wheat; and Paraguay for its mate' (mah'tay), used instead of tea.
3. Minerals.-Silver is the most valuable mining product of South America. The richest deposits are in  Chili, Peru, and Bolivia.   Five
thousand silver-mines have been worked during
the last three hundred years near Potosi, in Bolivia, and some of them are still productive.
They were discovered by an Indian, who grasped
67In some parts of the country, boys have great
sport in coasting; that is, in riding on sleds down
a hill covered with snow or ice. They go very fast.
When we ride up-hill in a wagon, we have to go
slowly. I know what a hill is. It is made up of, and is raised higher than the surface around.
When we have gone all the way up a hill, we
have reached the top.  When we have gone all the
way down, we have reached the bottom. Between
the top and the bottom are the sides, or slopes.
A hill is a division of land. It is not made
by man, but by nature.  We call it a Natural
Division.   There  are  other  natural  divisions,
about which we must learn.
MODEL FOR ORAL EXERCISES.
If an elevation of land is so high that you would have to
travel several hours to reach the top, what is it called? A
iAountain. Which is higher, a Mountain or a hill?
Have you ever seen a chain?  Of what is it made up?
When mountains are joined together, like links in a chain, and
extend in one direction perhaps for many miles, what do they
form? Have you ever seen a Chain, or Range, of mountains?
Turn to the map on p. 53; point out the mountain-ranges.
Turn to pages 62 and 72, and you will see how mountains
look in pictures. Point out the mountains in these pictures.
Do you prefer riding on level land or up and down hills?
What is a tract of level land called? A Plain. What is level
land between hills or mountains called?  A Valley.
How does a meadow look? Suppose a meadow, covered
with grass and wild flowers, to extend in every direction farther than you can see; it would be called a Prairie. Now
imagine a large tract covered with deep sand instead of grass;
would anything grow in it? What name is applied to a dry,
barren plain? Would you like to travel through a Desert?

ever seen an island?  Where?  Now turn to the map on p.
53, and find Iceland. What is Iceland? How do you know
Iceland is an island? Point to other islands on this map.

PICTURE OF A PENINSULA, AN ISTHMUS, AND A CAPE.
Look at the picture in the right-hand column of p. 7. Is
that long piece of land an island? Why not? This piece of
land, which is almost an island, we call a Penzinsula. We call
the neck that connects it with the mainland an Isthmus. Point
to the isthmus.
What objects do you see on the peninsula? The strip of
land bordering the water is called the Shore. What stands
on the shore of the peninsula?  The point at the end of the
peninsula is called a Cape. Into what does the Cape project?
Turn to the map, p. 53. Find all the peninsulas on the map;
in what direction does each project? Find the isthmuses.*
* NOTE.-The natural divisions of water may be treated in
a similar way. With a stream near by, it will be easy to develop ideas represented by the terms current, up and dlowlnbanks, right and left-branch, source, bed, and mouth. The
way in which streams are formed from springs, and the reason why they take the courses that they do, may be explained,
and the names Brook, Creek, and River applied.
Observation of the relations of the land to the water along
the stream will assist in forming ideas of a Bay, a Gulf, a
Strait, and a Chainnel.
A neighboring pond will serve as a basis for conveying the
notion of a Lake; in connection with which, the meaning of
the words inlet and outlet may be made clear.-In every case
illustrate with pictures (see p. 8), and refer to a map, as before.
A most interesting means of illustration may be easily provided, by procuring some molding-sand, and a large pan, or
flat piece of wood with raised border. The pupils may then
be called on to mold hills, mountains, mountain-chains, valleys, plains--to form islands, peninsulas, isthmuses, capes-to
show lakes, bays, straits, rivers, etc. In like manner, the
school-district or the township, with its reliefs and natural
divisions, may be represented.
7a bush to keep himself from  falling.
The bush came up in his hand, and particles of silver were found adhering to the root.
4. Gold deposits occur in Chili and the mountainous countries to the north, also in Brazil.
Chili is famous for its copper. Other minerals
are found in different quarters, but mining is not
largely carried on except in Peru and Chili.  The
diamonds of Brazil and the emeralds of Colombia
are much esteemed.
5. Inhabitants.- Among the inhabitants, particularly in the mountainous districts, are many
Indians. Some of these know little more than
how to bring down birds with their long blowguns and poisoned arrows (see engraving)-or, as
in Patagonia, to hunt the ostrich and other game,
at the full speed of their wild horses. Others are
partly civilized and used to labor.
The whites have sprung mainly from Spanish
settlers, or have come from countries across the
Atlantic. In Brazil there are many negroes, while
most of the whites are of Portuguese descent.
6. Occupations.-Agriculture and cattle-raising
are the chief pursuits.  Manufactures are imported, and the products of the herds, fields,
forests, and mines, exported. Hides and tallow
go from Venezuela, the Argentine Republic, Uruguay, and Brazil; guano and the precious metals,
BLOV'"-    from  Peru; wheat and copper, from
Chili; coffee and cocoa, from the northwestern countries.
Brazil has the most extensive commerce. It
furnishes more than half the coffee used in the
world, and exports, besides, sugar, cotton, Indiarubber, etc. Most of its flour it gets from the
United States.
7. Forms of Government.-Brazil is ruled by
an emperor,- and is called an Empire.  The emperor is not chosen by the people, but receives
the crown from  his father.  Guiana consists of
three colonies belonging to the English, Dutch,
and French.  All the other countries are republics, except Patagonia, a barren land claimed by
both Chili and the Argentine Republic.
8. Cities.-The largest city of South America
is Rio JANEIRO, the capital of Brazil; it is about
the size of Baltimore.
The following cities, most of which owe their
importance to their commerce, have each more
than Ioo,ooo inhabitants: BUEXos AYRES, SANTIAGO (the largest city west of the Andes), BAIHIA,
PERNAMBUCO, MONTEVIDEO, LIMA, and VALPARAISO. Describe the situation of each.
PANAMA is at the end of a railroad across the
Isthmus. It is connected by steamers with San
Francisco, Valparaiso, and other ports.

IDESCRIPTIVE MATTER.
LESSON LXII.
I. Surface.-Most of Europe is level and low.
One may travel from the English Channel to the
Ural Mountains-through northern France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, the northern part of
the German Empire, and Russia-without having
to cross a mountain.   The  Caspian  Sea and a
large tract northwest of it are below sea-level.
Part of Holland, also, is lower than the ocean,
and has to be protected from its waves by dikes.
2. Mountains.   The
Cau'casus  Mountains,
on the boundary of Asia,
contain the loftiest peak...
in Europe.
The highest mountains wholly in Europe   
are  the  Alps.   Their
sublime scenery draws  
thousands to  Switzer-               b s       n
land every year. Grand
snow- crowned   peaks
are  interspersed  with
green valleys, where the
cattle and goats feed,   
and  with  picturesque
cabins, where the mountaineer turns their milk
into butter and cheese.
3. Many have lost their lives in trying to ascend Mount
Blanc, the highest peak of the Alps. Numerous carriageroads and three railroads have been built through the passes
of this chain. In one of the passes, the Great Saint Ber'nard,
the highest inhabited spot of Europe, live some good monks,
who keep dogs to rescue travelers overtaken by sudden snowstorms.-Immense masses of snow sometimes break off from
the mountain-sides in avalanchess, and plunge into the valleys,
crushing forests and burying villages.
The Alps are the home of the wary chamois; also of a large
species of vulture, which makes havoc among the sheep and
goats, and is said sometimes even to carry off infants in its talons.
4. Map Questions.-Name four mountain-ranges of Europe
that extend from east to west. Name two ranges that run
northwest and southeast. What two ranges run nearly north
and south? What is the general direction of the mountainsystems of North America? Of the principal mountain-system of South America?
5. Volcanoes. -  Mount Vesuvius and  Mount
Etna are volcanoes, which have eruptions from
time to time. Eighteen hundred years ago, during a terrible eruption of Vesuvius, three cities
were buried in cinders and ashes. For hundreds
of years they lay forgotten, till in digging a
ditch some ruins were discovered. One of these
ancient cities was then dug out. It is interesting to see its streets, houses, temples, and shops,
just as they were so long ago.
6. Seas, Gulfs, Bays. -Observe how many seas,
gulfs, and bays, indent the coast of Europe.
These indentations furnish many good harbors,
on which great cities have grown up by their
trade. They have helped to make Europe the
most important Grand Division of the Old World.
The Caspian Sea, though salt, is really a lake, for
it is not an arm of any larger body of water.
7. Rivers.-Europe has many navigable rivers,
by  which  the interior of the  country can  be
reached. The Volga,................   which     is   the     longest
river, is noted for its
salmon  and sturgeon,
the Danube for its commerce, and the Rhine
for its fine scenery and
old ruins.

72LESSON LXIII.
I. The Climate of Europe
is cold in the north, which is
crossed by the Arctic Circle.
It is moderate in the middle
regions, and warm and genial
in the south, which is sheltered from north winds by
the mountain-ranges running east and west.  The
climate is much milder than
in corresponding regions in
the New World. London is
farther north than any city
in America, but it is warmer
than Boston.
2. Productions.-As in
North America, the productions vary with the climate.
Along the cold shores of the
Arctic, vegetation is scanty;
and in Russia, desolate, treeLAPPS AND REINDEER.
The north of Norway and Sweden, and the adjacent part of Russia, are called Lapland. Here for some days in winter the sun does not rise at all. The people are called
Lapps; they are short and of a yellowish complexion. The sea Lapps live by fishing;
the mountain Lapps are supported by their herds of reindeer. They use the skin of this
animal for clothing, its sinews for thread, and its milk and flesh for food.
less plains occur. Thence we come in succession
to the region of barley, potatoes and oats, flax
and hemp, wheat, tobacco, corn, the vine-and
finally of the olive, fig, orange, and lemon.
3. Neither cotton nor sugar-cane is a staple of
Europe, though some cotton is produced in Turkey, Greece, and Italy. Sugar is made principally from the beet, which is largely raised for the
purpose in France, the German Empire, and Russia. The mulberry, on the leaves of which the
silk-worm  feeds, flourishes in southern Europe.
There are dense forests in parts of Russia and on
the mountain-slopes.
4. Northern Europe.-We must now look at the
separate countries. Let us begin at the north.
5. Norway and Sweden do not produce grain
enough for their own use. Forests, fisheries, and
mines, are important sources of wealth.  Many
cattle are raised in Norway.  Hundreds of vessels
frequent the Atlantic coast in the fishing season.
Sweden produces excellent iron, and Norway copper. Each makes its own laws, but Norway is
under the same king as Sweden.
6. Russia covers more than half of Europe.
It extends from the extreme north to the Black
Sea; hence there is great variety in the climate
and productions. Hemp and flax are among the
staples of middle Russia.  Southern Russia is an
excellent wheat region, Odessa on the Black Sea
being its chief shipping-point.
7. Cattle abound on the southern plains, and
are exported, together with hides, tallow, and timber.  Manufactures are rapidly increasing.
8. Of wild animals, the bear, found in the
mountains, is the emblem  of Russia.  Packs of
hungry wolves sometimes attack the solitary traveler, and fall upon the wild horses that roam
over the prairies.
9. Great fairs are a feature of the commerce of
Russia. Hundreds flock to them from distant parts
of Europe and Asia, to trade in all kinds of wares.
Io. Russia is a vast empire. The emperor is
generallyally called Czar.  ST. PETERSBURG, the capital, was founded by Peter the Great.  Moscow is
a large manufacturing and commercial city.
St. Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire, ranks fifth in size among the cities of Europe.
73LESSON LXIV.
I. Central Europe.-In Central Europe we have
the Austrian and the German Empire, the kingdoms of Denmark, Holland, and Belgium, and
the republics of Switzerland and France.
A kingdom is a country ruled by a king or queen.
2. Austria.-An empire is generally a government in which several distinct peoples or states
are united under one ruler. This is the case with
the Austrian Empire. One of its large divisions
is Hungary. Here the fertile soil produces wheat
in great abundance. The vine flourishes, and
noted wines are made.
3. In other parts, Austria is mountainous and
rich in minerals. Its manufactures of glass, linen,
etc., keep many persons employed. VIENNA, the
capital, is the third city of Europe in size.
4. The German Empire is made up of twentysix states. It contains extensive coal-fields, and
mountains abounding in minerals. More grain is
raised than is needed for home use. The vineyards along the Rhine are as famous as its ruined
castles.
5. Flax is a staple, and busy looms are everywhere at work, weaving it into linen. Sheep are
raised in great numbers, and yield superior wool,
which is partly exported and partly woven into
cloth. The Germans are ingenious manufacturers; they make many of our toys.  Great attention is paid to education.
6. BER'LIN, the capital of the empire, ranks
fourth among the European  cities; and HAMBURG, the chief seat of German commerce, is
third among European seaports.
7. Denmark, Holland, and Belgium, are well
adapted to agriculture. Both the Danes and the
Dutch (as the people of Holland are called) raise
many cattle, and among those on the coast fishing is an important business. The Dutch are a
thrifty people, and have shown great enterprise in
foreign commerce.
The Dutch need all the land they can get for tilling. How
do you think they have managed to make some of their most
fertile fields? They have built high banks round swamps and
lakes, and then pumped out the water by means of windmills.
Numerous canals traverse the country, on which both men and
women skate to market in winter, pushing before them sleds
loaded with produce. The land is very carefully cultivated.
Storks, tall solemn-looking birds with long bills, are very
common in Holland. They build their nests on the roofs of
houses, in city as well as country, and are thought to bring
good luck to the dwellings that they thus honor. To kill a
stork is forbidden under heavy penalties.
8. Belgium is rich in coal and iron. It is a
great manufacturing country, and contains more
people in proportion to its size than any other
land in the world. Fine laces and linens are
made in Belgium. Brussels carpets are so called
from the capital of Belgium, where they were first
made.
9. Switzerland is the Alpine Republic. Its people are noted for their love of freedom. Did you
ever hear of William Tell? Can you relate his
story? Even if, as some say, no such person ever
lived, the story gives us an idea of the spirit of
these hardy mountaineers.
Io. Many of the Swiss find employment in attending to their flocks and manufacturing. If
you enter a peasant's house, you will likely see
him carving some useful article or ornament out
of wood, and his wife and daughter embroidering,
spinning, or weaving. Swiss watches and jewelry
are much esteemed.
7475
I. France, extending from the North Sea to
the Mediterranean, produces the grains and rootcrops of central Europe and the fruits of the
south. The cultivation of grapes and the making of wine are leading industries. Vineyards
extend for miles over central France, and the
gathering of the grapes is a time of general merry-making.
12. Silk is an important product of France.
LYONS, the second city of the republic, is the
chief seat of the silk-manufacture; it may almost
be called a city of weavers.   Other important
manufactures are woolens, laces, and embroideries, jewelry and bronzes, kid gloves, etc. French
goods excel in taste and elegance.
I3. France has valuable iron-mines and rich
coal-fields.
14. PARIS, the French capital, is the gayest
and most delightful city of Europe.  MARSEILLES,
on the Mediterranean, is the most important seat
of the large foreign commerce of France.

LESSON LXV.
I. Southern Europe.-We have now reached
the countries of Southern Europe. These are
the principalities of Rouma'nia, Bulga'ria, Servia,
and IMontenegro--the empire of Turkey-and the
kingdoms of Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.
2. General Description.-This region is mostly
high, and much of it mountainous. Its climate
is mild, its vegetation luxuriant.  Manufactures
are few.  The people till the fertile soil, and get::-~ ~rNzE/.-~G'~-e,; ~abundant returns,
though they know
nothing of the mowers, reapers, and other improved
implements, which we are accustomed to see in this
country.  Wines, olive-oil, fruits, grain, silk, and
wool, are the most valuable products for export.
3. The Principalities are governed by sovereigns called Princes, who are really kings. Roumania, Bulgaria, and Servia, were formerly included in Turkey, but are now independent.
Horses and cattle abound in Bulgaria and Servia.
The little state of Montenegro is mountainous;
its name means black mountatns.  Mountaineers
love freedom, and the Montenegrins have fought
bravely for theirs against Turkey on many fields.
4. Turkey is called the Ottoman Empire, from
a chief who founded it.  It embraces more territory elsewhere than it has in Europe.  The
ruler is styled Sul'tan.  The people are often
cruelly oppressed.
5. Turkey has valuable minerals, a fine situation for commerce, a productive soil; but the
people are indolent and ignorant, and do not turn
these advantages to account.
6. Turkey carpets and Turkey morocco are the
best-known manufactures. Roses are cultivated
in large fields, and from their leaves the perfumeBSEFORE TIIE KREMLIN, MO10SCOW, ON EASTER-E VEN.
ITALIAN PEASANTS AND SCENERY.
THE Kremlin, the ancient citadel of Moscow, is surrounded by high walls. It is an irregular pile of churches, monasteries,
and public buildings, including an arsenal and palaces. With such reverence is its chief gate regarded that even the Czar
uncovers his head as he passes through it. Before the Kremlin, on Easter-even, the people of Moscow assemble at midnight
with torches, to celebrate the festival.
known as at'tari of roses is distilled. CONSTANTINOPLE, the capital, has a fine harbor called "the
Golden Horn ".
7. The Turks were a fierce people, who came into Europe
from the East several hundred years ago and seized on this
pleasant land. For a time they threatened to overrun all Europe. Latterly their power and dominions have diminished.
The Turks are Mohammedans, or believers in Mohammed, who
claimed to be a great prophet and founded a religion of his
own. Their sacred book is the Koran, which they think was
given to Mohammed directly from  Heaven.  Mohammedan
churches are called mosques.
8. Greece.--In Greece flourished of old the most
cultivated of nations. ATHENS, the present capital, was once a magnificent city of temples and
statues, the home of the greatest orators and poets.  But the modern Greeks are not much like
their fathers.-" Currants," which are really dried
seedless grapes, are the great export of Greece.
9. Italy, the middle peninsula of southern Europe, includes the islands of Sardinia and Sicily.
It is the land of the silk-worm  and the olive.
Olive-oil is used by the peasants instead of butter. The coasts yield the fish called sardines and
ancho'vies; also coral, which is torn from rocks
in the depths of the sea by divers or with dragnets.
Consult Figuier's " Ocean World," p. I40.
Io. Italy was the country of the old Romans,
who once ruled the world.  ROME is now, as it
was then, the capital; it contains the grandest of
all churches (St. Peter's), and is the residence of
the Pope. NAPLES, on a bay celebrated for its
beauty, is the commercial metropolis of Italy.
FLORENCE is famous for its picture-galleries.
VENICE, "the Queen of the Adriatic," is built
on islands; here canals take the place of streets,
and gon'dolas, long graceful boats bending up at
each end, are used instead of carriages.
I. Spain and Portugal occupy the southwestern peninsuila, a plateau traversed by mountains.
Spain has the richest quicksilver-mine in the
world, and its sheep produce the choicest wool.
The oak whose bark furnishes us with corks is
a native of the peninsula. The port wine of Portugal and the sherries of Spain are widely known.
I2. At one time these countries were among
the most enterprising on the ocean, and their sailors made many discoveries.   They still possess
76various islands and trading-posts in distant lands.
The capital of each country is also its largest city.
An earthquake once destroyed the greater part of
Lisbon and 50,000 of its inhabitants.
Southern Europe yields choice wines, olive-oil,
fruits, and silks. Constantinople is its largest city.
Italy ranks first in the production of raw silk.
Lyons, in France, is the great silk-weaving city.
THE BRITISH ISLES.
LESSON   L X V I.
i. The British Isles.-We have now made the
tour of " the Continent," or mainland of Europe.
We shall next visit England. This country, with
Scotland and Wales, forms the island of Great
Britain.  Great Britain and Ireland are called the
British Isles. Here we have them on a larger scale.

2. The United Kingdom.-The four countries
in the British Isles were once under separate governments, but they now form  " the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ".  This is one
of the great powers of the world-the greatest
in commerce and manufactures. Its ships are on
every sea.  It has possessions in every clime.  It
is sometimes called the British Empire, but its
sovereign is a king or queen. -What countries
and islands in America belong to Great Britain?
3. England teems with great cities, where thousands earn their bread in factories. LONDON, the
capital, on both sides of the Thames (temnz), is
the largest city and the greatest center of commerce in the world. It is three times as large as
New York.
LIVERPOOL is the second commercial city of
the kingdom; to this port are brought great quantities of cotton from  the United States, to be
worked up in the mills of MANCdHESTER. Woolens are made at LEEDS; machinery and firearms,
at BIRMINGHAM  (bir'ming-um); knives, razors,
and plated ware, at SHEFFIELD.  England has
great stores of iron in her mines, and plenty of
coal to use in her manufactures.
4. The soil is very carefully cultivated, but
there are so many to be supplied that grain has
to be imported.  The United States, Russia, and
other countries, contribute of their wheat, and
take English manufactures in return.
77PICTURE OF A  PIVER, A LAKE, AND A BAY.
Hills, mountains, plains, isl.
ands, peninsulas, isthmuses, and
capes, are natural divisions of
land.  Rivers, bays, gulfs, straits,
channels, and  lakes, are  natural
divisions of water.
Questions on the Engraving above.-Do you see houses
in the picture? On the border of what do they stand? Is
the water in the middle of the picture entirely surrounded by
land? What is such a body of water called? What flows
into this lake? In what part of the picture do you see a
branch of the lake indenting the land?  What is such a
branch called? Where is a waterfall represented?
Signs used on Maps.-To denote different objects on local maps, various signs
are used, which the pupil must under-  I
stand. Let him now learn them from the
accompanying map, and practice making -
them till he can reproduce them at the  |
word and give their meaning at sight.  i
Each pupil may then draw a map of
the route he takes to school, denoting his  I  
own dwelling and other objects, the roads
or streets, etc., by the proper signs as  i     BRIDGE

85. Scotland is rough, especially in the Highlands of the north. Here we find shepherds,
tending their sheep on the hills and moors. EDINBURGH  (ed'in-bur-ruh), the ancient capital, is
surpassed in size by GLASGOW, which is a busy
seat of manufactures and commerce.
6. Wales is a rugged and picturesque land,
rich in coal and iron. Many of the Welsh pass
a great part of their lives down in dark mines.
7. Ireland is called "the Emerald Isle" from
its fresh, green meadows.  Rich landlords let out
their large domains to tenants, who have as much
as they can do to get a living. Potatoes are the
main dependence. Great numbers of Irish have
emigrated to America. DUBLIN, with its fine public buildings, is a handsome city.  Next to it is
BELFAST', where the famous Irish linen is made.
8. The Smaller Islands.-Perhaps you have seen
shaggy little Shetland ponies, and wished you had
one to ride.  Find on the map the islands from
which they come. In the Shetland Islands, as
well as the Orkneys:and Hebrides (heb're-deez), cattle-raising and fishing are leading employments.
Myriads of sea - fowl -frequent the coasts of
these islands.  How do you think the people manage to get their eggs and feathers?  By letting
men down with ropes from the dizzy heights that
overhang the sea, and robbing the nests.  Sometimes the jagged rocks cut the rope, and the poor
islander is dashed to pieces.

GoODs are transported across the deserts of Africa by means of caravans. These are companies of merchants, perhaps
several hundred, who thus band together for protection. They carry various wares, which they exchange with the natives
for gums, gold-dust, ostrich-feathers, elephants' tusks, slaves, etc. The beast of burden used in these journeys is the camel.
This animal can live on the coarsest food, and go without water for a week. Scattered through the desert are o'ases, or
fertile spots, where there are springs and palm-trees. Here the caravans rest. The sketch on the left shows a caravan
arriving at an oasis. The prominent tree there shown is the date-palm. It is as useful in various ways as the palms of South
America. The dates you may have eaten, are its fruit dried.
On the right we have a diamond-mine of South Africa. The earth is broken up with picks and spades, raised to the
surface in buckets with pulleys, passed through sieves, and washed. The gravel that remains is then searched for diamonds.

LESSON  LXXI.
I. Africa has not the advantages
for commerce that Europe  and
North America have.  There are   /
few bays affording good harbors,
few rivers penetrating the interior.
The climate is hot, and in many
parts  unhealthy.  Deserts  cover
thousands of miles. As a consequence of all this, Africa is behind the other Grand Divisions in
civilization.
2. Inhabitants.-Few white men
have gone there to live. The people back from the coast are negroes,
mostly ignorant and savage. They have no schools
or newspapers, no steamboats or railroads. Their
manufactures are of the simplest sort.  The different tribes are often at war with one another,
and make slaves of the prisoners taken. Some
even feast on the flesh of their captives. Find
on the map where these fierce cannibals live. To
which grade of society (p2. 6) do they belong?
3. Surface.-Africa is mostly a plateau, bordered with a strip of low coast-plain. The principal mountains are the Atlas range, which contains various minerals, though little use is made
of them.  Mount Kilimanjaro, near the eastern
coast, south of the Equator, is the highest peak in
Africa. Its summit is white with perpetual snow.
4. Rivers.--Africa has five great rivers.  The
Nile is the longest.  Every year, owing to rains
in the upper country, the Nile overflows its banks,
and for several months its lower valley is under
water. Mud is deposited, and a strip along the
river is thus made fertile.  When the waters subside, abundant crops of wheat, barley, beans, tobacco, etc.. are raised. The ancients used to say,
"Egypt is the gift of the Nile."
Consult Prime's "Boat Life in Egypt," p. 76.
5. The other important rivers are the Nigerthe Congo, which has recently been exploredthe Zambesi, with its grand Victoria Falls rivaling Niagara-and the Orange.
ANIMAL LIFE ON AN, AFRICAN RIVER.
6. Animals.-Africa is the home of large and
fierce animals.  The elephant is hunted for its
tusks, which furnish ivory.  The majestic lion,
the spotted leopard, the long-necked giraffe, the
striped zebra, and many species of nimble antelopes, are all found in Africa.
The crocodile lurks for its prey in the rivers.
Here also sports the huge hippopotamus, or riverhorse (see engraving above).  The rhinoceros
guides its young before it through the grass, with
the long sharp horn on its nose; and the ugly
gorilla, a great ape that looks like a man, makes
the forests on the lower Congo echo with its roar.
7. Vegetable Products.-In the Mediterranean
countries, grains and tropical fruits, cotton and
indigo, are raised; in the south, wheat, potatoes,
flax, etc. The negro tribes live on the maniocroot, rice, millet, yams, the fruit of the palms,
and the products of their flocks.
8. Trees.-There are many species of palms,
without branches, but crowned with long, graceful
leaves. They yield dates, cocoanuts, sago, and
the palm-oil of Guinea.
From  the acacia-tree in Nubia and elsewhere
issues a juice which hardens into gum-arabic.
The ba'obab, or monkey-bread tree, flourishes in
Senegambia; it is remarkable for its enormous
girth, and the distance to which its lower branches
spread out, hanging to the ground. The bodies
82of executed criminals are sometimes inclosed by
the natives in the hollowed trunks of baobab-trees,
where they become dried like mummies.
9. Sahara, the Great Desert, extends from the
Atlantic nearly to the Nile. It is more than half
as large as the United States. Its only valuable
product is salt.  The heat is terrible.  Violent
sand-storms at times darken the air, and threaten
every living thing with destruction.  When such
a storm overtakes a caravan, the camels fall on
their knees, and thrust their heads to the ground
with closed nostrils; the drivers throw themselves
on their faces, and seek shelter beneath the loads.
Africa is connected with Asia by the Isthmus of
Suez. Its longest river is the Nile; its highest peak
is Mount Kilimanjaro. Egypt is its most important
country, and Cairo its largest city.
The hippopotamus, giraffe, and gorilla, are peculiar to Africa. The palm is the most useful tree.
LESSON LXXII.
I. The Barbary States.-Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, and Tripoli, lie on the Med-  _____
iterranean Sea, west of Egypt.  They         __-__
are called "the Barbary States," from
the Berbers, who were once the ruling
people.  Many of the inhabitants are
Mohammedans.   Carpets  and  rugs,
leather and the red caps worn about
the Mediterranean coasts, are made and
exported.
2. Morocco is ruled by a sultan, who
lives by turns at FEz  and MORocco,
the capitals.
You have seen the handsome leather called
morocco. It is made of goat-skins, and gets its
name from this country. Many goats are raised
in Morocco for their skins; also sheep with broad  |
fat tails weighing forty pounds or more. The
Barbary horses (whence our word barb, meaning
a horse) are fleet and spirited; it is forbidden to  The os

many Frenchmen live there.  The cap-  the bird wi

4. Tunis and Tripoli are each ruled by a bey,
who has absolute power over his subjects. The
Bey of Tripoli is appointed by the Sultan of Turkey. Barca and Fezzan pay tribute to Tripoli.
5. Egypt, centuries ago, was the seat of a
powerfLl nation, advanced in science and the
arts. The learned men of other countries went
there to study. The valley of the Nile still contains the ruins of grand temples and cities, and
pyramids built by its ancient people which are
among the wonders of the world.
6. At the present day Egypt is in name dependent on Turkey. Its sovereign has the title of
Khedive (ceh-deev').  Large tracts have been annexed on the south, and the khedive now rules as
far as the Equator.
7. Egypt is the seat of considerable commerce.
Within its limits a ship-canal has been built across
the Isthmus of Suez, making Africa really a separate continent. Vessels that used to go to the
East Indies round the Cape of Good Hope can
now pass from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea,
and save a large part of the voyage.
OSTRICH-FARM IN CAPE COLONY.
strich is the largest of birds. It inhabits the sandy plains of
om the Barbary States to Cape Colony. It is hunted for its
feathers, but is so fleet that, unless fresh horses are mounted
to time in the chase, it will escape.  The Bushman covers himan ostrich-skin, and thus manages to get near enough to shoot
ith a poisoned arrow. In Cape Colony, ostrich-raising, from tame
become a profitable employment. The eggs, each of which is
s two dozen hen's-eggs, are sometimes hatched by artificial heat.

84THE Ganges is the sacred river of the Hindoos. In old times, before they
were taught better, mothers used to throw their infants into the Ganges, and
the sick would cast themselves into its waves, deeming this the happiest of
deaths. Poppies are raised in large tracts in the valley of this river. The
opium made from their juice is largely exported to China, where the natives eat
and smoke it, to the ruin of both mind and body.
In the circle we have a pass in the Himalayas, through which a merchant
of Thibet is transporting goods on the back of the long-haired, sure-footed yak.
Below the circle is shown one of the rose-gardens of Persia, where the valuable attar of roses is made.'. Asia.-We have visited four
Grand Divisions; mention their
names in order. Leaving Africa by the Isthmus
of Suez, and crossing the Suez Canal, we now
enter a fifth Grand Division--ASIA. You have a
map of Asia on the next page.
2. Size.-Asia is the largest and most populous
of the Grand Divisions. In size it exceeds North
and South America together.
Applying the scale of miles just below parallel 40 North,
find the greatest length of Asia from east to west. Applying
the scale on meridian Ioo East, find its greatest width from
Northeast Cape to Singapore. What circle crosses northern
Asia? What tropic crosses southern Asia? What part of
Asia is coldest? What part is hottest?
3. Zones, Climate, Productions.-Asia lies in
three zones.  Refer to the map and name them.
In the far north it is icy cold. Here are dreary
marshes, frozen three-fourths of the year. Here,
also, are treeless plains, where nothing grows but
moss, stunted grass, and dwarfish shrubs.
Farther south are forests and various fur-bearing animals. Next are regions abounding in grass,
where large herds are pastured.  Then come the
grains and fruits of the temperate zones in their
order, and finally those of tropical regions.
Near the Himalay'as on the north is an extensive plateau, very high and cold; but south of
these mountains and others that spread out from
them, the country is sheltered from cold winds,
and the climate and productions are those of the
Torrid Zone. Rice is the chief dependence of the
millions who live in India and China.

VI. CLI~JV4ETE.
For the pupil to read.
In summer the weather is for the most part
hot, in winter cold. When it is neither very hot
nor very cold, we say it is mild or moderate.
Hot, cold, and moderate, denote different kinds
of Temperature. A high temperature implies
heat, a low temperature cold.
On a bright day, when the sun shines, the air
is dry.  When it rains, we say it is a wet day.
Sometimes, just before it rains, the air feels very
damp. Wet and damp denote different degrees
of Moisture in the air.
Some kinds of weather make us feel strong
and well; then we say the weather is healthy.
At other times the changes are sudden and violent; various diseases prevail. Then we call the
weather unhealthy.
The temperature, the moisture, and the healthiness, determine the character of the Climate.
The climates of different places differ. Places
that are high up on a hill or mountain are cooler
than places that are in a valley at the base of the
hill or mountain. As a general rule, places that
are farther north than we are, have a cooler climate than ours; but, for a warmer climate, we
should have to go south.
Climates may be hot or cold, damp or dry, healthy
or unhealthy. The climate of a given place is different at different seasons. The climates of different places differ in temperature, according as the
places are higher or lower, farther north or farther south.

FII. FEGEETATIOX.
For the pupil to read.
Spring is the time in which plants spring from
the ground. Plants have roots, which drink in
moisture from the soil. They have stems, through
which the sap, or juice, of the plant circulates.
They have leaves, which breathe in what is needed from  the air.  The roots, stems, and leaves,
are called organs.
A plant is an organ'ic body, and has life.  The
plants of a country constitute its Vegetation.
Plants begin to grow in spring, because then
the weather begins to be warm. There are regions
so cold that few if any plants will grow in them.
In order that plants may grow, their roots or
leaves must supply them with moisture. Where
no rain falls, there are generally deserts.
Besides warmth and moisture, a good soil helps
the growth of plants. The farmer knows this. He
puts fertilizers on his fields, to make the soil rich.
Some plants do not shed their leaves in winter. They are ever green, and so we call them
evergreens.  The pine is an evergreen.  Other
trees lose all their leaves; they are called de-cid'u-ous. The oak is a deciduous tree.
Some plants come up of themselves, and bear
blossoms and fruit though no one takes care of
them; these are wild plants. Others come up
from  seed, that is planted, and are tended with
care, kept free from weeds, etc. Such plants are
said to be cultivated.
Plants are useful in various ways. Some, such
as pines and other trees, yield wood for building
and for fuel. Others, as cotton and flax, furnish
materials for clothing.   Others supply us with
drinks, as tea and coffee; others, again, with food,
as potatoes.

9DESCRIPTIVE  MATTER..
LESSON LXXVII.
i. Outline.-If you look at
the map of Asia, you will notice how many seas, gulfs, and
bays, indent the coast.  There
are five large peninsulas, all
pointing south.  Name them.
2. Surfac e.-The highest
plains and the highest mountains belong to Asia.  All CenZ
tral Asia consists of plateaus
crossed by massive mountain-   v   
ranges.  The plateau of Thibet is the most elevated inhabited land in the world.  From       ELEPHANT AT BA
it rise the Himalayas- the
abode of snow, as their name signifies.  To this
range belongs Mount Everest, the loftiest summit known, nearly five and a half miles in height.
There are no fire-mountains among the Himalayas,
and few minerals of value.
The Altai Mountains are rich in minerals.
North of them is a vast plain, sloping toward the
Arctic Ocean.
3. Deserts cover a large part of Asia.  The
barren plains of Arabia are among the hottest
regions in the world.  On the sands of Gobi, an
immense desert of the Chinese Empire, rain seldom if ever falls.
4. M[inerals.--The Ural, as well as the Altai
Mountains, are full of mineral treasures.  Gold is
distributed through both.  Other products of the
Ural range are diamonds, emeralds, iron, and
plat'inum, a metal that was once coined as money
by the Russians.  Coal-fields occur in China, India, and Japan.
5. The Persian Gulf and Ceylon (se'lon) are
noted for their pearls.  Where do you think
pearls are found? In oysters, which divers go
down into the waters and gather from the rocks.
The finest diamonds have been found in Hindostan.  A very large one, which formed the eye of
an idol in a Hindoo temple, was sold to a Russian
empress for more than $450,000.
6. Wild animals and
poisonous serpents are numerous in Asia.  Among them is one formidable
beast found nowhere else-the tiger.  The jungles of India (plains covered with reeds, tall grass,
or thickets) are the tiger's favorite home.  Here,
while lying in wait for deer and other inhabitants
of the jungle, he sometimes meets the elephant,
whom  he does not shrink from  encountering.
The lion, the camel, and the Indian rhinoceros,
are among the larger animals of Asia.
7. Asiatic Russia. We found that Russia covers more than half of Europe.  Crossing the
Ural Mountains and River, this great empire embraces also more than a third of Asia.  But parts
of its dominions are very cold and not worth
much.  The greater portion of Asiatic Russia is
called Siberia.
8. Around the Sea of Aral lies Russian Turkestan.  Here are extensive steppes-treeless plains
covered with grass-where wandering people of
the Tartar race find pasturage for their horses
and camels, sheep and goats.  Georgia, separated
from Europe by the Caucasus Mountains, is also
a part of the Russian Empire.  Its men are noted
for their fine forms, its women for their beauty.
9. Siberia is mostly cold and cheerless.  Every
year Russia banishes several thousand offenders to
88its wilds; sometimes even drunkards and vagrants
are thus punished. Formerly these exiles endured
severe hardships, but now they live more comfortably.  Of late years the country has improved.
Roads have been made and schools established.
An active trade is carried on with China.
Io. Siberia is important for its minerals and
excellent furs.  Mining has proved very profitable
on the Ural slopes.  Furnaces, iron-works, and
factories, have been established near the mines.
Towns have sprung up in their neighborhood,
and handsome palaces have been erected there by
the rich nobles that own the mining-lands.
I. The uncivilized natives living in the north
and east are nearly as numerous as the Russians.
They sell the Russian traders furs and walrustusks.  Some of them  have large herds of tame
reindeer, which they drive from place to place for
pasturage.  Others kill great numbers of wild
reindeer while swimming the rivers on their way
to the south.  Fish and the fowl that swarm in
the northern waters help to support these natives.
Asia is the largest of the Grand Divisions, and
contains the most inhabitants. The Yang-tse-kiang
is its longest river. The Himalayas are its loftiest
mountain-ehain. chain   Mount Everest is the highest peak
in the world, and Thibet forms the most elevated
plateau. DMore than one-third of Asia belongs to the
Russian Empire.
WRITTEN EXERCISEE.- -omplee thke following: From Europe
we can enter Asia by crossing --; from Africa, by crossing -; from North America, by crossing -. If we sailed
along the entire eastern coast of Asia, starting from East
Cape, we should traverse in order the following waters:
Coasting southern Asia, we should pass through
ON THE STEPPES-TARTAR CAMP.
LESSON LXXVIII.
I. Turkey, like Russia, has extensive dominions
in Asia.  Asiatic Turkey forms the larger part of
the Ottoman Empire.  It lies on the Black, the
Mediterranean, and the Red Sea.   CONSTANTINOPLE is the capital of the whole.
2. The chief seaport of Asiatic Turkey is
SMYRNA, from  which we get figs and opium.
The most noted city is JERUSALEFM.  Here our
Saviour was buried, and in the Middle Ages immense armies went from  Europe, to capture the
city and rescue his tomb from the Mobammedans.
The Turks cross their legs under them on mats or cushions; they do not use chairs. They spend much time in the
bath, and in smoking the long-tubed apparatus which serves
them for a pipe. It is a rule of their religion that they wash
their hands before and after every meal; and they have need
to do so, for they help themselves by dipping their fingers in
the dishes.  The women are treated as slaves rather than
equals, being kept shut up in rooms by themselves.  The
men wear turbans, and the women are never seen in public
without veils that hide their faces.
3. Arabia is a large peninsula in southwestern
Asia, of which the Turks hold the coast on the
Red Sea.  It is divided among different states
and tribes.  Most of the Arabs have settled abodes,
and cultivate the soil in a rude way, millet being
their chief grain.  But there are some that wander about through  the interior, driving  their
flocks where they can find pasturage, and robbing caravans that journey through the deserts.
The natives call the wastes in southeastern Arabia "tle abode of emptiness ".
4. In connection with Arabia we must remember the fleet Arabian horses-gum-arabic, produced by its acacia-trees-and the excellent Mocha
coffee.  MECCA is a city of note. It was the birthplace of Mohammed; his followers regard it as a
holy city, and make pilgrimages thither in thousands every year.
5. Persia, Afghanistan, and  Beloochistan, all
Mohammedan countries, lie on a plateau bordered
with mountains.  The interior is barren, except
where water is carried through it from  streams.
Much of Persia is a salt desert; it seems strange
that it should once have been the most powerful country in the world.

I6. Carpets and shawls, drugs and the gems
called turquoises (tur-lcoiz'es), are obtained from
Persia. The mulberry-tree flourishes, and silk is
a leading production.  The Shah, or king, has
power of life and death over his subjects.
7. Afghanistan commands the gates to India.
The Afghans are a brave people, who look down
on trade. They are under an Ameer', or king,
who lives at CABUL, the capital.
8. Beloochistan is divided among different
tribes, principally wandering herdsmen. They
are ruled by Khans, or chiefs, of whom the Khan
of Kelat (k/el-aht'), the capital, is the head.
9. India.-Crossing the mountains on the east
of Afghanistan (see map), we enter India.  Here
is Hindostan'-the land of the Hindoos-which
reaches from the Indian Ocean to the Himalayas.
This peninsula and the one east of it, with the
islands near by, are often called the East Indies.
Smyrna is the chief seaport of western Asia. Jerusalem was the capital of the Jews, when they were
a great nation. Mecca, in Arabia, is the holy city of
the lohammedans.
LESSON LXXIX.
I. Hindostan, Ceylon, and a strip on the east
side of the Bay of Bengal (ben-gawl'), belong to
the British Empire. The British began to trade
here many years ago, and gradually gained control
of nearly the whole country.
2. The Hindoos are browncomplexioned and slender. They,
are divided into four castes, or
classes. The men and women of
one caste are forbidden to marry those of another, or even eat
with them.  The highest caste
includes priests, who are very
learned and versed in ancient!
books on which their laws and
religion are based. The common
people are mostly Pagans; they
do not believe in the true God,
but worship idols. When a man
dies, they think his soul passes     CaINESE BOATinto some lower animal. Cows they hold sacred,
and will not kill for food.
3. The Hindoos are very skillful in making
fine muslins, and in weaving costly shawls from
the hair of the Cashmere goat.
4. There are four times as many inhabitants in
India as in the whole of North America.  The
land is very fertile, and produces rice abundantly
--also, opium, indigo, gums, etc. The banyan, or
Indian fig-tree, is a great curiosity. Its branches
send out shoots to the earth, which take root, so
that one tree sometimes has two or three thousand
trunks and covers ten acres.
5. Cities.-CALCUTTA is the capital and metropolis of British India.  BOMBAY and MADRAS,
connected with Calcutta by railroad, are large
seaports. Many English people reside in these
cities.
6. China.-From  India we pass into China.
This country contains more people than all Europe, North and South America, together. They
are so crowded that many live on boats in the
rivers. Thousands of jun/cs, as the Chinese boats
are called, will sometimes be found moored together near a large city, where the fishing is
good.
7. Where so many millions live, it is necessary
to make the most of the land; so in China the
soil is very carefully cultivated. Canals are dug,
to carry water through the fields. Rice, tea, and
silk, are the staples.
VILLAGE.
Huge birds called cormorants, trained to dive
and catch fish for their owners, are often kept
on the river-junks. A ring is passed round the
neck of the bird, to prevent him from swallowing his prey.
9o8. The natives eat rice with chopsticks, which
serve them instead of forks and spoons. Everybody drinks tea, and thousands are engaged in
raising the shrub, gathering the leaves, rolling
them up, drying them over fires, coloring and
perfuming them. Silk and satin are used by the
nobles for their robes. The poor content themselves with garments of cotton, which is raised to
some extent. China-ware first caine from China.
9. The Chinese, when they
would dress in
mourning, put
on white. Yellow is worn only
by high officials.
The fashionable lady hobbles along  on
little deformed
feet, which were
prevented from
growing by being kept tightly
banedaged  when
she was an infant.  Formerly this people                           JAPANESE S'
would have no
dealings with the rest of the world. But now
they trade with foreigners, and so many of them
have come to America that you have probably
seen a Chinaman, with his yellowish-brown face,
oblique eyes, shaved head; and long pig-tail.
io. Cities.-Great crowded cities are numerous
in China.  PEKIN', which contains more people
than New York, is the capital.  SHANGHIAI carries on the largest commerce with foreign nations.
i i. The Chinese Empire contains other countries besides China Proper.  The northern districts are adapted to pasturage, and large flocks
are kept there. Corea has a king of its own, who
pays tribute to the Eniperor of China.  Thibet is
mostly barren. Fine goat's-hair shawls are made
there.
The Chinese Empire embraces nearly one-fourth
of Asia. Rice, tea, and silk, are its staples.  
LESSON LXXX.
x. Japan is anothler wonderful empire of Asia,
embracing several large, and many small, islands
on the eastern coast.
The engraving represents a scene in one of the cities of
this island-empire.  The imperial mail-carrier is running
through. Every one has to make way for him-the boy with
his kite, the mounted merchant and his attendant, the passersby of either sex.
In the background
is a clumsy loaded cart, drawn by
men. The horses
are small, and are
kept for riding. In
the foreground, on
the right is a fisherman in his costume
of straw; fish are
much used for food,
and are often eaten
raw.  On the left
is an armed official.  The  ladies
are dressed in gay
embroidered silks.
2. The Japanese are intelligent and inREET SCENE.                       genious.  Once,
like  the  Chinese, they shut themselves up from  the world,
and were behind the age.  But lately they have
opened ports to foreign trade, and introduced the
improvements of other nations--steamboats, railroads, telegraphs, machinery, etc.
3. The Japanese are expert in farming and
gardening. They have the curious art of dwarfing trees to the height of a few feet or even
inches, and can trim their plants to the exact
shape of any bird or beast. There are volcanoes
on the islands, and earthquakes are numerous;
the latter the natives think are caused by the
struggles of a huge fish in the ocean beneath them.
4. Exports.-You  have seen jqapanned ware;
it is one of the exports of Japan. In making
it, the juice of the valuable varnish-tree is used.
Japanese vases, bronzes, and wood-carvings, are
much  admired.   Many of the  inhabitants are
TI
9'1employed in producing silk and raising tea; these
articles are the chief exports.
5. Cities.-To'KIO, the capital, is larger than
Brooklyn or Chicago. It is a manufacturing city,
as is also KIOTO (ke-o'to), the ancient capital.
6. Indo-China, the most easterly of the three
southern peninsulas, embraces the kingdoms of
Burmah, Siam, and Anam. Here we have the
hot climate, tropical productions, thick jungles,
and fierce beasts, of India. Most'of the trade is
carried on by Chinese residents. Siam is noted
for its elephants; there are several thousand in
the royal army. White elephants, which are sometimes captured, are set apart for the king; a
white elephant is on the royal seal and flag.
7. Bamboo.-In Indo-China, as in China, the
bamboo is one of the most useful plants. The
young shoots are boiled as vegetables or made into
sweetmeats; the joints are put together for waterpipes; the pith is used for lamp-wick, the wood
for almost every purpose you can think of. Whole
cities are made up of bamboo houses, the wood being merely lashed together, so that the pieces can
be taken apart and put up elsewhere.
8. Getting back.-Look at the map of Asia, p. 86. What
Grand Division just appears in the northeast corner? When
we left North America, we sailed east across the Atlantic. We
traveled east across Europe, till we came to Asia. We kept
on east across Asia; and now, still keeping to the east, we
cross Behring Strait, and get back to North America. We
can, then, by keeping the samie direction, go round the earth,
and return to the place from which we started. What does
this prove with respect to the shape of the earth (seep. I7)?
Illustrate with the globe.
Mfost of the Asiatics are Pagans or Mohammedans.
China and India are the most populous countries of
Asia; together they contain nearly half the people
in the world.
The largest city of Asia is Pekin, the capital of
China.
The earth is round.
WRITTEN EXERCISE.-Complete the following: Three countries of Europe have large possessions in Asia; viz., -.
I, C -, and J-, are the most important countries of
Asia. Vessels from Europe bound for the East Indies used
to go round the Cape of -; now they can shorten the voyage by passing through the -   Canal, which connects -.

LESSON LXXXII.
We have now traversed five Grand Divisions of
the earth; name them. A sixth still remains.
It is made up of isles of the ocean, and is therefore called Oceania (o-she-ah'ne-a). See map on

LESSON  LXXXIII.
I. Australia.-The largest island of Oceania--
so large that it-is often called  a continent  is
Australia.  It does not look very large on the
map, because the map is on a small scale; but it
is more than three-fourths the size of Europe or
the United States.
Applying the scale to the map, find the greatest length of
the island-continent from east to west.  Find its greatest
width from north to south. Copy the outline of Australia
from the map. Locate the Murrav and the Darling River,
Central Mount Stuart, and the five capitals.
2. Inhabitants.--Australia is a part of the great
British Empire, which we have found  holding
possessions in each of the Grand Divisions. At
one time criminals were transported from England to Australia; but the country proved so
good for sheep-raising  that convicts were sent
elsewhere, and English farmers and stock-raisers
went out to settle there. Then rich gold deposits
were discovered in the southeastern part; and
soon large cities grew  up, railroads and  telegraphs were built, and the Australian colonies
became important centers of commerce.
3. The Australian Natives, now  few  in number, are black, degraded, and repulsive. Their
dress consists of skins fastened with skewers, and
they live in shelters of bark or boughs.  They
devour raw flesh, lizards, and worms.
4. Climate, Soil, etc.-Australia is very hot;
large rivers are few.  Some parts of the interior
are sandy deserts; others are covered with grass
as high as a man on horseback.
5. Both the plants and the animals are peculiar.
The kangaroo, which with its long tail and powerful hind-legs can take enormous leaps (p. 99),
is hunted for its flesh and skin. The dingo, or
wolfish wild dog, destroys great numbers of sheep.
The black swan, and the emu with a long neck
like the ostrich, are the most remarkable birds.
6. Exports.-Gold and wool are the chief exports of Australia. The engraving above shows
miners at work, washing away the banks with
water, and gathering the heavy particles of gold,
which sink while the lighter earthy matter is carried off. The sketch on the right shows the process of sheep-shearing.-Other exports are coal,
copper, wheat, tallow, and hides.
7. MELBOURNE, the capital of one of the colonies, is the largest city and busiest seaport.
8. Coral Formations.-Along the northeastern
coast of Australia runs the Barrier Reef, over
which for a thousand miles the waves break with
the noise of thunder. This reef is of coral. What
do you suppose made it? _Myriads of tiny animals, which separate limy matter from the ocean,
and build up great walls from deep ledges with their
skeletons. Coral is of different forms and colors.
94Many islands in the warmer seas, and particularly in the
Indian Ocean and the Pacific, are coral formations. The animals can not live above the surface of the sea. But the top
layers of their structure are ground to powder by the waves,
and washed up toward the center. Next, sand and sea-weed
are deposited.  Birds bring seeds there, which spring up.
Year after year the soil is increased and enriched by decaying
leaves; and at last a fruitful island is formed for the residence
of man.-Consult Le Conte's " Elements of Geology," p. I38.
9. The Island World.-On the map of Oceania
are many islands besides Australia. In general
they have a warm  climate, a fertile soil, and a
rich vegetation.   Their dark-brown natives are
mostly uncivilized and worshipers of idols. Some
of them  are gentle and intelligent, while others
are constantly engaged in war.  Both men and
women are skillful swimmers and divers, and will
sport for hours in the surf.
European nations have taken possession of some
of these islands, or parts of them.  Many have
sought them  as permanent settlers, and others in
order to trade in their rich products.
i o. The Bread-fruit is the chief dependence of
the natives.  It is larger than a cocoanut, and
when baked yields a nutritious pulp that is like
bread made with eggs. The trees keep blossoming,
and the fruit continues ripening, most of the year.
One person can live on the produce of three trees.
ISLANDERS OF THE PACIFIC.-BREAD-FRUIT TREE.
Australia, the largest island or smallest continent in the world, belongs to the British Empire.
Gold and wool are the staples. The Murray, its chief
river, is a thousand miles long. Melbourne is its
largest city.
LESSON LXXXIV.
Other Islands.- We must learn something about
the other important islands of Oceania.
SUMATRA, most of which is subject to Holland, exports pepper, coffee, camphor, etc.
JAVA, larger than the state of New York, and
governed by the Dutch, produces the best coffee.
BORNEO, as large as Great Britain and France
together, is rich in spices and tropical forests.
THE SPICE ISLANDS, mostly under the Dutch,
yield spices-cloves, nutmegs, pepper, etc.
THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS belong to the Spanish, who named them after their king Philip II.
NEW  GUINEA is occupied mainly by savage
tribes. The Dutch have settlements on the coast.
NEW ZEALANTD is a British colony. Like Australia, it yields gold and wool.
THE SANDWICH  ISLANDS form  a prosperous
independent kingdom. The people have become
civilized, and give great attention to their schools.
WRITTEN EXERCISE.--Complete the following:
There are -   Grand Divisions of the earth;
viz., --. Oceania consists of -   lying mostly
in the    Ocean. Several European countries
have possessions in Oceania. Great Britain has, and Tasma'nia. Holland has --, the
-  Islands, and part of --. Spain has -.
We reached Asia by traveling --  from North
America. Crossing the Pacific from Asia in an
easterly direction, we get back to --. We thus
find that the earth is
The Hemispheres.--We have found
that the earth is round.  A body round?i   like a ball is called a Sphere.  Half a
sphere is called a Hemisphere.
Now suppose the earth cut into two
hemispheres from north to south.  The
round surface of each may be represented as flat, and thus we get maps of
the WESTERN and the EASTERN HEMISPHERE (see pages 96, 97).  Taken together, they make a map of the World.
