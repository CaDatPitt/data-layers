The ﬂattering success of McGuﬁ'ey’s Revised Readers,

' and the inquiry for more primary reading matter to be

used in the ﬁrst year of school Work, have induced the
Publishers to prepare a REVISED PRIMER, which may be
used to precede the First Reader of any Well arranged

_ series.

The method pursued is the same as that in McGufi'ey’s Re-
vised Readers, and the greatest possible care has been taken
to insure a gradation suited to the youngest children. Only
about six new Words are to be mastered in each lesson.
These new Words and the new elementary sounds are always
to be found in the Vocabulary of the lesson in which they
are ﬁrst used. T

The plan of the book enables the teacher to pursue the
Phonic Method, the Word Method, the Alphabet Method,
or any combination of these methods.

Illustrations of the best character have been freely sup-
plied, and the skilled teacher will be able to use them to
great advantage. ‘ I _

The script exercises throughout the book and the slate
exercises at the close, have been specially Written and care-
fully engraved for this Primer; they may be used to teach
the reading of script, and as exercises in learning to Write.

In the full conﬁdence that the public will appreciate a
cheap and attractive Primer of this character, the Publishers
have spared no expense to make this book equal, in type,
paper, and illustrations, to any that have been issued from

their Press.
