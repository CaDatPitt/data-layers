overTurned dining room Tables. One fellow was "resTless". According To The LPN,
This mighT have been due To a TooThache. The Third residenf hlT an aTTendanT aT

There was one sTaff member for 43 residenTs. The residenTs were enThusiasTic To
see visiTors. They shared Their picTures; radios and mail wiTh The Team. The

Again The aTTendanTs seemed To be doing Their work well. Few residenTs were aT
programs off The uniT.

The visiTaTion Team was disTressed abouT This uniT. BuT The Team could noT define
The reasons for This feeling. Possible reasons included: The adulT age of some
