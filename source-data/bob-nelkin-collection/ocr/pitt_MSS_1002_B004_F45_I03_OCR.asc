PARC President

RE: Polk State School 8 Hospital

Reports surrounding Polk State School and Hospital indicate
the situation to have been very hectic in the last few days. It is
important we report to chapters the positions taken by the Pennsylvania

‘Association,for Retarded Children.

As you know dating back as far as i967 careful reviews were
made of our state schools and hospitals including Polk. At that time,
a great deal of concern was expressed about the overcrowding and lack
of appropriate programmatic services. You will recall, at our i969
convention in Pittsburgh, the response of the convention body was to take
action for change in the institutions as a result of this study. The
Right to Education suit was a result of this focus, with the feeling of
our legal counsel that class action in this area would affect the largest
number of the mentally retarded. Q ‘

The Allegheny County Chapter had made several visits to Polk
State School and Hospital in i972 and expressed great concern about; ‘
overcrewding'and lack of programs. '

On February 27, 1973, Mrs. Eleanor Elkin, Chairman, PARC
Residential Services Committee; Mrs. Isherwood, PARC Secretary and
Sub~committee Chairman on interim Care; Richard ﬁazelon, Attorney; and_
our Executive Director and myself visited Polk to better acquaint our-'

1 selves with the institution and what services were being provided.

we were disturbed by what we found at that visit. we were
disturbed»by:

l. The continued overcrowding of wards in which
we found lOO beds stacked side by side;

2. Locations where cribs were pushed against each
other leaving little access to the severely
retarded in these cribs.

3. Use of restraints, such as straitjackets.
4. Residents, both young and old, tied to benches.

5. The use of enclosures which we could only characterize
as cages. These were found in use at several locations.

. These conditions, along with our earlier reports, heightened our
distress and prompted us to call for further action. ‘

in our discussion with the superintendent his attitude, which i
am sure was sincere, was that very little could be done. He seemed quite
satisfied that his residents were happy and content. Consequently, we called
upon the Secretary of Public welfare and the Governor's Office requesting
that an immediate visit to the institution be made. We asked them to observe
the dehumanizing aspects of these cages, to disassemble them and to implement
appropriate programs.

The Secretary of Public welfare visited Polk on April lh unannounced.
Accompanying the Secretary was Deputy Secretary Norman Taylor. The Secretary
also invited me to attend.

The Secretary was distressed with the cages found and ordered
them immediately dismantled. Subsequently, it was reported to us that the
Secretary, in,discussion with the Governor, decided to terminate Dr. McClelland
as Superintendent. it was reported that she offered Dr. McClelland the oppor-
tunity to retire, but he refused. .His employment was terminated on April lb.

The Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children did not call
for the removal or termination of Dr. McClelland but did call for action to
be taken with respect to the conditions we found. ‘After the Secretary's A
action, PARC supported the Secretary and Governor for taking this courageous
step with the indicated intention of following through with programmatic
changes at Polk. c Q '

it is our understanding that the Secretary's removal of Dr.
McClellandfrom his position was because he did not see a need for any
different approach. ’

The purpose and goal of the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded
Children is to see that appropriate programs and services are provided for
the mentally retarded.. This includes programs within institutions, programs
which enable people to move back to the community and programs for mentally
retarded persons now in the community. This objective and purpose must be
kept in the forefront. We cannot become involved with any efforts to carry
out vendettas against individuals or personalities.

. I implore all members and chapters to work as advocates for the
mentally retarded. Our concern is with the mentally retarded, not politics.
