Mr. Robert Hiltner, superintendent
Western State School and Hospital
333 Curry Hill Road

Canonsburg, PA 15013

Dear sob,

This is to further our conversation of Thursday, March 1, 1973.
I received a copy of your March 7 letter to chuck where you
state your understanding of our meeting. This response will
state both agreement and disagreement with your letter.

I have discussed the items of this meeting with members of
ACC-PARC's State School and Hospital and Interim Care Committee.
On the subject of written authorization by parents for ACC-PARC
visits, we are in agreement. Such a procedure will be cumber-
some, but we feel it is an appropriate protection for both
ACC-PARC and Western State School and Hospital (W853). This
procedure will be followed henceforth.

on the second item, surprise visits by Acc-PARC, we do not fully
concur. our Committee feels that this is a vital tool in our
program of advocacy. we will. therefore. with written permis-
sion by parents, continue to visit specific residents without
prior notification to Western State. .

This is not to suggest that every visit will be unannounced.
Unannounced visits will occur when, in our judgment, staff
preparation would hinder the purpose of our visit. In these
cases, ACC-PARC will contact you or your deputy upon both arrival
and departure. «

on your third point, we are pleased to be orking cooperatively
with the Board of Trustees and Parents’ Group on the joint '
visitation. Incidentally. last night the ACC~PARc Board approved
the joint visitation team as an on-going activity of our Com-
mittee. However, it is not practical to organize joint, unan~
nounced visitation to individual residents. We are, however.

Mr. Robert Biltner
March 23, 1973

willing to explore procedures that might involve all three.
groups in visits to individuals. ‘ 4

We would emphasize that our role on these unannounced visits
has been only to observe and fact-find for individual parents.
Bob aelkin is a responsible start member of this Association.

It you have any complaints or suggestions about his visits to _

Western State, we would be glad to meat with you again and
discuss than. ." - ' -

Again, we are extremely pleased that the W883 Parents‘ Group,
the wssa Board of Trustees, and Ace-PABC are working coopera-
tively with you. we look forward to continuous joint efforts.

Sincerely.

Virginia Thornburgh, Chairman
State schools and Hospitals and
Interim Care Committee
