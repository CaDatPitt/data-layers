RELEASE or INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEATH or PAUL JENKINS.

Having made an inquiry into the death of Paul Jenkins which occurred November 13,
1974- at the Western State School and Hospital, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania at appro-
ximately 8:30 P. M. , I find that the cause of death was aspiration due to food particles
lodged in the larynx. ' ~ I - ’

jFrom the testimony received at the State Hospital on November 14, 1974 by the
administration and employees, the following opinions and recommendations are
«arrived at from this testimony by~the_ Coroner of Washington County, Farrell
Jackson: _ p _ »

. 1. Lack of sufficient personnel to render the proper service and
care due to the patients confined in the Western State School and Hospital. This
is based on the testimony that only three attendants were involved with 37 patients;
two were trained and one had only been employed for one month without training.
The structure of these 37 patients required some to be fed personally by the atten-
dants, some who fed themselves, and all required strict "attention as to what they
were doing at the time of _eatin<r. This, in the opinion of the Coroner, is an impos-
sible feat for the three employees to do and provide the care and full protection
that each patient needed. ‘ _ _ _
' 2. The administrator, Mr. Hiltnerptestified to the rules of the
‘institution in respect to feeding. ' The rule is that patients who are hand feet should
have an attendant there while theyare consuming their meal. When the question
"was asked, did the attendant do this in this particular case, they replied in the ne-
gative because of the other 36 patients they were attending and, therefore, could
not carry out the rule in full enforcement. Opinion of- the Coroner is that this rule
is only feasable to be carried out if there is enough employees employed to have
the time to do so. ‘ '

3. Dietary procedure is lacking in a complete ‘check before serving

tothe patients that the assignc_d food is _for_thc patient that is receiving it and it
complies completely with the request of the doctoi; or the physician, who has re~

- quested it. It is th,e~'*opinion of the Coroner that this procedure should be looked
' ' into immediately, that all trays should be marked with names and numbers of

patients and any special feeding procedure that is ordered by the doctor for the
patient should be known in full by the supervisor of the dietary department and ’
any special requests should be passed on to those who are serving the patients
so no mistake. is made. ’ ' ‘ I

RECOMMENDATIONS to the Western State School and Hospital’:

1. That immediately, action be taken to hire and provide properly
trained employees to give the service and care and protection that is needed at all
times with this type of patient.’ ' ' A -

2. The dietary department be implemented in providing the infor‘-
mation needed for each patient’s meal to the employee as ordered by the physician.
OPINION: It is the opinion of the Coroner of Washington County, Farrell Jackson,
that the testimony of thisinvestigation finds no criminal neglect on the part of em-
ployees or the administration, but certainly, -without question, finds, as I stated
previously, the lack of personnel to carry out the rules and the care and protection

S ‘g of these‘ patients is the contributing part directly to this death. ' Unfortunately,
-this isnot the only death that has occurred due to the above reasons.

. I .

IniJuly 20, 1974 Mark Leonard, age 13, came to his death by
drowning in an unfenced reservoir due to, again, not enough personnel to pay full

. "attention to all they were assigned to them and this young man was able to stray

away and fall into the reservoir. .‘

These two tragic deaths, under similar circumstances of not enough

V personnel, leaves this office with the responsibility of reporting these incidents to

the State Government, namely Governor Shapp, to send an investigating team to the
Western State School and Hospital for the purpose of investigating these charges
and providing the personnel that is needed as quickly as possible.
