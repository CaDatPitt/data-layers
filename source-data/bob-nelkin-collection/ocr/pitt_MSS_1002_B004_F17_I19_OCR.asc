The Honorable Helene Wohlgemuth
Secretary of Public Welfare

333 Health & Welfare Building
Harrisburg, PA 17120

Dear Secretary Wohlgemuth:

The Harrisburg Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has often
been critical of the Department of Public Welfare on matters of the rights of
patients within mental institutions and we have not hesitated to critize the
absence of action we considered necessary. Often, I fear, we have failed to
commend officials who have taken action to insure the constitutional rights
and the human dignity of patients.

‘Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to commend you for ordering
the dismantling of dehumanizing cages which have been used routinely in con-
trolling the mentally retarded.

News reports that the Department--whatever that term refers to--was

aware of the presence of these cages seems to me quite hollow. I am impressed
by the fact that once you as a responsible official saw these for yourself that
you spontaneously and immediately ordered their dismantling and moved to change
the personnel who had not only tolerated but exploited the presence of these
uncivilized devices.

Our Chapter's Patients Rights Task Force continues to have serious ob-
jections to Harrisburg State Hospital's policies that abridge the freedom of
patients, and we will be in touch with you about these matters over the coming
weeks, but your action with respect to Polk State School gives heart to all of
us working to insure a dignified existence for patients confined to state hospitals.

(/wsineerely,

Robert B. Dennis
Chapter President
