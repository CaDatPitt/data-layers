SON DISMISSED FROM INSTITUTION BECAUSE OF PARENT

A young man was dismissed from a state-licensed and funded residential facility
because his parent persistently questioned the care and training the son received
from the institution. The dismissal of the young man to his parent's home followed
subtle threats and intimidation from the facility's administrators that, "If you
don't like the program, take your son out".

Getting rid of children of parents who are "trouble-makers" may be one of the
cruelest actions that can be taken by an institution. Yet none of us stopped this
cruelty. Not the other parents, the local MH/MR Center, the County MH/MR office,
the Department of Public Welfare, or this Association.

Until we do stop intimidation and the getting rid of children of questioning
parents, the question will remain, "Who is next to go?"

INSTITUTIONS: MANY CHANGES AND NO CHANGE

Admissions to Western State School and Hospital are closed. Polk has decreased
from 2,750 to 1,950 residents in just two years.

The Superintendents of Polk and Western were fired. Numerous evaluations and
consultant reports have been filed. Both facilities are trying to develop good
training programs.

In other words, many changes for the better have occurred.

HOWEVER .. we recently visited Polk and western for one day each and found no
change in one of the most important areas: tender-loving-care. In two whole days
of visits, we saw only a few of hundreds of the staff we observed giving personal
attention to the residents.

why couldn't the staff have talked to the boys and girls when they were feeding
them? Couldn't someone have pushed a boy on the swing instead of watching him like
prison guards do? Where were the reassuring words and physical touching? Couldn't
the staff have tried to stimulate activity and help the residents grow and learn?

we think all of this should be happening since the working conditions are im-
proving. We praise those workers who care about the residents and give them at-
tention and tender-loving-care. We challenge the workers who don't. A lot more
needs to be done!

PARENTS IN OTHER STATES RECEIVE SUBSIDY PAYMENTS

New York and Minnesota are beginning subsidies to families to assist them in
maintaining their retarded child at home.

The experimental program in Minnesota grants monthly subsidies of up to $250.00
per child. The child must be (1) under 18 years of age and (2) eligible for place-
ment in an institution. The program in New York is similar to the Minnesota pro-
gram. It was ordered by a Federal Court Judge to help improve conditions at Willow-
brook State Institution.

A radical idea? Well, why not? Family care is less expensive to the taxpayer
than institutional care would be. And the children receive the love and attention
missing in most institutions. Anyone want to start the ball rolling in Pennsyl-
Vania?

EAST AREA PARENTS ORGANIZE .. MORE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR ADULTS

Eighty parents in the eastern suburbs organized in May and June to get another
sheltered workshop started. They are doing this because their adult sons/daughters
are sitting (or will be sitting after graduation) at home without anything to do.

The parents met with the Allegheny County Mental Retardation Administrator,
Chuck Peters, to request that a sheltered workshop be started in the Penn Hills
area. Peters praised the parents "for looking ahead better than the professionals
do." But Peters was unable to make a firm commitment to the parents because of un-
certainty about funds from the state.

The parents then met with Senator Majority Leader Tom Nolan and State Representa-
tive Ron Cowell. Both legislators promised to meet with the County Commissioners
to help get the sheltered workshop started.

PARENTS TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT OF OVERCHARGE BY INSTITUTION

In January we discovered that the State of Pennsylvania was discarding legisla-
tion which PARC sponsored. Senate Bill #53, when passed by the legislature and
signed into law by the Governor, meant parents would no longer be required to pay
for their son's/daughter's MH/MR services once they reached 18 years of age. But,
the Department of Public Welfare ignored the law and charged some parents for
their son's or daughter's room and board in an institution.

Through the help of our state association and Attorney Dane Ferleger from Phila-
delphia, the Justice Department informed the Department of Public Welfare that they
(DPW) were breaking the law. DPW has finally agreed to pay back the parents who
were illegally charged.

A parent from a local institution brought DPW's illegal action to our attention.
We all are grateful to him.

PARENTSâ€™ R.I.P. CORPORATION DEVELOPED

Over the last months, some parents met to organize a non-profit corporation to
act in their place, as surrogate parents, when they die. One of the parents said,
"What I want from this corporation is to be able to Rest in Peace". Thus, the name.

The need for this corporation (R.I.P. Corp.) was stated by parents in various
ways. (1) Other parents can best care for their son/daughter due to empathy;
(2) the future of their sons and daughters should not be left to government due
to lack of sensitivity; (3) siblings should not be burdened with the responsibility
of the dependent person's care; (4) bank trust officers will gladly be relieved of
tough decisions about the dependent person (banks will still make investment deci-
sions).

Some ideas for how R.I.P. Corp. will work are: (1) corporation will advise bank
on the use of funds and the care of the person; (2) corporation will be the indiv-
idual's advocate; (3) corporation's money will supplement care provided by govern-
ment agencies; (4) family's home will be willed to the corporation to be the resi-
dence of the son/daughter and others.

Many other ideas are being considered. We'll keep you informed of R.I.P. Corp.'s
development.
