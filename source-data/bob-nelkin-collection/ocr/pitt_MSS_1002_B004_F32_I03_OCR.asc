‘POLK; i..P§i.i:—— Its ;an overcrowded.
understaffed ward, so the women sit -
some naked, some in straitjackets — on
wooden benches and do nothing. The
stench of urine fills the air.

20-year worker who was obviously bitter

‘ about Dr. McClelland’s dismissal. 

He begins to give his list of the hospi-

tal’s troubles under the new administra-
' tion, but stops and says he prefers to see

bad feelingsforgotten at the hospital.
In the wards, however, workers com-
plain most about the lack of help and
time. “It’s not rightthat you don’ti‘have
time to talk to a depressed girl, but -you
just can’t,” says one nurse.
Staff absenteeism in the more‘trou-

.blesome-wards ranges as high as; 10 per

cent because of. the low pay and -few
prospects" for advancement, says _a re-
cently appointed, young supervisor.
During his tour of a ward, the super-
visor ‘comes’ upon a young woman strap-

‘ped by her hands and feet into a bed.
' She was severely bitten on the nose by a

patient usually tied to a bench. The at-
tack victim was put in the bed because
she kept touching the stitches on her
nose. ‘ ‘
“Don’t worry, honey,” s a y s t h _e
nurse, stroking the head of the patient
who stirs uncomfortably in the bed._
.“Something like «this wouldn’t have

' happened. if wehad enough staff here,’_’

says the supervisor. The nurse nods her
head casually, it-is a remark she‘ seems
to have heard before. ' _ T
