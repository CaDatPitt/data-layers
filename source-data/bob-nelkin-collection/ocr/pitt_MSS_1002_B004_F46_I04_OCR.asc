INTRODUCTION

On October 18, 1978, Dr. David R. Hallace of the Bureau of Dental
Services of the Pennsylvania Department of Health received a request from
Mr. Peter P. Polloni, Deputy Secretary for Mental Retardation, and Mr.

Ford 5. Thompson, Regional Deputy Secretary, Central Region, of the Depart-
ment of Public welfare to conduct reviews of the dental services at the
Ebensburg and Cresson Centers.

The purposes of these reviews, as stated in the request, were:

1. To validate reviews of the dental services at these two
Centers which had been performed approximately two months
previously by Dr. Jay Reznik, a staff dentist at western
Center.

2. To make appropriate recommendations to the Department of
Public welfare.

3. To develop a review format that can be utilized at other
mental.retardation centers.

Recruitment of a survey team and confirmation of dates for the reviews
were finalized on November 21. The survey team was composed of Dr. Raphael
Rusynyk and Dr. John R. Clark from the Bureau of Dental Services, Pennsylvania
Department of Health; Dr. Donald Hensler, an oral surgeon and Chairman of the
Hospital and Institutional Dental Services Committee of the Pennsylvania
Dental Association; and Dr. Mamoun Nazif, a pedodontist and Chief of Dental

Services at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

The survey team visited Ebensburg and Cresson Centers on December 7 and
8.*
team on January 4, 1979, to interview the dentist and administrator.

A subsequent visit to Cresson Center was made by three members of the
Included
in the reviews were the staffing, physical facilities, equipment, records,
service delivery and institutional administration.

The following report presents the findings and recommendations of our
reviews.

* Dr. Reznik, whose previous survey was to be validated, requested that he
be an observer on the team. Mr. Ford Thompson, Regional Deputy Secretary,
concurred with this request. Rather than observe, Dr. Reznik was an active
participant in the review on December 7 and 8.

EBENSBURG CENTER

REVIEW METHODS‘

On December 7, 1978, the survey team met with the Board of Ebensburg
Center, at their request.’ Also present were the Center administrator and
dentist, the Regional Deputy Secretary and Dr. Reznik. The credentials
and experiences of the members of the team, the purpose of the review and
the methods to be utilized were discussed with the Board.

The dental facility was visited and an inspection made of the physical
space, equipment and supplies.

A sample of 17 residents, including seven which had been examined
previously by Dr. Reznik, were examined. Conditions present in the mouth,
including cavities, missing teeth, teeth in need of extraction, chipped
teeth, residual roots, restorations, gingival disease and oral hygiene were
noted and simultaneously compared with the patient's dental record. In
addition, the oral findings on those residents who had been examined pre-
viously by Dr. Reznik were compared with Dr. Reznik's findings.

EDn December 8, Dr. Brisini was interviewed by Drs. Clark and Rusynyk
with Dr. Reznik present. The interview questions were based on the content
of Dr. Reznik's survey report with which Dr. Brisini was not familiar, since
he had not been provided with a copy of the report.

Additional general information about the dental service was obtained
by having Dr. Brisini complete a survey form entitled, "Survey of Hospital
Dental Departments" developed by the American Dental Association. Patient
charts and monthly activities reports were also collected and evaluated by
the team.

FINDINGS

Of the 17 residents examined at Ebensburg:
87 surfaces of restoration are needed
9 fractured teeth were noted
17 teeth needed to be extracted
6 residents needed deposits removed and/or periodontal treatment
An approximation of the basic needs of the residents may be made by
multiplying these results by a factor of 50 based on a total population
of 850. These findings are in substantial agreement with Dr. Reznik's
previous survey.

A summary of dental services (approx.) at Ebensburg as submitted on
monthly activities reports from November 1977 to November 1978:.
1800 examinations
132 extractions
588 prophylaxis or cleanings
63 restorations
204 residents seen on am emergency basis
4 gingivectomies; 1 bridge; 3 plastic crowns; and 2 partials
were completed in the past year.

Lack of Dental Assistants: The Center has been without dental assistants

for approximately two years.

Lack of Dental Hygienists: The last dental hygienist was hired by the

administration in June, 1978, without any input or consultation from the
dentist. She left after one month of employment.

Inadequate Dental Facility; No consideration has been given to appro-
priate barrier freedom, space, design, flow patterns and the delivery of
dental services for this special population. The dental unit, the dental

chair, sterilization equipment, high speed hand pieces, central suction,
hand instruments, restraining or supporting devices and/or emergency kits
are either non-existent or grossly deficient. There are no general
anesthesia capabilities available. ,

FINDINGS (Continued)

The Dentist: The existing dentist under present circumstances (#1—5
_above) has not provided adequate services to the residents of the

Center. The quality of care is questionable in the areas of the

number of scalings performed during recall visits, follow-up care

of patients requiring extractions and restorations, utilization of
proper examination techniques and charting, and the implementation

of proper preventive measures. I

There is a lack of communication and understanding between the dentist,
the medical director and the administrator. This is highlighted by the
dentist's refusal to pursue improvements in his area and the adminis-

«trations's failure to properly supervise and support the dentist, as

well as consult with him before hiring hygienists or assistants who are
to work under his supervision. ‘

The Administration: Although the administration has expressed interest

in upgrading the quality and quantity of care for the residents, there
were no documented attempts to express these desires to the dentist.

RECOMMENDATIONS

SHORT—RANGE GOALS

10.

11.

Hire an equivalent of two full-
time dental assistants. Educational courses and specialized
training should be undertaken with a
university or private entity knowledge-

able in treating the handicapped.

Hire an equivalent of one full-
time dental hygienist.

£1;/§J\—-f§.é

Hire the equivalent of one additional full-time dentist, preferably two
or more, who are trained and interested in the care of multi-handicapped
patients.

Salaries should be increased to attract dentists with formal post-graduate
education.

Seek a new area for the dental program or expand the existing area to
allow a minimum of two operatories. A waiting and recovery area should

be included in this new arrangement.

Install new equipment appropriately designed for the delivery of dental
services to the handicapped.

Require the existing dentist to take a minimum number of continuing edu-
cational credits during the next 12-month period. Such courses should
include a minimum of 7 credit hours in the basic management of severely

handicapped patients and a minimum of 14 credit hours on sedation techniques.

Establish referral sources; i.e., hospitals, pedodontists, other specialists,
that are able to treat these special people, when required.

Encourage the dentist(s) to establish a close association to the local
dental society.

Implement an on-going preventive program which includes appropriate uses
of fluorides and training of residents and staff in proper oral hygiene

techniques.

After basic improvements have been made in the facility and equipment,
auxiliaries have been employed, and other clinic related deficiencies
have been corrected, the dentist should be placed on probation for a

11.

12.

period of one year. Periodic evaluations of his clinical activities
by a qualified, neutral dentist(s) should determine whether he is
fulfilling his obligations to the Center. Appropriate action should

then follow based on the neutral dentist(s) recommendations.

1

The administration should actively involve the medical director and
the dentist in the implementation of the above recommendations.

INTERMEDIATE GOALS

1.

A manual of procedures should be developed and.implemented. The manual
should include descriptions of acceptable minimal performance of pro-

cedures, such as examining, charting, treatment planning and priorities,

referring residents for special treatment and conducting a preventive

program, as well as administrative responsibilities such as personnel
procedures, professional duties and decorum, obtaining consent and co-
ordinating treatment.

Standardized reporting and recording forms should be adopted.

An electronic data processing system should be developed and implemented.

Peer review teams should be hired to conduct periodic reviews at the
institution. These teams should include three qualified dentists with‘
a minimum of five years of clinical experience. At least one should

have experience in treating handicapped patients.

In order to meet the need for general anesthesia capability, consider:
A. The establishment of a special team for surgical and restorative
procedures under general anesthesia.
B. The establishment of referral agreement with Lee Hospital in
Johnstown.
C. The establishment of referral agreement with Altoona Hospital.

Make every effort to influence curriculum planning in dental schools to
reguire training in treating handicapped persons for all students.

LONG-RANGE GOALS

1.

Consider the estabiishment of Ebensburg Center as a regionai faciiity
for treatment and education/training. A training grant should be
sought or monies aiiofted to estabiish a reiationship with the University
of Pittsburgh's Schooi of Dentai Medicine for ciinicai rotation of

residents, pre-doctorai, dentai assisting and dental hygiene students.
Opportunities for data coiiection and research information.

Utiiization of dentai facilities by communities.

DISCUSSION

Dental care for the handicapped is a very difficult and demanding
task.

factors were taken into consideration when evaluating the shortcomings
of the existing dental services and arriving at our recommendations. .

Our findings reveal that a crisis, rather than maintenance and pre-

it will not be alleviated. Immediate action should be forthcoming to correct
this situation.

The reason for the current situation can be traced primarily to the
funding of dental services in such facilities. Only competitive salaries,
together with liberal vacation and sick leave, will provide adequate incen-
tives for young dentists and auxiliaries to work effectively under such
difficult conditions. The availability of dentists trained in the care of
handicapped patients is limited. Therefore, employing general dentists
with limited or no experience in treating handicapped persons should be
considered. However, such dentists should have a sincere interest in caring
for handicapped persons and be willing to take a minimum of 48 continuing

education credits in the care of the handicapped.

The administration has the ultimate responsibility to properly budget
and appropriate funds and to procure treatment so that the dental health
status of the residents is maintained at an acceptable level.
