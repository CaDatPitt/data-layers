Dear TOIII,

This is in response to your request for a legal
opinion regarding the impact of a proposed amendment to
senate Bill 94, dealing with community residential
facilities for the mentally ill, mentally retarded, and
other individuals. The amendment would define the facility
as one providing residence for, among others,

0

"mentally ill persons who do not pose a clear
and present danger of harm to themselves or
others, and who were not, within the past two
years, receiving mental health treatment under
Article IV of Act 143." —

Specifically, you have asked whether the above-language
would permit dangerous mentally ill persons to reside in
these facilities. My answer is in the negative. Initially,
no person who is subject to civil commitment under state law
would meet the limitation of danger to himself or others.

The standard for involuntary commitment includes persons who,
because of mental illness, "pose a clear and present danger

of harm to others or to himself." 50 P.S. S 730l(a). The
clear and present danger may come in turn, be shown by overt
behavior within 30 days, as specified in S 7301GT). If a
person met these standards, he would be subject to involuntary
commitment upon petition of any responsible party, rather

than being a fit subject for community residential facility.
See also 5 305, 50 P.S. 5 7305, regarding standards fo
continued involuntary commitment. -

The reference to Article IV of Act 143, 50 P.S. S 7401
gt §gg., would have a further effect of excluding persons
committed to mental hospitals via the criminal justice system.
This would include persons (1) charged with crime and in
detention or undergoing sentence (50 P.S. S 7401); (2) committed
to determine their competency to stand trial (50 P.S. § 7402);
(3) committed following a determination of incompetency to
stand trial (50 P.S. §§7403, 7406); (4) committed following an
acquittal by reason of lack of responsibility (50 P.S. §§7404,
7406); and (5) committed for examination in aid of sentencing
