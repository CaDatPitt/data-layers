We have reviewed our Supervisor's Daily Report and Critical Incident

,Report for April 15, 1975, concerning Carl Fisher who was reported‘

missing on April 14 and was found deceased today.

Carl's last contact with our personnel occurred at 12:30 P.M. on April
1% when he asked MRA I Willis Boyd if he could go for a walk in the

yard outside the cottage at Hillcrest colony. Mr. Boyd instructed Carl
that he may go out for a walk but not to leave the lawn area." He was
last seen standing in the lawn area outside the cottage at approximately
1:00 P.M. Following the shift change at 2:00 P.M., Mr. Fred Young, MRA

"II, was unable to find him. Mr. Young searched for Carl in the grounds

immediately surrounding the cottage as well as within the building proper
and notified the Northsidg.Supervisor of Carl's absence at 3:00 P.M. Our
only other possible information to account for Carl's leaving the’area
came as a result of questioning other residents. Joseph Martino, a resi-
dent of Hillcrest colony, said that Carl had left soon after dinner saying
that "there was too much snoring at night." ~ '

A description of Carl and the clothing which he was wearing was tiven to
Security Officers by Mr. Young when they began to investigate the incident
shortly after 3:00 P.M. Our Northside Supervisor notified Security immed-

_iately following V . Young's report, and a number of MRA's participated in

the search party which consequently found Carl on April 15. Between 3:00
P.M. on‘April 15 and 1:00 P.M. on April 15 our personnel had no further

-contact with the situation.
