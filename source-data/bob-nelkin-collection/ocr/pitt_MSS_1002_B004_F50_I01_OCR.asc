BUILDINGS VISITED: No. 3, 4 and 6
Vocational Adjustment Services

I PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS

A. Exterior - Grounds and buildings were well maintained.

3. Interiors - All buildings visited were very clean and free of offensive odors.
although the air was stale due to lack of open windows and there was a distinct disin-
fectant smell. In Bedroom I of west l of Harmony House (#3), there was an overpowering
smell of urine. The nurse felt it might be a soaked rug, but she didn't ask anyone to check
it out while the team was present. There have been attempts made to brighten the interiors,
including wall murals in day rooms, drapes and bedspreads in sleeping areas. Plastic fur-
niture has replaced wooden benches. However, there still exists the need for more in the
way of interior decoration. Day rooms, where residents spend the major part of the day,
are still very institutional in appearance. The drapes in the day rooms of Building 4
were torn down. Staff indicated this had been done by the residents. PARC suggests the
use of Velcor tape backing (See Mr. Joe Colombatto's AAMD Journal article.) There is the
need for an effort to make the day rooms more comfortable for residents. This could be
done by the addition of pgrsonal furniture, such as rockers, strato loungers, etc. This
has been done at other state centers.

The team is aware that residents in these units would need a good deal of training
in the care and use of such furniture. However, if the goal at Ebensburg is to create as
normalizing a setting as possible, this includes furniture beyond the institutions,
"indestructible" type now found in the dayrooms.

PARC would like to know whether or not plans are being made to purchase comfortable
personal furniture with resident funds, and whether or not the care and use of this furni-
ture will be a part of the goal plans for residents.

Additionally, if there is no problem with incontinent residents, the team suggests the
purchase of area carpeting. Once again, members of the team have seen this done in other
centers with success. Carpeting with nonskid backing brightens up the interior of dayrooms
and gives them a warmer, home-like appearance.

-2- -

Living areas also lacked any evidence of personal possessions, games, magazines, or
instructional materials or equipment. In Harmony House, west 1, Bedroom l, for example,
there was evidence of personal possession in one bed area. Another resident in Building 3
had a personal radio. Staff indicated personal possessions were locked in a storage room.
Since most adult residents of Units 3 and 4 spend the major part of the day in the dayroom,
this lack of equipment or any materials designed to stimulate residents or occupy their
time is a serious omission. This lack of a stimulating environment is detrimental to the
residents growth and development, and should not be allowed to continue.

PARC asks that a plan be developed by staff to identify furnishing and equipment to
be purchased for the dayrooms which will provide activities and stimulation for residents
in buildings 3 and 4.

The team also noted that chests of drawers, ostensibly purchased to comply with MA
requirements for personal storage furniture, were empty in all buildings visited. (This
is over 300 empty chesusof drawers.) Staff was vague as to reasons for the empty drawers.

The team was disturbed by this outward compliance with the “letter of the Law,“ while
ignoring the intent of this regulation. while the purchase of all this furniture repre-
sents a substantial expenditure of money, the drawers are not used. Personal clothing is
not stored in the drawers, nor are any personal possessions. Thus the chests of drawers
are a token gesture to normalization. Residents have not been taught to use the drawers.
Clothing is still passed out to residents in "bath bundles“ and stored in clothing rooms.

PARC would like to know why these chests are not used, and when residents will, in

fact, be taught to use the furniture and encouraged to keep clothing and personal possessions
in them. while the team realizes that not all of the residents‘ clothing can be stored in
these drawers, there seems to be no reason why a one or two-day supply of clothing could not
be kept in them, with residents gradually taught to select their clothing from the drawers

in the morning.

The team noted a memo on the bulletin board of the Administration Building at Ebensburg
outlining the Center's commitment to the philosophy of normalization.

It was disturbing to note that many conditions exist in the physical surroundings

which are not normalizing. Many of these can and should be corrected. The sinks in the
bathrooms are one example. PARC suggests that DPN replace the pushbutton fixtures on the
sinks with hot and cold faucets. Has this been explored? Have estimates been sought? PARC
asks that Sbensburg seek estimates on replacing these awkward. inappropriate fixtures with
faucets the residents can learn to use. The present fixtures make learning washing and
toothbrushing difficult.

The lack of privacy in the toileting area is also a condition which must be alleviated
immediately. There is simply no excuse for not enclosing toilet stalls with either a
curtain or doors. This lack of privacy is degrading and dehumanizing for residents and as
such should not be tolerated. PARC asks that the DPW put an end to the practice of lack of
privacy in toileting and bathing areas at Ebensburg immediately.

II. FOOD AND FOOD SERVICE

Food was served cafeteria style in the buildings visited. The meal observed (lunch)
was hot and well balanced. Residents received seconds upon request.

The staff in Building 4 indicated that the feeding team is needed in this building.
Aides on duty during lunch were helping those who needed assistance, but it was evident
that more help was needed.

-3-

PARC would like to know when family style dining will be initiated, where appropriate,
at Ebensburg. The team felt that residents from Building 6 are capable of family style
dining, where some of those in Building 4 could also benefit from this more normalizing type
of food service.

A PARC report from a visit made in December l975 noted the need for a family style din-
ing program and recomended that this type of food service be initiated as soon as possible.
To date, at least in Buildings 4 and 6, this has not been done. Is family-style dining
availablﬁ in any building? Are plans being made to initiate this program in Building 6?

so, w en.

The team urges that the feeding team work with residents in Building 4. Staff there
are trying to help residents develop self-feeding skills, but they need help.

III CLOTHING

Residents‘ clothing has improved since the last visit by NARC. The team noted
attractive, appropriate clothing on at least half the residents. However, the remaining
residents were still wearing unattractive, drab, "state—made" clothing. For example.
clothes didn't fit many of the residents (too big, too small) In Building 3, west l, it
was noted that residents did not wear belts. As a result, pants which were too big or
loose around the waist were falling down on at least 6 residents. The nurse and living
skills instructor had no explanation as to why no one was permitted to wear a belt.

Staff in Building 4 noted that about half the residents now have a clothing supply which is
mainly composed of commercially-manufactured clothing. Staff is working toward purchasing
clothing for all residents.

The team noted several exceptions to the above. Residents of Building 4, East l were
not dressed in attractive clothing. For example, one young boy during lunch was observed
wearing a ripped T-shirt, trousers which were too big, and no shoes. Many residents wore
plain grey, green, or dark trousers and plain white T-shirts, white socks, etc. The team
could not help but notice how much this institutional attire detracted from the residents‘
appearance.

PARC recommends that Ebensburg contact Dr. Robert Shushan, for information and slides
regarding clothing, hair styles, etc. His presentation would make an excellent in-service
training topic.

LINENS

The laundry problem noted in 1975 has been solved. Staff in all buildings noted that
laundry was done on time and there were no shortages.

The team was not able to determine whether a daily personal linen supply was available
or not. There were no towels hanging in the bathroom area. Nashcloths were placed by
metal wash basins and residents were washed after lunch.

The team noted the absence of paper towels or soap in the bathrooms. There was no
toilet paper in evidence in Building 6.

IV. APPEARANCE OF RESIDENTS
The team noted improvements in the overall appearance of residents. Residents did

not appear as lethargic as noted in the previous visit. However, there still exists the
need for more attention to the appearance of the residents.

-4-

Hair styles, for example, were still institutional in appearance. A number of resi-
dents were unshaven. Clothing has already been mentioned. There still exists the need for
corrective and restorative dentistry.

In Building 4, there were at least six residents scratched or bruised noticeably. (See
Section on Program.)

Once again, PARC recommends that Ebensburg staff make an effort at improving the
appearance of the residents through personalized clothing, hair styling, etc. He would like
to know what Ebensburg plans to do about this continuing problem. There are too many re-
sources available to allow this neglect of the appearance of residents to continue.

The team visiting Building 3 also noted that many of the boys returning from school
were dressed in clothing which again was institutional in appearance. (Colorless or faded
T-shirts. polo shirts, and unattractive trousers.) The team recommends that these boys be
sent to school in more stylish, attractive clothing.

V PROGRAM

The team visited the VAS program and noted that this program is well developed. l3O
residents are enrolled in a six hour per day program, (High Skilled) while another 70 are
enrolled in a 3-hour daily program (low skilled). According to the VAS Director, 400 are
served in VAS in the I.U. program. NOTE: There seems to be some discrepancy in numbers
which puzzles the team. According to the VAS director, a total of 600 people are enrolled
in some type of VAS activity. According to Dr. Hartley, there are 500 under 21 students,
with 410 educated by the I.U. off grounds and 90 on grounds. The total census is 830. Does
this mean that: l30 residents receive a full-day program from VAS?.

70 residents receive a 3-hour daily program from VAS?

400 under 2l residents receive VAS training from the I.U.? -
l00 under 21 residents do n9t_receive VAS training through the I.U.?
230 residents are not served by either the I.U. or VAS?

would Ebensburg please clarify this area.

Several hundred residents have gone out successfully into the community as a result of
being work oriented and ready for workshop placement when they arrive in the community.

The residents are trained to travel to the workshop building independently. Money
skills are taught, and residents are taken to town on pay day to purchase things with the

"money they have earned. They are evaluated quarterly and trained in tasks with up to 60

variables. Thirty percent move from the low skill area to the high skilled area each year.
Tasks are work simulated (no contracts.)

The VAS director listed priorities for the program as:

l. More staff

2. More space

3. Support of the program in the institutions budget not through
Title I grants, as is now the case.

Team members visiting Building 6 were advised that residents receive on the average
of 3.75 hours per day of programming. The Unit Manager indicated that of the l22 residents,
27 are involved in an over 21 special education program; 43 residents are in need of this
program; l5 residents are involved in the Vocational Adjustment program on the grounds and
35 are enrolled in the I.U. program.

-5-
Staff in this building noted a number of problem areas. There is a pressing need for
the development of behavior modification programs. Residents of Building 6 were
characterized as hyperactive. There is no psychologist assigned to the Unit. In this
building, as in Building 4, behavior controlling drugs have been reduced. Staff noted,
however, that in Building 6, acting out behavior is increasing and the use of physical
restraints has been increased. No individual programs are available to deal with problem
genaviors. Additionally, lack of programming and activities contributes to anti-social
e aviors.

The call off rate, in Building 6, according to the Unit Manager is the lowest in the
institution. However, on 3l9 different occasions in the past 6 months, staff were pulled
to other areas of Ebensburg. This results in no consistency or continuity in dealing with
residents‘ needs and problems. The Superintendent indicated that he is unable to do any-
thing about this practice because of DPN Regulations.

PARC has noted this disrupted practice in every state institution. Regulations which
disallow overtime and force "pulling" of aides from one area to another operate to the detri-
ment of the residents. This is especially true in areas where residents need intensive pro-
gramming for behavior modification. PARC urges that the DPN examine this policy and de-
termine what can be done to make the policy flexible enough to preclude the "pulling" of
staff in areas where residents need intensive training. Staffing patterns should be deter-
mined by resident need -- not by rigid, inflexible policies.

The team visiting Building 4 was disturbed at finding all four wards locked. During
lunch staff indicated that only one ward was locked. However, between 12:30 and l:45, all
wards were locked. The team returned again at 4:00 p.m. to determine if the wards were
still locked. They were! In addition, three team members noted that attendants were
sitting in chairs during the time the team was in Building 4, East 2. They were not inter-
acting with residents, leading an activity, teaching self care, waking sleeping residents.
or attending to scratches, bruises, shiners, scab picking, etc. Also, the team observed
staff standing around the East I ward of this building. They were not attendin to or
reacting with residents. The Unit Manager indicated “activity is not in their ?aides')
job description." In West l of Building 3, at 3:15 p.m., a few balls were out but there
was no activity. It was explained that this was “nap time" and residents were lying
around. PARC questions the need for "nap time" for adult residents who have very little
activity or programming all day. This time would be better used for play. exercise. etc.
A “quiet time“ might be necessary for the school-age children when they get home from
school. but the team questioned the inactivity of the other residents.

Additionally, PARC feels that the practice of mixing children and adults in the same
ward or unit is one which should be examined. Is there some reason why children are mixed
in the same living unit as adults?

Staff indicated that all residents were locked in because several of the residents
would run away if the doors were unlocked. There are l24 residents in the building; 54
go to school; 70 stay in the building for most of the day due to lack of programming or
activities. Thus, on the day of the visit, 70 residents were literally "locked up" because
some of them would run away.

In l975, PARC noted locked wards in Buildings 3, 4, 5, and 6. During this visit,
four wards were locked in Building 4. The practice of locking up 70 people because 10
or l2 would run away is restrictive, excessive and punitive. Further, the needs of the
residents in Building 4 for behavior modification are not being met.

Staff indicated that many residents of this building are hyperactive and obusive.
Several residents (the team counted 6) were visibly marked with bruises,scratches, etc.
One resident had a swollen face and black eye. Staff indicated these bruises were caused
either by self-abuse or by one resident attacking another. In spite of the obvious need

-5-

of these residents for intense programming. and for activities which would involve and
stimulate them, residents were observed from l2:30 to l:45 laying around, sitting around.
rocking, or walking around in their day rooms. Staff was also sitting, and there was

no interaction taking place on the wards between aides and residents. Staff indicated

that other than programs in feeding, dressing and toileting, there is no relevant pro-
gramming in Building 4. The team advised the Unit Manager of a successful behavior modifi-
cation program at western State. It may be helpful to the staff to visit this program.

when the team returned to the building at 4:00 p.m. to see if any activity was taking
place during that shift, the team was advised to take some residents to the canteen. How-
ever, the majority of the residents were still lying or sitting around. The team also
observed that only one resident from this building was outside even though it was a warm,
sunny fall day.

It was also noted that many residents in Building 3 need more intensive Physical
Therapy. Several residents were positioned badly on mats, others were sitting in wheel
chairs which needed adaptive devices. (Examples: foot rest several inches below resi-
dent's feet, two residents with heads tilted completely to the side, etc.) A staff member
indicated in west ll of Building 3, that there is “nothing they can do" for one resident
(Jimmy R). what about positioning, etc? Another resident (George) is seen by Physical
Therapy. which is done by the Physical Therapist and the P.T. aides. However, it was indi-
cated that there is no P.T. follow through on the Unit.

PARC suggests that Ebensburg contact JoAnne Rodgers at the Home for Crippled Children
to see if a training program for aide staff could be given to Ebensburg employees. This
training course has been given to staff at several State Centers with great success.

PARC must again protest this lack of programming and the practice of locked wards.
There are two full-time psychologists assigned to this unit. PARC must ask why staff
is not involved in an intensive behavior modification program. Certainly this is desperately
needed by those residents who, because of their behavior, need to be maintained in a locked,
secure setting. Ebensburg is one of the last State Centers to continue the practice of
locked wards for numbers of people.

There is a need for program staff to work with these residents. This need has

existed for a long time and was documented in the PARC report of the December l975 visit.
Yet almost two years later, residents of Building 4 and some residents of Building 3 receive
only sporadic programming. They are deprived of their liberty and the opportunity to grow
and develop. There is no excuse for these conditions continuing to exist in any institution
in Pennsylvania.

PARC again asks that a plan to deal with these problems be developed and shared with
PARC as soon as possible.

VIII DENTAL AND MEDICAL CARE

The need for corrective and restorative dentistry is still evident at Ebensburg. Team
members were assured that there is an active dental hygiene program.

The problem of excessive medication noted in the l975 PARC report, has been addressed
by Ebensburg. There has been a substantial reduction in the numbers and amounts of drugs
used. However, lack of programming is causing an increase in the use of physical restraints.

IX STAFF ATTITUDE

The team encountered a number of different staff attitudes during the visit and discus-
signs with staff members. There was extreme concern expressed by the supervisory staff in
Buildings 3 and 4 over the lack of needed programming for the adults in these buildings.

-7-

The need for program staff was described over and over again. Staff was extremely
concerned for the well being of the residents.

As noted before, teams visiting Buildings 3 and 4 observed many aide staff sitting
or standing. There was little interaction between aide staff and residents noted during
the time the team was in the buildings. The team was not able to determine whether or not
aide staff were assigned duties during working hours which would involve them in working
with residents. The team did note several aides in toilet areas with residents for a time and
the team assumes that this is a part of the toilet training program. However, beyond this,
there were no activities going on in the dayroom. The team questions whether or not staff
in Unit 4 has been trained in behavior modification techniques.

_ There appears to be a need to clarify and define the role of staff in relation to
residents. The need for aide training and involvement in behavior shaping is also apparent.

PARC also questions the scheduling of activity staff. Shouldn't some activities be
scheduled during the 7:30 - 3:30 shift, since residents have nothing to do all day. There
seems to be a need to study the staffing patterns of Buildings 3 and 4 to determine what
staffing would best meet the needs of residents.

X RIGHTS OF RESIDENTS

Residents right to treatment is violated in Buildings 3 and 4 by the lack of pro-
gramming. Locked wards are another violation of residents rights. Lack of privacy in
toileting areas is also another violation of residents rights.

XI SUMARY

There have been some improvements made since the last visit by a PARC Team to Ebensburg.
These include reduction of drugs, improved appearance of residents, opening up of locked
areas in three buildings, and elimination of the laundry problem.

However, the presence of locked wards in Building 4, lack of relevant programming for
some residents of Buildings 3, 4 and 6 are all residual problem areas which have not been
dealt with at this time. Although 20 new special education teaching positions have been
confirmed for Ebensburg. these have not yet been added to the complement. PARC would like
to know definitely when these positions will actually be filled. The addition of this type
of space will help with the problem of no programming and hyperactive behavior. But more
must be done in the area of behavior shaping.

PARC must once again express dismay and concern over the lack of concrete action on
the part of the Department of Public welfare in addressing these problems, and demand that
solutions be devised immediately to meet the needs of these residents at Ebensburg.
