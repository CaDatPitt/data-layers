Inquest ordered‘?
in Polk death 

Nu. .

By FRAN FRY J13. '

A coroner’s inquest has been
ordered into the Oct. 16 death of
a resident of Polk State School
and Hospital.

Coroner Jonathan Hutchinson
today revealed he was in-

. structed by. District Attorney

‘Miles Lynn to schedule an
inquest into the death of
Raymond Paul Helman, 32, who
was strangled by a restraint
strap."

Helman was a resident of
Cottage One at the time of his
death. This is an area which
was used for residents with

. behavioral problems.

The coroner said that he ruled
death was caused by
asphixiation, due to
strangulation. This was
determined by an autopsy, but
he never ruled if the death was
homicide, suicide or ac-
cidential.

‘Hutchinson said he has to
confer with the district attorne_\‘
in the case, but that the inquest
would probably be held
sometime in September.

Hutchinson revealed there
has been additional evaluation
of a suspect in the case and they
now feel he is able to at least
cooperatewitli legal counsel if it
is necessary to conduct a trial.

It was reported the suspect

was examined recently by a '

Pittsburgh psychiatrist and he
ruled he would not be able to
stand trial. A source today
revealed that the suspect was
sent to Warren State Hospital
and his condition was
reevaluated.

The suspect was a resident of
the same cottage where Helman
was found dead. He reportedly
admitted killing Helman, but
the state police have not filed
charges against him because
they did not feel he was capable
of standing trial.
