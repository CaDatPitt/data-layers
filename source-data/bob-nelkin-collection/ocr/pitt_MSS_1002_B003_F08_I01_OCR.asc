_Dear Mr. Hiltner:

with reference to our son, Mark- a resident at Western
State School and Hospital, Pine Lodge II, regarding the medical
management surrounding his grand mal seizures in July 1973 and
this past week of December 20th to 22nd of 1973.

' -As responsible parents we have co-operated and given our_hest.
assistance to the Social Service Dept. and medical staff whenever
possible for the management and care of Mark since he became a
resident at WSSH. A part of this assistance was to give a complete
report of Mark's history and our knowledge of his medical treat-
ment prior to his admission. This history was given in writing

and made available to the Social Service Dept., as well as the med-
ical staff. In addition, special conferences were held with the
Social Service and medical staff after his admission and again
after the July episode of seizures to convey peritent information
for the medical treatment of Mark.

After Mark's episode of convulsive seizures in July, we in-
quired at various meetings with Social Service and medical staff
for causes of repeated seizures. we were consistently getting in-
complete information pertinent to Mark's condition specifically
in the area of drug usage: and the changing of drugs before a
thorough analysis and evaluation was made with.regards to his med-
ical history. In addition, a severe gum condition had ﬁevelopeﬁ,
This information was withheld from us and when we-inquired inac-
curate-information was given to us. After the drug program was
changed, we were not imfoned that Mark was developing a pattern of
seizures until he developed a grand mal seizure as a result.

It appears that the management of Mark's treatment for his
seizures this past week is a reoccurence of mismanagement and
insufficient treatment for his condition similar to the episode
which occured in July of this year.

Reconsidering all these past experiences we do not feel that
Mark is receiving the best medical and dental treatment that he
is entitled to receive at WSSH. ’

We have received unsatisfactory answers from some of the med-
ical staff when we inquire about the medical management given to
Mark.

and medical treatment)and to
