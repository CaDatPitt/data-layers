SUBJECT: Investigation of resident death at Polk State School

and Hospital -

.-

( V

A site investigation was made to Polk State School and Hos ital for
the specific purpose of inquiring into the death of Raymong P. Helman,
age 32, on October 17, 1972. The coroner's report indicated death
was due to asphyxiation from strangulation but an API release, this
date, reported that the State Police in Franklin were holding a res-
ident of the State School for suspected homicide.‘ It was this news
release that prompted an immediate inquiry.

The investigation team was made up of Ronald«Archer, Associate Dir-
ector of ACC-PARC; Henry Peaeeh, Post Gazette reporter; and the
undersigned. Vnéfcﬂz

We arrived at the Pennsylvania State Police Barracks, Franklin, Pa.
at approximately 1:00 P.M. and spoke with sergeant Joll and a cor-
poral. They reported that *, age 18, was the suspected
resident in question. ‘made a confession gas did two other
residents, but his was far more accurate and thééwthe only plausible
confession. _is a borderline (65-75 IQ) MR who can drive
a car. ' Their record indicates that  has stolen cars from
the grounds and has been A.W.O.L. from the institution several times.
Charges have been withheld pending the completion of a psychiatric
examination by Dr. Johnson of Franklin. 7. has remained in
the custody of Polk State School where the examination is being con-
ducted.

An_autopsy on Helman was performed by Dr. Griffin a Pathologist at
Franklin Hospital. A large piece of window glass was found in Helman's
stomach during the autopsy.

The staff attempted to revive this victim with mouth to mouth resus-
citation and by so doing had released the cord and restraint before
the authorities were notified.

The Coroner, Jonathan Hutchinson is a mortician and the District
Attorney is Miles Linn. They are to review the findings of Dr.
Johnson and the evidence in the near future to determine the final
disposition of this case.

The officers volunteered information that their relationship with
"Doc" (Dr. Mcclelland, Director of Polk) was a good one and that
the last incident of this kind occurred in 1968.

The inspection team proceeded directly to Polk State School and was
immediately seen by the Director, Dr. James H. Mcclelland. After a.
brief introduction, Dr. Mcclelland received a phone call from
someone named Bob and said "the gentleman you spoke to me about is
here in my office now." Dr. Mcclelland appeared to speak freely

to the caller concerning the incident. He mentioned that hopefully
the District Attorney and the Coroner would meet Wednesday or
Thursday of this week to make a final decision.

After.the call Dr. Mcclélland asked us again for our names and our
connection with PARC. If he was startled to learn that Mr. Pearce
was a reporter, it was not apparent. "

Dr. Mcclelland answered our questions freely. He was quite hesitant

though to give the names of the attendents when'asked by Mr. Pearee,.

but did give us this information. A summary of the informationF“*°”“‘
given us by Dr. Mcclelland is as follows:

Raymond Helman was admitted to Polk on June l5, 1950. Prior to that
he was a resident of Torrance State Hospital for approximately 1 1/2
years. Commitment was by court order. Helman was a paraplegic

with spasticity of the upper extremities. He was ambulatory, but
only with the help of the attendents or other residents. His be-
havioral problem was wandering about at night awakening the residents
or poking at them. He liked to be hurt and to hurt others. He was
strong despite his handicap. It was for this reason that he was
placed in Cottage #1, a long range maximum security detention unit
for residents with aberrant behavioral problems. Therapy is diff—g
icult but various programs are carried out by professional staff.

Detention itself ust also be conside ed as ;%Erapeutic.

Mr. David Martin was th night attenden
He remained on the ground floor most of the evening which is cus-
tomary and checks the sleeping residents on the floor above at least
six times per evening. At 5:15 A.M. of October 17, Mr. Martin found
Helman out of bed. It had become necessary to restrain Helman in
his bed to prevent him from disturbing the others and Mr. Martin
refastened the restraint at that time.

The restraint (only discribed by Dr. Mcclelland) was a canvas jacket
laced up the back. It did not impede the free movement of arms

and legs. A long cotton cord was laced through the waist bank and
the ends were wrapped around the bed rails several times and tied ~

When Mr. Martin re yed the cordjone long est of excess cord was left

on the floor. Mr. Martin returned to his station downstairs. At
5:40 A.M., Mr. Martin returned to the sleeping quarters specifically
to arouse one diabetic patient at the opposite end of this room

from Helman. At 5:55 A.M. the day attendent, Mr. Joseph Wertz,
arrived and Mr. Martin took the diabetic patient downstairs and then
directly to the dispensary for his insulin injection. Mr. Wertz
went upstairs, turned on the overhead lights to arouse the res-
idents and found Helman sitting on the floor with the loose end of
cord around his neck. ; - ”

Dr. Mcclelland took us to‘Cottage #1. There were approximately
eight residents and four attendents in the cottage at the time.
Dr. Mcclelland gave a brief explanation of the aberrant behavior

of several of the residents.  d

An attendent accompanied us to the second floor sleeping quarters.
The locked door opened into the center of a large room with a double
row of beds. Each bed was made up with sheets, white spread and
pillows. All were clean and many have been changed that morning.
There was approximately 1 l/2 - 2 feet between beds.

Helman's bed was the last one on the right. The diabetic's bed was
to the left of the door an_‘s bed was at the far left.
See attached diagram. S'usp;¢-P:

Helman's body was found in a sitting position facing the wall with
his back against the bed.

The attendent confirmed an earlier statement by Dr. Mcclelland that

3@R—T’—and Helman were well acquainted and t  helped
u e

Helman several times. The attendent also assured n voices

could be heard readily by the attendent on duty downstairs.

The overhead lights were turned out and since the sky was heavily
overcast the room was darkened considerably. It seems possible that
Mr. Martin could not have noticed Helman's body if he were on the
floor at the 5:40 A.M. time despite the night lights and exit light
near the bed. (When Dr. Mcclelland demonstrated the position of

the body he sat erect against the bed with his head and neck clearly
visible - it is not known how tall Mr. Helman was or how erect he
may have been because of the restraining jacket).

Helman had surgery on September 11 for the removal of six spoons,
three popsicle sticks and several pieces of plastic knives. He was
released from the hospital on September 22 and returned to-Cottage
#1. Since he walked up and down the stairs twice a day and a good
city block to and from the dining room three times a day suggests
that he was fully recovered from his surgery. The autopsy report
indicated that healing was complete. ‘

Dr. Mcclelland stated that the district attorney had contacted the
public'defenders office as an insurance of the suspects rights. It
is not known if this public defender visited the suspect of not.
