Dear Norm:

The letters from Mike Levine and Mr. H. W.‘ to Dr. James McClelland Polk
State School and Hospital, are self-explana ory. After reading Mum
letter, I am sure you will agree it is very reasonable and balanced. _Ul e
frankly, I know many parents who would take a much more hostile attitude.

It does seem to me that if we are serious about normalization, use of the
telephone is one of the most normal activities. Possibly your regional task
force should address itself to this problem and advise you to a course of

action.

I will also refer this to our State School and Hospital and Interim Care
Committee.

Do you anticipate that we could have an opinion by January I?

Best personal wishes,

C. A. Peters
Executive Director
