also blood pressure is checked before and after exercising.

“Could weight watchers ‘be contacted to provide a WSSH Chapter'...?"

This is an interesting idea which received a good deal of positive
reaction from staff. There are a number of operational problems,
however, such as the special preparation of foods, exercise and
self-image training which cuts across several Departments which
will have to be worked out. we will explore this further and
report back at a later time.

"Appropriate socializing appeared to be missing at most luncheon
tables..."

The response to this comment must be on a Unit by Unit basis. On

many of the higher functioning units, primarily the Cottages and
Clinic II, a good deal of socializing takes place at meal time. In
other units where feeding training programs are underway, socializing
is actively discouraged in order that residents, who are easily dis-
tracted, can concentrate on their feeding tasks. with these residents
the focus is on learing the basic skills of feeding and eating, eg:
learning to carry their own tray through the line to gather good,
learning proper use of utensils, learning proper manners, as well as
swallowing, chewing, control of the tongue and sucking. with some
physically handicapped we have had to make adaptive equipment in order
to make them more self-sufficient. Efforts are made to teach manners,
such as "please" and "thank you". I believe that meal times, parti-
cularly breakfast and lunch, do tend to be a somewhat tense and hur-
ried affair with too little attention or time for socializing. we are
faced all too often in order, our present circumstances of overcrowd-
ing and too little staff, to require strict attention to learning the
skills associated with eating rather than having the time to permit
socializing.

"Has the cafeteria line been evaluated in terms of encouraging inde-
pendence or_preparing the resident for a real life situation in the

community?"

we are not all together sure of the intent or thrust of this question.
The facilities designed for western, eg. the Clinic Building and the
three Lodges were all designed with cafeteria style dining facilities.
Efforts are made to individualize arrangements for meals depending on
the needs of the residence unit or individual resident. For example,
meals are generally served on life support units, trays are taken to
handicapped residents who cannot manage the cafeteria line, etc.
Further, "family style" meal service is used in the former YDC Cot-
tages which were designed by this style of meal service. In the
Gateway Cottage residents purchase, prepare, and serve their own meals.
Efforts are also made to teach residents to prepare their own food and
serve it "family style" in the "practice apartment" program operated
by the VAS Department. The VAS Department is interested in extending
training in meal preparation and service, however, at this time they
do not have sufficient staff for this effort.
