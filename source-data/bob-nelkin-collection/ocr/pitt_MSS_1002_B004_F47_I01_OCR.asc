to you to be carried out in the balance of our MR State Centers.

I believe we have covered adequately the procedures that
will give us the assessment of dental services within the MR Centers
and which will enable us to determine any additional actions which
may need to be taken.

PROPOSED DENTAL SERVICE INVENTORY

Introduction

The Department of Public welfare and the Office of Mental Retardation
are committed to providing all of the professional services required to meet

the needs of the mentally retarded residents of State Centers. One such service

is the provision of appropriate dental care.

In recent months, a great deal of emphasis has been directed toward
the review of the dental services at two State Centers - Ebensburg and Cresson.
These reviews, while emphasizing specific problems at these two facilities, also
indicated the importance of completing similar reviews at all of the remaining
State Centers. This proposal details a process to inventory dental services
at each remaining State Center. Inventories will be completed during site
visits conducted by an independent (not employed at the facility) dentist.
These visits will be devoted primarily to completion of oral examinations on
a sample of approximately 10% of each facility‘s population. The dentist will
provide the Department a report in a format described herein which will be used
to define needs for improving dental services at each facility.

gFacility Priorities

The Office of Mental Retardation has established the following
facility priorities for the dental inventories:

1. Selinsgrove Center

2. white Haven Center

3. Hamburg Center

4. Polk Center

5. Noodhaven Center

6. western Center

7. Pennhurst Center

8. Marcy State Hospital

9.‘ Embreeville State Hospital
10. Laurelton Center

Time Frame for Completion

It is believed that a period of approximately two days will be
required to complete the dental inventories at each MR facility. In addition,
approximately three weeks will be required to complete each written report
and to prepare it for presentation for review to the facility, the Regional
Office and the Central Office of Mental Retardation. These time frames are
based on the experience of the review teams who completed the initial Dental
Reports for Cresson and Ebensburg Centers.

with these time frames in mind, and with the understanding that the
appropriate staff must have approximately one week to review the written
reports, the following tentative scheduled is proposed for the inventories:

This schedule would allow us to complete all facility reviews by

early January, 1980. ~

Personnel Completing Inventories

A single dentist will be utilized to complete the inventory at each

State Center.
1.

This person must:

Be appropriately licensed to practice dentistry in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Have experience in providing dental services directly
to developmentally disabled persons.

Be willing to accept the condition that all reviews
are the property of the Department and are for their
use.

This dentist would be assisted in the completion of the required
oral examinations by appropriate staff from the facility reviewed and/or the
staff person from the Office of Mental Retardation.

Inventory Coordination

An individual from the Department's Office of Mental Retardation
shall be designated with the following inventory responsibilities:

1.

will collect all pertinent background information
regarding the dental services and staff at each
State Center to be inventoried.

will oversee all activities related to the reviews,
including the establishment of any on-site meetings
with Department or facility personnel.

will coordinate the meeting to review the report with
the facility staff, the Regional Office staff and other
pertinent staff from the Department, following the

‘receipt of the dental inventory.

will develop a summary of recommendations, in an order
of priority, for referral and approval to the Deputy
Secretary for Mental Retardation. It should be noted
that is some or all of the recommendations are not
supportable, this person will prepare a statement as
to why that is the case prior to presentation to the
Deputy Secretary for Mental Retardation.

. .Will insure the timely compilation of quarterly updates

on the status of all recommendations by the responsible
Regional Office to the Deputy Secretary for Mental
Retardation. This status report will list any diffi-
culties in the implementation of any recommendation

and will propose any additional action which may be
necessary to provide quality dental services.

will prepare a final summary of all of the inventories
completed in the MR Centers, listing all recommenda-
tions implemented and a status report of all
recommendations for presentation to the Deputy
Secretary for Mental Retardation by the end of
January, 1980.

The Deputy Secretary will submit the report indicated
in No. 6 as well as any further recommendations for
system change to the Secretary of Public welfare.

Methodology
1. Presurvey

A. One month prior to the scheduled site visit, the OMR liaison will
inform the survey facility of their needs to compile the pre-site

xg visit information.

B. Two weeks prior to the scheduled site visit, the facility will
submit to the OMR liaison a complete package of the presurvey
information. '

C. ‘One week prior to the scheduled survey date, the OMR liaison will

_compile the pre-site information and provide it to the dentist.

D. One week prior to the site visit the OMR liaison will assure that

arrangements have been made at the facility.
2._ Site Visit "”

A.

B.

C.

On the day of the survey the following persons will be present:

1) the contracted dentist
2) OMR liaison .
(3) a facility liaison

The dentist will spend the majority of their time during the site
visit performing oral examinations on clients who are part of the
sample. They will also review records to compare the results of
the examination with existing documentation.

The
the

sample of clients to be examined will be approximately 10% of
facility population and will be constructed to approximate

the makeup of the facility population along the following dimensions:
(1) age

(2) sex

(3) level of mental retardation

4) presence of other physical handicaps (seizures, non—ambulatory)
5) responsible dentist

6) presence or absence of agressiveness

7) use of dilantin

-5-

D. ‘The dentist will complete a "Dental Inventory Report" (see
Attachment "A") for each facility. ’

.3. Post-Site Visit

A. The dentist's inventory report will be received by OMR within
three weeks of the date of the site visit.

B. A meeting between the facility Superintendent, the Regional
Commissioner and the OMR liaison person will be convened within
one week following receipt of the inventory in order to present
it to the facility.

C. The OMR liaison will follow up on the completion of all recommenda-
tions for immediate action. whenever it is not feasible to carry
out these actions, the OMR liaison will be responsible to explain
why and justify.

D. A summary of all inventories will be compiled within one month of
sthe completion of the final facility inventory.

E. Action steps will be developed in response to the Statewide
inventory summary by the OMR liaison. Those steps that are within
the scope of the Deputy Secretary's authority will be initiated.

F. Recommendations will be made to the Secretary of Public welfare
in order to carry out action steps that are not within the scope
of the Deputy Secretary's authority.

Projected Cost

A cost of $250 per day plus expenses will be required for the
dentist completing the reviews. Allowing this cost for a two—day review
plus an appropriate amount for expenses, it would indicate that each
facility inventory will cost an average of $600. The ten reviews will,
therefore, cost an estimated $6,000. The specific amount for each facility
will depend on the amount of expenses involved in travel lodging.

The dentist will be paid by contract with the Department out of
Appropriation 40 funds. It would be suggested that each facility inventoried
be responsible for assuming the cost of the dentist for the reviews completed
there. .
