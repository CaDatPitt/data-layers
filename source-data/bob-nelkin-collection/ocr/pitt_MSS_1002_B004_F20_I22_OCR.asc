Dear Governor:

As a concerned resident of Venango County, I wish to
protest the unfair and unjust critism of one of our states‘
and nations‘ BETTER residential facilities for the mentally
retarded -- namely Polk State School and Hospital.

The degrading manner in which Secretary Helene Wohlgemuth
fired Superintendent James H. McClelland, Jr., M. D. has had a
demoralizing effect not only on the staff at the school but
more importantly on the residents and their families.

I find it very frightening to live in a State where one
ill-informed appointed official has this kind of power. Power
to disturb thousands of lives. I find it doubly hard to believe

‘that you as Governor would sanction such action without conducting

an investigation and consulting with medical experts.

As a professional staff member of a Venango County Health
and Welfare agency, I question Mrs. Wohlgemuth's qualifications
for evaluating the care and treatment of the severely mentally
retarded and physically handicapped. For Mrs. Wohlgemuth to
rely on the emotionally biased opinion of a non-professional
organization (P.A.R.C.) is unjust and unfair.

I urge you to conduct a complete investigation into this
matter.

Sincerely,

0 - n c .' J -> .
