MEMO 19 CHAPTER PRESIDENTS & EXECUTIVES DME, APRIL 17, 1975
RIGHT TO EDUCATION COMMITTEE

ROGER E. BUCHANAN, CHAIRMAN
_RIGHT TO EDUCATION COMMITTEE

I DEMOUNTABLE CLASSROOMS PLANNED FOR WHITE HAVEN AND HAMBURG
STATE SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS .

HELP!!! INSTITUTIONALIZATION IS EXPANDING!!!” IT IS GOVERNOR'S
HOTLINE TIME AGAIN --— 800-932-0784.

we have lost twice at the State Task Force on Right to Education and
with the Secretary of Education, John C. Pittenger.

The Secretary has announced his intention to allow for the building of
classrooms on the grounds of Hamburg and white Haven. we ask that you call the
Governor and oppose for the following reasons.

1. This action is regarded by the Department of Education as the "least
desirable" and contrary to the Department's Plan which calls for the
"least restrictive alternative". we believe then that the Secretary's
decision is contrary to the Department's own position and to the Consent
Agreement, which provides for an “appropriate program of education".

It is argued that the classroom buildings are regarded as necessary
because no other alternatives are available. Let us argue that if the
Department really wanted to educate state school students off grounds,
that they have the fiscal and legal capacity to do so. The restraints
now imposed on the I.U. are regulations and laws which are reverseable.
If we argue strongly enough that institutionalized mentally retarded
students deserve the effort required to remove the constraints, they will
be removed.

The planning process leading to the Secretary's decision started with

the I.U. This is contrary to the Department's regulations, Chapter 13,

and the State Plan,submitted to the Federal Government,indicating compliance
with Part "B" of the Education of the Handicapped Act. These documents
state that the local school district has the first line of responsibility
for providing a free public education for all students.
