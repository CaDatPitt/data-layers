Dear Govenor Shapp.

I have visited Polk State school and I know some of the

emp1oyeee_of the school. I have never heard anything but praise

for the type or treatment and concern that Dr, Moclelland shove each
and every oatient in his care. Iem sure it means a great deal to a
retarded nernon to be treated as a nerson, and as a person with

a name, not as an inaminate object.

I have served on the board of Easter Seal with Dr, Meclelland
and haxe found him c:noer4ed for the welfare of all those he
comes in contact with.

As a lifelong resiient of Venango County, I know that Dr,
%o3leLland has constantly tried to expose patients to the
communityand the community to them through such orojects as the
music gr>uos at Polk STate School, in working out a program with
Venango County Vocational Teohinal School , eﬁeouramed orograma
and blrcaday parties out an by vn:&ou3 charehes‘and civic groups
who mingle with the oatlents at the School. The annual circus day
hos always been lozkod forward to bv those cared for by Polk
State School and by the employees there as they know how much it
me us to the catienbs. Dr. ﬁcclelland worked hard to retain
the farm at the school. as he felt the farm experience

-‘\

oeneiitted 8* many oz those in his care.

I believe that a school and hosoital as large as Folk needs
an exceotinnal sunevintendant. I also celieve this job should
be above oalitioe. I do not know Mrs. wohlgemuth'e nor Mrs. Elk1n's
training nor quallficatﬁons for Judging Dr. Moclelland, but I do
protest what I believe to be the unjust and undeserved firing.
of a qualified doctor of the highest_l tegrlty and finest principals
who has devoted years of concerned treatment to those in his care.

‘ Sincerely « *
