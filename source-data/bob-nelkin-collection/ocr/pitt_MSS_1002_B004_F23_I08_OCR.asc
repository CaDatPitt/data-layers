U.S. mental health care:

Animal, Vegetable or Human Being?

By JOHN WILPERS
Associate Editor

Highlights:

1—Mental illness is the Nation's largest and most costly
health problem. One person out of 10 will be afflicted. Costs
run beyond $20 billion a year.

2—Treatment varies from that which is reminiscent of the
Dark Ages to forms showing prescience of the Twenty-first

Century.

3—Mental hospitals are still largely custodial while shif-
ting orientation toward short-term, professional treatment.

WE USED TO burn “them." In
moments of greater enlightenment, we pro-
tected ourselves from them by shipping
them off to a backwoods fortress. Here, the
gates were slammed shut, the windows bar-
red, the doors locked and the keys thrown
away. Inside, every possible effort was
taken, including the use of chains, whips
and cages, to guarantee that “they” would
never return to plague society again.

Today, the burning is considered bar-
baric, as are the visible whips and chains.
But the fortresses are still with us. So are
the bars, the locks, the cages and worst of
all, many of the fears and uncertainties
tint caused those fortresses to be built and
the doors locked in the ﬁrst place. And be-
yond that, 20th Century America, in all of
its sophistication, now substitutes subtle
social chains for the wrought iron of the
past.

What possible illness exists that would
make a “civilized” people draw back and
repel some of its own in such a fashion,
that elicits on some occasions sympathy
and warmth but on others laughter, rejec-
tion that brands its victims with a social
sible that there still exists a human condi-
tion, that brands its victims with a social
stigma whether they seek treatment or not,
that brands them even if that treatment is
successful?

Such a condition is mental illness. Long
a mystery to mankind, its spiritual and
psychic nature does not lend itself to an
easy, empirical, and practically fool-proof
type of diagnosis and treatment. No X-
rays are available to provide undeniable
proof of a speciﬁc mental malady. Invisi-
bility in cause, coupled with varying de-
grees of visibility in socially aberrant be-
havior, makes mental illness for the aver-
age citizen confusing at best, fearful and
destructive at worst.

Factors ranging from the physiological
through the genetic and the psychological
to the environmental all contribute to the
onset of various forms of mental illness in-

cluding schizophrenia, depression, other
psychoses, neuroses, character disorders
and psychosomatic ailments. Each is a sp-
ecial kind of hell for its victims—a world
where they are often alone to suffer.

While the immediate cause—and-effect
process of most physical ailments is absent,
the need for professional treatment in both
cases is paramount. Telling someone with
an emotional problem to “snap out of it”
without psychiatric help is like telling
someone with appendicitis to simply forget
about it. Mental illness can be cured, but
only with the proper treatment.

Man’s search for the “proper treatment”
is a history of puzzlement, superstition,
fear, violence, reason and compassion
whose written record alone dates back to
the dawn of antiquity. The oldest written
prescription on record-—an Egyptian pa-
pyrus——advises a mental patient to wear a
green stone to ward off hysteria. Plato ad-
vocated in the 4th Century B.C. that the
mentally ill were not responsible for their
acts and therefore should not be treated as
criminals but instead given humane care in
the community.

A History of Suffering

But the tone for treatment for nearly
2,000 years was unknowingly Verbalized
by a First Century Roman scholar, Celsus,
when he advised that when a patient “has
said or done anything wrong, he must be
chastised by hunger, chains and fetters." In
tint tradition, human beings were subjec-
ted to a myriad of misguided, often cruel
and sadistic treatment ranging from public
display, supernatural rites and “magic”
potions, to lifelong imprisonment, beat-
ings, torture and even death

From 1408, the year of the construction
of the first “insane” asylum, until the
present, the most common treatment of the
mentally ill has been placement in asylums
or hospitals. “Hospitals” is a cruel word to
use, for it implies rehabilitation and his-
torically there has been little of that.

“Treatment,” for the lucky, was restricted
to being locked up.

Gradually, though, voices began to cry
out for a more humane approach. Among
them were Dr. Benjamin Rush, Dr. Phillipe
Pine] and Dorthea Dix, whose efforts
brought such things as occupational thera-
py, psychiatry, decent quarters and hu-
mane treatment into the mental hospitals.

Today the search goes on. The mental
health ﬁeld is probably unique in that it is
possible to receive treatment reminiscent
of the Dark Ages and also prescient of the
21st Century. In the United States today
there are patients, totally naked, locked up
in barren, unlit, unsanitary cages, condi-
tions which even zoo keepers would de-
plore, and there are other patients living
normal productive lives in society, tlmnks
to the miracle of modern chemistry.

The current U.S. mental health problem
is not a small one. One person out of every
10, or well over 20 million people, will
suffer from a mental or emotional problem
that could beneﬁt from professional help.
On any given day, 37% of all U.S. hospital
beds are occupied by mentally ill persons.

Mental illness is also America’s most
costly health problem, annually running in
excess of $20 billion due to such factors as
absenteeism, inefﬁciency and turnover, ac-
cidents, alcoholism, physical ailments and
treatment costs. Business authorities con-
servatively estimate the loss to industry at
$10 billion a year. Cost of direct treatment
is nearly $4 billion a year—-65% of which
is borne by governmental agencies.

Governmental efforts, on the Federal,
state and county levels, to provide relief
and rehabilitation to the mentally ill have
been concentrated in two areas: the largely
infamous mental hospitals and the ﬂedg-
ling community mental health centers
(CMHC). .

The public mental hospital: The word
“stigma” pales before what has become
common public folklore surrounding men-
tal institutions. Historically located in
isolated areas either far from man or sur-
rounded by his waste and unwanted, asy-
lums lent themselves to myth and mystery.
With distance, walls, gates, bars, locks and
guards between the public and the patient,
understanding was difﬁcult, tall tales and
nervous jokes easy, and fear, scorn and
hate inveitable.

But while some of the causes of such
feelings are as tangible and contemporary
as the bricks that still make up the fortress
walls, they are also deteriorating, although
in some cases no faster than the bricks
themselves.

Years and years of the “lock” ‘em up,

throw away the key” philosophy has left a
legacy of hundreds of massive struc-
tures—-the most visible and archaic com-
ponent of contemporary mental health
treatment. Many are over 100 years old;
many are not but appear so.

Such structures, built with one idea of
“treatment” in mind, do not easily lend
themselves to improvement and transition
to a new mode of care. The costs of such
change are high but in most states costs are
a moot point when the desire is lacking.
The limited upkeep that is generally pro-
vided can not even remotely be expected to
cope with the ravages of time. And so,
many hospitals, and the patients within
them, deteriorate.

Four images are presented by today’s
mental institutions: the custodial or ware-
house image; the prison image; the zoo
image; and most recently but least com-
mon, the therapeutic community image.
Numerically the majority fall within the
custodial category.

Human Warehouses

The custodial image, evoking row after
row of identical beds, inches apart with as
many as 40 or 50 to a “room,” has long
since become a reality. Warehoused items
require no privacy and lines of toilets with
no doors or even dividers, make no pre-
tense of providing it. A patient’s every
move and possession is public knowledge.
Treatment may occur but it is rarely indi-
vidualized, usually recreational and always
drugged.

But the clincher is the warehoused them-
selves—standing, sitting, lying, perhaps
walking around, but all without a purpose,
all just living out another day. No different
from yesterday, no different from tomor-
row.

When the passage from one ward to an-
other is interrupted by the unlocking of a
“door,” when the view out a window is dis-
torted by thick, iron bars, and when the en-
trance to the facility is limited to a single
armed-guarded interruption of a wall, the
prison “image” loses its academic irrelev-
ance. Even the patients tend to look like
prisoners with their bodies draped in ill-ﬁt-
ing, dull-colored uniforms.

Chronologically, ‘the Dark Ages ended
almost 1,000 years ago. But today, for
those who so desire, and for the patients
who have no choice, it is as available, real
and ugly as if it were still 900 A.D. Today,
in certain isolated wards across the coun-
try, human beings are literallygaggg, The
whole world for some mental patﬁmts is a
single, unpainted concrete cubicle, unlit
and totally unfurnished, its uniformity
broken only by gutters designed to carry
off human wastes. Naked and ignored, they
stare out with empty eyes from behind an
iron mesh door—a door which for them
will probably open only one more time.

In the adjoining hallway, their less sev-
erely disturbed fellow inmates, also in vari-
ous degrees of undress, pad from similar
cells to a large empty concrete room to do

46

the same thing—-wait. Their only distrac-
tion comes from walking in endless circles,
rocking in a chair or simply falling asleep
on the cold concrete ﬂoor.

A Future of Hope

Other inmates pass their days in less sev-
ere but no more humane surroundings.
There are no niceties such as curtains, rugs
or bedspreads. Walls and ﬂoors are made
of tile and linoleum, characteristic of most
hospitals, making the cleaning of ﬁlth eas-
ier than its prevention. Fire and safety
hazards are many, precautions and emer-
gency capabilities few. There is an eve-
present, and sometimes overpowering
stench of human waste.

The extremes, however, are disappear-
ing. In their place, at the opposite end of
the treatment spectrum, are a few select
hospitals of the treatment image. The phys-
ical difference alone is immediately appar-
ent: paint is fresh; furniture new; rugs soft-
en the ﬂoors; bedspreads, curtains and in-
dividual armoires try to imitate home;
large dormitory rooms are divided into
semi-private compartments; partitions
bring privacy to the bathrooms; barless
windows and unlocked doors bring the
outside closer; uniforms for both patients
and staff are banned. A choice few even
have air conditioning and cafe-style meal
areas.

But physical surroundings are not the
most critical factor, although they in them-
selves can act as an aid, instead of a hind-
rance, to rehabilitation. What puts light
years between the zoo and the therapeutic
hospital is treatment. Where there was
brutality and neglect, there is now concern
and active therapy. Such hospitals, whose
physical facilities resemble the therapeutic,
custodial or even prison image, might have
any number of treatment attributes.

Such select institutions are organized in-
to geographical units, wards whose pa-
tients are chosen on the basis of their place
of residence as opposed to their diagnosis
or longevity of stay. Each’ unit has a team
of professionals——psychiatrists, psycholog-
ists, social workers, occupational thera-
pists, registered nurses and others—who
are totally responsible for that unit's pa-
tients from the moment they walk in the
door to the time that they leave——and pos-
sibly even after.

The unit usually receives prior notiﬁca-
tion of a patient’s arrival from his CMI-IC
and is briefed as to his condition. The pa-
tient then meets with the unit team to de-
lineate problems and decide on a course of
action. An individualized treatment plan is
formulated and one member of the team is
designated the primary therapist—an indi-
vidual whose one-to-one relationship with
the patient guarantees that the patient will
never be “lost” and has one speciﬁc indi-
vidual responsible for his progress.

During treatment, every patient is re-
viewed at least once a week during the unit
team’s daily meeting. Such meetings insure
not only patient review but also team com-
munication and coordination.

The most common forms of treatment
provided include various forms of group
therapy, individual therapy, chemo- or
drug therapy, vocational rehabilitation,
occupational therapy and industrial or
work therapy. Chemotherapy is common, a
necessary step to eliminate violent be-
havior or certain distractions and allow the
other therapy modes to have an eﬁ°ect. A
therapeutic milieu also relies heavily on
patients helping one another and the blur-
ring of distinct staff roles.

A Treatment smorgasbord

More speciﬁc treatment modes include
music, art and recreational therapy, educa-
tional classes, behavior modiﬁciation ac-
tivities, physical therapy, electroconvulsive
therapy, activities in daily living and
homernaking, remotivation therapy, anti-
depression therapy, self-government meet-
ings, ﬁeld trips, reality orientation and
readjustment therapy. Sometimes a pa-
tient’s family is also involved.

Alcoholic treatment units are housed in
separate, homelike structures complete
with private and semi-private rooms, self-
government and rigorous, emotional group
therapy sessions often throbbing with the
fervor and commitment of a revival.

Then, after an average stay of 4 to 8
weeks, the patient is sent back to his com-
munity. This potentially painful, awkward
change is eased by the hospital’s division of
transitional services that aids in job place-
ment, family counseling, appointment-
making with a CMHC, location in a half-
way house or nursing home, the provision
of outpatient services, transportation, and
general follow-up, all designed to make
sure that the former patient never becomes
a patient again.

No one hospital has all of the above
traits, but their growing acceptance and
the burgeoning use of the CMHCs and
psychiatric wards of general hospitals has
brought about a radical change. In 1955,
when the resident population in public
mental hospitals stood at its peak of
559,000, the then-current growth rate
would have resulted in almost one million
residents by 1973. Instead, today’s pop-
ulation ms plummeted to approximately
275,000, with end-of-century predictions
running around 50,000.

The dogged determination of many
hospital administrators to clean
house—preventing those who do not be-
long in mental hospitals from being admit-
ted and eliminating that type already in the
hospital—and an equally dogged, though
less successful effort ot “treat and return”

--have been major factors in the popula-
tion decline.

But at the same time admissions have in-
creased dramatically—ll2% since 1956.
In 1971 alone there were 407,640 admis-
sions. The apparent discrepancy is ex-
plained by the fact that while the unquali-
ﬁed are being weeded out, those that need
help are coming in increasing numbers, re-
ceiving treatment and going home. It is es-

timated that almost 90% of current admis-
sions leave the hospital within a year.

That, however, though itself not the
ideal, is the best side of mental health
treatment. Most of the 275,000 resident
patients exist in the world of limited treat-
ment, custody and neglect.

Many such facilities utilize the “cot-
tage” system—a series of large, dormitory-
like buildings and “cottages” in name
only. Not only are there no daily meetings
or patient reviews, there are no units and
no teans. If a patient isn’t released from
the admissions ward, he runs the very real
risk of making an endless odyssey through
the back wards of the hospital.

“Treatment” limps along on the crut-
ches of the psychoactive drugs often used
for the convenience of the staff and as a
subsitute for nonexistent programs.

Industrial therapy, frequently a euphem-
ism for slave or cheap labor, serves the
purposes of lowering the hospital payroll,
maintaining its daily operations, occupy-
ing the patient’s time and, in some cases,
providing valuable work experience. Many
patients are not paid, others receive a pit-
tance and few get the minimum wage. Oc-
cupational therapy varies in effectiveness
from a creative workshop where the mind
is activated and observed, to a production
line assembly of potholders, ashtrays and
sentimental ceramics whose aging molds
have dulled the minds of many a patient.

Contemporary Limbo

Periodic group and individual therapy is
available in the admission cottage but
might just as well not have been invented
for the inmates of the stagnant backwards.

Generally skeletal and strictly custodial
staffs, and a subsequent and increasing de-
pendence on drugs, provide the basic
materials for a classic scenario of a mental
ward: glassy-eyed patients asleep or
slouching in chairs; a TV, the hospital’s
cheapest therapist,blaring away with dis-
torted sound and picture; and a white-clad
staff, protected in a nursing station, drink-
ing coffee and trading gossip. Children and
adults alike, some mentally retarded and
inappropriately committed, are ignored,
the improvement of their minds and
maladies left strictly to chance.

Release of “escape” can be as speedy as
the drugs and the treatment will allow, or
as slow as death Even with a department
of transitional services, hospitals labor un-
der their age-old function of social dump-
ing ground. The placement of patients,
many’ of whom have become institutional-
ized, and possess no skills, money, family,
home or friends, into communities with no
desire for them or resources to lnndle them
is difficult and too often impossible.

A major contributor to the problem is
stafﬁng. Quality professionals are kept
away by meager salaries and unattractive
localities. In 1970, publicly employed cer-
tiﬁed staff psychiatrists started at $15,000
and peaked at $33,000 while their private
counterparts could easily gross $50,000.

MAY 1973

The average ratio of professional, treat-
ment-type personnel to patients ranges
from three to 33 per 100, but these are
mostly therapists and counselors. The psy-
chiatrist ratio peaks at nine per 100 and
bottoms out at one per l,000. But even if
dollars were available and salaries com-
petitive, the supply of professionals doesn't
even begin to equal the need.

Over half of the total staff time is pro-
vided by nursing and attendant personnel,
of which nine-tenths is strictly custodial.
Thirty-six percent is provided by non-pro-
fessional staff and 12% by professionals.

But actual treatment is not restricted to
professionals. The subtle and not-so-subtle
effects of 24-hour contact with untrained,
uneducated, underpaid and largely unmo-
tivated aides and attendants can be stifling
if not cruel and destructive. Such is not the
case across the board, but barely subsist-
ence salaries tend to draw only barely
qualiﬁed people.

Many innovative administrators and
professionals have seen their ideas subjec-
ted to tactics ranging from “ignore, delay
and forget” to actual mutiny. In many
cases the attendant custodial staff has no
more than an eighth-grade education, is
“salaried” within a few hundred dollars of
the poverty level, received no training and
upon death or retirement will hand the job
down to their offspring. Psychiatrists and
administrators rmy come and go, but the
custodial staff is as permanent and as
threatened by change as the buildings
themselves.

In the end it all comes down to money
and desire. Almost without exception, the
people saddled with administering the
mental hospitals and providing treatment
therein are extremely dedicated and doing
their best to win a modern complex war
with sticks and stones.

In 1970, maintenance expenditures for
in-patient services of state and county
mental hospitals were nearly $1.9 bil-
lion—an impressive ﬁgure until translated
into the national average daily mainten-
ance expenditure per patient of $14.89.
Can miraculous or even satisfactory results
be expected when a hospital is allowed a
mere $15 a day per patient to provide
salaries for administrators, psychiatrists,
occupational therapists, social workers,
nurses, attendants, secretaries and main-
tenance men, as well as for the costs of
therapeutic programs, medicine, general
health care, food, clothing, treatment sup-
plies, equipment, ordinary repairs and
overhead?

It must be noted that from 1966 to
1970, the national average expenditure per
patient did increase by 93%, and 15 states
increased their expenditure by 100 to
200%. But such action could be repeated
tomorrow and some patients would still be
left in the Dark Ages. In l970, Veterans
Administration psychiatric hospitals spent
over $30 and private psychiatric hospitals
over $48 per patient per day. Not even one
state matched the private ﬁgure and only

three equalled or exceeded the VA ﬁgure.
Over half the states could triple their ex-
penditure and still not equal the private
ﬁgure.

But arbitrary ﬁgures are meaningless
until translated into actual services or lack
thereof. The resulting and often appalling
discrepancies have given rise to a number
of questions concerning equal protection
under the law and an individual's right to
treatment.

The most signiﬁcant case, and one with
potentially national repercussions, is an
Alabama lawsuit—Wyatt v. Stickney. For
the first time in history, persons involun-
tarily conﬁned in institutions for the men-
tally ill or retarded were held to have a
constitutional right to adequate treatment
and rehabilitation. But the court did not
stop at that.

The judge also stipulated a speciﬁc, de-
tailed set of standards and procedures for
implementation. The order includes stan-
dards on patient labor, physical and psy-
chological environment, nutrition, patient
evaluation, treatment plans, stafﬁng pat-
terns and transitional care.

The case is currently under appeal in
conjunction with a similar Georgia case
whose results were diametrically opposed.
Suits of similar nature and threats of suits
are being used to pressure legislators and
administrators, who like to avoid legal ac-
tion and publicity, to bring about the long
overdue changes without court action. Lit-
igation, however, due to the intransigence
of many state legislatures appears to be the
tactic for future reform.

In the ﬁnal analysis, the ﬁnger of blame
can never be pointed in the direction of the
untrained attendants, the overworked
staff, or the politically sensitive legislators.
It must always point back at society in
general. The quality of mental health treat-
ment and the money allocated by the legis-
latures only reflects the degree of impor-
tance which society attaches to the care of
the less fortunate. In some states that con-
cern is genuine and deep; in others it could
be mistaken for apathy or outright cruelty.

Past reforms have slowly brought mental
health treatment out of the superstitious
and violent world of the Dark Ages to-
wards the civilized professional level of
treatment designed to achieve the ultimate
goal—a cure. But there are still many who
have been left behind and in the hot and
cold rush towards the future, these indi-
viduals and their virtual prisons must not
be forgotten but changed and included in
the modern mental health treatment spec-
trum.
