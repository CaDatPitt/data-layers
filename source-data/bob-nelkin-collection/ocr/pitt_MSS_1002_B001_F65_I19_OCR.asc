Dear sir:

I have read with great interest newspaper accounts of your inr
vestigation of Laurel Rouse in Fayette County and Allegheny
Valley school in Pittsburgh. 1 note that both have in couaon
the fact that they are private, non-profit facilities. May I
take the liberty of suggesting another worthwhile area of.
investigation?

You should specifically investigate and audit private. profit-
naking interim care facilities subsidised by the Departnnt of
welfare. Interim care facilities are facilities. such as
Allegheny Valley School, that house mentally retarded individuals
who are waiting assignment to state schools and hospitals.

our organisation has recently had stat! ad volunteers to three
such private, proprietary facilities. Two are located in the
eastern part of the state and one in the west. All had glaring
deficiencies in either plant. sanitation or program.

Per diam rates for the facilities ranged from $11.50 to nearly
$15.00 a day. on this amount, in theory. residents are to be
provided program. housing, clothing and food. By way of \
comparison, day programs conducted by this organisation cost .
$8.00 per diee. It would appear to be impossible for the

entrepreneurs that run these proprietary facilities to provi e
a program for less than $8.00 which would leave $3.00 to $7. 0
a day for food and shelter and a profit. â€˜
