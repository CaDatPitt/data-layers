O'Connor - who is running the show, the staff or the superintendent?

Calloway - there are ways to make staff work and there are ways
not to make staff work.

Calloway - we met without the superintendent in case they (the
union) wanted to talk about the administration. They did not
speak about Dr. Scott in the formal meeting.

Mrs. Calloway implied that she or Harrisburg was critical
of Dr. Scott.

Meyers - Ruth Scott has been appointed the Acting Superintendent,
with no intention of seeking a replacement at this time. That
is the DPW policy for any state school and hospital appointment.

galloway - on the matter of communications, this place will have
to improve. We opened up the lines of communication today. Part
of the creditability problem was with the regional office.

Calloway - on the implementation, Scott will send me a plan this
week and the staff training will begin next.

Meyers - questioned about the need for a consultant who can fre-
quently visit Western State and the various shifts so there
would be no problem getting a consultant in Pittsburgh, if we
can locate one.

In attendance at the meeting, DPW - Anna Belle Calloway,
Deputy Secretary, Stanley Meyers, Deputy Secretary, Larry
Jenkins, Deputy Commissioner of MR, (not attending, Ruth Scott,
Acting Superintendent), Jerry O'Connor, Chairman, CPLAC, Gloria
Mitchell, President, Westmoreland County ARC, Steve O'Donnell,
Executive Director, Westmoreland County ARC, Ellen Siciliano,
ACC Board Member, Marlene Burda, Chairman, Residential Care
Committee, PARC, Angela zondus, President, WSSH Trustees, Bob
Nelkin, Associate Executive Director, ACC.

The meeting went on for a couple of hours. Members of
citizensâ€™ organizations strongly criticized the union and the
Department of Public Welfare for coming up with a non-solution.
The discussion was heated at times. The remarks quoted above
are only fragments of the total discussion.
