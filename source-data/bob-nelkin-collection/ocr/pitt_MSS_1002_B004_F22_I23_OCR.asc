Madam Secretary: I ' ~»vé
Your recent statement to remove Dr. Mcclelland as Superintendent

of Polk State School was without a coubt the most ignorant,
irresponsible and stupid move ever made by an official of this

‘State.

Dr. Mcclelland has served Polk State School for over twenty (20)'
years and has dedicated his life to that school and the people
who reside there. To claim that he has allowed cruelty to exist
in the school is totally unfounded. One visit to the school

and you can make the decision to fire him!! My are't we smartii

Why haven't you been there before? Why don't you spend a week

_or a month with these people? Why don't you talk to the parents

who have children in the school? Then you can make your decision
and I'm sure it will not be the same — or is there political
motivationtt

Sincerely,

x"./""’( / ' 1,./II! / “‘:..~.:—~/\ .1",
