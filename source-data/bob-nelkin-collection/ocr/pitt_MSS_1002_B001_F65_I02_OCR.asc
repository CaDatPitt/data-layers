History:
In June of 1972, concerned that the Department of Public Welfare

was not adequately serving the retarded under their jurisdiction,
ACC-PARC's Board of Directors“charged its State School and Hospital

and Interim Care Committee to re-activate visitations to MR facilities
in the western region. The death of Richard‘Hissim at Ridge View Center
prompted several on-site inspections of this facility...with requests

to DPW after each visitation that the facility be closed. These re-

quests were ignored. The death of Louis Novak at Ridge View reinforced

\
\

‘the local chapter's fears for the care of Allegheny County residents

placed in.facilities throughout the State...and a public pledge was
made in August to monitor all facilities housing mentally retarded

children and adults from Allegheny County.

Mrs. Thornburgh visited the following facilities thatﬁhave recently

been in the news: Ridge View, Mountain Top, Polk.
