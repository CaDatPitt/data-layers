SENATE BILL 94

Last week SB 94 (residence zoning for homes for the handicapped) passed the House by a
vote of 113 to 80. Attached you wi11 find a copy of the House R011 Ca11 on this Bi11.
P1ease note how your representative(s) voted on this important Bi11. Letters of thanks
shou1d be issued to a11 1egis1ators who supported this Bi11 from your area. Legis1ators
who were opposed must be re-educated on the need for community programs and services for
menta11y retarded citizens.

The fight is not over yet. The Bi11 wi11 go to a conference committee to work out the
detai1s and to be c1eaned up. As of this writing, we do not have a 1ist of the members
of that Committee but as soon as we get their names, we wi11 pass them on to you as your
1egis1ators in both the House and Senate wi11 need to be informed that PARC supports this
Bi11 with the fo11owing de1etions: (1) "and providing for payments in 1ieu of taxation”;
(2) "The municipa1ity may require that a11 the occupants of the comunity residentia1

faci1ity sha11 be residents of that municipa1ity or a municipa1ity immediate1v contiguous
thereto.” PARC a1so supports the inc1usion of menta11y disab1ed persons under this B111.

This is an important Bi11, so p1ease contact your 1egis1ator(s) and urge them to revise
and pass this B111. Any 1etter sent to any 1egis1ator shou1d be carboned to this state
office so that we may have a record of which representatives have been contacted.

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

E11en Sici1iano, Chairman of PARC's State Education Committee, has indicated that her
Committee endorses the Governor's Budget for Specia1 Education as the minimum acceptab1e
fisca1 a11ocation necessary to meet the needs of specia1 education students for the
coming schoo1 year. Mrs. Sici1iano urges each 1oca1 chapter to contact their 1egis1ators
and support the fo11owing 1ine items for specia1 education.

ITEM 1977-78 1978-79

Specia1 Education $ 98,528,000 $109,379,000
Pupi1 Transportation 78,000,000 106,680,000
Authority Renta1s & Sinking Fund 147,000,000 170,200,000
State Schoo1s & Hospita1s - Education 9,500,000 16,400,000

Appropriation #15 (State Schoo1s & Hospita1s -- Education) is a key item in this year's
budget request. The reason for the 1arge increase over 1ast year is due to the fact that
private 1icensed faci1ities (interim care) and HoodhaveiCenter wi11 now be ab1e to receive
payment out of this 1ine item for the studentsin those faci1ities rather than from the
Genera1 A11ocation. To meet the intent and spirit of both state and federa1 1aw and a1so
to meet the educationa1 needs of our menta11y retarded citizens, we need your support in
getting the Governor's Budget request for specia1 education passed.

Mrs. Pat Hametz, Chairman of the PARC State Residentia1 Services Committee, has indicated
that her Committee supports the Governor's Budget for this item. She urges a11 our 1oca1s

to support all the items in the welfare Budget that will help the mentally retarded
citizen. Specific attention should be focused on the CLA Budget for this coming year,
which is $30,129,000. The Budget for this item in 1977-78 was $22,022,000. we need the
full amount for CLA's in order to provide the community living arrangement program with
an adequate budget to serve our people in the community. Judge Broderick's Order along
with our state's commitment to serve mentally retarded citizens in the community should
be used as justification for support of this Budget.

The Base Allocation proposed for 1978-79 is $105,849,000. This is up from $99,456,000 in
1977-78. we are hard pressed to defend this figure compared to other figures because

we lack substantial data from the Office of Mental Retardation. However, if your county
does not have the appropriate community services available and if your county administrator
is crying lack of funds, we can only stress that your local representative should be made
aware of that.

The Institutional Budget for both Mental Health and Mental Retardation is a total of
$342,495,000. The Budget for Mental Retardation amounts to $241,761,000 of which only
$129,966,000 is from state dollars. It is also important to note that approximately
$8,500,000 has been moved from the Mental Health Budget to the Mental Retardation Budget
for residents at Embreeville. Because no additional residents will be admitted or served,
this amounts to approximately a seven million dollar reduction in total state funds
allocated for mentally retarded persons in state institutions. Your support of this
Institutional Budget, particularly in view of the fact that union contracts will be
re-negotiated at mid-year 1978, is specifically requested.

Your personal and on-going communication with your local representative will insure the
passage of this Budget. we urge you to Contact your representatives and let them know

of your support. Please, carbon the state PARC Office on any letter sent to representatives
so we will be aware of who has been contacted.

SENATE BILL 979

Further testimony on SB 979 (new printer's #1561) was presented, by PARC and 14 other
entities, before the Senate Health and welfare Committee (Senator Coppersmith presiding)
on March 21st in Harrisburg. President Teddi Leiden presented testimony on behalf of
PARC and Elsie Schmidt, Chairman of the PARC State Governmental Affairs Committee, was in
attendance. (copy of testimony presented attached)

The testimony includes further recommendations to streamline the Act and facilitate its
subsequent implementation on a county leve1,adding to section 304 one more criteria for
a waiver of judicial procedure providing the facility houses eight persons or less.

The testimony presented on March 21st for the most part supports the provisions included
in S8 979. we urge your support of Senator Coppersmith in his endeavor to convince the
other Senators that SB 979 is indeed important and should be passed in the near future.
