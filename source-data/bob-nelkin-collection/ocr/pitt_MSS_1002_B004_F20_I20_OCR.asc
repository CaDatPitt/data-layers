In view of the circumstances surrounding Dr. McClelland's dismissal
~as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital by Mrs. Helene Nobl-
. gemuth, Secretary of Public Welfare, I an compelled by reason and conscience
‘ . to write to you on his behalf.

Over the past twenty years Dr. McClelland has built a solid foundation
.of faithful service both as a Physician and Administrator. He is a man of
integrity, dedication, wisdom and strength. His guiding influence has enabled
the staff at Polk to overcome many hardships created by a lack of resources
~and has.transcended the attitude of special interest.organizations who have
come to criticize but not to help him in his efforts to provide better care
for the mentally retarded. To condemn Dr. McClelland, to deny him justice
and dignity, kindness and compassion only expresses ironically the dismal
failure of Helene Wohlgemuth and the P.A.R.C.

, -.-.... ._.-- —....._ -._......_ ..

ADr. McClelland's willingness to improve conditions for the residents at
Polk, to implement workable and-realistic programs, to create a home of love
and dignity, to provide lasting and constructive change can be readily demon~
strated. All one has to do is take the time to fully investigate. Yes, it is
true that Polk could be a better institution for the retarded; however, is V
Dr. McClelland to blame for the legislature denying'adequate funds that wculd
result in better programming and care for the retarded. Someday all reasonable
citizens will recognize that Dr. McClelland was not only a capable Superinten-
adent but a father to the residents at Polk He knew most of then by name)
a-friend to the employes, and most assuredly, a man of-reason and compassion.

_.._... .,__.

. _ It is for these reasons that I respectfully request that Dr. James H.
' ‘ - McClelland, Jr. be reinstated as Superintendent of Polk State School and

‘ Hospital. As'for the P.A.R.C. I can only pray, "God forgive them for they
know not what they do." ‘

. . . . Sincerely,
