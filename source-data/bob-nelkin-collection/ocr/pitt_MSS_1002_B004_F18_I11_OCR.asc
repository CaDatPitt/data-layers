My dear Governor:

The Pennsylvania Medical Society urges you to call for a
study funded through the legislature to bring together a num-
ber of now uncoordinated studies of the Mental Health/Mental
Retardation Program in Pennsylvania as a step toward a single,
thorough, objective evaluation of the entire situation. Our
Society pledges its cooperation in such an effort.

The state administration and legislature should partici-
pate in, but not dominate, a general investigation led by a
national figure with an unquestioned reputation for objectivity.
As additional participants we suggest representatives of the
general public, private mental health and mental retardation
groups and leading professionals in the mental health/mental
retardation fields. -

The information currently available to us indicates
that Dr. James H. Mcclelland, the former superintendent of
Polk State Hospital, is a victim of the state's difficulty in
establishing and administering practical uniform guidelines
with adequate funding in the mental health/mental retardation
area. In addition, the emotionalism surrounding the dismissal
of Dr. Mcclelland tends to obscure the real issue -- the
quality of all of the care and services provided by the state

to the mentally ill and mentally retarded. The general investi-
gation we recommend should be authorized promptly under auspices
that would avoid any political stigma. Political or personality
issues dare not be involved in anything so serious as assessing
the quality of care and services provided to the retarded and
mentally ill.

The issue is not the use of restraining enclosures for those
patients whose periodic violence to themselves and to others can-
not be controlled adequately by drugs. The real issue is the
total quality of care the state provides and this needs to be
impartially assessed and made public so that facts and not
emotionalism will be the basis for action.

The general study we recommend is sorely needed and we call
upon State Government to authorize it as promptly as possible.
We pledge our support for such a move and our willingness to parti-
cipate in it.

Sincerely yours,

Robert S. Sanford,.
