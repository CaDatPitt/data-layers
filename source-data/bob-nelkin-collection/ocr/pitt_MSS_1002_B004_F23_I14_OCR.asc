Editorial #22 - Dr. McClelland's Firing

And now, speaking for WWSW Radio is Charles H. Warner, Executive Vice
President and General Manager, with an editorial opinion ...

"The caging of patients at the Polk State Mental Hospital in
Venango County seemed to come as a shock to State welfare ;
Secretary, Helene Wohlgemuth, on a surprise visit to the
institution last week. The incident led to the immediate
dismissal of Polk's Superintendent, James Mcclelland. WWSW
feels that such a reaction may have been too hasty, and that
such decisions need to be based on more reasoned and qualified
scientific investigation. After all, Ms. Wohlgemuth herself
told WWSW news in a recent interview that she was not a Psy-
chologist and unsure of the best way to handle patients who
are given to violent outbursts that could be harmful to them-
selves or others around them. We are sure people would like
.to think that there are better ways of handling such cases,
but just how is a decision for trained mental health Psy-
chologists to make.

Earlier this week Edward Goldman, who heads the office of
Mental Retardation in the Welfare Department disclosed that

he had visited Polk six months ago and seen the cages, and
that he relayed his findings to Ms. Wohlgemuth. However, she
denies any knowledge of such a report. Meanwhile, Dr.
Mcclelland has stated that the cages have been used for nearly
15 years and that hundreds of people including state officials
saw them. V

WWSW endorses plans for a Senate Subcommittee investigation of

. the conditions at Polk, but until the announced probe is com-
pleted it seems only fair to rescind the firing order and put
Dr. Mcclelland on a temporary suspension instead ... and while
we're addressing the issue of investigations... how about one
into the communications in the Welfare Department."

Responsible people with opposite points of view will be given the

opportunity to express their opinions on WWSW.
