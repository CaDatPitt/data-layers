Dear Secretary Wohlgemuth: /

The imediate dismissal of Dr. James H. Mcclelland, Super-
intendent of Polk State School and Hospital, and the manner and
wording given as reasons for his release are not justified or
applicable to a dedicated administrator and community leader.

The Franklin Area Chamber of Comerce is concerned as-to
the treatment of the patients and also realizes that the variety
of patients under care cannot be equally supervised.

We are certain Dr. Mcclelland would conform to whatever new
policy or criteria that would be established for unusual patients;

thus eliminating the necessity for the abrupt and provocative dis-
missal. -

While the Chamber takes no issue in dismissal of personnel
from time to time, we believe this move was unjust and lacked
consideration.

Sincerely,
WT m 
A. T. McClure, President
