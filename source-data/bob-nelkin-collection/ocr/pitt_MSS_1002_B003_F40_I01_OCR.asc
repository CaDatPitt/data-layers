Sir:

Something has to be done about the help at Spruce Lodge Total
Care Unit at Wstern State School and Hospital in Canonsburg and done

;at once. On the thyee to eleven shift, I_§}nd only two glyle ﬁgklgg!
‘ -ciu“~e one term ¢ar9,.2§.§1§n*§»$ andocno~.eone car the worms (I~Iar:2'. ..

c:)“I§‘i-“a?£5i~’€fé”d End is notcapame of giving them the care that is
needed. Even though Mary 3 a nice person and she tries hard she has ‘
put a rectal thermometer in a child 3 month who can bite and does not
realize the danger involved. This is sheer negligence o the part of
the authorities at western State School and Hospital and action must
be taken immediately.

I also aec these children are back to laying on the finer or

in bed all day without any attention fromlanyone except the little the
attenéants are able to give them. There is trained personnel who are
very good with these beautiful children, but, I supwosa the new director
feels it is wasted on the total care. ue11-1 disagree, and if need

be I will call every open discussion program.I can 333 also write a
letter to the editor of our local paper. _

Your imediate attention to this crucial yroblem is requested.
I Respectfully,
Joy'Gafforin1
