Dear ﬁrs. Calloway:

Although our association has not been totally
satisfied with the quality of Polk Dispersal programs,
we are pleased with the number of people who have been
able to leave Polk and move to smaller facilities in
the community.

 

Ii  .2 .~;_ g:

We are concerned that there has been a lull in
the planning for additional movements of people from
Polk to the comunity.

  

1) Do you plan additional movements of people
from Polk to the community?

2) If so. then what are your most immediate plans?

3) How will citizens and advocates be involved in
this planning?

our association will continue to support dispersal
of people from over populated institutions and to support
the development of creative and more effective programs
in the counmnity.

sincerely.

Robert Nelkin .
Associate xxecutive Director
