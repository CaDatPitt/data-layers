The Community Living Arrangements Program was initiated in l97l—72

community setting and to prepare them for independent or family living. The
OLA Program provides nine different types of community based residential ser-
vices as alternatives to institutionalization for the mentally retarded citizen.
Several CLA's serve specific target groups, such as children, youth, and adults.
Other types are based on medical, correctional, behavioral shaping, and respite‘
care modes.
