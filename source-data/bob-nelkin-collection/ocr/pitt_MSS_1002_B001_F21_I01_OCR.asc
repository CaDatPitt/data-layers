ALLEGHENY COUNTY CHAPTER
Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens

PROGRAM SUMMARY

COMMUNITY AND CHAPTER AFFAIRS DIVISION

The Community and Chapter Affairs Division (CCA) was developed
in I969 as ACC-PARC's advocacy arm. The job of Comunity and Chapter
Affairs Division's volunteers and staff, as advocates, is to insure
that existing services are adequate and appropriate. CCA also pres-
sures governmental officials for news services and advocates for the
rights of retarded citizens and their families. An important char-
acteristic of CCA's business is that parents of retarded person
and active citizens spearhead the Division's activities. ‘

The Community and Chapter Affairs Division operates in six
related spheres: right to education, residential care, MH/MR com-
munity services, legislation, emergency casework, and camping and
recreation programs.

Education:

The Education Committee frequently raises issues with the
Pittsburgh Public Schools and the Allegheny Intermediate Unit. Re-
cent Education Committee's activities: actions to increase the
length of the school day, to provide safer and more reliable trans-
portation of students, to improve vocational training programs, and
to provide safer school buildings more suitable for the education
of trainable students, and equal opportunity for physical education.
speech therapy, and decent classroom conditions.

Right to Education:

The Right to Education Director and caseworker advise parents
on how to improve their son's or daughter's education. These staff
members are available to assist parents in preparing for school con-
ferences or due process hearings. Both the Committee members and
staff members meet regularly with the schools to insure that the
Right to Education Consent Agreement is being implemented and all
children are receiving appropriate public education.

Residential Care:

The Residential Care Committee is a very active monitor of the
care provided in state institutions, private residential facilities,
group homes, and foster care. Following frequent unannounced visits.
the Committee makes recommendations to the directors of the residen-
tial programs and the state officials responsible for the quality
of the residential care. It is important to note that most of
Pennsylvania's residential care is inadequate, expensive, and often
unsafe for the institutionalized individuals.

MH/MR Community Services:

A couple years ago this was CCA's major area of work. As a
result of this citizen effort, activity centers in each area of
the county train adults who are not ready for vocational training.
Periodically, Ad Hoc citizen committees and CCA staff will urge
an MB/MR Base Service Unit to develop a new program or improve an
old one.

Legislation:

The Legislation Committee, headed by a parent of a retarded
child, depends on the action of all ACC-PARC members. In December
of 1972, the Chapter presented a package of proposed legislation
to the Allegheny County Delegation of the State Legislature urging
supplemental appropriations to MH/MR Programs, and succeeded cooper-
atively with other citizen groups to have Senate Bill #53 enacted
as law. Senate Bill #53 relieves parents of institutionalized sons
or daughters, age 18 or over, of financial liability for the cost of
their care.

Emergency Casework:

The CCA staff supplements the social service staff when cases
involve courts, broad civil liberties’ issues, or health and safety.

Camping and Recreation:

The Camping Committee composed entirely of parents and siblings
of retarded citizens makes all decisions concerning the operation of
our camping program. The Committee's goal is to obtain summer over-
night and day camping for retarded children and adults from existing
community agencies such as YMCAS, community centers, municipalities,
and girl scouts. The Committee also provides a residential camp
(Camp Sunshine) for children who need one-to-one supervision.

The Camping Committee offers camperships to individuals who
could not otherwise, be able financially, attend. During the 1974
summer, 1,213 children and adults attend more than 12 individual
weeks of camping.

Funding:

Volunteer expenses and the salary of the CCA Director, secretary,
and Camping and Recreation Coordinator (partially) are paid by pro-
ceeds from ACC-PARC's fund drive. Most of the camping and recrea-
tion expenses, including part of the coordinators salary, is paid by
contributions from community groups, a grant from the Edith L. Trees
Charitable Trust, and parents‘ fees. The Right to Education salaries
(director, caseworker, and clerical) are provided by the Allegheny
County MH/MR Program.
