Honorable Milton J. Shapp
Governor of Pennsylvania
State Capitol

. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. Shapp:

This letter is to protest the unfair firing of Dr. James Mcclelland
as superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital. '

V Dr. McC1elland has given many years of service to the Commonwealth

of Pennsylvania and this action was highly uncalled for without a

. complete inquiry into the facts of the case.

I cannot see how a person in just two hours can ruin a man who has

spent over thirty years in helping the mentally retarded of this
atﬁtleo ‘ '

I ask that you examine Dr. Mcclellands record and immediately

‘reinstate him as-superintendent at Polk State School and Hospital.

Very truly yours,

 ////,//#74,
