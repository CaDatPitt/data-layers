November 3, 1972 Mr. Vogt and I visited Polk Stat? School and’ Hospital to
investigate the death-of a resident, Raymond Hellman_on October 16, 1972.‘

Records of the deceased and the resident suspect were reviewed. Dr.i
McClelland then accompanied us to the dormitory where the death occurred.
Mr. werts, the Child Care Aide, who found Mr. Hellmanfs body, demonstrated

, the exact conditions that he found the-morning of October 16, l972 at
5:58 A.M. when he arrived to awaken the residents.

A resident was used as the victim and a sleeveless jacket that laced up
the back was applied. The long restraining cotton strap was-threaded
through the laces and the resident laid down on the bed. The strap was

‘ then pulled through and one end was shorter than the other. Both ends '
were then tied to the bed rails. when questioned if this is the way he
was taught to apply the restraint, Hr. Nertz replied he had not been
taught. He is a_new employee and-has not had the Child Care Aide Training
Course as yet. Another attendant was there and he was asked to demonstrate
the way he was taught to apply_the restraint and this was done satisfactoril*.
Mr. Martin, the Child Care Aide who worked lO:OO P.H. to 6:30 A.M. on
October l6, l972 was then called in and asked to demonstrate how he was
taught to apply the sleeveless jacket restraint. This was done satisfac-

"torily and during conversation, Mr. Martin stated that at no time was it
necessary for him to re-apply the restraint on Mr. Hellman. At 5:15 A.M.
when he made the dorm check, he found Mr. Hellman standing on the left
side of the bed but restraining strap was_only loose from the right side
of the bed. This would have been the short end of the strap. Mr. Martin
‘stated he put N . Hellman back to bed and re-tied the loose end of the

' restraining strap and returned downstairs. At S:hO A.M. he returned to
awaken another resident to take him to the dispensary for a blood sugar.
Nothing seemed to be awry at that time. Mr. Hertz came on duty early and
went to the dorm to awaken all residents and found Raymond Hellman sitting
on the floor on the left side of the bed and the end of the restraining
strap wrapped around his neck several times. Since Mr. Martin had at no
time completely re-applied the restraining strap, it was then necessary-to
talk with the 2:OO P.M. to lO:3O P.M. Child Care Aides. V . Carter was .
asked to demonstrate the application of the jacket and i::§E§'35Vious that
he did not know how. when questioned,.he too replied that he is a new

employee and had not had the Child Care Aide Training Course. He also’
stated that Eaymond Hellman had a habit of having the jacket put on when.
he got ready for bed but the restraining strap would be applied justg
before lights out and this was usually applied by another one of the’
residents. James Ivory.was the resident that applied the restraining
strap on October 15, 1972. nr. Mcvey, the other Child Care worker that
was on duty October 1S, 1972 when the residents were put in bed, was then
questioned. He stated he had gone to the quiet room at 9i00 P.M. to check
Mr. Washington and returned to the dorm about 9:10 P.M. The lights were
out but he did a bed check and remained in the dorm until Mr. Wartin came
on duty. - ‘-

All of the Child Care Aides were questioned as to whether they saw any

excess strap on the floor when they checked the restraints and the answer~
was “no”. They also felt that any excess strap laying on the floor would

have caught their attention. p'

It.was also brought out that Raymond Hellman was capable of releasing the
restraining strap himself as_his arms'were free and had done it in they
past. Raymond Hellman was also spastic and frequently he would call out
in the night and ask one of the residents to help him to the bathroom.
One of the residents told Dr. AcClelland and the police that on the_night
involved, James Ivory had either taken haymond Hellman to the bathroom or
had found him there and put him back to bed. ' ' " 7

The Staff ratio the night of the unfortunate incident was:'

of entire male service '

This is in response to the report of Pat Gishbaugher concerning the above
subject. Pat and Bob Vogt visited Polk State School and Hospital at my
request following receipt of a msmorandum £ron.Kr. Frank S._Beal requesting
a re-visit. Hr. Seal was questioning the possibility of staff negligence
and need for a reprimand from the Regional Office.‘ . . ‘ V
{ If anything should be reprimanded, it is our entire lousy system; however,
it is obvious that attendant staff is not trained or*instructed on how'to
apply the sleeveless jacket restraint., This would raise the question as
'to whether or not instruction_has been given in the use of any mecnanical
restraint. Dr. James H. Hcclolland should be ﬂnstructed to provide such
instructions immediately; f ~_ i A ' ' * ' tﬁ
H.; Vogt informed me that the night attendants stay on the first floor, in
the dayroon, unile the sixteen (16) residents sleep on the second floor.
Unless there is some exceptionally good reason for this, it would be better
for the attendants to have a desk and telephone on the second floor.

I do not feel that the attendant who was on dnty can.be held at fault for
negligence. It is my understanding that this attendant has since resigned
his Job. i S ~e -; ' ' ’ l
