never attended school. The child is now registered, tested,
and beginning her education at an Intermediate Unit Special
Center. '

Monitoring - Pittsburgh Schools

As a result of ACC—PARC's leadership, a committee of the
Right to Education Task Force, led by parents, monitors
the quality of educational settings. Twenty visits have
been made in the last four months.

Training Parent Trainers

ACC-PARC helped develop a program to train at least 100
parents as parent trainers. The goal is that parents will
be able to use the I.E.P. (Individualized Educational Plan)
process to improve their child's education.

Parent School Conference - Penn Hills

ACC-PARC staff attended a parent/school conference to consider
integration of child in "regular" classes. Assistance in-
cluded preparation, support, and evaluation.

Expedite School Placement

ACC—PARC requested Pittsburgh Schools to make immediate place-
ment which allowed a transfer of a girl from an institution to
a group home. Prior to our intervention, the School Board
refused to make the placement. The school placement was made
and the child was placed in a group home.

900 vs. 990 Hours of Instruction

Our State PARC Education Committee, led by an ACC—PARC member,
has demanded that the Department of Education comply with the
state law requiring 990 hours of instruction per pupil per
year. The current school calendar of 900 hours is a violation
of the law. The Attorney General and State Senators now have
told the Secretary of Education to obey the law.

Filling Educational Advocate Position

The staff position is unfilled. Over 200 applications have
been reviewed. Interviews are being held.

mented as a result of our efforts.

Adult Services

T.A.C._Needed - St. Francis Area

According to several parents, a T.A.C. (Therapeutic Activity
Center) is needed in the St. Francis Catchment area. ACC-PARC
is working with the parents to request this program from the
MH/MR Center.

Community Services

MH/MR Public Hearings

On February 16th, 15 parents testified about the lack of com-
munity services. The parents told the County MH/MR Board

and Administrator of the serious needs of their children and
family members.

The unmet needs were in four areas:

1) respite care for families of sons or daughters who have a
wide range of abilities

2) programs for individuals who are both severely physically
and mentally handicapped

3) programs for mentally retarded individuals who are also
emotionally disturbed or exhibiting behavior problems

H) adult training programs

The parents‘ statements made an impact on the MH/MR Board
and staff. ACC-PARC is following up and asking for concrete
action to start meeting these needs.

Parent Group Support

ACC-PARC brought attornies to meet with Western Center's
Parents Group to discuss a class action suit to improve the
conditions and.programs for the residents currently at Western
Center. Discussions are continuing.

Highland Park Center

The parents at Highland Park Center are concerned about the
need for more staff, more services, an alarming increase in
accidents and injuries, and the unresponsiveness of the
Highland Park Center administration. ACC-PARC is responding
with a major review of these problems.

Public Education, Training, Prevention

Television Interviews

ACC-PARC has appeared on public interest shows televised by
WTAE (Channel H) and KDKA (Channel 2). The topics were
"The Plight of Handicapped Persons" and "Right to Education".

ACC-PARC is also working to have Public Service Announcements
about "Right to Education" scheduled for T.V. and radio.

Information and Referral

Telephone Calls

ACC-PARC receives many phone calls from parents and agencies.
Often the best assistance is to provide information or referral
to another agency.

Protective Services for Future

MH/MR Public Hearing

The parents who testified at the MH/MR hearings emphasized
that no appropriate residential programs exist for many of
their sons or daughters. The parents pleaded for these
specialized residential services to be planned, funded,
and implemented.

Alternatives to Institution Development

Polk Dispersal - Phase II

ACC-PARC has reviewed and agreed with Allegheny County's
Polk Dispersal Phase II plans. The plan includes 12 new

CLA (Community Living Arrangements) programs to be developed
in the next four months.

The new programs include several special programs for children,
for habit shaping, and for medical attention. A total of 110
persons will be served in these new programs.

The facilities will be dispersed in every part of the County.
This will be the beginning of CLA programs in 7 sponsoring
agencies. There will be a day program for each person. The
people will reside in apartments or small houses for a maxi-
mum of 3 persons.

Next Year's Budget

The Governor's proposed budget for next year provides for a
37% increase in funds over the current year. This proposed
expansion is in contrast to no or minimal increases in most
other departments. We will support this $8 million dollar
increase by asking our members to influence their legislators.

Legislative
Senate Bill #9u

ACC-PARC's cooperative efforts with United Mental Health and
lobbyists on "the hill" resulted in the passage of Senate
Bill #9M by the House of Representatives. The vote on

March luth was 113 to 80.

Senate Bill #9M allows a community residential facility to be
located by right in any residential neighborhood and prevents
the saturation of any neighborhood by establishing distances
between any two homes.

The bill was written by a local committee which included
ACC-PARC's Executive Director. Differences between the House
passed version and the Senate passed version must be worked
out before final passage.
