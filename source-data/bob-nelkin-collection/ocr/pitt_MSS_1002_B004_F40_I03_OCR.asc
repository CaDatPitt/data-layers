Dear Norman:

our Residential care cnnittee is appalled that 2 a gfﬁg
new admissions are being accepted at Polk state school “V”
and Hospital. why did you let this occur?

Did the Department use all its resources to fight
the court adniseion? Did high-level Departeent offi-
cials testify to Polk's inability to deliver proper
care and treatment for this individual? Did Depart- 2 ;,-
nent officials arrange and propose funding for an «cg:
alternative program for this individual? Did the ﬁi
Department have qualified legal counsel to present ‘S*%
the case in opposition to admission? Did the Depart— —.
nent offer espert testimony from knowledgeable con- , «
aultants on the potential danger of this admission? '-.a

Regardless of the Department's willingness or
unwillingness to vigorously fight this oourt adnis~
sion. we would have tried. Hhy didn't you call on
us to help? Any admission to Polk defeats your goals
for the Polk Dispersal Project. Why can't the Depart- »;fr
nent (your office) take a fire stand and try to win? g‘;
why are we breaking our necks trying to reduce the ?
Polk population when you are pereitting new admissions? ‘ e -
