Dear Charlie,

During last Spring’s "Strategy for Advocacy" Conference in Allentown, we discussed
the implications of the PARC right to education suit. In the light of that discussion,
I thought I should share with you a recent experience of mine at a state institution in
Pennsylvania. I

I visited this facility during an unrelated visit to Western Pennsylvania, in line
with my long-term interest in institutions for developmentally disabled persons. During
my tour of this institution, I was able to gain a great deal of first-hand information
on the nature of educational programs available to its school-age residents.

Quite frankly, I was deeply concerned and distressed by both the poor quality of

. life and inadequacy of educational programming at this institution. Let me briefly de-

scribe aspects of the educational program which I consider inconsistent with the PARC
consent agreement: '

1. Although my tour was conducted between the hours of ll:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on
a weekday (regular school day), I found large numbers of school-age residents (over
20 on each of approximately eight units) who were not participating in any educa-
tional programs. To the contrary, these residents sat or stood around on large
wards with no activities. Although administrators of the institution claimed that
all school-age residents receive educational programming, they were unable to ex-
plain this situation.

2. In classrooms on the grounds of the institution, I observed children sleeping
during class hours, without any apparent attempt by staff to involve them in activ-
ities. '

3. I was informed by facility administrators that the "intermediate unit" of the
Pennsylvania State Department of Education had rented buildings in the community
to which children at the institution were transported to receive educational pro-
gramming. These children were segregated in these buildings and denied Contact
with either typical children or developmentally disabled children who reside in
the community. This seems to be a direct violation of the principle that children
should be educated under the least restrictive circumstances possible.
