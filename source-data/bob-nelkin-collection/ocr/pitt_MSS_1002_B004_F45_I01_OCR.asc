Resolution VI, 23rd Annual PARC Convention

On June 9, l973, the general membership of the Pennsylvania Association
for Retarded Children adopted Resolution VI concerning the Rights of
Institutionalized Retarded Citizens;

This Resolution committed every Chapter of PARC to place as one of their
first priorities the responsibility to monitor institutions within their
geographical area.

As you know in the past year, a parent training program was instituted
to train in methods of monitoring and evaluating public institutions.
The PARC Regional Vice Presidents took a major responsibility in con-
ducting these training programs and a number of people were trained
and gained a sensitivity in order to go into institutions.

I am asking our Regional Vice Presidents to take specific responsibilities
to coordinate such training programs once again this year and I will be
looking for a continued effort on the part of every chapter to work
together with institutions to improve the facilities and to be sure

that the conditions for the mentally retarded are safe. ’

I will appreciate your responses and indications of what steps and plans

*”§9ybu are instituting within your counties.

RIGHTS OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RETARDED CITIZENS

WHEREAS, the offenses against the rights of institutionalized retarded
citizens are legion; and

WHEREAS, the current methods of'monitoring the state institutions for the
mentally retarded have failed to assure the rights of.retarded
citizens within institutions.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT.RESOLVED that all local chapters of the Pennsylvania
Association for Retarded Children place as one of their first
priorities the responsibility to monitor institutions within
their geographical area; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that though the eventual solution of the problems
associated with institutionalized residents is community residences,
the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children and all of its
local chapters must demonstrate real concern fer institutionalized
retarded citizens through constant monitoring and reporting of'any
offenses to the official in charge of the institution as well as
the state association.

Duly enacted this ninth day of June, nineteen hundred and seventy-three.
