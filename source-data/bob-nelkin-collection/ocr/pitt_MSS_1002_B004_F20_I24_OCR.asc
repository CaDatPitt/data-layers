. Copy of telegram sent to the Honorable Milton Shapp, Governor,
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on April 23,.l973.

We wish to advise you of our shock at, and complete
rejection of, the recent dismissal of Dr. James Mcclelland

: as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital. Our

office as been swamped by calls from an incensed citizenry

‘representing this entire region, demanding his reinstatement~

and the chastisement of PARC and those involved from your
Department of Welfare. We would remind you then that to
govern is to rule without soveriegn power with the aim of
keeping a straight course and smooth operation for the good

of the whole. This then dictates Dr. McClelland's vindication

_which we support. Justice must prevail.
