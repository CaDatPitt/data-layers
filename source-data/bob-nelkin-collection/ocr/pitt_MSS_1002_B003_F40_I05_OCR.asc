The Honorable Helene Wohlgemuth
Secretary of Public Welfare .
Room 333, Health 8; Welfare Building’

I Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:

I wish to register an official protest againstthe structure of the investigating personnel
that you have sent to the Western State School and Hospital, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania
at the request of the Governor's Office.

‘Very frankly, I do not believe that you or any of your co-workers should be given the

authority to make this investigation, because I am doubtful that those who are involved
can investigate themselves. You did not, as the Secretary of Welfare, nor your staff,
have the courtesy to inform the Coroner of Washington County that an investigation was
goingon. The public and the parents of these unfortunate patients are not aware of an
investigation and, therefore, '1 term it a ‘secret commission’ to more or‘ less cover up
the whole issue. ' ‘

It is my personal opinion that you are a co-conspirator of the. deplorable situations that .
exist at this institution. As _the Secretary of Welfare, you have the full authority, and
should have exercised this authority, to make sure that such tragic events that have
occurred in this institution did not take place.

As’ the Secretary, and not recognising the fact that the institution was overcrowded, is
an error that is inexcusable on your part and not to provide the personnel needed to give
the careand protection that each patient needs, and is entitled to, lies directly at your _
door‘.

My personal feeling is that the Coroner's Office of Washington County-should not have
been the one to bring these things to your attention; and if you allow people under your

-direction to run an institution who do not keep you fully informed, then you-are not

carrying out fully your duties as Secretary of Welfare.

The death of two at this institution, one of drowning" and one of choking to death, and
the recent rat~infested candy issue, leads this office to believe, and I am sure the public,

’L/%‘é5»:4  

'1.‘hellonorab1e Helene Wohlgemuth, ii November 29, 197»;

that no one gives a damn what is happening there, and this includes you and your
staff, and I am sure from what Ihave learned, there are many other issues in this
institution that need immediate attention, and correction. -

We in Washington County are quite surprised that you, being in control of the insti-
tution and its problems, allow it to be understaffed and overpopulated; yet in the
same instance you demand from other people of the county government they eliminate
these problems immediately in their hospitals and _homes for the aged with the threat
of prosecution if they don‘t. It is disgraceful you cannot carry out under the law
what you demand others to ‘do under the law. , . '
As a public official I am tired of hearing of ‘secret investigations‘ and ‘secret meetings‘
and I know the public is of the same opinion in that respect. If you are not aware of
the feelings of the public, it is time for you to come out of the glass tower of your
office and see what is going on.

In conclusion, this is ivhy I do not believe that your report by your staff is the proper
thing for the public to accept under these circumstances and, upon the return of

Governor Shapp, this office will make it very clear that we demand a non-partisan
investigation into this institution‘.

. Yours very truly
Farrell Jackson L V
Coroner
