INTRODUCTION

The Halderman vs. Pennhurst suit was first filed in Federal District
Court in May 1974. In an opinion filed on December 23, 1977 the Court found
that the institution was unacceptable on Constitutional, state statutory
and Federal statutory grounds. The judge suggested that the parties meet
in an attempt to agree upon a court order which would be agreeable to all
parties. The parties informed the Court that they had Leen unable to agree
and would never be able to come to an agreement. As a result, an order of
judgment was handed down by the Court on March 17, 1978 in favor of the
plaintiffs and against the defendants.

As part of Judge Broderick's March 17th Order, the Office of the Special
Master was formed. The Special Master was given "the power and duty to plan,
organize, direct, supervise, and monitor the implementation of this and any
further Orders of the Court." Included in this Order were provisions for
the development of an Individual Habilitation Plan for each member of the
plaintiff_class. In addition the Court requested a plan for the development
of mechanisms to monitor community services, to be sure that appropriate‘
services were continuously being provided to members of the plaintiff class
in the least restrictive environment possible.

One must then ask whether or not Judge Broderick's Order of March 17, as
well as subsequent Orders, produced any visible changes in the lives of the
clients in the plaintiff class. while change can be measured along several
dimensions, we have chosen to look at developmental growth over a two year
period in both adaptive and maladaptive behavior. The research question is:
once they have been placed in CLAs, do Pennhurst Class members show developmental

growth patterns that are different from those of other CLA clients?

METHODS

Subjects
The subjects for this study were 103 mentally retarded people living"

in Comunity Living Arrangements (CLAs) in Philadelphia. The total Philadelphia
CLA population had 237 residents, 174 of which had two Behavior Development
Surveys administered. The members of our sample were the first 103 people
with two forms completed, and there was no reason to believe it was biased.
Table 1 presents the demographic information on the sample used (N=103) and

the population from which it was drawn (N=237).

Although the sample was not chosen randomly, the demographics are comparable
to that of the total Philadelphia CLA population (particularly for sex and
level of retardation), and the sample appears to be representative of the
entire population.
The sample can be broken down into three groups which are of particular
interest._ They are: .
CLASS A Pennhurst class members who were at Pennhurst Center but left
after Judge Broderick's March 1978 Order (N=25).
NON-CLASS Non—class members who were at Pennhurst Center but left before
the March 1978 Order (N=36).
NEVER AT PC ‘This group was never at Pennhurst Center (N=42).

Instrumentation

The Behavior Development Survey (BDS) is the instrument used to measure
client functioning. It is actually a short version of the AAMD Adaptive
Behavior Scale, developed by the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Research Group at
Lanterman State Hospital, by selecting only the most reliable and valid items
from the full scale. The BDS has separate sections on adaptive and maladaptive

behavior, and uses change over time to measure developmental growth.

Procedures

The BDS was first administered in early 1979 to all residents of
Philadelphia CLAs. In early 1981, approximately two years later, the BDS
was re-administered. This report examines the changes found in the three

groups for that period of time.

RESULTS

The three groups which form the sample are broken down by level of

retardation in Table 2.

LEVEL OF RETARDATION BY GROUP

LEVEL OF RETARDATION
Mild 16%‘ 47% 28%
Moderate 40% 39% 33%
Severe 44% ll% 29%
Profound 0% 3% 10%

This table reveals that the CLASS and NEVER AT PC groups have a high propor-
tion of severelyprofoundly retarded residents while the NON-CLASS group is’
mostly mild /moderate. CLASS and NEVER AT PC groups also have very similar
male/female distributions; the NON-CLASS members contain a very high
proportion of males (81%). The CLASS, NON-CLASS and NEVER AT PC groups have
mean ages of 43, 41, and 34, reSPeCtlV€lV- A one—way ANOVA reveals a signif-
icant age difference (F = 5.8, p = .004) between the NEVER AT PC group and
the other two groups.

Since the Behavior Development Survey has been administered twice for
every member of the sample, an examination of the data can show what progress
the three groups have made over time; Adding together all the pertinent items
on the forms, we have computed adaptive and maladaptive behavior sum scores,
which represent overall functioning levels in each area. The overall change

scores for the entire sample were 0.42 points gained in adaptive behavior

sum (NS) and_1.67 points gained in maladaptive behavior sum (T = 4.50,
p = .000). These figures are very similar to those found for the entire
population (increase of 0.53 points in adaptive behavior and 1.57 points

in maladaptive behavior).

Table 3 shows the sum score changes found for the three groups.

NON-CLASS 36 100.69 99.28 -1.42

NEVER AT PC 42 17.52 19.64 +2.11

OVERALL 103 18.19 19.79 +1.67

In regard to adaptive behavior, CLASS members gained 5.88 points while NON-
CLASS and {EVER AT PC members lost 1.42 and 1.17 points, respectively (it
should be noted that an increase in the adaptive behavior sum score is desira-
ble). A one-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between CLASS members
and the other two groups (F = 3.88, p = .024) in the amount of change in
adaptive behavior skills. Hence we conclude that CLASS members gained signi-

ficantly in adaptive behavior while the other two groups did not.

Figure 1 presents a graph of adaptive behavior sum change for the three
groups. It shows that the CLASS and NEVER AT PC groups started at approxi-
mateiy the same adaptive behavior 1eve1; however, the CLASS members gained
points while the NEVER AT PC groups did not change significantiy. The NON-
CLASS members started at a much higher Tevei than the other two groups, but
faiied to show a significant change.

No difference was found among the three groups in maiadaptive behavior;
ail three groups improved. An increase in maiadaptive behavior sum score is
the desired resu1t, since it indicates a decrease in ma1adaptive behavior. The
one-way ANOVA on maiadaptive behavior sum change failed to show a
significant difference among the three groups (F = .759, p = .471). Hence

we conciude that all three groups improved about equaT1y in reducing problem

behavior.

DISCUSSION

As the results indicate, there are differences in characteristics among
the three groups (CLASS, NON-CLASS, and NEVER AT PC). when one looks at the
three groups with regard to the level of retardation, it is apparent that

impaired individuals, while the other two groups have a larger percentage of

consistent criteria for selection for placement in the community.

Upon examining adaptive behavior growth for the three groups, signifi-
cant differences have been found. Both the NON-CLASS members and NEVER AT
PC groups lost slightly in adaptive behavior, in marked contrast to the 5.88
gain in adaptive behavior for CLASS members. All groups improved significantly,

and the same amount, in the maladaptive behavior area.

while most provider agencies maintain Individual Program Plans for each

client, CLASS members, as ordered by the Court, must have Individual‘

Habilitation Plans which must be approved by the Office of the Special Master.'

_The Individaul Habilitation Plan contains nine areas (Health, Sensory/Motor

Skills, Communication Skills, Activities of Daily Living Skills, Vocational/
Education Skills, Social Interactions, Self-concept/Coping Skills, Leisure/
Recreational/Religious Activities, and Other Special Concerns). The Master's

Office has requested that there be one goal in each area. In addition, goals

must be written in a behavioral objective format, must have a timeline, and
must list a person responsible for monitoring and supervision of each goal.
The Office of the Special Master periodically monitors clients‘ programs

to ensure that services are being provided as prescribed in the IHP. The
responsibility for coordination of services is that of the Pennhurst Case
Managers..

Thus the clients covered by the Pennhurst court order enjoy several

gprotections not available to others, among which are strict written plan

requirements, regular monitoring, and specially assigned Case Managers.
while this study has not established that the cause of greater develop-
mental growth among CLASS members is the court protections, the data cer-

tainly suggest that class members have been doing better. The average CLA

' client improves in the maladaptive behavior area, but not in adaptive

behavior; CLA clients who are CLASS members improve in both areas. we
regard this as the first evidence that the quality of written plans, systematic

monitoring, and good case management go_make a difference.
