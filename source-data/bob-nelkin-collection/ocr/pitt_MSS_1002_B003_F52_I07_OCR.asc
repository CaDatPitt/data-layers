I wish to record in this letter our objection to
the type of punishment recently administered to Howard
9-. a student in your comunity-based classes.

We acknowledge the sound basis for: making a
point about truancy to Howard ad fellow students,
achieving the positive results (no hooky) by this
punishment. and distinguishing Howard's education
lor the day from other students at his punishent
site. However, we feel the punishment is extreme
and sets a precedent subject to considerable abuse.

By your own adaission, the purpose for sending
Howard to this specific unit for the punishment day
was that it would be 'unpleasant'. Howard personally
acknowledged that this was the result. If we accepted
this type of punishaent. we would question whethereit
was necessary to place Howard with individuals so
much less able than he. at the very least. he should
have been sent to a class with people closer to his
ability level. the purpose of punishment should not
be to degrade or scare an individual.

Given the history ot excessive punishaent to
residents at Western state school and Hospital. we
see the placement of an able individual on a unit with
severely disabled individuals as a dangerous precedent.

while it can be argued that in this case you made
special provisions for hie to do regular werk and that
the result was positive in your estieation. there are
no guarantees that similar controls will be euceroised
in sieiler cases using the ease type of punishaent.
The possibilities exist that the next person adainis-
terinq such punisheent: will make it last for a week.
will not eake provisions for the student to do work
on his own level, will not have the sane ‘teaching’
motives that you have expressed. will apply this
method to an individual uh cannot understand the
punishment, will not consider the possible emotional
reaction to such a placement. we hope this is the
last punishment where an individual is placed in a
unit with nore severely disabled people as a punish-
nent. -

rinally. we are concerned that there are no
guidelines for the administration of discipline
to H383 students in the Interudiate Unit Program.
we urge you to create such guidelines in consultation
with parents. advocates, and W588 administration.
we don't believe discipline can be administered with-
out written discipline guidelines approved as policy
by the Intereediate Unit or the state Department of
Education. We would appreciate a copy of such
guidelines as soon as they are drafted.

Sincerely,

Robert Nelkin
