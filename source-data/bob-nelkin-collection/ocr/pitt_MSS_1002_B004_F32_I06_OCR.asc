CLA PLAN - FY 77-78

The CLA Plan for FY 77-78 has been-modified since the Polk

Dispersal Project has been given a high priority by the Department. A
detailed response is being prepared to be submitted to the Deputy
Secretary, Office of Mental Retardation. The CLA Plan will be an integral
part of this plan. It is anticipated that this plan may be revised again
as we work with the OMR regarding their plans for Polk Center and the needs

assessment which will be cruci- - development of a plan for the
further dispersal of Polk Center residents.

 
 
  

The Administrator's Office must also view the CLA,Plan and Polk
Center dispersal in light of other demands on the county service system.
This office must ensure that expansion of CLA programs related to "special
projects" does not exceed the MH/MR service system's management capacity.
In particular, the CLA providers,_day program services and case management
units are presently completing the Western Center and Marcy Dispersal
Many of the providers involved in these two efforts have
indicated they can not expand further during FY 77-78.

The Polk Center residents, because of their present level of
functioning, will require significant support services. . _
be felt throughout the service system and this office must ensure that the
system can implement all facets of the necessary services. At the same
time, the demand for services for present community residents is increasing
and our limited resources must address the community needs as well as the
needs of Allegheny County residents at Polk Center and other state-operated
facilities. To this end, we lbok forward to working with the OMB, both in
the region and in Harrisburg, to meet these needs. _ . _;
