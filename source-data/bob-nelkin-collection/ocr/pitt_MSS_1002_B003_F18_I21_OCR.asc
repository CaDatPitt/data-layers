Dear Judge Cohillz

It has come to my attention that you will be hearing the case
of Joyce _ from St. Francis Catchment Area on October 9, 1974.
Miss _ is physically handicapped and M1-I/MR is suggesting that
she should be admitted as a resident to Western State School and
Hospital.

VI would like to appear before the court on that date and pre-
sent information about the appropriateness of any placement at that
institution, information that might help you in your determination.

Sincerely yours ,

.——_..._.
