Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth. P am‘ "‘4"”~

Enclosed is a copy of our position statement which we sent to the

news releases on Tuesday, April 24. We are sending a copy of the same

..to the Governor and to the President of the Pennsylvania Association for

Retarded Children.

We are deeply concerned with the adverse criticism regarding our
retarded children as a result 03 the dismissal of Dr. James McClelland, and
are hopeful that this criticism will not set us back in our programming
for_children for whom you have been so concerned.

Perhaps, we in Northwestern Pennsylvania are getting more of the

«"flack" than the eastern part of the state, but the criticism is running

rampant about the manner in which the Superintendent was released.

We are trying as an Association to cement the relations between
all groups concerned with retarded children and we trust that our efforts
will bear fruit.

We want you to know that we appreciate all you are doing for the
welfare of retarded children.

Sincerely yours,

‘7aI,.. 

Mrs. Edward Lubecki,
President

Mrs. Edward Lubecki, President of the Erie Association for Retarded
Children, Inc., meeting with the Executive Comittee of the Erie Association.
for Retarded Children on Monday evening, April 23, 1973, issued the
following position statement:

"The Erie Association for Retarded Children is concerned with all
retarded persons living in institutions, private or public, in the community,
in their homes, in foster homes, or group homes.

‘The Association is concerned that all retarded children and adults be
treated with kindness, love and dignity and that they receive training and
education that will move them from dependence to independence.

We further assert the right of parents to speak on behalf of their

children whether they are in an institution or in the community.

We are not fully cognizant of all of the reasons for the dismissal of
Dr. James McClelland, Superintendent of Polk State School. However, we do
believe the Board of Trustees of Polk State School should have been involved
in any decisionemaking regarding the operation of the Institution.

Wince Erie County has children at Polk State School, we as an
Association fully affirm the request of Dr. James McClelland for a hearing,
and we further concur with the request of our local legislators for a full
review of the facts so that all people affected will be fully aware of the

factors upon which this decision was reached."
