Dear Chuck:

I agree with your assessment of Mr-'s letter, a copy of which you
forwarded to me. It does seem inappropriate to prohibit private use of
a telephone between residents in a state facility (including Folk) and
their families. As a matter of Fact, this will be one of the rights in
the “Bill of ﬂights" for the mentally retarded in institutions and
private licensed facilities.

with regard to Polk State School and Hospital, we will instruct Dr.
Mcclelland to review and appropriately revise his rule to permit use of
a private pay telephone. '

I am referring your letter with attachments along with my letter to you
to my staff. They will follonpup with Dr. Meclelland.

Thank you for referring this information to us.

Sincerely,

%€»/

Ralph In Meador
Commissioner
Mental Health and Mental Retardation
