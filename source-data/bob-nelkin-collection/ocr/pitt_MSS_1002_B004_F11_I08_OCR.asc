any such “mitzva” has taken place
anywhere. .

Out of the 21 bar-bat mitzvah’
boys and girls, only nine will ac- '

The institutions will provide.

transportation for the residents to

largely through the efforts of
Joseph Columbatto, superin-
tendent at Polk, that the mass bar-
bat mitzvah is possible.

the service are Governor Milton ,
Shapp, State Secretary of Health ~
and Welfare Helene Wohlgemuth, .
