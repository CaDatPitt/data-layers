Dear Mr. Nelkin:

I am writing in regard to my sister, Mary Z-,
who is being considered for the Transitional Living Program.

I have discussed this wi sister, Mrs. Lillian
Pallonex my brothers, Mr. Peter Z and Mr. Chelse Cussali.
We are all in agreement that this program would be wrong for
our sister Mary.

   

There are many reasons why we feel very strongly
about this. Mary has always had a fear of being alone for as
long as I can remember. She has always had complete superâ€”
vision at all times. For her to eventually be left to do
everything for herself is not the answer. My next and very
strongest point, should be taken "seriously" into your
consideration before making this move. At Mary's last
evaluation test, we were told that she had the mentality of a
4 or 4 1/2 year old child. Would you leave any normal 4 or 4 1/2
year old child to shift for themselves? This would normally
be called Child Neglect. Mary may appear physically to be
an adult, but mentally she is not. I understand the three
phases of Transitional Living. The main thing that I object
to is the third phase, which is these "so called" adults to be
left on their own. I have been told that the locations for
these homes for Transitional Living will be located in
Normal people take
caution in these areas when out, let alone a mentally retarded
adult who could be easily taken advantage of. There is much
danger in these streets for them and how would they cope with
it if they had to. Wasn't this why they were placed in these
institutions to start with?

, Mr. Nelkin, I am only deeply concerned
with Mary's welfare. I am waiting anxiously for your reply.

Please take this into consideration before placing Mary into
this program.

Sincerely yours,

Mrs. Elizabeth J. Carello
