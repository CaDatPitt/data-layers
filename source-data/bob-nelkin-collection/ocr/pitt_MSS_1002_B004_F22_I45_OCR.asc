Dear Helene,

on April 17, 1973, you condemned the use of cages. "g;
is indefensible in this day and age that human beings should
be subjected to such degradation and dehumanization."

On December 11, 1973, our Residential Care Committee
visited Polk's Gardenside Building. Young women were tied to
their benches. The cages as physical structures are gone, but

humans are still shackled like animals. In case of fire, the
women would have to be cut loose by a knife or perish.

Are bench ties defensible? Is this humane treatment?
Were bench ties recommended by your nationally collected team
of experts and Pennsylvania superintendents? Where are the
alternative treatments that you promised for these caged women?

Your response to deplorable conditions and inadequate care
was: "The only immediate answer is to provide a change in leader-
ship, to assure that the treatment and programs at Polk are
gu ckly corrected.

Our response is that a change in leadership was not enough.
Offensive body odors, paupers' rags as dresses, urine soaked
pants, rows of unprivate toilets, beds crammed close, many women
without socks, identical haircuts, little individual attention,
factory style feeding, and no activity besides rocking and sitting
still exist.

On Sunday, July 22. 1973, Governor Milton Shapp commented
on improvements at Polk as reported by you..."Changes within

Somebody misinformed Governor Shapp. His description of
changes does not apply to the Gardenside Building. I doubt

that the Governor's words describe any living unit at Polk be-
sides Cottage 1. '

The conditions at Polk are disgraceful. The failure to
achieve major reforms is shameful.

The absence of care and training is unfair to every women
of Gardenside. They are treated as savages, not human beings.

It is immoral that since April 17th the Governor and you C

have not helped the Gardenside citizens by improving their
care or training.

Helene, what are you and the Governor going to do?
Sincerely,
G-n\ruﬁ’T‘\\o"r\ K
