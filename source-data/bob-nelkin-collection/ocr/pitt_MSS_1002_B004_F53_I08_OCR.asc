Dear Dottie:

As a result of ARC of Allegheny County and of Pennsyl-
vania visits‘ to" State Centers over the past several months.
I would like to submit a list of A.R.C.'s recommendations
for the Centers. Some of the recommendations I have
previously discussed with you. -

1. Direct care staff seminars: Direct care staff/
aides who have shown creativity and ability could meet in a
two day session to share'ideas on programs which they
have developed at their center. A guest facilitator could
be invited.

2. Resource Guide: Ideas on effective programs and
equipment for severely handicapped clients, as well as age
appropriate resources used by Center staff, should be col-
lected by the Central Office. This could be published
annually to promote an exchange of effective ideas.

3. Use of community and other program resources:

a. Encourage center staff visits to community
programs and specialized Center programs for exchange
of ideas i.e. programs for visually imparred, com-
munity workshops, etc.

b. Encourage center use of community volunteer
resources i.e. volunteers from colleges, Foster Grand-
parent Programs, etc.

4. Inservice training on meals: Creative approaches
should be utilized to make meal times more normalized.
A possible guest speaker could be Robert Perske.

5. Development of handbook on suitable environments

in Centers: O.M.R. could develop a handbook to be used by

centers similar to the O.M.H. Handbook on Creating Therapeu-
tic Environments in State Hospitals.

6. Development of a unified system of program planning
across state centers: A system should be developed which
would make aides more aware of and able to carry out
individual program plans.

Also, as we had discussed, has a decision been reached
on notifying A.R.C. of serious incidents and unusual deaths
at State Centers when they occur?

We look forward to meeting with you to discuss our
recommendations in more detail. Please call me to arrange
a meeting time which would be convenient for you.

Sincerely,
