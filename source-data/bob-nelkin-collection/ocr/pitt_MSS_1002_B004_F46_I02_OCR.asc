Time marches on and the bureaucratic wheels slowly turn.
A meeting in Harrisburg was scheduled for January 25, l978 for a
discussion of the poaaibﬂe dental problems in the mental retardation
centers. Unfortunately, if you recall, I was snowed in at the
Pittsburgh Airport.

The January meeting was rescheduled for April 26, 1978.

In addition to the two of us, Mr. Elser and Dr. Rusynyk were in
attendance. The slides of the mouths of the residents from western
were shown again. It was at this meeting that Mr. Elser stated
that it was his understanding that these slides demonstrate as much
physical abuse as if someone were to punch the child. A decision
was then made that the dental programs at one or two state centers
would be examined at some time in the near future.

Subsequently, on July l7, l8, and 19, l978, I visited

Ebensburg Center and Cresson Center. Hy expenses were paid by a
contract from the Department of Health and the three days were
covered through administrative leave time from western. The initial
meeting at Ebensburg was with Mr. Elser, Mr. Robert Vogt, whose
immediate superior is Mr. Ford Thompson, Deputy Secretary, Central
Region, Mr. Joseph Foster, Superintendent, Cresson Center, Dr. Donald
Hartley, Superintendent, Ebensburg Center, Dr. Rusynyk and myself.
The three day format was informally discussed with the major emphasis
on scheduling and timing. On Wednesday, July 19, 1978, an exit
interview was conducted at the Altoona Center with Dr. Rusynyk, Dr.
Hartley and Mr. Foster. - I

On September I5, l978 I hand carried my two reports, one
on the dental program at Cresson and one for Ebensburg, to your
office. In attendance at the meeting were Mr. Elser, Mr. Vogt, Mr.
Thompson, Dr. Hartley, and Dr. Rusynyk. The meeting ended with the
realization that there was an important issue to be dealt with and
that Aldo Colautti, Secretary, Department of Public Welfare, would
have to be informed. Dr. Hartley and I both left the meeting feeling
assured that Mr. Colautti would be informed early the following week
and quick action would follow. Much to my dismay, that was not the
case.

Unfortunately, this entire scenario does not seem to be
representative of a concerned agency eager to take action on a very
important issue. In Mr. Elser's words, "we are a crisis oriented

bureaucracy; show us a crisis and we will have to act". The unfor-
tunate thing is that I do not believe my reports were the first
awareness you had of this crisis, nor do I believe that our
November, l977 meeting was your initiation into the world of bad
institutional dentistry. According to reliable sources, you. and
many others in the department, had been aware of dental problems
for quite some time. My reports should have provided the catalyst
for major, definitive action. As of this writing, the ptanned
investigation by a team of dentists does not seem to constitute the
type of action which is needed.

On September 29, 1978, I attempted to contact Dr. David
Wallace, Director, Bureau of Dental Services, Department of Health.
However, he was in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Or. Rusynyk returned my
call later the same day and told me that Dr. Wallace had been in-
formally contacted on Monday, September 25, 1978, in a meeting in
which you, Mr. Elser, and Dr. Rusynyk were present. The discussion
dealt with investigating and substantiating my reports. were I not
the author of the reports, I would ask why, after hiring someone to
do an investigation, would you have to contract another group to
investigate the investigation. A further delay seems to develop
when Dr. Rusynyk tells me that Dr. Wallace will need direction from
Mr. Aldo Colautti, Secretary, Department of Public Welfare, and Dr.
Leonard Bachman, Secretary, Department of Health.

On Tuesday, October 3, 1978, I finally got in touch with
Dr. Wallace. He said, relative to the September 25 meeting, that
the two Secretaries would have to get together to decide his func-
tion and authority regarding the proposed investigation. A very
interesting set of circumstances came to light during this conver-
sation. Dr. Wallace told me that approximately four years ago Dr.
Bachman sent him a memo saying that he and his department would act
as professional and technical consultants to the Department of
Welfare Dental Programs. The major areas of concern included con-
ducting continuing education courses, standardizing forms to assess
quality, and actual patient checks. when I asked him if he had con-
ducted any patient checks himself, he said he had not but that Ralph
(Dr. Rusynyk) may have. I assume his vaguery was unintentional and
that he did, indeed, know that Dr. Rusynyk had visited and investi-
gated some mental retardation center dental programs and that, in
fact. reports had been submitted.

I also called you this day, October 3, l978, at l:3O P.M.
and left a message for you to return my call, but you did not.

On Friday, October 6, l978, fifteen (l5) days after our
meeting, I called and spoke with you. You told me that you had se-
cured Secretary Colautti's approval to set up a peer review to be
conducted by the Department of Health and that you would send a memo

to Dr. Wallace canzy the golzouiwg wee“ telling him to go ahead
with the investigation. It was during this call that I told you
of my contacts with Ilene Shane of the University of Pittsburgh,
Developmental Disabilities Law Project; Peggy Krash of the
Developmental Disabilities Advocacy Network; Doug Spencer of

P.A.R.C.;and Dr. Larry Coffee, Executive Director of the National
Foundation of Dentistry for the Handicapped.

Immediately after our conversation 
and told him that the memo okaying the inves

On Tuesday, October l0, 1978, I called Dr. Wallace again.
He had not yet received the memo and had still not formulated any
plans as to who would conduct the survey.

On Friday, October 13, l978, I tried to reach Dr. Wallace
again; however, he was out of the office for the day. I then called
Mr. Elser, who told me he was just finishing the memo to Dr. Wallace,
which was to be signed by you and Mr. Thompson, giving him the
authority to initiate a peer review. This was the same memo that
you told me, during our October 6 phone call, would be going out
early the following week.

On October 19, 1978, I called Dr. Wallace to see if he had
received the memo. He said he had not and that until he gets some-
thing in writing, he's sitting tight. I then called you, and you
told me that the memo would be going out within the next two days.

' On Friday, October 20, 1978, you called me and told me
that the memo would be going to Dr. Wallace that afternoon authoriz-
ing him to put together a conmittee to investigate the dental pro-
grams at Cresson and Ebensburg and make specific recommendations to
the Department of Public Welfare.

On Tuesday, October 24, l978, I called Dr. Wallace. He
told me that he had received the memo the day before (four weeks
after his meeting with you and two weeks after you told me he would
be getting it). He said he would be the coordinator for the peer

review team and he would contract the Pennsylvania Dental Associa-
tion for assistance. He also told me that "by late November or
the first of December, the team would be making its visits to the
centers".

The long, slow process continues to drag on, but a loose-
ly defined date of the end of November or the first of December has
been declared by Dr. Wallace. “

I believe all of my actions up to the present and what I
plan for the future are being conducted in good faith. My purpose
is to help the mentally retarded institutionalized residents of our
state achieve optimum oral health. For a year I have tried very
patiently to work within the system. I believe I have given you
sufficient time and cooperation to "clean up your own house". The
time for definitive action is drawing near. The history of the
situation, which can be amply documented, speaks for itself. In
good conscience. I can no longer tolerate inaction and bureaucratic
stalling. The deadline for the investigation will be December 8,
1978, and the reports must be available by January 5, I979.

I remain respectfully,
