and it is ldaicrous to contemplate reductions in staff and programs, which are
marginal at best, to provide these funds.

when we visited your Office, we had hoped for a full commitment from your Depart-
ment to undertake immediate remedial action as well as to provide intermediate

and long-range planning to fully correct past and present deficiencies. we were
acutely disappointed in your unwillingness to address the problem at that time,
but now that all the studies are in, there is no reason why prompt action cannot

be taken. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth, through your Department,
to provide humane care. It is therefore your responsibility to inmediately address
this problem. ’

we would appreciate your response by January 12 as to what steps will be taken by
DPW to bring immediate relief.

Very truly yours,
