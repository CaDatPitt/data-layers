Dear Governor Shapp:

We are aware of the situation which has developed recently at Polk
State School,and it was discussed by our Executive Comittee yesterday.
Without commenting at all about the process by which this situation was

- handled by the Department of Public Welfare, we want to express our complete

agreement with the view that restraints such as the pens and cages used at
Polk are incompatible with modern and humane treatment methods and should
be forbidden at all institutions for the mentally disabled.

There is no evidence whatever that mentally disabled persons are more
inclined toward assaultive or violent behavior than are any other persons
or groups.

Furthermore, we think that the use of such restraints illustrates the
need for continuing public awareness and for action with respect to the
conditions in Pennsylvania's institutions.

Staff must be attuned to humane treatment and to the primary goal of
strengthening the individual patient's capacity to reenter society. A
custodial or "warehouse" approach is not acceptable.

PMH is categorically opposed to inhumane methods of care and to the
concept of permanent institutionalization of people. We urge you to ensure
that all institutional treatment be mandated to further the patient's earliest
release to a community facility and to support much needed development of
community services. ‘

Our major efforts are toward replacement of institutions by local
facilities or integrating them into comunity—based programs. So long as
institutions do exist we will not abandon our concern that humane and appropriate
care be afforded those who still remain within their walls. ‘
