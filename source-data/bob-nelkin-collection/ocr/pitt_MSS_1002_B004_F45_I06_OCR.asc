Polk State School and Hospital has
been charged with violating federal law
by censoring the mailof retarded resi-

dents and with prohibiting them from ‘

placing or receiving outside phone calls.
The charges were made by the state,

Welfare Department's Western Region

in a memo from Norman J. Taylor,
deputy secretary of the Pittsburgh-

it

in

says, as a regular policy of the institu-
tion. ~

“These actions are specifically pro-
hibited by . . . the Mental Health Mental

Retardation Act of 1966,” the memo
states.

The memo directs Dr..McClelland to
allow patients touse public pay phones,

, in booths, to make private uncensored
' phone calls and to read a resident's mail

based Regional Office, to Dr. James H. l

McClelland, superintendent of Polk in
Ven-ango County.

The memo, dated Feb. 9, was obtained

by the? Post-Gazette yesterday.

"Born INOOMING and outgoing mail
is “opened and censored,” the memo

‘ only in cases where the resident is un-

able to read it himself —— and then in
the resident’s presence.
Dr. McClelland has not replied to the

, memo. Yesterday, however, he told the

Post-Gazette his institution does not cen-
sor mail but he admitted opening en-
velopes addressed to residents because

. “money is often enclosed in the en-

velopes, along with directions ’(to the
residents) for its use.”

He also admitted placing - curbs on
phone use. He attributed this to an
inadequate switchboard system. He said

he hopes to install pay phones in the
near future.

W E L F A R E DEPARTMENT policy

says parents of retarded residents must

be informed that money is not to be

» mailed directly to residents unless the

resident has shown an ability to handle
money. i

Dr. McC1elland said more than $30,000
a year is received at Polk through resi-
dents’, presence. .

ail Censorship   czia rged at Polk

tardation, yesterday said he has checked
the six other interim care institutionsiin
the Western Region and found no evi-
dence of censorship or telephone restric-
tions. ,
Charles Peters, executive directorwof
the Allegheny chapter, Pennsylvania As-
sociation for Retarded Children, de-
clared: '
“It’s inconceivable to us that people
would not be given access to phones;
Telephone use should be part of the pro-
cess of helping a resident normalize.” _
The issue at Polk was triggered by a
complaint from the father of a retarded
girl who claimed he was temporarily
prevented from placing a call to 
daughter to tell her he would be unable
to visit her during a special celebration
at Polk. ’ ‘ ’
