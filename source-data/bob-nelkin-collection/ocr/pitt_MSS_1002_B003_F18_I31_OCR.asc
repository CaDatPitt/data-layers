REPORT ON VISIT TO WESTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL, JULY 5, I972

This report will deal generally with the program and supervision of children in two
of the Units at Western State School and Hospital, Pine #2 and #3. This report was
initiated because of a complaint by the parents of one of Pine's summer residents.
The report is made after a personal visit by this staff member. During that visit
(2 l/2 hours) I had a discussion with the doctor, nurse, social worker and unit
attendants for Pines #2 and #3.

Various indications lead to the conclusion that these Units are under-staffed, over-
crowded-and under-programmed. There are grave consequences. One is that the insti-
tution's program is less rehabilitative. western State becomes a human warehouse.
Another consequence, of our immediate concern, is that the children and teenagers
are more frequently bruised and injured.

As the parents said, the child was black and blue all over his body. The injuries
and bruises were, as the parents indicated, bruises of the nose, ear lobes, right
kneecap, left forearm; cuts, scratches or laceration of lower lip, upper left arm,
under left forearm, back of neck; mucus and/or blood on nose, chin, back of hands;
dirty face; dehydration; no socks or shoes; pants drying on him from previously
being wet. In addition, I saw a new four-inch scratch across his face, It was
bleeding.

Staffing

when we went to see Mike on Pine #3 (School Boys’ Unit) there was no supervisor in
the day-room where Mike was sleeping on a gym mat. There were several other children
playing or rocking on chairs. Two summer volunteers were in the bathroom, busily
toiletting and changing residents. Dr. Eldridge instructed them to supervise the
day-room while there were children around. I presume that the regular attendant was
in the sleeping area or dining hall with other Pine #3 residents.

The doctor, the nurse and the social worker indicated that the major problem on Pine
#2 (the Lincoln Unit) is under-staffing. At the time the incident occurred, there
were two attendants for the whole unit. When we visited the Unit today, there were
three attendants. The staff indicated that this is an inadequate staffing for any
unit, and particularly inadequate to supervise 43 profoundly/severely retarded and
hyper-active adolescent males.

Dr. Eldridge claimed that the present attendant staff is "good" -— in some cases,
"excellent".

ReporT on VisiT To WesTern STaTe School and Hospifal, July 5, I972 - Page 2

IT appears ThaT These Two uniTs are inadequaTely sTaffed. "Could such an incidenT re-
occur?" Children are always pushing, shoving, hiTTing and kicking oTher children.
Does This envircnmenT encourage children being hurT? One sTaff person indicaTed ThaT
43 hyper-acTive children are Too many To have in any area. "You could have a sTaff
person spaced every five feeT and noT be able To prevenT children from aTTacking
oThers." PrevenTive acTion is Taken in exTreme cases.

One young man, who consTanTly biTes oTher residenTs, was segregaTed in anoTher room

for oThers‘ safeTy. One young fellow had his hands Tied behind his back for his own
safeTy. All The oThers were allowed To freely move around The room. The nurse claimed
"Mike's 'baTTle scars‘ were minimal compared To whaT oTher children have incurred."

Programming

The majoriTy of The young men on Pine #2 (Lincoln UniT) were inacTive. Several indi-
viduals were sleeping, several were masTurbaTing. Several were wandering around The
day-room. All The oThers were siTTing or lying quieTly. No Two residenTs were play-
ing, Talking, or oTherwise inTeracTing. Periodically one of The aTTendanTs played
wiTh one of The residenTs.

The UniT aTTendanTs and social worker said all The children are involved in some pro-
gram aT leasT once during The week. None of The children on The UniT are involved in

a daily program;(i.e., school, Training, recreaTion, jobs). Only one worker is assigned
To Teach eaTing, dressing, and oTher daily skills. IT was noT possible To deTermine
exacTly how much programming each of These children geTs and wheTher iT meeTs Their
needs.

while I was on The UniT, There was only a Trace of consTrucTive acTiviTy -- no pro-
gramming aT all.

Conclusion

The visiT revealed noThing new or surprising. Needless To say, The siTuaTion screams
for correcTive acTion. More sTaff! More programming! Fewer residenTs!

This one incidenT alone is disTressing. BoTh parenTs and sTaff indicafe There are
many more. Many cause more serious harm.

ACC-PARC AcTion OpTlons

The sTaff hope and pray for ciTizen acTion. Weary of poor ciTizen success in The
pasT, employees expecT no relief.

The parenTs, WSSH parenTs group in parTicular, are growing more miliTanT. They wanT
more for Their kids and are beginning To make demands of WSSH TrusTees and D.P.W.
They could use a boosT from a Third parTy.

This leads us To The opTions available:
OpTion l - Do noThing. WaiT for oThers To acT. STaTe PARC or DPW.
OpTion ll - Tour of VlP's - Governor, legislaTors, welfare adminisTraTors
OpTion lll - Discussion w/ WSSH adminisTraTion. lnTernal remedy.
OpTion IV - Media exposé'- Similar To Willowbrook, PennhursT

OpTion V - |mmediaTe legal acTion - injuncTion
