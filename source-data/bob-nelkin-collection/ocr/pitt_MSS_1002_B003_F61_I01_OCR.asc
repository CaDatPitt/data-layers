Dear Secretary Colautti:

Our office is representing Howard 4I‘!, a 21 year old resident
of Western Center. On approximately June , 1978, Mr.
allegedly broke the leg of another resident, Dominic C
complaint of aggravated assault was filed against Mr. P with
Magistrate Tony Bartkus but he was never arraigned nor was further
action taken in the criminal case. At approximately 7:30 a.m. of
the day following the alleged incident Howard P was placed in
a quiet room at Western Center where he remaine until 2 p.m. on
June 5, 1978. Since June 5, 1978, Mr. P has spent his days
confined to the back area of the gameroo Pine III, without
contact with other residents and without participation in any
educational, or habilitative programs. From 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.,
each evening he is placed in a quiet room.

   
   

A

More than a month after Mr. Pmas first placed in isolation,
he was read his "rights" by Robert r, Ph.D., at which time
Mr. Imrgequested to see a lawyer. On July 24, 197 a lawyer
from an erican Civil Liberties Union visited Mr. [hand
agreed on behalf of the ACLU, to represent him in his e forts to

obtain an immediate release from his solitary confinement and to
obtain a more habilitative program.

  

Mr. #5 medical records reveal that his eight-week isolation
-is at the irection of the Superintendent of Western Center.
when this situation was brought to the Superintendent's attention,
she indicated that Mr. '5 status would continue unaltered
until he is transferred to a more appropriate facility.

The Legal Committee of the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the
ACLU has authorized that all appropriate steps be taken to vindicate
Mr. in this egregious violation of his constitutional and
statutory rights. Although we are prepared to take legal action
to resolve this matter, we presume that our goal of obtaining a
more habilitative environment for Mr. 1- is consistent with
