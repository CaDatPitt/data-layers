Attention: Mr; John McCartney

I am writing this letter in desperation. All my life I have been very
independent, but now I am begging for help.

Twenty~two years ago when I was five nths oregnent with my first
child, my husband, a veteran, Elmer Cﬁxaras killed in an auto-
mobile ecciéest. is a result of thl° s.eci o my system my son, Paul,
was born severely retarded, cerebral palsied, poor eyesight and with

petit mal epileesz (which is now pretty much unﬂer control through
medication}.

    

Several years ego Paul's name was sdﬂed to the waiting list at
Western beau: school at Cenonsburg, Pa. On February 18, this yeei.
I was taking Paul upstairs, when he fell back on me, crushing my left

leg. ﬁy husband rushed me to the hosgital where I was oseratee on est

remained until this past Thursiay. in the meantime, av :6 year old
Mother, who has a thyrcia condition, heart couditixi and Gleueagi is
rying ts cire for ?aul who must remain upstairs. Paul is about five-
foot eight inches tall and weighs about 173 ppunds end was even barf
for me to care for. my leg is in a cast from ankle to hi; and I can
do practically nothing and must remain downstairs.
we understedﬁ that all admissions to Xeetern State School are being
blocked by the Pennsylvania Association for Reierﬁeu Citisens. I
can't believe this to be legal . Surely in a case such as ours skies

W

certainly can qusliﬁy as an emergency something could an: shoal; be
dcne.. ﬂy family doctor T.D.L. Weaver and my surgeon Dr. %cLeugh1iu
woulﬁ be only too glad to veriiy the above facts end else the fi:t
they I can never again care for my son. It would have to be a perma-
neni placement. ‘

-Our family is a pr:ying.fan;7v and rivht now it is the nain this; thee
