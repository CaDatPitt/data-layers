Dear Friends,

I have an 18 year old son who requires 24 hour

a day supervision. The choices that we will face

in the future are not satisfactory. I can continue

to provide 24 hour a day supervision or I can commit
.him to an understaffed, overcrowded warehouse where

he will lead a bleak existence.

I don't like either choice. I'd like my son
to enjoy a humane existence and I'd like to be free
to live a normal life myself. I'd like him to live
close by so that I can watch out for problems and
make sure that he is in the kind of place where he
will continue to have a decent life even after the
family is gone.

on May 24, 110 parents met because they care,

too, about where their kids will live when they
(parents) die. We found out, during the meeting,
that there are parents whose sons and daughters
need a residential placement right 393! And there
is no place----no place----in Allegheny County for
these children and adults. And, unless we get in-
volved, there will be no place in our community
this year or years to come (when our need may be as
serious).

We, parents, sent a petition to Secretary of
Welfare, Frank Beal, asking him to meet with us.
Mr. Beal is responsible for the development of al-*
ternatives to institutions in the state. we plan
to share with Mr. Beal our present and future needs
and our concern that there is no place for our sons/
daughters to go. We will ask him when there will be
places available in our community._—

Mr. Beal has repeatedly expressed the state's
preference for mentally retarded citizens to live and
learn in their home community. rather than institutions.
Yet, Allegheny County received state funds to start only
one group home last year. Next year, the projection is

that Allegheny County will get zero. We don't understand
why!

we will meet with Mr. Beal at the Downtown Pittsburgh

‘Branch of the YWCA, 4th & Wood Streets, on Saturday

morning, June 26th, at 10:00 a.m. We hope you will come.
Please bring other parents and friends. Call and invite
your state legislators. Get up and tell your need -
whether your child is multiply handicapped or mildly

retarded - whether your need is immediate or far in the
future.

Don't miss this meeting! It will affect your son's/
daughter's future.
