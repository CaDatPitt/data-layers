The Honorab1e‘Milton J. Shapp
Governor of Pennsylvania

State Capitol Building
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17120

Dear Governor Shapp: ~~~»i;m
I have learned about the dismissal of Dr. James H. Mbclelland, Jr., as
superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital from our local newspaper
and from our local Affiliste in the area of the institution. From.my per-
sonal knowledge about Polk State School and Hosnital and our local Affiu
liate's collaboration with officials of the institution over a long period

of tine, we protest the autocratic manner of Dr. McClelland's dismissal,

I urge you to make an imediate investigation into the situation which,

from information thus far received, appears to be a very hasty and unfair

decision.
Sincerely yours,
Hugh W. Ranso
Executive Director
