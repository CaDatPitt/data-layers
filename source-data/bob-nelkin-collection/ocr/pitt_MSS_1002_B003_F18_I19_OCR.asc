For the last two years, the Superintendent has been taking

full advantage of all, Federal Emergency Employment,
Commonwealth Careers, etc., to hire former residents into
support categories." The positions that have been vacated

were converted to child care positions. As a result, seven

(7) child care positions have been added. This has resulted

in acute staff shortages in laundry,dietary, etc. etc., when the
temporary programs were terminated.

Via Allegheny County ARC (and at no cost to DPW), we~are

acquiring seven (7) foster grandparents with the possibility

of ten (10) more later. Again, this was done only by authorizing
overtime for the Western State School bus driver so the foster
grandparents can be transported. What do we do when the overtime
funds are gone???

Western State School depopulation:

If we could find a facility such as Penn Manor or Park Nursing Home, one
not needed for Polk Dispersal, we could move one hundred (100) plus total
care residents out and gain medical assistance we are now losing at Western
State School. How about all or part of Connellsville General Hospital??

Problems are finding a vendor and getting e ope ' .-

Total cost would be about $1.7 million with about fifty (55%) percent Federal
reimbursement.

Western state School advises that 50-75 high functioning individuals could

be moved into community living -— if appropriate sites were available.

Assuming funds were available, it might be possible to lease a total apartment
complex (you know how long it takes for the Department to lease anything), and
move the individuals in. This would go down hard with CLA in Harrisburg, but

it is the only way to do it quickly. As an alternative, we could put

the money in the Western State School budget and run a direct contract. If we
had a vendor and did not use Western Sﬁate School staff to run the complex,

we would keep up 14-20 positions. Cost of this would be about $750,000 annually
with no Federal reimbursement.

Capital Improvements:

As you know, since 1968, $7 million worth of new GSA construction is to occur
at Western State School. This offers no immediate relief. I recommend that,
due to inflation and additional needed repairs discovered at Western (Example:
$32,000 impounding dam fence, $95,000 to relocate power sources so we can
demolish old buildings, $1/4 million for new transformers), we use the

whole $10 million at Western State School.

Closing of Admissions:

This has been discussed. Closing of admissions will not provide any

immediate relief, but bankrupt DPW in terms of providing needed options

to the community. Besides people can always be court committed to Western
State, even with closed admissions. We should, however, reconsider the concept
of temporary summer placements.
