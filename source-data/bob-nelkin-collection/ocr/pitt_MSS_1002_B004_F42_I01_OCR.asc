the comparatively recent visit of Allegheny County_'S Base Service Units.

First’, let.-me say lthatthe ‘group of. people" that came ,. although large

manner towards the residents and. our staff. They are-a credit to Allegheny '

"They were adistinct‘ catalyst ‘for our staff as"they questioned entries .

zinthe records or lack of certain programs. The ex:’Lt~.interv'i.ew also served
as a very objective appraisal of what problems or concerns they had identi-
fied while they were here.. - ~ ~ ' ' . ' 7

 summary, the visit waslworthwhile  necessary  the person—to—
person contact should continue. Periodic visits to Polk should be an
integral part of a Base Service Unit's yearly routine. ' ' '
