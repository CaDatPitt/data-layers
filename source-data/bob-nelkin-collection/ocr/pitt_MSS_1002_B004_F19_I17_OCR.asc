media the action that was taken by the Seqg
retary of Health. As you knew, I have been
connected with Polk School going on 13 years
now, having my daughter Judy as a member of
that instituion. I could not be more pleased
with the efficiency, care, and allaround con-
ditions of Polk and the way you have admin-
istered the school. ' ,

I have also been through the school and
have seen the types you have to put up with.
I think it takes much more of an understand-
ing-of day—to-day life with all types of re-
tardation than the Secretary could possibly
have, to have taken such an abrupt action.As
for dehumanizing patients, I myself saw what
could hardly be called humans at all, mere
vegetables, abandoned, forgotten by the world,
and then unceremoniously dumped on the door-
step of Polk. 7
Just what alternative does the Secretary
have to contain certain individuals, protect
them
seen
that it comes through your adminintrarion. In
all the years Judy has been with you, there
never has been a time that I doubted that she
was getting the best care available at all
times;

from violence from others etc.? I have
the dedication of the personnel and know

. I think the action taken by the Secretary
has been most unfair and wish I were in a
‘better position to appeal to the Higher-Ups
to immediately rescind yesterday's order.
If this letter can be used to better your
cause in any way, please feel free to use it.
‘If there is any other way I can help you,

please call on me at any time. I think you

have done a tremendous job at Polk, and I for
A one, am very grateful.
I Yours Sincerely,
