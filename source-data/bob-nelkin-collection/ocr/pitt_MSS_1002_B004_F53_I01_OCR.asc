Dear Mr . Cohen :

On June 1, 1983, I spoke with Brian Baxter about extreme
concerns following a recent visit to Highland Park Center, an
Intermediate Care Facility for mentally retarded people here in
Pittsburgh. I enclose a report on that visit and several docu-
ments pertinent to our continued findings of client-abusive
situations at state-funded facilities for retarded persons.

During.our visit to Highland Park Center, on May 27, 1983,»
we were given an animal prod that was used in aversive "therapy"
for several severely handicapped clients of the Center.

In addition, we were told that seventy-one (7l)' of the one
hundred thirty-two (132) clients of the Center are on some type
of maladaptive behavior program, including physical‘ restraints '
and time out. The Highland Park Center Human Rights Committee
is an internal staff committee with one parent representative.

ARC considered going public with our strong feelings about
this outrageously abusive treatment of.clients. We would prefer
that DPW immediately investigate these improprietiesand correct
the deficiencies at Highland Park Center of its own volition.

We request that DPW immediately take the following actions
to ensure the safety and well being of clients at Highland Park
Center: ‘ '

l.- . Form    to -look  -admitted practices
of aversive behavioral techniques at the Center. We under--
stand that Erik Wittman has been asked to head up such a team.

We do not think it appropriate to ask staff of Western Region OMR

to participate in this team, since our documents indicate Western
Regional OMR staff approval of aversive techniques including the
animal prod. The Comittee should have free reign to make and follow-
up specific recommendations for change at the facility.

2. Release the DPW audit of Highland Park Center that was completed

in the summer of 1982. Despite repeated requests, DPW has not released
an audit of Highland Park Center, prompted by allegations of impro-
prieties last year.

As you are aware, the situation at Highland Park Center is but an

example of serious problems and abusive situations throughout the Common-

wealth.

We urge you to work with the Department of Health to improve

the certification process so that retardation facilities will not violate.the
legal and human rights of clients.

In view of the Department's tacit approval of the electric shock

procedure, we expect your response and corrective action to begin immediately.

Sincerely,

77. {M
