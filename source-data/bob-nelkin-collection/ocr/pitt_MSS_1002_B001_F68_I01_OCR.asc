Dear Ed:

Norm Mulgrave has asked me to write. Thank you for the time you
gave us on Monday, October 23. All of us feel that such frank and
open conversations are extremely beneficial. Norm will attempt to
get ACC Board approval for the procedure discussed for any future
"Ridge Views" or "Mountaintops". Our next board meeting is on
November 21.

In the meantime our investigating team, under Ginny Thornburgh and
staffed by Bob Nelkin, will continue to visit facilities housing
Allegheny County residents.

There are a number of other matters that require our action. It is
our understanding that you will notify the appropriate county MH/MR
units and PARC of the names, addresses, etc., of any residents now
residing at White Haven who were transferred from Ridge View or
Mountaintop. The expectation is.that plans will be made by the
county units to return them to their home county or at least their
home region. PARC will also be notified so they may increase the
support of local Chapters to assist in the relocation of these
’children. To facilitate dispersal, we will begin preparing applica-
tions for group homes and will vigorously explore the possibility for
a foster home network. ‘ 1

You may recall that we discussed regional inspections in great
detail. We want to take this occasion to formally protest the fact
that a DPW employee heads these,regional teams and also that visits ‘
are announced. We feel these should all be surprise visits. A
consumer or at least a neutral staff person should head the team.
