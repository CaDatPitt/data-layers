Dear Dottie:

The ARC, Pennsylvania is continually_confronted with abuse and neglect
at the state's mental retardation units and centers.‘ I know from
visiting the institutions that it is almost impossible to eradicate,
but the ARC does believe that steps could be taken to prevent the
incidence of abuse. ‘” *“”

First and foremost, hiring practices must be improved. The Pennhurst
aide who was charged with assault last fall-was still serving a pro-

. bationary period for a previous assault conviction." While the ARC

» believes everyone is entitled to.a second chance, it should not be
at the expense of mentally retarded people. There are too many
positions at institutions which do not require direct contact with
the residents.

We also know from numerous conversations with other staff at Ebens-
burg that a few of the suspects in the rape case had questionable
backgrounds. An outsider involved in the_case was shocked by some
of the persons hired to care for clients. -

The state of our economy has produced an employer's market." There are
thousands of good people who desperately need jobs. And let's face
it, most of our institutions are located in rural areas where em-
ployment opportunities are few. The state center positions are valued
"since they pay decent salaries and have tremendous benefits packages.
There's no excuse for hiring anyone who is not well qualified.

In a February 10 letter to Jennifer Rowse, I demanded that mentally
retarded people be afforded the same protection prisoners receive.

I rage 4
My request was based on a gubernatorial ruling in January that mandated
psychological testing and a screening process for corrections officer

_ positions. (Enclosed is a copy of the release announcing this Civil

Service approved procedure.)

I received no written response from Dr. Howse on this issue, but was
told in a telephone conversation with her the week of March 28, that
the Civil Service Comission was looking into the employment guidelines
for hiring direct care staff and the Commission's decision was imminent.

I still have not had a definitive response on the hiring practices issue.

The ARC has been demanding improvements in employment practices at
Pennsylvania's state centers since l976,.but we have made no headway.
We believe that the Department should be embarrassed and angered by
these constant reports of abuse; enough so to take some precautionary
steps to stop it- The first step should be hiring the most capable,
compassionate and patient people to deal with our institutionalized

retarded citizens.

The ARC again urges the Department-to improve hiring practices by
following the same employment guidelines now'being used in prisons to‘
protect mentally retarded people in Pennsylvania institutions.

‘Thank you. May I hear from you soon.

Sincerely, ‘

Teddi Leiden, Chairperson
Residential Services Committee
