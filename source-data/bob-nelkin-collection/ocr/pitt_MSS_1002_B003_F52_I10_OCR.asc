Following is a list of immediate needs as determined by the
Intermediate Unit I to provide a more appropriate educational
program during the 74-75 school year. Included also are those
demands being made by the Teachers through the Pennsylvania
State Education Association which in many cases relate to the
Department of Public Welfare.

1. Seven additional full time teacher aides must be hired to
‘ ‘ %/provide coverage in all the structured classrooms.
2

. Eight part time teacher aides working from ll:00-2:30 are
eeded to provide additional assistance during this peak
1/aeriod which involves the feeding of many of the students and
followup care. ‘ ’ ‘

3. A Physical Therapist or two part—time Physical Therapist are
’ eeded during the school hours to relate to the needs of many of
Vgur students.

4. Janitorial services must be provided to all programming areas.
Some such areas are so dirty that it is questionable if they meet’

. health standards.

* S. ‘A prompt reply by a nurse when requested by the teacher to examin
a-child who looks ill and if found to be ill an immediate removal
from program for-medical attention.

6. ‘A need for students to be witheld from educational programming
when it has been determined that the child has a communicable
disease, ie, trench mouth etc.

7.. The students with acute diarrhea are not being witheld from
program or being removed from program. This greatly reduces program
time when several cases exist in the same class situation.

8. A student who previously received medication at noon is not
receiving that medication presently. ,Thus behavioral changes have
zbeen noted in some of the students and a change back to the
=previous practice may be warranted.

9. when a student becomes violent and/or destructive, being
dangerous to himself or others a nurse should observe and remove
from program to insure the safety of all involved.

10. Heating problems are evident in both the units and the outlying
educational program areas. There is very poor ventilation on the
units and thermostatic controls are not adequate in Evergreen, etc.

11.’ A need exists to utilize all available space on the units
including the bedroom areas to program children.
