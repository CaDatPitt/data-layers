POLK SUPERINTENDENT FIRED

Secretary of Public Welfare Helene Wohlgemuth today fired
Dr. James H. Mcclelland, Superintendent of Folk State School and
Hospital for the mentally retarded, Venango Co., effective May 1st.
She designated Dr. Wesley D. White, superintendent of White Haven
State School and Hospital, Luzerne county, as acting superintendent
of Polk, effective immediately.

The dismissal followed an unannounced visit to Polk by

Mrs. Wohlgemuth on Saturday, April 14, 1973, accompanied by Mrs. Harry

I ”Clapp, President of PARC and Deputy Secretary Norman J. Taylor:

“In the Meadowside Building, in a women's day room, was a
cage made of wooden slats with a small door and a padlock. The cage
was about 5' x 5' x 5' and inside sitting on the floor was a woman,"

the Secretary said. "It is indefensible in this day and age that

human beings should be subjected to such degradation and dehumanization."

She continued, "In the men's ward, I saw men in ‘play pens‘; the pens
are also about 5‘ high, more a corral;in order that they not roam from

the building. A man sat in a large crib with a closed top so that he

lcould not stand-—there were three such cribs in a row in one men‘s ward.

This is the epitome of dehumanization. Had we found such conditions

_ O

in an interim care facility, we should have closed it on the spot."

In§a.letter, hand delivered to Mcclelland today, Mrs. Wohlge-

. muth listed the reasons for the action as:

”1., The cruel, degrading, and inhumane conditions which I

»__ . u ....... ...._

_ 2 -
personally observed during my visit on April 14,
:l973. This refers specifically to the locked "cagesV
and pens in which you authorized the confinement of
patients.

2.; Severe and chronic deficiencies with respect to the
proper training and orientation of professional and
non-professional staff in the appropriate care and
treatment of mentally retarded residents."

The Secretary pointed out that Dr. hcclelland was eligible

for retirement under the State employment system and had been offered

" the option to resign but refused.

"l think it's recognized that all of our state schools and
hospitals have problems of overcrowding and inadequate staff," said
the Secretary, "but none has seen fit to resort to methods like these.

I "Unfortunately, Polk is a large institution...one of the
largest. No matter how rapidly we move to reduce the patient popu-
lation, we are still going to be faced with tremendous problems. The
only immediate answer is to pravidea change in leadership, to assure
that the treatment and programs at Polk are quickly corrected," Mrs.
Wohlgemuth said. I

Mrs. Wohlgemuth said that Norman J. Taylor, Deputy Secretary,
western region, had delivered the letter to Mcclelland this morning
and was on hand at the hospital to supervise, and brief the staff.

Dr. White.will arrive tomorrow to begin a thorough study of Polk
policies and procedures, and to recommend and make changes in the
facility's operations. A team of experts will also be sent to the

facility to evaluate and recommend changes in structure, programming,

and staff training.

To alleviate understaffing, 629 additional personnel
have been addedhat Polk since the Shapp administration took office in
January, 1971. Under the provisions of Senate Bill 55, another 250
would be allocated.‘ '

"Unfortunately, institutions like Polk are so large that

' it is impossible to keep a constant check on the conditions that

exist. I have notified the superintendents of all of the department's
facilities that conditions such as these will not-be countenanced. I
will continue to make spot visits to the various institutions in the

state," Secretary Wohlgemuth said.
