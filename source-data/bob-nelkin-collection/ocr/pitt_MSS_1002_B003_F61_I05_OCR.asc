Nancy Tassone of Christy Park
received a Christmas present a week
. early this year. A few days ago,
’ , Joyce, her daughter by custody, took a

step . . . the first one in seven years.
i r Joyce once was "whole”. As a
beautiful nine-year-old child she en-
- ‘ Joyed all life’s luxuries. the ability to
« walk, talk, see, and laugh.
' , Today, at sixteen, Joyce is learning
‘to walk again and someday with help,
i she may even talk. She will always be
; handicapped but because of the Tas-
» sones she will always be loved. 
.~ "" Joyce ?"'ls a drownlng'.’vlctim.' On
’ July 30, 1970 Joyce died. . .ior three
L minutes. The red-haired girl was a

f Oiild Welfare ward and was enrolled
in a Red Cross swimming course.
aAlthou’gh imtructed to stay away
3 from the water's edge . . . Joyce fell
F in and within a few minutes her vital
; functiom stopped . . . for 180 seconds
. she was dead.
An ambulance staff revived and
- - ~ rushed her to Pittsburgh's North Pas-
savant Hospital. But Joyce had suf-
‘ fered severe brain damage.
' At one point of her hospital stay her
. EKG was entirely flat. She had no
speech whatsoever, vision was un-
paired 70 percent, and her coordina-
tion was poor. One staff nurse refer-
red to her as a vegetable.
She was transferred to Children’:
I Hospital for a short time and later to
the Home for Crippled Children, th
place where Mrs. Tassone found her.
‘fr "I specialize in nursing handicap-
ped children and had been working
there for a year. During that year, I
fell in love with Joyce. 1 could com-
municate with her. I was the only
_ one who could get her to take
medicine," Mrs. Tassone said.

The child's condition commanded
close attention. Everything had to be
-done for her and she had to be very
carefully monitored, Mrs. Tassone
stressed.

. One night. Mrs. Tassone came on
duty to learn that the Home could no

‘longer support Joyce. She was bur-

’denlng the staff and was to be trans-
ferred to. Western State School.

"Western State is the dead end.
They had given her up to die," Mrs.
Tassone claimed.

That very evening, the mother of
two and grandmother" of three,
decided slie wanted custody of Joyce.
She wanted a chance to give Joyce a

chance. She wanted to supply Joyce
with one-to-one care “in _her own
home." For this privilege she was wil-

. ling to give up her career.

But her request created fervor in _
legal circles. it had never been done
before. Never had a nurse been given
custody of a handicapped child. She
would be setting a precedent.

“Word of my requat traveled and

soon 29 other nurses asked for Joyce's ‘

custody," she explained.
After careful consideration of all
“applicants", the hospital hierarchy .

vehose~Mrs'.‘ Tassoneand legal cogs'*“
began to turn.

Virginia Thomburgh, president of
the Allegheny Chapter of the Pem-
sylvania Association for Retarded
Children, testified on her.behal_f
before Judge J. Cohill.

in her opinion “a placement of
anybody in Western State Schoolisnot
appropriate. .

'l\venty other institutions were con-

sidered for Joyce's transfer hut?
refused her because her biophysical

needs were so great they weren't staf-
fed to give proper care. Her fate was
in Judge Cohill's hands. She would

. either go to Western State School

(where Mrs. Tassone ahd others
believed she would die) or to the Tas-
sons who hoped to strengthen and
love her.

Dec. 23, M4 was the thirteen-year-
old's lucky day, the first day in her
new borne. the Tassone home.

Nrrﬁlt her='first Christmas with her

new family was much different than it
is this year. Joyce trembled at rumpl-
ing of wrapping paper; She was totally
immobile (all four limbs crippled)
and could barely see. But this year she
is already playing with bows on
packages. anxious for Sunday to ar-
rive so she can open them. . . them. . -
herself‘, Mrs. Tassone explained.

But her progress has been slow. For
the past three years Mrs. Tassone has
worked day-in and day-out with Joyce.
She's strengthened the child’: sight
through exercise with a flashlight and
she's prevented curvature of the spine
by exercising Joyce every day.

“The doctor told me that she would
develop curvature of the spine and
would have to have an operation. i
started to exercise her, every day,
every hour and within a year the
doctor said her progress was
remarkable and she wouldn't need the

operation,” the nurse noted.

Mrs. Tassone hasn't slept a whole
night in three years. She's up at least
twice a night to check Joyce. Because

'7 her swallowing reflexes are weak,
Joyce's susceptibility to choking is-

great. She has not and will not leave
Joyce with anyone. Her only free time
is from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. when Joyce
attends Mon-Valley School for Excep-
tional Qiildren.

Through Mrs. Tassone’s constant
vigil and effort and the school's train-
ing, Joyce's progress has been
remarkable. Although she is mentally
handicapped she now will heed com-
mands and has a grasp of colors and
shapes, according to Mrs. Tassone.

Mon-Yough Mental Health/Mental _'

Retardation, Child Welfare, and the
Home for Crippled Children have sup-
plied Joyce with medication and ex-

’ aminations and the Tassones with ad-

vice and encouragement.

“'l‘hese years have been the most
rewarding of my 16 years of nursing.
We think and treat Joyce as our own.
My first dream was to see her walk
again, now my dream is to hear her

speak," the “dedicated mother" said

with optimism in her voice.

Doctors claim Joyce came this far

Ion “i'aith" and they cannot deter-

‘mine her full capabilities.
She is treated by her “family"’as
a normal child and Mrs. Tassone feels
. this is most important to her success.
~ “I think it's really what brought her
around. She understands commands

and likes to watch television

(especially Donnie and Marie Os-
mond), ride in a car and go out and eat
spaghetti,” she added.

Mrs. Tassone has great "faith"

that she will hear Joyce speak. She

-claims Joyce has called out in her
sleep and will someday talk in her
waking hours.

As a “parent by custody" to a hang’

dicapped child, she is willing to sharr
her knowledge, patience, ant
enthusiasm with other parents.

Mrs. Tassone’s untimate goal is ti
open a day care center in the area fo’
handicapped youngsters. Joyce will n-a_
doubt be her star pupil and mos
memorable Christmas joy.
