Chapzam Dear Norm:

Imﬂwgggiigngaizzg It has become apparent, over the last several months, that
crucial problems continue to mount at Western State School.
Complaints from parents, reports from on-site visits, and corres-
pondence which I have received, are more and more alarming. l
M‘sReCo}i‘:’:'1t§’V"’i‘(:‘:“It,’:;'Sf‘itdent am sure you are aware that the situation at Western is rapidly
hhslgolﬁvwl A moving to the point where it can be called critical. I discussed
Rﬁgonllvmepmﬁdmu the situation With Steu Brown and we suggest the following:
[””wVS'Be“3. _ ' l. That a Task Force be convened as soon as possible,
R£g0nHIVmePmmdﬂ" consisting of expert DPW personnel, D.E. personnel,
M’sl'{eJ;’i}c“’I“§‘\'/(\;/“i::“e";,reSident l.U. personnel, Western Staff, professional MR con-
Mrsﬁndrewschmidt sultants, representatives of the Western Board, the
R£dOn\,VmePwgdm“ western State Parents group, and representatives of
° _ local ARC's. This task force should be under the
Mriigfifgﬁﬁ/‘?i;l:1:P_esident leadership of one full-time staff member from OMR
° ‘ i with other OMR staff to be provided on the basis of
need.

Pm3rPjkmoni That this task force be given specific goals including
Exanuwelﬁnwnn identifying problem areas, recomending actions to
be taken to solve these problems, and identifying
resources needed to assist in the solution of these
problems.

That the report of the task force be submitted
within six weeks.

That the report of the task force be both goal
and time specific.

That nationally recognized consultants in institu-
tional problems and reform be hired and asked to
come to Western for two or three days to observe
and make recommendations for action to the Task
Force immediately.
