‘ }IARRISBURG—'l‘hc association of State Mental Hospital
Physician's has called for the reinstatement of Dr. James
Meclelland as superintendent of the Polk State School and

Hospital.

Meanwhile Welfare Secretary Helen Wohlgemuth issued

an order banning the use of
“locked cages or pens" for
the incarceration of residents"
at all other state institutions

‘ under her control or supervi-

sion. These institutions house
some 40.000 residents.

The use of five feet by five
feet by five feet pens at Polk
led to the firing last week of
Dr. Mcclelland. Mrs. \\'oiilge-
muth‘ said she first saw the
pens in use at Polk during a
surprise visit to the Venango
County institution April 14.

The -mental hospital physi-
cians adopted a resolution sup-
porting Dr. .\IcCelland at a
meeting here. The organiza-
tion asked tor a “complete

' impartial investigation of the

case.” V
THE RESOLUTION, sent to

 
  
  
 

.that Dr. Mccelland permitted
“cruel, degrading and inhu-
mane conditons at Polk are
dcfamiiig of his known charac-
ter, his personal and profes-

‘sional integrity, his well docu-
mented actions in his love and -

care of the retarded patients,
and are in fact without sub-
s "tl‘lC8."

duced by Dr. Albert G. Roode
of the Polk staff. It was
assed unanimously.

In her directive "to top wel- .
fare department 0 i f i c i a ls, :

Mrs. Wohlgcmuth said she
did not want the pens used in
any institutions for which the
department has operational,
licensing, approval or supervi-
sory powers.

There may be areas in
. which the care of the patients
could be improved. Howevcr,,
. it would seem to me that one
visit by Mrs. Wohlgemuth -is -
5C3I’CC1Y enough to warrant
" such an upheaval.
' Care of the very retarded is
a _\'ery'spccialized procedure.
Might I suggest that Mrs.
Wohlgemuth spend one week
‘as an attendant in the ward
for very retarded persons be-
fore she makes such an im- "
portant decision. ‘
