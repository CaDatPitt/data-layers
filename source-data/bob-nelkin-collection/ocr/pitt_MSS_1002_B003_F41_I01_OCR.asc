There has been considerable speculation concerning the unrest at Western
State School and Hospital in Canonsburg. For one week key members of my
staff, appropriate people from the Central Office and I have kept the
lines of communication open between the union leadership, hospital
management and ourselves. .

We are all rightly concerned about any conditions at Western that would
create a climate unsafe for our residents and staff. Therefore, we have
moved with all due haste to explore the problem areas and have come to
an agreement as to how we might relieve the conditions which cause the
unrest.

In a two hour meeting Saturday afternoon (May 3, 1975), the uion
leadership did not only give their word that they will not condone any
strike action on the part of their membership, but that they will con-
tinue to seek, along with us, to find out where such unfounded rumors
started. Training sessions to assist staff in working more appropriately
with the very few residents who are suffering from unusual behavior
problems will begin on Monday, May S, and will continue for three weeks.
Following the training sessions, the identified patients will be placed
in a separate area where their program will be structured to meet their
need.

I notified the Acting Superintendent, Dr. Ruth Scott last week that she
had our approval to hire additional personnel imediately to replace the
personnel that we will draw from other areas to begin the training
program. Already we have 22 persons who have volunteered to work in the
newly constituted area and would further encourage interested staff to
apply for the training if they would like to work in the area.

Concerned parents should know that the Regional office staff and the
union leadership are pleased that we have begun to jointly work toward
a problem solution, as the health, welfare and safety of the residents
and staff are our prime concern.
