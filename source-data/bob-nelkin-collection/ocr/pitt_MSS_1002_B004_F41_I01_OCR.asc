RE: Recent death at Polk

The Franklin Paper contained a very small article
regarding the death of Carl Fisher. Also, Diane Philips
from the state office called with some information she was
able to gather re the death.

Carl was 64 years old and moderately retarded.
About 1:30 p.m., Monday afternoon, April 14th, it was
noticed that he was missing from his residence in Hillcrest
Cottage. He did not return there after lunch. Polk staff,
Polk security and eventually the state police joined in the
search for him. He was found at 2:30 p.m., Tuesday, April
15th, lying face down in a marshy area either on or near
the school grounds. An autopsy was performed by Dr. Griffen
at Franklin Hospital. Complete results are not yet in. The
preliminary indications are that he suffered a heart attack.

Diane Philips and Marlene Burda are going to pay
an unannounced visit to Polk on Friday, April 25th.

I would like either or both of you to follow up

on this to determine if any action should be taken by us.
Call Diane if you secure any additional information.
