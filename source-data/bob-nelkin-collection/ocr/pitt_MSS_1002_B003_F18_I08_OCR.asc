confess that it came as no surprise to me. —:w

i" As a parent, and a candid person, I disagree
that I should have at least contacted the other
Trustees regarding the Boardls decision to support
the administration in handling this offense in the
form of a reprimand. Had I been present, I would
not have voted with you. I am weary of people being
regarded for simply doing their job. Don't we ex-
pect employees to act with responsibility and obli-
gation to others? Agreed that a reprimand is
strong - but the negligence in this instance was,
to parents, inexcusable. (Incidentally, last spring,
I brought considerable quantities of cosmetics to
this employee, to be distributed, particularly to
women being trained to go out into the community.

At the time of the candy incident, the cosmetics
were still sitting in that store room. Was she
going to let another six months pass before distri-
buting them?) - « . < ‘ «

‘I feel that, at this time, I must tell you how
Iahonestly feel about the administration and some of
our staff at WSSH. There is no way I can couch these
words to make them pleasant. .It is always the
parent’s group or the advocacy group who raises V
questions and brings serious matters to the attention
of the public.. Where are the voices that parents
wish to hear, demanding of the Governor and Secretary
that they be given help to provide_proper care for
our people. Why is the parent or’advocacy group
always acting as the capitalist for change.

..I disagree that the wrong person was whipped. ‘The
average citizen has little or no knowledge of retardation,
and what he has has been brought to their attention by
advocacy groups such as PARC or ACC-PARC. I think a
Board has an obligation to inform the public as much as
possible, not to quietly settle matters in a Board meeting.
Those in.a position to better the lives of institutionalized

‘persons have a great responsibility because they have seen

the true picture- »Who knew about the concentration camp
known as Hillcrest, later as Ridge View, until I opened
my mouth. Had I not done my job, how many other Louis
Novaks would have died, and would this citizenry have
known how our people were being treated? I think not.'.? H,
In many of these instances, our public officials are ' ‘Vi;

 

 

to blame and it is you and I who must lean on them until _‘Qf5Qi§l

they act responsibly- I know of no Board of Trustees
who has ever gone in righteous indignation to confronti
our elected and appointed officials. AI believe I made
this recommendation at the October Board meeting.

 

Frankly,-Joe, I am tired of working to try to make
paid staff to do their job. They might say that they
do all they can, but I disagree. I often think the
line of least resistance is taken.’ The latest reportf
of the conditions concerning the dietary problems are >
shocking. Will Mr._John Doe, citizen, be appraised
of this, likely not, unless the parent's group or ACC
makes-it known to him. I, too, am trapped in a lousy
system, with a child living in a place I find offensive
to God and man, but I will never rest until I have done
all I am able to do.

I respect the Trustees at WSSH and do not wish to
alienate myself from them, but I ask all of you that
you return this respect to me and know that when I
raise my voice, I do so as a parent first, then citizen,
advocate, and taxpayer. This is not to suggest that I
care more than the rest of you, but quite simply, when
I am in disagreement I say so. That is my right and
obligation to retarded citizens. I'am willing to
share the blame, while I make every effort, as I see
it, to do what I think is the right thing for me to do.

With every good wish for a Happy New Year to you,’
and a better and happier future for our special people.

Love ,

Mrs. Jean Isherwood
