MENTAL
RETARDATION

The Department’s emphasis during the fis-
cal year in mental retardation programs con-
tinued to be on the expansion of services in the
community to enable mentally retarded in-
dividuals to live, work, and be a part of
community life.

Community Living
Arrangements (CLA)

First started in 1972, Pennsylvania’s
community living arrangements program has
made it possible for over 4,300 mentally re-
tarded people to live in group homes, apart-
ments and other residential settings. Almost
half of these people were formerly residents of
State Centers.

As of June 30, 1977, 2,338 individuals were
living in CLA settings. Another 1,900 had
moved through the program to more in-
dependent living situations in the community.

Funded in 1972 with $1.9 million of State
monies, the community living arrangements
program budget for 1976-77 was $15 million.

Increased emphasis was placed during the
year on establishing apartments and other
smaller, more home-like residential settings.
The number of apartments increased by 153
over the previous year to a total 568. The
number of group homes increased from 124 to

162.

Attention also focused on establishing
community living arrangements for persons
with multiple handicaps who need extra sup-
port in order to live independently.

Family Resource Services

Assisting in providing that support both to
mentally retarded people participating in the
CLA program and to families with mentally
retarded members living at home is the Fam-
ily Resource Services IFRSI program.

increased from $392,000 to $3 million.

Early Intervention

It is during the period before birth and the
first five years of life that the greatest po-
tential exists for the prevention and ameliora-
tion of handicapping conditions. During fis-
cal 1976-77, over 6,000 pre-school children
took part in 125 early intervention programs
throughout Pennsylvania.

Vocational Rehabilitation

One of the major needs of mentally retarded
persons is the opportunity for employment.
During the year, 5,790 persons participated in
150 vocational rehabilitation programs
including evaluation of interests and skills,
occupational training, personal work adjust-
ment training, and job placement.

Statewide standards for sheltered work-
shops were adopted in June and a new pro-
gram of regular inspections and evaluation of
work-training facilities is now underway.

Other highlights of the year include:

——The number of residents in the State’s 10
mental retardation centers continued to de-
cline, falling to fewer than 8,000 persons by
the end of the fiscal year.

_ With a better than one-to-one staff-resident
ratio, it is more possible to provide individual
assessment of needs and treatment programs
for residents. Each Center is now preparing
an individualized treatment plan for each resi-
dent, including a projection for possible place-
ment in a community living setting and an
estimate of supportive services needed to en-
able the person to live in the community.

—Peter P. Polloni was appointed as De-
puty Secretary, effective March 28, 1977.

—Castle Creek was opened. It is a facility
in Franklin offering recreational and vo-
cational opportunities for residents of Polk
Center. This program allows Polk to extend
its programming for almost 150 residents
from the main campus into the surrounding
community.

—New regulations were promulgated
further safeguarding residents’ rights and
guarding against undue restraints and pro-
tecting against abuse.

—Through Project MAIN (Mobilizing
Attainment of Individual Needs), more than
200 direct service staff and 500 residents have
received training in the skills needed for ef-
fective community living arrangements pro-
grams. The project received recognition at the
American Association on Mental Deficiencies
Annual Meeting in New Orleans.

—The Fourth Annual Art Show was held in
the William Penn Memorial Museum
in Harrisburg in April 1977. More than 150
entries — all winners of local and regional art
shows for mentally retarded citizens through-
out Pennsylvania — were displayed.
