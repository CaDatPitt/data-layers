Dear Madam:

I am writing to protest your discharge of Dr. James H. Mcclelland as
Superintendent of Polk State Institution.

Dr. Mcclelland has been personally known to me for many, many years.
His father was a medical doctor in the Grove City community area for
many years and was most highly respected as is his entire family. Your
action in sumarily discharging him shows an inept attitude and the
resultant disturbance at the institution displayed your ignorance.

l am sure you would like to be well thought of by the medical profession
in the state and this action has not granted you this courtesy.

Very sincerely yours,

. /;»«—“T> y_ '
