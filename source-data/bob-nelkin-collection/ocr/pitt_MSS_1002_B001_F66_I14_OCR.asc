and the dispersal/{?'pendingn
On Saturday, November 18, you told The Pittsburgh Press that the
review guidance forms-for judging facilities were drawn up on short
notice to facilitate the quick establishment of task forces and that
you wouldbﬁreceptive to any recommendations in tightening up the review
process." The following recommendations are the result of the combined
efforts of staff and volunteers serving on the ACC-PARC Residential
Services Committee:
1. Eliminate the numerical rating system presently being used by
the evaluating committee.
Establish separate citizen/consumer inspection teams and state
teams. each with equal Department of Public Welfare consideration.
Both of these teams would report directly to the Regional Sec-
retary of Public Welfare. ,This would eliminate the existing
regional review committee.
The rationale for this would be:
--Elimination of internal political pressures on departmental inves-

tigating teams.

--Increased pressure for accurate and complete on-site inspection

reports.
