fear Prs. Uohlgemuth,

I am writing in regards to the firinv of Doctor fcclelland at folk State.

I feel that this was too severe and perhaps too hasty. It could be that

the information We receive thru the news media is rather limited.

I think perhaps the thing about this incident that upset me most was the

suggestion, credited to you, in the paper, that drugs should be used to

control these people. I am very much opposed to anyone su gesting pub-

lically that drugs offer a way of life for even these unfortunate creatures.
If I had a child like this, I would rather that it be as aware as it
physically could be to this world, yes, even from a "cage", than to live in

a world all alone made of drugs. ﬂy children, thank God, are all normal heal-

thy teenrgers and everyday they are bombarded with information that is
supnosed to cvnvince them that drugs are not the answer to anything of value

I feel this remark'was ill—advised and untinely. Since the opinions of

the public are usually not cansidered, solitions to the problem need not be

discussed with the newsfaners

Tell me, }rs.'Wohl3emuth, has anyone ever suggested that we start to drug

convicts to control them? Aren't they like these deople in that they may

not be left to their own devices‘. because they are not responsible?

I wish you peace and hope that all of your decisions will not result

in such uproar.

Sincerely,

I‘-irs. Henry A. Pearce, Jr.
