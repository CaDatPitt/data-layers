by the Court Master.

process.

-‘ 7 Provider proposals for 39 children have been
approved by the counties and the Master.

- l0 Sites have been approved by the counties and

the Master. A total of 24 sites is needed.

we believe that all children will be moved by June l980.
Many parents are reluctant to agree to moving their children during
the school year or until they have had an opportunity to see the actual
community site where their child will live.‘ ‘

Dr. Howse and the Pennhurst Implementation Team bring new
expertise to Pennsylvania. we should_see some acceleration of activity
over the next several months.

Responsible client movement takes a lot of planning, training,
parent counseling, and multiple approvals in a highly litigious
atmosphere. I will keep you apprised of our work over the next several
months. '
