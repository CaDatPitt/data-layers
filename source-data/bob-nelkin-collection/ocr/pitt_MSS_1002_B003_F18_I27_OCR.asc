Arwn Served

Wuutnrn State School and Hospital is the state institution
serving mentally retarded citizens from Allegheny and four
other counties.

?.«1-.'L.l.=‘.a._:':§..«__an. <1. _d;_r__<l:3.

western State is overcrowded and understaffed by all stan-
dards (Medical Assistance (M.A.); Joint Commission on Accre~
ditation of Hospitals (J.C.A.H.): Department of Public welfare
(D.P.W.); and Human decency (ACC~PARC).

Admissions
Admission requests are considered by a committee of Western
State employees. Requests must be presented by the base service

unit of the Mental Health/Mental Retardation system.

Most admissions to Western State are voluntary. Less than
5% have been court committed to the institution.

Population Trends

The current population and admissions‘ requests are continually
for less able persons. The present population has been labeled
1% borderline. 13% mild, 29% moderate, and 57% severely profound.

The current population and admissions‘ requests are continually
for more physically handicapped persons: 70% of the residents under
age 21 are physically handicapped; 64% of the residents over age
21 are physically handicapped. '

Avoiding Court Commitments

"western State administrator has worked closely with base
service units to fair1y.consider every admission request. Western
State employees believe that this approach has helped NH/MR under~
stand admissions criteria and conditions at Western State. The
superintendent feels that closing admissions will force base
service units to seek court commitments, destroying the criteria
now applied.

ACC~PARC & Parents Group Stand

The October 15, 1973 letter from the parents’ group president
(W.S.S.U.) reflects his opinion that admissions should be closed.
(Attached.)

ACC~PARC, the W.S.S.H. Board of Trustees, and the W.S.S.H;
parents‘ qroup approached lawyers in the-fall of 1973 to close
admissions at Western State. The legal action was never under?
taken.

The ENC-PARC Board supported the w.S.S.H. parents‘ group
resolutiunof last October 14, 1973. The resolution: (1) closing
admissions to w.S.S.H. total care units (2) transferring school
boys (spruce lodge, unit IV) to a cottage, using the space to
alleviatu overcrowding on total care units (3) DPW develop facili-
ties for Lotal care cases, and (4) the parents’ group support
the construction for a limited number of beds if the proper staff
was added. ACC~PARC Board passed a motion to support these de~
mands.

Medical Assistance Problems

The State of Pennsylvania fraudulently receives Medical
Assistance funds for Western state School and Hospital. One of
M.A.'s major requirements is no more than 28 persons on any of
those units; Most of the units are above 40 in population.
Residents numbered 29-40 have difficulty (do not receive) with
S.S.I. benefits because they are not in M.A. approved beds.,

Lack of Alternatives_

Alternative placements to Western State are almost non-existent.
Other State institutions with Allegheny County residents.want to-
transfer them closer to Pittsburgh. Private liscensed facilities
(Interim Care) are being required to reduce population to meet
regulations. Less than 10 group homes exist. only 25 foster homes
are available (suffering from inadequate reimbursement for foster
families). All these conditions increase the pressure at Western
State. ..

Temporary Admissions

western State has increased the number of temporary admissions.

Temporary admissions include respite care, summer program, and

time limited stays until an alternative is found. some temporary
admissions become long-term when base service units fail to move
residents out. Some of the 40-plus people on units are temporary
admissions. '

gnderstaffed

western State will obtain 45 additional staff positions soon.
This will still leave western 100 short of meeting J.C.A.H. staffing
requirements.|Often, because of absenteeism, only two attendants
are caring for residents on a unit. The staff can only perform
the minimal duties at this staff/resident ratio. '
