Coroner Farrell Jackson
County Court House
Washington, Pa. 15301

Dear Coroner Jackson:

A complete response to the acquisations which you have
forwarded to us would be much too long to read. Briefly,
the acquisation letter:

1) Exaggerates the aggressiveness or balance of Western
State School and Hospital residents. The few resi-
dents who exhibit these behaviors could certainly be
helped by behavior ahpin shaping programs. We believe
these few residents need a professionally structured
program and constant supervision and not a secure
facility (i.e., locked doors, restraints, and isola-
tion rooms) that the union requests.

2) In terms of the second acquisation about people being
prepared for the comunity who are not ready to be prepared,

this is slightly exaggerated also. Western State School and

â€˜Hospital has had the slowest grade of community placement of

any of the four state schools and hospitals in this area.
Western tends to be very cautious about sending people to the
community or placing them in programs on grounds to prepare
them for the community.

It's our guess that these few residents would behave
better in the community than they do at Western State School
and Hospital. The lack of consistency of numerous workers
that come in contact with each resident daily, the lack of
activity, the chaotic and restrictive nature of an institu-
tion are all causes of some of the aggressive behavior.

3) The acquisation that the Acting Superintendent invites
and listens to these "more aggressive residents tattling on

employees" is very hard to believe. Dr. Scott, who I have

a great deal of respect for, does have a good raport with

with the residents who live at Western State and does keep track
how some of the residents are doing by spending time with them
in her office or on the lodges. Employees should be grateful
that they finally have a superintendent who cares about the
people they care about, the residents.

As to the "volatile atmosphere of assaults, beatings, and
acquisations where no methods of restraint Exp or physical
protection exists", the situation is described in exaggerated
terms and we believe the use of restraints only furthers the
individual's stress and violates state and federal regulations
prohibiting the use of restraints except in emergency situations.

We certainly agree that.a critical shortage of staff still
exists. A reason for this is that the Department of Public
Welfare has failed to live up to the commitment of the legislature
in the number of positions that were allocated in November. Only

40 of the minimal 89 staff needed (child care aides) at WSSH

have been employed. Why the Department of Public Welfare has

not fully implemented the tentative legislative act, 75A, xkni

should be investigated. On the other hand, the absenteeism rate

at WSSH is extremely high. In other words, the workers make

it more difficult on their fellow workers by not showing up.
Concerning the charge of multiply handicapped individuals

not being able to get out in case of an emergency or fire

because they are above ground level in the Clinic Building,

we too would solicit your evaluation. This type of resident

has been living above ground level (not to the same extent)

since the inception of (Bob, you didn't finish this sentence

on the tape)
