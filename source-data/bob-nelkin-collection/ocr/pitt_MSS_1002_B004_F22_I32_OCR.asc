Dear Governor Shapp,

AP”;   'E:~7:‘2’"$
You have my support in the following: _,w ,
(1) advocacy of the graduated income tax , *YJJJg}
2) relief for the elderly he-ro.___mh,%,_
3) public assistance reform ‘“"“"”‘”‘
4) reform in the fields of insuance, milk price control, etc.
(5) recognition of the fact that morality cannot be legislated,‘
and opposition to the inhumane abortion passed by the Assembly
(6) attempts to provide education for and h cane treatment of

the mentally retanded.

On the other hand, I heartily disapprove of the methods émployed by the
Secretary of Welfare to displace Dr. James Mcclelland as superintendent
of Polk State School and Hospital. A _ '

I do not advocate the medical model. Anyone with a claim to humanity must
favor the rehabilitative model. Given the overcrowded conditions which
have existed at Polk almost since its opening, the medical model was the
only way to ensure the Physical health and well-being of the residents.
As a medical model, Polk has performed well, as attested by the increased‘
life expectancy of its population.

Regarding cruel and inhumane treatment, I am sure that "restraints" have
been used more than they should be in some cases, but the PARC inspectors
and Ms. Wolgemuth have failed to seriously investigate the "why" of such
‘restraints. "Fighting" may sound relatively trivial as a reason, but I have
seen the results of the "fighting" of aggressive rcsidcnts- broken bones,
cuts requiring stitches, missing earlobcs, etc. I have personally disengaged
the hands of a young male resident who for no apparent reason attacked
another resident who is extremely passive and offered_gg resistance to the
attempted strangulation. Volumes could be written to document the reasons
for restraints and/or tranquillizers.

The charge of inhumane treatment leveled against Dr. McClelland is particup
larly abhorrent and libelous to anyone who has worked under him. He has
talways had an "open door" policy to the residents in his chargB.He has en-
couraged and supported programs for.a;1 residents. His major crime in today's
society is the result of his empathy with both retardates and their families.
In trying to relieve the pressures put on such families and to protect the
retardates from the indifference and/or cruelty of the community in general,
he has perpetuated the need for the medical model. He does not deserve to

be labeled inhuane. ‘

I believe that you are a decent man, sincerely trying to effect social reform.
In the name of decency, please do not allow the stain of these charges to
stand on another decent man's record.

Respectfully,

_. / r _‘
