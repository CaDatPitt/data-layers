Dear lord,

This is to further our conversation at the Convention in which
you asked for my ideas Sor programs.

first, the transfer of 1,000 people tron Polk state School and
Hospital is a must. At this tine, it seees to me the best wey

to do that would be to return the Allegheny County residents to
facilities in or near Allegheny county. I specify this group
because there may be facility space available (Haroy?, Hbodville?,
uayview?. Direont?) and because the supportive services are better
developed. Assning this is achieved. we sight consider Allegheny
County residents of other state schools and oepitals.

There say be a method getting onhudeean into Polk and leetern
state school and Hospitals. 0e would be to pick one or more
young. gung—bo persons on Polk staff and assign them, on a tee-
porary basis, to western and vice versa. A preferable device

say be to contract with Allegheny county chapter to perform this
service. I suggest then because of their xperienoe and because
Alleghny county has more residents in state schools and Hospitals
than any other in the western Region. for eaanple. one in three
Polk patients are from Allegheny county.

norsan Taylor and I kicked around an idea that is woth exploring.
Why not take some areas of the 'oeepus' at Polk and leetern and
develop then as public parks? leintenanee could he performed,

for pay, by the students. one spin-oft would be to get the public
aware or the institutions.

on this subject. how about an appeal to church and social organi-
zations, or the military reserve. to construct a day-cam, or

even residential camp, or creative play yards on the grounds?

The last would be done using telephone poles. wire spools, tires,
etc., etc. Again, you have the plus of getting the public involved
with the institutions.

on the subject of getting the public in institutions, I think all
volunteer programs at State Schools and Hospitals muet be rethought
and revitalized. A roster Grandparent Program at both Polk and
Western State schoolsand Hospitals would be a real plus.

Because of the Polk furor, there is a tendency to focus on the
institutions and their improvement. clearly. something muat be
done, but our over-riding onoern must remain the removal of
people from institutions. Along these lines. foster homes for
both children and adults should be vigorously pursued. Possibly,
we might use interim-care money for this purpose. I would like to
do this on a region-wide basis. If necessary, we might go the
demonstration route. possibly with a program in a rural county.
urban county, and suburban county. we can probably anticipate
some probles from the child welfare people. At the County level,
you will have to work with, under. or around them. There should
be no problem with the an/Ha age o! 18.

Each State school and Hospital must be directed to establish a
co-ed pre-release. minimum supervision unit on campus. but as

far as possible fro the main campus. Renting of homes in Franklin
and canhgneburg will be explored. Bone eoonmio and capability
skills p us trial weekends in Pittsburgh should form te basis of
the program.

Also, a pre-release social worker should be assigned to meet

with parents of potential releases in their homes. The worker
also would establish parent discussion groups in communities
where a number of parents reside. The purpose would be to reduce
anxieties. The practice oz giving parents two weeke written
notice before release has to stop. with an annual cost or $10,000
at Western state school and Hospital. we only have to achieve

success with two cases that would have failed to make the transi-
tion to justify the worker economically.

A two- or three-day workshop should be held for child care and
other patient eomtact start at Polk state school and Hospital

and another at Iestern state school and Hospital. The purpose
would be to explain the principle of dispersal. advantage of com-
mnity living to the mentally retarded, and to ameliorate any V
anxiety about roesible threats to staff employﬁet 933! ¢1lPOr%31
of state Sohoo and Hospital patients.
