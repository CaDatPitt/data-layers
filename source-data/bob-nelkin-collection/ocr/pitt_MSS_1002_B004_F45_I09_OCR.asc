Commissioner of Mental Retardation
Department of Public Welfare

Dear Commissioner Goldman:

Several of our members have visited the Hamburg State
School and Hospital recently and the Residential Services Com-
mittee has asked me to write to you about our concern for the
mentally retarded persons living at that institution.

The Committee feels that in many cases, the residents
are not receiving treatment and training which they need due
to a shortage of both professional and direct care workers.
For example:

in the wards for women and adolescent girls, the
surroundings have been made more comfortable and
cheerful with the addition of colorful bedspreads,
drapes, sofas, chairs and tables in the dayroom.
However, all of these wards do not have adequate
dayroom space and the women and girls are en-
couraged to spend leisure time in the sleeping '
areas. There are no chairs in the bedroom section,
only beds and an occasional chest. None of these
wards had a staff person present at the time of
our visit. -

in a locked ward, boys were lying on the floor;
the base boards looked as though they had
been chewed and since the paint job looked very
old, I hope it was not lead paint. There were
a number of electrical outlets within reach of
the resident. At no time were there any male
aids present;

There was a startling lack of child care and
professional staff in the Total Care Areas.
women residents were working with these multi-
handicapped individuals. One “helper” had

changed the bed and completely covered the patients
head with the sheet. There was no nurse there at
that time. One resident was supposedly feeding
another but dropping more on the floor than she
was putting in the handicapped childs mouth.

Tiring of the whole business, the “helper” took

the plate to the nurse and said “she doesn't want
anymore”. The nurse said, “alright” and accepted
the half full dish.

Most of these residents have serious physical de-
fects, but Hamburg physical therapist staff con-
‘ sists of one unlicensed part-time therapist.

In the hospital there appears to be a similar
shortage of staff although Mr. Baumstein said
it is JCAH accreditted.

Dinner was being served at 3:30 p.m. Lack of
staff was given as the reason for the unusual
hours - breakfast at 7:00 a.m., lunch starting
at 9:hS a.m. and dinner starting at 3:00 p.m.

V Mr. Baumstein indicated that recruitment of non-
professional staff is no problem in the Hamburg area. we
urge you to hire immediately, as many child care workers

.and aids as are necessary to meet the care and development
needs of the residents at Hamburg State School and Hospital.

Additional professional staff, particularly those
skilled in working with mentally retarded persons having
gross physical involvement, must be recruited as soon as
possible.

It is essential that residents are not employed as
“helpers” on wards, unless they are properly trained and
under close supervision at all times.

The people working with the multi-handicapped appear
to be kind, hard-working and well motivated. Nevertheless,
it seems that many of these workers are not familiar with_
some of the newer methods of helping severely handicapped _
people. For example: '

the beds and residents were clean but there were

no stimulating or corrective devices in the crib _
areas - mobiles, bars for pulling, crawling board,
etc. Residents were seen being fed prone and
choking. '

There is not enough space for out of bed activity.
and little indication that these residents leave
the ward.

The Residential Services Committee believes that there
must be intensive individual programming for multi-handicapped
residents in order to promote their development and to prevent
unnecessary physical, intellectual and social deterioration.

we urge you to immediately take the necessary steps to

.institute an in-service training program using the multi-

disciplinary team approach for all personnel working with multi-
handicapped persons. ‘

we know that Hamburg could have very exciting programs.
You can be sure of our willingness to be of help.

Sincerely,

" 7
