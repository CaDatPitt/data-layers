Dear Mus. Thornburgh:

Thank you for your letter of'May 7. I am sorry I have not been able to ‘
respond to your request sooner. I understand it has been clarified for
you that the 23 positions were positions already available at Western
State School and.Hhspital-but were not filled. It seems the more serious
problem at Western is not hiring of additional staff but to find
appropriate placements for a number of residents who are now residing in
thattfacility.

It is my understanding that the in-service training program.is progress-
ing well at Western and that the new unit will be in operation aroud
May 27.

You did request that you have the opportunity to review with me the
specific plans for the unit and the process by which the residents would
be selected. Neither of these requests ;n; appropriate to my fuction.
The superintenéet and the staff of Western have the authority and the
responsibility to develop the specific plans for the unit and the process
by which the residents will be selected. If you would like to discuss
this matter with Dr. Scott I am sure that she will be agreeable to meet
with you.

I understand from Dr. Mhlgrave that eight residents have been.moved into
the Robinson Developmntal Center. I am pleased that they have become
operational and look forward to having the facility become fully
operational.

Please feel free to contact me at any time if there is something that I

can do on behalf of the mentally retarded. Your continued interest is
greatly a reciated.
