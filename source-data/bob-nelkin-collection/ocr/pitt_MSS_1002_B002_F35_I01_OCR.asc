AGREEMENT STRUCK IN PENNHURST CASE-—
STATE TO MONITOR PLACEMENTS

HARRISBURG (Feb. 9)--An agreement has been reached between the Department‘
of Public welfare and the-federal court—appointed Office of the Special Master
that increases the state's responsibilities for monitoring the placement of
Pennhurst residents in community facilities.

The Office of the Special Master was created by Judge Raymond Broderick
during the Pennhurst litigation to expedite the community placement of Pennhurst
residents. Questions about responsibility for monitoring the progress.and
quality of placement arose after that office was created.

“This represents the first successful attempt to negotiate a monitoring
agreement between the Department and the Special Master's Office,” said welfare
Secretary Helen B. 0'Bannon. "we are glad that our efforts over the past months
have finally paid off.”

Under the agreement, the state will begin in mid-March to monitor the
safety and progress of persons who have moved from Pennhurst to community
racilities. This will include reviews of community programs and the individual
habilitation plans for former Pennhurst residents -- activities carried out

previously by the Office of the Special Master under federal court order.
