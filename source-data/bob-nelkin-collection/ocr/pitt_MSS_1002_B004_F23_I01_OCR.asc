Polk EditorialLauded  

We have been watching with
dismay all the heat, con-
troversy, charges and threats
‘being made by some of the
supporters of the Superinten-
dent of Polk State School" and
dlospital for the retarded. Un-
«til the publication of your edi-
torial of April 24 in the Times
‘not very much has been said
about the residents of this in-
'stitution and the conditions un-
‘der which they are living. As
the parents of a daughter who
,'is a resident of Polk. my wife
-and I want to congratulate you
on this excellent editorial. The
facts set’ forth in the editorial
are all too true and society as
a whole and more especially
the parents _of the retarded
‘must accept the responsibility
ifor conditions as they exist
;.there.

We are acquainted with Dr.-

;McClelland and have on vari-
ous occasions consulted with

him on problems conceming

our daughter. We have always
found him friendly. consid-
erate and easy to talk to. But
we also know that the adminis-
tration of Governor Shapp has
been making more headway in
reducing the population of our
Jnstitutions for the mentally ill
and mentally retarded than
has occurred heretofore. We
also believe that Dr.
McClelland is entitled to a
hearing and that he will get
one: In the meantime. what
about the crowded conditions
at Polk and other state in-
stitutions for the retarded?

United Cerebral Palsy of
Northwestern Pennsylvania

has taken a positive stand on‘

the question of overcrowding

in our institutions for the re-
tarded and handicapped. On
the advice of our State and
National organization we have
submitted a proposal for a

Community Residence for the

substantially handicapped. We
were informed that there is
money available from HUD
for construction of such a fa-
cility. We submitted a propos-
al in two parts: for construc-
tion to MOCA; and for- funding
for the operation of the resi-
dence -— to the Office of Men-
tal Health-Mental .Retarda-
tion. We plan a two-unit resi-
dence consisting of 12 resi-
dents to each unit. We feel
that this is a good start in cut-
ting down the population of
state schools for the retarded
because we are required to
take one=third of our residents
from Polk. We would like to
point out that if every county

which Polk serves would do‘

this it would be a big help in
reducing the population.
United Cerebral Palsy of
Northwestern Pennsylvania
has received approval of their
proposal for a Community
Residence from Mr. Dan Hat-
ton.
Erie County and also from Mr.
Robert Vogt of the Meadville
Office of the Department of
Welfare. Western Region.
However. the Citizen’s Adviso-
ry Committee of Planned Vari-
ation has recommended to
MOCA that our proposal be
turned down on the grounds
that the cost is too high for the
number to be served.
