WSSH Grievance

Re: Edward 8
December I7, I973

We met with Dick Orlandi, social worker, at WSSH. At this meeting Mr. and

Mrs. Flowers told of their complaints and Mr. Orlandi and I narrowed them down
to 4 major questions. Then we met with Mr. Gallagher, the Director of the Social
Service Department, Mrs. Percara, the Director of the Nursing Department, and Dr.
Bradley, the Director of the Medical Department, Mrs. Buddemeier, the Pine nurse,
and Juanita Wilkinson, the Pine IV attendant.

(I) Did Dr. Hazlett give Edward mycoline after Dr. Chamovitz had reduced
and discontinued this medication? was mycoline having a negative
effect on Ed? Did the mycoline cause these episodes which are
considered seizures by the parents and acts by the staff?

By reviewing the medication chart it was obvious that Dr. Hazlett had reduced
the mycoline in October and discontinued the mycoline in November. Only after the

grand mal seizure on I2/I2/73, did Dr. Hazlett reorder mycoline. Obviously, the
mycoline did cause these episodes.

(2) Are Ed's spells seizures or an act? Is there any possibility that they
are seizures? If they are not seizures, what is the cause? If they are
not seizures, how should the staff react to Ed?

Dr. Bradley stated it is a fact the EEG indicates a seizure pattern. However,
Mrs. Percara told of an example when Ed was in these seizures, when he snapped out

and gave orders which made sence during the seizure. Such behavior, she contended,
would be inconslstant with the seizure.

Mrs. Percara and Dr. Bradley agreed to study Ed's behavior prior to, during
and after the episodes and record them and to review them with Dr. Chamovitz.

(3) Did Rich rough up, beat up, or rm Ed g If he didn't, why would
various residents state that he did? as ere a reason for the physical

contact?

I interviewed Ed and it was clear to me that he had been touched by Rich Gullich.
It was not clear, however, what was the cause of the incident or the nature. It was

agreed that Dick Orlandi would interview separately one or two of the residents and
gather his own opinion.
