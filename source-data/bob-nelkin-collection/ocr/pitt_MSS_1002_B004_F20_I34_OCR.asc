Harrisburg, Pa. 17101

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:

I would like to begin this letter by introducing myself.
I'm a Thiel College student who has worked the past three summers
(1970, 1971,1972) at Polk State School and Hospital as a
Child Care Aid Trainee. I consider myself one of the more liberal
citizens of Pennsylvania. -

Next I would like to give you a short history of what I have
seen at Polk. My first day on the job was quite an experience.
As a mtter-of-fact, I had much the same reaction as I believe you
have had. I wasn't able to eat for two weeks. Gradually I became
accustomed to the slovenly conditions, but my family suffered.

A Periods of depression became my life style.

. I begin to notice quite a few items which I'll list and which
I think you should at least consider:
1.) ‘Not only was the work degrading ( Washing dirty
diapers for adults is slightly different then washing the soiled
diaper of a child.), but the people I worked with were miserable.

_ 2.) The average Polk attendant must weigh about 180lbs.,
have at least 2 children to go home to take care of after keeping
track of 50 or more patients all day, could , more than likely,be
a divorcee, or may be older and physical incapable of handling her
job.

3.) The younger girl is very capable, but spends the
majority of her day sweeping, getting out laundry, serving meals,
finding that she gets frowned upon if she does too much work.

h.) Work weeks are in seven and eight day shifts and
by the fifuiday not too many employees are capable of working with
any type of child, let alone meirfellow employees.

5.) The person who applies to Polk usually does so out
of desperation.

6.) Not only is Polk's superintendent outdated but
so are its workers and its buildings.

I, personally, don't know Dr. James Mcclelland. I'm only
a nothing at Polk, but I would still like to congratulate you at
this time when you're probably asking yourself "Did I do the
right thing." There are protest, but consider by whom-- Polk

patients who don't even realize the conditions under which they live
and Polk employees who are afraid of revision and of being discovered
for what they are. '

I only have one comment on the entire episode. Don't stop
now. It'll take more than a single woman to bring the necessary
reforms to Polk. I have mentioned only a few items. It takes
more than just a days visit to discover the fault.

If you have any questions you wish to ask of just an interested
citizen, I'll be glad to help. -

Sincerely,

A former Meadowside employee
and
concerned citizen,

Mrs. Ann $eeley Johnson
