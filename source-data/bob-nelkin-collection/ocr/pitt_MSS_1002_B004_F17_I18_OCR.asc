Dear Ms Wohlgemuth,

I am.writing in protest of your recent publicity seeking and uncalled for

action in the firing of Dr. James H. Mcclelland as Superintendent and Adminis-_
trator of the Polk State School and Hospital. As a former pastor in Franklin,
Pa. and a regular visitor at the Polk State School, I was able to see first
hand the accomplishments which Dr. McClelland brought abbut during the years
he gave of himself at Polk. Now as a member of the Board of Directors of the
Westmoreland County Association for Retarded Children, it grieves me deeply
to see the spiteful action you have have taken against Dr. McClelland,perhaps
.at the instigation of our own state association officers.

It is quite plain that you have taken this unjust action, without the benefit
of a hearing, in order to remove some of the criticism that has been placed on
your office for past failures and neglect of your responsibilities concerning

. the retarded children and adults of our state.
I urge you to reconsider your hasty action in the firing of Dr. Mcclelland.

S;:.‘i%?(§”/*3?°°‘/
