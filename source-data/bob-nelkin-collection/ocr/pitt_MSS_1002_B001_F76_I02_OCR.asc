If you are a parent or other interested person in Allegheny County who:

(1) is concerned about the availability and the quality of educational
opportunities for people who are mentally retarded, and

(2) is interested in working for the improvement and expansion of ex-

isting educational programs for individuals who are mentally re-
tarded,

   

then you might be interested in the ACC-PARC Education Committee.

  

This ACC Board Committee has the responsibility to promote and monitor the
educational opportunities available to mentally handicapped citizens. The ration-
ale for this function has developed from the belief that quality education depends
upon the involvement of interested people (parents and other concerned comunity

members), outside of what we have traditionally defined as the education estab-
lishment.

  

Participation in this Committee will allow you to interact with other per-
sons interested in the development of appropriate education experiences for people
who are mentally retarded. You will reflect ideas, produce resolutions and devel-
op strategies, all designed to improve the quality and the availability of educa-
tion for mentally retarded individuals. Your committee involvement will include
one meeting per month, but your level of activity within the sub-committee and

special project groups can be governed by your interest, time and desire to parti-
,cipate. ‘

 
  

Some of these activities might include: visiting existing programs; meeting
with school directors, administrators, teachers and parents to discuss existing

and needed services; working on inter-agency task forces concerned with education
issues; reviewing laws, regulations, standards and policies that affect the educa-
tion of individuals who are mentally retarded; making recommendations to the ACC-
PARC Board of Directors for the development of agency policy.

  

Remember, as a member of the Allegheny County community, you are in many ways
a consumer of the educational programs available. If you are concerned about these
services, one avenue of involvement that might be of interest to you is the ACC-
PARC Education Committee. '

If you would like more information, or if you are interested in serving as a
volunteer on this Committee, contact Bill Casile at the Chapter office.

The Hampton Unit of Hope Corps Council moved into action when

t ey ear t at res ents rom the Highland Park Center could
not attend a Youth-PARC sponsored dance at the Airport Sheraton
Inn because they lacked transportation. An open plea to all
the students at Hampton High School brought in nickles and
dimes .. whatever change the students had in their pockets that
day... that amounted to the $70 needed to rent a bus. Quick
thinking and the spontaneous response of many young people al-
lowed those at Highland Park to have a Saturday night "get to-
gether" that will be long remembered.

The Western State Unit of Hope Corps Council is once again coor-
dinating the Bike-Hike at Three Rivers Stadium. They will be man-
ning check-points from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and invite any
Youth-PARC members or friends who want to join them to call Nancy
Daily at 276-3868. Have fun - get involved!

We have been informed that the Pamper Division of Procter and Gam-
ble is considering the manufacture of heavy-duty disposable dia-

mine the extent of interest in this product and its potential use.
A supplier in New Jersey has expressed willingness to bring the
product into this area if there is sufficient demand.

If you would be interested in purchasing heavy-duty disposable
diapers in large sizes if this product were to be manufactured,
write to the following two addresses and tell them so. Describe
the sizes that would be most convenient and estimate how many
would be used each month. Write to:

Did you receive the recent Annual Enrollment mailing concerning
the special insurance plan available from NARC? If not, or if
you've delayed taking advantage of it, here's an easy way to get
information about this unique protection. You may call the Pro-
tection Plan administrators free on their national telephone line.
Just dial 1-800-237-7771 and ask for Pat. The administrators
will answer any questions you may have and send you materials ex-
plaining the plan if you wish. If you prefer to write, the ad-
dress is: NARC Protection Plan, P.0.Box 18384, Tampa, Florida
33679.

The Protection Plan is special insurance protection arranged by
the NARC at much lower than normal rates. It's available only to
NARC members and provides coverage up to $50,000 without a health
examination. It's designed to solve the problem of member par-
ents‘ greater need of life insurance protection for their familes.

The South Hills Area Developmental Center had a compliment right

before Christmas. The children were waiting to ride the train

at South Hills Village, and the woman running the train told Jo-

Ann, the teacher, that it cost 15 cents a child. There was some

grumbling among the adults because the children had always ridden
the train free.

Finally the woman came over to explain that she was sorry but on-
ly retarded or handicapped children could ride the train free.
She looked surprised when told the children were retarded. It
was almost worth paying to ride the train. Three cheers for
normalization!

ACC-PARC's Down's Syndrome Group schedules education meetings two
or three times a year to teach parents and professionals more
about Down's Syndrome (formerly called "mongolism"). For in-
formation concerning the Group's activities, call Sue Vandervort,
322-6008.

Southwest Habilitation Center is gathering items to furnish a
"practice" apartment as a part of their independent living skills
program. They would appreciate donations of useable kitchen ap-
pliances and utensils, household items, etc. Items may be taken
directly to the Center, Bengs Building, Bridgeville, or may be
brought to the ACC-PARC office, 1001 Brighton Road, North Side.

ACC staff members are enthusiastic about new summer programs for
adults who are mentally retarded that will be implemented this
year on a trial basis. They hope to obtain donations of camping
and fishing equipment to begin the program. If it proves suc-
cessful, the program will be expanded in the future and hopefully
equipment could be purchased at that time. But for this year,

it is hoped ACC members will respond to this appeal with their
customary generosity and will donate useable camping equipment,
fishing tackle, zebbco rods and reels, bobbers, sinkers, hooks,
nets, stringers, etc.

Send or deliver equipment to the ACC office, 1001 Brighton Road,

iNorth Side, or call 322-6008 .. talk to Bob Kasten or Sarah Cook.

A LOVE STORY

In 1972 Sue was a staff member at Western State School and Hospital
and Richard was a voluntee . And now they're married and have an 11-8 year
old son named Glenn.

Let's start the story back before Glenn knew Sue and Richard. Let's
start with a boy named Bobby who was (and is) a resident of Western State.
For five years, Sue and Bobby were friends and he spent weekends, holidays
and summer vacations with her. During those visits, he seemed lonely and
Sue wondered if she couldn't share those happy times with another resident.
Bobby and Glenn were friends and last summer both boys joined Sue and Rich-
ard for their vacations.

When Sue and Richard decided they wanted a foster child to join them
as a family, it was a difficult decision to make: Bobby or Glenn. But it
appeared that Glenn would benefit most from a foster home setting and had
more potential to develop. So, in December, Glenn moved in with Sue and be-
gan a new life in his first "real" home. He had been placed at a facility
for infants and children, then transferred to Western State, and had lived
in an institution all his life.

Sue and Richard are technically a "host" family since permission for
Glenn to live with them was granted by Western State and a court ruling was
not necessary. Glenn's parents are alive, but have maintained only minimal
contact with him over the years. Limited involvement exists between western
State and Glenn. Sue and Richard receive a small Social Security Income
check each month toward his room and board and clothing.

Glenn attends Pathfinder School and can continue to do so until he is
21. Then "who knows?", says Sue, "maybe a group home would be best for
Glenn. We'll have to wait and see." But for right now, with Pathfinder
for a school, and Sue and Richard for a family .. Glenn has learned (since
December) to count to ten and is beginning to understand the numbers; some
letters of the alphabet; to take a bath; to partially dress himself; to go
up and down stairs; and almost write his name. His vocabulary now contains
several hundred words and his speech is much clearer. His social behavior
is more appropriate and he's more outgoing and friendly.

Glenn is a Down's Syndrome child, and Sue and Richard wondered what
the reaction would be from their families and friends when he came to live
with them. They need not have worried, because he has been welcomed as a
member of both families. "Kids come to play", Sue says, "and there haven't
been any neighborhood problems."

He's a real member of the community, too, attending Sunday School (with
normal children) and church. And he attends the CEAAP (University of Pitts-
burgh) Leisure Learn Program at Trees Hall. And this summer he'll participate
in Crafton Day Camp's activities. And he'll go to camp. This will be his
fifth year at camp and Glenn thinks "it's the greatest" because he can swim
every day. And Sue and Richard think Glenn's "the greatest" because he's
their boy.

Incidentally, literally hundreds of our members know the Sue of this
story: Sue Mussman, ACC's Camping and Recreation Coordinator. And you all
know that this isn't really a love story about Sue and Richard. It's a love
story about Glenn.

The Philadelphia Association for Retarded Citizens-has designed a
regular series of three-hour historical tours for developmentally
disabled and handicapped citizens. The tours, in special audio-
equipped, air-conditioned vans, began April 1 and will continue
throughout 1976.

For additional information, contact the Philadelphia Assn. for Re-
tarded Citizens, 1211 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19107.

Tony Orlando has been named Honorary Chairperson for the National
Association for Retarded Citizens.

"My sister Rhonda was born profoundly retarded," Orlando explained.
"I've always wanted to be able to help her and the rest of the six
million mentally retarded people in this country and do it in a
big way. My sister died in August and since then my interest has
become even more important and imperative to me. Now by serving as
National Chairperson for NARC, I can work with 300,000 people who
have a similar interest."

Did you know that in Pennsylvania mentally retarded adults are em-
ployed in more than 100 different vocations? ACC-PARC’s Job Place-
ment Counselor is responsible for the development of all job tryout
sites and job placement activities for Parc-way Industries. He
would welcome the opportunity to discuss possible employment op-
portunities for people who are mentally retarded; and cites a re-
cent study which proved that hiring mentally retarded workers in
jobs for which they are qualified is sound business practice.

For further information, call Bob George, 322-6008.

to attend a meeting of the ACC-PARC Board of Directors. Meetings
are held monthly at the Chapter offices on the North Side. Call
the office, 322-6008, for the date of the next meeting.

"Small children, especially when they are at the age at which they
crawl and begin to walk, are fast and fearless explorers. As they
busily investigate new territories, they put anything they can intc
their mouths -- no matter what it looks or tastes like."

And so, Procter & Gamble has listed the following household items
that should be kept out of the reach of children. They suggest
that these items are stored in a locked cabinet or on.a high shelf:
away from children's reach:

acids - after shave lotions — alcoholic beverages - all medication
- ammonia - analgesics - antifreeze - antiseptics - aspirin - as-
tringents - benzene - bleaches - boric acid - camphor - car polish
- cleaning agents - cologne - cough syrup - cuticle remover - dep-
ilatories - disinfectants - drain cleaners - drugs - dyes - floor
and rug cleaners - furniture waxes and polishes - gasoline - glue
- hormones - insecticides - iodine-kerosene - laxatives - lighter
fluid - liniment - lye - matches — mothballs - nail polish and re-
mover - oil - oven cleaners - paint - paint thinner - paraffin -
perfume - pesticides - petroleum - rat poison - rubbing alcohol -
rust removers - shaving cream and lotion - toilet bowl cleaner -
turpentine - varnishes - vitamins - washing soda - wax - weed
killers.

Audiological services

How is the charge determined?

The sliding scale is based on your ability to pay as deter-
mined by the MH/MR unit.

A formula is used to determine your charge. It includes
consideration for: (a) total salary, (b) number of dependents,
(c) federal tax paid, (d) work expenses, (e) educational ex-
penses, and (f) medical expenses.

The liability clerk at the MH/MR unit will determine your
cost. You have a right to know how or why the determination
is made.

Changes in any of the factors listed above should be shared
with the liability clerk. The liability will be adjusted
accordingly. ”

Do maximum payments reduce over a period of time?

Yes. For non-residential services, the maximum amount you
can be charged is reduced.

At the end of three months, your new maximum liability is
determined by dividing your previous payment by the number
of dependents.

At the end of the first year of service, the maximum liability
is reduced by 10% and continues to lessen by 10% each year.

Thus, consideration is granted for people who will use services
over a long period of time. The longer you use services, the
less you are required to pay.

Are medications included as a service if you pay maximum
liability? ’

Yes. If you are paying maximum liability, you are eligible
for medication on the MH/MR lists at no additional charge.

units since the maximum cost is reduced each year.

If our son dau hter is 18 ears of age or older, how is
t e c arge or serv ces eterm ne ?

Once a person who is mentally retarded reaches age 18,
the liability charge is based on his/her personal income.

Until age 18, the liability charge is based on the parents‘
income.

This relief of financial obligation of parents resulted from
the passage of Senate Bill #53, which was sponsored and sup-
ported by parents across the state.

If services are not available from the MH/MR unit, can the

MH7ﬁ§ unit contract with a private agency?

when it becomes necessary to provide services that are not
available within that MH/MR unit, the unit can, if fiscally
feasible, contract for those services. In some cases, these
services (speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical
theraPYp etc.) may not have higher priority than other needed
services.

Who should you go to if you think you are being overcharged?

Most questions about charges can be handled through the local
MH/MR unit. However, you should be aware that a mechanism
exists to appeal the liability. Contact PARC or the Alle-
gheny County MH/MR office.

SUMMARY:

some families will benefit by obtaining services from MH/MR
A sliding scale,

according to ability to pay, is used to determine charge; and many
services, including medication, can be obtained under the one fee.

MH/MR unit for more details on services your family needs:
