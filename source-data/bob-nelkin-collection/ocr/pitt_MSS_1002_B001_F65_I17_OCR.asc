Dear Sir:

As architects and engineers and as concerned citizens. we are

requesting that yew use the influence of your office to oernit
the use of conventional or Type 6 construction for Residential
care Facilities for retarded adults.

lie think that a well built residence. duplex. or triples would
be the proper type of building for these people. Ile wish to
stay away fro: the institutional t of building and we went
the residential character. By wel built residence I0 naen
eesonry or even siding exterior. wood studs and joists. with
plaster finish. weed stairs with olastercsoffits. and cen-
ventienal windows and doors.

By definition. this is a residence hr a rather special group

of people. They are special only in that they are different
free the neierity. They are entitled to hone like surroundings
and it is oer feeling that they can get this best in an
existing residence.

very truly yours.

Leeis I. Ieid
