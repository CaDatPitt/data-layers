Dear Harry:

Thank you for your letter of November 19. I want to assure
you that Igam concerned about the Western state School volunteer
service programs and the poor judgement that resulted in the partial
distribution of spoiled candy at western. In fact, I keep a large
box of that candy in my office to remind me what can happen when we
are not vigilant. . .

as to your suqgestion,.". . . that the present volunteer coordin~
ator be relieved of all responsibilities . . .", I have instructed
the superintendent to conduct a full investigation and take whatever
action appears to be appropriate, but at a minimum, resulting in an
official letter of reprimand.

"F713 word of caution, and as we discussed, given the present system
I an very doubtful that anything beyond the letter of reprimand will
get through the system and stick. You might note that at no time did
I suggest onlg a letter of reprimand. I will support the superintendent
in whatever action he intends to take.

Best personal wishes,

C.A. Peters ‘
Commissioner of Mental Retarda tion
