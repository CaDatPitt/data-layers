Subject: Dr. James H. Mcclelland, Jr.,
Superintendent, Polk State School and Hospital

Dear Mrs. Wbhlgemuth:

I was shocked to learn of your irresponsible dismissal of Dr. James H. Mcclelland
as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital on April 17, 1973.

I am writing this simple letter in an attempt to express my humble feelings

for the gratitude, honor, and respect that I hold for this great man. He has
my vote of confidence in everything that he does for the operation of the School.

My daughter has been a patent at Polk State School and Hospital for the past
twelve years and I have had many conversations with Dr. Mcclelland during this
time. ‘We parents of retarded children know the measures that are necessary

to control the lives of God's "special" children.

Ebw'many retarded children have you raised, Mrs. Wohlgenuth? Perhaps you should

"Walk a mile in our.moccasins” before you pass judgment on something you do not
kI1OWe ‘

Because of Dr. McC1elland’s lifetime dedicated leadership in this field, I
know that Polk State School and Hospital is the finest in the State of Porn-
sylvania and, indeed, one of the best in the Nhtion.

Please try to understand the real problems of operating this institution from
those who must participate-~the patint, the staff, and the parents--for life,
willingly or not, under constant political and financial stress.

It may be difficult for you to realize that even the patients hold a high
respect and honor in their own way for Dr. mcclelland and this I have seen for
myself. Even a “vegetable” responds to loving, tender care and this is what
is dispensed under Dr. MoClelland's leadership.

I beg you to reconsider the situation for the injustice that will he done
by removing this dedicated man from a position where he is so badly needed.
I have already contacted the local chapter of the PARC, talked with several
parents of retarded children residing at Polk State School and Hospital,
and will continue in my efforts to see that Dr. McClelland is reinstated.
A copy of this letter is being sent to our local newspaper and to Governor

May God bless you and keep you until you are better informed.

Very truly yours,

-:3/.b<}£/an Q ~ I
