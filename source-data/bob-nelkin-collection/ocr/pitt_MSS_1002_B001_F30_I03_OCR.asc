COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE
HARRISBURG

FRANK S. BEAL
SECRETARY

Each year the Governor of Pennsylvania designates November as Mental Retarda-
tion Month. This year, Governor Milton J. Shapp urged all citizens of the Common-
wealth “to give full support to public and private efforts to provide all retarded indi-
viduals with the best possible opportunity to live and work in their communities. "

In Pennsylvania, that statement is not a formality. It is the goal toward which the
Department of Public Welfare’s programs and services for mentally retarded people
are striving.

Some 365,000 Pennsylvanians are mentally retarded, approximately 3 per cent of
the population. The condition causes more disability among children than any other
physical or mental abnormality.

Until relatively recent times, mentally retarded children and adults were often hid-
den from view—-sometimes in institutions far removed from their home communities;
sometimes in their own homes by parents who were reluctant to admit to having a
mentally retarded child.

Mental Retardation is found in every community, in every racial and ethnic group,
among the rich and poor, the educated and the uneducated. Wherever it is found,
there is a need for services to help the mentally retarded individual learn the skills
that will enable him or her to live with dignity and self-respect.

Today, many of the stereotypes about mentally retarded individuals have been
eliminated. We know that the vast majority of mentally retarded people are able to
live in the community, to work, to learn, and to participate in social activities.

This issue of Challenge discusses many of the programs and services that are help-
ing mentally retarded persons and their families. In large measure, the success of
these programs depends upon an enlightened community whose citizens are con-
cerned and responsive to the needs of their mentally retarded neighbors.

DIRECTIONS- ‘
A DIALOGUE WITH
PETER POLLON I

(CHALLENGE interviewed Peter
P. Polloni, Deputy Secretary of
Mental Retardation for the Depart-
ment of Public Welfare. Assuming
his duties on March 21, Mr. Polloni
brings to his position an extensive
background and experience in the
field of mental retardation. Mr.
Polloni has served as director of the
Bucks County Association for Re-
tarded Citizens, the Montgomery
County Association for Retarded
Citizens and the Pennsylvania Asso-
ciation for Retarded Citizens. Mr.
Polloni has served as a special
advisor to the President's Commit-
tee on Mental Retardation and on
the Governor’s Task Force on the
Right to Education.)

CHALLENGE: What do you see as
the most important goal for the
Office of Mental Retardation?

POLLONI: I see the prime objective
for our office at this time as the
achievement of a uniform and con-
tinuous delivery system to serve the
needs of each mentally retarded
individual with the least restrictive
and most appropriate program for
that person. Thus, within a well-
organized system, each person can
move through programs and services

according to his/ her individual
needs.
CHALLENGE: What steps are

needed to help realize a uniform sys-
tem for mental retardation services
in Pennsylvania?

POLLONI: As stepping stones to a
complete service delivery system, the
Office of Mental Retardation is
seeking the passage of three major
legislative programs which will
make available the most compre-
hensive services.

The first is the creation of an
Advisory Board for Mental Retarda-
tion. This board which will have
inherent within itself a strong
expertise in the MR field, will be an
active working board. They will deal
directly with the main issues arising
in MR. I see the Board working in
an integral way with the staff of this
office. We are seeking out members
