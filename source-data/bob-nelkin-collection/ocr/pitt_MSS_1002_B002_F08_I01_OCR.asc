INTRODUCTION

This report to the Federal District Court focuses on the 140 individuals
who have moved from Pennhurst to community living arrangements (CLA's) between
the March l7, 1978 Court Order and November 30,1980. This is the second in a

I I I I I I I 1
series of reports which concentrates on individuals in the community.

This report contains information which was gathered in late 1980 by the
Special Master's staff, through extensive monitoring of the services provided to
the individuals who have moved to CLA's. Additional information was obtained from
the counties or through review of updated records or files. Wherever possible,
services have been described for all 140 individuals, including "out of region"

individuals. Otherwise, information has been given for the 129 people who live in

CLA's of the five county Southeastern Region.

The first three injunctions of the Court's Order of March 17, l978 provided

the framework for this report. These requirements are sumarized as follows:

Paragraph one requires the Comonwealth and Counties to provide suitable

community living arrangements together with other necessary community services.

Paragraph two requires the Commonwealth and Counties to develop and provide a

written Individual Habilitation Plan in accordance with professional standards.

Paragraph three requires the Commonwealth and Counties to monitor the community
services to assure the necessary quantity and quality of services are provided and

maintained.

lThe first report, "Report to the Court: The Individuals Who Moved From Pennhurst
(March 17, 1978--August 31, l980)" was filed with the Court on October 1, 1980.

OVERVIEW

The provision of community services to Pennhurst residents continued at a slow
pace during recent months. During the 1980-81 fiscal year, the Comonwealth and

county defendants have provided community services to an average of four additional

Pennhurst residents per month.

214 people who were residents of Pennhurst on March 17, 1978 are no longer

there. Of that number, fifty—five have died. As ofﬁbvember 30,1980, 140 resided

in community living arrangements. Ninety per cent of the individuals who have moved

to CLA's during this fiscal year were classified as either severely or profoundly

mentally retarded.~

The 140 individuals lived in areas with significantly fewer residents and signi-
ficantly more staff per resident than were in their former living areas at Pennhurst.
The Special Master's staff generally observed that the monitored CLA's were safe,
clean, home-like, appropriately furnished, and oriented to preserve the dignity of

individuals.

The observed CLA's were the antithesis of the overcrowded, understaffed, or
custodial care residences that have generally characterized institutional care, and
of the unsupervised, unsafe, and unhealthy residences that have characterized

boarding homes in the recent past.

Primary health care, such as annual health examinations, has been provided to
the l29 individuals in the counties of the Southeastern Region. Many specialized
health needs were also being successfully addressed. All but one of the residents
had medical assistance or another means to cover medical expenses. The uninsured

individual was in the process of obtaining coverage.

All of the 129 individuals regularly attended school, vocational training, or
skill training programs away from their residences (except for one person whose program
is temporarily in his residence).

Additional community services, such as recreation

programs, were available and were utilized by almost all of the people.

_ 2 -

 

An indepth study of the community services of six randomly selected severely

or profoundly retarded individuals revealed that they were benefiting fronlan array

of community services. The benefit was apparent in both the quality of their lives

and their skill development. Improvements in their adaptive functioning were shown.
Each of the six had increased his/her self care, daily living, and communication skills.
Of these six individuals, the four who can communicate verbally expressed a preference

for living in the community rather than at Pennhurst.

For 138 of the 140 individuals, the program of services was described in the

individual's habilitation plan and was basedﬁon the individual's needs, as sumarized

pg}? §§9“Plan¢”“§g§l§.mmethods, activities had been planned and were being implemented

for almost all of those who moved to the comunity. In two out of every three cases,
there were current Individual Habilitation Plans (IHP's) that conformed to the pub-

. . . l
lished guidelines and had been approved by the Special Master.

This represents a significant effort by the counties to meet the Special Master's

stated goal of a current plan for each former Pennhurst resident.

Currently, no individual is moved from Pennhurst without an IHP. This is a sub-
stantial change resulting from the Court's requirements of employment of case managers
and adherence to extensive guidelines. Prior to the Court Orders, almost all the

people who moved from Pennhurst lacked an Individual Habilitation Plan.

In late 1930, the Special Master's Staff conducted the first indepth monitoring.‘
of the community services for nearly all of the former Pennhurst residents in South-
eastern Region CLA's. The individualized monitoring was conducted toassess whether the
necessary quantity and quality of services were provided and maintained to fulfill the
IHP goals and to meet the individual's needs. Written recommendations were made

following each visit.

l"Guidelines for Case Managers: Implementation of the Individual Habilitation
Plan Process," prepared by Carla S. Morgan, Special Master, revised August, 1980.

33;" '

During the same time, the Commonwealth piloted their first comprehensive and

‘individualized monitoring of the services provided to former Pennhurst residents.

The Comonwealth‘s "audit" format was used to evaluate the services provided to twenty-
two individuals. Comonwealth officials have stated their intentions to audit the

comunity services provided to other former Pennhurst residents in future months.

An assessment of the relative benefit of community services has been undertaken
as part of the longitudinal study of the Pennhurst case, by Temple University
Developmental Disabilities Center (See Appendix). The examiners administered the
Behavior Devlopment Survey (BDS) to matchedigroups on whom baseline BDS's had been
completed in 1978. The study matched thirty¥one persons who had moved to the
comunity from Pennhurst (the "movers") with thirty—one persons who stayed at Pennhurst
(the "stayers") according to sex, level of retardation, IQ, number of years at
Pennhurst, years of birth, and test results on the 1978 BDS. The Temple Study
found that "the thirty-one clients who have moved to community settings have gained
far more, in the sense of expressing behavioral skills, crucial_for independent funct-

ioning, than their ‘twins’ who remain at Pennhurst."

Overall, essential services were being provided, key standards for delivery of
community services were being met, and the individuals who left Pennhurst since

March 17, 1978 seemed to be benefiting from life in the community.

PARAGRAPH ONE

PROVISION OF COMMUNITY SERVICES

S

Commonwealth and county defendants, their successors,

and their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys
and all persons in active concert or participation with
them are permanently enjoined to provide suitable community
living arrangements for the retarded residents of Pennhurst,
and those retarded persons on its waiting list, together
with such comunity services as are necessary to provide
them with minimally adequate habilitation until such time

as the retarded individual is no longer in need of such

living arrangement and/or community service.

THE POPULATION

There are now 140 individuals who have moved from Pennhurst to the community
between March 1978 Court Order and November 30,1980 (Table 1). Most of the persons
who moved from Pennhurst moved to CLA's. No one moved to a boarding home. No one

has been readmitted to Pennhurst or any other state institution for retarded citizens.

In the thirty-three months since the Court's Order, the Pennhurst individuals
have moved to CLA's at an average rate of four persons per month (Table 2). 953
individuals, including nine who are not retarded, still remain at Pennhurst. During
the September 1, 1980 to November 30,1980 period only Delaware, Montgomery and

Philadelphia Counties have moved individuals (Table 3).b

Prior to each move, the counties prepared an Individual Habilitation Plan which
was reviewed and approved by the Special Master. Since July, 1980, the approved IHP's
have then been reviewed at a hearing by the_Hearing Master to determine whether the
planned community services would be more beneficial than the services at Pennhurst_

(pursuant to the Court of Appeals Opinion of December 13, 1979 and that the move

’ was voluntary (pursuant to the Supreme Court Order of June 30, 1980).

Two-thirds of the people who have moved to CLA's are men and one—third are
women, closely paralleling the distribution by sex of those who still remain at
Pennhurst. Those who moved to the community had spentgan average of twenty—one

years in the institution.

Of the 140 individuals who have moved to CLA's seventy percent are classified
as either severely or profoundly retarded (Table 4), as are eighty—five percent of
those who remain at Pennhurst. Ninety percent of the individuals who have moved to
CLA's during this present fiscal year are classified as either severely or profoundly

retarded (most are profoundly retarded).

THE COMMUNITY LIVING ARRANGEMENTS
A All of the Pennhurst residents who moved to the community, with the exception”
of the nine persons who lived with their relatives, resided in units funded and approved

by the Community Living Arrangements Program governed by the Comonwealth of Pennsyl-

_ vania and the county governments. Twenty-six private agencies, under contract with the

governmental units, actually operated the CLA's.

These CLA’s were either apartments or family-sized houses, where one to eight
residents lived. The typical population in the CLA residents‘ previous Pennhurst
area was eleven to twenty people. Nine percent lived in Pennhurst areas with forty-one

to fifty residents.

Each of the l4O individuals lived in a CLA with fewer residents than in their

former Pennhurst living area (Table 5). The average CLA had one—eighth the number

nqfﬂgesidentsmthanwthe former Pennhurst living area. The CLA's_averaged 2.5 residents;

the Pennhurst areas averaged 21.2 residents.

With the exception of several individuals who were purposely placed into semi-
independent living within the CLA program, all others have one form or another of

twenty-four hour staff supervision.

139 of thel 140 CLA residents lived in CLA's with more staff members per
resident_than in their former Pennhurst living areal (Table 6). At Pennhurst, the

average was one staff member for eight residents. At the CLA's, the average*was

one staff member for two residents. In other words, the CLAs averaged four times

more staff members per resident than the individuals's former Pennhurst living areas.

—u—-:1:

lThis comparison was drawn for the 3-11 p.m. shift in the institution and
approximately the same time period in the CLAs. The Special Master's staff
conducted a phone survey of CLA Project Directors on December 19, 1980 as the
basis of the CLA information. "The Pennhurst Center July 18, 1980 Staffing
Study" is the source of the information on the individuals’ former Pennhurst
living area.

staff ratio in the C§afs_was one staff £6 sir residents.. The range in the former
Pennhurst living areas was one staff to four residents (highest) to one staff for

ten residents (lowest).

At the time of the monitoring visits, the residents were observed to be fully
and appropriately dressed. The monitors did not observe any suspicious bruises,

cuts or SC8.I'S .

The apartments and houses were observed to be generally ¢lean and free of offensiﬁé
smells. Most rooms and furnishings were home-like in appearance and decoration. The
residents had dressers and other places to store their clothing and personal possessions.
Almost all of the residents had personal possessions. Usually residents had a private
bedroom or a bedroom shared with only one other person. The bathrooms in the CLA's

afforded privacy for the individuals and were equipped with toilet paper, soap, etc.

Ninety ﬁercent Of the CLAls had written emergency procedures that included infor-'
mation on doctors, ambulances, police, fire, poison centers, etc. A similar percentage

of»CLAs hadﬁihe required general fire and safety procedures.

‘O

HEALTH CARE_

General health is the first area of concern in the IHP, and is a similar priority

‘in the monitoring process.

Primary health care has been provided to the former Pennhurst residents who live
in CLA's. Between September, 1979, and November 1980, annual medical examinations
were performed by physicians for all but one of the former Pennhurst residents
living in CLA's. That individual had refused any medical or dental treatment. All
of the women involved were seen by a gynecologist for examinations (Table 7). Dentists

examined eighty-nine percent of the CLA residents.

Case managers and residential staff have made arrangements for continuing health
care. Physicians have been identified to provide ongoing medical treatment for
ninety percent of the individuals. Similarly, dentists have been identified for

most of the people. Gynecologists have been identified for most of the women. While

specific doctors and dentists have been utilized for care in their fields, clinics have

been heavily relied upon for gynecological care.

Monitors from the Office of the Special Master confirmed that plans to meet both
primary and specialized health needs were usually being addressed. For many individuals,
case managers or residential staff had identified the need for additional health
evaluations, examinations, or treatments.‘ Nearly half of these appointments or re-
ferrals had already been scheduled. For others,_referrals or appointments had not.
been made. No instances had been identified where an individual with a serious condi-

tion was not being treated in the community due to an inability to obtain health care.

For some individuals, community—based health care has resulted in improvements

of health or daily functioning.. Pages 21-25 describe a wide range of treatment modalities

(médical,surgical, pharmaceutical, and physical therapy) and their application to

relevant conditions (medical, dental, vision, mobility and medication—related problems).

OTHER COMMUNITY SERVICES AND BENEFITS

Day Program
ép
Without exception, regardless of the severity of skill deficits, each of the

140 CLA residents regularly attended a day program, eg. a public school, vocational
training, or skill training program (Table 9). Twenty—seven individuals are of school
age and were enrolled in either a public school program or other day programs. The 113
adults have been enrolled in either workshops or other day programs.

139 of the 140 former Pennhurst residents attended day programs away from their

residence. One individual received his day program at his residence.

Transportation to Day Program
Most of the people were transported to their day program by the day program
provider (Table 10). Ten people utilized public transportation to the day program;

each of them was described by staff who work with them as "aware of danger".

Recreation
All but two of the 140 persons living in CLA's participated in recreation
programs (Table 11). Most participated in comunity—sponsored programs. Only ten

people participated exclusively in CLArsponsored recreation activities.

Other Services

The availability and use of health care, day programs and recreation actitivites
were assessed during the monitoring process. The monitors also inquired about other
needed services. Forty percent of the persons needed such services or therapies
as speech and physical therapy and training in mobility or safety. In half of the

cases, providers had been identified and referrals had already been made.

Income
Ninety—one percent of the former Pennhurst residents in Southeastern Region

CLA's had a public source of income such as Supplemental Security Income, Social

_ 11 -

Security, or Veteran's Administration benefits. Most people received Supple-
mental Security Income (SSI). Three people had no income. For those receiving
public benefits the representative payees were staff members in forty—one per-
cent of the cases and relatives in thirty percent of the cases. Twenty—five
percent of the individuals were their own payees. The payee was unknown in

four percent of the cases.

two-part questioning strategy was pursued:

THE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE OF SIX INDIVIDUALS
These detailed analyses of the comunity experience of three individuals
classified as severely retarded and three individuals classified as profoundly
retarded were undertaken to assess the impact of comunity services upon the lives

and development of the former Pennhurst residents-

A random selection procedure was used to identify these individuals from

the group of severely impaired and the group of profoundly impaired individuals who
represent 46.6 percent and 23.6 percent respectively, of the 140 people who have
moved to CLA's from Pennhurst since March, 1978. Information for these analyses
was drawn from available sources: interviews, visits and observations of the‘indi—
viduals, interviews with day program, CLA and case management staff, Individual
Habilitation Plans (IHP's), other reports, documents and correspondence including

Pennhurst records, and the monitoring performed by the Office of the Special Master.

For each individual and in relation to all areas of functioning the same basic
1.) What is the individual doing now? and
2.) Does this represent a change from their previous level of skills or their prior
status? Respondents to these questions in all instances were instructed to comment
only in terms of their direct knowledge of the individual and to focus on the time
period since they had come into contact with the individual. Respondents were re-

quired to provide specific behavioral examples to document any opinions or judgements

expressed.

These analyses, focusing on people's day to day lives, were undertaken to
illustrate,in terms of actual individuals,the implications and meanings of the

community service information which is expressed throughout the rest of this report.

7. .14. . rv-vwm »-nu--:

COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE: MR. T.

Mr. T., a twenty—three year old man, has been living in the community for two
years. He is classified as profoundly retarded. He interacts with his environment
only on a very limited basis. He is non-verbal and when unoccupied engages in a
wide repertoire of self-stimulating behaviors. Staff who work with Mr. T. reported
that he exhibits fewer of these behaviors now than when he entered the community
and less of the extreme posturing that usually accompanied this behavior. Mr. T.
was described as "calmer, healthier" and "doing tremendously better" by his day
program providers.

_ Mr. T. lives in a community living arrangementl, attends a day program,

and receives supportive services. He is now, reported staff, more able to tolerate
programing and training. Due to the severity of his handicap, Mr. T. makes his
progress toward his individual program goals in small but nevertheless apparent
‘steps.

In dressing, behavioral data documented that Mr. T. can now complete the last
step of zipping his pants, as well as perform the last step in putting on his socks,
with greater independence. Mr. T. is now independently throwing away the paper towel

"after handwashing and is starting to turn on the water himself — something he had

previously resisted. CLA staff reported that he is now learning to bring the ‘
toothbrush to his mouth. He is also involved in a program to build his tolerance for
wearing eye glasses. The individualized training Mr. T. is receiving appears to be
excellent; it is highly structured, addresses his complex needs through multiple
avenues, and it is delivered in a caring manner. The overall quality of his day
program would be enhanced if the program had more adequate space in which to organize
a more distraction—free environment. T

Range of motion exercises as recommended in a physical therapy evaluation are
provided to Mr. T. in his day program. Programming recommended by an occupational
therapy evaluation is also provided. ‘

Assisting Mr. T. to decrease his abnormal posturing and to ease his contorted
sleeping position have eliminated the circulatory problems for which Mr. T. had
formerly required medication and services from vascular specialists. Mr. T's
dandruff condition has improved and the CLA staff continue to treat it with special-
ized shampoo. He has also had a thorough dental exam which required hospitalization
for anesthesia. His reported episodes of gum bleeding have stopped; Mr. T's dentist
felt that this wasin.response to being exposed to correct toothbrushing techniques
for the first time. Although Mr. T. still does not chew, the CLA staff have found
that he no longer requires pureed food and that he has not had any choking episodes.

Mr. T. has made progress in establishing eye contact with objects, an important
step for further skill training. His eye contact with other people has not yet
developed much; the CLA and day program are working to help Mr. T. tolerate and
enjoy eye contact more. In attending to tasks, Mr. T. is showing some progress and
more independence, but this is still somewhat erratic.

¢—- §¢_.

he CLA in which Mr. T. was originally placed in was closed when the county,
dissatisfied with performance of the provider, terminated the provider's
contract. Mr. T. was placed in respite care and then in his present place-
ment. His case manager was responsible for the coordination of his transi-
tion and placement. E

_ 14 -

*@%§%, ﬁ%W@wT

Mr. T's communicative skills have begun to expand. He shows a slight increase

in sound localization and he can now respond to simple comands, no longer always
requiring physical prompts, but rather less directive gestures. In beginning
to learn to anticipate sequences of events, Mr. T. has begun to display some basic

problem solving strategies.

Mr. T's throwing of objects and pushing people have decreased as has his bi-
zarre behavior and posturing. A behavioral overcorrection procedure program is
being developed for Mr. T. (which will subsequently be presented to the day program's
Human Rights Committee) to reduce the self—stimulatory behaviors which interfere with

his participation in other aspects of his program.

Coordination between Mr. T's day program and his CLA is achieved through daily
written entires into a program "book" that travels with him to his day program and

when he returns home.

Mr. T. has participated in recreational trips including shopping, picnics, and
numerous visits to Dairy Queen. Mr. T. occasionally swims at the YMCA. .

COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE: MS. S.

For the first time in her life, Ms. S., a forty-two year old woman, is able
to get in and out of bed by herself. She is able to do this utilizing a piece of
adaptive equipment designed and built for her in the community living arrangement,
where she has lived for a year and a half. She shares her apartment with a woman
from Pennhurst with whom she chose to live, and a resident advisor who focuses on
assisting Ms. S. in a manner that fosters her independence.

Ms. S's adaptive functioning is more severely impaired than her cognitive

functioning, due to cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Ms. S. spent twenty—eight years

at Pennhurst. ‘Since moving to the community, Ms. S. has shown on overall gain in
her adaptive functioning, as documented by the objective testing carried out as part
of the Pennhurst"L0ngitudinal Stud?’ - Ms. S's grooming skills have improved. Her
resident advisor reported that she can now comb and brush her hair as well as apply
deodorant and cologne. She now sets the table, uses small kitchen appliances, iden-
tifies cooking ingredients and prepares her lunch to take to the workshop.

Dentures obtained in the comunity to replace missing and irrevocably decayed
teeth have assisted Ms. S. in improving her articulation, making her speech more
easily understood by those around her. Staff who work with Ms. S. attributed the
improvement in her speech to both her new dentures and the individual speech therapy
she has been receiving in conjunction with her day program. She has become more
communicative and will now indicate when she has to go to the bathroom. Ms. S.
achieved one of her program goals documented in her individual plan, becoming more
social and increasing her interaction with co-workers.

Under the supervision of a physical therapist, Ms. 8. receives exercises from
the CLA staff for the spasticity in her arms and legs. Her independence is enhanced
by the adaptive equipment installed in her bedroom and the bathrooms in her apartment
and workshop. She continues to push her own wheelchair. ‘ "

Ms. S's workshop reported that she has learned many vocationally-related skills
relevant to functioning in a workshop, including counting, size and color discrimina-
tion, and packaging objects. She is also involved in a money skills group. Her
present vocational goal is to increase the amount of work she produces. This goal
and Ms. S's overall vocational functioning would be enchanced by a more constant
supply of contract work for the workshop. Additionally, with more extensive skill
training, and training in a wider range of skills, Ms. S. could be assisted to be
even more vocationally productive and independent.

Ms. S's mother has been in contact with her daughter's day program and CLA.
The staff reported that she is pleased with her daughter's comunity program and visits
her at her apartment.

Ms. S's community placement was selected, in part, to respond to her desire to
live with a friend from Pennhurst. Ms. S. enjoys country music and goes out to
restaurants, movies and dances. When questioned in regard to her preferences, Ms. S.
expressed her preference for where she lives now, as compared to Pennhurst, and would
like to stay. Among the things she likes better is that "she is able to go out more."

- 15 _

COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE: MR. R.

"Open to experience" and "willing to try anything" is how Mr. R. is now
described by his case manager and his resident advisor. During the forty—five
years he spent at Pennhurst, he was described as "difficult to motivate" and "reluc-
tant to experience new things". Mr. R., age fifty—five, has now lived in the
comunity for a year and a half; his community living arrangement is an apartment
where he lives with another older man and a resident advisor. Mr. R's functioning
level is classified as severely to profoundly retarded.

The staff who work with Mr. R. reported that he has made a good adjustment after
he experienced an acute schizophrenic episode last year, which was determined to be
related to a drastic medication cut. Herequired.two weeks of inpatient psychiatric
hospitalization, after which he was able to return to his apartment. Staff reported
that his behavior has improved tremendously since his hospitalization; now they find
him to be more social, more cooperative and willing to interact more with other
people. At his day program, Mr. R. talks to his roommate, eats with him and spends
time with him. While at Pennhurst, Mr. R. had been reported to be a loner, had
interactedverylittle with others and was detached. Mr. R. now receives a much
smaller dosage of psychotropic medication, which he requests himself nightly.

During the first two months he was at the CLA, staff reported that his speech
increased. When he first moved to the community they found him to be almost non~
verbal, without any labels for comon objects, such as a table or refrigerator.
While at Pennhurst Mr. R. had developed his own system of sign language, although
he had never received any formal instruction in signing. A speech evaluation per-
formed in the community recommended that the CLA staff carry out an informal speech
stimulation program encouraging Mr. R. to verbalize. Visitors to his CLA, including
the case manager and program monitors, reported that Mr. R. seemed very social and
interested in communicating with people; he might benefit from being encouraged to
develop a larger signing repertoire to facilitate his comunication.

Mr. R. has learned to prepare breakfast and lunch and can now also cook two
main dishes for dinner CLA staff reported. Mr. R. can now clear the table indepen-
dently but still requires reminders on how to set the table. Both his toileting and
bathing skills have improved. Mr. R's previously reported reluctance to shave has
become irrelevant since he initiated growing a beard; accompanied by staff, he now
visits a barber monthly. CLA staff need to provide Mr. R. with reminders on general
grooming. Although Mr. R. has a history of hoarding behavior, that behavior is
reported to have decreased.

Mr. R's productivity has increased in his day program. He is also receiving
training in time identification and mobility as part of that program. Mr. R. has
begun to identify different functional times of the day, such as lunchtime or
breaktime. He understands what money is used for and CLA staff are assisting him
in increasing his moneydrelated skills.

When questioned, Mr. R. indicated a preference for living in the community so
that he can be closer to his family. Visits from his family have increased since he
moved into the community. Mr. R's visitors have included his sister, his cousin, and
an aunt and uncle. Mr. R's sister has approved his Individual Habilitation Plan.

Mr. R. enjoys movies and restaurants; he has gone on supervised weekend trips.

COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE: MS. Q.

Ms. Q., a twenty-seven year old woman, has lived in an accessible community
living arrangement for two years. She has cerebral palsy and is classified as severe-
ly mentally retarded.

Ms. Q. has become more responsible for herself, seeming more aware of herself
as a person and as an adult, according to reports by her CLA staff and case manager.
She shows more self—control and is more cooperative than when she first moved to the
community. Behaviors such as yelling and cursing have decreased. Ms. Q's case
manager reported that she is handling disappointments about her family, such as can-
celled plans or difficulties in parting, more maturely. CLA staff worked intensively
with Ms. Q. prior to Thanksgiving and reported that she and her family all spoke of
how much better that made the holiday.

In contrast to the "quiet loner" she was described as at Pennhurst, Ms. Q. is
reported now to be speaking more and more understandably. After a speech and
comunication evaluation done in the community, a consultant trained the CLA staff,
who now provide a program to Ms. Q. directly to stimulate her verbal and gestural
comunication. Utilizing an adaptive device attached to the phone Ms. Q., despite
her spasticity, can now dial independently and initiate communication with relatives
and friends.

Since living in the community, Ms. Q. has been evaluated by dentists who sub-
sequently identified the need for extensive restoration work which has now been
completed, preserving as many of her teeth as possible. Hospitalized and under
anesthesia, she had five extractions, twelve to fifteen fillings, a root canal, and a
cap. Ms. Q. had a gynecological examination to evaluate menstrual irregularity, but
no specialized treatment was required. Orthopedic care, physical therapy, and pre-
scription shoes that compensate for a difference in the length of her legs have
helped Ms. Q. to be less dependent on her wheelchair. .Ms. Q. ambulates with crutches
independently. Staff reported that Ms. Q's stamina has increased. She can negotiate
longer distances in restaurants and in her day program and ambulate independently
from her first floor apartment to a car.

A waterpik and an electric toothbrush purchased for Ms. Q. by the CLA function
as adaptive equipment making it possible for Ms. Q. to care for her teeth indepen-
dently. Similarly, the installation of a hand—held shower massage has made it possi-
ble for Ms. Q. to rinse her hair independently. Staff reported that Ms. Q. has achieved
additional program goals, including consistently using soap and shampoo and brushing
her hair regularly. She now carries her purse to work daily and is also reported to
have made significant progress on her goal to dress independently in the morning with
reasonable speed. Ms. Q's table manners are reported to have improved and she has
learned txzuse a napkin and cut with a knife. Ms. Q. now clears her own place after
dinner. With clearer and more consistent expectations from CLA staff, and with
additional structured training in skills related to household tasks, Ms. Q. may be
able to function with an even greater degree of independence.
