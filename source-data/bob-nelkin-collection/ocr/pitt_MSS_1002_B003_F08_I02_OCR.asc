 

Consider this personal correspondence fromime to you as a fellow

parent, and.not as a.member of the grievance comittee at Western
State School and Hospital. .

After reading your letter of December 23, 1973 to Mr. Hiltner
concerning the medical mismanagement of your son Mark at Western,

I concluded that there is little if any likelihood of ongoing .
improvement in the care and treatment of your son at this institution
uder the present circumstances. Regardless of how satisfactory

to you the answers to your questions might be——as posed in your
letter-you.mmst.be willing to take an extra bit of action in

order to prevent recurrences of the tragic situation described

in your letter.

I say this because I was forced to take independent action myself

in order to ensure that my son, Eddie, received a higher level

of medical, nutritional, and psychiatric attention in the past

month. What I did was engage a psychiatrist from the "outside"

as a private consultant on Eddie's care. This consultant is a
psychiatrist in whom and I have full trust, and.with the ’
permission of Mr. Hiltner which I obtained after writing a letter similar
to yours) this psychiatrist has met with the "team" responsible

for Eddie's programs at'Western. As a result I have already

seen an increased degree of attention to my son's specific needs.

I would suggest therefore that you consider the following and
hold it in your back.pocket until such.time as it might be neededr~
say at a staffing or as a result of direct confrontation with those
individuals at Western who have obviously treated your son, Mark,
with less than human dignity. Retain, at your own expense, a
private outside physician to consult on a monthly basis with the
staff at Western who are concerned with the care of your son. “
' Clear this with Mr. Hiltner first-of course after you have.
received an answer to your letter. In this way you will be
apprised of your son's medication and ongoing medical history.

As the parents of this boy, you and have this right.

Wait until the proper mment and th it. Your son's

being institutionalized does not.meke him less of a son to you,’
nor does it take away any rights you have regarding his well being.

I say again hold this in your back pocket until it is decided by
yourself and your wife that indeed this is the only viable alternative
to the level of care he is getting now. I can only say that in the
past month that my own private "consultant" has been involved there
has been a measurable difference in the attention given to my'own
son's well being. As I said this is personal correspondence. I

 K
and sharing it only with Jack McLaj_n and Harry Goldberg.
Needless to say, you have my own support and best wishes

for a speedy resolution of your particular problem.

Sincerely ,
