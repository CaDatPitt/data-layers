 April .21 , 1975

Executive Dwector

The Honorable Alexander F. Barbierri, Judge
Court Administrator of Pennsylvania-

3l73 Penn Center Plaza

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania l9l02

Dear Judge Barbierri;

‘As Chairman of the P.A.R.C. Right.to Education Committee, I am responding
to your letter of April l6, 1975 to Governor Shapp.. In your letter, you express concern
about P.A.R.C's position as it relates to the services and programs at white Haven.

I believe it is helpful to understand that P.A.R.C has several positions
on separate issues. One concern relates to the expansion of state school and hospital
buildings such as Plan 3 at white Haven. This statement supports all the programmatic
components of Phase 3 but proposes that these services be community based and not adjacent
to the facilities for residents. However, I will let others speak to the details of this
position. My purpose here, is to plea that we not identify the position taken with
respect to construction to the position taken with respect to right to education.

g Our right to education position is essentially a legal one, The legal
responsibility for education and training of state school students at white Haven cannot
be included in Phase 3, for they have been designated as the responsibility of the
Department of Education.. The old model of a unified service delivery system,whereby all
professionals providing services are responsible to the superintendent, has been replaced
with a new model, whereby education is provided by those who are not responsible to the
superintendent. Education is now the responsibility of the Department of Education, this is
a leg H position and not one that now needs to be argued. It would be a mistake to either
promote or oppose the present construction of demountable classrooms on white Haven n‘
the basis of Phase 3 or on the basis of Hhite Haven's need for programmatic facilities.
These buildings are not for this purpose,they are being erected with_the express intent
that they be leased to the Intermediate Unit for educational programs. -

. Our objection states that the students at white Haven cannot be given

what the Consent Agreement calls an appropriate program of education with the facil’tie*
being constructed. There are several considerations which support our position. “
lS a eeg

white Haven students will be segregated and educated apart from other retarded s

educated by the Intermediate Unit number l8 and the School District of Crestwood.

but equal facilities are not equal. The second agrument is one of professional educational
judgement, based on experience, this experience states that institutionalized students,
including the vast majority of those severly and profoundly retarded, do in fact benefit
from getting on a bus, moving to another setting..and associating as much as possible with
other students. The third agrument is again legal. The priming process which lead to the
proposed classrooms on the grounds of the state school and hospital was faulty and in
violation of the School Code. Had the Department of Education placed the primary responsi~
bility on the local school district, we believe that the outcome would have been different.
