Dear Ms. Wohlegemuth:

,. ......~. _.

After many years of visits'to"Polk“§chool, I heartily disagree with your
firing of Dr. McC1elland. I am sure there are many potentially dangerous
patients at Polk and some restrictions are needed. For the most part, the
children all seemed very fond of Dr. McClelland.

I suggest you also drop in unexpectedly at the Pittsburgh Transitional
Homes and see some of the conditions there. My cousin, Ann C‘, was a
resident at Polk for many years and moved to Highland Avenue last summer.
She has not improved one bit since then and still cannot read. Her writing
is just the same as when she was at Polk, and for the State to think she can
be trained to make her living is unbelievable. We were greeted by a matron

in dirty short shorts, smoking a cigarette and blowing smoke in my mother's

face. Since then Ann has been moved to Negley Avenue. However, she has the

freedom of walking East Liberty streets and certainly was much safer at Polk.

Do stop at the Transitional Homes at your convenience - and of course,

unannounced! I again repeat - I heartily disagree with the firing of Dr.

McClelland.
