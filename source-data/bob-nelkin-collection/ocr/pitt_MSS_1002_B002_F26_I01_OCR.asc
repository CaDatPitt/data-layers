Report of Visit
Pennhurst Center
Spring City, Pennsylvania
»June 28-29, 1980
I. Introduction
At the request of the Office of the Special Master, Federal District Courﬁgt
Pennhurst Center was visited by James D. Clements, M.D., and John W. Cooledge, M.D.,
on June 28-29, 1980, for purposes of gaining an overview of medical and related
services, with particular emphasis upon the institutions recent mortality
experience. V
The practice of medicine is both an art and a science. In a closed

institutional environment it is imperfect at best due to the kaleidoscopic
influences, both physical and mental, affecting clients’ well—being. Obser-
vations of behavior or lack of behavior, so important in determining peoples’
states of health, are difficult to collect consistently due to the multiple
authority figures who in effect govern the lives of institutionalized retarded
people -- a multiplicity brought on by staff turnover, reassignments, shift
changes, overcrowding, etc. Even when data collection is consistent, its
interpretation may be confounded by this-fragmentation of authority figures,

or by failure to consider physical (often medically—correctable) discomfort

as a cause of severe misbehavior in those unable to verbalize their pain.

It is therefore mandatory that the large, variable, and sometimes discordant
group of individuals, both direct-care and professional, unify and meld their
efforts on behalf of the people whom they control: precise observations
succinctly recorded,carefully individualized assessments of needs, and skilled
treatment techniques must be drawn together into genuine interdisciplinary

practice. This principle surely applies most firmly to institutional medical

practice: because of physicians' unique authority bestowed by law and custom

Report of Visit - Pennhurst Center Page 2

vto order that institutionalized persons be treated in some particular way,

they have the highest possible moral and legal duty to practice according
to this standard. At Pennhurst, we find that for a wide variety of reasons ’ 5

this duty is often_not fulfilled.

II. Observations

Due to the limited time available for this visit, observations were
necessarily selective rather than comprehensive. Prior to our visits we
examined in detail portions of records supplied to us for over forty Pennhurstv
clients who had expired during the period March 1978 through June 1980: this
review included death summaries prepared by physicians,_and where available,
autopsy reports. Some of these were designated for more detailed record
review during our Visit. In addition, in order to gain a perspective on
current patterns of care records of several living clients were also examined
on site, and observations made of these clients' living environment and
general condition. Comments about a number of these clients will be offered
below.

Records of deceased and living clients shared certain characteristics.
We found gaps, sometimes of several months; in decedents' charts these gaps
were often just prior to the terminal event. Progress notes were fragmented
and multidisciplinary, creating hazardous situations: for example, one
"discipline" staff member would note that the resident appeared ill while on
the same day, on the same record, another would state that the resident was
doing well.

In many instances, in the records of deceased residents, it

became obvious that signs of problems were present long enough before the

Report of Visit - Pennhurst Center Page 3

terminal event, that if heeded and acted upon could prevent death or mitigate
the threat of serious accident or disease.
‘item: resident J S , who died in January 1979 after strangling
on a sock, was known to have passed a sock in his stool several
days earlier; late the previous month he was known to have
ingested yet another sock,_and the next day a "non—nutritive
substance". The medical response to these previous episodes
consisted of an order that he wear "muffs" (presumably some kind
of restraint mitten): no evidence could be found that the use
of the muffs was monitored, nor that the behavior in question
had abated; neither was there any evidence of attempts to eliminate
the behavior through appropriate training.

lgem; M N expired in May 1978 from complications of congenital

-heart disease. The record shows that cardiology consultation to

evaluate the possibility of corrective surgery was recommended by

an orthopedic consultant in October 1974; another consultant again

suggested this in July 1975. Examination of the record shows no
evidence that even the possibility of cardiac consultation was ever

seriously entertained for this purpose by Pennhurst staff, let
alone the possibility of corrective heart surgery.

Item: D 7 B , whose death in March l978 was attributed to status

 

epilepticus (autopsy report) was taking four different anticonvul—
sant drugs: despite persistence of seizures averaging about once
per month, no reports of nor orders for anticonvulsant drug blood

levels could be found in his record. '”

Item: M H , whose death in October 1978 was attributed to

seizures, had had a series of severe seizures on May 18, 1978,,
‘at which time he was taking Dilantin and phenobarbital. The
attending physician increased the dose of Dilantin the next day,
but blood levels of phenobarbital and Dilantin performed three
weeks later showed that both drugs were still being given in
sub—therapeutic amounts. Despite this evidence of inadequate
therapy, during the remaining 4 1/2 months of the resident's
life the physician neither changed the dose of these drugs nor
documented any reason for not doing so.

The cases cited above typify the standard of medical care shown in the
records which we reviewed. Problems of this kind could surely be'ameliorated
by better coordination and standardization of medical and medically—related
care at Pennhurst, together with more consistent efforts by all staff members
to identify and respond in a more sensitive and individualized manner to each
resident's needs.

In literally all the records reviewed, of Pennhurst residents both living
and deceased, it can be stated that documentation of the process of medical
diagnosis and treatment'is scandalously poor. Though it is often possible to
trace (and with the use of informed imagination, to justify) the management of
acute ailments (pneumonia, etc.), it is just as often ngt_possible to do so
with chronic ones. Multihandicapped patients regularly receive long lists of
medications of various kinds while having no stated diagnoses, signs, or
symptoms which would explain the drugs‘ use. ln Capitol Hall I, for example

(which we visited because of its rather high incidence of resident deaths),

we commonly found residents receiving from six to twelve or more medications,

Report of Visit — Pennhurst Center Page 5

of which many have serious known adverse_side effects, with literally no
identifiable justification for using them. why, for example, does F

F i receive Thorazine and Valium? Valium, it might be speculated, relieves

her spasticity; but nowhere is there an observation as to whether her spasticity‘.

is in_£ag£ improved by it: instead, one finds Valium reordered, month after
month, in a shopping list of medications written by (presumably) a nurse and
signed, by rote, by a physician. Does Ms. f show or not show tardive
dyskinesia, a known side effect of Thorazine? we cannot tell‘from the record;
all we know is that Ms. F.i receives Thorazine for an unidentified reason.
Why has she for at least the past fifteen months received Tagamet, a drug
indicated for short-term (a few weeks to a few months) treatment of upper
gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding? The record is silent on this. While we
ourselves might in rare cases use Tagamet for longer periods than indicated
_by its present FDA—approved labelling, we would insist on proper documentation
of the reasons for doing so, and the result thereof. Such documentation is
absent from Ms. F 's record.\ And why does she receive Dyazide, a diuretic
capable of further compromising her already borderline hydration status, when
‘there is no documented indication for it in her record?

While in Capitol hall I we reviewed the case of A R , who has
multiple motor handicaps in addition to a seizure problem for which she receives
Dilantin. In recent months Ms. R has been in a poor state of health: she
was admitted to a Pennhurst infirmary unit several weeks ago, and while there
the concentration of Dilantin in her bloodstream was found to be excessively
high. This problem was treated with good results in the infirmary, according
to the record, and she was transferred back to Capitol Hall I: since then,

according to the record and to staff members whom we interviewed, her condition

 

Report of Visit - Pennhurst Center Page 6

has again seemed to deteriorate, with progressive difficulty in maintaining
adequate oral intake of food and fluids. It is our experience that inadequate
food and fluid intake can result in concentration of drugs such as Dilantini
to toxic levels, but no Dilantin blood level test has been done on Ms. R
since the beginning of her latest deterioration. To us this suggests at the
least inattention to a known risk factor. If such is not the case, it is
not documented in her record.

The effects of poor documentation of the medical diagnosis/treatment

"after hours”

paradigm are extensive. Pennhurst currently utilizes an
(night and weekend) medical coverage system which places a premium upon the
ability of part-time physicians to assess and treat acute problems in residents
whose long—term medical conditions, and the rationale for medications being

V

used to treat those conditions, is at best occult and obscure. The same may
be said of Pennhurst's own medical staff when a resident's regularly-assigned
physician is absent for whatever reason (vacation, sick leave, ctc.), {UV
result is clearly a dangerous situation for any Pennhurst resident whose
medical condition is fragile. This problem extends even to the formal annuall
// - -
physical exams which we generally found on most charts: these exams tend to
be extremely sketchy and superficial, and generally conclude only with a single
diagnosis of "mental retardation", even where powerful drugs such as Tagamet
and Dyazide, which have no known use in treating mental retardation pe£_§e,
are being used. One can only conclude from such documentation that drugs are
being prescribed irriationally, or as is more probably the case, that drugs
which have or once may have had some relevance to medical problems are being

prescribed without continuing evaluation of the client's present needs. (The

problem is compounded, incidentally, by use of two different forms for physical

Report of Visit - Pcnnhurst Center Page 7

examinations, varying from client to client: one of these forms is really only
a "review of systems” which is'quite inadequate for such use, not having even

space for such essential information as vital signs (blood pressure, pulse,

respiratory rate, temperature). ‘_

Use of psychotropic medications is particularly problematic. Orders for
these drugs are regularly written without a precise statement or description
of behaviors which they are intended to control, The result is that staff who
provide day-in day-out care have no specific information concerning behavioral
observations needed to assist physicians in assessing the effects of these
drugs: consequently behavioral observations, when recorded at all, are
couched in vague and highly subjective terms. _This problem extends even to
those clients who are regularly seen by a psychiatrist: this consultant's
notes consistently contain recommendations for psychotropic treatment based
on sketchy information whose source is not documented. The record of one
deceased client, L Cv , contains an unfortunate example of the kind
of therapeutic chaos which can result from this situation. Mr. C 's
monthly Team Leader Note for May 1977 complains that the attending physician
refused to prescribe psychotropic medication despite the psychiatrist's

that this refusal constituted a viola-

recommendation to do so, and suggests

tion of Mr. C 's human rights. Four months later the Team Leader reported
that the Unit Director had appealed to the acting Medical Director for
institution of psychotropic drugs. Two months later still, and again three
months after that, the psychiatrist noted that Mr. C was receiving no
psychotropic medications but behaving acceptably. Finally, in utter confusion
over this series of events, the psychiatrist recommended (April 6, 1978) that
Mr. C should "continue with current medications", even though he was
receiving none, because he was "adjusting well to modular”. with documentation

such as exists at Pennhurst, the psychiatrist's confusion is hardly surprising.

III. Programming

In the above section of this report we emphasized inappropriate and poorly-
informed use of psychotropic drugs at Pennhurst; we did so because such prac-
tices are generally symptomatic of inadequate program planning and program
execution. Developmentally disabled people are often unable to arrange their
environment to suit their emotional needs, and resort instead to maladaptive
behaviors. Using drugs to suppress these behaviors may serve as a convenient
substitute for programs designed to help alleviate disability, but the long-
term result is that disability is perpetuated rather than relieved.

Psychotropic medication is overused, and used as a substitute for program

on a large scale at Pennhurst. In Quaker Hall (second floor) twelve records

were reviewed. Eleven individuals were on psychoactive drugs, and one of

these, R _ _G , was on five psychoactive drugs simultaneously. In no
instance of any record examined was there documentation of less restrictive
methods of behavior modification being tried, nor did any of the annual

Program Reviews reflect any serious attempt to address the issue of replacing
psychoactive drugs with more constructive forms of behavior management. Indeed,
the annual Reviews are so lacking in medical input (other than routine health-
maintenance nursing matters) that we have the impression that Pennhurst
physicians are not really looked upon as part of the program team, but rather

as detached professionals whose actions are beyond the realm of team discussion.

Finally, we noted that the Pennhurst infirmary is being used as a "last

resort" placement for residents who continue to exhibit unmanageable behaviors
despite drugging. In the absence of even a trial of a program of carefully
designed behavior management, this practice is clearly highly restrictive

and inappropriate.

IV. Health—related environmental issues

One of the most serious problems observed, and noted from the records,
which affects not only the mental and physical health of the residents but
also their continuing general development and well—being, was their universal
and all-pervasive idleness. While ultimately affecting residents‘ emotional
and intellectual development, the most immediate and obvious effects are
accident, injury, self—abuse, and abuse by staff. We observed repeated
instances of staff abusing residents by shouting across the room to residents
and to one another - a form of abuse which while it may be unintentional is
one against which many residents have little defense, and little capacity to
respond except through self—stimulation and other maladaptive behaviors. The
abundance of aberrant behavior is a sign of Pennhurst's emotionally depriving
environment. A

We observed one lunchtime meal in Capitol Hall I, and saw a number of
problems. Many wheelchairs were not properly adapted either for posture or
for use at mealtime: some were too high to fit under the tables, requiring
their users to reach too far to feed themselves comfortably; in others a
built-on tray was so high as to make self-feeding awkward. Unsupervised steal-
ing of food was noted. ‘Non-self-feeding residents were being fed hurriedly,
using the dangerous technique of raking food off spoons by drawing them
upwards over the upper teeth — an open invitation to choking and aspiration.
Rarely could we locate prescriptions for proper amounts of fluid intake, or
records of urinary output.

V. Record—keeping practices

We have already mentioned two problems encountered in Pennhurst's record

system: lengthy gaps in records, and use of different forms for annual

bphysicals, at least one of which is not suited for that use. Another problem

Report of Visit — Pennhurst Center _ Page 10

is the way seizure records are kept. Staff members are instructed to record
seizures individually on small slip—like forms which are later taped into the’
record, often mixed in with laboratory reports and other forms of similar
size. While the convenience of this system may help insure that seizures

are in fact recorded, we suspect that it may also be detrimental to medical

management: instead of being able to see a running summary of seizures written

down inla single place, the physician, in order to observe trends in seizure

frequency and thus to correllate them with previous modifications of anti-

convulsant regimens, must riffle through page after page of slips, abstracting
dates along the way. Such a procedure is time consuming, and ultimately must
interfere with timely and comprehensive anticonvulsant review. The fact that
numerous deaths from seizures have occurred at Pennhurst suggests that this
record—keeping practice is not only inconvenient but dangerous as well.
Physician progress notes are extremely difficult to follow because they

are kept in different places, using different forms. Infirmary progress notes
may or may not be on a form provided for that purpose; residential unit notes
are kept on at least two different forms, one of which contains parallel
columns for notes and orders, the other being for notes only. Physicians and
nurses alike use these forms, and many of the nurses’ notes appear to be
substitutes for physician notes (for example, the nurse might record that

"Dr. Jones examined Mary because of fever. He found such—and—such and pre-
scribed so-and—so". This practice we consider hazardous, and believe that it
should be used only in unusual circumstances, such as when the physician is

called to another area for an emergency before being able to record his own

findings. The net effect of these progress note practices is to fragment the

_record of the resident's care, making it difficult to audit and difficult to use,

particularly for "after hours’ physicians who may not have continuing familiarity

with the case.

VII. Recommendations

VI. Summary and Conclusions

Medical care at Pennhurst, for a variety of reasons, is inadequate.
Viewed in terms of traditional medical care, Pennhurst residents do not
receive periodic comprehensive assessment of their condition, their progress,
and their long and short term medical needs. This leads, for example, to
rote reordering of and exposure to side effects of drugs for which the

original need has long since become obscure; inattentive seizure management;

‘failure to evaluate chronic life—threatening conditions which may be highly

treatable; and failure to take effective action to eliminate known life-
threatening behavior.

In terms of contemporary standards of practice in a residential facility
for the retarded, medical services at Pennhurst suffer most on account of
almost total lack of participation in an interdisciplinary process of
resident program planning, implementation, and review. The single most
pervasive effect is that maladaptive behaviors are overwhelmingly dealt with
by use of psychotropic drugs, which do nothing to promote development and
may actually retard it, rather than by using behavioral and educational pro-
grams which if well-designed and carefully implemented can be a powerful
adjunct to promoting development. The problem is compounded, however, by
the apparent lack of the other services crucial to implementation of the
interdisciplinary model, and by a sense of professional distance — even

antagonism - between Pennhurst's physicians and its other disciplines.

Many observations are offered in the sections above whose need for
corrective action, and the nature of that action, will be readily apparent.
Those offered below are intended to complement the foregoing.

Provide a continuum of "sensitivity" raising medical grand rounds_
monthly for one year. 'Then the effectiveness of this, including

the need to continue, should be evaluated.

Provide a mandatory continuing education program for all physicians,
emphasizing the interdisciplinary and developmental models. These
programs are offered in many of the so—called University-Affiliated
Centers.

Physicians‘ case loads should be no more than 100 clients.

Use of separate physicians for night coverage should be discontinued.
Physician assistants might be employed full time to assist in night
coverage,as well as for other "physician—extender” functions
including interdisciplinary team meetings.
Verbal orders by physicians should be minimized. when orders are
written, the purpose of the order, expected’results, and the more
frequent side effects of the drug, if pertinent, should be recorded.
Progress notes of all disciplines, including physicians, should be
melded, whenever possible, to present a more accurate and meaningful
status report of the resident.
A critical review of long term medication should be done at least
monthly, stating the purpose of the drug, results,-and reason for
continuing the drug.

There should be a monthly review of accidents, injuries, etc. for
the purpose of instignting general preventive measures. Some of
these might be the addition of programs (particularly behavioral
programs), removal of hazards (slippery floors, etc.), better staff
coverage at critical periods (getting up in the morning, bathing,

feeding, etc.)

A clearer definition of use of outside resources such as outside

hospitals, consultants, elective surgery, restorative surgery, etc.

should be developed by the medical staff.

Ward records should be regularly reviewed for continuity, clarity,

and pertinence.

The service of a nutritionist should be obtained to assist in

ordering individualized diets from a standpoint of total calories,

protein, fat, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, consistency,

liquid intake, etc.

Staff who feed residents need special training in feeding techniques.

Provision should be made for adaptive equipment including, but not

limited to, wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, braces, feeding devices,

etc.

Monitoring of the use of psychotropic drugs should be considered at

the meeting scheduled for July 21, 1980.
