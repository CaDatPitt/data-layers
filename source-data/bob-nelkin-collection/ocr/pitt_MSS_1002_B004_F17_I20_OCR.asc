Re: Firing of Supt. McClelland

Dear Secretary Wohlgemuth:

As you know, our organization is involved in active day-to-day work with
mental patients in the Philadelphia area and at Haverford State Hospital.
We are most concerned about assuring that institutional conditions and
-administrators support the welfare and rights of patients.

Because of our concern, we wish to express total support for your decision

' to order the dismantling of the "cages/pens" at the Polk institution and
the firing of its superintendent. We feel that this action was most
consistent with your duties as Secretary gf Public Welfare. We hope that,
_despite the criticism of you from some quarters, you will remain steadfast
in your resolve to end this and other inhumane practices in state schools and
hospitals. -

If we can be of any assistance to you in this area, please do not hesitate
to contact us.

‘yﬁly.
