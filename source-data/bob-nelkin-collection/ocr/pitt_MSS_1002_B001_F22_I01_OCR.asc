CASE MANAGEMENT

INTRODUCTION

One of the most important and vital needs of the mentally
retarded population is to be assisted in the choice of appropri-
ate programming and in securing adequate public support when
requested by or in behalf of the retarded person. To insure
continuity of quality services and progression in the develop-
ment of the individual, as well as the best use of the public
dollar in behalf of the individual, an organized system of case
management is essential. It is evident that an effective,
efficient and beneficial program can be realized only through a
competent and identifiable case management component. It is:
important that case management be seen from the outset as a
program component standing free of any diagnostic label (MH, MR,
etc.). A pre-labeled case management system runs the risk of
aaprioridecision making and referrals that can have life-long
effects on an individual. ' t

The description of case management must include the follow-
ing elements as a minimum:

1. Intake: to determine whether and what kind of service
is needed and to enter one into the program system
rendering them eligible for public support. Included
as elements of intake are: the gathering of technical
information such as medical, social and educational
data; personal information; liability determination
where appropriate; and supportive counseling. Emphasis
must be placed, at this point of contact between indivi-
dual and/or family and the case manager, on the impor-
tance of attitudes projected by the case manager in the
intake interview. It is at this time that persons
needing assistance are most sensitive and anxious and
are in need of solid support and understanding.

2. Arrangement for diagnosis and evaluation: to insure
accurate determination of needs and appropriate evalua-
tion that would provide a base for the individual
program plan, including goal plans and appropriate
service referral.

3. Formulation of Individual Program Plan: to be based on

the current need assessment and to be formulated in a
timely fashion in conjunction with the person needing
service and, where and when appropriate, with family
and other concerned individuals, e.g. guardians, personal

,_ . advocates, agency personnel, public school administra-
tors and teachers, etc.

4. Service referral: to result from an evaluation of

service options by individual and/or family with the
assistance of the case management staff. '

I3

Supervision of continuity of care: to insure that
adequate and appropriate services are being delivered
at all times in behalf of the individual and/or family
and to concretize the lines of accountability between
the County Program and the private and public service
providers from whom services are being purchased. This
includes ongoing contact with individuals, families and
service providers.

éﬁ,

Arrangement for discharge from program system: to
involve all appropriate parties and to result from an
agreement that such an arrangement is appropriate. This
is to include a plan for adaptation in the community
including degree and kind of support, by whom, and how
frequently.

Responsibility for the provision<mfcase management services
should rest with the governmental agency responsible for the
provision of services since case management is one means by which
this agency is to be held accountable. If the County is to have
responsibility for providing services, it is also to be held
accountable to the public for the kinds and quality of services
purchased. The County must have clear responsibility for and
control over the case management component of the program. The
case manager, therefore, should be the agent of the County Office
in the community, whose responsibility is to ensure the provision
and continuance of needed programs. In this way, all case manage-
ment responsibilities are carried out for the County Office and
in behalf of the consumer, and not for any provider agency. It
is, therefore, imperative that case management be separated from
provider of service agencies in those programs where such a union
exists.

(

Services are purchased in and from the community by the case
manager for the County and can be graphically stated as follows:

Accountability will be realized through an effective report-
ing system between the County Office and the case manager, and
between the case manager and service providers. Accountability
is both fiscal and programmatic. The case manager, as agent of
the County Office, should have the authority either to authorize
or submit to the County Administrator authorizations for services

"based on the need assessment and individual program plan, as well

as an evaluation of the quality of service being authorized. All
purchase—of-service dollars should pass through and be controlled
by the County through the case management system which should
consequently be accountable for the expenditure of those funds.

To make sure that the services being purchased are of good
quality and of benefit to the individual, there must also be
program accountability on the part of the County Office through
the case manager. A systematized reporting system must exist
that flows from the provider agency to the case manager and back,
with authorizations of service being renewed on the basis of
those reports. Such reports should be done on each individual
in a program at least once every six months. The context of the
report, to take the general form of progress reporting and goal
planning, is to provide the base for the continual updating of
the individual program plan.

Various options should be available to each individual
County as to the determination of the best method of carrying
out its case management responsibility. Currently this is being
done differently throughout Pennsylvania. In one County, case
management for the County program is totally centralized, both
administration and staff, and it is carried out by the central-
ized provider agency for the County. In another County, case
management is totally decentralized and is carried out by several
independent private provider-of-service agencies, each one
covering a defined geographical area. In still another County,
case management is totally a County operation.

For the proper and orderly fulfillment of the case manage-

-ment responsibility, however, the administrative and managerial

function should be performed centrally while maintaining a
deployed staff in the community, assigned to specific geographic
areas. In this way, focus is sharpened on the community in its
role of providing services for its members, accessibility to
service is heightened, and adequate fiscal and programmatic
control for accountability purposes is maintained.

Whether this centralized case management function is carried
out by staff in the County or by staff employed by a central
private agency accountable to the County Office can be determined
by thetcounty. '
