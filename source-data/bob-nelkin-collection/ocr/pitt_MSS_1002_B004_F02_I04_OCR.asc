‘POLICY

ABUSIVE TREATMENT OF RESIDENTS

I am sure that the policy at Polk State School since its beginning
has been that no resident be physically or psychologically abused in any way.

I would like to restate this policy at this time to clarify the responsibili-
ties that all Staff at Polk State School has in regard to this matter.

Physical or psychological abuse has no place in the program, treat-
ment or care of the mentally retarded. Therefore, corporal punishment is not
permitted.

Psychological abuse constitutes actions such as verbally degrading
residents, using residents as the butt of jokes, creating untenable situations
which a resident hasrx>recourse but to over-react, etc.

Our responsibility is to constantly strive towards the development
of a psychologically positive environment plus relating to all residents in a
positive responsive way. All Staff not only has the responsibility of follow-
ing this policy in their own actions, but also has the responsibility to stop
others‘ actions which are abusive to residents, or reporting same to your
imediate supervisor.

Our emloyment at Polk State School is only justified relative to the
programs and services that we provide to the mentally retarded and their families.

I expect that all Staff will adhere to the above stated.policy without exception.
