RE: Recommendations to Close Admissions at Western State School and Hospital

Because the overcrowding and understaffing at Western State School and
Hospital results in daily injury or death and inadequate care of the
residents, the Allegheny County Chapter, Pennsylvania Association for
Retarded Citizens demands the closing of all admissions and immediate
.reduction of overcrowding.

Admissions should remain closed until the "total care" lodges comply
with the minimum standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Hospitals (JCAH) and Federal Medical Assistance (MA). This means the
lodges must meet Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals staff/
resident ratio and maximum population requirements.

The Allegheny County Chapter, Pennsylvania Association for Retarded
Citizens insists that immediate alternatives be created by the Depart-
ment of Public Welfare and Mental Health/Mental Retardation for men-
tally retarded citizens who are also severely physically or emotionally
handicapped. or whose family needs respite care.

The Allegheny County Chapter, Pennsylvania Association for Retarded
Citizens will assist with the Development of Residential Alternatives
and will obtain legal counsel to aid the Department of Public Welfare to
fight MH/MR or Juvenile court ordered comitments.
