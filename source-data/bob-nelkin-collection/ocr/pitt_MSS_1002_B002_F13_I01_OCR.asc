Dear Governor Thornburgh:

;; am writing to urge you to reconsider your recent decision to appea1 the Pennhurst Case to

':the Supreme Court in the event the Broderick decision 15 uphe1d at the Appe11ate 1eve1.

During your campaign you shared with me what you be1ieved to be seven major prob1ems facing
your Administration and this Association. The two which stand out most c1ear1y in my mind
from your September 15, 1978 1etter are: (1) “the need to deve1op community programs to

serve the 1east ab1e and hardest to.hand1e peop1e" and (2) "the need to drastica11y reduce

- waste and make better use of tax do11ars to improve the qua1ity of_services." we hearti1y

"greed with these statements and 1ooked to the Thornburgh Administration with hope and con-
iidence that it wou1d maximize a11 opportunities to improve the 1ives of menta11y retarded
peop1e. ’ V V .

On February 13, 1979, I wrote to you expressing our growing concerns about 1osing momentum
to.carry our goa1s forward. Our fears have been borne out in recent weeks when your decision
was announced to appea1 the first imp1ementing order in the Pennhurst case. Our fear turned

to a1arm when your Department of Pub1ic He1fare Secretary toid the Senate Appropriations Com-
‘ mittee on Apri1 18 that in the event.the State 1ost its case at the Appe11ate 1eve1, it wou1d

continue its efforts to appea1 to the U.S. Supreme Court. We understand and concur in your

phi1osophy that the Department of Pub1ic Ne1fare must take a 1eadership ro1e in setting po1icy

and insuring the provision of qua1ity menta1 retardation services.

However, we be1ieve you are 1osing a va1uab1e opportunity to use a court decision with which
you have no phi1osophica1 differences as a 1ever to bring about rea1 change. The Department
of Pub1ic we1fare shou1d embrace the Pennhurst decision and take the 1ead in imp1ementing the
;ubsequent orders. Menta11y retarded persons wi11 not benefit by another three to five years
court batt1e which wi11 sure1y ensue if the decision continues to be appea1ed.

Because the Appe11ate Court decision can be expected at any time now, we fee1 it is most ur-

gent to meet and discuss with you in greater detaii our concerns regarding your position to
appea1.

we continue to be1ieve you are committed to fu1fi11ing the promises of your campaign. we
want to work with you and other members of your Administration to rea1ize the fu11 deve1op—
ment of appropriate community programs.

He anxicu=1v await your response to our request for a Sﬁ€C1&l meeting with you.

SinCere1y,
