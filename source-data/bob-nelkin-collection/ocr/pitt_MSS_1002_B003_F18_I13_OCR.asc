Dear Commissioner Carroll:

We are writing to request that the agenda for the State Task Force
meeting on January 23rd be expanded to include a presentation by the Departments
of Education and Welfare on building and construction programs at state schools
-and hospitals.

It has come to our attention that building construction programs are
at the advanced planning stage for several of the state schools. We are alarmed
and opposed to what we hear and feel that P.A.R.C. deserves an explanation for this
state—wide movement.

Our opposition to the rumors and partial disclosures is twofold. First
of all, the construction of educational facilities at state schools and hospitals
represents a reinstitutionalization that is counter-productive to the accepted
goals of deinstitutionalization and normalization. There seems to be an erroneous
assumption that profoundly retarded and multiply handicapped students cannot be
transported to a community school or that such transportation is not beneficial.

We suggest that where transportation has been attempted that it is both feasible and
beneficial.

And second, the construction of education facilities at state schools
and hospitals should be reconsidered in light ot the Right to Education Consent
Agreement. Prior to this Agreement, there was an administrative arrangement whereby
residents at state schools and hospitals received all of their services including
education from a staff that had some accountability to each other by virtue of being
accountable to a superintendent. This model had all the appearances of being able
to provide a coordinated program for all the needs of the students, but as agreed to
in the Consent Agreement the existing administrative arrangement failed to meet the
educational needs of the students. Now that the educational responsibilities have
been assigned to the Intermediate Unit, we expect the same degree of quality of
educational instruction curriculum development and ancillary services for all retarded
