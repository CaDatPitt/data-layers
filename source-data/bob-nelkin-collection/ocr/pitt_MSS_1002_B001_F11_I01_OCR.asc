ject and several patients and ex-patients as a result of Haver-

ford State Hospital's ouster of the project after a year in which .

and outside the institution: the right to peaceful assembly: the
right to organize a patient/ resident government; the right to
receive visitors of their own choosing daily. including civil

The Department of the Public Advocate of the New

amicus brief in the New Jersey Supreme Court following the
county's appeal from an order (1) declaring an involuntary
commitment order null and void for failure to hold a hearing
as to mental illness. (2) establishing a procedure to be filed in
future involuntary civil commitment hearings, and (3) making
the appointment of independent counsel mandatory in all
such hearings and providing for appointed counsel to

in the proceedings. and that an organized counsel service is
preferable to assigned counsel because lforganized counsel
has proven to be more economical. more eflicient. and more
protective of constitutional rights than had been assigned
counsel.” Amicus argues that since the state legislature has
established the Division of Mental Health Advocacy to
provide “such legal representation and medical consultation
as the director deems appropriate for any indigent mental
hospital admittee in any proceeding concerning the admit-
tee's admission to, retention in. or release from confinement
in” a mental institution. it is the appropriate agency to
provide representation in all involuntary commitment pro-
ceedings should the court find a constitutional right to
counsel. . ‘

INGHOUSE REV. 573 (Dec. 1974).) '

In a previous order. thecourt found that the only
institution within the state capable of caring for a severely
retarded 13-year-old girl was so grossly overcrowded and
understaffed that such placement would be detrimental to the
child. who had a constitutional right to treatment. and
ordered the county Child Welfare Services Department and
the county Mental Health/Mental Retardation Unit to
cooperate in finding a foster home for the child. These
departments found a suitable foster home for the child. but a
disagreement arose between the county Child Services
Department _and the state welfare department as to who
should pay the per diem costs paid to the foster parents. The
court found that under the state Mental Health and Mental
Retardation Act. the state welfare department is obligated to

_providc for citirens with mental disabilities and thus has tll_S_

Opinion (10pp.).] -
Appellant. a former mental patient who had contracted

hospitals at which she had been a patient asking them to send
her copies of her records so that she could verify her
recollections of various incidents. The hospitals refused her
request. Appellant claimed that this denial violated her first.

court, granting. defendants’ motion for summary‘ judgment.
held that former mental patients have no first amendment
right to receive information contained in their hospital
records; that the fourth amendment prohibition of unreason-
able searches and seizures is inapplicable; that plaintiff
enjoyed no right to privacy entitling her to her records for
purposes of publishing a book; and_that plaintiff had not been
deprived of “liberty" or “property” protected by the due-
process clause of the fourteenth amendment.

The Second’ Circuit, affirming the lower court's
decision, found ‘that existing case law regarding hospital
records indicates that although patients have certain rights in
their records, this right does not include an absolute property
right with unrestricted access. Furthermore. New York
statutory law establishes that while patients may exercise a
considerable degree of control over their records,” they do not
have the right to demand direct access to them. As to
appellant's deprivation of liberty argument. the court found
that appellant was not being stigmatized by the defendants
and that no one had branded her as mentally ill or otherwise.

Seventh Circuit Orders Convening of Three-Judge
Court to Determine Constitutionality of Portion of

Children of Indigent Patients to Pay for Their
Parents’ Support .. _ .

15,277. Wojcik Y. Levitt, No. 74-1661 (7th Cir., April 9.
1975). Plaintiff represented by Thomas Grippando, Chicago
Legal Aid Bureau. 64 E. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Ill. 60604,
(312) 922-5625; Chester Lizak, 7 S. Dearborn St.. Chicago,
Ill. [Here reported: 15,277A Opinion (8pp.).}

Plaintiff brought this action challenging Section 12-12
of the Illinois Mental Health Code which provides that child-
ren of indigent parents who are receiving treatment from the
Department of Mental Health must pay up to $30 per month
for the support of such parent. He argues that the require-
ment that children of public assistance recipients make
contributions to their parent's support was abolished in 1967
and that to single out only the children of indigent mental
patients as legally responsible relatives is a denial of equal
protection. The district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint.
concluding that plaintiffs attacks on the constitutionality of
Section 12-12 were “obviously without merit."

The Seventh Circuit reversed the lower court's decision
and found that plaintiffs challenge cannot be termed "wholly
insubstantial" or “obviously frivolous." Although the court
stated that it did not wish to suggest that a rational explana-
tion for the apparent discrimination does not exist. it noted

' that no explanation is clear upon the face of the statutes in-
volved. and defendant's counsel did not provide one. The
court found that at least one of plaintiffs constitutional
arguments has suflicient substance to meet the standards set
forth in Gooshy v. Ossvr, 409 U.S. 512. and that therefore,

The court found no merit to the argument of the City of
New York that. since it has closed the Manhattan House of
Detention (The Tombs). the court has no power to grant relief
to the plaintiffs who were originally housed there but have
been relocated to the Rikers Island House of Detention for
Men. or that a trial de now must be held. It noted that the
Second Circuit had affirmed its earlier decision. which not
only made ﬁndings of fact as to conditions at the Tombs but
also determined the standards of protection to which

detainees are entitled. Further. the Second Circuit. although ’
probably not contemplating the closing of the Tombs. stated  -

that. given the tortuous history of the litigation. “the district
judge should not allow another trial on" the merits of plaintiffs’

claim or countenance any signiﬁcant delay in fashioning *
