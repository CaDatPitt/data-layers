WESTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL
LIAISON COMMITTEE MEETING

Thursday, September 25, 1975

Dr. Craig Mulvihill, the dentist, was the guest.

Dr. Mulvihill: October 1974 the anogesa program began.
Delayed several months due to state red
tape.

Only one person would not allow the tranquilizer to be
put in the vain (I.V. sedation). Valium and demorel are
used. A local anesthesa is used.

Dr. Scott: Questioned how 50 fillings on one person
would be recorded in medical report. She never saw more
than 6 to 8 fillings on the monthly report.

Dr. Mulvihill: It was a while ago, several months back,
when we had so many fillings in one month.

Alice Goldberg: Would you extract a tooth without parentsâ€˜
permission?

Dr. Mulvihill: Depending upon whether I could get parents.
If I can't get parents, I will extract without permission.

Question: Is a surgical consent needed?

Dr. Mulvihill: Before we do an I.V. sedation, we will get
a surgical consent.

Jack M.: How often will residents be seen by dentist?

Dr. Mulvihill: Lodge residents once every three/four months.
Once every six months for cottage residents. We periodically
review our files to pick up residents who we missed.

Jack M. & Harry G.: A heated discussion about DPW's failure
to hire according to legislation 75-A occurred, tabled.

Dr. Mulvihill: You don't need as much cooperation from patient
for an extraction as a filling.

Dr. Mulvihill: I give the attendants a pep talk when they first
come into the institution (attendant training).

Jack M.: How often do we have prophelactyc exams done on the
residents?

Dr. Mulvihill: At every examination, there is prophelactyc and
flouride treatment done.

Question: Is there a record of extractions per month?

Dr. Mulvihill: Yes, in the medical department's report.

Question: If there use to be two dentists and now there is
one, they why has this come about?

Dr. Mulvihill: No answer. But I guess they felt if I was
crazy enough to stay here, there wasn't a need for a second
person. Crazy because the patients are so hard to work with.

Alice G.: How about using residents personal funds to get
outside dental care instead of buying furniture or losing
it to the state?

Dr. Scott: It is a good idea, I will look into it.

Question: Is it possible to give parents an option to be
consulted if work needs done?

Dr. Scott: Where we cannot get a hold of a parent or guardian
in three days, then permission is granted by Superintendent
and Commissioner to do a surgical operation.

Question: Do you have an adequate amount of equipment?

Dr. Mulvihill: Need one lounge chair for general anesthetic,
a high speed suction, small head high speed hand piece.

Question: Could a volunteer straighten up your follow-up system
which has broken down?

Dr. Mulvihill: A volunteer would probably get it screwed up.

Jack M. & Dr. Mulvihill: Fought over whether Dr. M. should com-
promise the number of visits because of transportation difficulties.

Jack M.: Dr. Scott should Dr. Mulvihill be in the transportation
business?

Dr. Scott: No.
Dr. Mulvihill: We only miss 1 or 2%.
Parent: If that 1% missed is my child, that is 100%.

Alice G.: Is standing table exercise a legitimate reason to miss
an exam?

Dr. Mulvihill: No, the reason was those little bugs were flying
around and I don't need lice in the dental office.

Alice G.: It sounds like you still just see what's wrong but don't
take care of the care that's needed.

Dr. Mulvihill: That's right. Because we don't have a general
anesthesia program.

Jack M. & Dr. Mulvihill: Discussed intensely the lack of an
organized program. Dr. Mulvihill agreed that the (dental)
program is a failure.

Dr. Scott: What kind of help can we get from Dr. Forest, Dean
of Dental School.

Dr. Mulvihill: As soon as we get a power cord and get general
anesthetic consent from parents, we will do one a day (twice a
week).

Question: Can we get the Pitt Dental Clinic to work on some
of our residents?

Dr. Scott: Yes. Dean Forest will help us.

Question: How about contacting community dentists and HCC
for assistance?

Jack M.: We need to know what the program is.

Alice G.: will you, Dr. Mulvihill, devise a plan of what is
needed for adequate dental care?

Question: How do you get those men and women who work?

Dr. Mulvihill: Once every six months, I will see the people working
late at night.

Question: Is there an impacted wisdom teeth problem?
Dr. Mulvihill: Panarex x-rays showed impacted wisdom teeth.

Question: Periocart - do you still need one? How is the oral
care?

Dr. Mulvihill: A marked improvement in oral care as a result
of Right to Education.

Dr. Scott: In the areas of Right to Education, it should be
done each day.

Dr. Mulvihill: The periocart is in storage.
