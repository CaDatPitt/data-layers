A Statement By

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

Wednesday, May 10, 1978

  

Ihave a vision of what our Commonwealth

can be:

- a state rid of the destructive inﬂuences of
organized crime and corruption;

- a state with highways and bridges safe for
travel and commerce;

- a state with a ﬁrst-rate educational system;

- a state whose economy is ﬂourishing, not
withering;

- above all, a state in which citizens can plan for
the future with hope and conﬁdence.

This vision for Pennsylvania encompasses all
citizens - rich and poor, young and old, male and
female — a state in which the rights of all are
protected so that the future for each is secure.

Too often some of our citizens have been
excluded from this vision. Too often handicapped
individuals or older people reside on the outskirts
of hope. I believe each citizen ought to be able to
live in dignity. Each citizen ought to be able to
make whatever contribution to society his or her
unique talents allow. And each ought to have a
productive place in our Commonwealth.

I want to see a state government that supports
an environment to encourage the creative
energies of all. To do less is to deprive society of
talents and experience we greatly need. And I
want to see those unable to care for themselves
cared for equitably. To do less is to divide people
into ﬁrst-class and second-class citizens. It is the
role of our human services system to promote
growth, opportunity, and security for all our
citizens.

Today this system is almost a non-system.
We have a vast, impersonal bureaucracy that
shuttles people from one agency to another for
different services. For example, our older
citizens receive free transit through the
Department of Transportation, rent rebates from
the Department of Revenue, medical assistance
from the Department of Welfare and reside in
nursing homes regulated by the Department of
Health.

Moreover, we find particular needs
ministered to by several different agencies. For
example, educational programs are administered
not only by the Department of Education, but by
the Departments of Community Affairs, Labor
and Industry, and Public Welfare as well.
Finally, we persist in separating people into
stereotyped categories for providing services.
Thus, we ﬁnd one group in society competing
with another for scarce resources.

We must end this competition among groups
by recognizing the difﬁculties that one individual

encounters are shared by others: the need for
adequate health care, the need for suitable living
arrangements, the need for educational
opporttmities, and the need for a productive
place in society.

Today, I want to share my vision of the
human services we as a state must extend to our
citizens, the new attitudes we must cultivate, the
new directions we must take.

The promise for handicapped individuals is
one of which my wife, Ginny, and I have special
knowledge. Our 18-year-old son, Peter, who lives
with us, was brain damaged as a result of a car
accident some years ago. Through him, I know
the problems that handicapped people face. I also
know their potential for growth, their potential
for independence — for I have seen it ﬁrst-hand.

Peter is one of some 365,000 Pennsylvanians
who are mentally retarded citizens, 3% of our
population. We must give real hope that these
citizens can take their rightful places in society.
Ginny and I have no more precious dream than
one in which Peter ﬁnds a job and gains a
measure of his own independence and personal
fulﬁllment. I know we share this dream with
thousands of other parents in Pennsylvania.

The President's Commission on Mental
Health revealed only two weeks ago that more
than 2 million Americans suffer from depression
and at least 15% of all Americans need some
form of mental health treatment. Mental
disorders strike anyone - and we must remove
the barriers in society that cause us to ignore or
exclude mentally restored citizens from the full
ﬂow of community life.

Some 450,000 Pennsylvanians are physically
handicapped. They form a vast resource of talent
and skill that has not been tapped. Why?
Because they frequently encounter urmecessary
physical barriers and the subtle hostile attitudes
of others blocking them from productive pursuits.

Our older citizens also discover obstacles to
fruitful lives. The income of retired citizens is
often but a fraction of what it was before they

retired, making it more difﬁcult to own or retain
their own homes and to pursue recreational
opportunities.

We can ill afford second-class citizenship of
any kind in Pennsylvania. We must pursue
fundamental objectives to make fulﬁlling lives a
reality for everyone.

First, we must destroy the stereotypes that
inhibit us from seeing individual people with
particular needs. Our tendency to group people
into homogeneous categories distorts the reality
of the circumstances and potential of each
individual. Among the mentally retarded, for
example, only ﬁve percent are severely or
profoundly affected, while eighty-nine percent
are classiﬁed as mildly retarded.

Even among the severely affected, there is a
real potential for growth. For example, while
Ginny served as President of the Allegheny
County Chapter of the Pennsylvania Association
for Retarded Children, she met a young girl
named Joyce, a severely retarded and multiply
handicapped child totally dependent on others.
Ginny helped place Joyce in a foster home. In this
new home, Joyce is receiving love and making
major gains, including taking her ﬁrst steps in
four years. Had Joyce been shunted aside by
society as a hopeless case, then she indeed might
have become hopeless.

To assure that hope is not destroyed, we
must destroy the self-fulﬁlling stereotypes that
conﬁne people to irredeemable categories. We
must treat people as unique and individual, not
as homogeneous groups.

Second, we must assure that proper living
arrangements are available to match each
person’s needs. I believe the best atmosphere is
created in a loving home. And that is where we
ought to concentrate -- on enabling individuals to
live in their own home and neighborhood.

Where this isn't possible or desirable, then
it is best for people to be able to live in a setting
where they are part of a community in which they
can participate. But, neither home or community

living arrangements are best for everyone.
Sometimes specialized institutions may be the
most desirable alternative. We should make
certain these institutions provide quality care and
dignity to the individual and are adequately
staffed by competent and compassionate
professionals.

There are many ways to achieve our goal of
giving people the choice of remaining in their
own homes. Many families with handcapped
children need supportive services in their homes
to keep their families together. And older people
face the special problems of being forced from
their homes by rising property taxes, especially
for education, and inadequate in-home services.
The phase-out of our present property tax for
education purposes, the acceleration of in-home
care and home-making services to solve problems
that might otherwise require a nursing home,
and the continuation of our commitment to
support services to give our older citizens the
mobility and nutrition they need will help solve
these special problems.

Our objective must be to insure that a variety
of living arrangements are available in which
responsible people can make choices as to which
best suits their needs.

Third, we must assure educational
opportunities to help people develop according to
their abilities. If our handicapped citizens are to
grow, they must have an education that prepares
them for the future. For any person to assume a
productive place in society, he or she must have
knowledge and skills.

In October, 1977, the United States
Department of Health, Education and Welfare
ordered schools to provide free appropriate
public education for all handicapped children.
This year, state government will spend in excess
of $370 million to achieve this goal. We must
re-afﬁrm this commitment so that the talents of
these people are not wasted or undeveloped.

Fourth, we must ﬁnd opportunities for
productive work. Compassionate care, appro-
priate living arrangements and education
unfairly build false expectations when a person is
not allowed to utilize knowledge and skills
productively. The dream of finding a place in the
mainstream of society and thus gaining dignity
and independence will be shattered if we do not
provide suitable work.

For instance, many citizens who have
suffered from an attack of mental illness, but are
now mentally restored, are already educated or
trained in skills. But the public needs to be
educated to accept the mentally restored back
into jobs suitable to those skills.

I will ensure that the Department of Labor

 

and Industry exerts greater efforts to counsel and
place our handicapped citizens in productive
jobs. Our efforts will be empty if the growth we
encourage, the hope we inspire is not matched by
commitment to make full and productive use of
that growth and hope.

As we review human service goals, we begin
to realize that people are much more alike than
different in their basic needs. People want to be
treated as individuals. They want loving homes in
secure neighborhoods. They want an education
that will lead to_ ﬁnancial security.

To institute new attitudes and new
directions, my first priority as governor in the
realm of human services will be to assure that
efforts of the various agencies in state
government are coordinated and cooperatively
undertaken.

Right now, some twelve different state
agencies ranging from the Department of
Agriculture to the Department of Transportation
are responsible in one way or another for human
services. This chaotic situation is expensive and
insensitive to people's needs and must be
brought under control.

My ﬁrst action would not be to create
another committee or commission. Rather, I will
insist that the highest levels of executive ofﬁcers,
including the Secretaries of Public Welfare,
Health, Labor and Industry, Revenue, Com-
munity Affairs, Education and Transportation
stop the endless bickering over proposals and
work together to clean up the bureaucratic mess
and cut through the red tape that prolongs
problems and prevents solutions.

Fmther, I will insist on better communica-
tion between those serving and those being
served. Our citizens should influence the
decisions and policies that affect them. And I
would insure the many good human service
employes have the leadership and skills they
need to do their jobs and be responsive to the
needs of the people they serve. I will direct that
all-out efforts be made to secure safe and suitable
living arrangements, to provide the education
necessary, and to place people in jobs that will
give them the chance to support themselves and
contribute to their community.

I speak for attitudes and directions to seize a
new vision of our human services. We must see
people as whole, not as fragments. We_ must end
stereotypes. We must stress what we have in
common, rather than insist upon our differences.
We are, after all, a Commonwealth. We have
more in common than we often admit and surely
we have a wealth of untapped talent only waiting
to be encouraged.

I believe we can begin anew with the election

of a governor who understands our people. And I
intend to be that kind of governor, a governor of
all the people.

I want to see a state that provides
opportunity for the handicapped.

I want a state that seeks productive lives for
our retarded citizens, providing training and jobs
so they can take their rightful place in society.

I want a state that recognizes mental illness
is not a stigma, but an illness from which a
person can be fully restored.

I want a state that breaks down attitudinal as
well as physical barriers for the physically
handicapped.

I want a state that assures our elderly have
fulﬁlling lives.

I want a state that is compassionate,
concerned and committed to making the lives of
each citizen in our Commonwealth, lives ﬁlled
with opportunity and hope, not disillusionment
and despair. As governor, I promise to strive to
achieve this vision, to enrich the lives of our
citizens and thus, in turn, to enrich our entire
state.
