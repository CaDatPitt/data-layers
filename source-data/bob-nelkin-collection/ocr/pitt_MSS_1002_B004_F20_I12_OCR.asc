Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth,
I am writing this letter as the
mother of a mentally retarded child in
i a state school.
ii We had to place our child in a state
1 school.
We were unable to manage her. We
9 felt so helpless placing her in the state
school.
3 it was like a nightmare, and another
3 nightmare to live with her.
For the first time since we have
placed her at the state school. 1 feel
i hope.
Thank you for the fantastic job you
_ are doing.
i We, think you are wonderful.
Q The time has come for change.
