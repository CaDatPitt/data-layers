Polk State School and Hospital,

Polk, '

Pennsylvania

ATTENTION: Dr. James R. Mcclelland
SUBJECT: Nancy 

., We great1y_appreciated your understanding of my needs last Saturday,

September 23, Circus Day, when I found it necessary to request your
intervention and take exception to the rule you apparently have with
respect to phone communications between patients and parents.

Quite frankly, Dr. Mcclelland, while I well realize your large
institution is operating under your supervision as you deem it best,
nonetheless, rules such as total prohibition of phone communications
between patients and parents are questionable when the only basis '”
for such rules seem to relate to lack of adequate switchboard and/or

' coin telephone facilities.

I quite appreciate your comments that many of your patients are un-
able to communicate at all and, as you will recall, I stated that

I was well aware that many of your patients or their parents would
undoubtedly develop emotional problems if they were to communicate
with their parents or vice versa.

In my particulas~instance, however, my daughter had especially re-
quested that I visit her on Circus Day. Due to a combination of
circumstances, I was physically unable to come up to Polk and felt
that, for my daughter's welfare and general morale, it would be
beneficial if I were to communicate with her verbally explaining
just why I was unable to attend the activities planned for that.day.

While I must commend you on the remarkable progress you and your
associates and staff have made with Nancy over the past thirteen ”_
years,.I also feel that in cha ging times such as these, inflexible2'
rules, such as the communicati ns rule regarding telephones, may’W ‘
need to be reexamined and reevaluated. Most simp1y'stated, I feel
that many of your patients and their families would receive substan-
tial emotional and psychological benefits if freedom of communication
other than via correspondence were encouraged, within limits. I,

Acertainly do not intend to phone my daughter daily or even weekly,

or on any scheduled basis whatsoever but, merely, as the need
arises. As I explained to you, I am quite sure the telephone
company would be most cooperative in installing additional coin

_telephone facilities so your switchboard would not become over-

loaded.

I also want to thank you for making an exception to your-rule in
this particular instance. As a result of Nancy's telephone call
made to me within a half an hour of my conversation with you, I was
left with the distinct impression that Nancy understood why I could
not come up and she was able to communicate several of her needs to
me and, we were able to arrange a future weekend. Incidentally,
Mrs. Carey did indicate that Nancy needed a few items of clothing
and assured me that_she would see that these were provided for
Enclosed herewith is a check for $25.00 to cover these
minor needs.’ It is my plan to take her on a larger Fall shopping
expedition when I next visit her. '

Coincidentally, I received a survey form from the Office of Mental
Retardation and have copied my letter to you of this date to them
because I feel the rule regarding telephone comunications should V
be brought to their attention and be reevaluated. I feel quite '
sure there are patients where the rule i§_valid and applicable and
that there are other patients where it would be better for them to
be able to maintain a line of communication, other than via the
mail service, which is very, very slow, as you are well aware.
There are occasions when a familiar voice over the telephone is far
more reassuring than a written communication. V

Thanks once again for your understanding of the situation and, I
trust you will give serious consideration to revising the applica-

’tion of your rulé regarding phone communications, which I find to

';u. w.

be rather inflexible at the present time.
