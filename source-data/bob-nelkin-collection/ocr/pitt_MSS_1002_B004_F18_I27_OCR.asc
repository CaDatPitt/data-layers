Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuthz ' ' 5“ "_ﬁ

I wish to protest ygur recent dismissal of Dr; James Mcclelland,
Superintendent of Polk:State School and Hospital. Dr. Mcclelland

-has been greatlyamronged.by your recent action. The cnarges?

you made againstAwere completely unwarranted and unjustifiedd.
By'your recent action, you showed a complete lack of understand-
ing for the situation. Dr; Mcclelland has served the state

of Pennsylvania devotedly for the past tnirtyethree years.

He has proved himself a capable administrator and physician.
Your dismissal of him was not only cruel, inhumane, degrading
and indecent, but also shows a complete ignorance ON YOUR PART
in affairs pertaining to the care and treatment‘of the mentally
retarded. Your action in this matter will have a very detres
menial effect upon.the residents of Polk.whom you claim to
‘serve& By robbing them of this capable administfater, you

have stabbed them in the back! Their expressions of love
towards Dr; Mcclelland should make it clear to you howrvery,
very much they want him and need him. I beg you in the name-
of decency to rectify yourself in this matter by immediately
reinstating Dr; Mcclelland and PUELICLY APOLOGISING forvdeplor-
able actions in this matter. yoqg

Sincerglyiaours,
‘gem
