It has been brought to my attention that you have a policy and practice which
(1) prohibits residents of Folk State School and Hospital from making or
receiving outside telephone calls, and (2) incoming and outgoing mail is
opened and censored. These actions are explicitly prohibited by Section L23,
subsections (1) and (S) of the MH/MR Act of 1966. In addition, it is the
Regional policy to permit, and when appropriate, encourage residents to
establish meaningful outside contacts. While the Regional Office is aware
that some discretion must at times be applied, such discretion'should deal
with inappropriate use of the telephone rather than excluding the use for
everyone.

The Bill of Rights for the mentally retarded, currently being prepared by
the Allegheny Chapter, RARC, under the section "Personal Rights" states:

"Residents shall have the right to receive letters which will

be read uncensored to him if he is unable to read. The resident
shall have the right to direct communication, by phone and in
uncensored written correspondence, with his parents or guardian in
accordance with limitations set by them and agreed to by management."

The Regional Office supports this statement of Rights and expects the acceptance
in our institutions.

It is the Regional Office position that the following procedure be implemented:

1. Parents or guardians be informed that money is not to be mailed
directly to a resident unless the resident has demonstrated his
ability to handle money. Money should be mailed to the business
office where it is credited to the resident and a receipt
returned to the parent and resident..

2. Mail should be opened in front of the resident and read uncensored
to him if he is unable to read.

3. Outgoing mail will not be read and/or censored by any’staff member,
including the Superintendent.
