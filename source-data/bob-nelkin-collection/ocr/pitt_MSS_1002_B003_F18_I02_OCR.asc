DearVBob:

I have been trying to think for severa1 days of the best way
to phrase my response to your 1etter of January 6, 1975. Let me say
at the outset that I was a1so very concerned about the way Mrs. Webb
phrased her responses to questions put to her at the December 19, 1974
Liaison Committee meeting. I have, since that meeting,had severa1
conversations with Mrs. Webb and anticipate that there wi11 have to be
severa1 more before the current prob1ems in the Dietary Department are
reso ved.

Your 1etter focuses on who gave various instructions to Mrs.
Webb. In discussions with Mrs. Webb it has become apparent that more
important than specific1y "who" are the rather considerab1e communica-
tion prob1ems and confusion in 1ines of accountabi1ity and authority
that are revea1ed when the question of "who" is exp1ored. Let me say
that the "who" in most cases turns out to be Chi1d Care Aides who have
been very voca1 in their criticism of the Dietary Department. The
instructions, it appears, were not instructions, but rather comp1aints
to Mrs. Webb and other Dietary staff to which the Dietary Department
attempted to respond, at times inappropriate1y. The first of your
questions is a good examp1e of how some of these things come about.
It is "fo1k1ore" that fresh fruit and vegetab1es cause diarrhea. This
erroneous_be1ief is he1d by many Chi1d Care Aides who are quite
natura11y, on unstaffed tota1 care units, quite concerned with the
frequency of diaper changes. For this reason, many comp1aints have
been sent to Dietary about fresh fruits and vegetab1es. It is reported
that on a few occasions hard-pressed CCA's angry about 1ack of staff
have refused to feed fresh fruits and vegetab1es to tota1 care resi-
dents. It is because of these angry comp1aints that Mrs. Webb has been
hesitant to serve fresh fruits and vegetab1es frequent1y.

It has been made c1ear to Mrs. Webb that she is the dietetic
expert and that in such matters as types of foods to be served she
shou1d stand her ground. Further, efforts are being made through the
Nursing Department for more supervision of feeding to assure that
"fo1k1ore" wi11 not dictate what is served and not served and to provide

in-service training to CCA's on Dietary matters.

Your second question goes to the heart of another problem;
that is, the lack of clear definitions of what constitutes require-
ments for different types of food consistency diets. The french fries
incident appears to have been also prompted by a panic reaction on the
part of Dietary and other staff following the death of Paul Jenkins.
At that point, many people responded to the choking death as though
the way to prevent similar incidents was to be sure everything was
chopped as fine as possible. In order to correct previous laxities
and in order to avoid excesses born of panic or over concern the fol-
lowing steps have been taken: (1) the residence area physician and
nurse have reviewed all diet orders, and (2) tighter procedures for
regular reviews of diets are being written for the Dietary, Nursing
and Medical Departments. Another step must also be completed; that is,
a generally agreed upon set of definitions of what constitutes various
types of consistency diets. The types of foods that are acceptable
in each diet and the type of resident requiring each diet must be
agreed upon between the Dietary, Nursing, and Medical Department. To
accomplish this we have initiated a seriés¢of meetings with the Admin-
istrative Committee (the Superintendent and Assistant Superintendents)
and Mrs. Webb and Mrs. Porcaro.

The answer to your third and fourth questions, eg. the pul-
verizing of oranges and the reduction in the consistency of diets is
similar to the answer to the above question. In part, some of these
actions were the result of over reactions to the death of Paul Jenkins;
some diets may have been reduced as the result of the review of diets.

In short, it is apparent that Mrs. Webb has felt defensive
about the operations of the Dietary Department. In part, this defen-
siveness has resulted from factors over which Mrs. Webb had limited
control; for example, a much greater than normal turnover in personnel
in the Dietary Department in the past year, slow downs in replacement
of personnel because of a Regional Office freeze on non-direct care
personnel, and a large number of new staff unfamiliar with Dietary pro-
cedures (eg. only one of our present seven cooks has been in the job
for more than one year). Further, Mrs. Webb has both felt that she
has not had administrative backing to take stands on issues such as
the vegetables and has been reluctant to make use of administrative
channels that did exist. Finally, it is apparent that to far too
great an extent the Dietary Department has tended to operate in isola-
tion from treatment and habilitation services. There has been at best
insufficient communication between such departments as Nursing and the
leadership of the Dietary Department. Where such comunication has
taken place, it has been on a reactive rather than interactive basis.

In the few months since November, there has been a good deal
of discussion, review, and investigation of the Dietary Department
