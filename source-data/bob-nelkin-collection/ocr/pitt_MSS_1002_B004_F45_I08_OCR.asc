I. SeTTing: BeauTiful counTry seTTing -— all buildings are fieldsTone -- I000 acres,

SuperinTendenT aT The Hamburg and whiTe Haven STaTe Schools and
HospiTals.

* LaurelTon was founded abouT fifTy years ago as a facillTy for "defecTive,
de|inquenT women of child-bearing age" wiTh l.Q.'s over 70. This popula-
Tion peaked aT 997 residenTs. As a resulT of a fine dispersal plan, for
which Dr. Clark does noT Take crediT, LaurelTon is comforTably populaTed
now wiTh 430 reTarded men and women, only I8 of whom are "more psychoTic
Than reTarded" (Johnson CoTTage). ‘

* Family visiTaTion -- "any Time". (ParenTs’ reporTs do noT éonfirm This.)

* Board MeeTings - "open To The public". (CommuniTy reporTs do noT confirm
This.)

fied wiTh These numbers or wiTh The DirecTor of VolunTeers, To daTe.

sTudenT popu|aTion of 3,000, sends only l2 volunTeers To LaurelTon.

lll. ResidenTial CoTTages

. MosT of The residenTs in The building aT The Time of The visiT were in a

large mulTi-purpose room. IT would appear ThaT The LaurelTon residenTs are
noT given a chance To use This ToTal facilify To Their greaTesT advanTage.

The program in The mulTi-purpose room was co—ed.

How did anyThing as elaboraTe as This building geT builT in I969???
ApproximaTely 80 residenTs in The 5 To 2l age range.

Under The RighT To EducaTion, LaurelTon will geT Three Teacher aides in

4 consTanT care, non-abulaTory children from Myrna Owens

Dr. Clark wonders if The hospiTal building were Turned inTo a 4-bed consTanT
care uniT (similar To Myrna Owens), would The local hospiTals (such as
Geisinger) welcome The LaurelTon residenTs?

Vlll. OTher FacTs and Impressions:

IX. Follow-up

.STaTf numbers.

Ebensburg and similar bleak places should (among oTher Things) purchase
colorful plasTic play chairs for day rooms from, for insTance, Carroll's
(lnsTiTuTional FurniTure) in Chicago. WhaT should we do abouT Ebensburg?

There is no waiTing IisT aT LaurelTon. Dr. Clark said,
"Don'T send e any more children unless you send me more sTaff." How-
ever, iT is rumored ThaT LaurelTon will lose Twelve sTaff posiTions To
Selinsgrove -- parT of a plan To give Selinsgrove 200 new sTaff posiTions
and make all STaTe Schools and HospiTals "equally deprived". Should we

. objecT To This Transfer?

. There are numerous reporTs of horrendous condiTions aT Selinsgrove --

including bruTaliTy. Should we visiT wselinsgrove?
There are 25 fosTer grandparenTs in The FosTer GrandparenT Program.

AlThough many more are needed, iT is difficuIT geTTing inTeresTed in per-
sons wiThin The personal financial ceiling seT aT $2,000. Should we urge *~
ThaT The ceiling be raised To $3,000?

WhaT kind of pressure can we bring To geT The RighT To EducaTion imple-
menTed in STaTe Schools and HospiTals by The lnTermediaTe UniTs? Will
LaurelTon be allowed To use (for oTher purposes) The money previously
budgeTed To The educaTion of Those 2| and under and as of SepTember, I973,
assumed by The DeparTmenT of Educafion?
