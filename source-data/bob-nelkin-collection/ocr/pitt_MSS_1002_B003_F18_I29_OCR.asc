Threatened Work stoppage of Child Care and Dietary Workers
at Western State School & Hospital as a Result of the
State's Non-Payment of Salaries During Budget Dispute

The captioned strike was scheduled to begin at midnight‘
Thursday, July 12, and to continue for at least 24 hours.

The situation was discussed by the local President of the
union involved at Western State School and Hospital (American Fed-
eration of State, County and Municipal Employees), by WSSH's Sup-
erintendent, Robert Hiltner, and ACC staff. To insure that resi-
dents would not be completely without attendance during the specified
period, the union and Mr. Hiltner agreed to allow ACC-PARC to recruit
and organize volunteers to help to man the three shifts involved.

Mr. Hiltner believed there would be some regular staff on duty, but
could not guarantee how many. His high estimate was fifty per cent
(50%) of the child care workers.

At 12:30 Thursday, July 12, word was dispatched to all key
ACC staff members that an emergency meeting would be held at 1:00.
By 1:15, all summoned staff were present and the situation was dis-
cussed in depth. Staff present included Shirley Arch, Ron Archer,
Rich Hanechak, Ruth Kaplan, Dee Kriceri, Bob Nelkin, Mary Lou Mag-
istri, Dick Sell and Nancy Zirngibl.

Seven categories were drawn up from which appropriate vol-
unteers could be recruited. It was decided that a minimum of 25
volunteers for the night shift and 50 for each of the two day shifts
were absolutely essential. .

Ron Archer was assigned to arrange transportation and
seek an injunction via Neighborhood Legal Services. After dis-
cussion, it was agreed that a "writ of mandamus" would have to
be directed against the Governor and the Secretary of Welfare
for failing to halt the walkout.

Bob Nelkin was assigned communication liaison between
WSSH administration, strikers, and the WSSH Parents’ Group.

Loretta Bailie and Shirley Arch contacted their staff
subordinates seeking volunteers for the midnight shift. _It was
agreed that the Opportunity Centers would not be closed because
of a need for volunteers. Approximately 25 volunteers were sel-
ected from the Opportunity Centers Division. All one hundred
Foster Grandparents volunteered.

Dick Sell solicited volunteers from our pre-school and
the City/County school systems. Ruth Kaplan contacted Base Service
Unit volunteers. Mary Lou Magistri also was in touch with the
leadership of the Junior Women's Club and had 12 volunteers by‘
2:30. These were R.N.'s and teachers. Nancy Zirngibl was in
touch with all media alerting them to a possible fast-breaking
news story. The Executive Director cleared the use of Base Service
Units and ACC staff as "volunteers" with the MH/MR Program.

Secretaries agreed to man the phones all night to sign up
volunteers. Executive Director contacted regional vice-president
of PARC to alert eight chapters in the Southwest Region. Dee Kri-
ceri polled the ACC Executive Committee.

ACC's school bus and two station wagons, and two chartered
buses were agreed upon as adequate transportation; and a schedule
of departure times from the State Office Building was established.

The meeting ended at 2:00 and all staff immediately began
specifically to implement their segment of the over—a1lplan of ac-
tion. -

Fortunately, the strike was averted. We received official
notification of this fact at 3:30. Staff then retraced their steps,
informing, thanking, and cancelling scheduled and possible volunteers,
members of the news media, the bus company, etc., etc.

Between the time that the planning meeting ended and the time
the cancellation of the strike was made known to our office (18 hours)
a total of 45 volunteers had been confirmed. This figure includes.

31 staff members. It was evident that we would have been able to
assure at least the minimum of 125 volunteers needed before the first
shift began.

There are two reasons for this memo being sent to you.
.One is to keep you fully informed. The second reason is perhaps
the more important in this particular instance. It is to share
with you an almost unbelievable example of volunteer and staff
support during a time of crisis.

The wholehearted cooperation of the staff was no surprise.
I am extremely proud of their resourcefulness and dedication.
