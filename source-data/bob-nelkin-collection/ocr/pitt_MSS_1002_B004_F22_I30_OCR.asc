The Honorable Milton Shapp
Governor of Pennsylvania
State Capitol _
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Governor Shapp:

The news releases as to the firing of Dr. James ucclelland,
Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital, are observed
and unacceptable to the citizens who know him. '

Dr. Mcclelland is a fine, dedicated, community leader.
While, no doubt he was following rules and regulations set by
superiors in Harrisburg, the use of the terms, "inhumane, cruel,
and degrading”, as stated by Mrs. Helen Wohlgemuth, Secretary of
the Department of Public welfare, as reasons for his dismissal
are not deserving of Dr. McCle1land's character.

Personally, and in behalf of the many citizens who have
called my office, and the Chamber of Comerce, we believe a re-
traction of the terms stated for his dismissal )5 in order.

We who visit Polk State School more often than the Secre-
tary's two hour visit have the deepest respect for the adminis-
tration and for the school. -

Sincerely,
/" -' ' _! ,
