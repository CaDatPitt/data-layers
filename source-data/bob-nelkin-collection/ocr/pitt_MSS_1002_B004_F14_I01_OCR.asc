SECRETARY

James H. Mcclelland, M.D. .. -‘
Polk State_School and Hospital
Polk, Pennsylvania 16342.

Dear Doctor Mcclelland:

, I regret to inform you that you are hereby removed from
your position as Superintendent, facility for the mentally disabled,
Polk State School and Hospital, effective at the close of business,
May 1, 1973. ' '- '

Effective immediately, Dr. Wesley D. White, Superintendent
of White Haven State-School and Hospital, will assume, in an acting
capacity, complete administrative responsibility for the operation of”
Polk State School and Hospital.- * ‘

The reasons for your removal are:

l. The cruel, degrading, and inhumane conditions
which I personally observed during my visit on
April 14, 1973. This refers specifically to
the locked "cages" and pens in which you
authorized the confinement of patients.

2- Severe and chronic deficiencies with respect to
the proper training and orientation of professional -
and-non-professional staff in the appropriate care
and treatment of mentally retarded residents.

It is expected that every effort will be made to ensure an
orderly period of transition for the welfare of residents and staff.

This action is being taken under Section 807 of the Civil-
Service Act. If you should desire to appeal, your letter to the Civil
Service Commission requesting an appeal should set forth reasons to
support the appeal. A copy of this letter should be supplied to this
office. Such reasons will, of course, have to be substantiated by
evidence and testimony upon hearing.
