Dear Norm, , . ’ . ~ , ggg  ;§J

As a result of a recent inspection at Polk it was revealed “I
that the ll0 electric beds which were to have been sent to Polk from .' : iv’
Marcy have not yet arrived. Nor does anybody from Polk seem to know i
when (or if) they will arrive. '

On three separate occasions, PARC has been told that the
electric beds at Marcy were being sent to Polk. » ~

As we are all well aware, these beds are desperately needed
by Polk residents. The conditions of many of the beds and mattresses
on which Polk residents sleep ranges from pathetic to outrageous. If
this situation can be remedied for ll0 residents, this would be, at the
very least, an act of kindness. To deprive people of this necessity,
on the other hand, is needless cruelty.

I earnestly hope that the transfer of these beds from Marcy
to Polk is not bogged down in some morass of paperwork somewhere or that
these beds have ended up in another facility!

would you please look into this situation personally, and
let me know as soon as possible what is happening?

Sincerely,

’)7ZOJ'.j,.-/rz,<..
