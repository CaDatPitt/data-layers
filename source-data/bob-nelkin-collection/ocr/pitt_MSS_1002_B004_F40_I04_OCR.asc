Dear Joe.

I would appreciate answers to the following
questions regarding admissions to Polk:

1) How many admissions to Polk in the last
12 months?

2) How any of those admissions to Polk
were by court order?

3) What is the criteria for admission to
Pblk?

4) Are you satisfied with comunity programs
developing alternatives around for
individuals who have requested adiissions?

We had great success in stopping all admissions
to western state school and Hospital. I hope it
is similar success (without our involvement) at
Polk.

sincerely.
