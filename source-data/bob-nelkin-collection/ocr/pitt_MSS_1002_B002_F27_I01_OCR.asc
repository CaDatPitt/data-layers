". . . My impression was that the records were

generally deficient. That is important because
the records really are a guideline to where the
individual is and what the individuals need and
if that's not assessed correctly and spelled out
and planned clearly, then there is no way to
provide those things for the residents."
(Clements, N.T. 2-22) '

"I did examine a number of records at random. .
the records were inadequate and incomplete."
(Clements, N.T. 2-78)

"We found gaps, sometimes several months;
in decedents' charts these gaps were often just
prior to the terminal event." (p. 2)

"Progress notes were fragmented and multi-
disciplinary, creating hazardous situations." (p.2)

"In many instances in records of deceased residents,
it became obvious that signs of problems were
present long enough before the terminal event to
prevent death or mitigate threat of serious

accident or disease." (pp.2-3)

". . .documentation of the process of medical
diagnosis and treatment is scandalously poor." (p.4)

"The effects of poor documentation of the medical
diagnosis/treatment paradigm are extensive."(p.6)

Records of formal annual exams are "sketchy and
superficial." Generally conclude with a single
diagnosis of "mental retardation" even where
powerful drugs such as Tagamet and Dyazide, which
have no known use in treating mental retardation

_per sg are being used.(p. 6)

Seizures recorded individually on small forms,

taped into the record, often mixed with lab
reports, etc. . . . no running summary of
seizures written down in a single place --
"inconvenient, dangerous." (p. 10)

Many nurses‘ notes substitute for physician --

Physician progress notes "extremely difficult to
follow" —- kept in different places, using

different forms." (p, 10)

"If I can speak generally . . . the living
situation at Pennhurst is one of large day

rooms, large sleeping areas, where large

numbers of people congregate and live together.
In most cases there is no pretense of privacy,
the noise level is extraordinarily high, the
level of supervision is low." (Clements N.T.2-36)

"There were a number of errors (improper
feeding techniques) at Pennhurst in which
individuals there are essentially confined to
bed unless they are taken out."

(Clements, N.T. 2-62)

"Q. 'Are there also hazards (aspiration, asphyx-

fitted wheelchairs?’

A. ‘Yes. . . the same hazards would exist. .

Overuse and

in many institutions, including Pennhurst."

"Q. '. . . I take it that your general

impression . . . is that the ratios at Pennhurst

indicate an overuse of drugs?'

suspect that that is the case.'"(Clements,

". . .On the basis of the 51 per cent of the
residents receiving it (tranquilizing drugs); on
the basis of the residents who are receiving
psychotropic medication, 40 per cent

receiving polypharmacy; on the basis of the length
of time they are getting it; and on the basis

of the very inadequate monitoring of the effects,
they are being used excessively.’

"Q.'Would you characterize such usage as consti-
tuting chemical restraints?’

A. 'Yes. I believe that's the characterization.‘
(Sprague, N.T. 3-44)

"In my survey of the roughly 303 times medication
was ordered, even counting trite phrases, such as
"Behavior that I have referred to above," evalu-
ation was only attempted 29 per cent of the
time."

A. ‘I would say most significant deficiency.’ "
(Sprague, N.T. 3-45)

"Q. 'What would you consider essential to con-
stitute adequate and continued monitoring behavioral
effects?’

A. '. . . an adequate diagnosis and specification
for why the medications are being given and what

is expected. . . an evaluation of how the resident
is responding now compared with prior to the onset_
of the medication, and the specification of . . .
why the medication is being given. . . Then, after
the start of the medication, routine —- probably

effects of the medication.‘ " (Sprague, N.T.3—46)

A. 'No, they are not. Particularly we referred

to Exhibit 43 which was the Joint Commission
Standards, where it specifically stated that drugs
should not be used in a manner to interfere with
the patients or resident's habilitative program.

I think that professional standard is not followed

at Pennhurst.’

A. ‘Yes, they are.‘ " (Sprague, N.T. 3-54,55)
