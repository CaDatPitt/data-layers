Dr. James R. McClelland
Polk State School and Hospital
Polk, Pennsylvania

Thank you very much for your response to my request re-
garding telephone communications with my daughter, Nancy,
Dr.'McClelland.

I fear, however, that the single solution presented for

me and Nancy does not provide an adequate solution for the
more basic problem of the abridgement of freedom of commu-
nications, and in fact, civil liberties for all of your
patients at Polk. Making a single exception, in my case,
only points up the fact that there are thousands of patients
and parents who have no access to free communications with
each other.

Mike Levine, Host of the Open Mike Show, became very inter-
ested in the problem when I related my difficulties last
Circus Day. In a conversation with him several nights ago,
it developed that practices similar to those practiced at
Polk, and even worse - "where phone communications and

use of the telephone are used as a training (disciplinary?)
procedures" are widespread at state institutions across
Penn9Ylvania.u““""‘*"*A* ’ '*i‘” ’ ' 4’«

Mike, as you know, is interested in the plight of all un-
fortunate people, regardless of whether they are mentally
retarded, physically disabled, or in fact, in anyone whose
basic freedoms are being infringed. As a result of the
investigation he and his staff made, the whole matter has
been reviewed with Governor Shapp who has promised he will
designate a staff representative to investigate conditions
at all state institutions relating to this communications
problem; "’ ““ °* ‘I ‘”V" " '* ' ‘ ‘ v “‘
