irrerror at Polk -

Editor. The Herald
As parents of a resident of Polk State
School and Hospital, we wish to
express our concern and complete
disapproval in the dismissal of Dr.
J.H. McClelland as superintendent and
of the critical statements made by
other parties. ' ' V

‘ When statements such as those in?

Wednesday‘s Herald edition
concerning patients reach the public‘s
‘eye. the community in general tend to
laud the action taken. When a person
like myself reads the same statements,
I feel there is injustice being done.
Polk State School and Hospital ranks
as one of the most proficient and well
kept schools in our state under the
leadership of Dr. McClelland. I have
had the opportunity to visit various
institutions both in Ohio and
Pennsylvania and can truthfully boast
the Polk State School is well ahead in
towards the retarded
child.

We are refuting Mrs. Wohlgemuth's
statement that Dr. McClelland

‘permitted. (1) cruel. degrading and

inhumane conditions and. (2) severe

‘ and chronic deficiencies with respect

Wohlgemuth? When asked how she 7
would have handled the situation. she '

said. “I have never operated an
'Insti_tution." What kind of answer is
this from a state welfare
representative? She keeps expounding

.« on the overcrowded and understaffed _

conditions at the institution. so why not

~ work on something that is constructive 

insteadof dismissing Dr. McClelland?

We‘ feel this is a political move. and it's V

a shame that the retarded person will

be affected by such. with the dismissal P

of Dr. McClelland.

The public must be made aware of
the fact that there are people in our
world who are less fortunate than us

and must be cared for all their lives. _‘ U

Polk State School exercises the very
best methods in caring for these

people. There is an underlying factor ~‘

that has triggered this dismissal and

the public should be given the total _

facts before any decision is made.
Mrs. Wohlgemuth. through her

actions. displayed a complete lack of

knowledge in the proper health.
education and welfare of the 2.831
residents at Polk State School and
Hospital. Also. we believe a public
apology should be made by Mrs.
Wohlgemuth to Dr. McClelland.
