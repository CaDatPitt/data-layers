Secretary of Public Welfare Helene Wohlgemuth announced a series of actions
designed to improve the quality of care and rehabilitation at Polk State School and
Hospital. Mrs. Wohlgemuth in a letter to the parents of children at the institution
said: "In the midst of all the controversy, my primary concern continues to be the
well-being of your child at Polk."

In moves which will translate that concern into action, the Secretary announced
several steps she has taken. First, a group of seven nationally known experts in
modern programing for the mentally retarded are visiting Polk today. The experts
are viewing programs at the facility and/grovide observations and an evaluation based
on their own experiences.

Mrs. Wohlgemuth said: "I am pleased we could call on the advice of people such
as Alan Menefee, Director of the President's Committee on Mental Retardation,

Phillip Roos, Executive Director of the National Association for Retarded Children and
others to provide help in improving programs at Polk."

The seven member team in addition to Roos and Menefee includes:

Dr. Marvin Kivitz
Elwyn Institute

Mr. Albert Meuli
National Association of Superintendents of Public Residences Facilities
for the Mentally Retarded

Mr. Gene Patterson
National Association for Retarded Children, Residential Committee
