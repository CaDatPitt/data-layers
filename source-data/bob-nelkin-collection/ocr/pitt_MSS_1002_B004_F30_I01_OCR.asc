SUBJECT: Recent Death at Polk State School and Hospital

DATE: May 6 , 1975

Enclosed please find information gathered from Polk State School
and Hospital regarding the Carl Fisher death. The information enclosed
and the information obtained from my personal investigation indicate
cause of death was accidental.

I still have questions regarding two issues:

l) The definition of a "undetermined" cause of death. “Some how
it is hard for me to digest this ruling.

2) Joe Columbatto mentioned that the State Police conducted a
thorough investigation;-when I inquired about Carl's death from the
staff at Eillcrest Cottage, they stated no one from the State Police
Department came to question them about the incident.
