Dear Bob:

I am responding to your letter whereby you have received word that the position
freeze is seriously affecting the'care of residents at Polk.

We are in the same position as all facilities, in that there is a hiring freeze
on.

Although we use the term "freeze", it is a misnomer in that we are able to fill

most positions after a lengthy process of the facility justifying the need for the

job and, then, a series of approvals must be sought through the Department, ultimately
ending at the Budget Secretary. The process usually takes about six weeks. Obviously,
this delay is very detrimental to a smooth-running operation and creates a heavy
overtime situation.

Each of our resident buildings has a minimum staffing requirement below which
we very seldom go. When there are unfilled vacancies on a shift, it is impossible
to meet this minimum without using overtime. In many cases this overtime is
accomplished by the use of the mandatory process. That is, when a shift coming on
duty is without the required number and no other buildings can provide additional
manpower, then, a number of staff from the shift going off duty must stay over into
the next shift. The problem that this causes is that the person staying on for a
second, 8-hour shift is certainly not at his best. He may have had plans after work
and since he cannot go home, his attitude is extremely poor. This is not an exception
but almost a daily occurrence. So, in the final analysis, even though we are keeping
the staff at a minimum level, the quality of their efforts is greatly diminished.

We understand the necessity of the "freeze" because of budget problems, but we
are consistently confronted with a serious morale problem in the ranks.

It would be very advantageous for the freeze to be lifted on all direct-care
positions. That would be a major improvement.

If you have any further questions, please give me a call.

Sincerely yours,
