COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE
HARRISBURG

FRANK S. BEAL
SECRETARY

To the People of Pennsylvania:

With this issue of The Challenge, the De artrnent is initiating a yearly report
to the people concerning the main thrusts 0 Department programs and the high-
lights of the year’s activities.

This is not an inclusive report of all of the activities of the Department, but a
survey designed to enable our readers to gain an overview of the Department’s
major efforts during ﬁscal 1974-75. Those readers who would like more detailed
information about speciﬁc programs should write to the Bureau of Public Educa-
tion for additional material.

Durin the ﬁscal year, we continued to strive toward the twofold goal of mak-
ing our uman service programs both administratively accountable and respon-
sive and relevant to the needs of the people of the Commonwealth.

Programs and services for the mentally ill, the mentally retarded, the elderly,
the young, and for people living in poverty are desi ned to “help people help
themselves.” Human service programs make it possib e for people to cope with
crisis situations caused by ﬁnancial problems, illness, family crises, the disabili-
ties which often accompany aging—all of the stressful situations that individuals
or families may confront during their lives.

The in ' thrust in d velo in ro rams in all areas is to rovide services in
the communi which enable eo le receive hel where and when it "S"fT6Ed'1 ed

ing it possi e or fami ies to remain in ac and for persons with disabilities to

remain art of the communit .
For those persons who require more intensive care through institutional pro-

grams, the emphasis is placed on individual needs assessment and treatment pro-
grams designed to meet those needs.

In all programs, there is an increasing involvement of the community in the
determination of what services are needed and in setting priorities. The involve-
ment of citizens at the local level increases the awareness that human services
are an indispensable part of each neighborhood, designed to sustain each family's
functioning and to improve the quality of life in the community.

An essential element in the provision of human services must be an em hasis
on the worth and dignity of the individual being served and the Pennsy vania
Department of Public Welfare’s efforts continue to be geared both to achieving
accountability and to delivering services with a concern and a respect for the
integrity of all of our clients.

_ Very truly yours,

Secretary

Health
Care

One measure of a society's con-
cern for people is the quality of
health care made available to them
—not only to those who have the
ﬁnancial resources to pay for good
care, but to all citizens.

The Department’s primary goals
in the Medical Assistance Program
are:

—to establish a health delivery
system which ‘provides adequate
health care in an environment in
which needy people are treated
with respect and dignity; and

—to develop an eflicient and ac-
countable delivery system to insure
that funds expended provide the
greatest possible services at the
least possible cost.

Persons eligible for cash assist-
ance and SSI are eligible for Medi-
cal Assistance beneﬁts. Other needy
families may also be eligible de-
pending on their income and ex-
penses.

Adequate health care is essential
to enable children and adults to live

decently, to avoid the debilitating
effects of untreated illness, and to
become independent members of
our communities.

During the ﬁscal year, a monthly
average of more than 366,000 per-
sons received a medical service—an
increase of almost 20 percent over
1973-74. The total cost of the Medi-
cal Assistance program was $671.8
million, compared to $568.9 million
in 1973-74—approximately half of
these costs are reimbursed by the
Federal government.

Beneﬁts include inpatient hos-
pital care, skilled and intermediate
nursing care, post-hospital care,
transportation services, clinic ser-
vices, laboratory and x-ray services,
medical appliances, psychiatric and
drug and alcohol clinic services,
and the services of physicians, den-
tists, pharmacists, chiropractors, po-
diatrists and visiting nurses.

A priority of the Department has
been to reduce the cost of medical
care through the elimination of un-
necessary days spent in a hospital
and through the expansion of out-
patient services to avoid the need
for hospitalization.

Inpatient hospital care is the larg-
est single cost of the medical assist-
ance program. To reduce unneces-

3

sary hospitalization, the Depart-
ment initiated the Pre-Discharge
Utilization Review (PDUR) pro-
gram in 1973 on a pilotbasis in Al-
legheny County. The program is
designed to prevent overutilization
of inpatient services through the
careful examination of the need for
admission, the provision of guide-
lines for duration of hospital stay,
and the establishment of review
committees to monitor compliance
with recommended standards.

Based on the success of this pro-
gram, it was expanded into South-
eastern Pennsylvania in Ianuary
1974, and statewide in October
1974.

The average length of stay de-
clined from 9.3 days in 1971-72 to
8.2 days in 1974-75, resulting in a
savings of more than $33 million.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE
YEAR

0 Full operation of the early
childhood health screening program
designed to detect -and treat health
deﬁciencies before they cause seri-
ous impairment to growth and de-
velopment. This is discussed in
more detail under Services to Chil-
dren.

1975, which enables persons depen-
dent on medical assistance to ob-
tain prescription drugs in a manner
similar to services extended under
private health insurance plans.

The program also provides, for
the ﬁrst time, data which makes it
possible to monitor drug usage to
safeguard the health and well-be-
ing of users and to identify cases of
misutilization and abuse by recip-
ients and providers.

0 Two Health Maintenance Or-
ganizations (HMO) serving ap-
proximately 12,000 medical assist-
ance recipients were functioning at
the end of the ﬁscal year for the
purpose of providing competitive
alternative health delivery systems
in the major urban centers of Penn-
sylvania. Contracts with ﬁve more
HMO’s are anticipated during the
1975-1976 ﬁscal year.

Guaranteed availability of ser-
vices, as well as more eﬁicient pro-
cessing of invoices and cost control
are by-products of the HMO. These
alternative health delivery systems
will provide health services to all
citizens and will ensure that the
prepaid/HMO option is available
to a large portion of those citizens
eligible for Medical Assistance in
1975-76.

0 Nursing Home relocation
teams continued to transfer Medi-
cal Assistance patients from private
nursing homes, deemed hazardous
because of failure to meet Life
Safety Code requirements.

As a result of the passage of a
referendum in May 1974, a Nursing
Home Loan Agency was created to
provide low cost loans to assist
facilities to make the corrections
needed to meet ﬁre and safety stan-
dards of the Life Safety Code.

0 Other medical assistance ser-
vice improvements included a $3
fee increase from $6 to $9 to select
hospital outpatient clinics and
emergency rooms. Fees for cardiac
catherizations were also increased
and the $5 monthly co-payment re-
quirement for medically needed re-
cipients was removed. Eyeglasses
and hearing aids are available to
screened individuals.

Opportunity
for

Retarded
Citizens

During the last decade, a new
era of opportunity has emerged for
mentally retarded citizens. The con-
cept is based on the principle of
“normalization” which means that
retarded citizens have the right to
learn, to work, to earn, to play, to
love, to vote, even to take risks—in
other words, to live as normally as
possible.

For the more than 360,000 re-
tarded citizens in Pennsylvania the
Department’s major goal during the
ﬁscal year was to strengthen and
expand supportive services in the
community to enable every men-
tally retarded person to live as in-
dependently as he or she is able
and to avoid institutionalization.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE
YEAR

Community Living
Arrangements

Pennsylvania’s Community Liv-
ing Arrangements Program, the
largest such program in the nation,
provides group homes and other
residential arrangements for men-
tally retarded people. Since its in-
ception in 1972, more than 2,500 in-
dividuals have been served by the
program — approximately half of

them were residents of State insti-

tutions who are now functioning as
independent and semi-independent
members of communities.

During the ﬁscal year, 1,920 per-
sons were served under the pro-
gram. As of June 30, 1975, 1,605
persons were in the prognam, of

which 786 were former residents of
State institutions, 78 from private
facilities, 741 from the community,
and the remainder from other types
of living arrangements.

Twenty-ﬁve group homes were
established during the year, and
over 200 other types of residential
arrangements were added to the
program.

In addition to providing a home
in the community, the CLA pro-
gram provides supportive services
such as training in daily living ac-
tivities, recreation, and assistance
in being integrated into all aspects
of community life.

Each type of residential setting
serves as a base from which indi-
viduals may go forth into the com-
munity -— to school, to church, to
sports events, to recreational activi-
ties, to shop and to work.

Despite the success of the pro-
gram, the beneﬁts to both mentally
retarded citizens and the communi-
ties in which they live, many com-
munities have been reluctant to
permit group homes because of
groundless fears and ignorance
about mental retardation. There is
a continuing need for public infor-
mation and education programs to
help people understand what men-
tal retardation is and to focus atten-
tion on the capabilities and talents
of mentally retarded people.

By living and working in the
community, mentally retarded peo-
ple become useful, productive citi-
zens. They contribute toward their
own support, reducing state and lo-
cal governmental spending. They
become taxpayers instead of being

v‘,

\

tax-supported. But, most impor-
tantly, they are ena e e as
n rma as si e wi i nity
and in epen ence, sel -estee_n‘1__ and
self-suﬂiciéncy.

Family Resource Services

More than 95 percent of all men-
tally retarded persons live in their
own homes or in community set-
tings. To provide help for families
with a retarded member living at
home, the Department initiated the
Family Resource Services program
in 1973. Under the program, fam-
ilies can obtain temporary care for
a retarded member during illness,
family crises, or when the family
takes a much-needed vacation.
Family aid supplies a person to
care for a retarded family member
for a few hours at a time so that
the family can keep medical ap-
pointments, shop, and participate in
normal community activities.

Other services include recreation,
homemaker services, transportation,
in-home therapy and parent train-
mg.

During the ﬁscal year, more than
31,700 families received help
through the program.

Early Intervention

By providing care and treatment
for a retarded child at the earliest
possible time, mental retardation
can be minimized. Twenty-four
early intervention projects located
in 19 urban and rural counties of
Pennsylvania provided individually
developed training programs to 500
children from birth to school entry
age during the year. These projects
are designed to maximize the
child's present skills and develop-
ment potential and to increase the
family’s ability to assist with
growth-facilitating experiences.
Cognitive, motor, sensory, self-care,
language and personal-social skills
for the child and family training
methods and techniques are devel-
oped.

Vocational Services

An essential ingredient for
achieving independent living is em-
ployment. Through vocational ser-
vices, mentally retarded people re-
ceive job training and are assisted

in ﬁnding employment in business
and industry or in sheltered work-
shops in the community.

Vocational services include eval-
uation to identify interests and
skills, personal and work adjust-
ment training, vocational training,
job placement and sheltered em-
ployment.

During the year, more than 6,000
mentally retarded persons partici-
pated in the program.

Institutional Programs

Although the vast majority of
mentally retarded people do not
need the intensive care offered
through institutions, for those who
do require that level of care, the
Department emphasized the devel-
opment of individual assessment of
needs and personalized treatment
programs during the year.

Through funding under Act 75A,
effective December 13, 1974, a
Medical Assessment Project for
state schools was conducted. This
survey established guidelines for

the evaluation of each resident’s
ability to care for his or her own
personal needs and to function in
an independent manner. Not only
medical information, but tools such
as genetic counseling, occupational
and physical therapy, and speech
and hearing examinations were
used to determine individual needs
and appropriate treatment to meet
those needs.

As the result of the Department's
efforts to provide the opportunity
for residents of state schools to en-
ter community living arrangements
and increases in staff, the resident-
staff ratio during the year was
maintained at one-to-one, on the
basis of all staff members.

A better resident/ staff ratio in-
sures the capability to provide the
quality care and treatment neces-
sary to help each resident reach his
potential level of growth and de-
velopment.

As part of this project, a staffing
and management review of all state
schools was begun to assure the
maximum utilization of personnel.

Polk Dispersal Project

To deal with the overcrowded
situation at Polk State School the
Department initiated the Polk Dis-
persal Program-a concentrated ef-
fort to provide better care for resi-
dents in need of institutional pro-
grams and to enable those residents

— not in need of institutional care to

live in independent or semi-inde-
pendent community settings.

Through extensive work with
families and community agencies,
25 percent of the residents of Polk,
who were capable of living in the
community, were provided with
semi-independent and intermediate
care living arrangements. This de-
crease in the population enabled
the staff to provide a higher qual-
ity program for residents remain-
ing at the School.

During the year, Robinson De-
velopment Center in McKees Rocks
and Highland Park Center in Pitts-
burgh were established to provide
skilled nursing care residences de-
livering intensified care and treat-
ment for 264 profoundly retarded
adults. ’

The Allegheny Valley Senior
School in Robinson Township pro-
vided 32 beds for persons who were
exceptionally capable and who
could be expected to move into less
supervised situations in the near fu-
ture.

Emphasis was placed on resi-
dents who were also capable of
moving into their own homes, and
parents were encouraged and of-
fered supportive services to enable
them to care for family members
at home.

The C. Howard Marcy Hospital
in Pittsburgh was opened in ]anu-
ary for 152 former residents of

12

  

Polk who were ready to begin re-
habilitation and vocational training.

Other residents were located in
foster homes, group homes, inde-
pendent living situations, or in their
own homes.

Through this intensive program,
the population of Polk was reduced
from more than 2,500 to 1,900. The
institution is still operating beyond
its true capacity, and efforts under
the dispersal project will continue
during the 1975-76 ﬁscal year.

The beneﬁts are twofold. Those
residents who are capable of living
in the community are receiving the
supportive services necessary for
them to make the adjustment suc-
cessfully. A new life is opening for
them.

Those residents who remain at
Polk are beneﬁting from a higher
staff to resident ratio which has
made it possible to provide better
treatment programs, recreation, ex-
panded opportunity for excursions
and trips, and an environment
which is service oriented.

Cresson State Schools
Foster Family Services

A special pilot project was initi-
ated during the year at Cresson
State School in west-central Penn-
sylvania. Through the Specialized
Foster Family Services project, 12
retarded children between the ages
of six and 17 were placed in foster
homes where they have the advan-
tage of a home environment, with
loving and caring parents.

All of the children involved suffer
severe retardation with physical
handicaps. Foster parents are reim-
bursed based on the severity of
the child’s handicap and receive on-
going training and support from a
team of specialists to help them
provide quality care for their foster
children. This pioneer program,
funded through State and Federal
monies, will be used as a national
model for this type of deinstitution-
alization.

Lebanon County Life
Support Unit

A ﬁrst-of-its-kind facility to care
for profoundly and severely re-
tarded people was developed in

_ ugh the Com-
munity Living Arrangements Pro-
gram. The facility is designed to
enable Lebanon County residents,
previously in State Schools through-
out the Commonwealth, to be
brought home to be cared for where
parents and family members can be
close enough to visit and assist in
treatment programs.

Pennsylvania Fellowship Plan

During the year, the responsibil-
ity for the Fellowship Plan was as-
sumed by the Pennsylvania Asso-
ciation of Retarded Citizens
(PARC). Initiated in 1973, the proj-
ect provides volunteers to serve on
a one-to-one basis as big brothers
or sisters to mentally retarded citi-
zens, assisting them with learning
the daily living skills needed to live
in the community.

Second Annual Art Show

A concrete example of the ability
-and talent mentally retarded indi-
viduals demonstrate, if given the
opportunity, is vividly shown dur-
ing the Department’s annual art
shows.

The Second Annual Show was
exhibited in the William Penn Me-
morial Museum, Harrisburg, from
April 11 through May 12. All of the
art on display won the honor to be
shown at the juried art show by
virtue of having won in local com-
munity, "county and regional com-
petition before advancing to the
ﬁnal statewide contest.

Exhibitors, many of whom are
physically disabled as well as men-
tally retarded, represent a wide
range in age, and their works in-
clude a variety of media ranging
from simple crayon and ﬁnger paint
sketches to complicated ink and
watercolor drawings.

Best of the Show Award in the
1975 contest was won by Cleance
Lewis, a 17-year-old mentally re-
tarded girl from Woods School, a
private facility in Bucks County.

The creativity and talent demon-
strated by all of the entries, some
despite severe physical handicaps,
serves as an outstanding example of
the contribution that can be made
by mentally retarded citizens.
