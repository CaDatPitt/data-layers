WESTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL
LIAISON COMMITTEE

December 194 1974

Meeting was called by Western State School and Hospital
parents - criticalf quality, quantity, and effectiveness
of food service.

Gen. Mcbain represented the Parent's Group. Specifically
charged "no one is responsible for food service at place

it is delivered to residents". "Food is ineditable." "Menu
is catch as catch can." "No real planned snack in the
evening."

Mrs. McLain - not enough employees - only one supervisor to
go around to meals to check on quality.

Mrs. McLain - "morning person (dietary) orders food is unaware
of capability of residents to eat."

Torisky - cottage (Beech) residents have fresh greens only
twice a week at the most.

McKenna - has prepared a memo - to the WSSH administration:
food is tasteless, unappetizing, would not feed my child, or
would not eat myself. Great discrepancy between doctors in
institution on mechanical diet and finger food. one attendant
said to me today - "within six months, the residents will not
be able to chew.

Everything is ground. Everything is dog meat. The food served
on Pine (hyperactive individuals), attendants complained not
enough food. Children acting like wild animals rummaging
through garbage for food.

Out of food - Pine III had not eaten yet. Only once‘per person

(hyperactive fullmgrown males). Went through serving line -
little food value. Lettuce major portion of the meal, out of
vegetables.

I was informed by Pine III - total weight loss from ll/18 to
12/18, 6-11 pounds per person. I went to records to validate
alleged weight loss. Doctor submitted order asking for addi-
tional nourishment on this unit because of weight loss. The
food is exotic - coconut juices (doubt the residents have a
taste for this). Joe McKenna willing to give name of nurse
who would complain. On Monday they had'burger hits? as appe-
tizing as eating linoleum off the floor. Macroni cold, sticky,
stale, and not even butter on it. I would not eat it or feed
it to my child. Today they had ham with barbecue and macroni
with butter, it was decent.

Teachers are upset about food for residents. In the staff,
dietary serving sandwiches because there is a lack of food.
What is the planning that has brought this shortage about?

A bite size tray, in my opinion, is what is put on a fork,
not what is put on a spoon. You cannot teach a child to have
table manners, to eat with the family out in a restaurant,
home, or amusement park if we are grinding up their food here.
This is their training. If we don't have utensils, how can
we train people to eat with utensils. We were not provided
with utensils, only plastic forks. I don't want to serve
baby food to a 18 year old who tomorrow can go out and get a
job. A doctor should know what the various trays are, that
he/she are ordering. Too many times we blame, local institu-
tions. How much money for food is being allocated for food
per year? Are we getting nourishing diets or an appetizing
diet? I want food that the residents like. I want nourish-
ment that isn't just calories. I want snacks that they like.

McKenna - still -
Torisky — what's the solution?

McKenna - give them as much food as they need regardless of

Torisky - who is responsible?

McKenna - I will give Hiltner and Scott the names of people
who will testify.

Mrs. Webb responded to Mr. Hiltner's question: Is the problem
insufficient budget for food? Have you ever been turned down?
"No . N

Send purchase orders to purchasing agent. our shortages are
foods bid on a state-wide level (fruits, vegetables, potatoes,
spaghetti, dehydrated food). Our procurement office orders
through the Department of Properties and Supplies. I have

never been aware that several orders of green beans would be
substituted and served when there are no potatoes.

Dr. Scott said dietary knew two days in advance they are getting
out of potatoes - low on potatoes - called to dietary office -
no substitute was sent over so double orders of green beans

have a lack of staff.

Mrs. Webb - food is being thrown away right now. There is not
a shortage on Pine right now.

Levinson - can foods are being cancelled. Producers can't meet
the orders. A purchase requisition to the state delays food
to 90 days from ordercitﬁé.

Mrs. Webb - prepares menu based on what is'expected in’when menu
comes up. On the fruits and vegetables - I would like to serve
every day. I am not serving them because individuals say these
vegetables and fruits cause diarrhea.

Porcara - nurses do have the power to eliminate things from the
menu.

Bradley - it is not a matter of principle to eliminate raw
vegetables and fruits.

Mrs. Webb - blamed nurses for not getting a Xmas list to the
dietary. Joe McKenna says he got it the same day.

Gen. McLain - these are internal problems that you folks should
damn well solve. ‘

Mrs. Webb - we are picking the gristle off of the meat at this
point.

Mrs. Webb - why do we have to cut french fries up into pieces;
With good teeth in children we are pulverizing oranges to orange
juice because people are scared.

McKenna - turkey could be spread on bread.

Scott - why all food to Pine going through the cuber? Who ordered
diced foods?

Mrs. Webb - cook doing butchers work tha; is why the turkey was
grounded and not cubed. Ioowoeg/rzvtay ,

Hiltner - chain of command has been subverted so often. The nurse
will be responsible for designating food sizes that people can
handle. Medical doctor will be responsible for special diets.

Nelkin - if you oppose oranges being cut up, why are you doing it?
If you oppose food being pulverized, why are you doing it?

Mrs. Webb - I was ordered to.

Nelkin to Levinson - are you Mrs. Webb's supervisor? Did you order
these changes? Are you aware who made the changes?

Levinson - yes, no, no.

Levinson - only one solution - centralized tray preparation can
eliminate problems.

Mrs. Webb - all you have to do is request utensils and you will

Hiltner - what we need is more individualization which meets’ ore
staff.

Scott - how do they get baby food in large cans all the time at
Children's Hospital and not here?

Hiltner - give us two months for memo to Liaison Committee.

Nelkin - 1) nothing new has been brought up tonight.
2) we are being asked to have faith (blind faith).
3) no reason to have faith: no answers presented tonight
and no answers in the past.

McKenna and Webb blew up at each other about lunches the I.U. is lino?

Hiltner was questioned by Alice Goldberg about why we have to
wait two months for a report.
