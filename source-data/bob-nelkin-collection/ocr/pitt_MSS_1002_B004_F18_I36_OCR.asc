This plea is respectfully submitted that you correct the
gross injustice done to the patients and staff at Polk
State School when Dr. J. H. Mcclelland was given the
"hatchet" treatment.

We are parents of 3. Polk patient and__we11 familiar with
the situation there. Dr. McC1e11and,f devoted staff
gained our confidence long ago, and ‘this recent develop-
ment has not diminished it a bit.

There is no evidence of integrity in Mrs. Wohlgemutlﬁs
purpose and method of attaining her objectives. How can
we, as parents of patients, have any confidence in
Welfare Department programs after seeing "alley cat
tactics" used. by the Director. Shame on her.

  
  
  

Sincerely,
