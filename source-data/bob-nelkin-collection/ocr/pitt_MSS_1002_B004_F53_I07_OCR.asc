MALADAPTIYE BEHAVIOR PROGRAM PROGRESS REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

February ll, 1983 - April 6, 1983

Because of the great deal of detail included in the February 11, 1983 Progress
Report in addition to all the information provided to the Board by my 1 1/2 hour
presentation on the 11th, this report will necessarily be relatively short and
brief.

In response to some of the concerns expressed by the Board with regard to our
occassional and highly circumscribed use of battery shock therapy, we are in the
process of surveying other intermediate care facilities for the mentally re-

tarded in the state of Pennsylvania to ascertain the nature of their maladaptive
behavior treatment udth a special focus on the most restrictive procedures em-

ployed by them. Thus, over the next several months we should be able to eventually
provide the Board with comparative data regarding our approach to maladaptive
behavior and the approaches of shnilar facilities in the state. These data are
intended to supplement what we already know about the prevalence of the use of battery
shock from the professional literature. '

To further insulate us from the possibility of having our treatment procedﬂres mis—~
understood, I have been in direct contact with the office of Mental Retardation in
Harrisburg, Miss Pat Gishbaugher in particular. Based on the feedback from the office
of Mental Retardation, it is clear that the Federal Regulations allow the use of
electric-battery shock and that we in general are well within the spirit of the

Federal Guidelines-with regard to its judicious use. To further document the

reality of our highly conservative use of §ve§§ion_therapie$: I am in the process of
elaborating rather significicantiy those sections of the Highland Park Center General _
Guidelines and procedﬁress for maladaptive'behavior programming that deal with
residents failure to respond to lower levels of restriction where maladaptive programming
is concerned. The elaboration and further specification of our general guidelines and
procedures for’.maladaptive programming will reﬁleet our increased sophisticationn

and complexity of policy where the treatment of significant self injurious behavior is
concerned. These revisions will be formally presented to the Human Rights Committee

for approval and incorporated into Highland Park Centers General Guidelines and Policies
for all outside reviewers to digest if they wish. These changes will also be presented
to Miss Gishbaugher of the office of Mental Retardation so that our pholosophy and
approach will be explicitly understood at the highest levels of state government. These
revisions will be made available to the Board of Directors if the Board deems such
appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,

Mario Fischetti, PHD.
