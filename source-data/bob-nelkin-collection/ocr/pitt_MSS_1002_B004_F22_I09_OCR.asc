Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth: S‘ P »4m-w‘“m_“
''''''‘’'''-'---u

I was very disheartened to read in the newspapers of your discharging
Dr. Mcclelland from his position as Superintendent of Polk State School.

It is not my intent to uphold or condemn the action of Dr. McClelland
but only to relay to you the wonderful relationship that has existed be-
tween Dr. McClelland and my family over the years, concerning my brother
who is confined at Polk State School. .

It is not possible to relay to you the many, many times that ie became
necessary to contact Dr. McClelland about problems that arose over the years
concerning the welfare of my brother. Not once that I can recall did we
not receive prompt and courteous if not sometimes personal attention from .
Dr. McClelland. It is my opinion that Dr. McClelland is an exceptional man
in his filed of endeavor, a man of compassion, integrity and devotion to
his work.

Perhaps you should consult some of the families of the inmates there
and maybe you can understand what it was like at Polk State School before
Dr. McClelland became Superintendent. Believe me, Mrs. Wohlgemuth, if you
could have seen the conditions then,you would not have been able to sleep
the rest of your days. The conditions then as compared to now are incon-
ceivable if not witnessed first hand.

It would take many pages to illustrate the many accomplishments of
Dr. McClelland at Polk State School these past 15 years. Nevertheless it
behooves me to speak out in the good Doctor's behalf. I, therefore, most
humbly request you to reconsider your decision in dismissing Dr. Mcclelland

' and take into consideration his past history and accomplishments, and not

yield to pressure groups such as the P.A.R.C., but base your opinion on
facts that can only be supplied by those individuals who have been exposed
to actual past and present conditions at Polk.

Needless to say, I am very concerned over your action and the possible
adverse effect it may have, not only on my brother but the Institution as a
whole. «

I would appreciate an early reply.

Very truly yours,
