The Honorable Helene Wohlgemuth
Secretary of Public Welfare
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:

I am writing you to protest the dismissal of Dr. James McClelland,
Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital '

I protest the firing of Dr. McClelland, both in my official capac-_

ity as a public official and as a parent. My daughter Jeanne has

‘been a patient for the past nine years at Polk State School and’

Hospital.“

My wife and I have been more than satisfied with the excellent

care our daughter has received. We have found the members of the
staff to be compassionate and dedicated, so we are appalled at the
picture that has been painted of Polk. I feel we have been attack-
ed as parents for permitting our child to be a patient at Polk.

Why was Polk State School and Hospital receiving so much phrase,
a year ago from the very same people who are now condemming Polk?

I feel thereis no justification for firing Dr. McClelland and urge
you to reinstate him immediately.

Sincerely
,/2:.:......l £2. J/<3f7“W/
