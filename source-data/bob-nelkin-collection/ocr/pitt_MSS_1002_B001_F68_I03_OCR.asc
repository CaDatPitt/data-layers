with the American Baptist home Missions Society, operating a_program' .'Q‘“°V“4

Flood is a Lt. Colonel in the Air Force Reserves, Chief of Chaplains,
and has a degree as a A.B., Ih.D. from Eastern Baptist College. He

has been associated with the development of nursing homes for the aging,
as well as group homes for delinquent and retarded persons. Mr. Wallace
Flood is also a minister in the Baptist Church, and has served as

‘To operate Park Nursing Home, they have employed Mr. Edwin

Haines Prescott. Mr. Prescott is a licensed nursing home administrator,
a graduate of Bates College in Maine, and a graduate of the Northwestern’
University School of Commerce in Hospital Administration. He has been
the Assistant Administrator of the Williampport Hospital and Administrator
of the Potsstown dospital in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. He has had 1
extensive experience in operating nursing hoses for the aging, and has
served as the President of the Eastern Regional District Hospital
Association of Pennsylvania. He has published in a variety of journals,
including the American Association of Medical Record Librarians, "Medical
Records in Extended Care Facilities”. _ '

Based on this information, a variety_of descriptive projects of
which they have undertaken, and the acquisition of an administrator with
this type of experience, I would say they are adequately prepared to
assume the responsiblity of operating the Park Nursing Home for the Retarded.
They are comitted to work with us, and have agreed to establish imediately
a Board of Directors made up of representatives from the Pittsburgh area,
as well as a Citizen Advisory Committee. Mr. William Flood has already
met with Dr. Barry Goldberg, President of the Parents‘ Group of Western
State School, and Mr. Dan Torisky, member of the Concerned Parent Group
in the greater Pittsburgh area.
