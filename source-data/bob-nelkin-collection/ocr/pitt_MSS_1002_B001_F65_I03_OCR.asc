Questions for appearance by Ginny Thornburgh:

Question; What is an interim care facility?
Comment: The State doesn't own them. They only buy services
from them.

Question: Are all interim care facilities non-profit and Church
related? _ '
Answer: No. Out of the 55 or so in Pennsylvania, 40 or more
are profit-making.

Question: How much money would a typical facility make?

Answer: That is very hard to say. The degree of profit depends
on how much the operator skimps on physical facilities,
staff and program. We can demonstrate that the least
in theory. A facility for 40 or 50 residents could net

$50,000 or more annually.

Questionfi How much is paid for each resident?
Answer: Anywhere from $11-15. You might note that a day
program such as ours costs at least $8 so for an

additional $3 to $7 an individual had to feed, clothe,

-house, provide 24 hour supervision.

Question:

schools & hospitals for the mentally retarded?

As the name implies, State school & hospital is a
State operated facility.

Cosmetically, conditions at Mountain Top were better than
Ridge View. Conversely, there was no concepted program at
Mountain*Top...outside toilet facilities...physical brutality...
tremendous staff shortages (1964 they had 24 residents with
‘ five staff and 1972 47-50 residents'with 5 staff)
would you comment on the DPW reaction to both facilities?
DPW has always had responsibility for licensing and
inspecting these places. They in essence "accredit" them.
From the Departments old files, there is a history of
violations going back years. At Hillcrest/Ridge View
it took a series of deaths, ending in Novak's alleged
murder. At Mountaintop it required the intervention of.
ACC -- even then 2 separate department inspections were
required before they were closed.

Question:
Answer:

Question: Would you elaborate on these inspections?

On Tuesday an alleged murder was revealed at Polk State
School and Hospital. Would you like to comment?
Polk is a typical state school and hospital --- over
crowded, understaffed and no program. At the most
liberal interpretation it should not have more than
2,000 residents ... enrollment is closer to 3,000.

Question:

Anéwer :

At the time of Raymond Helman's death, there was one
supervisor 2 locked doors away on the first floor ...
(discuss other Polk matters)

It seems that you are focusing on residential facilities.
Are all mentally retarded in residential facilities? Should
all of the mentally retarded be in institutions?
Definitely not. There are probably 200,000 mentally
retarded in Pennsylvania. If everyone there-now and
on the waiting list were in institutions only 25,000 would
be and that is 2 too many. The vast majority of the
mentally retarded can live in the community. These brutal
deaths are only the tip of the iceberg.

Question:

Answer:

a
The entire institutional residential system as it is now
conducted in Pennsylvania is archaic, dehumanizing and a
waste. we have warehouses for people ... and not very

good warehouses.

Recognized as a very long range goal is to close these
facilities and place them with community group homes.

Answer: They can be (Transitional living, public school
programs, work opportunities, mental stimulation,

factions (Woolslair School, East Hills, Transportation
snafoos, lack of integration, no post-secondary TMR
training program in the city or county.

Question: Didn't the Right to Education Consent Decree end this?
Answer: No. It gave us the tool .. the weapon
You can't legislate morality on the part of people.

Right to Education is a moral issue. If the legislators
do not implement it, we £ﬁ#€ﬁ#ﬁ intend to see that

they do.

older children are being retained.
