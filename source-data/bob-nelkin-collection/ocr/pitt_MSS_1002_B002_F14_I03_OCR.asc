At the direction of the Secretary and with my full
concurrences we are redirecting our extraordinary efforts with
respect to the Department's Pennhurst dispersal plan.

This decision was prompted, in part, by the Federal
Court Order of March 5, 1979, which clearly states that all
future dispersals of the plaintiff class will be coordinated
land implemented by the Office of the Special Master.

The CLA allocation letters of October 5, 1978, stipulated
a condition of funding: 151 additional Pennhurst residents were
to.be dispersed by June 30, 1979 in order to fulfill the
Department's Pennhurst Dispersal Plan. As of the end of
February, 1979, 32 dispersals had been implemented.

The fourth quarter allocation letters will reflect a
reduction in the number of Pennhurst slots specified in the
October 5 allocation letter. The changes will be consistent
with revised planning between the Southeast regional office and
the Southeast regional counties.

‘, Although the revised regional plan provides for 52
additional Pennhurst dispersals, from 3/79 to 6/30/79, other
vacant slots should be filled, as appropriate, with residents
m from other State facilities, private licensed facilities and
*. the community. The Southeast region should advise each county
to operationalize the revised plan immediately.

The Southeast regional office will be expected to monitor
the implementation of the revised plan in a concentrated manner.
Any deviation from the revised plan will require the joint
approval of the Southeast region and the Office of Mental
Retardation. Technical assistance will continue to be available
from the Office of Mental Retardation.

Any questions related to this recent decision should be
brought to my immediate attention. Your full cooperation is
essential and will be appreciated.
