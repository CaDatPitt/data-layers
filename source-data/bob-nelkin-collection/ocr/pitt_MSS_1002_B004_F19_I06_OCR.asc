Secretary of Welfare
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Sirs:

I feel that we need better support and better conditions for all
our institutions.

Sick people are not animals, but human beings who need correct care
and not treated like animals in the wild woods.

IS IT TRUE, ARE PEOPLE TODAY CIVILIZED?

Sincerely yours,

‘ Bonnie Pribich _
