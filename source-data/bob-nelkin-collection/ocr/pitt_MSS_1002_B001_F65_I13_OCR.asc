REFORMING OF THE STATE SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND INTERIM CARE COMMITTEE

The last three months have been full with ACC-PARC words and actions on interim
care. Most of those moments were planned by individuals on the Executive Committee
and Board. Now we want to regroup, involve more people, and set objectives. We
need to form stragegles and systematically express our objectives.

There is only one purpose: improve the care for our citizens by reform of the
Pennsylvania System of residential care of the mentally retarded.

Why do we need a committee? We're pleased with our efforts thus far. Will we bog
down under group education and decision making? What are the advantages of theâ€™
committee? (I) We're charged with overwhelming tasks. Unless there are many more
hands and heads, existing workers will burn out. (2) Having burned out, we'll be
long outlived by the problems. This has happened to reform movements before. The
alternative is to create an ongoing structure (this committee) where concerned
citizens can strive for excellent residential care for our citizens.

(3) We're now facing tougher issues. The obviously abusive private facilities are
being closed; but how do you close or drastically improve a non-stimulating
custodial care (yet non-abuse) facility? What actions are taken about state oper-
ated facilities with similar inadequacies? when is medication necessary as a
behavior restraint? and when is medication abusive? Unless we think through these
issues, solicit varied points of view, through debate, our answers may not be as
helpful as wished.

(4) Finally, we should relieve the burden of lengthy and time-pressured interim

care decisions from the Board of Directors. With new directors in pre-school and
opportunity center divisions, much board effort will be required for a look inward.
The Board remains the legally empowered authority of ACC-PARC. This committee will
be able to make more definitive recommendations than previously brought to the
Board. The recommendations will be the result of complete and proper discussion
by concerned citizens, a procedure to which ACC is fully committed.
