RE: Runaways at WSSH

Over the past year, I have heard rumors that there
have been numerous runaways from WSSH. To validate
these rumors, I asked Dr. Ruth Scott, Assistant
Superintendent at WSSH, to provide me with reports
of these incidents. Dr. Scott has supplied the
security report, which I am summarizing below:

1) On July 6, 1974, Mark Leonard was missing
from Pine Lodge for approximately two hours.
Later in the month, Mark drowned in the
reservoir after similarly running away.

on July 19, 1974, a couple of residents
were found at different times unsupervised
at the dam.

On July 21, 1974, another resident was
missing and returned to his unit.

On July 24, 1974, a Cedar resident was
found frightened and naked at Pine Lodge.

On July 25, 1974, a couple of residents
were missing and returned by security
or off duty attendants to their lodge.

6) On July 25, 1974, a resident was found
at the dam unsupervised.

7) On August 2, 1974, another resident was
missing and returned to his lodge.

8) On August 7, 1974, another resident was
 missing from Pine and returned to his lodge.
