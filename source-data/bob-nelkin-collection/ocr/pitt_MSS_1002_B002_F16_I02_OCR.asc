Dear Dick :

Five months have passed since the United States District
Court ordered that community services be provided to each of the sixty-
one (61) chi1dren, who then resided at Pennhurst. Unfortunate1y, the
Commonwea1th continues to deny these chi1dren of their right to minima11y
adequate habi1itation. ‘ '

Since the June 8th 1979 order, as many chi1dren 1eft

Pennhurst by dying as 1eft Pennhurst by purposefu1 p1anning. Two (2)

“chi1dren have been provided community services. Two (2) chi1dren died.

And despite the Ne1fare Department's stated priority to serve the
chi1dren, fifty«seven (57) schoo1—age residents remain at Pennhurst.

whi1e I suspect that the we1fare Department wou1d b1ame this
1ack of progress on someone e1se, the Department is cu1pab1e. The
we1fare Department, representing the Commonwea1th and you, has repeated1y
vio1ated this Federa1 Court order by fai1ing to perform basic functions,
which, notab1y, are a1so required by state 1aw and regu1ations.

As Pennsy1vania's chief executive,you might want to know 2
why the Commonwea1th is defying a federa1 judge's order, when it is easy
to comp1y ; why the Commonwea1th is defau1ting on its responsibi1ity
to these retarded chi1dren ; and why the Commonwea1th has not been ab1e ‘
to move more than two Pennhurst chi1dren to appropriate community services
in near1y a ha1f of a year. '“

I remain hopefu1 that you and your administration wi11 be

sensitive to the needs of retarded citizens and successfu1 in accomp1ish—'
ments on their beha1f.
Sincerejy,
