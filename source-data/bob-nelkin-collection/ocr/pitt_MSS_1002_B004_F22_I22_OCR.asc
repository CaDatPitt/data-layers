Dear Govenor Shappa. I

I am a senior at Edinboro State College and have
visited Polk State School and Hospital on several occasions,
and am extremely interested 9n the field of education.

I believe Dr._HcC1e11and to be a person concerned.
with each and every patient at the school. I believe
Mcclelland to be a man of integrity, concerned and devoted
to Polk. _ . .

I am not familiar with either He. Wohlgemuth or
Ms. E1kin's qualifications for passing Judgement in this
case. However, I do feel that the firing of Mcclelland and

the accusations against his staff were unfair.

Sincerely,

551m/{ 

Sarah Elliston

I have also sent this letter to Mrs. Wohlgemuth, state secretary

for the Department of Public welfare.
