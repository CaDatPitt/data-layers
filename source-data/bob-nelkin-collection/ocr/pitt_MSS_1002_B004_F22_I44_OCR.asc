My husband and I feel that we must write concerning the incredible news report of
the dismissal of Dr. James Mcclelland, the superintendent of Polk School.

For 11 years we served as pastor and wife of a church in the community of Franklin,
a few miles from Polk. During those years we had many and varied connections with the
institution.

Our 2 sons worked there. Each worked several summers in the college student pro-
gram. Many of the members of our church were employees of the school, some of them in
supervisory positions. Everyone of these persons has spoken with the highest regard
of Dr. Mcclelland, emphasizing always his adamant insistence that the patients be
treated with the utmost concern and patience. He put up with no second-rate care for
the patients there.

It was our privilege to visit often at the school, at times unannounced. Never.
was there an occasion when anyone needed to apologize for conditions.

Before we had this first hand contact with Polk, we found it difficult to advise
parents to institutionalize a retarded child; however after seeing the happy atmosphere
and concerned climate at this institution, we changed our minds, and many times used
Polk as an axample to parents trying to make a decision about a member of their family._
We are not alone in this judgment for many visitors and parents have this same opinion.
Dr. McCle1land's leadership was in large measure responsible for this atmosphere.

Do you realize what damage is being done by these quick and irrational judgments?
Not only are dedicated individuals being destroyed, but institutions are being blanketed
with a reputation that is putting fear and guilt into the hearts of those who are un-
fortunate enough to have families there.

It is no doubt true that some improvements are necessary, but care should be taken
‘to study through and be certain before accusations are made which will be more damaging
than helpful.

We must speak what we know is true and stand up to be counted in defense of a man
whom we know has stayed up all night with dying patients because he cares so much. We
must try to do our part to see that fine parts of the system are not destroyed because
Va little knowledge is a dangerous thing".

We trust you will give this matter further consideration.

Sincerely,

/4i..,24i/7797942‘
