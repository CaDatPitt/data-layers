In response to the August 20th death of Louis Novak, a
fifteen~year»o1d Allegheny County youth at Ridge View Center, the
ALLEGHENY COUNTY CHAPTER of the Pennsylvania Association for
Retarded Children (ACC-PARC) immediately dispatched an investi-
gating team to the institution. This was the third ACC~PARC
visitation to Ridge View in the past two months. The previous
visits were motivated by the death of one of the residents of
this center in a garbage compacting truck; as well as the Allegheny
County ChapterTs long standing concern that state government has
abdicated its responsibility to monitor and correct inhumane con-
ditions existing in interim care institutions. The above, coupled
with the Department of Welfare's lack of comitment to the provision
of quality services to the mentally retarded citizens of the Common-
wealth, causes us to make public the results of the investigating
team's effort. V

The Allegheny County Chapter has been working since 1970
to effect the closing of Ridge View, formerly called Hillcrest;
to obtain the removal of all Allegheny County residents from this
institution; and to halt further placement of Allegheny County
residents in this institution. It is now hoped that an enraged
citizenry can accomplish what we have been unable to accomplish

through regular channels. _ m 0 r e _

In the 16 month period that Ridge View operated this_s'-O
school, the State cited Violations of regulations and threatened
legal action to revoke Ridge View's license at least six times.

No action was taken until last week...and then only after protests
from citizen's groups regarding the alledged forced drowning of
an adolescent resident.

Reports from the DPW staff and Elliot Knauer's personal
visits to Ridge View tell of dangerous physical conditions, inade—
quate staff and supervision, filthy sanitary conditions, and deperw
sonalized living conditions. There were at least one dosen staff
reports on inadequate conditions - received by Knauer

On our most recent visit, we received reports alledging
excessive physical punishment, the use of tranquilizers asia means

of punishment, residents being asked to enforce punishment against

other residents or perform staff duties,such as bathing another res-

ident, and other improperly reported deaths.

I some of the violations cited in the first DPW report in
September, 1971 remained violations when ACC-PARC sent an inspection
team in June and August, l972.

The recommendations of the investigating team and the_
Allegheny County Chapter are:

(1): THAT THE 325 ALLEGHENY COUNTY MENTALLY RETARDED
CHILDREN AND ADULTS PRESENTLY CONFINED IN INTERIM CARE FACILITIES
THROUGHOUT THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE, INSTITUTIONALIZED. OUTSIDE‘ OF
THE WESTERN PRNNS_YLVANIA AREA AND SHOULD BE_ IMMEDIATELY RETURNED”

TO THIS REGION.

The institutional placement of the mentally retarded
must be close enough that parents, friends and relatives may.
frequently visit--and close enough that Mental Health/Mental
Retardation officials can fulfill their responsibility to monitor

these services.

(2) THAT HELENE WOHLGEMUTH, SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WELFARE,
IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATE ALL INTERIM CARE FACILITIES: THEIR PRO~
GRAMS, EMPLOYEES, PLACEMENT PROCEDURES, LIVING CONDITIONS, AND
THE REGULATIONS FOR LICENSURE.

FURTHER, THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE DISCON-

’TINUE AND PROHIBIT CONTRACTING OF MENTAL RETARDATION SERVICES TO

PRIVATE, PROFIT MAKING CONCERNS.

The Allegheny County Chapter has guaranteed the Secre-
tary that the Chapter will be unyielding on conditions that need
correction. We promise to continue our investigations throughout
the State, wherever an Allegheny County resident is warehoused,
and, as advocates for the retarded, we will not relent until the

safety of all is guaranteed.

(3) THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE RESCIND THE
CONTRACTS FOR THE SEVEN PROPOSED COMMUNITY RESIDENCES THEY HAVE
BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH COMMONWEALTH CONCERNS, INC.

FURTHERMORE, THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE CEASE
NEGOTIATING ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS WITH COMMONWEALTH CONCERNS, INC.

This is demanded in light of the conditions at Ridge View
which is operated by this combine, Commonwealth Concerns, Inc.

(4) THAT, BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURE TO ACT AS AN ADVOCATE
FOR THE CHILDREN AT RIDGE VIEW; BECAUSE HE WAS AWARE OF RIDGE
VIEW CONDITIONS THROUGH STAFF REPORTS AND HIS OWN PERSONAL VISITS;
AND BECAUSE HE FAILED TO ENFORCE HIS MANY COMPLIANCE ORDERS TO
RIDGE VIEW, WE QUESTION THE RIGHT OF THE REGIONAL SECRETARY OF
PUBLIC WELFARE, ELLIOTT R. KNAUER, TO CONTINUE IN THAT POST.

THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY CHAPTER THEREFORE CALLS FOR THE

RESIGNATION OF ELLIOTT R. KNAUER.

(5) THAT GOVERNOR MILTON SHAPP IMMEDIATELY INSTRUCT
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO CONDUCT A SPECIAL INVESTIGATION
INTO ALL OF THE REPORTED AND ALLEGED INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED
AT RIDGE VIEW, FORMERLY HILLCREST.

The Allegheny County Chapter is calling for this special
investigation because of the long history of deaths, reported
brutalities, inhumane living conditions, and excessive number of
run—away residents.

Over the years, Wayne County Coroner, Robert Jennings,
has investigated and attempted to publicize and bring to justice
those individuals responsible for the heinous conditions at Ridge
View Center and Hillcrest. State government must now assume
the responsibility since Coroner Jennings, a local official, has
been frustrated in his every effort.

Both Coroner Robert Jennings and the attorneys for the

family of Louis Novak concur with this demand.

(6) THAT A SPECIAL GRAND JURY BE CONVENED TO DETERMINE
WHAT CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS SHOULD BE INSTITUTED.

(7) THAT THE MISSING ALLEGHENY COUNTY RESIDENT OF WHITE
DEER, ANOTHER INTERIM CARE FACILITY IN HAWLEY, PENNSYLVANIA, BE
FOUND IMMEDIATELY. FURTHER, THAT A COMPLETE REPORT OF THIS INCIDENT
BE MADE PUBLIC.

This youth has been missing long enough for the state to

be concerned about the continuance of their reimbursement to White

'Deer for his care. The Allegheny County Chapter, conversely, is

intensely interested in his well-being.
THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY CHAPTER REQUESTS THAT ALL CITIZENS
WRITE TO THE GOVERNOR AND THEIR LEGISLATORS DEMANDING THAT:

—- a special investigation by the Justice Department into
the deaths, brutalities, living conditions and run-
aways at Ridge View.

-- the Department of Public Welfare stop contracting with
Commonwealth Concerns, Inc.

-— the Department of Public Welfare conduct an immediate
and ongoing investigation of all interim care facilities
for the mentally retarded.

-- a resignation be obtained from Deputy Secretary of
Public welfare, Elliott R. Knauer, and others responsible
for allowing the continuance of inhumane conditions at

Ridge View.

-- the State government demonstrate its commitment to.
services to mentally retarded children and adults by
restoring the $l0.962 million dollars removed from
services to the mentally retarded due to the $12
million cut in the appropriation to the Department

of Welfare.
