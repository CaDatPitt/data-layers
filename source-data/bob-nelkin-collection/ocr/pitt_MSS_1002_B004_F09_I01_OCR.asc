lmplemenTaTion of Pederaleyedjcal STandardS

McCielland said ThaT héihadsThree1gocTors To give medical examinaTions To 3,000
paTienTs, To examine This number when There was liTT|e expecTaTion of "sorTing
_Them ouT" To meeT.sTandards, was.an exercise of fuTi|iTy.

Bgjldinq RenovaTion “

This relaTes To The above. McCielland sTaTed ThaT The lasT GSA renovaTion resulTed
in fewer saniTary faciliTies Than Those ThaT previously exisTed. FurTher, Thaf The
screening of.showers and ToileTs made iT "impossible" for aTTendanTs To geT in and
assisT Their severely handicapped paTienT. Mcclelland sTaTed ThaT he was noT enThu—
siasTic abouT breaking‘exisTing wards inTo sleeping rooms since The exisTing over-
Vcrowding«made supervision diffLculT enough. In addiTion, The cosT efficiency facTor
for The renovaTion could be acheived beTTer by "building a new facilify."

Transfer of 1,000 PaTienTs‘

Mcclelland viewed wiTh enThusiasm’The expecTaTion of reducing his paTienT load by 1/3.
SomerseT STaTe School and HospiTal, in his opinion, was an excellenT possibiliTy. If
The people were To be selecTed by geography (i.e., one counTy) or homogeneously from
The SquThwesT region would have To be deTermined. '

"McClelland sTaTed ThaT:They should be Taken ouT of Polk in i/2 dozens or dozens.

NoTe - C. A. PeTers disagreed. FelT They should be moved in large groups. Preferably
wiTh The So§erseT STaTe'School and HospiTa| aTTendanTs spending a week or Two wiTh
Them aT Polk'prior To The move.i

TransiTional Services .

McCle||and sTaTed ThaT approximafely i5 ex—Polk residenfs have reTurned from TransiTional
Services; some more Than once.

_ «Roughly 1/2 have been reTurned because They required hospiTalizaTion for medical
lproblems as a resulT of accidenfs, eTc. One has beeh reTurned because she became
psychoTic. This condiTion exisTed while she was aT Polk STaTe School and HospiTal.

 

 

   

The remaining 7 or 8 reTurned "because They goT bored", "because There was no work",
"because There was noThing To do..."

McClelland sTaTed ThaT he had Tried To impress on TransiTional Services ThaT The firsT
100 ouT of Polk were "choice candidaTes" for dispersal. He also sTaTed ThaT Polk made
clear To TransiTional Services ThaT The second 100 and The balance ThereafTer would
require much closer supervision and a longer period before They can move To aparTmenTs.
According To McClelland, he suggesTed To Royer ThaT he use his maximum supervision
faciliTies for These menTally reTarded as opposed To puTTing Them in unsupervised or
minimum supervision siTuaTions.

Conclusion

if The 1,000 people can be moved ouT of Polk, There will be a raTio of almosT one
sTaff To each paTienT. SorTing ouT for Federal medical sTandards, individual programming,
righT To educaTion and normalizaTion may Then be obTained. ~

Of equal imporTance, McClelland's besT defense (i.e., overcrowding) will be removed.
