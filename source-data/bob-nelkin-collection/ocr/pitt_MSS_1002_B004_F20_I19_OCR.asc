Dear Sir:

Our son Martin, 18, is a resident at Polk State School & Hospital. Martin
is autistic. He treats people as objects. He has no sense of right or wrong. He
is not educable, cannot talk, is highly hyperactive, and at times becomes unmanageable.
Before he was institutionalized at the age of 7. he gleefully destroyed two litters of

.kittens by hurling them against the bedroom walls. When discovered, he exhibited abso-

lutely no remorse. Had his baby sister been a victim of his violence, the response
would have been the same. Were Martin to be returned to his home (is this the PARC's
aim for all such children?), he would require full—time supervision. But my wife would
be unable to cope with his superior strength and agility, should he become violent or
decide on impulse to run away. 4

‘Mrs. _ and I thank God for Polk State School & Hospital. We have been
delighted with the excellent care Martin has received there. We have found members of
the staff to be compassionate and dedicated. Thanks to mild sedatives, prescribed by
a staff physician, Martin has not required restraints or confinement. But we would
have no objection whatever should it become necessary to place him in one of the play-
pens (cages??) which have aroused the ire of Welfare Secretary Helene Wohlgemuth. What
alternative measures does Mrs. Wohlgcmuth suggest for preventing emotionally disturbed
patients from harming others and themselves? It is well enough for her to moralise _
from her ivory tower in Harrisburg. I would like to see her on the firing line, where I”
the action is-—as an attendant in one of the cottages, confronted by an aggressive
patient in the midst of an explosive temper tantrum. How would ghg handle the situation?

Yesterday I drove to Polk with Martin's Easter basket. At least three patients
stopped me in the halls and asked with great concern if I thought Dr. McC1elland would
be coming ack. I told them I hoped so. They inquired if I had signed the petition in
Central imploring the governor to rescind Mrs. Wohlgemuth's arbitrary action and re-
store Dr. MeClelland to his Dost. I assured them that I had, and further that I would
write a letter to Governor Shapp.

In conference with a top administrator, I was told that Dr. McClel1and has
virtually the unanimous support of both staff and patients. My source sees the removal
as the outcome of a clash in philosophy whereby the Harrisburg establishment is seeking
to replace medical dootor—administrators with specialists in social work. This they

- have now succeeded in accomplishing at all Pennsylvania institutions for the mentally

handicapped, Polk being the last. The "cages" were a pretext-—an excuse to justify the

.1ong—plotted action. Actually, when Secretary wohlgemuth made her surprise visit two

weeks ago only 5 pens were in use-l each at 5 of the school's 39 residence units..

Only one of the.5' cubicles had a top——and this was to control an excessively aggressive
female patient who is only 4'6" tall (so that standing upright y_s_1__§ possible). At x_;_o__
time was any of the pens padlocked. And never were patients shut up for hours and for-

_ gotten. when their temper outbursts subsided, they were released. Dr. McClellan ac-

ceded to the demand that the objectionable devices be eliminate. Still, a few days
later he was fired--in a peremptory mnner which blatantly violated his civil rights.

Dr. Mcclelland has enjoyed a distinguished career as superinténdent at Polk.
Under his leadership the Polk State School & Hospital has come to be recognized as one
of the finest institutions of its type in the nation. In view of his outstanding suc-
cess-and Mrs. Wohlgemuth's haughty intransigence-perhaps the situation should be re-
versed. Dr. MsClelland should be reinstated and Hrs. Wohlgemuﬂh should be given the ax.
