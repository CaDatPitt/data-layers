LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH LAWYER SUPPORTS WOHLGEMUTH FIRING OF POLK INSTITUTION

SUPERINTENDENT BUT ATTACKS USE OF SECLUSION AND RESTRAINTS IN LOCAL "

HOSPITALS
Z1-3'-.-jj

David Ferleger, Esq., Director of the Mental Patient Civil Liberties
Project, a Philadelphia organization doing legal and advocacy services
for mental patients, today expressed full support of Helene Wohlgemuth,
Secretary of Public Welfare, in her decision to fire the superintendent
of the Polk State School and Hospital for maintaining "cages" in which

patients were kept.‘

"Such degradation of fellow human beings by institutional administrators
is indefensible, both morally and legally. This practice demonstrates,in
a concrete and tragic way, the almost total powerlessness of inmates

in such facilities," Mr. Ferleger stated.

Mr. Ferleger explained that similar, though less blatant, abuses exist
here in the Philadelphia area. Local mental hospitals use "seclusion"
rooms and mechanical restraints for the control of alleged "management"
problems. Seclusion is a euphemism for solitary confinement, Mr. Ferleger
said. "These small locked rooms have no furniture except a pad or bare
mattress on the floor; the floor and walls are cold and tiled. Access to

a toilet depends upon the discretion of attendants."

Despite official policies which would permit patients to be secluded

or restrained only upon order of a doctor, Mr. Ferleger states that

his observations have led him to conclude that policy is often violated.
"Seclusion is used for punishment and to get an annoying patient out

of the hair of already-overworked attendants," the attorney declares.

A psychiatrist has stated to Mr. Ferleger that, "Many patients will

settle down if you talk to them." However, most staff are too ready--

-some even anxious-- to 1ock.the patient up, Mr. Ferleger claims.

"Perhaps the cages at Polk are even more humane than the out-of-the-way
seclusion used in our local hospitals, at least the patients there
could speak with and see other human beings. In seclusion, one is

cut off completely from one's fellow patients. I know of one case in

which a patient was locked away in seclusion for most of five days

although she was a voluntary patient theoretically free to leave

, upon request, Mr. Ferleger commented.

Mr. Ferleger called for a complete review and survey of all state
mental institutions for abuses of patient rights. Only in this way,
he contends, will the citizens of the Commonwealth be assured that

these violations of legal and human rights are curtailed and eliminated.
