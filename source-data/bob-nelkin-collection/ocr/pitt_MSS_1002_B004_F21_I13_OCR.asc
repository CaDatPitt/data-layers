Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter in regards to the action taken by

the State Welfare Secretary, Mrs. Helene Nohlgemuth to fire
Dr. James H. Mcclelland of Polk State School in Polk, Pa.

I have hesitated in writing a letter until I had a chance

to view both sides of this issue and am now prepared to defend
Dr. Mcclelland. 7*‘

I myself have visited the Polk School located in Polk, Pa.

as a visitor on a tour. I observed patients of various ages

and mental capacities. On the tour, visitors were not permitted
to view the agressive patients for our own safety.

I truly believe that if the thousands of.school employees and
staff as wel as many local and county organizations are fully
supportinq this nan and his position in his duties as head of
the school, then I can see no inhumane intention toward any of
his patients in the procedure of usinw the so-called "cages"
for the aggressive patients. The use of the playpens are much
more appealing to me than the use of straight jackets or the
injection of dru3s., ~

As a young mother of a 5-month old son, I would have no objection
to admitting my son or any other child to Polk State School and
under the supervision of Dr. Mcclelland, if the occasion were
that the child needed the attention of such staff at a mental

,school and home.

The mere fact that the cages thenseives were on public display
and not hidden fron view is fact enough to me that the school

was doing the right thing in using them for specific patients.

I'm sure that Dr. McClelland and his staff is and has been
investigating different means of protecting the aggressive patient
and yet allowing them some open-ness to the rest of the patients
at the school. ~

For the above reason, I sincerely hope that you will attempt
to do all you can to reinstate Dr. Mctlelland and protect his

,professional'character as Superintendent of Polk School.

Sincerely,

Copy to:

Mrs. Helene Nohlzemuth
