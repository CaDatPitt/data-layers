THE HONORABLE MILTON J. SHAPP
GOVERNOR

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA
STATE CAPITOL BUILDING
HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA

DEAR GOVERNOR SHAPP2

‘THERE IS LITTLE NEED FOR ME TO FAMILIARIZE YOUR OFFICE
WITH THE PRESENT CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE ABRUPT DISMISSAL
OF DR. JAMES MCCLELLAND AS SUPERINTENDENT OF POLK STATE SCHOOL,

POLK, PENNSYLVANIA.

THIS LETTER IS IN COMPLETE CONCURRENCE WITH THE MANY
THOUSANDS OF REGIONAL RESIDENTS WHO HAVE PROTESTED THE ACTION
OF WELFARE SECRETARY, HELENE WOHLGEMUTH, RELATIVE TO THE FIRING
OF DR. MCCLELLAND. ‘

THIS PROTEST IS NOT TO DEMEAN THE CAPABILITIES OF MRS. WOHLGEMUT
IN HER APPROACH TO HER MANY JOBS, BUT RATHER TO SEEK INFORMATION
TO A SITUATION THAT REQUIRES A TWO-FOLD EXPLANATION. .

FIRST- THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HER DISMISSAL OF
DR. MCCLELLAND ARE FROM MY OWN PERSONAL GATHERINGS COMPLETELY UN-
,FOUNDED, AND SPECIFICALLY SHOULD HAVE BORNE AN INVESTIGATION BEFORE
AN ACTION OF SUCH FINALITY WAS TAKEN BY THE WELFARE SECRETARY.

SECONDLY- IT SEEMS INCONCIEVEABLE TO ME THAT THIS MAN'S
LOVE AND DEDICATION TO DUTY COULD BE DISMISSED IN AN ACTION THAT
SMACKS OF MEDIEVAL TYRANNY AND MODERN POLITICAL PUTRIDITY IN THIS
DAY OF ENLIGHTENED GOVERNMENT.

ON WEDNESDAY, APRIL 18, I SPENT SOME TWO HOURS IN RECORDED
INTERVIEWS WITH STAFF REPRESENTATIVES OF POLK SCHOOL, AS WELL AS A
PERSONAL INVESTIGATION OF THE CHARGES OF CRUEL AND INHUMANE TREAT-
MENT ALLEGEDLY TAKING PLACE AT THE SCHOOL AS CHARGED BY THE WELFARE

SECRETARY.

I25 SOUTH BROAD STREET - TELEPHONE 456-6500
GROVE cIrY,pA. 16127

I SPOKE WITH WHOMEVER I CHOSE AND WAS ESCORTED TO ANY BUILDING

THAT I SO CHOSE TO VISIT, AND FRANKLY, COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE

OF CRUEL, DEGRADING OR INHUMAN CONDITIONS AT POLK STATE SCHOOL.

IF INDEED THESE CONDITIONS WERE PRESENT IN MRS. WOHLGEMUTH'S

RECENT VISIT TO THE SCHOOL, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXISTENCE
UPON MY VISIT. '

THEREFORE, IT IS MY CONCLUSION AND THE CONCLUSION OF

MANY WHO HAVE HEARD THIS STATION'S TAPED INTERVIEW PROGRAM CON-
CERNING THIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION THAT YOUR OFFICE INSTITUTE

A COMPLETE AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MATTER WITH YOUR
FINDINGS MADE PUBLIC THROUGH THE MEDIA.

I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT IF AN IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION
WERE MADE AT THIS TIME, YOU WOULD FIND REGIONAL RESIDENTS AND
THOSE WHO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION OF A POLK-TYPE SCHOOL
TO BE IN THE VERY HIGH MAJORITY OPINION THAT DR. JAMES MCCLELLAND
BE REINSTATED AS SUPERINTENDENT OF POLK STATE SCHOOL.
