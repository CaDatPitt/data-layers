Their goal: a written plan. located onpne ward- f9_r every resident -

Unit Ill -

More active than residents of Units i and ii.

Unit IV -

Population 85

Activity: Some residents coloring - good stereo - T.V. popular.

Walls in bedroom - pink.

C.C.A. reported that balls had once been allowed in the daygroom
but had been removed due to the danqer of breaking lights.
Sunnyside Summary

The potential for functioning outside an institutional setting of
this group in general was great.

Wall to wall beds - no privacy.
Overcrowded.
No or minimal activity - no privacy.

C.C.A.'s acted as room guards rather than program or personal
stimulators - little or no interaction.

501 of the 364 residents are off Sunnyside for an 8 hour day.

Juvenile pictures (e.g. ducks and pandas) on Unit I and IV
wlndowshades.

General perception by staff that these were boys, not men.

Could staff turnover be reduced if they were made to feel more
useful and creative?

Have drugs been reduced on this unit?

Residents and staff were openaand friendly.

Almost all residents on Sunnyside are toilet trained (unlike
Gardenside).

Chairs on Sunnyside are quite comfortable -- benches are un-
attractive and brutally hard.

Southside Parade

Occurs every day. All those who are not included in another
program...The young women walk several miles each day and seemed
in good spirits...Staft seemed positive about it also -- Both
gain. Hurray! The newly installed "activity period? on each unit
has potential.

Northside

Overwhelminggfeeling of great ability and competence of these
children:--Do they belong in an institution or do they belong in a
community school?

3:15 p.m. Return from school. Potential abuse situation - Mr. McCord.

At the time of our visit - 3 child care workers to take care of 50 boys
(Unit ll — 7 to 16 years: and Unit IV - 14 to 18 years)

25 boys live and sleep in the same room. (Cottage ll's bathroom
was being renovated.)

General feelinq: These 50 boys should have been outside runninq
and/or playing ball.

Gardenside (Female)

A. Under 21

B. More emotionally disturbed
C. Aid cottage

D. Older, generally "easier"

Terrible odor throughout . CCA§s felt that cages are more
humane than tying residents to benches. "Things haven't changed.“

Dress Tremendous challenge of women's clothing on this unit.
Dresses appear to be used for toileting and diapering ease,
although most residents do not sit becomlngly in dresses. Slacks
would be more appropriate. Has creative thought been given to the
design of clothing for those women who seem to want to take all of
their clothing aft?
