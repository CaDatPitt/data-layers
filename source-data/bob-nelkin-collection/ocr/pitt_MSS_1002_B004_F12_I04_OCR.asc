;S_“,pAConsidering that the subject of telephone conversations between residents of
‘; this school and members of their families was pretty well explored during our tele-
}j;phone conversation of the morning of September 23, I972, I have had difficulty per-
=fjsuading myself that written response about it was owing. Finally, however, I have

sﬁiconsidered that you do deserve an answer as you indicated, and so here it is.

.,*f“7 First let me say I realize full well that free access to established methods

‘of communication between residents of a place like this and their families is a.. -
g matter of much importance and concern in today's world. It is likely that there
*"may come a time when with additional facilities and personnel that the free use of-
53telephones by residents may become an established practice. That time, however, is

:g;5g;tnot yet, and as far as I can see with what little vision of the future I possess~t

i;fis not in prospect. Secondly our concern this past year has been to increase our‘
p;#p;2§telephone facilities in order to expedite the conduct of business. Such progress as
a*v1ﬂ_we have made has not even completely solved our problems in this respect.

_fI¥;5;t"iI am sure that you are aware that the tempo of our world is steadily accelerat-
M_ _.t ing, and this has been very much reflected of recent years even in this somewhat out
. *5, of the way place. -Probably, also, acceleration will continue from month to month,

 

'*5:§ﬁ~ and.year to year.

£ 1 From the point of view of sheer practicality and what is possible I cannot at this
_ -time promise with any certainty of attainment any change in the direction in which you’
1”: would have the institution go relative to facilitating telephone communication by resi-
' dents-for the institution's population either generally or selectively.

_ __ Insofar as your particular situation is concerned, however, I am willing upon

, '”jh-telephone notice from you or your secretary to me to arrange for Nancy to make
_Wf fa return call to you through the pay phone in our lobby with the help of one of the
"i"? employes assigned to her cottage in the same manner as was done last September. I

. ,f-have no objection to so doing, and will be pleased to do so whenever the request is
fﬂf made._ I trust that this solution will prove to be of satisfaction to you. It is the
?}f,best_that I can offer at this true.

Very truly yours ,
