RE:

Paul 0-

w regarding

Our records indicate that Paul was first referred to
western State School May 16, 1973. At that time Paul's parents
were not seeking admission but, rather, had made application in
the event that admission was required at a later time.

Dear Representative Heinz:

Thank you for your letter of Marc
Paul GIIIIIIII, son of Mr. and Mrs. George
_ Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15212.

 

On March 5, 1975, we received an inquiry from the
Northern Communities Mental Health/Mental Retardation Program
regarding the possibility of admitting Paul on eigher a short
or long term basis. Because of western State's current condi-
tion of overcrowding, particularly on our residence units for
non-ambulatory residents like Paul, it has been necessary for
us to offer our assistance in finding alternative placement
and to indicate that admission to western was not possible at
this time. I might add that I learned from our Social Service
Department late last week that Paul has been admitted to Kane
Hospital.

It is a matter of some concern to me that Mrs. B
believes that P.A.R.C. w t to hinder the admission 0 er
son. I fear that Mrs. B has received erroneous informa-
tion. P.A.R.C. has been quite concerned, as has the administra-
tion of western State, about the overcrowded conditions which
exist in our residence units for our most disabled residents.
Our concern regarding overcrowding has been intensified because
of the fact that unless we are able to reduce our overcrowding
It is because
of the concern for the health and safety of present residents
of western State that both P.A.R.C. and western have sought
alternatives to placement at western for individuals like Paul.
