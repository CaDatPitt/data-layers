Pa. aide
stirs ire
of judge

-   ‘ He hears criticism
of Pennhurst case

By A.w. GEISELMAN JR._
Of The Bulletin Staff

.- U.S. District. Judge Raymond J .-‘
Broderick said yesterday he may);
hold Pennsylvania Welfare Secre-1»
tary Helen O’Bannon in contempt off
court because of her videotaped crit-.
icism of the Pennhurst Center case. 

Broderick said yesterday that also
will consider a request that officials
. of the state and Philadelphia, Bucks,

Delaware and Montgomery counties

be cited for contempt for not comply-

ing with a March 2 order that 50

Pennhurst residents be placed back

in the community by June 30.

The tape of a Dec. 12, I980, inter-
view with Mrs. O’Bannon on ABC
News was shown at a hearing yester-
day on a request that she and other
state Public Welfare Department of-
ficials be cited for contempt.

Mrs. O’Bannon was accused of
urging the state Legislature to cut;-.‘
off funds for two masters named by '
Broderick to expedite'the phasing
out of the state institution in Chester
County. ;_

The request for the citation was‘
made by attorneys for the Pennsyl-
vania Association of Retarded Citi-
zens (PARC) and individual resi-
dents of Pennhurst.

Mrs. O’Bannon was not at the
hearing.

But in the ABC interview, she de-
clared: “We should in no way be
forced to dump _these people into
unaccepting, hostile environments,
where they can't get services and
where they will be shoved in the
back rooms and attics that replace
the back wards of these institutions -
of yesteryear." ’ ‘

An angry Broderick wanted to
know if this actually was the Welfare
Department's view of his 1978 order.
. which mandated “suitable communi-,.‘ ’

ty living arrangements" for‘
Pennhurst residents.

Deputy Attorney G_en. Robert B.

Hoffman attempted to placate the.

‘ judge and said the statement was
taken out of context. He claimed
Mrs. O’Bannon was not opposed to.
his program of returning the retard- “K

- ed to the community, but concerned’
that it would be done without proper:
preparation. . A -

The Welfare Department had
asked the Legislature for $900,000 to
fund the offices of Pennhurst. special
master and hearing master in the
state's 1981-82 budget.

The figure was reduced to $35,000,
after Mrs. O’Bannon told the House
Appropriations Committee last
March she would not comply with
Broderick’s order to set a timetable

‘ to phase out the institution.
