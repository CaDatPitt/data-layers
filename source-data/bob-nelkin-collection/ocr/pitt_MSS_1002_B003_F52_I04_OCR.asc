This letter expresses my opinion that the Pennsylvania Department of
Education has failed to implement Paragraph 5l of the Consent Agreement with respect to
institutionalized mentally retarded students, and has failed to follow the procedures
of Chapter l3 of the School Code which calls for the education of all handicapped
children. ' ' ' » *

when the Consent Agreement was signed, it was agreed that all students
would be accorded equal treatment under law, and that neither the fact of retardation
nor the artifact of residence would obstruct equal treatment under the School Code. The
Code very clearly states that the primary responsibility for providing education rests with
the local School District, with the provision that certain services can be provided by
contractural arrangements with the Intermediate Unit. For the most part, this procedure
has been followed for all mentally retarded students, except those in state schools and
hospitals. For state school students the Department of Education circumvented the School
Code with interdepartmental agreement. I am now questioning the legality of certain
provisions of this action. The interdepartmental agreement, reached with the Department
of Public welfare, placed the responsibility for educating the state school and hospital
students on the I.U. Because the I.U. operates with serious constraints, the effect of
this agreement has been discriminatory. Unlike a local School District, the Intermediate
Unit does not have the power to tax nor does it have the authority to construct classroom
facilities. Consequently, now three years after the Consent Agreement was signed, the
majority of state school students are not receiving an appropriate program of education
and training. It is acknowledged by all that the lack of classroom space is the most
serious problem. I.U. personnel have not been able to solve the space problem. Their
failure is not due to a lack of to nitment, but to a leg” or authority. The Znte:r:”‘
Unit is trying to meet a School District responsibility without the capabilities and
authority accorded a local School District. Consequently, the institutionalized mentally
retarded are not accorded equal treatment under the School Code.

Lacking authority to implement their mandate, the Intermediate Units in
some instances have had to propose that the Department of Public welfare allow for the
construction of classrooms on the grounds of the State Schools and Hospitals for the pur-
pose of lease to the Intermediate Unit. In two instances, Hamburg and white Haven, the

Secretary of Education, John Pittenger, has concurred. This concurrence was given in
spite of the Department's affirmation that this solution is the least desirable option
for the education of state school students. Furthermore, this concurrence raises the
further question-of possible non-compliance with Department's assurances to the Federal
Government under Part “B” of the Education of the Handicapped Act. These assurances
quote the School Code citing the responsibility of the local School District to educate
all handicapped students and furthermore, states that this education shall occur in the
least restrictive setting. ' '

. we are opposed to the classrooms being constructed on the grounds of the
state schools and hospitals. Such plans are the results of"a faulty planning process,
it is not the least restrictive setting, and we are appalled at the failure to date to
provide these students with an appropriate program of education and training.

We request that the Department of Education communicate with the School
Districts, where state schools and hospitals are located, and facilitate these Districts
to meet their legal responsibility and to speedily implement the provisions of the
School Code. If the School Districts fail to comply, then in accordance with paragraph

- 51 of the Consent Agreement, we request "... the Secretary of Education,pursuant to section

l3.72 (5) of the Public School Code of T949, 24 PURD. STAT. l3.72 (5), shall directly
provide, maintain, administer, supervise, and operate programs for the evaluation of these.
children". '

Jack, I am requesting a legal review of the opinions expressed in this
letter, and legal advise as to what steps to follow to remedy the non-compliance that.

‘ currently exists and the worsening non-compliance that will result when state school and

hospital students are actually assigned to the classrooms currently proposed..
