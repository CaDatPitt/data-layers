Ms. Helen wohlgemuth
Secretary of welfare
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Ms. Uohlgemuth,

I am a Special Education teacher and have a severely retarded daughter
living at Polk State School. Therefore, I feel more than oualified to

express my great distress caused by your recent firing of Dr. James McClelland,

‘superintendent of Polk State School.

Your abrupt action indicates to me that you have very little intimate
knowledge of severely and profoundly retarded children and adults. There are
individuals who require close supervision and partial confinement in a play-
penulike enclosure For their safety and the safety of others. This is not
cruel and inhumane, it is sensible action taken For safety. Some of the
children and adults do reouire rather heavy medication at various times be-
cause of severely aggressive behavior.

It is my opinion, and the opinion of various proFessiona1'oersons that I
have discussed this matter with, that partial confinement used in conjunction
with some medication is far preferable, more humane, and more sensib1e.course
of action. ‘This gives aides and teachers the opportunity to work with and try
to help the residents.

Play pens are used by many parents of young children to keep them safe
and not isolated. Many residents of Polk are still very young children
though they are physically mature.

My daughter is and has been receiving excellent care at Polk. Dr.
Mcﬁlelland is responsible For a fine program of high quality care For all the
patients in his care. I.do not understand how you can possibly charge him
with inhumane treatment. He could not possibly have held his pgsition at‘
Polk as administrator for so long a time or be so highly respected by his
employees, parents of patients, professionals is his field,-and many other
DBUDIB, if your charges were true.

I believe that you have made a very serious error in judgement. It is
my sincere wish that you reconsider this extremely serious decision and re-
instate Dr. McClelland at Polk so that he can continue to administer a pro-
gram which is progressive, thoughtful, and has great concern for the welfare
and best interests of its residents.
