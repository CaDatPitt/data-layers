Dear Mr. Folloni:

The Allegheny County Hental Health/Rental Retardation/Drug and
Alcohol Program supports the goal of better services for individuals who
are presently residents at Polk Center and, thus. supports in principle the
recently established goal of decreasing the census at Polk Center by
_approximately 584 individuals. Although most of the references to this
current focus on dispersing an additional 584 individuals has been to
I increase Polk Center's potential to earn H.A. funding, we know you are
committed to better services for these individuals and that that remains
the primary goal.
. As this office works to accomplish these goals for Allegheny
County residents at Polk Center. we will also be assessing and planning
for the needs of present community residents. The County Administrator
clearly has a responsibility to integrate these demands for services for
both philosophical and pragmatic reasons. If there were_not integration
of these clients in services, we would run the risk of developing mini
'institutions in Allegheny County. we must also respond to the d hands for
services for community residents because of their needs, and these are th
constituents who will actively approach the elected officials at both the
County and State level. If "the community" feels that all the services are
being diverted toward institutional residents so the state can earn
additional funding through M.A., and do not see services being developed to
meet the needs of community residents, the support for our program at a
number of levels will diminish. Therefore, in conjunction with our planning
for continuation of the dispersal effort, the County Office will be working
with the catchment areas to determine the needs (CLA, day program, other

§g support services) of community residents. Our plan for the dispersal will

:3 include provisions for these community services as well as the need of rolk

,‘ Center residents. At present, our estimate is that implementation of the

‘0 plan that will be developed will require at least l8 months. and could he

However, an adequate needs assessment needs to be accomplished so that we
might better plan for the types and range of services that will be needed.

. The Allegheny County Base Service Unit monitors will again be reviewing
the residents at Polk Center and current satellite sites this spring.
This process has already started. Once their data has been collected, it
will be used to make any modification necessary to the program and CLA
needs already specified. -

The discussions to date have focused on the development of
community living arranéement programs for present Polk Center residents.
At this time, it is my judgment that our capacity to serve approximately
150 individuals reouires that residential services in addition to CLA need
to be developed. There are several reasons for this. First, the Allegheny
County NH/HR/D&A system has undergone significant expansion in the area of
community living arrangements this past fiscal year due to the recent
dispersal programs at Marcy Habilitation Center and western Center. This
has ' -

The second point is that at present, we wish to maintain a 50/50
ratio in CLA programs.. we feel this is necessary for programmatic reasons
as well as our desire to serve both community and Polk Center residents.
with this consideration in mind, we have modified the CLA Plan for FY 77-78.
we have made a small increase in the number of programs and the capacity
which we are proposing to serve. It is important to note that we do not
feel the "slots" are interchangeable. That is to say, the plan was
developed based upon community and institutional resident needs and our
estimates of the potential providers and their capacity for FY 77-78.‘ Thus,
we feel each of the programs are needed. we do not believe that one program
can be exchanged for the other. If your office were to establish a priority
that adult programs are more needed than children's programs, we do not
necessarily think we can simply develop two additional adult programs in
, place of the two children's programs we are requesting. Also, in determin-

ing the number of "slots" for Polk Center residents, we are committed to
serving residents from Polk and/or its satellites within each CLA program

at a 50/50 ratio. Thus, if we are unable to develop a particular program,
such as a DMU, the number of "Polk slots" in the CLA plan for FY 77-78
would be decreased accordingly. .

Given these considerations, we think there is need to explore
alternatives such as creating or utilizing Intermediate Care Facilities
that could meet the individuals‘ needs. we have begun to explore some
possibilities and will continue to do so. .

Another concern of ours is the geriatric population identified_
by the Polk Center Social Service Department. Our first concern relates
to-the advisability of attempting significant transfers of a geriatric
‘population. These individuals are the most likely, as a group, to be .
effected negatively by significant change in”their living situation. '
Certainly. our judgment would-be_that in many instances the "quality of

Q

life" that can be provided them in a different environment would be
significantly better. However, we doubt that the majority of these indiv-
iduals share that judgment with us, and we are sincerely concerned about
the negative effect on them. There is also a significant problem in
Allegheny County at the present time regarding residential services for
individuals over age 55. Kane Hospital is having critical problems and
this places increased pressure on the service system in Allegheny County
for individuals in this category. Thus, we feel there is a need for much
more exhaustive review of these individuals, their needs, and our capacity
to serve them. We look forward to discussing this issue with you.

For any CLA programs that are developed for Polk Center residents,
we anticipate that more intensive levels of service will be required. This
obviously will be reflected in the costs for CLA programs.. In regard to
day program and support services for this project, a figure of Sl2.UU"per
day has been used in the past to provide for such services. I doubt this
figure will be adequate in the future. This is particularly true since
the Polk Center residents will probably require more intense services over
a longer period of time. Thus, our budget for day program includes
provisions for: . _.

    

- Increased administrative costs, both at the County Office and
_service provider level for the development of new programs

, - Costs of case management services '
- Purchase of transportation services
- Insurance - liability and malpractice ' ~“= * ~s~~
- Increased physician services ‘IL. I

P we have also been informed by the Allegheny County Commissioners
that they will not be able to continue to provide thei103“matchnf0$hday-

‘ programs for institutional residents. ,Jhus, DPN must provide l00% of the
budget necessary for the support services for Polk Center residents.

' ~ As we indicated earlier, it has been our impression that the
discussions to date have focused on the development of CLA program for Polk
Center residents. we feel the planning for the continued dispersal of
Allegheny County residents from Folk Center should include residents of the
present dispersal sites (Marcy Habilitation Center, Highland Center, Robin-
son Developmental Center, Allegheny Valley School Cottage). we would like
to work closely with the social service staff at Polk in identifying
residents who might now utilize these sites in Allegheny County opened by
movement into CLA's. These people will then be considered for CLA programs,
in FY 78-79 and later.‘ This assists Polk Center in decreasing thgigicensus
to meet M.A. standards, does not over-tax our communities, provide§’better.
services for the residents, allows them to be closer to their families,, “
and facilitates future predischarge planning. we have concerns that move-
ment from Polk Center directly to the community is_not appropriate for most

Polk Center residents. Given the intensive level of service necessary for
present Polk_Center residents and the constraints on our system's ability
to develop this level of service in a brief time span, we are interested

in discussing both the utilization of present dispersal sites and the.
development of additional resources to accomplish our mutual goals. There
will be a need to recruit, encourage, and screen new providers to develop
community living arrangements. There will also be a need for us to explore
the establishment of additional intermediate care facilities and possibly
private licensed facilities in Allegheny County. Such development will take
significant lead time and funds for start-up costs. These are issues we
need to discuss with you and to explore the possibility of the utilization
of CLA funds for start-up costs for such programs.

Two last points; first, we feel it is primarily Polk Center's
responsibility to provide the parents and residents with an understanding
of this dispersal project and to obtain_théir agreement in writing to ar
transfers. Second, we will want assurances that state—operated facilities

’will be available for three years as "back-up" when needed for any residents‘

who are transferred to a community living arrangement program.

In closing, we support you in this effort and sincerely want to
work closely with you in developing a plan that will help us accomplish
this. This requires a close working relationship between us, and I and my
staff are prepared to work with you to accomplish these mutual goals. Can
we get together with you to work through the issues raised here?

Sincerely,
