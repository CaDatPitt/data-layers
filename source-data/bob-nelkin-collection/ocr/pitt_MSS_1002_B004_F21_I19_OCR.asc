In re: Doctor James H. ucCle1land,Ahis dismissal’
Dear Governor: I

"I deplore most emphatically the firing of Doctor James H.
Mcclelland, superintendent at Polk. . _ "

I am familiar with the reputation of the Doctor. I have
had_numerous occasions to talk to Father John Kirk, Catholic
Chaplain at Polk, doctors and psychiatrists, employees and pa-
tients at this outstanding Pennsylvania Institution and I am
aware of the fact that all of these people invariably have

nothing but the highest of praise for the Superintendent.

They view him as being humane and willing to spend count--
less hours of his own time in the interest of patients and employ-
ees: compassionate but fair in handling the problems of the In-
stitution, and of being diligent in protecting the rights of all
individuals falling within his authority. '

Primarily and most important of all he is universally re~
garded as being a PROFBSSIOMAL. Both by training and experience
he has a reputation of being knowledgeable in advancing the wel-
fare of all people associated with the Hospital.

I also have had numerous occasion to personally observe the
operation at~tho Hospital, having visited and toured the Hospital
and it is apparent on the most casual of observations that the
Hospital is efficiently operating with an over-riding concern for
the health and emotional and mental stability of the patients.

A To summarily dismiss this most competent of public servants
is completely unjust. , ’

« é” This matter must be rosolvsd.by you. To permit this

arbitrary action to stand would be a dis-service to the pa-
tients of the Hospital: unfair to a dedicated professional
and certainly one which would have a vast political reper-

cussion to you.A ‘

Unfortunately thin deplorable egisode has occurred at a

‘time when there are knowledgeable people saying that many;n§u&

your Appointees to prominent Stata positions are below the
caliber required of their positions: that you are showing a
bias and hostility to professionalism and catering to'medioe;,

’crity.or less. ~

Tho instant case does much to validate this accusation.

You are the only one that cnn dispel this belief. I know .
that I expreas the feeling and nentiments of thousands of Erin-
ites whsn I request the immediate reinstatement of this eminent
dogtoro _ , . - .

. tvery truly yours,
