Background:
The meeting was a direct result of a joint ACC/DPW action at
Mountain Top Interim Care Facility for mentally retarded on October 18

l9-and 20 which resulted in the closing of the facility.

Agreement: ACC understands DPW{s concern that the precipitous closing
of interim care facilities may result in the transfere of interim care
residents to State schools and hospitals that are already overcrowded
and where inadequate provision is made for their care and treatment.

Conversely, DPW recognizes that some interim.care facilities have such

a negative effect on residents that transfere of residents to State

schools and hospitals, even if they are of questionable quality, is of

critical importance.

Accordingly, the ACC Board of Directors will continue to visitkthose
interim car‘ facilities where Allegheny County residents are housed
for the express purpose of bringing conditions (good or bad) at the
interim care facilities to the attention of the Office of Mental
Retardation. In the event conditions are found that are detrimental t

the residents, ACC will immediately advise the Office of Mental
Retardation. ‘

"§Z?B§ment -- page 2

based on ACC's information and their own immediate investigation,
the Office of Mental Retardation in consultation with ACC will
make a decision to close the offending facility or attempt to

salvagezit.

In the event a salvage effort is undertaken, the Office of Mental
Retardation will immediately, within.24 hours, move adequate staff
into the facility to provide sufficient technical staff assistance

to improve either/or both plant and program.

At the time of such intervention a contingency plan for removal

residents will be developed in conjunction with the County MH/MR
program where the residents reside. This contingency plan to

include individual evaluation of all residents.

ACC specifically reserves the right to revisit the facility following
DPW intervention to determine if improvement has occurred. In the
event improvement has not occurred, ACC reserves the right to take

unilateral action, including but not limited to notification of the

news media.

It must be emphasized that if this-procedure malfunctions at any
point, ACC will act in a manner determined best for the residents

involved. ' ' . - ,
