The Department’s emphasis dur-
ing the year continued to be the
expansion of opportuni-ty for men-
tally retarded citizens to live and
work in a normal community en-
vironment.

At the same time, residents of
State Schools and Hospitals
(changed by legislation July 1976
to Centers) continued to receive in-
dividual assessment to determine
treatment programs based on in-
dividual needs.

Community Living Arrangements

More than 2,600 persons were
served by the community living
arrangements program during the
year, in group homes, apartments
and other residential environments.
Approximately 54 per cent of the
persons living in these residential
settings were previous residents of
State institutions.

Group homes increased in num-
ber from 103 in 1974-75 to 124 in
1975-76. Apartment living arrange-
ments increased from 239 to 415.
The number of children in family
placement homes in 1975-76 was
85, compared to 53 in the previous
year. Adult family placement in-
creased from 137 last year to 160 in
the past ﬁscal year.

An example of one of the inno-
vative approaches used by the CLA
program during the year is the
Supervised Apartment Project for
non—ambulatory cerebral palsied-
mentally retarded persons in Pitts-
burgh.

Recognizing that these citizens,
because of their multi-handicaps,
were virtually excluded from semi-
independent living arrangements,
the United Cerebral Palsy Associa-
tion initiated the program. To par-
ticipate, a person must be develop-

mentally disabled, 21 or older,
have a motor disability and be eli-
gible for service through the Alle-
gheny County Mental Health/
Mental Retardation program.

Located in a private housing de-
velopment within the City of
Pittsburgh, rental costs are based
on a sliding fee scale according to
each person’s monthly income. The
person signs his or her own lease
with the City Housing Authority.
Under a Federal subsidy law,
qualiﬁed persons can receive up
to 75 per -cent of the rent for public
housing.

Each apartment is adapted with
equipment such as grab bars, ramps
and stairway lifts, to aid the phy-
sically handicapped. During the
day, each individual leaves his or
her apartment for daytime activi-
ties either in a sheltered workshop
or in work training programs.
Started in November 1975, eight
residents are participating in this
unique program.

An outstanding achievement of
the CLA program during the year
has been the continuing develop-
ment of children’s residential pro-
grams which have successfully
demonstrated better program qual-
ity for the handicapped child than
the traditional group home. In the
children’s residential program, em-
phasis is being directed toward
small apartment residential set-tings
with a husband and wife team serv-
ing as house parents for two chil-
dren, usually of varying ages. This
type of program offers better inte-
gration into the neighborhood, the
school and the -communi-ty. It af-
fords a more normal living situa-
tion for the children. Other posi-
tive aspects of the program include
less staff turnover and the ability

11

to initiate a program more rapidly.

This successful program now
numbers over 150 children in 67
apartment settings. This trend will
continue to be further developed _,»
in subsequent years.

An important part of the CLA
program during the year involved
the evaluation and monitoring of
its services. Training was provided
to houseparents and staff members
working with CLA to insure quality
programs. PASS (program analysis
of service systems) evaluations were
performed on eight CLA programs
to assess the quality of each and to
make suggestions for constructure
change where necessary.

A ﬁscal audit format was also
developed in cooperation with the
Auditor General to assist in moni-
toring programs and insuring ac-
countability.

State Centers

The number of residents in the

10 State Centers declined from

GROWTH IN COMMUNITY LIVING ARRANGEMENTSPROGRAM 9,220 in June 1975 to 8,517, as of
June 1976. Staff complement re-
mained relatively stable at 9,965
compared with 9,997 in June 1975.

(Number of Homes and Apartments)

Despite the decline in resident
population, the cost per diem at
the State Centers rose from an
average of $39.50 in ﬁscal 1974-75
to $51.00 last year because of in-
flation and increased employe
beneﬁts.

Emphasis continued to be fo-
cused on individual assessment of
need and the development of in-
dividual treatment plans for each
resident. Under the Goal Planning
Project, a statewide training net-
work was set up to provide instruc-
tion for staff in the techniques of
goal planning. Over the past ﬁve
years, more than 4,800 persons
have completed such training in
Pennsylvania. The development of
goal planning skills is an essential
part of insuring appropriate care
and treatment to residents of both
public and private facilities.

63°ro-owe-nu Training is now being provided

through the Continuing Education

Division of Pennsylvania State Uni-

versity at all 22 regional campuses.

tional material is provided by the
Office of Mental Retardation.

In April 1976, ﬁve workshops
were offered and 176 persons en-
rolled at 17 campuses. Four re-
gional conferences were also held
during the year, involving 240 per-
sons from various facilities serving
mentally retarded people.

Altoona Center, a four—story
modern facility, located in Altoona
was officially opened in November
to serve 138 non-ambulatory, se-
verely and profoundly retarded
citizens.

A complete complement of ser-
vices, ranging from educational
programming to individualized
therapy, is offered at the Center.
Its proximity to health facilities in
Altoona have improved the quality
of care by increasing the availa-
bility of specialized services.

In addition, the Center has ten
beds available for respite services-
temporary residence for a retarded
person who lives with his or her
family for periods when the family
is ex-periencing stress, personal

 

crisis, or needs a vacation.

Accommodations can also be
made for parents of residents who
must travel a long distance thus en-
abling them to visit more fre-
quently.

Those persons served -at the Cen-
ter were transferred from Cresson
Center where antiquated buildings
and architectural barriers limited
the kind of programs and activities
available -to them.

Woodhaven Center, operated
jointly by Temple University and
the Department reached its full
capacity of 300 residents in Novem-
ber 1975. This innovative facility
offers short-term rehabilitative ser-
vice for mentally retarded children
and adults who are emotionally
disturbed, hyperactive, socially
maladjusted or physically handi-
capped. It also serves as a train-
ing facility for personnel in the MR
ﬁeld.

The need for legislation dealing
with admission and commitment
procedures became more urgent
last year as the result of a number

of court decisions.

In the case of Bartley vs. Kre-
mens, in November 1975 the Court
declared Sections 402 and 403 of
the 1966 Mental Health/ Mental
Retardation A-ct unconstitutional
as they pertained to the involun-
tary commitment of juveniles. The
decision has been stayed pending
the outcome of the Common-
wealth’s appeal to the Supreme
Court.

In July 1976, the Court declared
unconstitutional Section 406 of the
1966 Act dealing with the involun-
tary -commitment of adults. The
Goldy vs. Beal decision has also
been stayed pending enactment of
new legislation.

A Mental Retardation Proce-
dures Act was introduced in the
General Assembly and public hear-
ings were held during the year. It
is expected that a revised form of
that legislation will be introduced
in the new session of the Legisla-
ture when it convenes in January.

A task force from the Depart-
ment is assisting in the preparation
of this much-needed legislation.

PLAN NOW FOR THE 1977
PENNSYLVANIA ART SHOW
FOR THE MENTALLY
RETARDED

All art entries will be judged
on the local, community, county
and degional level, during Feb-
ruary and March, 1977. Any
mentally retarded person is eli-
gible to enter this contest.
Winners of these contests will
be exhibited at the State Con-
test at the William Penn Memo-
rial Museum, Harrisburg, be-
ginning April 10. Award recep-
tion for the statewide winners
will be held on April 17.

Mental
  Health

During the Fiscal Year 1975-76,
the Mental Health Program in Penn-
sylvania underwent many signiﬁ-
cant changes with a renewed em-
phasis on treatment within the least
restrictive and most appropriate
setting and on patient rights. Sev-
eral court orders declared sections
of the Mental Health and Mental
Retardation Act of 1966 uncon-
stitutional affecting the voluntary
admission and involuntary com-
mitment procedures.

“System Integration”

On January 30, 1976, the Com-
prehensive Mental Health Planning
Committee submitted to Secretary
Beal its preliminary report, To-
ward Complete System Integra-
tion.‘ The report, representing 18
months of intensive study by rep-
resentatives of more than 30 state-
wide organizations, recommended,
as essential needs, a clearly defined
single point of entry at the com-
munity level to the mental health
treatment system, a uniﬁed budget
system which allows funds to fol-
low the patient, and an assurance
of continuity of care. The Commit-
tee also stressed, among other rec-
ommendations, patient rights, the
provision of humane living condi-
tions for patients unable to reside
independently in the community,
the provision of timely, adequate
and appropriate mental health
services to all citizens of Pennsyl-
vania, and the integration of the
mental health system into a uni-
ﬁed human services delivery sys-
tem.

Education, P. O. Box 2675, Harrisburg,

Act 143

Recognizing the need to revise
commitment procedures, the Gen-
eral Assembly, after holding hear-
ings throughout the State to obtain
recommendations from public and
private agencies and from the citi-
zenry in general, passed S.B. 1025,
which was signed by the Governor
on July 9 as Act 143, The Mental
Health Procedures Act. The effec-
tive date of the Act was September
7, 1976.

The new law establishes pro-
cedures for admission and commit-
ment, providing provisions for
withdrawal from voluntary treat-
ment, for informed consent of a
voluntary patient, for limitation of
involuntary commitment to “clear
danger” criteria, for review of the
involuntary commitment within 72
hours culminating in either dis-
charge, voluntary admission or ex-
tension by the court of the invol-
untary commitment. The law also
requires that a treatment plan be
developed to meet the speciﬁc
needs of the patient. Rights of
patients are assured and enumer-
ated in the Act.

Program Emphasis

In order to more adequately
meet the needs of -the citizens of
Pennsylvania, major emphasis has
been placed on several program
trends. In order to provide ap-
propriate and adequate treatment
and care for the convicted mentally
ill, the Department is addressing
the need for forensic units within
the State mental hospitals for those
persons needing minimum security
only. Such units would be desig-
nated within the four Regions of
the‘ Department, thereby making
them more accessible for patients
within those areas and also making
the eventual transition back into
the community easier for the pa-
tient. The Department is also pur-
suing with the Bureau of Correc-
tions the provision of psychiatric
services to prisoners within the
Correctional system.

Long Term Care Units are being
established at various State mental
hospitals to meet the need for
skilled nursing and intermediate
alternate care for those patients
who no longer need intensive psy-
chiatric treatment but who cannot
be placed in the community in
nursing homes, boarding homes or
other aftercare facilities.

The Department has also ad-
dressed the long recognized gap in
services for the emotionally dis-
turbed child. On June 30 a Chil-
dren’s Psychiatric Treatment Cen-
ter was opened at Mayview State
Hospital. This 40-bed psychiatric
hospital unitfor children ages 4 to
13 will complement community-
based programs in the area and
offers inpatient therapy to children
who need such intensive care and
treatment. The availability of men-
tal health services for children in
the community is being surveyed
and efforts are being made -to pro-
vide such services throughout the
State.

In its efforts to eliminate dupli-
cation of services and to effect a
greater funding accountability,
consolidation of two under-utilized
State mental hospitals (Hollidays-
burg and Somerset) was announced
on June 29. Somerset was chosen as
the site of the consolidated hospi-
tal. An evaluation ofthe patients
at Hollidaysburg will determine
their capability to move elsewhere
and, for those older patients who
cannot be moved, a’ small skilled
nursing unit will be established at
Hollidaysburg State Hospital. The
Hollidaysburg State Hospital, by
legislative action, will be converted
into a veterans nursing home.

By contract, the Department is
also focusing on another pressing
need in the development of a com-
prehensive system of community-
based rehabilitative and support
services for the mentally disabled.
Such services will include the resi-
dential, social, vocational and com-
munity support needs of a popula-
tion of mentally dysfunctional per-
sons, including those awaiting dis-

 

At the same time, more than 175,000 persons are receiving ser-
vices through community mental health-mental retardation programs,
at an estimated cost this year of $76.5 million.

‘ , intervention 8: Training

Under the Mental Health/Mental Retardation Act of 1966, it was envisioned that the development of community services
would supplement the traditional institutional services, thereby creating a comprehensive mental health services delivery system
capable of providing the appropriate response, when and where it was needed. It was expected that the role of the State mental
hospitals would diminish since they would become only one type of service provider among many.

As services developed, however, significant deficiencies have been identiﬁed. The community services have not been
merged with the institutions in terms of funding, patient care programs or emphasis. Many organizational and political barriers
have developed which almost completely stymied the de-emphasis of the institutional component. The result has been an in-
exorable rise in expenditures for institutional care and a lack of necessary funding for community programs.

To correct these deficiencies and achieve the intent of the 1966 legislation, the Department is continuing its mental health
planning efforts through the Comprehensive Planning Committee. Four pilot projects designed to bring together community and
institutional resources are a major part of these efforts.

To facilitate this, it is strongly recommended that the institutional and the community appropriations be combined’ to
enhance the ability of the Department to plan more effectively and to bring about the integrated system so badly needed.

MH/MR

The emphasis in the mental retardation program continues to be the maximum development of every retarded person in
the Commonwealth. Supportive services are designed to enable retarded people to avoid institutionalization and to live as nor-
mally as possible in the community.

Although the vast majority of Pennsylvania's 360,000 retarded citizens do not require the intensive care offered through
institutional programs, for those who do, the Department is emphasizing the development of individual assessment of needs
and personalized treatment programs.

Through the Community Living Arrangements program and expanded community support programs, the number of
residents of State Schools has continued to decrease. This has signiﬁcantly relieved the overcrowding that had existed in some
facilities. In addition, increases in staff authorized during the last ﬁscal year have resulted in a resident-staff ratio of 1 to 1,
increasing the capability to provide the quality care and treatment needed to help each resident reach his potential level of
growth and development.
