Dear Mrs. Elkin

I have just received your intercommunication memo entitled "A Visit to
Polk State School and Hospital", dated March 27, l973. The quality of the
zerox copy, which I received, gave me my first indication of the type of
report that I was about to read. It is, without a doubt, the most vicious
attack that I have witnessed on an institution and its employees and particu-
larly its Superintendent. Since you, yourself, have removed the kid gloves
from this discussion, I will continue in the same vein.

It's obvious from the beginning remarks that you make that you are mis-
trustful of this institution. You challenge Dr. McClelland's trustfulness
in regard to knowing beforehand of your visit. In the fourth paragraph of
your report, you wondered if the single rooms were used as a reward or for
spying on the girls. I think a report, such as you made, should confine
itself to observations and not your own psychological.hang ups. Ybur constant
innuendos betray not so much the inadequacies of this institution as they do
your own. On the second page, under the title of "Food Services", I find
it incongruous that-you mentioned that the girls who were eating did not try
to talk to you. This is a difficult project, to talk while you are eating,
especially, when no one stops to talk to you. Your concern for the welfare
of the retarded was nowhere in evidence on the day of your visitation. In-
stead, there was an attempt to avoid any conversation with the residents,
especially, those with severe physical handicaps. You questioned dining
room attendants as to the service that they were offering, "to help, to watch,
to keep order?" Since you raise a question, permit me to respond. Yes, the
employees were there to help. They are there to watch. They are there to
keep order. That is their job.

Under the title of "Sunnyside", you, again through innuendo, cast GSpwr-
sions about the treatment of the residents in this building. You say "name
had scratches or bruises". Yet, in the same cottage you raised the question
about "large wooden enclosures of wooden slats placed close together and
about 5 feet high". As we explained to you at that time, these enclosures
were used to confine disturbed residents, instead of placing them in a
strait jacket for restraint; it was felt that it is more humane to allow iﬁcn
freedom of movement and at the same time protect other residents from the
bruises and scratches that you have calls; attention to. These enclosures
were designed by Dr. Sidney Kaplan many years ago so that the restraining
jackets would not have to be used.

con't.
