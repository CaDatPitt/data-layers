Secretary of Public Welfare
Harrisburg, PA 17120

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth

It is a regrettable situation when we must dismiss a person for
doing a top level job under very difficult conditions. If the situations
at Polk State School and Hospital are as reported by you in the local
newspaper, it is the direct result of inadequate financial backing of the
controlling officers of our state school system. The lack of sufficient
funding by the legislature has resulted in the over crowding and under-
staffed conditions at Polk and other state institutions, which you give
as reason for dismissing the superintendent.

Any person who works with the retarded would agree that there
are times when it is absolutely necessary to use restraints and other
means to control and protect the patient and those around him. I am.
positive that any such situations as reported after your visit to Polk,
were the result of the need for this kind of action to protect the

_patients at the institution.

I would further have to disagree with this type of direct,
hasty action without some due process in favor of the superintendent and
discussion with the Polk Board of Trustees and other interested persons.
If such a Board of Trustees are to function with any meaning, even if
only in an advisory capacity, I believe their counsel and advice should
be sought out in this kind of situation.

I am awaiting further information, from Mr. Taylor, as indicated
in your telegram, before I make a further decision relative to my associa-
tion with the Polk State School, as a member of it's Board of Trustees.

Sincerely
/ 7 /7
