I write this letter to protest the firing of Dr. James
McClelland, administrator of the Polk State School and
Hospital for Mentally Retarded Children.

As a Dietetic Intern in a program operated by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I served in a number of State
institutions including Polk. More specifically, I worked
as a food service supervisor in one of the patient buildings
at Polk, and I spent a good portion of my time in the patient
wards. ‘ -

One of the many things I learned from my experience at
Polk was that retarded patients occassionally hurt themselves
or other children, inadvertently. One way to prevent injury
would be to provide constant, personal supervision. A more
realistic method of protecting patients, particularly in under-
funded, understaffed institutions,_is to confine the "aggressors"
for short periods. I

I did see "king-sized playpens" (which Secretary Wohgelmuth
called "cages") in use at Polk. However, the structures were
located in the same lounge with the rest of the patients, they
were large enough for the patient to move around comfortably,
and I never saw the pens used for disciplining patients, only
protecting them.

I think Secretary Wohgelmuth acted with unjustifiable haste

T when she concluded that the Polk patients were being treated

inhumanely and that Dr. McClelland condoned cruelty in the
institution.

During my five weeks at Polk, I saw so much warmth and
constructive work that I cannot believe Dr. McClelland either
cruel or incompetent. -
