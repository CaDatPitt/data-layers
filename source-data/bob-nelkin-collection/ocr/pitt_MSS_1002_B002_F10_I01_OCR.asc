Dear Carla:

I have just had an opportunity to read your
October 1st Report to the Court on the Individuals Who
Moved from Pennhurst. The anecdotal reports of individual

. client progress are certainly positive and should serve as

 

a continued incentive to all persons working to develop
community resources. The demographics were interesting
and should be helpful in future planning efforts. I was
most particularly encouraged by the data showing an
increase in family participation following placement of
a client into the community.

I would recommend that for the future, reports
such as this be issued on a regular basis. It may be
useful to incorporate data from monitoring efforts such as
the upcoming community placement audit. ~

I would appreciate it if you would share this
letter with your staff.

Sincerely,k»
