Dear Madam: 9"’ ‘--‘   

£4 W‘ “ -
I am writing regarding the firing of_Dr. Mcclelland
at Polk State school and Hospital.

My sister, Adrienne Tomko, age 40, has been a resident;
of Polk for the last 24 years. She is severly re- F
tarded, not able to speak, and requires constant
supervision. She is allowed to come home for holidays
and summer vacations and appears to look forward to
these visits. However, she is always anxious to re-
turn to Polk after the holiday is over. In all of our
trips to Polk, we have found there is a lot of love
and care shown toward the patients. In spite of the
over-crowding, the institution is immaculate. The
staff does a job that most of us would find appalling-
the care of the retarded is one of the most frustrat-
years of

»-- -nu---.<.-aw .-—.r...... rrrvvv—fIf[- re- .r~..-...ww

her life and we know all the difficulties.

I think the publicity over the so-called "cages" is E
horrible. They were inteded as play-pens for adults
who will always be children. My parents, aged 70,
agree that if it were necessary for their daughter to .
be restrained, a play-pen would be more desirable than;
heavy drugs or strait-jackets. '- '

The persons in this matter who should be investigated
are the law-makers whor allowed the budget cuts re-

_sulting in the over—crowding and understaffing of Polk:

and similar hospitals. Also, I think if you were truly
interested in the welfare of the patients at Polk, 5
Dr. Mcclelland should have been retained until his ,
successor (I hope temporary) had a chance to acclimate

himself to the Job. My parents returned Adrienne to :
Polk after the Easter holiday and spoke to Dr. white f
regarding the Medicare program and he was very honest ;

in admitting that he was "lost" -—the job is too

big to take over at a moment's notice. He is re-
ceiving calls from concerned parents who think their
child may be mistreated or is being moved to another

location. Many patients have aged parents who have ‘
been a peace knowing their child is being cared for
at Polk, you have disrupted all of this.

I have yet to see anything in our local paper, the

 

., Herald, to agree with your thinking in this matter.

‘ 9 Surely, all of us can't be wrong, there are 158 ‘*
' -1 Mercer County residents at Polk and not one has F
;q spoken out against Dr. Hcclelland or Polk. Somehow,

2 many of us feel this a purely political move, and it

,5 is very sad. . E
