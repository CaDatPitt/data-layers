Dear Ginny:

Thank you for bringing to my attention
the very serious conditions at western State
School and Hospital which have resulted in
past accidents and deaths.

It disturbs me that the poor quality of
care provided residents at the institution has
become intolerable, as evidenced in the summary
of case histories which you provided me.

My correspondence to M iltner concerning
the difficulty which Mrs. #had encountered
in placing her son at the 1 1 u ion was for the
purpose of clarifying the background of conditions

which have created an unfavorable climate for
further admissions to western State School.

I sincerely support your continuing efforts
to monitor activities at western State School and
Hospital in the hope of insuring the best possible
care for its residents.

with best wishes,

Irarm personal regards.

ohn Heinz III, M.C.
