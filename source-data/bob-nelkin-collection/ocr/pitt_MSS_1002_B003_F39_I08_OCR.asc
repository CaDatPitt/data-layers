Dear Dr. Scott:

ACC-PARC received a call from a concerned WSSH
parent. The complaint was that the parent is not’
notified when the resident is injured. when the ’
parent visits. neither nurse nor attendant informs.

the parent of the injury.

what is Western State School and Hospital's
policy on the notification of parents when their
son or daughter is injured?

In 1973, a committee consisting of parents
and professionals, appointed by the Regional
Office, composed a Bill of Rights for DPW facili-
ties. Article I. Section F reads:

‘You will be informed as soon as
possible of any illness or accident
that requires the service of a nurse
or doctor. In the event an illness
or accident occurs to your child
you may have your child seen by the
physician of your choice at your
expense."
