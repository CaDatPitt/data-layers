Dear Mr. Baal:

This letter is in regard to the very dire need for a Behavior Msnageesnt
Unit at Southwest Hsbilitetion Center. As you know, this uit hes been requested
since April, 1974.

Recently, due to a behavior problem of some residents, there have been
several disturbing occurrences end a breakdown in the training of our relstives.
As e result, we are now forced to ask for en immediate decision on this letter.
We would hope that it will not take a serious tragedy to bring this unit into
being s

We believe, even with all the "red tape” of government agencies, this
mstter is long overdue for action. we have had a promise several times that
this plan wee epproved, but now we need more than e promise.

our family group meets monthly, and we would like to invite yo to

.ettend our meeting on Sunday, septmber 12, 1976 at 3 p.n. at the lease
