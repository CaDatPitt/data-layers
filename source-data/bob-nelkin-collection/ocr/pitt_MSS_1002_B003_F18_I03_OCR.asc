REPORT ON ARCHITECT'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE
WESTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL
PHASE II - CONSTRUCTION
MEETING

January 22, 1975
7:30 - 11:45 p.m.

COMMITTEE'S PURPOSE:

The purpose of the Committee is to aid the architect to
design buildings to meet accepted program and living standards.
The Committee consists of representatives from the WSSH Board
of Trustees, the WSSH Parents's Group, Allegheny County Chapter,
PARC, the WSSH Superintendent, and the WSSH Assistant Superin-
tendent.

ATTENDANCE:

Lou Doughton - WSSH Board of Trustees

Robert Nelkin - ACC-PARC

Robert Hiltner - WSSH Superintendent

Ruth Lynn Scott - WSSH Assistant Superintendent
Patricia Gishbacher - Western Region DPW

WSSH Staff Members

Norman Frey - Architect contracted by G.S.A.
Bill Yokum - Chief Architect - DPW Construction & Maintenance

Aside from the crucial question about the wisdom of erecting
new buildings on WSSH grounds, there are enough critical questions
about the manner the state is proceeding to halt the building
project. Reasons are outlined here:

(a) Lack of Knowledge

Frey, the architect, responded to the question, "Do you
know much about retarded people", by saying "no". It was apparent
that Frey was not engaged in a self-education program to learn
about multiply handicapped persons. some of Frey's questions
revealed a lack of knowledge of handicapped individuals. Yokum
referred to WSSH's residents as "retards".

(b) No Successful Archetypes

Frey was asked, "What prototypes are you reviewing from
other states?" I guessed from his not answering, that little
research is being done.

Yokum suggested that the Pennhurst layout be sent to
the Comittee to review. Aside from the Pennhurst plan, there
is no reason to believe the architects are researching what
has failed or succeeded in the past.

(c) Resistance to Input

b Frey was repeatedly asked whether he would prepare
rough sketches and concepts to aid the Committee in visualizing
the project. He was not enthusiastic and did not commit him-
self to providing rough sketches.

Frey was asked when the Committee would see his sketches
in the Preliminary Stage. He responded, "one week to ten days
before submission (early March) to Harrisburg."

Regarding input, Yokum stated, "These jobs can get
awfully messed up with too much input. Norman Frey's contract
is only with the General State Authority. The G.S.A. alone,
can grant special permission to deviate from his contract."

(d) The Die is Cast - Rigid Attitude

The response to the request for the presentation of rough
sketches and discussion of concepts was, "We don't approach the
idea that we are going to make changes." /

In regard to some specific changes suggested, Yokum
said, "It's too late now. We must finalize our plans tonight.
We have to draw the line at some point."

Frey said, "They (G.S.A.) consider the approved Scope
as a Bible." Comments on the approved Scope appear here.

(e) The Scope is not Accurate

‘ The Scope approved by G.S.A. and forwarded to the
architect is dated November 14, 1973. The Scope was not re-
vised after revisions, dated November 23, 1973, were suggested
by the Comissioner of Mental Retardation and the Region's
Institutional Representative.

At the time of submission, November 14, 1973, the educa-
tion building was needed to help the IU #1 comply with the Right
to Education Consent Agreement. IU #1 appropriately now has
plans to educate most of the residents in community schools.

At the December 12, 1974 Liaison Comittee Meeting, the WSSH
Assistant Superintendent estimated 30 individuals would not go
to community schools for medical reasons. This drastic change
is not accounted for in the G.S.A. approved Scope.

The institutional population may change considerably
making the Scope and proposed buildings obsolete. Current plans
include the transfer of 100 residents to the Park Nursing Home
in Pittsburgh. Right to Education and Community Living Arrange-
ments’ effect on the type of residents left at WSSH is undeter-
mined. These building plans are aimed at a moving target and
cannot be successful.

Hiltner said that the central office cut the original
Scope without consulting Western's administrative or program
staff. I gather that WSSH staff intend to live with these
random cuts so that the project is not delayed. '

As late as Yokum said it was in the time table, many
changes were still being proposed at this meeting. Hiltner
said in his opening remarks that some of the changing factors
were shift in philosophy of the IU #1, increasing degree of
handicaps of Western residents, and the fact that more than 1/2
of the school-aged residents will be older than school-age by
the time the building is completed. Some of the suggested
changes in the Scope were the best estimates of persons present,
but were not supported by any data or research.

(f) No Documentation for the Scope or Space Requirements

The Scope only generally refers to the uses of these
Phase II buildings. Many questions remain unanswered.

" Space Requirements may be accurately proposed by WSSH
program staff, but no reasons accompany the Scope. Because no
justifications are available and the eventual uses are vague,
it is impossible for the Comittee and probably the architect
to evaluate the accuracy of the space estimates.

Members of the Committee requested documentation from
the brain-storming sessions that led to these specifications.
Hiltner stated that notes or minutes were not kept of the brain-
storming sessions leading to the proposed Scope.

It's also difficult to determine whether the individual
needs of program departments.have been coordinated in this
ll/14/73 Scope.

(g) Limited by State and Federal Regulations

When asked about innovative materials, Frey said
their use was not probable. "I am limited to the materials
listed by the Department of Property and Supplies."

Yokum said that even though sprinklers are not his
choice for the best fire safety devices, they are the ones
that will be installed as a result of Federal codes.

Frey was not even aware of the state and federal program
regulations that he would have to comply with. There were no
references to attempts to comply with JCAH, AC/FMR standards.

Yokum told the Committee a couple of times that he
does not like to plan buildings based on current theories,
because theories come and go. He cited the trend away from
"normalization". "The trends won't be the same when this
building is completed." one of the Committee members surmised
that if this was his attitude, he would probably use 15 to
20 year old drawings as models. Infact, the architects talked
of reviving some of Frey's 1966 drawings for this project.
Yokum said they would be good, but "bigger than needed".

(h) Proposed use is Limited in Flexibility

The architects predicted that innovative ideas would
be shot down when the Life Safety Code is applied. one member
of the Comittee expressed that the severely handicapped indi-
viduals are doomed in Cedar and Pine Lodges by this design.
The severely handicapped individuals‘ living areas will not
improve via Phase II. This was seen as a definite deficiency.

(i) The Pennhurst Debacle

Yokum referred to Pennhurst as a plan not to repeat.
"Pennhurst is a nightmare." "We can't even pin down the blame
for this disaster." "I don't like to think about it." "Two
million dollars worth of garbage." He told of various problems
like light switches in the showers. However, he promised to
send the Pennhurst layout as a prototype to follow at WSSH!

Members of the Committee expressed extreme concern
that Pennhurst not be repeated at WSSH and doubt whether the
state could build a decent Phase II.

(3) Air-conditioningye Not this year

At the December 12th Liaison Meeting, the Comittee
was informed by Hiltner that the electrical renovations might
be completed by this summer, but there were some difficulties.
Yokum, at this meeting. informed the Comittee that the electri-
cal work may not be completed until late in the summer of 1976 ,
because of problems obtaining transformers. Yokum said there
could be air-conditioning on the lodges if WSSH used a system
called "shedding". He suggested the laundry should work at
night, etc. Members of the Liaison Committee have heard
promises about the air-conditioning for a number of years.
ACC-PARC has written a couple of letters requesting help from
Deputy Secretary Meyers, but has never received a response.

The delay in air-conditioning at WSSH is a splendid example of
the incompetency of the DPW.
