RE: Halderman v. Pennhurst
No. 74-1345

Dear Judge Broderick:

As you know, the Commonwealth defendants have
initiated discussions seeking to negotiate an agreed schedule
and format for full implementation of this Court's Order of
March 17, 1978. Dr. Jennifer Howse and our attorneys met
with the other parties throughout last week in that effort.
Dr. Howse presented the Department's proposal which, based
upon her experience, she considered a responsible blueprint
for delivering quality community services on a realistic
schedule. '

It was my hope that such an agreement could be
reached, thereby eliminating the need for Supreme Court
review. Unfortunately, those efforts have proved unsuccess-
ful to date. fAccordingly, with the Governor's approval, I
will file a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari before the
March 12 deadline.

The filing of a Petition does not alter my goal of
substituting agreement for further litigation. Nor will it
alter our commitment and effort to promote the full development
of the community service system, consistent with this Court's
orders. To this end Dr. Howse, for the Department, will be
presenting during the first part of April for the Court's
consideration a proposed implementation order on the course

to be followed. 1 hope that this proposed order will have
the full support of plaintiffs and county defendants; we
will continue negotiations to that end. Absent agreement,

however, I am imploring the Court to hear our proposal and
to give it the prompt and full attention which I believe it
deserves.

Sincerely,
