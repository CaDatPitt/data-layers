Re: James H. McClelland, M.D.
Superintendent
Polk State School and Hospital
Polk‘ _
Pennsylvania

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth,

In the Wednesday, April 18, 1973.edition of The

Evening Chronicle, Allentown, Pennsylvania, I read an article
with the caption as follows; "Patient Cage Draws Firing Of
Doctor." I am enclosing a copy of this article for your
perusal. In the Thursday, April 19, 1975 edition of The
Morning Call, Allentown, Pennsylvania, I read an article with

“the caption "Three Polk Playpen Patients Stage Unprovoked

Outbursts." A copy of this is also enclosed for your perusal.

I have known Dr. James H. McClelland for approximately
twenty three years. I had the distinct privilege of being a
"Summer Intern" under Dr. McClelland at Polk State School
during the summers of 1954 and 1955. I am now in the private
practice of medicine in The Lehigh Valley where I have been
since July 1958. Having been in practice for fifteen years I
have met and been associated with a large number of physicians.
I can honestly say that I have never had the privilege of

-knowing a more compassionate and concerned physician than

Dr. McClelland. It is obvious that noone can be correct all
the time, but I suspect Dr. McClelland has been wrong many
times less than myself and many of my colleagues. It is with‘
this in mind that I write you concerning these articles and
the situation which prevoked the writing thereof.

— I strongly protest your action of dismissal of
Dr. Mcclelland from his duties and strongly encourage you to
reconsider the action which you have taken. It is rather

~ obvious after reading these two articles, if they are in the

least correct, that you have very little knowledge of the
care of mentally retarded, especially those who become
agitated. I am utterly appalled to think that you would
fire a man of Dr. McClelland's ability, especially after his
long tenure of handling this type of patient.

_ I would like to further inform you that I am an
extremely dis-satisfied tax paying citizen, especially when I
read quotes such as those attributed to you at a news
conference following this dismissal. I quote from the article
of Thursday, April 19, 1973, Morning Call, Allentown,
Pennsylvania; "The rally was pretty much what we anticipated.
He's been there a long time." This seems to be a rather
juvenile response on your part. I would anticipate that any-
one who'has "been there a long time" would have at least as
many, if not more enemies than friends if he were not doing an
extremely adequate job. This obviously is not the case with
Dr. Mcclelland, as his friends, I am sure far outnumber his
enemies. Respect, certainly must be earned, not demanded. I
respect Dr. McClelland. I am angered by Helene Wohlgemuth.

I sincerely hope, Mrs. Wohlgemuth, that you will
respond to my concerns as voiced in this letter.

incerely, . c ‘ .
I &‘fI/‘I-*4--°
