Welfare Secretarvllelene W0 hl gei-
muth's abrupt dismissal of Dr.
James McClelland as superinten-
dent of Polk State School was
reprehensible -and smacks of
something cooked up in a Star
Chamber proceedings. At the very
least. his nearly 30 years of
dedicated service at the institution
warranted somewhat more con-
sideration than summarily to be
handed his hat and shown the

, door.

Except for having incurred the

enmity of some powerful interests.
Dr. McCl_elland. in our opinion. has

one nothing either to deserve
such treatment or to be dismissed.
One wonders how the ‘Common-
wealth hopes to attract and keep

‘people of his caliber in these

difficult and demanding jobs with
such a policy.

‘ Secretarywohlgemuth's‘explana-
tion that she ordered the dismissal
because of Dr.‘ McClelland's
failure to ac: promptly in elim-
inating the use of so-called re-

walternative. At

work at
Wohlgemuth could find no argu- 
with supporters on this L‘

straining cages is less than con-  ‘

vincing. The cages in reality are .

oversize playpens commonly used if? , _ 
for infants but in this case for .  

older individuals who unfortunate- '

ly in many cases are little more f '

than infants mentally.

The alternative to the devices to ’
prevent such patients from doing ‘

injury either to themselves or to
others is the straitjaeket. and this
hardly _ seems an acceptable
_ ‘ that’, ‘Dr.
McClelland never made any effort
to conceal the devices and when
ordered by the Secretary to
abandon their use promptly did so.

Dr. McClelland has announced
that he intends to appeal his firing
to the state Civil Service Com-
mission. and we believe he should.
His history of dedication to his
Polk (even

merit

Mrs. -

score) is such that to permit this 

unfair and unjustified ‘stain upon
his record to remain would be

‘tragic.
