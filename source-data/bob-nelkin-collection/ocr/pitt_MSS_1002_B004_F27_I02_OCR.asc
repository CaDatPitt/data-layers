‘ THREE NJNTKS OF ?ROCRES$ AT PCLK STATE SCHOGL & HOSPITAL
The bars are off the windows, and the door stands open in

Cottage 1 at Polk State School. Three months after the controversial

April 17 dismissal of the Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospi—

tel, Dr. James Mcclelland, Polk, outwardly hasn't changed much. Inside’
the large office with roll top desk, hoever, a flurry of activity during
the past three months has generated a quiet excitement at the Institution.
"I am quite enthused with the cooperation and wil1ingness.to develop some
new program direction at Polk State School on the part of many staff."
Joseph Colombatto, Acting Superintendent, said recently.

Polk, three months later, is not the same place. It never will
be. The enthusiasm which Mr. Colombatto has referred to has generated
excitement for: '

...Forty-six staff members who have volunteered to take

part in 5 projected experimental program on the Polk

grounds. Called a Placement Readiness program, this

innovation will allow those residents with potential

for community placement an opportunity to learn and

test their skills in a somewhat independent environ-

ment. Existing staff apartment housing will be used

as residences for the young women. A series of plan-

ning sessions have been held to date to develop this

program.

...A committee consisting of top level staff, child care
side staff members and residents at Polk has been

appointed to analyze and compile all rules and policies

   H

existing at Polk, both written and unwrittenu This 3
Policy and Rule Review Committee has been formulated
in order-to develop a consistent policy for both

residents and staff which is fully understood by all.

...The Cottage 1 program. initiated in late April, is now

totally open. The use of confinement calls, dry scrubs

and punishment techniques has been abolished. The staff

is involved in developing individual programming for I
each resident, and group recreation, work, and training
programs are now a part of the every day routine. Attempts
are being made to provide an individual program for each
resident in this cottage, with specific goals for each

resident in mind.

...A Keferrsl and Placement Team developed with County
Vents} Health/Rental Retardation programs in the l4—
county area served by Polk, as well as private agencies
such as the Easter Seal Society, United Cerebral
Palsy, etc., will hold meetings every Tuesday at Polk,
with these county organizations, during which all
referrsls for services to the mentally retarded in the
area will be discussed. Each referral will be discussed
and evaluated in terms of how Polk might provide ser-
vices through staff evaluations, etc.. in the community,
and how communities might better serve the retarded in
their areas.- This Referral and Placement Team, developed

after a series of meetings between Mr. Colombatto and

- 3 -

Polk staff, Mu/HR Directors from eight northwestern

counties, and service agencies.

...A Parent-Staff Association has been organized at
Polk State School and Hospital, by parents, with the

support of the administration.

...In cooperation with the Venango County Action Program,
an effort is being made to generate funding to attempt
to develop a Foster Grandparent Program at Polk. The

initial planning allows for 75 to 80 Foster Grandparents.

...Plans for the first Bar Hitzvah at Polk State School
.and Hospital in the fall are beins cowpleted. Bar
Mitzvah preparations are underway now for Jewish resi-
dents, ”Although it does not sound very significant,”
Colomhatto stated, “It has a tremendous impact on

attitude for the families of these residents, and for

the staff that has worked with them.”

...C1nrion State College and Polk have developed a pilot
program which will begin in August on the campus of
Clarion State College. Fifteen residents from Polk

and fifteen retarded residents from communities in

the area will live in a dormitory on the Clarion
College campus for three weeks during August. Several
staif members from Folk, Clarion College staff, and ‘
graduate students from Clarion State will serve as
housenarents, counsellors. and instructors duriné this

period. This experimental program was developed,

fv

sponsored, and funded jointly by the Venanszo County 
Mn/KR Office, Polk and Clarion. "We're going to take

a look at it,” Wr. Colombatto said. "Perhaps it can

turn into a permanent program. It's being done in

other states. ;This pilot program can show us where we

need to go in terms of program, staff end all the

other 'bugs' that need to be ironed out before a good

ongoing program can be developed.”

Pointing to what she termed "heartening bepinnings," State
Secretary of Public welfare, Hrs. Helene wohlgemuth outlined a goal-
epecific vocational training program which is in the process of being
developed at Polk and will be implemented within the next~tvoVEb‘three
weeks. "Even with the existing problems at Polk, progress in the form of
programs for residents who formerly had very little in the way of indi~
vidual programming is under way. A vocational program nhich emphasizes p _,

the native abilities of severely retarded persons is a beginning. The
increased involvement of local communities is a bopinning. The formu-
lation of a parents group is a beginning. The devlcopment of an
attitude that these residents can be stimulated, can be helped, can be
worked with is a beginning, and the ending will be 1 more humane and
socially responsible approach to the education and care of mentally
retarded residents at Polk," she said.

Another problem at Polk, staff to patient ratio, has also been
an area of constructive action. without an increase in complement, 61
Child Care Aides have been hired, an additional ton Full-time Registered
Nurses were recruited. Pediatric Residents from Childrens Hospital in

Pittsburgh have been recruited through the western Regional Office of

O -5..
0

3h .D’partment of Public Welfare to do physical examinations on Polk
re3!dcnts. with the assistance of a Nursinp Consultant from Pittsburgh,
an attempt is being made to develop better nursing coverage through the
daylight and evening hours within every residential unit utilizing
existing staff. By September, additional special edﬁcation teachers will
insure the implementation ofkthe Right to Education at Polk. Through the
cooperation of the Intermediate Unit, all residents between the ages of

5 through 21, regardless of the severity of their handicap, will receive
the benefit of an educational progran at the Institution geared to their
specific needs.

"There are no longer cages or playpens at Polk. That option

to control behavior no longer exists, so other options have to be developed,
tried. Yes, it's hard on the staff, but this is a staff that is willing,
hard workinz, and cooperative. In the verv near future, a proeram will be
developed utilizing our Psychiatric Consultants. This ‘Behavior Clinic‘
will he developed, with the participation of staff, to provide programs

and techniques specifically designed to eliminate severe negative behavior.
Each resident with a severe behavior problem will be examined by the
Psychiatric Consultants, and his problems and behavior discussed with
personnel who work with the patient on the wards. This kind of ‘what-to~
do’ approach, where staff can discuss problems with an expert should go a
long way toward eliminating the need for restraints, drugs, or isolation
as an approach to a person with behavior problems,7 said Mr. Colombatto.A

There are no more bars on the windows of Cottage 1 at Polk.

Brihhtly—colored red couches now brighten the day room at the cottage, and

through the open doors, staff members from the education department, social

service department, recreation department enter and leave with residents

are a drcat many talented staff at Polk," Joseph Colombatto recently
reported, Vwith many exciting ideas which will bﬁ utilized. I am extremely
optimistic that the progress made at Polk during the past seven weeks will
’d.

continue to develop and make Polk a very relevant institution within the

total framework of mental retardation services within this region."
