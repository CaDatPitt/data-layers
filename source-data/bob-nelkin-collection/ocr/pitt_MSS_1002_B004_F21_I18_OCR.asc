In re: Doctor James H. Mcclelland, his dismissal

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:

I vehemently deplore your uncouth and vulgar manner in
summarily discharging Doctor James H. Mcclelland, a con-
scientious and dedicated public servant.

_ As stated by letter to the Governor of this date I am
perfectly familiar with the unquestioned professional repu-
tation and actual accomplishments of the Superintendent of
Polk. I am curious as to your qualifications and motives.
I am sure that this episode will shed some light on this
matter.

If this episode is characteristic, God help the Welfare
Department.‘

The stated reason for your action is so absurd as not
to justify a retort.

I suspect your motives to be political. To fire a man
for political reasons is understandable but to conceal that
reason under this personal attack on his competency, particu-
larly after he has been in his official capacity under both
the Republican and Democratic Administrations in Harrisburg

would be rotten.

I have never heard of such barbaric and anti-Christian
conduct to a man of such eminent stature as occurred in this
case. You have done a dis-service to Polk, to the Superintendent

....nInnVIA ... .

and of significance, to your Employer, the Governor.

I am perfectly well aware that there are several hundred
Erieites who are patients at Polk. I know many of their par-
ents and relatives and I know that these people have nothing
but the highest of praise, admiration and respect for the doctor.

.I know that if this indefensible action is not rescinded
it shall have disastrous political consequences to the Governor
and as an active Democrat, interested in advancing the Democratic
Party within the State, I consider this action a calamity for my
Party. '
