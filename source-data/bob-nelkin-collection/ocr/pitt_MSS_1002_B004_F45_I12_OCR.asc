Fire Deaths

Faulty sprinklersatid detec-
tion equipment have been

blamed by a local“-group for g
the mentally retarded in the »

deaths of two residents in a

fire at Cresson State School

Hospital in Cambria County.
“Cresson is no-t even in com-

pliance with their own fire’

and safety regu'larti—ons,” Said
Mrs..Barbara Sistik, a board
member of the Allegheny
County Chapter  °the"_PenI1-
sylvania Association for Re-
tarded Children (PARC).

Mrs. Sistik, the mother of a

 

mentally retarded child, and
Robert Nelkin, staff member
of the local PARC group, vis-
ited the state school and hos-
pital following the deaths
Thursday of Carl Dodara, 21,
of Harrisburg, and John Lytle,
30, of Clearfield County.
Two Residents Died

The two mentally retarded
residents, died of smoke inha-
lation injthe fire, which was
confined to ‘a’ dormitory wing
housing 150 patients.

Another resident, Alex
Streppa, 21, son of Mr. and
Mrs. Alex Streppa of 1011
Chartiers Ave., West End, is
listed in critical condition in
Altoo-na Hospital.

Following an inspection of
the state school -and hospital,
Nelkin and Mrs. Sistik yester-
day criticized state legislators
for failing to pass House Bill
2637, which would have pro-
vided sprinklers and detection

equipment at. facility.

“We must wonder if these
two deaths could have been
averted if Cresson had re-
Celved the $625,000 requested
i-n the legislation and had in-
stalled this equipment,” Mrs.
Sistik said.

Lauds Staff Members

She said it is “fortunate that
the entire wing d-idn’t become
an absolute inferno. It is
frightening to think of what
might have happened with
less alert, dedicated, efficient
staff members on duty.”

Meanwhile, Dr. Norman W.
Mulgrave, local PARC presi-
dent said his group would
launch an intensive effort to
have fire and safety compli-
ance records of Pennsylva-
nia’s nine state schools and
hospitals and interim caré fa-
cilities investigated.

“What if this happened at
Polk or any of the huge, old,
overcrowded, understaffed fa-
cilities? How could a handful
of staff evacuate hundreds of
non-ambulatory residents from
buildings with wall-to-wall
beds and insufficient fire es-
cape routes?” he said.

0ffice- Upset

Will H. Burrow, superintend-
ent of Cresson, was unavail-
able for comment although
his office said he was visibly
upset about questions sur-
rounding the deaths.

Fire and safety codes are
established by the Pennsyl-

vania Department of Labor

and Industry.
