Secretary of Public Welfare Helene Wohlgemuth announced a series of actions
designed to improve the quality of care and rehabilitation at Polk State School and
Hospital. Mrs. Wohlgemuth in a letter to the parents of children at the institution
said: "In the midst of all the controversy, my primary concern continues to be the
well-being of your child at Polk."

In moves which will translate that concern into action, the Secretary announced
several steps she has taken. First, a group of seven nationally known experts in
modern programing for the mentally retarded are visiting Polk today. The experts
are viewing programs at the facility and/grovide observations and an evaluation based
on their own experiences.

Mrs. Wohlgemuth said: "I am pleased we could call on the advice of people such
as Alan Menefee, Director of the President's Committee on Mental Retardation,

Phillip Roos, Executive Director of the National Association for Retarded Children and
others to provide help in improving programs at Polk."

The seven member team in addition to Roos and Menefee includes:

Dr. Marvin Kivitz
Elwyn Institute

Mr. Albert Meuli
National Association of Superintendents of Public Residences Facilities
for the Mentally Retarded

Mr. Gene Patterson
National Association for Retarded Children, Residential Committee

PROGRAM REVIEW STARTS AT EASTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL AND FOUR OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Secretary of Public Welfare Helene Wohlgemuth today announced that an in-depth
review of policies, programs and procedures at Department institutions will begin
Monday, May 21, at Eastern State School and Hospital, Trevose, Bucks County, and
expand to four other facilities May 29.
"It is the intention of the Shapp Administration to effect changes in our
institutions to assure the highest quality of care possible for the residents," Mrs.

l,{1
E

Wohlgemuth stated.

"Since their creation, state institutions have operated as independent, autonomous
entities.

"As each institution is visited, the review teams will identify program and

administrative deficiencies. The deficiencies will form the basis for setting time
T-—

1iﬁ§€éa”§3ais for corrective action. The goals will include specific plans to improve
—-__#____......_._.. _____m____ V,  .,_l.- 

a given situation and methods by which those goals can be reached.

"After the review team; ;;v; finished the initial phase, departmental personnel
will monitor progress at each institution. The monitoring will include the measurement
of change to meet the originally specified goals. After-hour and night visitations
will be an integral part of the monitoring phase.

"This methodology will not only assure improvements in patient care but also

enhance the Department's ability to establish and measure each institution's ability

to provide quality.care," Secretary Wohlgemuth said.

Dear Mrs. Elkin

I have just received your intercommunication memo entitled "A Visit to
Polk State School and Hospital", dated March 27, l973. The quality of the
zerox copy, which I received, gave me my first indication of the type of
report that I was about to read. It is, without a doubt, the most vicious
attack that I have witnessed on an institution and its employees and particu-
larly its Superintendent. Since you, yourself, have removed the kid gloves
from this discussion, I will continue in the same vein.

It's obvious from the beginning remarks that you make that you are mis-
trustful of this institution. You challenge Dr. McClelland's trustfulness
in regard to knowing beforehand of your visit. In the fourth paragraph of
your report, you wondered if the single rooms were used as a reward or for
spying on the girls. I think a report, such as you made, should confine
itself to observations and not your own psychological.hang ups. Ybur constant
innuendos betray not so much the inadequacies of this institution as they do
your own. On the second page, under the title of "Food Services", I find
it incongruous that-you mentioned that the girls who were eating did not try
to talk to you. This is a difficult project, to talk while you are eating,
especially, when no one stops to talk to you. Your concern for the welfare
of the retarded was nowhere in evidence on the day of your visitation. In-
stead, there was an attempt to avoid any conversation with the residents,
especially, those with severe physical handicaps. You questioned dining
room attendants as to the service that they were offering, "to help, to watch,
to keep order?" Since you raise a question, permit me to respond. Yes, the
employees were there to help. They are there to watch. They are there to
keep order. That is their job.

Under the title of "Sunnyside", you, again through innuendo, cast GSpwr-
sions about the treatment of the residents in this building. You say "name
had scratches or bruises". Yet, in the same cottage you raised the question
about "large wooden enclosures of wooden slats placed close together and
about 5 feet high". As we explained to you at that time, these enclosures
were used to confine disturbed residents, instead of placing them in a
strait jacket for restraint; it was felt that it is more humane to allow iﬁcn
freedom of movement and at the same time protect other residents from the
bruises and scratches that you have calls; attention to. These enclosures
were designed by Dr. Sidney Kaplan many years ago so that the restraining
jackets would not have to be used.

con't.

Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Ms. Uohlgemuth,

I am a Special Education teacher and have a severely retarded daughter
living at Polk State School. Therefore, I feel more than oualified to

express my great distress caused by your recent firing of Dr. James McClelland,

‘superintendent of Polk State School.

. ,. .-uJ.a~£.Lu-7 div»-..'.'...aI'L3n‘b‘ ‘ . «bud»; om. .- ...s......¢:i.§—',.«..~‘ -v-Q4...’ .,..z.>¢.v..« . - r—-» ~«-- aw "‘-G-¢’i:-4dIIua.uu2'r:222«.£;.-an!-"1b‘»n

Your abrupt action indicates to me that you have very little intimate
knowledge of severely and profoundly retarded children and adults. There are
individuals who require close supervision and partial confinement in a play-
penulike enclosure For their safety and the safety of others. This is not
cruel and inhumane, it is sensible action taken For safety. Some of the
children and adults do reouire rather heavy medication at various times be-
cause of severely aggressive behavior.

It is my opinion, and the opinion of various proFessiona1'oersons that I
have discussed this matter with, that partial confinement used in conjunction
with some medication is far preferable, more humane, and more sensib1e.course
of action. ‘This gives aides and teachers the opportunity to work with and try
to help the residents.

Play pens are used by many parents of young children to keep them safe
and not isolated. Many residents of Polk are still very young children
though they are physically mature.

My daughter is and has been receiving excellent care at Polk. Dr.
Mcﬁlelland is responsible For a fine program of high quality care For all the
patients in his care. I.do not understand how you can possibly charge him
with inhumane treatment. He could not possibly have held his pgsition at‘
Polk as administrator for so long a time or be so highly respected by his
employees, parents of patients, professionals is his field,-and many other
DBUDIB, if your charges were true.

I believe that you have made a very serious error in judgement. It is
my sincere wish that you reconsider this extremely serious decision and re-
instate Dr. McClelland at Polk so that he can continue to administer a pro-
gram which is progressive, thoughtful, and has great concern for the welfare
and best interests of its residents.

Dear Ms Wohlgemuth,

I am.writing in protest of your recent publicity seeking and uncalled for

action in the firing of Dr. James H. Mcclelland as Superintendent and Adminis-_
trator of the Polk State School and Hospital. As a former pastor in Franklin,
Pa. and a regular visitor at the Polk State School, I was able to see first
hand the accomplishments which Dr. McClelland brought abbut during the years
he gave of himself at Polk. Now as a member of the Board of Directors of the
Westmoreland County Association for Retarded Children, it grieves me deeply
to see the spiteful action you have have taken against Dr. McClelland,perhaps
.at the instigation of our own state association officers.

It is quite plain that you have taken this unjust action, without the benefit
of a hearing, in order to remove some of the criticism that has been placed on
your office for past failures and neglect of your responsibilities concerning

. the retarded children and adults of our state.
I urge you to reconsider your hasty action in the firing of Dr. Mcclelland.

The Honorable Helene Wohlgemuth
Secretary of Public Welfare

333 Health & Welfare Building
Harrisburg, PA 17120

Dear Secretary Wohlgemuth:

The Harrisburg Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has often
been critical of the Department of Public Welfare on matters of the rights of
patients within mental institutions and we have not hesitated to critize the
absence of action we considered necessary. Often, I fear, we have failed to
commend officials who have taken action to insure the constitutional rights
and the human dignity of patients.

‘Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to commend you for ordering
the dismantling of dehumanizing cages which have been used routinely in con-
trolling the mentally retarded.

News reports that the Department--whatever that term refers to--was

aware of the presence of these cages seems to me quite hollow. I am impressed
by the fact that once you as a responsible official saw these for yourself that
you spontaneously and immediately ordered their dismantling and moved to change
the personnel who had not only tolerated but exploited the presence of these
uncivilized devices.

Our Chapter's Patients Rights Task Force continues to have serious ob-
jections to Harrisburg State Hospital's policies that abridge the freedom of
patients, and we will be in touch with you about these matters over the coming
weeks, but your action with respect to Polk State School gives heart to all of
us working to insure a dignified existence for patients confined to state hospitals.

Re: Firing of Supt. McClelland

Dear Secretary Wohlgemuth:

As you know, our organization is involved in active day-to-day work with
mental patients in the Philadelphia area and at Haverford State Hospital.
We are most concerned about assuring that institutional conditions and
-administrators support the welfare and rights of patients.

Because of our concern, we wish to express total support for your decision

' to order the dismantling of the "cages/pens" at the Polk institution and
the firing of its superintendent. We feel that this action was most
consistent with your duties as Secretary gf Public Welfare. We hope that,
_despite the criticism of you from some quarters, you will remain steadfast
in your resolve to end this and other inhumane practices in state schools and
hospitals. -

If we can be of any assistance to you in this area, please do not hesitate
to contact us.

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:

ml _
K.‘

I am writing to you regarding your courageous actions in
dealing with the most primitive conditions at Polk State School and
Hospital. ’ ~

I have been employed as a coordinator in The Right to Education
Office for one year. As part of my professional duties, I work with
the intermediate units in which Selinsgrove, Laurelton, White Haven
and Polk are located. On many occasions, I have.visited all of these
facilities. During these visits I was very impressed with what I saw,
with the exception of Polk. It bewildered me to see such lackadaisical
and crude treatment of patients. I could not understand why the other
facilities I visited are able to do so much more with the same types
of residents. Certainly there must be more to it than the newness of

the physical plant or the ability level of the residents.

The change of attitudes and actions will certainly be necessary
if Polk is to achieve the same high standards of the other facilities
which I have visited. Through your brave actions, this change has begun.

,May I applaud you for your willingness to cause a turnabout in what so

often seems to be a never-ending, self—perpetuating situation. Xou
were courageous enough to take a stand and to fight to improve a most
inhumane treatment of those who cannot fight for themselves.

Very truly yours,

Dear ﬁrs. Wohlgemuth;

I
The parents of the residents of Folk State School
are not Worrieg; they are angry.
What the tarents, most of the employees and post
of the residents want is for Dr. Mcclelland to be
reinstated and we will not really be’satisfiod
with any other arrangement.

It is beyond me how anvoge could have so much
authority as to FIRE someone without an investi~
gation. I have suggested to Governor Shapp that
you be obliged to wear a straiqht ﬁacket for one
day and work one week in the worst division of the
school before you pass judgment. c

When I brought my son home for Easter, he had a
cut and swollen lip and jaw and no one knew how it
had happened. He is unable to tell anyone then
someone hurts him and there are so many to match,
it is absolutely necessary that the violent ones
be restrained some way and the cages sound ruch
more pleasant than a room in which the person can't
even.see the others or be near them; also better
than restraining belts and jackets etc.
The real fault is§with»our unrealistic society
that forces existence on those poor creatures who

The Hon. Milton J. Shapp
Governor _
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
State Capitol

Harrisburg, Pa. 17120

Dear Governor Shapp:

We are aware of the situation which has developed recently at Polk
State School,and it was discussed by our Executive Comittee yesterday.
Without commenting at all about the process by which this situation was

- handled by the Department of Public Welfare, we want to express our complete

agreement with the view that restraints such as the pens and cages used at
Polk are incompatible with modern and humane treatment methods and should
be forbidden at all institutions for the mentally disabled.

There is no evidence whatever that mentally disabled persons are more
inclined toward assaultive or violent behavior than are any other persons
or groups.

Furthermore, we think that the use of such restraints illustrates the
need for continuing public awareness and for action with respect to the
conditions in Pennsylvania's institutions.

Staff must be attuned to humane treatment and to the primary goal of
strengthening the individual patient's capacity to reenter society. A
custodial or "warehouse" approach is not acceptable.

PMH is categorically opposed to inhumane methods of care and to the
concept of permanent institutionalization of people. We urge you to ensure
that all institutional treatment be mandated to further the patient's earliest
release to a community facility and to support much needed development of
community services. ‘

Our major efforts are toward replacement of institutions by local
facilities or integrating them into comunity—based programs. So long as
institutions do exist we will not abandon our concern that humane and appropriate
care be afforded those who still remain within their walls. ‘

My dear Governor:

The Pennsylvania Medical Society urges you to call for a
study funded through the legislature to bring together a num-
ber of now uncoordinated studies of the Mental Health/Mental
Retardation Program in Pennsylvania as a step toward a single,
thorough, objective evaluation of the entire situation. Our
Society pledges its cooperation in such an effort.

The state administration and legislature should partici-
pate in, but not dominate, a general investigation led by a
national figure with an unquestioned reputation for objectivity.
As additional participants we suggest representatives of the
general public, private mental health and mental retardation
groups and leading professionals in the mental health/mental
retardation fields. -

The information currently available to us indicates
that Dr. James H. Mcclelland, the former superintendent of
Polk State Hospital, is a victim of the state's difficulty in
establishing and administering practical uniform guidelines
with adequate funding in the mental health/mental retardation
area. In addition, the emotionalism surrounding the dismissal
of Dr. Mcclelland tends to obscure the real issue -- the
quality of all of the care and services provided by the state

(continued)

The Honorable Milton J. Shapp . May 8, 1973
Governor of Pennsylvania Page 2

to the mentally ill and mentally retarded. The general investi-
gation we recommend should be authorized promptly under auspices
that would avoid any political stigma. Political or personality
issues dare not be involved in anything so serious as assessing
the quality of care and services provided to the retarded and
mentally ill.

The issue is not the use of restraining enclosures for those
patients whose periodic violence to themselves and to others can-
not be controlled adequately by drugs. The real issue is the
total quality of care the state provides and this needs to be
impartially assessed and made public so that facts and not
emotionalism will be the basis for action.

The general study we recommend is sorely needed and we call
upon State Government to authorize it as promptly as possible.
We pledge our support for such a move and our willingness to parti-
cipate in it.

Sincerely yours,

Robert S. Sanford,.

Dear Ms. Wohlgemuth: _ $429”

(_/W

I read with great interest the brief articleAabout the situation
at Polk State School and your action in firing the superintendent.
There is of course more to the story than the article describes,
but having been involved in working both with retarded children
and with so—ca1led delinquent children in Indiana and in Dela~
ware, I have learned how to read a bit between the lines.

Secretary of Welfare, Helene Wohlgemuth
Harrisburg, Penna. -

To the uninitiated, the idea of putting people in "pens" is
horrifying. After working with such people, however, I came

to the conclusion that if they were properly used such de-

vices were far and away the most humane, for all concerned.

If your child was assaulted by an‘ungovernable peer in such

an institution, you would want the ungovernable child restrained.
If your child was so destructive, you would hope that he could
be retrained...and filling the child full of tranquillizers,
isolating him entirely from others, or physically punishing him
just doesn't retrain him properly.

I don't know Dr. Mcclelland, but it is certainly rare for both
staff and patients to express such regard for the person at
the top of an institution of this sort. It is a thankless
job, at best. I saw many idealistic programs start, and fade
away due to lack of money, understanding, cooperation, unity
of staff purpose, education, etc. This in turn made many
very good people quit in despair...everyone needs to see the
results of their labors in some way, and when you deal with
the retarded, you do not get thanks from them, as you might
if you were a medical doctor who cured you of a painful ail-
ment.

It was my conclusion that both restraint and retraining were
equally needed in such institutions; But you can get surprises.
In one institution for delinquents that I worked in, an "iso-
lation cell" was kept as a "last resort" for inmates who failed
to cooperate and appreciate the relatively open program. Within
two weeks of opening the facility, we had to create two more of
these cells because the boys begged to go in them to protect
them from the more aggressive inmates who assaulted and raped
the new boys as they arrived if they refused to "cooperate" and,
"submit" to their demands! So you have to really understand‘the
situation before you jump to conclusions. An institution is NOT
like an open society, and it never can be. ' '

With best wishes for your success. I'm sure you are deeply
dedicated to improving a sad situation. Sincerely,

- r’ '7 .
