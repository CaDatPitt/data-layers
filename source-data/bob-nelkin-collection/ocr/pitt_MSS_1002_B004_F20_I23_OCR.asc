Dear hrs. wohlgemuth:

we were shocked to hear of the dismissal of Dr. James
Mcclelland. we feel that this action was unjustified.and made on
face 'vaJ.ue.only. Thirty-two years of service ended by C-W0 hours
of superficial observation is incredibly absurd and unfair.

,These allegedly "cruel, degrading, and inhumane conditions" 9
for which Ir. KcClelland was-abruptly dische"ged are necessary safe-
guards for the welfare of the patients. Perhaps you would prefer
complete restraint of the patients instead of the so-called "cages".

:P.A.R.C. officials also commented on the "baggage carts” used to trans—

port residents through the complex. Perhaps they would recommend in-
mobility.

Emt the fact is, they didn't recommend anything. The only
solution was firing Dr. Mbclelland. we fail to see the rationale of
this action. Even if these alleged problems do exist, one man cannot
be blamed. '

_ We-protest this dismissal and feel this blatant politicking
on the part of the P.A.R.C. is inexcusable.

Sincerely,

" I ~ 7 zw
