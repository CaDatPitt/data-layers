Civil Libertarian Selection Committee
Greater Pittsburgh ACLU

Dear Marjorie, Tom, and Tony,

I oppose the naming of Governor Milton Shapp as ACLU Civil
Libertarian of the year. I recognize how the Governor's vetoes
of abortions, pornography, and death penalty legislation could lead
you to this selection. You could even add to your list of supporting
reasons, Shapp's firing of Polk's Superintendent Dr. James McCe1land
for allowing retarded citizens to be kept in animal cages. However,

the Governor's responsibility and authority extends far beyond mere
negative activity (i.e., vetoes, firings).

During the Governor's first term, the life conditions and treat-
ment of institutionalized, mentally retarded citizens have not sig-
nificantly improved. More important, for our purposes, institutionalized
retarded citizens suffer from the disregard of their First, Fifth, Sixth,
Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Some examples from
the months of August, September, and October include:

The teenage boy who fled from his unsupervised unit and drowned
in the Western State School and Hospital's reservoir.

The severely retarded teenage girl who was critically injured and

â€˜ paralyzed from a beating on an unsupervised unit at Western State School

and Hospital.

The young woman who strangled on her restraint dress while tied to
a special restraint chair at Polk State School and Hospital.

A sampling of other degrading conditions is stated here. 470 indi-
viduals are restrained at Polk State School and Hospital. Medical care
is often not adequately provided. Individuals do not receive rehabilita-
tion training. Residents sleep in bedrooms with 100 other individuals
with no more than an inch or two between beds. Privacy is non-existent.
