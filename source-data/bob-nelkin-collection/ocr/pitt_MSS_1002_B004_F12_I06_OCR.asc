?Dear’Sir:.

ﬁMany thanks for writing. We really appreciate hearing
§from_our listeners, especially when they're involved
jand concerned about an issue that's been discussed on‘
"the Open Mike Program.

wYou_have my total sympathy in your problem and I fully
Qagreejthere should be some sort of easy and efficient
3way of communication between patients and families,
‘especially since society has seen fit to shove Polk
*School and Hospital so far out of town and out of sight.

‘Please,.sir, don't drop the ball. May I suggest you
""contact the governor, personally, as well as the Secre-
,gvtary of Welfare.- I believe you will find Mr. Shapp in-
’$formed, sympathetic and kind.

_i§I have taken the liberty of forwarding your communication
’ ’to_the local chapter of Pennsylvania Association for

-‘ Retarded Children, asking them to press the regional
»gdeputy of welfare for help.

‘Good luck and.....
