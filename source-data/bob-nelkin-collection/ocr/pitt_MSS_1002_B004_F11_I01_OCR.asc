Dear Bob:

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the
recent meeting at Polk State School. Even though the
participants are not preparing formal reports, there
are a few informal observations and comments I would
like to make. Although I have visited Polk on two
previous occasions, you must bear in mind that these
comments are based on rather limited direct observa-
tions of the current situation at Polk State School.

The thing which seemed most obvious during our visit
was an immediate and c;i:;gal_n§gd_:Q establish appro-
priate goals for this fagility, Obviously the estab-
lishment of goals will include regular individual
assessment and individual program plans for every
resident. A random review of records would seem to
justify the charge that Polk State School is a "cus-
todial place".

The second major observation is one which has become
apparent to everyone - the need for more effective
delegation of administrative authority. While the line
of authority from the Commissioner of Mental Retardation
seems fractured and ineffective in terms of his direct
responsibility for institutional programs, the admin-
istration within the institution is rigid and unrespons-
ive to individuals. The cumbersome bureaucratic nature
of the present system seems to prevent a rapid response
to program needs. There is no doubt in my mind that a
cross—disciplinary approach to program development is
essential, but such a team approach could not function
without greater delegation of administrative authority.

I was alarmed by the fact that members of the direct-

care staff seemed totally ignorant of the "off-ward"
activities in which residents participated. In both
educational and therapeutic programs it is essential
that the staff members who spend the greatest amount
of time with residents understand how to reinforce
and implement these other programs. If the living-
unit personnel are ignorant of the other activities,
as they appear to be, it is evidence that they are
not included in the planning process.

At this point it is useless to consider the question
of low staff/resident ratios since that is only used
as justification for continuing the status quo.
Individualized program plans are essential for a
legitimate justification to increase the number of
staff. I will not comment at length here on the
obvious need to disperse a major portion of the
resident population at Polk; you are already alert
to that need. It would be of enormous benefit to
the school and to the Department of Public Welfare
for the institution to immediately begin the self—?
ud hase of the AC/FMR Accreditation process.

The results of that study, Wltn UL’WTfhUUt‘3'TUTlOW-
up site visit by the accreditation survey team,
would provide very specific information regarding
areas which require change.

The third major point I wish to make relates to the
total institutional situation. My observations of
many different institutions have resulted in the firm
conviction that the prevailing value system must be
confronted before appropriate programs can be imple-
mented. The staff at Polk evidenced very little
conceptual awareness of any need for change or
understandings of why developmental programs are
necessary.

It is apparent that the initial step necessitates

a firm philosophical and programmatic commitment by
top administration to a developmental model of
service delivery. To be effective this commitment
must come from the Department of Public Welfare in
Harriburg as well as from the superintendent's
office at Polk State School. The commitment must
be written in simple behavioral terms and then
distributed to the entire staff, to parents and to
the community. A simplistic commitment "to go forth

and do good" is hardly what I have in mind. The
statement needs to be one which firmly presents the
Commonwealth's philosophy and position regarding
services for its mentally retarded citizens who may
require residential programs for some greater or
lesser period during their lives.

When a formal written commitment has been made (one
which can be understood by everyone) then the overall
goals for Polk, or any other institution, can be
easily written. The next step is to institute a
staff development program designed to transform some
basic attitudes of staff members about themselves,
their peers and especially those attitudes which
govern their interactions with the mentally retarded
residents. '

Unfortunately, the majority of Inservice Training
programs have focused upon task-oriented skills
which were either irrelevant to the developmental
needs of the population being served or were in open

conflict with the institution's prevalent value
system. During the past six years I have given
special attention to the way in which Inservice
Training projects have functioned and it is impressive
to note the general failure of these projectsto

secure long term changes in the delivery of program
services. ‘

In my opinion most'staff training programs have
centered upon two major strategies which are doomed
to failure since they are antagonistic to the basic
nature of human development. The first of these
can be labeled Curative_§trateqies. '

The historical evolution of institutional management
explains in many ways why so much energy and resources
have been placed in efforts to cure or ameliorate
developmental disabilities through medical inter-
vention. The magical expectations centered on the
various therapies and the heavy reliance upon drugs
has, over time, resulted in awesome frustrations and
a predictable sense of helplessness among both pro-
fessionals and direct care personnel. While one
cannot question either the ongoing need for appro—
priate medical intervention or for necessary hygiene,

Page 4

these efforts frequently result in little more than
‘knuﬂ;§Q§g_§ani§g;inn" if the personnel view the
situation as developmentally hopeless. It is this
atmosphere of hopelessness and the overwhelming
sense of impotence which causes program failure.__£

reprints of those artigles.

\

The second staff training approach has been a focus
upon Control-Oriented Strategies. It can be hypothe-
sized that the general sense of hopelessness has,

in part, been responsible for teaching personnel to
use controlling strategies on what they perceive to
be a deviant and de-valued population. Most control
strategies inevitably degenerate into highly punitive
responses in the long run. The reason for the long
term program failure is related to the fact that
these control strategies are unnatural and develop-
mentally inappropriate.

A constructive approach to staff development is
essential if we are to break the institutional
stereotype. The traditional inservice educator,
has, unfortunately, been rather ignorant of the
principles of adult education. Adults cannot be
successfully taught by the traditional techniques
of pedagogy and it is high time we recognized the
limitations we place upon staff training when we
ignore this fact. The Department needs to invest
its concern in providing a sound approach to staff
development.

It appears that the situation at Polk State School
is an opportunity for the Department of Public
Welfare to take immediate constructive action to
assure future program success. The institution is
currently undergoing a confrontational crisis and
is therefore more subject to change at this point
than it will be after the crisis has passed. The
literature of crisis intervention should serve you
well at this point. Hopefully the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania will use this unique opportunity
wisely. .
