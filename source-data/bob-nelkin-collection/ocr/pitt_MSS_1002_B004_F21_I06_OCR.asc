Dear Secretary wohlgemuth:

I have been intermitently associated with Dr. J. H. Mcclelland in

various capacities since I960. Many time I have taken students on tour
of Polk and several other similar institutions in the state. In past
years, I have periodically undertaken research (with parental and
institutional approval) from time to time at Polk and at several other
State facilities. Please believe my statement that Dr. McClelland is the
kindest, most dedicated, and most competent administrator whom I have
met in this or many other states in which I have undertaken research or
visited on a consultation basis.

As you have pursued your active schedule following appointment by Governor
Shapp, I have most often strongly supported many of your efforts. However,
in this situation, I feel that you have erred grossly. Probably as the
resultant of horribly distorted information.

I urge you to carefully review the basis of your action and re-evaluate
the conditions which prompted your dismissal of Dr. Mcclelland.

. Respectfully yours,

   
   
  
 

I. J. Howard Turner
V'rofessor of Biostatistics (Human Genetics)
and Associate Professor of Obstetrics

and Gynecology (Medical Genetics)
