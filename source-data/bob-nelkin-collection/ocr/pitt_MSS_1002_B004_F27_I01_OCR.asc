rules and policy for the institution. Many custos, such as girls not being
permitted to ride bicycles; boys and girls not permitted to hold hands; and
girls prohibited to visit the canteen alone, have longlbeen regarded by staff

a policy which focuses on the rights of patients, the rights of parents, and

the needs of staff.
