Dear Mr,;Ee ers:'

Thank you for responding to our request for information about the
status of the dollars required to continue day program services for Polk
residents currently housed at Allegheny Valley Senior School.‘

_ You must be aware that your message is quite troublesome to us. As
I understood our arrangement, Department of Public Welfare/Office of Mental

Retardation was to move $50.00 per week per resident from institutional funds
to the Allegheny County Program in order to permit us the resources needed to
arrange for day program. The news that these dollars will not be forthcoming
creates many problems. The long range problem is one of trust. We agreed to
act as a fiduciary in the provision of these services because we see the need

to reinforce the principle that dollars follow people, and because we had (and

have) a sincere desire to do those things we can to improve the grossly inad-
equate_conditions at Polk State School and Hospital. If those who are respon-
sible for providing these dollars are now beginning to waffle on the deal, it
can only be that they don't recognize the value of the type of arrangement we
have worked out. Out intention was to assist in the Polk Dispersal Project.

   

.1’. 

As a first principle, it needs to be clearly understood that the Polk residents

at Allegheny Valley School are the complete fiscal responsibility of the Polk
budget. There can be no misunderstanding about this!

You know that the Allegheny County Association for Retarded Citizens

went to great pains to relocate an entire program in order to serve these Polk

residents. They did this with the clear understanding, mutually arrived at,
that the dollars needed to provide this service would continue to flow.

The Allegheny County Mental Health/Mental Retardation Program does
not have the dollars to continue this program in the absence of our previously
agreed upon fiduciary arrangement. when these dollars dry up, the program
dries up. This action will represent a breach of faith with this office and
and with PARC. It will work an undo hardship on PARC and in all probability,
be disastrous for Polk residents at Allegheny Valley School.

The problem takes

i on an absurd context when one considers that it will probably cost the Polki
budget more to staff day program activities at Allegheny Valley School than
the current program costs, without the benefit of community exposure.

A corollary issue is that of day program for the Marcy population.
I understand that your internal approval process is such that it took from
September 1974 through December 13, 1974 to get approval to move the dollars
required to mount this program. You understand that there was no way we could
move on substantive issues with any service provider until the dollars were
identified. Hence, your desired start—up date of January 1, 1975 became un-
obtainable. As you know, considerable negotiation is required to start a
service. The PARC experience around Polk/Allegheny Valley School attests to
this. With the news that the State is apparently not living up to the terms
of our previous agreement, continued effort in establishing the Marcy day pro-
gram becomes even more problematic. Given the current track record around this"
type of collaborative program, we now need to question the morality of encour-
aging another provider to mount a program of some magnitude in the face of dis-
appearing dollars. ‘

I-believe we have demonstrated our interest in the deinstitutional—

ization goals of the Office of Mental Retardation. We cannot be a party to a
process that returns people to programless communities. We will not be a party
to a replication of the California and New York experiences. We believe that
people do not need to wander off into oblivion if proper programmatic arrange-
ments can be made. This human disaster can be prevented only through the pro-
vision of resources and the development of new ways of doing business. The
beauty of the Polk Dispersal Plan was that it recognized and addressed both of
these needs. It pains me to see this concept die.

Without some very strong assurances from your office, we cannot pro-
ceed with Marcy day programming. In the_absence of the re-instatement of the
Polk/Allegheny Valley School Day Program dollars, I suggest you begin to plan
"now for program for this population.

Sincerely,

ALLEGHENY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH’
AND MENTAL RETARDATION PROGRAM
