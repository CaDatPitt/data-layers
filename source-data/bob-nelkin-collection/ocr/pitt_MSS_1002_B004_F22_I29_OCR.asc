Madam:

This letter is being written in protest to your recent
action concerning the dismissal of Dr. James Mcclelland
as superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital. It
is also a protest of so-called reasons cited by you,
"the cruel, degrading, and inhumane conditions." '

It is amazing to me that in a brief two hour visit you
were able to make a sweeping judgment of an institution
caring for two thousand eight hundred residents and
employing one thousand eight hundred persons. The visit
was obviously a token gesture to appease the PARC and
the officials whose credentials to judge institutions
for the retarded have yet to be revealed. The enclosed
article reflects my feelings about the woman who is

»obviously "running the show" at the Department of welfare.

The action taken by you was not aimed at helping the
residents; it was merely an appeasement——one man became
a scapegoat. Unfortunately you chose someone who has
spent his life trying to meet the needs of the retarded
and who is highly respected by residents, employees, and
those in the field¢ﬁ‘mental retardation.

It is disgusting to me as a woman that you as a woman in
position of authority should render such an outrageous and
ludicrous decision based on twisted_facts and half_trutns.

I have made many visits to the institution and was aware

of many inadequacies as are present in all aspects of

human society. I was also aware though of the obvious efforts

and strides made by Dr. Mcclelland and his staff in

 

.improving the institution. It is disgustiong that you

did not even take time to observe Polk and its programs
and at least send a gualified, impartial committee to
observe and make positive, definite recommendations for
improvement. V

In closing I must say that I can not believe you had the
nerve to base your decisioncn>the report of a woman whose
judgment is highly questioned and a brief two hour tour
by yourself. This is not a democracy when truly good
people can be defamed by those who twist the facts for

"" *' VF'b‘Y‘l". —..,——. .v«. _ v«.- ~,.«n= Ax“ ~.  ..-,-.. 1! .  ~‘~"*  ' - --rt  . '“‘'‘*'‘'‘*‘""'*''*''-*z-n=r‘'‘'~’~‘*¢''°*‘'‘ ~~« -

what they feel to be some high purpose. It is unfortunate

 

i ii‘. that they (PARC) are so busy " burning witches" that the
'{ » ' real welfare of the retaraaihas been forgotten.

j I would strongly suggest you revoke your "irrevocable"
