Dear Dr. Atwater:
Thank you for your letter of May l9, l98l.

, Since your organization meets regularly with Dr. Jennifer

Howse, Deputy Secretary for Mental Retardation, I do not feel the

need to follow your suggestions to meet regularly with PARC. However,
we will be calling a meeting of interested and affected groups on
zoning legislation and‘will be happy to include you. In the Fall, we
will be setting budget priorities for T982-83 and will hold a meeting
with interested groups as we did last year; once again, PARC will be
invited. .

May I remind you that the Department welcomes constructive
citizen review of its programs and has worked with the ARCS to effect
this review. we do not condone, however, unannounced citizen visita-
tions to private providers of mental retardation services, when those
visits are not welcomed by the providers. It is then that monitoring
becomes trespassing.

I suggest that you Contact the Office of Mental Retardation
directly with regard to planning for community services. The planning
requirements and review of county plans are handled by that office.

Your views on the ARC's support to date of the Department's
effort do not coincide with mine. In fact, your views of the ARC's
activities in the Pennhurst litigation,of the Department's progress in
developing community alternatives and of your characterization of my
remarks before the appropriation committees are classic delusionary and
Self-serving exercises. They deserve no further comment.

P. 0. Box 2575, Harrisburg, PA mzo

Dr. Howse is avai1ab1e to work with the ARC to develop an
agenda, if you feel that an occasiona1 meeting with the ARC leader-
ship would be he1pfu1.

Sincereiy,
