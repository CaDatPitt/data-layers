nenere. "

It was felt that our agony in ire concern for the emotional health of family
life aunt protest the manner in which this entire incident has been handled.
We appreciate the need to provide adequate care and supervision for the
retarded to protect their rights. The issue here though is the rash. unpro-
feeeionel ad unethical -manner in.vhich Dr._Hcclellend wee deprived of his
rights.

we are requesting that your office call for an immediate investigation of
all the facts and that this be carried out by professionals in the field of
nental retardation. This should not be done by emotional individuals with
vested interests endlor biased attitudes about mental retardation.

we are ensuring your office will take a definite stand to protect the rights
