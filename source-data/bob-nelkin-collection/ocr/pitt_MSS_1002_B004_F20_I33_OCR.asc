Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth,

_ Reading this article in the Washington Post this
morning was not a very pleasant way to begin the day,
but to me it offered a ray of hope. Finally, it seems,
someone cares enough to investigate and improve
Pennsylvania's institutions for the mentally retarded.

I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. My brother
is 23 years old and afflicted with Down's Syndrome. He
lives at home and attends a sheltered workshop. Ever
since I can remember our family has revolved around trying
to make conditions better for the mentally retarded.

I graduated from Penn State University in the field of
mental retardation and taught educable and trainable
"mentally retarded children in Maryland until my own baby
arrived. I have continued in graduate work at George
Washington University. My parents are just as involved
in their own way - so you see the problems of the state
institutions have been a continuing nightmare for us

for many years.

I realize there are some bright spots in the Penna.
institutional set-up and this offers hope. But the most
hope of all came this morning when I read that someone
is finally DOING something about the negative conditions:

Thank you!
Sincerely,

anet L. Seale_
(Mrs. James R.)
