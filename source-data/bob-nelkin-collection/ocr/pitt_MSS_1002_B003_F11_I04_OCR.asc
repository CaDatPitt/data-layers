According to our rec r contacts with Northern
Communities MH/MR, Paul is 22 years old, B.D.
2~23-53, severely retarde , ; e to walk without support,

uses a wheelchair, is able to feed.hﬁnself, needs help with
dressing and bathing, described as having no behavior probn
lems and functioning well with peers. He has alwavs resided
at home with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. George who
currently reside at 1300 Giffort Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15212.
He also has attended the Smithfield Street School for several
years.

  
  
  

Paul was placed on waiting list 5-l6~73.
Records inoica e at family was not seeking admission at
that time, but applied for the waiting list in the event
admission was needed at some time in the future when they
were no longer able to care for their son at home.

On 3-5-75, the Social Service department received a
call from Northern Communities MR/MR inquiring about the
possib' it‘ of admitting Paul. Reportedly, Paul's mother,
Mrs. had recently broken her leg when Paul acci-
dent y e on her. It is expected to be approximately 8
months before Mrs. _recuperates. Both the family
and Northern Communities feel that residential care is needed
for Paul in the meantime.

After conferring with Dr. Scott, Northern Communities was

advised that due to overcrowded conditions, WSSH could not
agree to an admission.
