Phone: 322-6008 _ IMMEDIATE RELEASE

The Commonwealth's Department of Public Welfare today was simultan-
eously praised and condemned by the Allegheny County Chapter of the Penn-
sylvania Association for Retarded Children. ACC's statement came in
response to reports that DPW intended to use hospitals for the mentally
ill to house mentally retarded in emergency situations.

Norman Mulgrave, President of the local organization, said, "We must
in fairness commend DPW for recognizing that conditions in many private
interim care facilities are even below the minimum standards existing in

state institutions such as Polk and western State School and Hospital. we

must commend them for trying to alleviate these conditions in the private
facilities. A major objective of this organization has been to have the
Department come to just such a recognition.“

"HOWEVER, ACC WILL ONLY ACCEPT THIS PLACEMENT OF MENTALLY RETARDED
CITIZENS IN MENTAL HOSPITALS IF THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM THOSE WHO ARE MEN-
TALLY ILL AND IF STAFF, TRAINED IN THE CARE AND EDUCATION OF MENTALLY
RETARDED PERSONS, IS IMMEDIATELY ACQUIRED."

ACC was generally credited following the alleged murder of Louis Novak,
retarded youth of Sharpsburg, at Ridgeview Center in August for taking the
lead in calling for improvement in state schools and hospitals and interim
care facilities. Last month, the local group was instrumental in forcing
the closing of Mountaintop interim care facility in Luzerne County.

Mulgrave added, "The fairest thins we can say about the Department's sol-
ution to the problem of interim care, placing the mentally retarded in state
mental hospitals, is that it is totally inadequate. In doing this, they are

talking about beds, not about programs or people."

Mrs. Virginia Thornburgh, Chairman of the local group's investigating
team, hit even harder at DPW. She said, "We have been told that the placing of
mentally retarded at state mental hospitals is only a temporary interim sol-
ution to a crisis. Over a decade ago, interim care facilities were opened
as a temporary solution. They're still open and many are still substandard."

There are fifty-seven interim care facilities in the state. The
facilities are used to house mentally retarded until an opening occurs at
a state school and hospital. There are both private non—profit and profit-
making. Recently, in public testimony, the local ARC alleged that some of the
profit-making facilities make a net of about $2,000 annually for each resident.
The rate for a resident ranges from $11 to $15 a day.

Mrs. Barbara Sistik, also a member of the local group's and DPW's
inspection team, said, "If, as we have been told, only life-threatening con-
ditions warrant the closing of an interim care facility and if, even when
that happens, the Department's best response is to mix mentally retarded
children with the mentally ill, without trained staff or programs, is to

totally admit the bankruptcy of our system of care for the mentally disabled."

Historically, associations for retarded children have gone to great

lengths to differentiate between mentally retarded and mentally ill. Gov-
ernor Milton Shapp obviously recognized this distinction in October when he
established a special Office of Mental Retardation, with its own Deputy

Secretary, with the Department of Welfare.
