Dear Nick,
we hear that the state-ordered freeze on

position filling is seriously affecting the care
of residents at Polk.

if this is true, we would appreciate re-
ceiving intormation that would help make this
point with state officials in the executive
or legislative branches.

I would appreciate hearing from you as soon
as possible.

Sincerely,

Robert Nelkln
