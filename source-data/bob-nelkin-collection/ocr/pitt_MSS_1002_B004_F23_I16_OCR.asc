Fmm ‘Phi: Patriot wire Service:
~ - Welfare Secretary Helen
Wohlegemuth yesterday issued

V;~a directive prohibiting cages

' for people in state institutions.

. The directive came soon af-
ter Welfare Department offl-
cials acknowledged that they

—‘ knew such cages were in use at
Polk State School and Hospital

_- f or retarded persons six
"months before the superinten-
dent was fired» last week.

.- _ “The use of locked cages or

i‘ pens for the incarceration of

; residents is expressly prohibit-

; ed,” Mrs._Wohlgemuth said.

 She said her office was to be

3 informed immediately of any

3 violations.

3 ' Meanwhile, Edward Gold-

‘, man, director of the depart-

; ment's office of mental retar-

" dation, said he learned of the
_caging at Polk last November.
.But a halt was not ordered un-
:til Dr. James Mcclelland, su-

_. -perintendent, was fired.

"; Goldman said he spent the

‘ past six months gathering evi-
‘-dence that would give the de-

._ partment grounds for dis-

' missing McCl_elland. '

_ The results of that in-
vestigation are being kept con-
fidential because McClelland

' has asked the Civil Service

q'Commission for a hearing to
appeal the dismissal.

Goldman said because of the
complexities of the civil ser-
vice system and the politics of

would stick.”

State Hospital Inmate
’ii‘Caging’ Is. Prohibited

Welfare Secretary Helene
Wohlgemuth, who released
news of the caging after vis.
iting the hospital last week,
said simply ordering the in-
stitution to stop using the cages
would have been futile.

She said the hospital’s staff
was concerned more with re-
stricting patients than rehabili-
tating them and would have
turned to other methods, such
as straight jackets and drugs.

Dynamite Scare

Proves Groundless  

The installation of sewer
lines in Hampden Twp. almost
became an “explosive" issue
yesterday, when a Camp Hill
contractor found wires six feet
below ground leading to what
‘he believed to be sticks of
dynamite.

Contractors for Arthur R.
Nagle Construction Co., in-
stalling sewer lines in property
owned by a Hampden Twp.
resident, found the wires while
digging a trench, and imme-
diately called a demolition
team from the Letterkenny
Army Unit.

The unit was joined by S. W.
Arnolds of the Division of
Mines, Quarries and Ex-

plosives ol‘ the state Depart-
ment of Environmental Re-
sources, who ‘ lnitally deter-
mined that the wires were still
a-ctive.

According to officials of the
construction company, experts
twice tried to detonate what
they thought was dynamite left
there a year ago by a company
that installed the sewer’s main
trunk line, but were unsucces-
ful in their attempts.

After digging deeper into the
trench, experts discovered that
the dynamite had already been
exploded but that the wires had
crossed. causing the incorrect
“active” reading on the ex-
plosives gauge.
