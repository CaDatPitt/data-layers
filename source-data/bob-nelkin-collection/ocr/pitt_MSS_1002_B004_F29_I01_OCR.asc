re:

Dear Mr. Appel:

 

At the January 7, 1976 hearing regarding Michael . you
reported to the Court that no placements have become avai able
for him though numerous applications have been sent out to various
group homes and institutions. Michael has been in shelter,
according to our records, for approximately six months. It was my
understanding at the hearing that one of the difficulties in placing
Michael was that testing» has indicated he has a low I.Q. Conse-
guently, I contacted Mr. Robert Nelkin, Associate Executive Director

or the Allegheny County Chapter of P.A.R.C. He informed me, after
I explained Michael's situation, that Michael might be a good candi-
date for a foster home. Referrals could be made to Child Welfare
Services foster home program or possibly to Family and Children's
foster home program. ‘

In view of the length of time that Michael has been in McIntyre
Shelter and the unlikely probability that he will be accepted by
a private agency, I think that the possibility of a foster home
placement should be explored thoroughly. If I can be of any assis-
tance, please do not hesitate to give me a call.

Very truly yours,

ERIC N. ANDERSON
Attorney at Law
