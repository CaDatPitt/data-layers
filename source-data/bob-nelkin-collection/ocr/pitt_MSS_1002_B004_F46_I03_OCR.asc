The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate
the dental program at Ebensburg Center. Three
major areas will be examined. These include equip-
ment and facilities, the actual delivery of dental
services and the number of dental staff and their

C

qualifications.

NARRATIVE

Dr. John Brisini, a general dentist, is in
He is a graduate of western Reserve Dental School and has been at

Ebensburg Center since 1957. Between l957 and l972, he was employed
on a part-time basis. For the last six years, he has been employed
full-time and presently works five days a week, from 7:00 AM until
2:00 PM. Dr. Brisini withdrew from organized dentistry in l970.
Dr. Brisini admits to having no formal training in dental school in
the care of the mentally retarded/multi-handicapped. The last
continuing education course he attended was in l976 in Hershey,
Pennsylvania, sponsored by Temple University. However, this was
essentially a General Dentistry Course. According to Dr. Brisini, the
last course he attended related to the care for the mentally retarded

was at the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in l972.

Dr. Brisini is the only dentist employed at the center which has
approximately 830 residents. There are no part-time dentists at the

center, nor are there any dentists contracted by the center for special

charge of the dental program.

dental services. There are no dental assistants employed at Ebensburg
Center. Dr. Brisini reports that the last assistant quit approximately
two years ago. when asked if her position was ever filled, Dr. Brisini
responded that they (I assumed this to be the administrators of the
center) knew it was vacant. when asked if he requested that her
vacancy be posted, he said he did not and that he quit making requests
about two years ago. There is no dental hygienist at Ebensburg

Center. The last one quit in June of l978, after working one month.

The dental clinic is a one room facility on the ground floor of
Building #l. The clinic has one dental chair, one desk, two cabinets,
a sink, and an x-ray machine. The size of this facility is grossly
inadequate. There are no suctionitacilities in the dental clinic
other than the aspirators, which are a part of the dental unit.

while there is an x-ray machine, which is fixed to the floor and may
not be capable of taking radiographs on residents in wheel chairs,
there are no facilities in the institution to develop the radiographs.
Dr. Brisini stated that he last requested developing facilities about
l0 years ago. There is a Cavitron in the clinic; however, at the time
of this survey it was broken and had been for about one year. ‘_‘
Dr. Brisini stated that he made his last request to have the Cavitron
hose repaired two to three months ago. There is no high speed handpiece

in the dental clinic. Dr. Brisini stated he last requested one in

l967. There is a portable slow speed handpiece, which is taken to

the wards for prophys and restorative work. For the 830 residents
there were seven mouth mirrors and six explorers in the drawers of

the cabinet.

The next area of questioning was related to patient management and
treatment adjuncts and modifications. Dr. Brisini stated that he
does not use wrist, leg, or chest straps as restraints. when asked
if he was familiar with the Papoose Board, he said he had seen it in
the literature, but not in operation. For sedation, Dr. Brisini
uses either Atarax or Pentobarbital. He stated he uses one grain
Pentobarbital as a standard dose for those residents requiring
sedation. He characterizes the responses of the residents and his
ability to perform the necessary work on them as very successful.
There are no nitrous oxide-oxygen facilities in the clinic. Dr.
Brisini reports using local anesthesia for restorations and extractions;
however, he does not use aspiratinq syringes. Four of the thirteen
unopened cans of local anesthesia in stock were expired in November

l977.

Dr. Brisini stated that he examines every resident for recall at

six month intervals, but that only 20-30% receive a prophylaxis.

He reported using Nu Pro prophy paste or just pumice or pumice with
metaphen for the prophys. when asked if he applied topical fluoride,

he said, "no" and that he never had. when asked if he was aware of

1

Page 4

recent reports in the dental literature telling of the adverse

effects of a prophy without a subsequent application of fluoride,

he responded negatively. when told this information was documented,
he replied a lot of that doesn't mean anything.

For those residents who needed restorative work, Dr. Brisini stated
that the time delay between the diagnosis of a carious lesion and the _
provision of the actual restorative work was a couple of weeks.

It should be pointed out at this time that this examiner checked

many residents who had carious lesions which were not treated. These
residents were seen for an exam by Dr. Brisini anywhere from one to
twelve months prior to the day of this evaluation. Dr. Brisini

said that the residents of Building #l come to the clinic for their
exams, cleanings, and treatments. He said he goes to the wards of
Building #7 to serve those residents, while for Buildings #2 thru #6,
he works on the residents in the nurses‘ station. Sane of these areas

are equipped with suction facilities.

In spite of the findings of this examiner, Dr. Brisini made a number
of references to the low incidence of dental decay of the residents.
He stated that for all the residents except those in Building #l,
he used two tongue blades to perform his oral exams rather than the’
standard mouth mirror and explorer. His detection of caries was,

therefore, essentially visual rather than tactile.

Page 5

It appeared that chartings were not routinely done on the residents.
Of the 4l residents examined by this investigator, approximately
’ =ad any notation at all on the tooth diagrams of their

charts. These notations should include some designation for carious

areas, restored areas, missing teeth, and teeth’in need of extraction.

when residents were jointly examined by Dr. Brisini and this
investigator, he concurred with the diagnosis of caries for several
teeth. when asked why he did not chart these decayed areas, he
responded by saying that he did not chart all the little pits.

He said he would watch the teeth and the decay and either fill them
or extract them as necessary. when asked if he let teeth decay
until they had to be extracted, he responded, yes if he felt the
resident was not a candidate for restorative dentistry. In this
vein the examiner asked if some of the residents who were jointly

examined were candidates for restorative dentistry. He said yes,

-but would not answer when asked why only a very few of their decayed

areas were charted. He stated that some of the residents were
extremely difficult to work on. when asked what he did for them,
he responded, "whatever you can.” This was followed with, what can
you do, to which he said, "sometimes nothing." He added that we
have extremely difficult residents here who get restrained for
prophys. when asked about restorative work for these difficult
residents he said, no, it can't be done. He said he bided his time

until a problem developed and then he would take the tooth out. He

.--.... ....- ..-....._. -

said that it is absolutely impossible to do restorative work on some

of the residents.

when asked about in-services, Dr. Brisini said he would do them if
he were asked but he isn't asked very often. He reported that he
did conduct an in—serivce about a month ago for a group of direct

care personnel.

Dr. Brisini had a variety of complaints regarding a lack of cooperation
between him and the administration. He considered the superintendent,
Dr. Hartley, to be "anti-medical“ and has not informed him of his

needs at all. Dr. Brisini mentioned to this investigator the need

for an examining table a number of times. This is an appropriate

need as many of the residents can not sit in a standard dental chair
due to posturing problems. He was asked if he asked Dr. Hartley to

get him an examining table; he said no, and felt "they" knew about

it three years ago when there was some discussion about designing a

new dental clinic. Dr. Brisini also admitted to not having asked (—"’,r’//

Dr. Hartley for x-ray developing facilities, a high speed handpiece,

or suction equipment. Dr. Brisini stated that he had to bring his
own contra-angles because he could not get the state to supply them.
He said he ordered them three or four times but could not recall the

last time an order was placed.

Page 7

Dr. Brisini also said he worked for ten years before he could get
the state to supply the clinic with local anesthesia. Until 1967,
he was bringing it in from his own office. Dr. Brisini was also

upset that he did not get to interview the hygienist who was hired

in May of this year.

This investigator met Dr. Reyes, the Medical Director, who has been
employed at Ebensburg Center for five years. when asked if he was
aware of inadequate dental facilities and equipment, he said no.

He then turned to Dr. Brisini and said, "I think you have all of
the equipment you would want to useL:_ A list of needed equipment

and improvements was never submitted to the Medical Director.

Dr. Brisini allowed this investigator to make copies of his monthly
reports for the last six months. A copy of these figures can be
found at the end of this report. It should be noted that in this

six month period, 66 teeth were extracted while only l3 were restored.

when trying to find some reason for the lack of facilities and
equipment, Dr. Brisini made many references to Dr. Ralph Rusynyk
and some sort of study conducted roughly three years ago to re-do

the dental facilities.

In conclusion, this investigator examined 4l residents in a period

of two days. The exams were perfonned with a mouthnmirror and explorer.

Page 8

It should be noted that the proper number of adequateiy trained
peopie was not avaiiabie to assist in these exams. Nor were adequate
restraints or mouth propping devices, which are necessary in some
cases, avaiiabie. Of the 41 residents checked, 25 had 91 teeth

which demonstrated dentai decay ranging in severity from incipient
catches to very advanced stages of destruction. Of these 91 decayed
teeth, iess than 20% were noted on the tooth diagrams of the residents‘
charts. No treatment plans were found for any residents on any
medical or dental document. This investigator questions whether

Dr. Brisini even detected aii or any of these areas and if so, how

he intended.to keep track of them without appropriate charting and

treatment pianning.

RECOMMENDATIONS

A new dental facility is needed since the present one is too small.
A decision must be made regarding the establishment of one central
dental clinic or multiple mini-clinics in or near the living units.
Factors to consider are transportation of residents to and fran a
central facility taking into account inclement weather and the

availability of personnel to escort the residents, canpared to the

duplication of expense for equipment necessary for the mini-clinics.

Equipment for a central dental facilityshould include at least:

a. Two Dental~Eze contour chairs with power bases and backs.

b. Two Adec Mini-Trol or Tray-Trol units each equipped with one
slow speed and one high speed handpiece, plus an air-water
spray syringe.

c. At least one Dentsply Cavitron model lOlO with capability to
service either chair.

d. One central high speed evacuation unit with outlet stations at
each chair.

e. One Philips portable x-ray machine. This can be moved to either
chair, plus it can be used for residents in wheel chairs or
exam tables. Many times x-ray machines which are floor mounted_

can not reach residents in wheel chairs.

f. A Philips automatic x-ray processor.

Page l0

g. Two Papoose Boards; one large and one extra large.

h. At least one amalgamator.

i. Aspirating syringes, hand instruments and supplies to allow
for the delivery of modern, efficient, quality dental care.

3. Hire one full-time or a number of part-time dentists to equal a
full-time equivalency. Men or women with training in dental care
for the handicapped are preferred. These will usually be Pedodontists.
Ideal candidates for this position are recently graduated Pedodontists
who are looking for part-time work to supplement their private

practice income. Long term employment should not be too heavily

considered. (See enclosed job description.)

4. Hire a minimum of two dental assistants, preferrably previously

+— T

trained in dental skills. At least one of these assistants should
be a male. It will be difficult to find trained dental assistants
with experience in working with retarded individuals. One dental
assistant can also be trained as a clinic manager. This assistant
could be responsible for scheduling patients and at the same time

provide continuity between dentists if multiple part-time professionals

are employed. (See enclosed job description.)

5. Hire at least one full-time dental hygienist. Her duties would

include annual or semi-annual cleanings, as well as in-service training

I

for the direct care personnel. with two hygienists, one can concentrate
on daily clinical routines and recall while the other develops
elaborate in-service training programs and conducts ward, unit, or
dormitory programs to promote the daily brushing of the residents‘
teeth. (See job description)

The state or the Department of welfare or whatever agency is responsible
must very seriously consider making significant increases in the
salaries of the dentist, the hygienist, and the assistant. It is not
fair to ask trained professionals to do an exceptionally difficult job
for an exceptionally low salary. The pay group of the dental assistant:

should be elevated and the opportunities for advancement and pay raises

for the assistant should be made comparable to other state positions.

Prerequisites for hiring should be established and adhered to. If
dentists, hygienists, or assistants are hired without previous
experience in care for the retarded, provisions should be made for
continuing education. Courses could be conducted within the state
by trained people, or personnel would be sent to other states where
dental schools, hospitals, or university affilliated facilities

conduct continuingoeducation courses in dental care for the develop-

mentally disabled.

The Department of welfare must make greater efforts to get the

three dental schools within the state involved in care for the

Page l2

handicapped. More clinical as well as more didactic time must be
allotted in care for the retarded and multi-handicapped child and
adult for all dental students. Externships and rotations for graduate
students, dental students, and hygiene students should be established.
Mental retardation centers should investigate the possibility of
contributing money for Faculty salaries. These faculty members would
be assigned to a center where they or graduate students would provide
dental care for the residents and a learning experience for the
students. Dental school Departments of Pedodontics, Oral Surgery,
Orthodontics, and Periodontics would find an abundant population in
the centers who desperately need the kinds of dental work provided

by these specialties.

The Department of welfare should investigate the possibility of
establishing a Dental Director's position for the state institutions.
This person could implement programs and provide leadership. Based
upon findings regarding the lack of dental services in three mental
retardation centers and considering the possibilities that other
centers are in a similar situation, a new group of dentists might

be needed to provide the proper dental services. Judging by the
present availability of dentists with specific training in care for
the handicapped who are willing to take positions in mental retardation
centers, a crash program of orienting new dentists to the whys and
wherefores of dentistry for the handicapped would provide a valuable

training experience..

The list of supplies and equipment which the state maintains on

contract with dental suppliers should be revised and modernized.

Based upon findings at Ebensburg Center and Cresson Center and this
investigator's personal experience with the dental health of the
residents of western Center, it seems imperative that an investigation
of the dental programs at the other mental retardation centers in

the state be implemented as soon as possible.

what role does the Medical Assistance survey team play in evaluating
the dental program at Ebensburg Center? Have they been aware of
the inadequacies stated in this report, and if so, what has been
done about them? If they have not been aware of the obvious gross
dental neglect present in the mouths of the residents, what then is
the purpose of their survey? why are these people being paid to

investigate areas of institutional services, specifically dentistry,

which by their own admission are not within their realm of expertise?

what role has Dr. Ralph Rusynyk played in monitoring the dental

programs and dental health of the residents at Ebensburg Center?

As a consultant to the Department of Welfare, has he done an appropriate
job in identifying problem areas of dental health delivery and making

meaningful recommendations to create changes?

SUMMARY

Grossly inadequate dental care is being provided for the residents
§ 

of Ebensburg Center.

In many instances, teeth in mouths which are being checked at least
semi-annually are being allowed to rot from the ravages of dental

decay until they are no longer salvageable and must be extracted.

Rather than using a mouth mirror and an explorer, exams are being
conducted with tongue blades for the vast majority of the residents.

Areas of decay can not be adequately determined by this method.

Documentation of dental conditions is faulty, inadequate, and just
 

plain non-existent for many of the residents.

Treatment plans for dental work for the residents were not found in
any dental or medical documents contained in the residents‘ folders

or dental charts.

The dental Facility at Ebensburg Center is too small.

The Facility does not have major pieces of equipment which are
necessary to provide quality dental care for the residents. These

include high speed instrumentation, a working Cavitron and x-ray

ll.

developing facilities (see recommendations). Also, the facility

does not employ adequate dental staff (see recommendations).

Excuses for the lack of equipment and personnel should not be tolerated
in light of the absence of documented evidence requesting such. For
example, an attempt made eleven years ago to acquire a high speed
handpiece does not seem to constitute a legitimate attempt at

improvement.

Dr. Brisini administers local anesthesia with non-aspirating syringes.
This is a situation which is considered inappropriate by experts in

the field of anesthesia and pain control.

Dr. Brisini uses one gr. of Pentobarbitol as a standard sedative
dose for many of the residents who require sedation. Standardization

of doses done in this manner is not based on sound dosage principles.

It appears to this investigator that the semi-annual exams performed
on the residents with tongue blades, in most instances, are nothing

more than a sham to satisfy Medical Assistance surveyors.

Due to the lack of formal training and the paucity of informal
training via continuing education courses, Dr. Brisini does not
seem to be aware of techniques for mouth propping, restraining,

and appropriate sedating with chemical agents.

The discrepancy between the number of teeth found to be carious,
during this two day investigation, and the number of restorations
being performed merits a serious investigation. To not restore
areas of frank decay which appear in so many mouths is tantamount
to neglect of the dental health of the individual and by extension,
neglect for his total well being. It is the opinion of this
investigator that a very abusive situation exists in the mouths of
the residents of Ebensburg Center. It is the recommendation of
this investigator that Dr; John Brisini be relieved of his position
as staff dentist of Ebensburg Center. It is further recommended
that steps be taken by the Commissioner of Mental Retardation, the
Deputy Commissioner in charge of institutional programs and the
Superintendent of Ebensburg Center, to provide quality equipment
in a modern facility so that the mouths of the residents can be

restored to proper health by a qualified dentist supported by

qualified auxilliary p rsonnel.

Very few attempts were made throughout this report to quote Dr. Brisini.

It is realized that in spite of this investigator's attempts to put
down on paper exactly what was said, without the use of a tape

recorder, all statements attributed to Dr. Brisini can be denied.
