Dear Mr. Buchanan:

Thank you for your letter of April h, 1075, indicating the '*
.Penn3y1vania Association for Retnried Citizens’ response to the "Modular
Unit Plan," submitted by Mr. Harry Herman, Superintendent of Ebensubrg
.State School and Hospital. As you indicated, there are two separate issues
discussed and I will respond to both.

Upon reviewing the proposed plan, and the subsequent Justifi-
cation by Mr. Andrew Vaveris, it is my opinion that there is no evidence
of planned "permanence." The proposal clearly states that "the_overa1l
goal of the transition services would be to gradually expose and train
the students in handling situations they encounter in subsequent community

' class placements." The utilization of the units in this manner is not

contrary to the ultimate goal of community integration supported by both
the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens and this Department.
The fact that 350 students presently attend classes at the Fbensburg
Borough School indicates our determination to seek this integration.

The proposed utilization of the Vinco Elementary School in September by
an additional 150 students further emphasises our comitment.

While the Department does not support the arbitrary placement of

the demeuntable units on the grounds oi every State School and Hospital,

it will individually support their development when the investigation of

all other ootions are clearly documented as unacceptable. I concur with

the State Task Force's nosition that the most desirable class placement for
all mentally retarded children is within the regular elementary or secondary
school building. I also, however, share the vieunoint of Secretary Pittcnger,
expressed in his memorandum of April 8, 1975, to the Task Force Committee
that we cannot unilaterally exclude other options, even though they are less
desirable. The Department of Public Welfare will sunport the placement of
demountablo units at a State School and Hosnital when 1) all other, more
acceptable community options have been investigated, determined to be

unacceptable and documented, and/or 2) in the opinion of a staff physician,
it is not medically advisable for a student to attend educational classes
off~grounds. In both instances, the denountable units provide a viable,
temporary alternative to the "basement classroos" presently characteristic
in our State Schools and Hospitals.

The need to utilize the units at Ebensburg State School and

Hospital has not been determined to date. I have requested Mr. Herman

and Mr. Robert Vogt, the Central Regional Comissioner for Rental Retar-
dation, to investigate the present and projected educational situation.
Their recommendations and justifications will be forwarded to me for my
review. Based upon this review, I will make a decision relative to place-
ment of the Units.

The second issue of providing educational services to those
residents over 21 years of age is a major concern of this Department. The
increasing number of residents reaching this age requires that additional
educational opportunities and appropriate space be explored and provided.
This must occur if we are to continue to meet the educational, developmental

‘goals of the individual. I am suggesting that representatives from both the

Office of Mental Retardation and the State School and Hospital Superintenu
dents meet, at the earliest possible time, with representatives from the
Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens to discuss this situation.
The development of a plan of action with appropriate implementation
delineated, is a matter of great concern.

Thank you for your expressed concerns and please be assured that
I share your desire to provide quality educational services to all of the
residents of our State Schools and Hospitals.

Very truly yours,

Frank S. Beal
