"We are doing a sTaffing conference on 25 To 30 persons per week."

"l don'T have a problem. We all have a problem. ThaT's whaT I Tell

"ParenTs oughT To see where Their kids live, buT I don'T wanT Them
JusT comelng in, folding Their hands, sTand over The sTaff and observe. if
iT's mealTime, The parenT should feed Their kid. if Their child needs changed,
They should change Their child."

"l'm noT changing The visiTaTion rules now because I Think iT would be
overwhelming To The parenTs. They'd have To sTop saying Polk is fanTasTic

punishmenT."

advocaTes also."

"You can'T JusT issue direcTives. I could dicTaTe a policy righT now,
