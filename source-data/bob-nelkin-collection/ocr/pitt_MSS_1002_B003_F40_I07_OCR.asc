Dear Mr. and Mrs. I-:  ‘

I have received the reports of the Medical, Nursing and

.Social Service Departments in response to your letter received A '

January 7, 1974.
formally after a recent Board of Trustees meeting.

I also had occasion to talk with Mr. L‘ in-

Let me say at the outset that I am at something of a loss
as to the best way to constructively respond to your letter. The
reports that I have received from my staff, my conversation with Mr.
L_ and discussions with my staff have ‘left me with the feeling
that everyone has been very concerned about Mark over the last
several months, but that the communication of this concern has become

cious of each other. While there may have been reasons for the frus-
tration, and the resulting breakdown in communication on all sides,
this state of affairs is hardly a basis on which a joint effort to

help Mark can be based.

Perhaps it would help to set the stage for a new look at
Mark and relationships between his parents and the staff of Western
if I review the highlights of Mark's period atgwesternz

1. Mark was admitted in August of 1971, initially. Mark's admission
was to be for a temporary period while Mrs. _ underwent
needed corrective surgery. The temporary admission was made long

 term in October of 1971. A meeting between Mrs. Leonard and the
Unit Team took place on November ll, 1971 and with the Clothing
Attendant on December 17, 1971. Atthis time, several matters of
concern to Mrs. L: were discussed, including Mark's medica-
tion and injuries Mark had received. '

2. There were infrequent visits by Mr. and Mrs. L‘ from April
1972 and July of 1973 during which time the family was living out
of state. ' '

3. In March of 1973, Mark's case was reviewed by Dr. Irving Chamovitz,
our Neurological Consultant, as part of a review of medication of
all seizure patients. At the time Dr. Chamovitz reviewed Mark's
case it was his opinion that Mark should be tried on Dilantin
since it is, as a rule, a better anti-convulsant than Valium. Dr.
Trudy Elterich, Mark's Unit Physician, followed Dr. Chamovitz's
suggestion and gradually reduced Mark's Valium medica;ion while

_ 2 _

increasing his Dilantin. Apparently at thisxtime there was a slip—up
and Miss Salus, the Social sarviaé Worker on Hér£*§”ﬁhi:,fwa§ not””
aware 55 the medication change and consequently did not communicate
the change to you: “WhiI§”fhéfE was no immediate ch3ng§”iﬁ“M§Tk*s”“'
seizure pattern following the change in medication, there was an in-
crease in seizures in June and July of 1973. Following a series of
seizures, on July 28, 1973 Mark was placed back on Valium. On August
2, 1973 there was another meeting between Dr. T. Elterich, Miss Salus
and Mrs. 1- to discuss Mark's medication. Except for two mild
and one severe seizure in October, Mark remained seizure—free until
just before Christmas when he again had a series of seizures. At
about this time there was another conversation between Mrs. L-
and Dr. Elterich, this time by phone. In January, another series of

' seizures occurred. In order to assist in finding a better balance

of medication, Dr. Chamovitz has seen Mark in January and February
and plans to see him again in March. ‘

Turning to the specific questions raised in your letter:
1. Frequency of Seizures and Reporting of Seizures:
a. Frequency of Seizures:

1971 (5 months) none recorded
1972 6 of mild nature (Petit Mal)
1973 28 of mild nature

13 of severe nature (Grand Mal)

.Reporting of Seizures;

The Social Service Worker is notified of injuries or other
incidents occurring to residents via an Incident Report. The
Nursing Department has not routinely notified the Social Ser-
vice Department of all seizures, but will notify the Social

Service Department of a marked change in a seizure pattern, eg.

a marked increase or decrease or change in severity. The
Social Service Worker has the responsibility of contacting the
parents about these changes.

2. Medications prior to July 1973:

As noted above in March a gradual discontinuing of Valium and sub-
stituting of Dilantin and Phenobarbital was initiated.

3. Medication gdjustment Before Seizure of July 1973:
As noted above, adjustments were initiated in March of 1973.
Adjustment in Medication After July Seizure:

Valium was re-instituted at this time.

_ 3 _

Was Mark's Medical History Reviewed and Evaluated before Treatment

.and before Adjustment of Medications were Made:

As noted earlier, Mark's case was reviewed by Irving Chamovitz,
M.D., our Neurological Consultant, as part of an effort to review
all seizure patients.

Notification of Seizures and Medication Adjustments:

As noted earlier, there was apparently a failure to notify Miss
saIG§‘bf the plans to gradually change the medication. Since there
was not a marked change in Mark's seizure pattern, thEM§EiEﬁfE§7
were not called to Miss Salus' attention. "‘ "WW"

Medications Since August of 1973:.

Valium, Dilantin, and Thorazine

Seizures week of December 17:

No seizures were recorded in December until Saturday, the 22nd atc:
which time 7 mild and 2 severe seizures were recorded.

Day and Time of Grand Mal Seizureﬁ

Seizures began at 6:10 a.m. lasting until 7:40 a.m. on December 22,
1973.

Specific Orders or Instructions Given:

The physician on call was called when it became apparent that Mark
had entered a series of seizures. The physician also checked Mark
1ater_the same morning. '

Circumstances Surrounding Seizure:

Mark, who usually sleeps well, had been awake since 3 a.m. on the
day of the seizure. However, because of holiday activities and ex-

'citement, many of the residents had had a restless night. For this
' treason, Mark's behavior did not appear to be cause for concern.

Mow Long Did the Seizure Last:

As noted above, from 6:10 a.m. to 7:40 a.m.
Were There Injuries Sustained:

Several minor bumps and scrapes.

Mhat Treatment Was Given:

The minor bumps and scrapes were cleansed.

_ 4 _

were the Social Worker and Parents Notified:

The 22nd of December being a Saturday, there would be normally no
report made to the Social Service Department until Monday, unless
the nurse or physician felt there was need to contact the parents
immediately. I understand that Mr. L— was iﬁ'"”t'o" visit Mark
on the 23rd. I gather no one mentioned the seizures a£“Ehat time.
This is rather hard to understand. It is possible that this oc-
curred because there was apparently a relief nurse on duty that
was not familiar with either Mark or Mr. L‘ '

Was Mark's Medical History Reviewed and Evaluated Before Treatment
of the Seizures was Given: '

If the thrust of this question is "did the ‘on call‘ physician
respond to the initial call of the nurse by reviewing the Medical
Record before initiating treatment", the answer is obviously "no".
Such a review would only be possible if Western had 24 hour, seven
day a week resident and medical staff similar to a full fledged
hospital. Treatment was initiated based on the physician's best
judgement based on the nurse's report. The physician did follow-
up his telephone instructions when he came to the facility a few
hours later. ’- '

Medication Adjustment Afterwards:

The reports I have received do not indicate a medication adjustment
immediately following the December 22 series of seizures. ‘Dr.
Chamovitz did suggest aasmall increase in Mark's Valium when he saw

him early in January.

' In concluding, may I point out again that on both sides there‘
appears many feelings of suspicion and distrust. On your side, Mr. and-
Mrs. 1-, the tone of your letter is abrasive to many of our staff
who feel that they have made every effort to be open with you. It is
apparent that you do not feel that you have received satisfactory an-
swers to your questions and concerns. Under these circumstances, I

gbelieve a conference of those concerned for Mark's well-being may help
to clear the air. Please let me or Miss Salus know whether you wish
such a conference.

Sincerely;

f?JZiltner
