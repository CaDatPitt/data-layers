Dear Ms. Wohlgemuthz

I was an employee of Polk State School and Hospital from June,
1971 until July 1972 assigned to the Nursery Building, ward F.
The residents in this ward are profoundly and severely retarded
and many are also physically handicapped. They range in age from
five to sixteen years. This does not make me an expert on condi-
tions at Polk State School, but I did learn a great deal about
caring for the retarded and the problems involved in their care.
I was reprimanded by the building nurse shortly after I began
working at Polk for having tied a little girl to a chair. I had
not done this to be cruel. It was the best method I could find at
the time to keep her from falling off the_chair. She has cerebral
palsy and could not hold herself upright. In fact, she has fallen
several times from her chair usually striking her head on the
floor since she is not able to catch herself with her arms. which
treatment is then really cruel? The child was never injured while
I was on duty.

It is my opinion that the methods used at Polk State School

‘are generally protective and in the best interests_of the resi-

dents. Perhaps those who have not had any close association with-
profoundly and severely retarded patients do not understand how
difficult it sometimesflo protect them or to protect the other
residents from them. I do not think that one should be so

_ critical of existing methods unless one can suggest and show to

be effective some other method of dealing with the problem.

I could cite many other instances during my employ at Polk
when residents were restrained for their own protection or the
protection of others simply because there seemed to be no other
way to deal with them. We had the best patient-employee ratio
at Polk (3-1) and yet we could not supervise each resident
constantly. A

I do not know exactly what the case against Dr. McCle1land is
really all about and I do not know Dr. Mcclelland personally at
all. I do think that much of the publicity about Polk State school
has been misleading and that the impulsive firing of Dr. McClelland
is unjustified.

Yours truly,
