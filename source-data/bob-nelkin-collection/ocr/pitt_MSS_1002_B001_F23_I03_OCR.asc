a check and balance on professionals.

be highly controversial and in the public eye.

3) Citizen monitoring will continue the social change
started by citizens calling for reform of state institutions.

H) Citizen involvement will bridge gap between reality
and misconceptions held by public about the handicapped.

5) The citizens involvement will help generate extensive
community support countering the institutions base of out-of-
sight, out-of-mind.

6) Vast expenditure of public funds in the CLA program
to serve at least H50 individuals this year require judgement
from varied sources including citizen volunteers and PARC
that C.L.A.s are beneficial to residents and deserve expanded
funding.

7) Monitoring spearheaded by citizen volunteers will

minimize possibility of bedlam like living conditions for‘

retarded like have recently been exposed for mentally ill.
8) Citizen monitoring will lessen the fears of the many

relatives who have contacted ACC-PARC regarding the care
and training of relatives in or scheduled for C.L.A.s.

10) The MH/MR Act mandates both evaluation of programs

and involvement of citizens.
