To: All Department Heads 
Subject: Review and Implementation of Policies. 

  

As you know, we had established a Policy Review Committee, Chai
by Father Kirk, to review all existing policies of care and treatment
of our residents. The purpose of this committee is to examine all poli-
cies that are in existence, to review such policies, and to recommend
changes where needed. It is our intent to insure that all policies which
are in effect in this institution will protect and guarantee human dignity
and the rights and development of the residents.

The attached.policy statements are to be communicated to all employee
in your departments, and implemented immediately. I would urge that a
copy of the policies be kept by departments in folders that will be accessible
to all staff so that everyone is fully acquainted with the policies of the
school.

The Policy Review Committee will continue its work of policy review,
and future policy statements will be issued. Your cooperation in the
implementation of this directive will be appreciate.
