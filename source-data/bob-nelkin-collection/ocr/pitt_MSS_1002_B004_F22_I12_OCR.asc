Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:

I; as a parent of a retarded son (living at.homeY, am greatly
disturbed by what appears to be a high-handed handling of the
Polk situation.

My husband and I have had quite a bit-of contact with Dr.
Mcclelland and Polk in the past years.. we both feel that he
is an unusually able administrator who has handled an_impos—
sible situation of overcrowding and lack of funding fantas-
tically well. -

when you and I can supply the means to employ attendants on a
on-to-one basis, we will be able to dispose of all restraints.

My own feeling is that this is too costly and.not even neces-
sary.. No one gets hysterical when we confine our young child-
ren to play pens so that we can keep them out of harm and go
about our business. The responsible person has to have an al--
ternative before an old method of handling a situation is re-
moved. Those very patients whom you seek to help might not
even be able to tolerate the freedom of movement suddenly thrust
upon them.

My husband and I have toured Polk, including some of the so-
called back wards, and give our whole-hearted support to Dr.
Mcclelland. we feel his accomplishments are commendable and
that he"s being the sdape goat for society“s neglect.

Sinderely yours,

L’ ‘ /‘  ,
