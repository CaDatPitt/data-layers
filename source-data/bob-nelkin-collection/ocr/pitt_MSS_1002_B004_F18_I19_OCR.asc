Dear Ms. Wohlgemuth: _ $429”

(_/W

I read with great interest the brief articleAabout the situation
at Polk State School and your action in firing the superintendent.
There is of course more to the story than the article describes,
but having been involved in working both with retarded children
and with so—ca1led delinquent children in Indiana and in Dela~
ware, I have learned how to read a bit between the lines.

Secretary of Welfare, Helene Wohlgemuth
Harrisburg, Penna. -

To the uninitiated, the idea of putting people in "pens" is
horrifying. After working with such people, however, I came

to the conclusion that if they were properly used such de-

vices were far and away the most humane, for all concerned.

If your child was assaulted by an‘ungovernable peer in such

an institution, you would want the ungovernable child restrained.
If your child was so destructive, you would hope that he could
be retrained...and filling the child full of tranquillizers,
isolating him entirely from others, or physically punishing him
just doesn't retrain him properly.

I don't know Dr. Mcclelland, but it is certainly rare for both
staff and patients to express such regard for the person at
the top of an institution of this sort. It is a thankless
job, at best. I saw many idealistic programs start, and fade
away due to lack of money, understanding, cooperation, unity
of staff purpose, education, etc. This in turn made many
very good people quit in despair...everyone needs to see the
results of their labors in some way, and when you deal with
the retarded, you do not get thanks from them, as you might
if you were a medical doctor who cured you of a painful ail-
ment.

It was my conclusion that both restraint and retraining were
equally needed in such institutions; But you can get surprises.
In one institution for delinquents that I worked in, an "iso-
lation cell" was kept as a "last resort" for inmates who failed
to cooperate and appreciate the relatively open program. Within
two weeks of opening the facility, we had to create two more of
these cells because the boys begged to go in them to protect
them from the more aggressive inmates who assaulted and raped
the new boys as they arrived if they refused to "cooperate" and,
"submit" to their demands! So you have to really understand‘the
situation before you jump to conclusions. An institution is NOT
like an open society, and it never can be. ' '

With best wishes for your success. I'm sure you are deeply
dedicated to improving a sad situation. Sincerely,

- r’ '7 .
