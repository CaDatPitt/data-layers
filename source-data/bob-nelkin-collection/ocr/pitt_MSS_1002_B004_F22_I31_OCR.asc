Madam:

As an employee of Polk State School and Hospital, I am
protesting the dismissal of Dr. James Mcclelland. I feel

the charges brought against him are unjust and totally
unfounded. There are inadequacies at Polk, but Dr. Mcclelland
has made a concious effort to make realistic improvements
considering the overcrowed conditions which exist. I
seriously question your competency as Secretary of D.P.W.
when you make decisions such as this. Your ignorance of

Polk is exemplified through your rash decision from a two
hour visit and from information gathered from questionable

‘sources. I feel strongly that you must reinstate Dr.

Mcclelland and publicly apologize to him.

Most Sincerelyﬂ
