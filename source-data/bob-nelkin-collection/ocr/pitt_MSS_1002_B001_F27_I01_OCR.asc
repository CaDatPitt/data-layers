Dear Chuck,

Urgent, unmet needs of mentally retarded citizens
and their families were shared with you and the MH/MR
Board on February 16, 1978. The needs are serious. The
parents‘ presentations were sobering.

I know you agree that these parents should not be
ignored and that their concerns must not be neglected.

The parents‘ needs are real and should be included
in the County Plan. Basically, these needs and corres-
ponding services are not mentioned in the Plan.

The lack of current plans puzzles us. Parents
made these very same needs known in public meetings in
May, June, August, and November, 1976. The results of
those meetings (attended by County office personnel)
were duly communicated to you.

The most often mentioned needs fall into four cate-
gories:

l) Respite care for families of persons all ages and
needs.

2) Programs for severely, multiply handicapped people.

3) Programs for individuals who are mentally retarded
and emotionally disturbed or mentally retarded and exhibiting
aggressive behavior.

H) Adult training programs for persons with a variety
of needs.
