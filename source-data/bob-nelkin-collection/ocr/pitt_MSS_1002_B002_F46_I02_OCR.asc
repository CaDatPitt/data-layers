Pennhurst problems

By BILL MOONEY

A rape, a fire and an assault: Pennhurst’s track
record the last month.

Something has to be done: Close the institution
or improve it so it resembles something suitable
for human habitation.

If the state lets the home for 975 mentally re-
tarded people keep going like this, even the most
hard-line deinstitutionalization opponents will be
clamoring to close the place.

What's going on there has been going on for
years, some will argue. That's a valid point that
doesn't excuse conditions today.

There are court orders that say Pennhurst has
to be better, there’s an administration that wants
to make it better, there's even a state govern-
ment that professes a desire to make it better.

Still, this stuff continues.

It's not the staff's fault per se. 'l‘here’s not
enough staff there to handle the everyday prob-
lems, let alone prevent the almost inexcusable

. situations that have been happening.

Harrisburg controls the hiring, and Harrisburg
has been cutting back on Welfare personnel wher-
ever it can.

The standard line from the Welfare Depart-
ment PR office is that Thornburgh has a commit-
ment to phasing out Pennhurst at its own pace.

At the rate the state's going, those severly and
profoundly retarded people may be beat uP. 35-
saulted or injured in some probably preventable
accident before they move out.

And some may move out in a coffin.
That's another story though. Before U.S. Dis-
trict~Judge Raymond Broderick next Tuesday,

there’ll be a hearing on a retardation expert’s
findings that the deaths of many Pennhurst resi-
dents could be prevented with a more efficient
medical system and more and better trained per-
sonnel.

The courts are settling whether the mentally .

retarded belong in communities or institutions,
but no one, not even those who prefer Pennhurst
over unproven community settings, can justify

the sword of Damocles lifestyle that Pennhurst ,

clients live under.

Pennhurst may or may not be any different ,

from any other institution in this state. It gets
more publicity than any other facility because of
the court case and its constitutional importance.

It would make sense then that if the state wants
to further institutionalization it would make sure -
that the standard of living at its most publicized .-
institution would be better than the life of a wood- —.

en duck in a shooting gallery.

If it wanted to close Pennhurst in its own way
and at its own pace, it had the chance to stop
waffling and step up the pace. Now, the state’s
hands might be tied by the Supreme Court's ruling
that no one can be forced from Pennhurst until
the case is settled.

People who oppose Pennhurst’s closing often I
claim community living is insecure and danger-._“

ous to the residents.

Pennhurst in its current state isn’t much bet- '5

ter, and each day that it continues in this condi-
tion is just one more argument for closing it
down.

If Pennsylvania wants to convince the Supreme

. Court this fall to let Pennhurst stay open, they

better make Pennhurst more of a home and less
of a danger zone. .
