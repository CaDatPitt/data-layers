  Dear Ms. Wohlgemuth,

0'

I am writing to tell you how concerned I

I

am about the situation that you found on your recent visit to

Polk State School and Hospital. It is heartening to know that I ' *5
* you took imediatté action. How did a man like Dr. McClellendp' ;

-u-...,

get away with methods such as these? Did he have no one to:7"{ V
answer to..no board of review..no periodic inspections hyiteansi ?
of the qualified? Imagine how long this has been going on aND~:_-
how long it would have continued had you not made you’re’ I
surprise visit. IL
I am 24. dcollege student,and weekend radio

announcer. And I've got this nagging feeling that these kinds ~ ti
of conditions exist elsewhere in our state, and in other.partsﬁ'
of the country. And it's nothjust the physical conditions thatfl '
are often deplorable. But how often do patients get therapyglﬁ%I'
and guidance? And are mental hospitals run in a similiar way?"
Let's have more of these surprise visits..to other institutions;
we all have some idea of what our jails are like..and what they
need. But cages and the like in a "hospital" for the retarded?'l‘i
I'm with you 100% on youre' firing of the 'Er.' Please continue

youre/interest in these areas. We must do something for thsee_

poor people. Can I do anything? If so, please write-
