Dear Representative Cessar:

Mrs. Stella W. Kandzer, 151 Elmwood Drive, Glenshaw,
Pa. 15116, requested that we inform you of the lack of
services for citizens who are both mentally retarded and
emotionally disturbed or exhibiting behavior problems.

The problem is serious. Because there are few ser-
vices, individuals tragically regress rather than pro-
gress. Families experience intense stress. In some

cases, families or other individuals suffer bodily injury.

The "System's" response to these needs disappoints
us. Mental health programs reject the clients because
they are mentally retarded. Mental retardation programs
reject the clients because they are mentally ill.

Some Allegheny County residents are sent to programs
far out of the county or out of the state. Some indivi-
duals are dumped, without regard for their needs, into
state institutions. Outrageous levels of medication are
used to "quiet" the residents in place of training.

From our view, state, region, and county officials
have failed to develop these needed services during the
last five years. Some of the reasons why for their
failure include: the risk of dealing with persons with
severe emotional problems, the lack of expertise of men-
tal retardation program staff, and prejudice against
serving mentally retarded individuals by psychiatrists
and other professionals who are experts with emotional
problems.

I think the families we represent would like to see:

1) a community MH/MR system which provides specialized
services to help families reduce aggressive or abnormal
behavior of their children and reduce the resulting stress
on the family.

2) the development of community residential programs
for adolescents and adults in the cases where the family
can no longer successfully fulfill this responsibility be-
cause of extreme behavior.

3) the conversion of some units in the state centers
and hospitals to specialize in the care of people with be-
havior problems, who currently reside in the institutions.

H) total enforcement of each person's state and federal
right to treatment in the least restrictive alternative and
due process prior to such arrangements.

If you share these goals and are as concerned as members
of our chapter, you might wish to meet with us or others to
learn more about the problem and eventually stimulate the
Office of Mental Retardation and the Office of Mental Health
of the Department of Public Welfare to aggressively develop
quality services.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Robert Nelkin
