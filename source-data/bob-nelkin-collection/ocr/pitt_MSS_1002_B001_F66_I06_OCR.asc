Dear Mr. Peters:

I have received your letter of April 28 regarding
the applicability of the Department of Public Wel-
fare's lien law as it affects parents of children
residing in state schools and hospitals and interim
care facilities for the mentally retarded. I have
referred your letter to Deputy Attorney General
Edgar Casper for consideration, and you will be
hearing from my office in the near future.

Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.

Sincerely yours,
