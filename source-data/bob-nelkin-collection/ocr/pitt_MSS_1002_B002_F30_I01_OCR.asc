O.c\

As an addition to the Longitudinal Study of the Court-Ordered
Deinstitutionalization of Pennhurst, questionnaires were mailed to the
families of clients who were relocated to Community Living Arrangements
(CLAs) between the date of the Court Order, March l7, 1978, and April 30,
l980. This report summarizes the results.*

There were 99 clients who were relocated to southeast region CLAs
during that time period. Of these, family contacts were known for 79.
Introductory letters were mailed to the 79 families in February, l98l.

Five letters were returned by the Post Office for incornact addresses. In
late February, survey forms and return envelopes were mailed to the remaining
74 families.

By March 25, 28 responses had been received (38%). Three of these
were returned blank because the families were either disabled or had not
seen their relatives since birth. A second mailing was conducted to reach
the remaining families. Twelve additional valid responses were received; four
others wrote that they chose not to participate, and one claimed no relationship

with the client. The summary of the survey response was as follows:

79 ADDRESSES
-5 INCORRECT ADDRESSES
-3 BLANK, HAVE NOT SEEN CLIENT IN MANY YEARS
-l NO RELATIONSHIP TO CLIENT
7O VALID POTENTIAL RESPONDENTS
-4 REFUSED
-29 NON-RESPONSE
-57 VALID RESPONSES

* This study is not to be confused with the survey of families of
Pennhurst residents performed May-June 1980 and reported December 1,
l980. The present study surveyed the families of clients who were
deinstitutionalized before that survey was conducted.

These 37 valid responses out of 70 potential responses indicated a valid
response rate of 53%. The complete response rate would be calculated as
3 + 1 + 4 + 37/74, or 59.5%.

Because 53% was lower than we had hoped, we tested for non-respondent
bias to see whether the clients not represented in the survey were different
from those who were represented. The results were as shown in Table 2:

Clearly the respondent - group clients were not very different from the non-respondent
group clients. we therefore accepted the 53% response rate as adequate; we rejected
the possibility of telephoning all non-respondents, which, on such a sensitive topic,

would have been highly intrusive.

RESULTS

Among the 37 respondents, 20 were mothers of the clients, 8 were
fathers, and 9 were other relatives. Ten respondents had less than a high
school education, 14 were high school graduates, 5 had some college, and 5
had a college degree or more; 3 did not answer. There were 32 who listed

themselves as white, 2 Black, and 3 who did not answer.

SATISFACTION WITH RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT
Relatives responded to two 5-point Likert scales on "How satisfied
(are/were) you with the services your relative (received/is receiving) from

(Pennhurst/the CLA)?"

Former Present

l. Very satisfied ll 2l

Blank l l
Average satisfaction on 5-point scale: 2.50 --------- --1.81

Test of difference: t = 2.04, df = 35, p = .024, l-tail
Thus the respondents were much more satisfied with the community settings than
they had been with the institution. (Families of current residents of Penn-
hurst reported higher satisfaction with Pennhurst, averaging l.72 instead

of 2.50 - from report of December l,l980, already cited.)

Significance of change: t = 0.20, df = 34, p = .422, l-tail

The often repeated assertion that clients released to community-based
settings would experience increased visits from relatives was not supported.
There was no significant change in the frequency of family visits to the
service setting. (Current Pennhurst families visited clients less often than

this 2.68 average; 2.94 was their average.)

Significance of change: t = 1.78, df = 36, p = .042, l-tail

There was a slight increase in the frequency of client visits to their
families‘ homes after community placement. (Current Pennhurst clients visited
home much less often than had this relocated group while they were at Penn-

hurst: 3.65 for this group, 4.25 for the current Pennhurst group.)

Thus relatives have become significantly more positive about CLA placement now
that they have witnessed it. Initial fears have lessened considerably. A
crosstabulation showed only 2 relatives to be more negative now than initially,
while 13 were more positive - and 22 felt the same as they did initially - 18

agreed, 1 neutral, 3 disagreed. (Current Pennhurst families opposed relocation

.far more than these families when first considered: 4.12 versus 2.46.)

- PERCEIVED CHANGES SINCE RELOCATION OF CLIENT
Fourteen questions about changes since the client moved from Pennhurst

to a CLA yielded the following responses:

In the column on the right, a score of 3 would mean that families, on the
average, felt there had been no change. Anything above 3 would mean a change for

the better. First, the data show that no area has been affected negatively on the

average. Second, the largest positive effect was in the clients‘ general
happiness; next was in the clients’ relationships with other people,
followed by the clients‘ relationships with the respondent. (Current Penn-
hurst families were previously asked how they thought each of these areas
would be affected jj_their relative were relocated. Average scores were

closer to "worse" for every item.)

ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS

A series of questions on attitudes and beliefs were included. Each
response was on a 5-point scale, where l = Strongly Agree. to 5 = Strongly
Disagree. we calculated the average score for each item. These results

are shown on the following page.

FAMILY ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS

I believe that my relative has reached (his/her) highest
level of educational and psychological development and

will g9t_progress much beyond the level (he/she) is at now. ....

when my relative lives away from home, I prefer that (he/she)

remain in the same place for (his/her) entire lifetime. ....

when my relative lives away from home, I prefer that
(he/she) move from a more protected residential
setting to a more open setting as (he/she)

achieves greater self—help skills. ....

Persons who work in community living arrangements
are knowledgeable and skillful enough to handle all
situations which may arise with regard to your

mentally retarded relative. ....

I believe that funding for community living

arrangements is secure and permanent. ....

I believe that all services needed by my relative

are available to (him/her) in the community. ....

My family has not had to assume added financial
burdens for the care of our relative since (he/she)

left Pennhurst. ....

Normalization means that, as much as possible,
mentally retarded persons are given normal
opportunities for living, working and school. In
thinking about what your relative will need in

the future, how much do you agree with this? ....

The Least Restrictive Alternative says that
nentally retarded persons should be allowed to
live in places which are as much like normal
homes as possible. In thinking about what
your relative will need in the future, how much
do you agree with this?

Notice that items were phrased in two ways. For items 15 to 23, a low
score (agreement) indicated support of the ideology behind deinstitution-
alizationgbut for items 13 and 14, agreement (low score) implied opposition

to these component ideals of deinstitutionalization.

As in the survey of families of clients still at Pennhurst, the responses
to items 13 and 14 were discouraging for proponents of the developmental
model. Even these families, who have recently seen the process of relocation
and believed the clients became happier, largely retained their belief that
there was no potential for further growth, and that the client should remain
forever in one residence. The average disagreement with item 15 corroborated
this.

Families generally had confidence in the competence of CLA staff (item 16),
but were concerned about the permanence of CLA funding. (item 17). The availa-
bility of services in the comunity (item 18) seemed to inspire moderate
confidence. There was strong agreement with no-extra-financial-burden (item 19),

with normalization (item 20), and least-restrictive—a1ternative (item 21);

yet agreement with deinstitutionalization was weak, (item 22), and there was
average disagreement with the Court decision to relocate all clients.

This mixture of attitudes, apparently internally inconsistent, was
difficult to interpret. It should provide fertile ground for further study
and for careful professional attention to parental feelings.

(The numbers in the last column, in parentheses, were included to show
the average responses of current Pennhurst families. They were uniformly less

positive about each aspect of deinstitutionalization.)

STRESS

we wished to compare the stress experienced by families during
deinstitutionalization to that experienced at diagnosis and during initial
institutionalization. The 5-point scale ranged from l = Very Stressful through

3 = Somewhat Stressful to 5 = Not At All Stressful. The results were:

§!§ﬂI_ AVERAGE STRESS REPORTED (CURRENT PENNHURST FAMILIESL
Diagnosis l.79 (l.96)

Initial

Institutionalization l.73 (2.40)
Deinstitutionalization 3.50 -

The amount of stress reported at deinstitutionalization (3.50) was, on the
average, between "somewhat stressful" and "slightly stressful." This was
significantly less stress than was reported for the two prior events.

(paired t - tests, p = .001 in both cases).

DISCUSSION

The results presented here are, we believe, representative of the
experiences of all 99 clients who were relocated to CLAs in the Southeast
region from the date of the Court Order through April 30, l980, and their
families. However, those 99 clients/families are not representative of the
group of clients/families still at Pennhurst. The results clearly show
large differences in opinion between the "movers" families and the "stayers"
families. Up to April 30, l980, it was a very rare event for a client to be
relocated over parental objections. The majority of families of these
early movers agreed with, or did not strenuously object to, the notion of
relocation. Any strenuous objection would almost certainly have delayed the
relocation beyond April 30, l980. So to a large extent, the families
described in this report were alwgy§_less opposed to relocation than the
families of clients still at the institution. The feelings of the current
Pennhurst families have been portrayed in a previous report (already_cited,
December l, 1980).

Despite that caution, it is of great interest that even these families,
who initially favored relocation more than the average Pennhurst parent,
favor the idea even mgggnow that it has happened. Moreover, they are far
more satisfied with the CLA setting on the whole than they were with the
institutional setting.

In another previous report (Preliminary Analysis of Client Progress,
Pre and Post Relocation: A Matched Comparison Study, February 25, l98l) we
demonstrated that relocated clients displayed greater developmental growth
than matched peers who remained at Pennhurst. Now we can also claim that

families of relocated clients perceive them to be happier in the CLAs than

-11-

f\

they were at Pennhurst, and aiso to have better reiationships with
the families and with other peop1e. Deveiopmentai growth may not be
the soie criterion of whether people are better off after deinstit-
utionalization; but if one adds the criteria of fami1y satisfaction,
famiiy invoivement, and perceived ciient happiness, these early
Pennhurst Study resuits a1so suggest that CLA settings are programat-

ica11y superior to the institution.
