Joint Visitation Team
Page 4

In Cedar II we learned they too are working with only two staff
members for 45 residents.

There was only one staff member for most of the 39 young women on
Cedar III, while we were visiting the unit. Similar ratios of
staff to residents applied in Cedar IV and Pine II. Understaffing
is the cause of most of the WSSH's tragedies.

(23) Could the WSSH Administration make DPW officials, the
Govern r's Office, and legislators aware on a daily
basis,Athe catastrophic effect of understaffing and
overcrowding? .

(24) What would the WSSH Administration like the parents,
trustees, or PARC to do to make these officials aware
of these dangers?

Placement:

On Pine II, there are a couple of boys living with very grown men.
Team members questioned the appropriateness of these placements.

(25) Will the WSSH staff review and possibly change the
placement of boys currently on Pine II?

Restraints:

The team saw a variety of restraints: quiet rooms (sheets not
checked or initialed for hours), time out chairs filled (with a
waiting list), and parts of day rooms closed off ( to segregate
one individual). ' '

(26) Could more staff skilled in behavior shaping beg
assigned to reduce or modify the aggressive behaviors?

Closing off day rooms reduces the already precious living space for
for the other residents. â€™ .

(27) Could an alternative be found to closing off parts of
day rooms? -

The resident segregated in Pine II was sitting in a urine puddle.
Two visitors got locked in the back part of the day room in Cedar
III. Neither attendants or other visitors heard their calling or
pounding on the door.

(28) If the closing off of quiet rooms continues, will a
staff member be assigned to the segregated part to
improve supervision?
