Dear ﬁrs. Wohlgemuth;

I
The parents of the residents of Folk State School
are not Worrieg; they are angry.
What the tarents, most of the employees and post
of the residents want is for Dr. Mcclelland to be
reinstated and we will not really be’satisfiod
with any other arrangement.

It is beyond me how anvoge could have so much
authority as to FIRE someone without an investi~
gation. I have suggested to Governor Shapp that
you be obliged to wear a straiqht ﬁacket for one
day and work one week in the worst division of the
school before you pass judgment. c

When I brought my son home for Easter, he had a
cut and swollen lip and jaw and no one knew how it
had happened. He is unable to tell anyone then
someone hurts him and there are so many to match,
it is absolutely necessary that the violent ones
be restrained some way and the cages sound ruch
more pleasant than a room in which the person can't
even.see the others or be near them; also better
than restraining belts and jackets etc.
The real fault is§with»our unrealistic society
that forces existence on those poor creatures who
’ q’t reall

     
  

living. - .
' Yours very
