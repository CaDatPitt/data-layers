The Honorab1e Dick Thornburgh
Governor
Commonwea1th of Pennsy1vania
Main Capito1 Bui1ding
Harrisburg, Pennsy1vania 17120
Dear Dick:
There are four reasons why you shou1d stop appea1ing, and in fact,
shou1d vigorous1y imp1ement the March 17, 1978, court order in the Pennhurst

Case.

Reason I: The court order is consistent with the “Thornburgh position”.

I assume you wi11 disagree with no particu1ar part of this order
regarding retarded persons. Testing this assumption, I extracted the key
service provisions from Judge Broderick's order and formed a check1ist to
see where you, at this point, agree with the court order. (See Appendix A)

I wou1d be surprised if you dissented from any of the specific
princip1es of the order.

In fact, a comparison between your major statement on human services
and Judge Broderick's order demonstrates an a1most identica1 vision for the
1ives of Pennsy1vania's retarded citizens.i

A1though the contexts of the two statements differ there is a
resounding simi1arity. The means to accomp1ish goa1s as we11 as the goa1s
themse1ves are identica1! (The Comparison of the two statements is made in
Appendix B.)

On this matter, there is an abundance of evidence indicating c1ear1y

~ that the Judge and the Governor are in phi1osophic harmony.

For the same purpose, your wife has worked diligently over ten years
to obtain the same action from the same parties that Judge Broderick now seeks.
The bulk of Ginny's work does not need to be recalled here. But, the parts
that were vital to the development of this case are terribly relevant.

For it was Ginny, and a small band of her fellow parent-volunteers
who observed, uncovered and cried for reform of the inhumane treatment of
persons in private and state institutions throughout this State. Ginny's
message, and that of the other parents,.was that care of retarded citizens in
this State was shamefully inadequate and that major changes were essential.

The former State Administration responded immediately with appropri-
ate short term measures. In his Pennhurst ruling, Judge Broderick promises to
make that change, cried for by those advocates, unequivocal and lasting.

I see links between the Pennhurst case and the Thornburgh household.
It was in the Thornburgh dining room, on Devon Road, that the need for the Right
to Treatment law suit was discussed and strategies to begin it were developed.
At another time in the Thornburgh living room, next to that dining room, Ginny
and her fellow advocates insisted that PARC's state leadership initiate the
class action suit. State PARC's indispensable involvement in Pennhurst is
history. Steu Brown, former PARC President, informed me that you (maybe from
the Thornburgh kitchen) suggested that PARC seek the U.S. Justice Department's.
intervention and assisted Steu by directing him to Mr. Stanley Pottinger.

Later, Ginny, as ACC-PARC President, sent four-hundred pages docu-
menting inhumane conditions to the United States Justice Department, in the
hope that Justice would enter Halderman V. Pennhurst and extend the impact
statewide.

Importantly, the connection continues. One of the Federal Court's

legal findings was that the l966 Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act

establishes the Right to Adequate Habilitation. The court in its opinion

- 3 -

(pages 65 to 67) cites Joyce Z., the first case where this law was so interpreted.

The Federal Court was secure in leaning on Joyce Z. since more than forty cases
referenced Joyce Z. and also found the Right to Adequate Habilitation. The case
of Joyce Z. (summarized and commented on in Appendix C) would never have ever
begun, nor concluded with Judge Maurice Cohill's precedent setting opinion,
without Ginny's active participation.

And so, the Federal court order is consistent with the very concerns

and objectives which brought the Thornburghs into public life.

Reason II: The order is consistent with state policy

For more than fifteen years standing, Governors of Pennsylvania,
Scranton, Shafer and Shapp proclaimed as state policy the very essence of Judge
Broderick's order. Retarded citizens should be provided opportunities in the
community to develop to their maximum potential.

The Governors‘ statements (Appendix D) should be of no surprise, for
this mandate is repeatedly stated in official state documents. A brief search
found this direction expressed in state laws, regulations, guidelines, budgets,
plans, goals, objectives, position papers, policies, press releases, speeches,
testimony, study team reviews and consultant reports. (See Appendix E)

Often the direction was set most clearly by the Secretary of the
Department.

"The mass warehousing of people afflicted with this

handicap, in isolated institutions providing only

custodial care and little hope for return to their

home or community, is no longer an acceptable

alternative." (Former Secretary wohlgemuth)

"The Governor of Pennsylvania and the Department of

Public welfare are committed to developing and

expanding opportunities in the community so that

every mentally retarded person in this state can

live, work, earn, and enjoy the benefits of living

as normally as possible in the community.“ (Former

Secretary Beal's November l976 Speech to five hundred
parents at an Allegheny PARC meeting in Pittsburgh.)

_ 4 _

Since state policy has been so clearly pronounced by state leaders-
(see also Appendix F) and so often promulgated in official documents, it is
shocking to see the states attornies, in part, ignore, and worse——reverse
the state's position in their arguments to the Court of Appeals.

In my opinion, the brief, unless changed at your direction or not
submitted as part of a larger decision to stop appealing, will mislead the
higher courts.

Numerous questions are raised;

Did the Commonwealth really mean to defend the institution or
argue for its continued existence? Isn't this a reversal of state testimony
at trial, that the state defendants also wanted Pennhurst closed? And doesn't
this position directly contradict the Commonwealth's own experts, who concluded
that Pennhurst is "providing an inadequate and inhumane, dehumanizing type of
environment” and that Pennhurst's existence is "intolerable"?

Did the Commonwealth's lawyers believe that the level of services to
Pennhurst residents was defensible? when our attornies defended the level of
service to the residents, had they read Pennsylvania's own experts’ opinions,
stating that there was: "a serious lack of programs and activities for most
residents“, "a custodial attitude still prevails”, and Pennhurst is "a human
warehouse"? I

were Commonwealth attornies truthful when they argued that there was
no punishment, implied that there was no abuse, and down played the detrimental
effects of excessive drugging? Had our attornies read the experts‘ report,

written for them, concluding that the residents were in danger, that abuse

, occurred, that punishment happened and that Pennhurst was unsafe?

Could our attornies have been knowledgeable about state policy and
still opposed (l) the resident or representative being involved in the planning

for their own future, (2) the enforcement of departmental regulations against

_ 5 _

abuse, (3) the provision of friend/adovcates to assist in the protection of
rights, etc.? ‘

The factual misrepresentatations and reversals of state policy by
Commonwealth lawyers are improper, at least, and, I believe, unethical.
Department officials have not in recent years tried to justify Pennhurst's
dreadful past or current conditions. Our attornies are the first to defend
this inhumanityll

You should correct these mistakes and mis—statements.

The attornies‘ brief to the higher court is routinely refuted
(Appendix G) by, among other authorities, the Commonwealth's own top secret
report. This report, An Analysis of Pennhurst Center: Its relationship to
Mental Retardation Services in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Region (February
1977, Confidential - - for authorized eyes only), was written by experts hired
by the Department of Public welfare to answer questions raised to the experts
by the Department of Justice. PI think of it as "The Pennhurst Papers”.

The 306 page report, plus appendices, was authored by Alexander
Hersh, D.w.w., Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania; S. Kenneth
Thurman, Ed.D., Assistant Professor, Temple University; and Valaida walker,
former DPW Commissioner for Mental Retardation in the Southeastern Region.

Highlights of the "Pennhurst Papers” are extracted in Appendix H.
The gist of the Papers is:

"the institution ... has no role, ultimately, and has an

interim role, at best, a responsibility for facilitating"

its own demise.” "Pennhurst, however, is not alone. No

institution is an appropriate form of educational or treat-

ment setting." "Pennhurst is not an adequate facility."

"... as long as Pennhurst continues to exist in any form,

the service delivery structures for retarded citizens in

Southeast Pennsylvania will be less than adequate.”

The authors support their findings by a couple hundred pages of ward

by ward observations of inhumane conditions, care, and inadequate programming.

-6’-

The Commonwealth's experts‘ and Judge Broderick's findings are
strikingly similar. The Commonwealth's "Pennhurst Papers" call for the closing
of Pennhurst by moving all residents into the community by January l, l982,
exceeding Judge Broderick's deadline by one day.

The closing dates symbolize how close the court and the Commonwealth
are on the entire matter. No wonder that Ginny asked during a DPW briefing,

"If the Commonwealth and the plantiffs are in agreement on all the basic principles
and differ only on timing, then why canit we sit down and resolve the differences?”
In fact, Judge Broderick commented on the closeness both in his

opinion and also his order (March l7, l978 Memorandum, Page 3).

"As was pointed out in this court's opinion, the Common—

wealth defendants agreed that the retarded should be re-

moved from Pennhurst and readily admitted that the only

reason that the litigation was necessary was because they

wished to accomplish the closing of Pennhurst as a

residence for the retarded, pursuant to their own schedule

which was vague and indefinite."

Broderick expected a change in the Commonwealth's approach to the case
when you became Governor. Raymond Broderick had a dream of court and Commonwealth
cooperation. It must be hard for him to comprehend. why, he asks, does this

new Governor, a strong and responsible leader, who has compatible visions,

resist, appeal, or seek a stay on every order?

Reason III: Implementing this order will bring improvements at no additional cost
State mental retardation officials agree that it will cost no more
than presently being expended to provide services in small community settings
rather than large rural settings.
Although much more detailed analysis needs to be done, a preliminary
work—up (see Appendix I) by DPW show the cost in the community is less.
Today, we spend $40,000 a year to keep a person at Pennhurst. One

has to continually question whether an absolutely appropriate program for even

_ 7 _

the person with greater than average needs should cost $40,000, the average
cost!

This is a problem which is not being adequately addressed. Frank
Beal recognized the problem:

"The ever increasing costs of an institutional program

which every year serves fewer people limits our ability

to adequately finance the community based program which

already serves five times more people and every year

serves more. It is a major objective of the Department

to break this cycle ..." (See chart Appendix J)

This year your administration requested $27 million more for insti-
tutions, which will serve fewer people, and $20 million more for community
programs, which will serve more people. The cycle is yet to be broken.

If newly appropriated dollars are still poured into the institutions,
it must be nearly impossible to switch previously appropriated dollars from the
institutions. Much work will need to be done with the Legislature, the bureau-
cracy, the unions, and the Feds. But it will not cost more! It very well may,
as Broderick believes, cost less.

He may be right if Joyce Z. is any example. Joyce Z. was about to
enter an institution at a cost of $35 a day. Judge Maurice Cohill ordered a
foster family to be paid a similar rate, which is still being paid today. In
contrast, the cost in the institution, five years later has tripled to $l0l
per day. Predictably, Joyce's abilities are flourishing, an event which would
not have occurred in the institution, at a $24,000 annual savings per year to
Pennsylvania's taxpayers.

The plantiffs have done some preliminary fiscal comparisons of the

‘ costs to serve the plantiff class in the community or at the institution. The

Commonwealth has yet to estimate the costs in the community or attempt such a
comparison. The plantiffs project significantly better care and training at

less cost to the taxpayer.

_ 3 _

The challenge is not how to raise more revenue; it is how to use
current revenues in an effective and cost efficient way.

It is incredible that such basic fiscal planning has not been under-
taken by the Department. The Department doesn't seem to care about using the
taxdollar more efficiently. Nor does the Department have the ability to plan
fiscally, programmatically, politically for the conversion from the institution
to the community model.

The DPN performance on this issue diverges greatly from your Inaugural
pledge to the people, "we promise a frugality — that insists on a dollars worth

of service for every tax dollar spent." ($40,000 per Pennhurst resident per

year!)

Reason IV: Implementing the court order is the right action to take

A. The Special Master is needed to make the system work.

The Commonwealth, the Court, and the plantiffs agree on what is best
for the residents of Pennhurst. The court is merely pushing the Commonwealth
to do what it all along has wanted to do but was unable to do. V

There is evidence that the court's power is needed to make the system
advance. One good example is case management, a necessity for individual
planning and monitoring. The court has ordered and is overseeing changes in
the case management system. The changes are those proposed by the Department.

It is generally conceded that the current case management system
does not work well and that state law, which places this function on county
governments, is being ignored. The Department recognized both of these facts
and developed position papers to correct these problems.

After the Special Master adopted the Department's position and got

the court to order this change, county officials finally began to comply with

‘the law.

_.9 _

The Special Master and the court did what the Commonwealth had been
unable to do since l973 when it was proposed to affix a single point of responé
sibility for securing services.

Other needed changes are following. Individually adaptive wheelchairs
are being provided. Individual habilitation plans are being written. Federal
funding is being sought. Monitoring mechanisms to assure quality are being
developed. Comprehensive planning is occurring. Suitable living arrangements
are being planned.

Each of these activities, and others supervised by the Special Master,
are mandated by state statute. For years, the Department and the county programs
had not fulfilled these legislated responsibilities. Because of the court's
and Special Master's clout, these crucial activities now happen.

The MH/MR Act also requires citizen participation in decision-making
at all levels of the system. Repeatedly, the state has charged that the Judge
and the Master are accountable to no one. Ironically, the court officials may
be more accountable than Department officials to the public's views.

when the Special Master attempted to propose the plan to move
children with only a court hearing and no public hearing, there was a massive
outcry. Five lengthy court hearings were required to hear all the testimony.

Scores of letters were written. Dozens of reporters covered the events. Many

people expressed their views in a demonstration.

In contrast, the Department sets major policy on a daily basis,
without even the interested parties aware that the issue is being discussed.
The public's views, contrary to the Act, are almost never heard.

On July 3rd, l979, Secretary Helen O'Bannon, acknowledged the need
for the Special Master's office to exist. She recognized that the Master
could cause desired changes, which the Department had been unable to bring

about. Two weeks later, the Secretary instructed that a motion be filed to

_ 10 _

put the Special Master out of business.

Perhaps Helen does not understand that the Department's failures
are long-standing. She will learn that these are not momentary lapses. The
Department has a disgraceful history of brutalizing retarded residents by
failing to follow state law. The Federal court moved only to fill the void,
caused by the Department's inaction.

Having abandoned its Pennhurst Dispersal Plan on March 20, l979, the
Department does not now have a plan to move Pennhurst residents to community
programs. when the plan existed, the Department had only very limited
objectives, which were never achieved.

I The Federal court and Special Master are critically needed to make

the system work!

B. Judge Broderick's legal findings are just

Earlier, I challenged the facts in the Commonwealth's brief to the
Court of Appeals. Now, I question the broad legal assertions.

Pennsylvania contended that no legal rights were violated. Is it
possible that Pennhurst's life-threatening, health—weakening, regression-
causing environment is "legal"?

Broderick recognized in his Opinion (page_57),

"No constitutional mandate has been called to our attention

which would require a state to provide habilitation for its

retarded citizens. However, whenever a state accepts

retarded individuals into its facilities, it cannot create

or maintain those facilities in a manner which deprives those

individuals of the basic necessities of life. In the case

of the retarded, this constitutes an obligation to provide

them with minimally adequate habilitation.”

The Commonwealth disputes this. In its view, institutionalized
citizens can be deprived of the basic necessities of life; no minimal level

of habilitation must be provided. Pennhurst's history reflects this policy

and its inhumane consequences.

- 11 _

Broderick found it is discriminatory and unlawful under the Consti-
tution and federal statute to unnecessarily seperate and provide less than
minimally adequate services. The Commonwealth opposed this finding.

Individuals at Pennhurst should not be seperated simply because they
are retarded; nor should these individuals be denied services solely because
they are segregated.

In spite of its attornies' views, Pennsylvania has already demon-
strated that retarded persons of all ability levels can benefit from community
services. They need not be segregated!

On May l0, l978, you said it so well:

"I believe the best atmosphere is created in a loving home.

And that is where we ought to concentrate-—on enabling

individuals to live in their own home and neighborhood.

where this isn't possible or desirable, then it is best

for people to be able to live in a setting where they are

part of a community in which they can participate."

Segregation of retarded people into seperate and inadequate settings is not
tolerable.

“Broderick held that residents of state institutions have both an
eighth and fourteenth amendment Right To Be Free From Harm. You know the misery
caused by injury, death, abuse, and neglect in our state institutions. You need
to know that the Commonwealth argued that Pennhurst's citizens are not entitled
to be free from harm. Historically, they have not been free from harm. If the
Pennsylvania Justice Department prevails, they will never be free from harm!

Broderick wrote: I

“it is abundantly clear that the Mental Health and Mental

Retardation Act, 50 P.S. Section 4201 §t_§gg,, grants to

the retarded in Pennsylvania the statutory right to minimally

adequate habilitation.“

It was abundantly clear to Judge Maurice Cohill in Joyce Z.. It was

abundantly clear to dozens of other Pennsylvania Judges. It was abundantly

clear even to Pennsylvania Justice Department attornies, who did not appeal

_Jgygg;§L. It was not clear to the Commonwealth's attornies who combat this

_ 12 _

finding in Pennhurst.
However, in the first such case to be argued at the Pennsylvania

Supreme Court, in Re: Joseph Schmidt, the Justice Department contends that the

l966 MH/MR Act guarantees a right to:

"adequate habilitation services that such individual
requires"

and that the Court has the duty to order:

"the County MH/MR program to develop a more appropriate,
less restrictive, community based residential placement."

_ why does the state oppose the statute-based Right to Habilitation in
Pennhurst, while completely supporting the finding in other cases? The contra-
diction is inexplicable!

During a briefing, Ginny asked why the Commonwealth appealed to the

Third Circuit Court. The (acting) Deputy Secretary answered, "for legal and
technical reasons”. She added, "The program officevdid not recommend appealing“.

' Pennhurst has produced the predicament for some Commonwealth officials,
who believe that the ruling is right for retarded people but not legally sound.
A byproduct is the succession of legal arguments which do not represent our
program's goals.

. I suppose this is how some attornies work. A good attorney might not

be embarrassed to make these arguments; but, a good person would be ashamed.

Conclusion: The Thornburgh opportunity to contribute

Forever, the service delivery system for retarded citizens will need
improvements. Your election drastically raised expectations of real advances.

Ironically, Raymond Broderick, raised expectations in a similar way
during his campaign for Governor in l970. To his credit, Broderick advocated
long ago (see Appendix K) the very same ideals, now embodied in his Pennhurst

ruling. Mr. Broderick is attempting to do something significant and lasting

Q‘

..]3..

's._ I

for Pennsylvania's retarded citizens. Dick, now it is your turn!

You have an opportunity to avoid suffering for thousands. You couldi
prevent the revisiting of "snake pits" and "hell holes" of the recent past.

You could cleanly stop "warehousing" of human beings. You can give hope to
fellow parents, who are concerned about their son/daughter's future, when they
can no longer care for them.

You can lead the nation by setting an example of how to serve retarded
citizens. Pennsylvania was the first state to operate institutions; it can be
the first state to end this unnecessary segregation. A

These are opportunities which are not likely to reoccur for decades.

They certainly will not reoccur during your term of office.

I urge you to reexamine the Commonwealth's opposition to the Pennhursts

ruling and its historical relationship to incarceration or services for retarded
people. I will help in any possible way.

I Only attitudes within the government prevent an incredibly constructive
use of the Pennhurst ruling. In six months, not one Office of Mental Retardation
official has remarked positively about this nationally hailed decision. The
staff agree with the orders (like the case management reform) but fight them
totally.

In a way, I'm reminded of the Vietnam war. we know the "enemy".
we strike at the "enemy". But, we have a tough time remembering or explaining
why we are mijed in this conflict.

Stop appealing and start vigorously implementing the Pennhurst
decision! The order is both cost efficient and consistent with Thornburgh
and Commonwealth policy. And it is just and needed.

Sincerely,

54/

Robert Nelkin
