HARRISBURG—Welfare Sec-

‘ retary He 1 e n e Wohlgemuth

was aware of “excessive use
of restraints,” but didn’t
realize until recently that
U-"K

cages were used to confine
mentally retarded patients,
one of her top aides said to-
dav.

. commis-
sioiei ’ eita retardation,
said he had told Mrs. Wohlge-
muth of ‘cages used to re-
strain the severely retarded
at Polk‘ State School and Hos-
pital following his inspection
last fall. '

“We talked about’ the de-
humanization of patients but I
don‘t recall, nor does Mrs.

cages was brought into the
discussion.” Goldman said.
Mrs. Wohlgemuth, after re-
ceiving a report last week
from the Pennsylvania Asso-
ciation for Retarded Children
(PARC) and her own inspec-
tion tour, fired Dr. James Mc-
Clelland, superintendent of the

Venango County institution, for '-

“cruel and inhumane” treat-
ment of patients. .

Goldman said he believed
Mrs. Wohlgemuth wanted to
carefully study the conditions
at Polk and document the find-
ings before any action against
Mcclclland was taken.

Noting the public support
which has mounted in opposi-
tion to McClelland’s dismissal,
Goldman said:

“If !\lLs_. \l'ohlegem'iit.h'_11a
enough Qii®’“t’o“‘i‘ir‘é"ﬁiii1 now

‘based on the information she '

received in the r e p o rt and
from her own personal inspec-

-ti n, she would have had the
ﬁlast fall to take the same
s. on bad she been aware of

the conditions as she now ‘

knows them.”

Goldman also noted the '

wood-slat cages used at Polk
have replaced “rail and bar"

enclosures which he found in _.
.-his inspection last year. '

“That’s basically the only
difference, but the two meth-
ods serve the same purpose

. and Mrs. Wohlgemuth consid-
ers both as excessive use of
1 restraints,” Goldman said. 4
