         <head>History</head>
         <p>First formed in 1951, the Allegheny County Chapter of the Pennsylvania Association for
        Retarded Children (ACC-PARC) was established as a grassroots organization comprised of the
        parents of people with disabilities. Operating under the name "the Greater Pittsburgh
        Association of Parents and Friends of the Mentally Retarded," this organization adopted a
        mission to "promote the general welfare of mentally retarded children of all ages
        everywhere." In 1956, the association reached non-profit status and changed its name to the
        Allegheny County Chapter of the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children (ACC-PARC) in
        order to reflect its affiliation with the statewide advocacy organization. In 1963, ACC-PARC
        was comprised of over 1,000 active members.</p>
         <p> To fulfill its mission, ACC-PARC created a number of services to assist people with
        disabilities and their families, including diagnostic clinics, education and vocational
        training, community centers, ongoing research and advocacy efforts, counseling, and
        recreational activities. Counseling services offered by ACC-PARC often consisted of
        residential and educational referrals, case screenings, and care recommendations. ACC-PARC's
        advocacy efforts supported the association's vocational training programs centered on
        instructing people with disabilities how to perform tasks and become contributors in the
        workforce. ACC-PARC also chartered buses to facilitate site visits for the families of
        people with disabilities. In addition to providing ongoing services, ACC-PARC also regularly
        organized internal conventions to assess ongoing needs of people with disabilities in the
        region and regularly offered informative programs throughout the year.</p>
         <p> To oversee and direct these activities, ACC-PARC was led by elected officers, a board of
        directors, and various committees, including Residential Care, State Affairs, Personnel, and
        Membership. Together with elected officers and board members, ACC-PARC's activities were
        also executed by the association's personnel, which included an executive director.</p>
         <p> The aspect of ACC-PARC's daily activities most represented in these records are the
        efforts of the association to investigate the treatment of people with disabilities at
        residential care facilities in Western Pennsylvania during the 1960s and 1970s. Prompted by
        informal reports of mistreatment, ACC-PARC committee members developed a grassroots strategy
        to investigate the living conditions of people with disabilities at care facilities
        throughout the region. Overseen by staff member, Bob Nelkin, a small team of ACC-PARC
        members harnessed leads and reports to inform both announced and unannounced visits to care
        facilities such as Western State School and Hospital, the Polk Center, the Ridgeview Center,
        and the Highland Park Center. The leads and reports received by ACC-PARC members often
        originated from both the parents of residents as well as residential care workers. The
        visitation teams paid particular attention to residents' living conditions, facility
        staffing data, sanitary conditions, disciplinary practices, and treatment strategies.
        Recording their observations directly following their visit, the visitation team then
        generated formalized notes and reports that reflected their findings. Throughout the course
        of their visits, the visitation teams discovered that various facilities throughout the
        region employed the use of strait jackets, restraints, isolation rooms, cattle prods, and
        other abuses that violated the residents' human rights.</p>
         <p> With their observations in hand, ACC-PARC members exposed the inadequacies they discovered
        by opening communications with a number of entities, including local government legislators,
        the secretary of the Pennsylvania State Department of Public Welfare (DPW) and members of
        the local media. In adopting this strategy, ACC-PARC members worked to expose adverse living
        conditions of people with disabilities in order to affect legislative change that either
        terminated inadequate care facilities or instituted reform in resident care and staffing.</p>
         <p> During his tenure, Bob Nelkin served as associate director of ACC-PARC under executive
        director Chuck Peters and oversaw the organization's various initiatives, including the
        residential care facility site visits, the Alternatives to Institutions initiative, the
        Community Living Arrangement program, and other disability advocacy activities. In this
        role, Nelkin often corresponded closely with ACC-PARC members, the Pa. State Department of
        Public Welfare, and local government leaders in order to advance ACC-PARC initiatives.</p>
         <p> The chief resident care facilities visited by the team of ACC-PARC members were the Polk
        Center and the Western State School and Hospital. In some cases, the visitation teams
        discovered human rights violations such as the use of wooden cages, battery prods,
        straightjackets, and other restraints. Throughout the early 1970s, ACC-PARC members
        discovered and exposed inadequate living conditions of residents at the Polk Center. The
        state of living conditions at Polk as exposed by ACC-PARC visitation team prompted the
        secretary of the Department of Public Welfare, Helene Wohlgemuth, to make an impromptu visit
        to the care facility. The conditions she witnessed prompted her to call for the immediate
        resignation of the Polk Center's superintendent, Dr. James H. McClelland, Jr. The
        organization's efforts to raise awareness of these conditions prompted an improvement in
        resident care, including the termination of the use of cages.</p>
         <p> The ACC-PARC visitation team turned their attention to living conditions at the Western
        State School and Hospital (WSSH) throughout the early 1970s. Of primary concern to ACC-PARC
        members and other visitation task force members were the overcrowded conditions they
        discovered at the WSSH. As a result of their investigations, ACC-PARC associate executive
        director, Bob Nelkin published an essay "Death: A Way of Life," that shed light on the
        recent deaths of WSSH residents caused by staffing deficiencies, negligence, and
        mistreatment. ACC-PARC's partnership with Washington County Coroner Farrell Jackson sparked
        a formal joint visitation task force team comprised of mental health professionals in 1974.
        The notes and reports generated by this task force as well as ACC-PARC visitation team
        members did much to raise awareness across the state of the deficiencies at WSSH. In
        addition to reporting and publicizing the adverse conditions at WSSH, ACC-PARC also engaged
        in legal battles in order to stymie any court attempts to mandate the admission of new
        residents to WSSH.</p>
         <p> In keeping with the mission of their advocacy efforts in Western Pa., ACC-PARC members
        closely followed the course of a 1974 federal class action lawsuit filed against the
        Pennhurst State School and Hospital, a residential care facility for the intellectually
        disabled in Spring City, Pa. Referred to as Halderman vs. Pennhurst State School and
        Hospital, this case argued that the deplorable living conditions of residents at Pennhurst
        was in violation of the Pa. Mental Health/Mental Retardation Act of 1966 as well as the
        Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Decisions in both the state district (1977) and circuit
        courts (1979) mandated the closure of Pennhurst and the dispersal of residents to smaller
        community living facilities. ACC-PARC ardently supported this decision to remove people with
        disabilities from institutions such as Pennhurst in favor of alternative living arrangements
        such as group homes and community living arrangements. As a consequence, ACC-PARC members
        under the direction of Bob Nelkin sustained pressure on state leaders, including Governor
        Dick Thornburgh, to implement court orders. In 1981, the United State Supreme Court ruled
        that it could not mandate the dispersal of Pennhurst residents due to the fact that it could
        not order state officials to observe state laws. Due to this decision, Pennhurst was not
        closed until December of 1987. Despite this, the Halderman vs. Pennhurst decision still set
        a precedent that people with disabilities had the right to live in community. In addition to
        mandating the dispersal of residents, the presiding judge also ordered that reports be
        conducted to document the adjustment of Pennhurst residents to community living
        arrangements.</p>
         <p> As a result of their visits to the residential care facilities such as WSSH and the Polk
        Center, ACC-PARC began to advocate for community living arrangements as a viable alternative
        to institutionalization for people with disabilities. Members embraced debates surrounding
        zoning for these smaller community living arrangements and underscored the approach of these
        group homes to cultivate skills among residents.</p>
         <p> In 1981, ACC-PARC complied with its parent organization's name change and became the
        Association for Retarded Citizens (ARC) of Allegheny County. In 1992, the organization once
        again followed the lead of its umbrella entity and became the Arc Allegheny. Arc Allegheny
        was later combined with the Arc of Beaver County to become the Arc of Greater Pittsburgh. As
        of the writing of this finding aid, the Arc of Greater Pittsburgh, the Arc of Westmoreland
        County, the ACHIEVA Support, and the ACHIEVA Family Trust were children organizations of
        ACHIEVA.</p>

                     <p>A letter sent to Charles Peters about the Nancy W. situation at Polk State School
                and Hospital. Meador agrees that it is inappropriate to restrict communications
                between residents and their families, and says that this right will be included on
                the "Bill of Rights" for individuals with developmental and intellectual
                disabilities. Meador also states that he will instruct Dr. McClelland to review and

                  <p>This subseries consists of records that document the sustained efforts of ACC-PARC
              members to investigate, discover, and expose the human rights violations witnessed at
              WSSH. Records contained in this subseries include WSSH policies, board of trustee
              resolutions, case files, reports, visitation team notes, correspondence, meeting
              minutes, and news clippings. Worthy of note are the case files, correspondence,
              meeting minutes, and reports that demonstrate the inadequate state of living
              conditions at WSSH. Case file records include information gathered by ACC-PARC and its
              allies to investigate into death of WSSH residents. Aggregated by Bob Nelkin and the
              SSH and Interim Care Committee, the records in this subseries were created by various
              entities, including ACC-PARC, the Joint Visitation Team Task Force, WSSH staff, and
              community advocates.</p>
                  <p> In addition, this subseries also contains files pertaining to various topics at
              WSSH, including Act 75a implementation, construction and expansion records, the Right
              to Education, and electroshock therapy. This subseries also contains copies of
              newspaper and magazine articles written to shed light on both the adverse living
              conditions and deaths at WSSH.</p>

                  State School and Hospital, responding to his March 7th letter to Charles Peters.
                  Thornburgh thanks Hiltner for his cooperation but insists that unannounced visits
                  must also apply to individual residents, if due to a family request.</p>

                  concerned that these units will be permanent rather than transitional.</p>

                  <p>This subseries is comprised of records that document the ongoing efforts of ACC-PARC
              members to investigate the living conditions of people with disabilities at the Polk
              Center. Internal policy documents, case files, reports, correspondence, visitation
              team records, press releases, Polk newsletters, and news clippings. The reports in
              this subseries shed light on living conditions at the Polk Center and originate from
              both internal and external sources, including the Polk superintendent, ACC-PARC
              members, and the American Association of Mental Deficiency. Correspondence in this
              subseries documents Bob Nelkin and the ACC-PARC's efforts to expose understaffing and
              inadequate living conditions at the Polk Center. These conditions included the use of
              cages and restraints. Also documented in the correspondence are investigations into
              resident deaths at Polk.</p>
                  <p> Worthy of note are an aggregate of correspondence received by Helene Wohlgemuth,
              secretary of the Department of Public Welfare, in response to her decision to fire Dr.
              James McClelland from his position as superintendent of the Polk Center (1973-1976).
              In addition to Wohlgemuth's decision, correspondents also often addressed their stance
              on the use of cages in their letters. Wohlgemuth gave these files to Bob Nelkin. Also
              included in this subseries is a copy of the notification letter sent to Dr. McClelland
              as well as a report of conditions following his dismissal.</p>

                  Hospital, to Herbert W., a parent of a Polk resident. McClelland addresses the
                  issue of telephone communications with Nancy W., Mr. W.'s daughter, and resident
                  communications in general. McClelland makes an exception for Nancy but says he can
                  not make any promises about access for all Polk residents.</p>

                        <p>A letter from Robert Sanford, president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society, to
                  Governor Milton J Shapp regarding the need for an independent investigation into
                  the state programs for individuals with developmental and intellectual
                  disabilities. Sanford blames the firing of Dr. James McClelland on the state's
                  inability to establish and administer uniform guidelines and provide adequate
                  funding for the care of individuals with developmental and intellectual
                  disabilities.</p>

                        <p>A letter from Mrs. D. L. Thanos, the sister of a Polk State School and Hospital
                  resident, to Secretary Helene Wohlgemuth regarding the firing of Dr. James
                  McClelland as superintendent of Polk. Thanos believes that Wohlgemuth acted too
                  hastily, without proper knowledge of the needs of the residents of Polk State
                  School and Hospital. Thanos also touches upon the problems of overcrowding and
                  funding at Polk State School and Hospital.</p>

                        <p>The transcript of an editorial broadcast by WWSW Executive Vice President and
                  General Manager Charles H. Warner. Warner believes that the actions of Secretary
                  Helene Wohlgemuth were hasty and suggests that Wohlgemuth knew of the cages at
                  Polk State School and Hospital before her visit.</p>

                  feasibility of foster home placement for Michael W., an individual with
                  intellectual and developmental disabilities. Anderson states that Michael W. has

                  group home. Anderson credits Bob Nelkin for giving him information about foster

                  <p>This subseries is comprised of records such as correspondence, news clippings, and
              various reports that document the advocacy efforts of ACC-PARC on behalf of the
              intellectually disabled residents at other various care facilities in Western Pa.
              Facilities represented in this subseries include the Cresson and Ebensburg Centers,
              the Highland Park Center, the Mountaintop School, the Pleasant Manor, the Ridgeview
              Center, the Robinson Development Center, Selinsgrove State School and Hospital, and
              the Stillmeadow School. Worthy of note are those records pertaining to the Highland
              Park Center, which document efforts by ACC-PARC to expose and eradicate the
              maladaptive behavior programming at this facility. This treatment plan included the
              use of cattle prods and physical restraints on people with disabilities.</p>

               <p>This series is comprised of three scrapbooks that document ACC-PARC activities and
            programs throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The first scrapbook documents ACC-PARC
            activities and initiatives throughout 1966-1967, including benefits, workshops, awards,
            fund drives, presentations, and advocacy efforts. In particular, this scrapbook
            highlights ACC-PARC efforts to raise public awareness of the abilities of people with
            disabilities to work. The second scrapbook dates to 1972 and is comprised of news
            clippings that document deaths of residents at the Ridgeview Center. The third scrapbook
            details the Melwood Preschool program (1974-1975) for the people with disabilities and
            includes class photos, class activities, and class field trips.</p>
