HARRISBURG—Welfare Secretary Helene Wohlgemuth was aware of “excessive use of restraints,” but didn't realize until recently that cages were used to confine mentally retarded patients, one of her top aides said today. .	_	__
—^rlaward Gola’maj). commissioned 16t ThemaTretardation, said he had told Mrs. Wohlgemuth of cages used to restrain the severely retarded at Polk State School and Hospital following his inspection last fall.
? “We talked about the humanization of patients but I don't recall, nor does Mrs. Wohlgemuth, whether the word

cages was brought into the discussion,” Goldman said.
Mrs. Wohlgemuth, after receiving a report last week from the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children (PARC) and her own inspection tour, fired Dr. James McClelland, superintendent of the Venango County institution, for “cruel and inhumane” treatment of patients.
Goldman said he believed Mrs. Wohlgemuth wanted to carefully study the conditions at Polk and document the findings before any action against McClelland was taken.
Noting the public support which has mounted in opposition to McClelland’s dismissal, Goldman said:
“If Mrs. Wohlegemuth enough ^ni^TO“iittmi'm now based ou the information she ' . received in the report and from her own persona! inspection, she would have had the {guT>)last fall to take the same action had she been aware of the conditions as she now knows them.”
Goldman also noted the wood-slat cages used at Polk have replaced “rail and bar” enclosures which he found in his inspection last year.
“That’s basically the only difference, but the two methods serve the same purpose . and Mra. Wohlgemuth considers both as excessive use of restraints,” Goldman said.
