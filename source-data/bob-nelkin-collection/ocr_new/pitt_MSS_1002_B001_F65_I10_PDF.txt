VISIT TO CHILDREN’S REHABILITATION CENTER, BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, FRIDAY, DEC.29, 1972
ACC-PARC - Team Members: Virginia Thornburgh, Chairman; Bob Nelkin, Staff Member
Purpose of the visit was to determine how an employee’s strike at Children’s Rehabilitation Center affected the quality of the care of the residents. In keeping with the committee policy this was an unannounced visit.
On arriving at the gate we were greeted by several of the striking members. The strikers belong to the Service Employees International Union out of New York.
They explained that all workers Including child care, laundry workers, kitchen help were paid at the same rate, $1.90 per hour. There Is limited Incentive. A worker with five year's experience Is paid the same as a nowlee child care worker with two week’s experience.
The striking workers were seeking a raise to $2.20 per hour. They wore also seeking a clarification on the chain of command.
Our purpose was to visit the residents. Our request was answered negatively by Mrs. Willison, R.N., assistant to Mrs. May. Mrs. Willison refused us admission upon the orders of Mr. Themes E. Bridge, President.
Wo drove to Bakerstown and met with Mr. Bridge. His answers were abrupt. In response to our request: "Better off If you come after the first of the year.” When Mrs. Thornburgh asked him what would be the difference between now or after the first of the year, Mr. Bridge said: "I have nothing further to say to you.” He claimed that staffing was at B0< and they hoped to have It at I001& soon. It should be noted that Children's Rehabilitation Center has hod other problems with employees over the last few yeors.
