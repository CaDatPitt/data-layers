Dear Governor:
As a concerned resident of Venango County, I wish to protest the unfair and unjust critism of one of our states* and nations’ BETTER residential facilities for the mentally retarded — namely Polk State School and Hospital.
The degrading manner in which Secretary Helene Wohlgemuth fired Superintendent James H. McClelland, Jr., M. D. has had a demoralizing effect not only on the staff at the school but more importantly on the residents and their families.
I find it very frightening to live in a State where one ill-informed appointed official has this kind of power. Power to disturb thousands of lives. I find it doubly hard to believe that you as Governor would sanction such action without conducting an investigation and consulting with medical experts.
As a professional staff member of a Venango County Health and Welfare agency, I question Mrs. Wohlgemuth's qualifications for evaluating the care and treatment of the severely mentally retarded and physically handicapped. For Mrs. Wohlgemuth to rely on the emotionally biased opinion of a non-professional organization (P.A.R.C.) is unjust and unfair.
I urge you to conduct a complete investigation into this matter.
Sincerely,
CC: Secretary Wohlgemuth Senator Frame Representative Kahle
