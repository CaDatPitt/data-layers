There Is
no better administrator
in any of our
institutions than Dr. McClelland—
There is no administrator In your employ that more highly regarddcd then Dr. McClelland —
There is no more conscientious administrator
we If ar e is than
Dr. McClelland -*•
When he was the chief physician In the Polk School there was no doctor more reveered than Dr. McClelland —
His patients and the attendants loved him --
I know, because my son has been In the Polk State School for 26 yearsl
Aside from the days when he has been permitted to come home for the vacation days, my wife and I have visited our son
•every two weeks since 1947.
We have thrown parties for our son’s room both at Christmas time and on his yearly birthday all these years. We are acquainted with his room attendants and with many of the mental deficient patients.
When the patients become unruly, there are only three ways to care for them:
Strap them In their beds
2-	put them in a straight jacket
3-	out them in a play pen structure where they are free to exercise thetr arms and legs where they can not cause a disturbance*
Why did you call them ” Cages ” liking them to some animal, why did 98u/caI 1 them play pens?
•
These play pens have been In use for many years--they are not cages In the sense you call them - they are the best thing that can be done for those patients who are unruly*
*
Surely your conscience will bother you all your life by humiliating a man whose character has been above reproach in directing the affairs of Polk School
b
If It is politics --•* it is the ^ors^t form that I have ever encountered.	S-
