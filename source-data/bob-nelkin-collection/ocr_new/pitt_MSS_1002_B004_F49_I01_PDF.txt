Dear Frank,
z
Enclosed is a report by the PARC Residential Services Committee concerning & recent visit to Ebensburg State School. The conditions found at that institution were quite alarming, particularly in the areas of: programming; drug abuse; restriction of movement by residents; staff attitude toward and knowledge about \ residents; clothing; medical and dental care; and privacy.
In light of the serious problems outlined in the PARC report, as well as observations made in a confidential report by several visitors from out-of-state, we are hopeful that you will read the material in its entirety and advise this Association of the Department’s plans for correction.
Copies of these materials have also been forwarded to Ford Thompson, Deputy Secretary of Central Region.
We look forward to hearing from you in this regard.
Sincerely,
Elsie Schmidt, President
Marlene Burda, Chairman PARC Residential Services Committee
