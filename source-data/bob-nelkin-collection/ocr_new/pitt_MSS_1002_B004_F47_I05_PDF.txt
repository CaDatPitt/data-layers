Dear Secretary Colautti:
On behalf of the Association for Retarded Citizens, which is representing the mentally retarded residents of Ebensburg and Cresson Centers, we request you supply us with a copy of a survey conducted by Dr. Jay Resnick of dental services at those two institutions.
We intend to review this document as part of our own investigation into crisis conditions in dental care at these facilities.
We appreciate your continued cooperation and look forward to receiving a copy of the report soon.
Si ncerely,
Teddi Leiden
President
