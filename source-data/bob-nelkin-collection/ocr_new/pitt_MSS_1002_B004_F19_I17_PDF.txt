Dear Hr. McClelland,	\,0^^
I was shocked to hear over the news media the action that was taken by the SecjS retary of Health. As you knew, I have been connected with Polk School going on 13 years now, having my daughter Judy as a member of that instituion. I could not be more pleased with the efficiency, care, and allaround conditions of Polk and the way you have administered the school.
I have also been through the school and have seen the types you have to put up with. I think it takes much more of an understanding of day-to-day life with all types of retardation than the Secretary could possibly have, to have taken such an abrupt action.As for dehumanizing patients, I myself saw what could hardly be called humans at all, mere vegetables, abandoned, forgotten by the world, and then unceremoniously dumped on the doorstep of Polk.
Just what alternative does the Secretary have to contain certain individuals, protect them from violence from others etc.? I have seen the dedication of the personnel and know that it comes through your adminintrarion. In all the years Judy has been with you, there never has been a time that I doubted that she was getting the best care available at all times.
, I think the action taken by the Secretary has been most unfair and wish I were in a better position to appeal to the Higher-Ups to immediately rescind yesterday’s order.
If this letter can be used to better your cause in any way, please feel free to use it. If there is any other way I can help you, please call on me at any time. I think you have done a tremendous job at Polk, and I for one, am very grateful.
Yours Sincerely,
