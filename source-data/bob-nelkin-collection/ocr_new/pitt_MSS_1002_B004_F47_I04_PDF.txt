Ms. Teddi Leiden President PENNSYLVANIA ASSOCIATION	FOR	
RETARDED CITIZENS 1500 North Second Street Harrisburg, Pennsylvania	17102	
Dear Ms. Leiden:		
This is in response to your letter of January 16, 1979, regarding the recent dental review at Cresson and Ebensburg Centers.
As you have requested, I am providing you with copies of the initial reviews conducted by Dr. Jay Resnick. In addition, I am also providing copies of the follow-up reviews conducted by the Department of Health. The latter reports have not been officially accepted by this Department; they are under review at this time.
As Mr. Peter Polloni and Mr. Ford Thompson have indicated to you and other members of your Association, this Department has already acted upon many of the recommendations in both reports. These actions include the following:
1.	New dental equipment has been requisitioned for both facilities.
2.	Requests to fill additional professional dental service positions have been sent to the Office of Budget and Administration.
3.	Oral dental examinations are being provided to al 1 Ebensburg and Cresson residents by dental staff from other State facilities. It is anticipated that the Ebensburg screening will be concluded by February 9; the Cresson screening will be completed by the end of February. Any need for immediate or emergency restoration will occur simultaneously.
Although the above actions have already been taken, additional steps may be taken; subsequent actions will be consistent with the findings in No. 3 above.
Ms. Teddi Leiden
February 6, 1979
