Dear Judge Cohill:
It has come to ray attention that you will be hearing the case of Joyce	from St. Francis Catchment Area on October 9, 1974.
Miss	is physically handicapped and MH/MR is suggesting that
she should be admitted as a resident to Western State School and Hospital.
I would like to appear before the court on that date and present information about the appropriateness of any placement at that institution, information that might help you in your determination.
Sincerely yours,
J. 1 Kci
