Dear Govenor Shaop;
i
I am a senior at Edinboro State College and have visited Polk State School and Hospital on several occasions, and am extremely interested $n the field of education.
I believe Dr. McClelland to be a person concerned with each and every patient at the sohool. I believe McClelland to be a man of integrity, concerned and devoted to Polk.
’ • • ■>
I am not familiar with either Ms. Wohlgemuth or
r
Ms. Elkin’s qualifications for passing judgement in this case. However, I do feel that the firing of McClelland and the accusationd against his staff were unfair.
•	;	_ If
Sincerely,
Sarah Elliston
I have also sent this letter to Mrs. Wohlgemuth, state secretary for the Department of Public Welfare.
