APPENDIX "C"
THE STORY OF JOYCE Z.
The story of Joyce Z. reveals a person who has escaped the system.
At age 9, Joyce drowned in a backyard swimming pool. Joyce was revived by first-aid from the brink of death. However, Joyce suffered severe brain damage, which caused her to be dependent in every way.
At age 13, Joyce's rehabilitative stay at Pittsburgh's Home for
Crippled Children ended because she could make no more progress. Child welfare and MH/MR officials petitioned Juvenile Court for a commitment of Joyce to Western State School and Hospital, a state-run institution.
Ginny Thornburgh, armed with extensive knowledge about Western and
other institutions, informed Judge Maurice Cohill that Joyce's health and safety could not be protected in the institution. Ginny added that the health and safety of the current residents would be less protected by this commitment and further overcrowding.
Ginny's testimony was corroborated by state officials who verified
the overcrowding, under-staffing, and lack of programs. .
Judge Cohill entered an opinion, which is now a basic legal precedent.
Joyce was guaranteed a right to treatment by the 1966 MH/MR Act and the United States Constitution. He found that the institution was unable to provide that required care and treatment.
A foster home was suggested as an alternative to Joyce's institutionalization. The Judge ordered, over the protest of county officials, that a foster home be sought.
County officials interviewed and rejected all 27 families who responded to the ads for Joyce's foster home. One of the families rejected included a nurse who cared for Joyce at the Home for Crippled Children, and her husband, who was a minister.
THE STORY OF JOYCE Z. (con't)
-2-
Not only had the family raised two grown daughters, but the wife was familiar with Joyce's needs and the necessary daily medical procedures to keep Joyce going. These "rejected" candidates for foster parents were further qualified by their unusual dedication and energy.
The Judge found the family to be acceptable. The family found the $4.75 ($2.75/day plus $2.00 allowance) per diem unacceptable. The wife intended to quit her $10,000 a year job to care for Joyce which she felt
i would be a very demanding responsibility.
Judge Cohill was informed that the cost of care in that state institution was $35/day. Cohill ordered the family to be paid $35/day. (Today, five years later, the per diem cost in the institution is $101/day. The foster family still receives $35/day.) The following update demonstrates how Joyce's abilities are flourishing while saving taxpayers $24,000 annually.
Joyce Z. Update - July 1979:
A check on Joyce in July, 1979, reveals significant developmental progress and a loving home. Joyce's foster mother told of progress in all areas including: self-feeding, swallowing regular food, mobility, walking, toilet training, head and trunk control, lower medication doses, response to commands, verbal ability, attention span, and ability to relate to other people. You name it and Joyce has progressed.
According to the foster mother, Joyce now feeds herself almost independently, a major growth in five years. Joyce can take 10 steps independently and walks well with one hand assistance from another person. Joyce's wheelchair, her only means of mobility five years ago, isn't used now.
Joyce had no head or trunk control in 1974. She has it now.
Medication to control seizures made Joyce groggy. The dose has been
successfully and drastically dropped.
4
THE STORY OF JOYCE Z. (con't) -3-
Joyce now holds her urine and coughs to let her foster parents know she has to go to the bathroom. Joyce wet herself constantly when she first entered the foster family.
Best of all the improvements in her life, Joyce avoided entering the impersonal institutional life and instead belongs to a loving and dedicated family. The tender, loving care provided to Joyce is not replace
able and not found in institutions.
APPENDIX "D"
WILLIAM W. SCRANTON - GOVERNOR - (1965)
"Mentally retarded children and adults have for too long been denied maximum opportunity for fullest development of their potential . . . The citizens of our Commonwealth must now be made fully aware of the nature and scope of mental retardation so that local communities can provide the multiple needed services."

RAYMOND P. SHAFER - GOVERNOR - (1970)
"This Administration has publicly announced its commitment to cut through bureaucracy, red tape, heartbreak, and despair with a revolutionary approach, including reducing resident populations at existing institutions for the mentally retarded, placing residential services in the communities where they belong and coordinating these services with the full range of community services.
MILTON J. SHAPP - GOVERNOR - (1977)
"All of these programs, and services make it possible for retarded persons of all ages to live, to work, to learn, and to be part of the community. It is this goal that we will continue to strive toward for every retarded citizen in Pennsylvania."

APPENDIX "F"
IN THE WORDS OF DPW OFFICIALS:
The Governor of Pennsylvania and the Department of Public Welfare are committed to developing and expanding opportunities in the community so that every mentally retarded person in this state can live, work, earn, and enjoy the benefits of living as normally as possible in the community.
The mass "warehousing" of people afflicted with this handicap, in isolated institutions providing only custodial care and little hope for return to their home or community, is no longer an acceptable alternative.
In asking his question, it never occurred to him that cruel and inhumane are adjectives which can well be applied to long-term institutionalization itself. For what can be more dehumanizing than shutting a person up in a world which is limited to a few buildings, or even a few hundred acres of land.
It is not only the physical confinement which is inhumane, but the barriers to the development of skills and abilities which results from long term institutionalization and dependency. For far too long, society and even the so-called professional experts believed that mentally disabled people needed to be isolated from the community. Every person has the rights to live as normally as possible within our communities.
Most people, when they think of group homes, think of the highest functioning retarded living in those homes and the lower functioning needing institutional care. Experience has shown that this is not the case, and even the severely and profoundly retarded can have their residential services provided locally.
The ever-increasing costs of an institutional program, which every year serves fewer people, limits our ability to adequately finance the community-based program which already serves five times more people and each
IN THE WORDS OF DPW OFFICIALS (con't) -2-
year serves more. It is a major objective of the Department to cycle, where the increasing demand of the state hospital system resources needed to develop a quality community program. . .
Only through sound planning and a rational allocation
break this
consumes the
of resources
can the cycle be broken. To facilitate this, I ask that you seriously consider combining the institutional MH/MR and the community MH/MR appropriations.

COMPARISON OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S EXPERTS' REPORT
("THE PENNHURST PAPERS") AND ASSERTIONS BY
COMMONWEALTH ATTORNIES TO COURT OF APPEALS
Justice Department:
But, at bottom, the Eighth Amendment finding cannot be sustained in light of the abundant evidence of the many beneficial programs and services offered to residents. (P. 39)
Department's Experts:
i
Shortage of program staff is evident . . . (P.37)
Although the team visited at various times (early morning, weekdays, weekends and evening) there was little programmatic training by resident life staff observed. (P. 37)
Lack of sufficient programming. (P. 37)
Programs are developed and implemented at the convenience of staff rather than best interest of residents.(P.40)
Clients needing programming worse are denied it. (P. 40)
• *
They do not know how to carry out programs--they are non-stimulating and they are care and custody rather than growth and human potential oriented. (P. 77)
The treatment sample revealed a serious lack of programs and activities for most residents. (P. 77)
The visual scene encountered everywhere--residents idly sitting,mi 11ing, sleeping or behaving in tension-reducing and bizarre manner designed to compensate for the lack of a meaningful social existence. (P. 77)
Particularly irresponsible, is the total lack of weekend activity and the total lack of indoor and outdoor exercise. (P. 77)
A custodial attitude prevails. (P. 142)
COMPARISON OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S EXPERTS' REPORT
- 2 -
(Residents) were receiving zero activity daily. (P. 150)
About 80% of the staff time is taken up in custodial care. (P. 197)
As one enters the cottage, residents are seen milling around, sitting and sleeping on floors, in the hall or the day room. No programming was ever observed. (P. 229)
Once a resident awakens, he or she generally spends the remainder of the day either sitting or laying on the floor or furniture or roaming around the cottage. (P. 239)	(
Pennhurst remains an overcrowded, understaffed institution removed from society with inadequate programming. (P. 5)
An example of such a human warehouse is Pennhurst. (P. 293)
Justice Department:
The rationality of Pennhurst and like facilities is plainly obvious— there are presently no suitable alternatives which provide all of the necessary support and health services which are not provided at Pennhurst (P. 24-25).
Department's Experts:
It is the contention of this review panel that as long as Pennhurst continues to exist in any form, the service delivery structures for retarded citizens in Southeast Pennsylvania will be less than adequate. (P. 301)
The institution, in the opinion of this review panel, has no role, ultimately, and has an interim role, at best, a responsibility for facilitating its own demise. (P. 291)
Justice Department:
The crucial failing of the Court's Eight Amendment analysis is its
failure to identify even one incident of punishment.
COMPARISON OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S EXPERTS' REPORT - 3 -
Department's Experts:
Restraints and seclusion are used for punishment.
Justice Department:
In fact, the client security officer testified that in his seven years at Pennhurst he had witnessed only one incident of patient abuse. (P. 35)
Department's Experts:
While physical abuse was not observed, personal and psychological neglect abound and resident-to-resident injury was found to be common. (P. 77)
While there, more than one resident showed off an injury sustained the day before, and which had required a number of stitches. (P. 96)
Several pools of urine were on the floor and, of the three aides on duty, one was busily and conscientiously attending to a resident who had slipped on urine, causing a rather lengthy gash on his skull. At the time of arrival, 20 minutes had passed, and the physician who had been called had not arrived. Two aides were on break. (P. 143)
A profoundly retarded woman who had blinded herself through years of gouging her eyes (P. 146)
Serious psychological neglect and abuse of the residents, and a serious apathy toward resident-to-resident injuries (P. 155)
In December, 1976 an aide was fired from the Unit following a case in which he had physically abused a resident by "branding" the resident on this unit, . . . dismissal in 1976 for forms of abuse, mostly involving punching,
shoving, tripping, or hitting (P. 198).
APPENDIX "H"
HIGHLIGHTS OF COMMONWEALTH'S EXPERTS' REPORT ON PENNHURST
FEBRUARY 1977 (THE PENNHURST PAPERS)
The authors, Alexander Hersh, S. Kenneth Thurman, and Valaida
Walker, were commissioned by Department of Public Welfare to answer four questions raised by the Department of Justice. The questions concerned: What is the role of the institution? Is an institution an appropriate setting? Is Pennhurst an adequate facility? Can Pennhurst be made an adequate facility?	<
Their answers came in a 306 page report which found:
"The institution . . . has no role, ultimately, and has an interim role, at best, a responsibility for its own demise." "Pennhurst is not an appropriate educational and treatment setting."
"Pennhurst, however, is not alone. No institution is an appropriate form of educational or treatment setting."
"Pennhurst is not an adequate facility." "... as long as Pennhurst continues to exist in any form, the service delivery structures for retarded citizens in Southeast Pennsylvania will be less than adequate."
The report, An Analysis of Pennhurst Center: Its relationship to
Mental Retardation Services in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Region (Fe b ru a ry 1977, Confidential--for Authorized Eyes Only), is both well written and thorough.
The authors recommend:
I.	The closing of Pennhurst by moving all residents into the community by January 1, 1982
A.	No admissions
B.	Implement D.G.S. Project (Act 256)
C.	Counties accomodate 20% of Pennhurst residents per year
D.	Arrange for residents from outside Southeast Pennsylvania
HIGHLIGHTS OF COMMONWEALTH'S EXPERTS' - 2 -
t
u
II.	The development of legislation to provide a mechanism which places funding with the client and puts the responsibility for service clearly with the counties.
A.	Draft legislation by July 1, 1979
B.	Intorduce into General Assembly by January 1, 1980
III.	Development of a plan to make use of existing Pennhurst physical
facility
A.	No additional appropriations for physical renovations
B.	Turn over modular units to Chester County MH/MR by July 1, 1979
C.	By January 1, 1980, submit an alternate use for Pennhurst
In summary the authors found Pennhurst to be "overcrowded, understaffed, institution removed from society with inadequate programming". They found Pennhurst to be "a human warehouse" whose "continued existence was intolerable".
The experts found Pennhurst was based on an antiquated model; providing no opportunities for programs to the clients who live there; isolated from the community at large; breaking up families, providing a tenuous psychological environment, dehumanizing residents, providing no privacy, placing residents in physical danger.
I suppose the "Pennhurst Papers" are secret and suppressed because they refute the Pennsylvania Justice Department's alleged facts and arguments which were made after the report. I guess the Commonwealth's "Pennhurst Papers" have been hidden because they closely parallel the findings and conclusions of Judge Broderick's opinion and order.
