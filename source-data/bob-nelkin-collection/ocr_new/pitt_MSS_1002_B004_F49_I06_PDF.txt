On October 31, 1975, I visited Ebensburg State School and Hospital, Ebensburg, Pa. during the hours of-11:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M. with a colleague of mine

Ebensburg administrators explained that the Intermediate Unit of the Pennsylvania Department of Education rented three or four buildings in the community to which institutionalized children were transported to receive educational programming. These were

I wanted to bring these observations to your attention to see if there is anything that you, or others associated with PARC, can do to begin to rectify this situation. Please let me know if you would like me to furnish you with more specific information regarding my visit, including the name of the facility, or if I can assist you in any other way.
Kindest personal regards.
Very truly yours
