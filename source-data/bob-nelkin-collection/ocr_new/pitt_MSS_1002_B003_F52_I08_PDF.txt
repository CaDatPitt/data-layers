Beccpt developments regarding my daughter Xia V^^HI in oonxeeticn with, her Health* Sducation* and Welfare* All of which interrelate for total growth noeda. These needs created a deep concern* Cue to problems Xis had under observation during her visit horn® for the thrive weeks of the Chrlstnas Holidays* Sens of these problem can be rectified through initiation of changes by th XU. I*a hopeful hese changes can be accomplished without difficulty*
It Is a noted fact Mat has been sitting for (10 hours) a day* For at least 00 XSA3 and a HALF* This practice is neither healthy nor practical if rehnMiiiaticn la the objective* In considering a tired and acting body vill not respond at it* a capacity nor can any potential bo achieved if mselo deterioration has bocc®® fixad.
On hens visit for three weeks of the holiday, Kia would adc to lay after three hours of sitting, As ths days passed* I came to realise she could sit acre erect and seeded more ccmfortahlo after those rests of one hour. Before entering Western Stato Jehool and Hospital* Kim had thigh aprradara which kept her backside from sliding forward alleviating wight off her tailbono* th® rounded shoulders* and the curved spina which in ay opinion have become worse in the- last few years* I could not expect otherwise* Sine®, I Have been infolded pf th® practices of what is overlooked. when profasslonals have an overloaded. situation* Another oversight which sl^it prove valuable nr® th© thigh spreaders eh® outgrew during th® courco of years at Western that were not reordered, They were previously Used as an aid la sitting besides an aid to the hamstrings* Ihis combination included showlderhcoks th® Benni— aion School designed for her** Since the discontinued use and practice of these aid's havebe-coo® questionable and maybe Adding weakness incurrsd from the long hours of sitting c»ntrrb-Lrtlng to her problems of growth,
I have asked after school peraonel to lay Xis in a esxt* periods of th® day* They have Indicated to no a change will be initiated as also with th© additional foodl provided which they have failM to fulfill in the past* As X have asked of the welfare dept. I’n asking the IB* al&n, to take th® sgua® consideration during the course of th® school day* At least on®» duMnig th® aftemooH session this can be aceosspli^hed* possibly utilising that period for co-orllmtion of sotor jaovesseats* If not Clare Burgen ai^it interject a thought in cnoth-er direction* X would liko you to consider also Kim bed always been capable of fetxling self with a fork* She has beccss® very weak in this develorsaent, Bine® only a spoon Is utilised on th® -self feeding progran. As long as supervision la miatained during feeding I give jay; &»s$&3sion to introduce th® .fork* since some form of ths normal living is partef the educational progzaa,
Ccncsming Kim^s dropped wrist* and* th® capability's she has In the us® of her haeds and finger sotor functioti could bo ^>r® pzogrussiw if a wrist retaining b®nd were uso-ad to aid in better control* A daviso of this natui1® haa helped may childaren with th® ssun® difficulty* A devise desired to fit her individual needs would enable her to function with leas difficulty at the sene tiu® positive results of progress can be adiiswd*
