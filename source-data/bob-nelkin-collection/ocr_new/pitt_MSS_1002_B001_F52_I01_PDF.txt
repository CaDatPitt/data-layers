Dear Friends,
I have an 18 year old son who requires 24 hour a day supervision. The choices that we will face in the future are not satisfactory. I can continue to provide 24 hour a day supervision or I can commit him to an understaffed, overcrowded warehouse where he will lead a bleak existence.
I don't like either choice. I'd like my son to enjoy a humane existence and I'd like to be free to live a normal life myself. I'd like him to live close by so that I can watch out for problems and make sure that he is in the kind of place where he will continue to have a decent life even after the family is gone.
On May 24, 110 parents met because they care, too, about where their kids will live when they (parents) die. We found out, during the meeting, that there are parents whose sons and daughters need a residential placement right now! And there is no place-----no place----in Allegheny County for
these children and adults. And, unless we get involved, there will be no place in our community this year or years to come (when our need may be as serious).
We, parents, sent a petition to Secretary of Welfare, Frank Beal, asking him to meet with us. Mr. Beal is responsible for the development of alternatives to institutions in the state. We plan to share with Mr. Beal our present and future needs and our concern that there is no place for our sons/ daughters to go. We will ask him when there will be places available in our community.

Mr. Beal has repeatedly expressed the state’s preference for mentally retarded citizens to live and learn in their home community, rather than institutions. Yet, Allegheny County received state funds to start only one group home last year. Next year, the projection is that Allegheny County will get zero. We don’t understand why.'
We will meet with Mr. Beal at the Downtown Pittsburgh Branch of the YWCA, 4th & Wood Streets, on Saturday morning, June 26th, at 10:00 a.m. We hope you will come. Please bring other parents and friends. Call and invite your state legislators. Get up and tell your need -whether your child is multiply handicapped or mildly retarded - whether your need is immediate or far in the future.
Don't miss this meeting! It will affect your son's/ daughter's future.
