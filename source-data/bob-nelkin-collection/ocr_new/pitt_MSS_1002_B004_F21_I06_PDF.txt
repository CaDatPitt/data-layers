Dear Secretary Wohlgemuth:
I have been intermitently associated with Dr. J. H. McClelland in various capacities since 1960. Many time I have taken students on tour of Polk and several other similar institutions in the state. In past years, I have periodically undertaken research (with parental and institutional approval) from time to time at Polk and at several other State facilities. Please believe my statement that Dr. McClelland is the kindest, most dedicated, and most competent administrator whom I have met in this or many other states in which I have undertaken research or visited on a consultation basis.
As you have pursued your active schedule following appointment by Governor Shapp, I have most often strongly supported many of your efforts. However, in this situation, I feel that you have erred grossly. Probably as the resultant of horribly distorted information.
I urge you to carefully review the basis of your action and re-evaluate the conditions which prompted your dismissal of Dr. McClelland.
Respectfully yours,
and Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Medical Genetics)
