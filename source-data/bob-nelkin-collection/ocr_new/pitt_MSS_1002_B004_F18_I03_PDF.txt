IIARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Pennsylvania Auditor Gen. Robert Casey says he’s learned that juvenile delinquents committed to a rehabilitation center near Philadelphia were being taken to a New Jersey night club supposedly as part of their retraining.
“I can readily understand the need to maintain rehabilitation programs for juveniles, but to spend public money for junkets to expensive night clubs borders on the ridiculous,” he said in a letter to Welfare Secretary Helene Wohlgemuth.
According to Casey, delinquents at the Youth Development Center at Cornwells Heights in Bucks County were taken by
counselors to the I .atin Casino at Cherry Hill, N.J., on six occasions. The tab for meals, transportation and counselor working time came to more than $1,000, he said.
An aide to Mrs. Wohlgemuth responded to Casey: “The information contained in your letter also came to the attention of the secretary. At that time the secretary ordered . . . the practice stopped immediately; second, that an investigation be conducted to determine the_appropriatenes.s of the expenditure of funds for such trips.”
Casey gave this list of night club trips: —Nov. 20, six juveniles and a counselor
dined and caught the Ray Charles show for a cost of $132.52.
—Jan. 22, six juveniles and a counselor, dinner, Jerry Butler show, $137.52.
—Jan. 25, 12 juveniles and live counselors, dinner, Jerry Butler show, $36.92.
—Feb. 15, six juveniles and a counselor, dinner, Temptations and Supremes show, $123.72.
—Feb. 25, the same entertainment foi 10 more juveniles and two counselors, $220.64.
—April 11, 10 juveniles and five counselors, dinner, Al Green show,



$409.92.
