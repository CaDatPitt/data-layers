Notes on Polk Dispersal Meeting - Harrisburg
December 27, 1973
The 10 workers who originally will find domesciIlary placements, will eventually become the Polk Social Service Department. At the present time, Superintendent Columbatto does not have a Social Service Department.
Mr. Poonni made a good point that there are two separate needs: One for a Social Service staff to the stay at Polk and one for the dispersal staff to continually find domesciIlary placements.
Dr. Virginia Washburn of the Health Department said, "Be assured that no one will be admitted unless they are active TB cases."
There are three immediate goals of the Task Force on the Dispersal Plan:
(1)	To insure backup services for Marcy/AVS
(2)	Monitor the program at Marcy/AVS
(3)	To help in the development of the Marcy/AVS Program
Norman Mu I grave and Bob Nelkin, on several occasions, made the point that volunteers cannot continue to monitor. Staff members are needed.
Mr. Columbatto said, "In order for this program to work, I need a high incidence of success."
After the meeting Mr. C. A. Peters suggested that ACC-PARC write a letter on two subjects manning date, programs, backup service^nd punching out a
an additional request for monitoring staff.
The estimates of persons in the areas to be moved, 950 people will come from Allegheny County and 250 from Erie.
Joe Columbatto said, " It’s a moral problem with me." I told Stan Myers I would not be comfortable in leaving this room until I knew that the population at Polk would be reduced.
Approval was given for the move of 50 persons to Marcy. A task force
headed by Chuck Peters was created to discover the needs and problems and monitor.

3. To issue a contract with Allegheny Valley School for housing and program for 40 persons.
Other issues raised: Isherwood - BSUs are not capable of managing cases.
OMR - Concerned about a double move to Marcy and then from Marcy in a short time. Feltoar - Wants to be able to assure parents of the permanance in such a move.
Ken Winograd said, ’’The persons may be correct about the capacity of BSUs to monitor.'-' The Marcy program would be different from other programs because it is not funded through MH/MR. ’We’re on health’s turf’ .”
