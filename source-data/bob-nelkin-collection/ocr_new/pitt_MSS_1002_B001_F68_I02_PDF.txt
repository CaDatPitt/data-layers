Dear M
Thank you for your letter of January 24, 1973. responding to the item concerning the composition of the on Interim Care.
I am
Task Force
The State-wide Task Force on Interim Care will include consumers and/or parents of retarded persons, service providers, base service unit and county program office personnel, and regional mental retardation staff. A Sub-committee on Mental Retardation, part of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Advisory Committee, is presently organizing the Task Force which has as its ultimate objective the restructuring of the interim care program to secure the highest possible quality of residential care provided by the private sector for the mentally retarded.
The Task Force will make the final review of the regional team findings and recommend action priorities for those private licensed facilities in need of improvement. One of the primary functions of the Interim Care Task Force is to make policy recommendations for the future of interim care within the framework of the residential services delivery system. Secondarily, the Task Force will offer suggestions to improve the private licensed facility review process recently completed throughout the State.
The Department continues to demonstrate its commitment
to improve the care and treatment of mentally disabled citizens in the Commonwealth. I appreciate your continuing support and assistance in our efforts leading to resolution of what has long been recognized as a problem situation. We welcome the participation and involvement of all those concerned with upgrading existing situations and ensuring that those situations do not occur for future citizens.
Sincerely,
(Mrs.) Helene Wohlgemuth
