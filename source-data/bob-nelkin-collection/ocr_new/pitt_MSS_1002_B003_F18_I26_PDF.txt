FROM: Sally Hollyfield, Residential Care Committee
RE: Recommendations to Close Admissions at Western State School and Hospital
Because the overcrowding and understaffing at Western State School and Hospital results in daily injury or death and inadequate care of the residents, the Allegheny County Chapter, Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens demands the closing of all admissions and immediate reduction of overcrowding.
Admissions should remain closed until the ’’total care” lodges comply with the minimum standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH) and Federal Medical Assistance (MA). This means the lodges must meet Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals staff/ resident ratio and maximum population requirements.
The Allegheny County Chapter, Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens insists that immediate alternatives be created by the Department of Public Welfare and Mental Health/Mental Retardation for mentally retarded citizens who are also severely physically or emotionally handicapped, or whose family needs respite care.
The Allegheny County Chapter, Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens will assist with the Development of Residential Alternatives and will obtain legal counsel to aid the Department of Public Welfare to fight MH/MR or Juvenile court ordered commitments.
