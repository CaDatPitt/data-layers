Hon. Helene Wohlgemuth, Secretary Department of Public Welfare 333 Health and Welfare Building Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
I am writing to you regarding your courageous actions in dealing with the most primitive conditions at Polk State School and Hospital.
I have been employed as a coordinator in The Right to Education Office for one year. As part of my professional duties, I work with the intermediate units in which Selinsgrove, Laurelton, White Haven and Polk are located. On many occasions, I have visited all of these facilities. During these visits I was very impressed with what I saw, with the exception of Polk. It bewildered me to see such lackadaisical and crude treatment of patients. I could not understand why the other facilities I visited are able to do so much more with the same types of residents. Certainly there must be more to it than the newness of the physical plant or the ability level of the residents.
The change of attitudes and actions will certainly be necessary if Polk is to achieve the same high standards of the other facilities which I have visited. Through your brave actions, this change has begun. May I applaud you for your willingness to cause a turnabout in what so often seems to be a never-ending, self-perpetuating situation. You were courageous enough to take a stand and to fight to improve a most inhumane treatment of those who cannot fight for themselves.

Very truly yours,
Louis G. Mete
P.S. I am writing this not in my official capacity but as a private citizen.
