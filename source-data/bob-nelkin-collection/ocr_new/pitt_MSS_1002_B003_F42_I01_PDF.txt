It is our position that Immediate Action be taken to house

the lives
of their fellow residents, those employees responsible
care, and to protect the. residents themselves from self

being implemented to prepare residents
But are these residents ready for this
In most instances they are definitely
not!! The very residents who are inflicting injury upon fellow
residents and employees have been, or are being.considered for
placement in the community!1
Our residents and employees are quite frequently being assaulted,
beaten and threatened by these more aggressive residents. These
same residents have been allowed free reign throughout the institution,
the office of
the
they please on grounds. (^They habitually frequent Acting Superintendent with the purpose of ’'tattling”
on employees,
and
knowingly place these employees under' suspicion by
their tales
The
residents are encouraged to report to the Acting
‘Superintendent and their falsehoods are supported by the administration ' /* ’
