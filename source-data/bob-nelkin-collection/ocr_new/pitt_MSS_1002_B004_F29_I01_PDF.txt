re:	Michael V
Dear Mr. Appel:
At the January 7, 1976 hearing regarding Michael	you
reported to the Court that no placements have become avaHBble for him though numerous applications have been sent out to various group homes and institutions. Michael has been in shelter, according to our records, for approximately six months. It was my understanding at the hearing that one of the difficulties in placing Michael was that testing* has indicated he has a low I.Q. Consequently, I contacted Mr. Robert Nelkin, Associate Executive Director for the Allegheny County Chapter of P.A.R.C. He informed me, after I explained Michael’s situation, that Michael might be a good candidate for a foster home. Referrals could be made to Child Welfare Services foster home program or possibly to Family and Children's foster home program.
In view of the length of time that Michael has been in McIntyre Shelter and the unlikely probability that he will be- accepted by a private agency, I think that the possibility of a foster home placement should be explored thoroughly. If I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to give me a call.
Very truly yours,
ERIC N. ANDERSON
Attorney at Law
