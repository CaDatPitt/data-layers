Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth::
I, as a parent of a retarded, son (living at home), am greatly disturbed by what appears to be a high-handed handling of the Polk situation.
My husband and I have had quite a bit of contact with Dr. McClelland and Polk in the past years.. We both feel that he is an unusually able administrator who has handled an impossible situation of overcrowding and lack of funding fantastically well.
When you and I can supply the means to employ attendants on a on-to-one basis, we will be able to dispose of all restraints.
My own feeling is that this is too costly and not even necessary.. No one gets hysterical when we confine our young children to play pens so that we can keep them out of harm and go about our business. The responsible person has to have an alternative before an old method of handling a situation is removed. Those very patients whom you seek to help might not even be able to tolerate the freedom of movement suddenly thrust upon them.
My husband and I have toured Polk, including some of the so-called back wards, and give our whole-hearted support to Dr. McClelland. We feel his accomplishments are commendable and that he’s being the sdape goat for society,!s neglect.
Sinderely yours
