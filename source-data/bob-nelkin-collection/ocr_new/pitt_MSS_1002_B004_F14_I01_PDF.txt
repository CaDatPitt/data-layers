James H. McClelland, M.D.
Polk State School and Hospital
Polk, Pennsylvania 16342
Dear Doctor McClelland:
I regret to inform you that you are hereby removed from your position as Superintendent, facility for the mentally disabled, Polk State School and Hospital,- effective at the close of business, May 1, 1973.
Effective immediately, Dr. Wesley D. White, Superintendent of White Haven State School and Hospital, will assume, in an acting capacity, complete administrative responsibility for the operation of Polk State School and Hospital.
The reasons for your removal are:
1.	The cruel, degrading, and inhumane conditions which I personally observed during my visit on April 14, 1973. This refers specifically to the locked "cages" and pens in which you authorized the confinement of patients.
2.	Severe and chronic deficiencies with respect to the proper training and orientation of professional and non-professional staff in the appropriate care and treatment of mentally retarded residents.
It is expected that every effort will be made to ensure an orderly period of transition for the welfare of residents and staff.
This action is being taken under Section 807 of the Civil Service Act. If you should desire to appeal, your letter to the Civil Service Commission requesting an appeal should set forth reasons to support the appeal. A copy of this letter should be supplied to this office. Such reasons will, of course, have to be substantiated by evidence and testimony upon hearing.
James H. McClelland, M.D.	- 2 -	April 16, 1973
