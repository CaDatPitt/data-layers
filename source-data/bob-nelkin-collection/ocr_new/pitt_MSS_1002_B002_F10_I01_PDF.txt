Dear Carla:
I have just had an opportunity to read your October 1st Report to the Court on the Individuals Who Moved from Pennhurst. The anecdotal reports of individual client progress are certainly positive and should serve as a continued incentive to all persons working to develop community resources. The demographics were interesting and should be helpful in future planning efforts. I was most particularly encouraged by the data showing an increase in family participation following placement of a client into the community.
I would recommend that for the future, reports such as this be issued on a regular basis. It may be useful to incorporate data from monitoring efforts such as the upcoming community placement audit.
I would appreciate it if you would share this letter with your staff.
Sincerely, .*
