Mr. Joseph Colombatto, Superintendent
Polk State School and Hospital Box #94
Polk, Pa. 16342
Dear Joe,
I would appreciate answers to the following questions regarding admissions to Polk:
1)	How many admissions to Polk in the last 12 months?
2)	How many of those admissions to Polk were by court order?
3)	What is the criteria for admission to Polk?
4)	Are you satisfied with community programs developing alternatives around for individuals who have requested admissions?
We had great success in stopping all admissions to Western State School and Hospital. I hope it is similar success (without our involvement) at Polk.
Sincerely,
Robert Nelkin
Associate Executive Director
