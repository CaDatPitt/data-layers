Mr. Joseph Diannabell
White Deer Interim Care Facility Main and Hudson Streets
Hawley, Pennsylvania 18428
Dear Mr. Diannabell:
Our Board of Directors has designated me, and a team of expert consultants, to visit all interim care facilities housing Allegheny County residents. We have been advised that a number of such individuals reside in your facility.
We anticipate being in the Hawley area during the week of August 6th. We would very much like to visit you and tour your facility at that time. If it is acceptable, we will check in with you upon arrival.
We look forward to meeting you.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Virginia J. Thornburgh, Chairman State Sahool and Hospital and Interim
Care Committee
