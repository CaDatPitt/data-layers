ool applauds the efforts of the tai Retardation Program to prov orderly planning of community p who are residents of State Ser/
Western State S( Mental Heal th/M-within which the retarded citizer place. Vie wish
the implementation of this plan, staff, who you request, will be ■Service staff. Hr. Aquino will Crompton.
In the interest of facilitating Allegheny County Plan, we offer
1.
Monitoring of All Allegheny
County Residents:
Western State has, and will continue to welcome the monitoring efforts of Base Service Units. We sincerely hope that al_l_ Allegheny County BSU's will feel the urgency of this mandate. We also must hope that in determining residents who are most appropriate for return to the conwiunity Western State staff are consulted. Who is considered “most appropriate" is subject to considerable variance in interpretation, we have found.
2.
Pre-Discharge Planning:
We support the proposed pre-discharge planning effort. This plan, however, pre-supposes that a steady flow of community placements will be available on a consistant basis ov ./ tire If this goal can be achieved, it will, without a doubt, facilitate the orderly and planful placement of residents. Should a steady flow of placement, availability fail to be achieved we fear that the requirement that the Service Plans be completed three months prior to placement may become one of those well-intentioned, but ill conceived, requirements that end in becoming a barrier rather than a facilitator u» services.
r.
3. Finally, as the Superintendent of a facility for the retarded . citizen, I -am forced to remind you of certain legal obligations which may take precedence over orderly planning. For example, a resident who was committed when he was under 18 under section 402 or 403 of the MH/MR Act has the right to choose whether he will remain in the institution or leave upon becoming 18 (see Western Regional Office memo of June, 1974). Or,' in the case of a resident committed under section 406 of the KH/MR Ac€, the resident must be released upon reaching optimum benefit from the institution regardless of whether the placement process is ready for him or not.
If we have appeared to be impatient with proposals for an obviously desirable discharge planning process, it is because, knowing as we do the tragedy of inappropriate institutionalization, we feel an obligation to continue to press for bettor and speedier availability of community placements. I find myself, considering the conditions in Western Pennsylvania institutions, wondering whether even the prospect of ex-residents, "....wandering off into oblivion" is not to be preferred to continued inappropriate institutionalization.
