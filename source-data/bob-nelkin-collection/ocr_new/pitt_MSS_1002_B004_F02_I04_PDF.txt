
POLICY
ABUSIVE TREATMENT OF RESIDENTS
I am sure that the policy at Polk State School since its beginning has been that no resident be physically or psychologically abused in any way. I would like to restate this policy at this time to clarify the responsibilities that all Staff at Polk State School has in regard to this matter.
Physical or psychological abuse has no place in the program5 treatment or care of the mentally retarded. Therefore3 corporal punishment is not permitted.
Psychological abuse constitutes actions such as verbally degrading residents3 using residents as the butt of jokes3 creating untenable situations which a resident has no recourse but to over-react^ etc.
Our responsibility is to constantly strive towards the development of a psychologically positive environment plus relating to all residents in a positive responsive way. All Staff not only has the responsibility of following this policy in their own actions3 but also has the responsibility to stop others’ actions which are abusive to residents^ or reporting same to your immediate supervisor.
Our employment at Polk State School is only justified relative to the programs and services that we provide to the mentally retarded and their families. I expect that all Staff will adhere to the above stated policy without exception.
