ALLEGHENY COUNTY URGENTLY NEEDS ALTERNATIVES TO INSTITUTIONS
Mary Wilson, the parent of an 18-year old son who requires 24-hour a day supervision, asked the Allegheny County Chapter to organize a meeting to answer for her and other parents who keep their retarded son or daughter at home one overwhelming question: what will happen to my dependent child when I die?
The meeting was held on June 26th, attended by nearly 300 parents and the Secretary of the Public Welfare Department, Frank Beal. For two hours the parents demonstrated the need for more alternatives to state institutions by revealing to Secretary Beal their family's needs.
Many of the situations that parents described were "urgent", "critical", "immediate", and "desperate". Other parents were worried about what would happen to their son/daughter when they (the parents) die.
The parents generally were frustrated and/or angered at the state DPW for failing to develop alternatives to institutions at a reasonable rate. Robert Matesic, ACC-PARC President, told Mr. Beal:
"We plead with the government of the State of Pennsylvania through the Department of Public Welfare to provide our children with a decent place to live and learn to avert their possible warehousing in an institution when we die. We don't want just a bed and a roof for our sons and daughters. We want a clean, sanitary, safe, comfortable living arrangement with the type of constant supervision and advice we've given our children all their lives."
ACC-PARC distributed a paper entitled "Pretty Words? Or a Real Commitment? State Officials Talk About Alternatives to Institutions". Interspersed between the Governor's and Welfare Secretary's proclamations favoring community living were these facts:
(1)	the state funded only one new group home for the county in the last year;
(2)	the state is funding no new group homes for the county in the next year;
(continued)
(continued)
(3)	during the last year the state funded no new foster homes in Allegheny County;
(4)	according to the state’s plan, the county has received $1 million less for community living than was promised. This means 100 less people are being served than planned;
(5)	there is a shortage of adult training programs in the county. Nearly 200 individuals are sitting at home awaiting the start of new sheltered workshops or adult activity centers;
(6)	there is no place for people to go who need residential care. Admissions to Western State School and Hospital are closed. Private institutions are filled and no alternatives are being built.
Parents, not wanting to hear any more "pretty words" from the state, had invited Secretary Beal to listen only, not to speak. The co-chairpersons of the meeting, Marlene Burda and Mary Wilson, suggested to Mr. Beal that he respond through actions rather than words. They suggested anong other ways that he might ask for a supplemental appropriation from the legislature for community services, make the five-year plan more ambitious, and cut some of the red tape.
At the end of the meeting Secretary Beal thanked the parents for sharing their needs with him. He stated^. "I will stand on my words and those of my predecessors." The Secretary plans to meet again in September with the Allegheny County parents to tell them of the actions he has taken.
During the summer parents plan to meet within their own communities, to "organize their thoughts and their needs". Parents who are interested in volunteering to participate in these meetings are asked to call the Chapter office, 322-6008, or mail the return form contained in this issue of the Accents.
Several legislators also attended the meeting, and expressed their appreciation for the manner in which the parents publicly voiced their concerns: "anger and frustration, yes, but not arm-waving hostility". (NOTE: legislators attending were Senators Early and Romanelli, Representatives Abraham, Caputo, Raven-stahl. Rep. Fisher sent a representative.)
After the meeting, Mary Wilson knew one thing for sure .. most parents share her concern for her son's future. As one parent said, "My heart goes out to all of us."
Yes, I would like to participate in meetings to discuss needed alterna tives to institutions.

SON DISMISSED FROM INSTITUTION BECAUSE OF PARENT
A young man was dismissed from a state-licensed and funded residential facility because his parent persistently questioned the care and training the son received from the institution. The dismissal of the young man to his parent's home followed subtle threats and intimidation from the facility's administrators that, "If you don't like the program, take your son out".
Getting rid of children of parents who are "trouble-makers" may be one of the crudest actions that can be taken by an institution. Yet none of us stopped this cruelty. Not the other parents, the local MH/MR Center, the County MH/MR office, the Department of Public Welfare, or this Association.
Until we do stop intimidation and the getting rid of children of questioning parents, the question will remain, "Who is next to go?"
INSTITUTIONS; MANY CHANGES AND NO CHANGE
Admissions to Western State School and Hospital are closed. Polk has decreased from 2,750 to 1,950 residents in just two years.
The Superintendents of Polk and Western were fired. Numerous evaluations and consultant reports have been filed. Both facilities are trying to develop good training programs.
In other words, many changes for the better have occurred.
HOWEVER .. we recently visited Polk and Western for one day each and found no change in one of the most important areas; tender-loving-care. In two whole days of visits, we saw only a few of hundreds of the staff we observed giving personal attention to the residents.
Why couldn't the staff have talked to the boys and girls when they were feeding them? Couldn't someone have pushed a boy on the swing instead of watching him like prison guards do? Where were the reassuring words and physical touching? Couldn't the staff have tried to stimulate activity and help the residents grow and learn?
We think all of this should be happening since the working conditions are improving. We praise those workers who care about the residents and give them attention and tender-loving-care. We challenge the workers who don't. A lot more needs to be done I
PARENTS IN OTHER STATES RECEIVE SUBSIDY PAYMENTS
New York and Minnesota are beginning subsidies to families to assist them in maintaining their retarded child at home.
The experimental program in Minnesota grants monthly subsidies of up to $250.00 per child. The child must be (1) under 18 years of age and (2) eligible for placement in an institution. The program in New York is similar to the Minnesota program. It was ordered by a Federal Court Judge to help improve conditions at Willowbrook State Institution.
A radical idea? Well, why not? Family care is less expensive to the taxpayer than institutional care would be. And the children receive the love and attention missing in most institutions. Anyone want to start the ball rolling in Pennsylvania?
EAST AREA PARENTS ORGANIZE .. MORE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR ADULTS
Eighty parents in the eastern suburbs organized in May and June to get another sheltered workshop started. They are doing this because their adult sons/daughters are sitting (or will be sitting after graduation) at home without anything to do.
The parents met with the Allegheny County Mental Retardation Administrator, Chuck Peters, to request that a sheltered workshop be started in the Penn Hills area. Peters praised the parents "for looking ahead better than the professionals do." But Peters was unable to make a firm commitment to the parents because of uncertainty about funds from the state.
The parents then met with Senator Majority Leader Tom Nolan and State Representa tive Ron Cowell. Both legislators promised to meet with the County Commissioners to help get the sheltered workshop started.
PARENTS TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT OF OVERCHARGE BY INSTITUTION
In January we discovered that the State of Pennsylvania was discarding legislation which PARC sponsored. Senate Bill #53, when passed by the legislature and signed into law by the Governor, meant parents would no longer be required to pay for their son's/daughter’s MH/MR services once they reached 18 years of age. But, the Department of Public Welfare ignored the law and charged some parents for their son's or daughter's room and board in an institution.
Through the help of our state association and Attorney Dane Ferleger from Philadelphia, the Justice Department informed the Department of Public Welfare that they (DPW) were breaking the law. DPW has finally agreed to pay back the parents who were illegally charged.
A parent from a local institution brought DPW's illegal action to our attention. We all are grateful to him.
PARENTS' R.I.P. CORPORATION DEVELOPED
Over the last months, some parents met to organize a non-profit corporation to act in their place, as surrogate parents, when they die. One of the parents said, "What I want from this corporation is to be able to Rest in Peace". Thus, the name
The need for this corporation (R.I.P. Corp.) was stated by parents in various ways. (1) Other parents can best care for their son/daughter due to empathy; (2) the future of their sons and daughters should not be left to government due to lack of sensitivity; (3) siblings should not be burdened with the responsibility of the dependent person's care; (4) bank trust officers will gladly be relieved of tough decisions about the dependent person (banks will still make investment decisions) .
Some ideas for how R.I.P. Corp, will work are: (1) corporation will advise bank on the use of funds and the care of the person; (2) corporation will be the individual's advocate; (3) corporation's money will supplement care provided by government agencies; (4) family's home will be willed to the corporation to be the residence of the son/daughter and others.
Many other ideas are being considered. We'll keep you informed of R.I.P. Corp.' development.

GOVERNOR CALLS CONFERENCE ON THE HANDICAPPED TO BE HELD IN DECEMBER 1976 AT HERSHEY, PA.
In preparation for this Conference, Region V (which includes Allegheny County) will hold a pre-planning conference on August 15. Five major areas of concern are to be discussed and priorities decided upon. It is important for all of us to make our needs known. Our voices will be a part of the voices raised by all other major areas of the handicapped such as multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, blind, etc. Be sure that your needs, the interests of the retarded, are included.
Our Region will have 75 delegates to the Hershey Conference representing all of the disabilities. Of the 75 delegates, 50% must be represented by handicapped individuals themselves; 25%, parents, siblings, or guardians of handicapped individuals; and 25%, other providers and advocates. It would be important to include in your reply, on a separate letter, your protest that since the mentally retarded will be unable to act as their own spokesmen at this conference, consideration should be given for increased representation by Barents or other advocates for the retarded.

ABATEMENT OF LIABILITY	In the bulletin from Secretary of Public Welfare Frank Beal, the following information was distributed throughout Pennsylvania on March 26, 1976 : "I am ordering the abatement of liability for an initial Psychological Evaluation (e.g., tests, batteries, etc.) performed by Base Service Units whenever the source of such recommendation involved a 'Due Process Hearing' case. The responsible public school district/Intermediate Unit will verify such requests. These will only be honored when performed in the established procedure by Base Service Unit personnel or contracted personnel."
