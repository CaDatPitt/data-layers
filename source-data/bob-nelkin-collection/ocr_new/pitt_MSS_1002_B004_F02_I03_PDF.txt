AIHISSION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
1.	All referrals to Polk State School are to be made through the MH/MR Base Service Unit.
2.	Each referral must be accompanied by as much recent medical, psychological, social, educational and behavioral data as possible.

This request for goal specific services will then be jointly planned with Polk State School staff to determine a timetable and program to meet these goals. This timetable will also state what action or direction will be taken when the goals are accomplished (such as return home,
• placement in a foster home, group home, etc.).
