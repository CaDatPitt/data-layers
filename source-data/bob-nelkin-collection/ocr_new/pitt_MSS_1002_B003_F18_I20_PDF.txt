Dear Mrs. Thornburgh:
Thank you for your letter of September 30, asking to appear as a witness in a case involving Joyce Z| |
I shall be more than happy to have you testify as a "friend of the court".
I would suggest that you contact R. Stanton Wettick, Esq., Executive Director of Neighborhood Legal Services, to determine whether or not a Neighborhood Legal Services attorney has been appointed to represent Joyce. If not, it may be that MHMR has appointed an attorney for her. In any event I imagine it would be a good idea for you to communicate with the attorney who is going to represent Joyce.
Best wishes.
Sincerely,
Maurice B. Cohill, Jr.
Judge
