Re; Polk State School
Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
It is my opinion that you have been used by several politicians for their own purposes. Please allow me to explain: I attended a meeting at Edinboro State College where you were the featured speaker. After listening to your emotional address concerning the welfare of children in the Commonwealth, I was impressed by your apparent dedication to your responsibilities. Remembering this address, I can readily understand how your first reaction to the ’’cages” at Polk State School would lead you to request the resignation of Doctor Me Clelland. It is my opinion that these ’’cages” are much superior to drugging children. Drugs will be the outcome of your action due to the lack of staff ( I’m sure Dr. Me Clelland has asked for additional staff in the past -perhaps if more attention were paid to those closest to situations).
As I read in the papers, Dr. Me Clelland refused to turn Polk State School into a political patronage plum as was requested by several local politicians. Residents of this area have always been proud that Polk State School has been kept above politics. Now it appears that you have been used to dismiss one administrator and replace him with one more sympathetic to the politicians requests for patronage appointments.
I urge you to reconsider your actions in regard to the Polk State situation - your impetuosity in your actions has added greatly to the ill-will created. You have lost the admiration and respect of many people who formerly thought you to be fair and a good administrator.
