Your Honor:
Concerning Polk State Hospital:-
First, I am a fullfledged votingAmerican,citizen, aged 83 years, and still very active.
All my life I have worked with all types of people, in Community Welfare and Red Cross family service-all volunteer.
I was cited by the American Cross for fifty (50) years of Voluntary Service.
I have known families where some member of their family is a type that could be in an institution such as Polk State Hospital, but are kept at home with tender, loving care.
One I know was 55 years old-a long time-but with wonderful consideration.
I know some people who have a member of their family in Polk State Hospital-the only reason because they couldn’t get proper care in their home;and 1 have never heard one word against the care or treatment they are getting, and they had nothing but praise for Dr.James McClelland, and his staff.
The cages Mrs. Wohlgemuth ’’blew up” about, and told the world, were not for punishment, but for their own protection and the protection of others-time has proved that.
I understand that most persons who hold office, like to make "big deals”to show the "home folks” their authority and accomplish-ment-not always to their credit.
I never criticise without suggestion,
First, I would suggest that Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth-Pa. Sec. of Welfare at the price the attendants are paid-spend one month each 24 hours each day)with a group of 10 or more patients, Young children, adult females, also males to run consectively:
Second, that a person'who hasinot become humane in that time should be removed from office and replaced.
Third, that any person or persons not satisfi-ed with the care and treatment of their person in Folk State Hospital, take them away from there.
1 am sure they would be glad to release then to their families. That would give another person a chance to be admitted, for I am sure uou have a waiting list there.
I urge you to act immediately to reinstate Dr. James McClelland, who has given 15 years of his life in that sort of work.
I am sure you would not serve as he has honourably-even if you could qualify.
The enclosed clipping was taken from the Erie "Times",Erie, Pa., Sunday, Apri]. Apa±il 1975, and written by Columnist Ed. Mathews.
My plea is this-reinstate Dr. James McClelland, and, 1 think an apology is in order.
Yours very truly,
(Miss) MarionfTay1or.
