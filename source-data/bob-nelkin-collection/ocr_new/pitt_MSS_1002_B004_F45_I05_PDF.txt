COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE HARRISBURG
HELENE WOHLGEMUTH SECRETARY
May 7, 1973
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Rosenblatt:
During recent weeks the families of the residents at Polk State School and Hospital have been worried by a variety of rumors. We know this is natural during a change in leadership, but it is unfortunate because it creates unnecessary anxiety and alarm for you.
Therefore, I hasten to assure you that our uppermost concern is for the improved care and treatment for all Polk residents.
We have a responsibility to develop a program that will allow each Polk resident to achieve his greatest potential. We know that is what you, also, want.
You have my personal assurances that we intend to meet that responsibility.
Sincerely,
