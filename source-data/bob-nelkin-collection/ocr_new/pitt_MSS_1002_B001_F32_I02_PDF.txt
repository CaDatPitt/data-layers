FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Pennsylvania's Secretary of Public Welfare, Frank Beal, will address a public meeting sponsored by the Allegheny County Chapter of the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens (ACC-PARC) on Saturday, November 20. The meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m. at the Bell Telephone Building Auditorium in downtown Pittsburgh. Secretary Beal has been asked to outline the Commonwealth's five-year plan for the development of community-based residential facilities and programs as alternatives to the institutionalization of children and adults who are mentally retarded.
This is the third in a series of meetings sponsored by ACC-PARC concerned with the State's plans for community alternatives to institutionalization. Ms. Mary Wilson, ACC's parent member who was instrumental in initiating the meetings, questions why funds projected for residences needed in Allegheny County next year are zero, although "the Commonwealth is committed philosophically to the establishment of such facilities."
