U.	Q.	Have	due	process	notices gone out to all parents?
A.	No.	Due	Process	Notices are in process.
5.	Q.	Have	the	parents	been properly informed regarding	program descrip-
tions, individual implications for their child, hours in programming, the teacher, the location of the educational setting, etc.?
A. Whether or not they have been properly informed remains a question. However, we have through a letter from Mr. Colombatto informed each parent of the children involved in the educational program of I.U. #6. The NEWS-LETTER has also carried an article in regard to tlie education program. Hie parents have all been given school calendars and have also been invited to attend an Open-House on October 2$ and 26 as part of American Education Week. We have also furnished detailed educational reports to any parent who ha3 made a request.
6.	Q. Have the parents been informed of their rights and have alterna-
tives been presented?
A. It is questionable as to whether they have been informed of their rights and alternatives. However, this should be covered through the Due Process letter once it is completed.
7.	Q. How many children are in an educational program for 3 to $ hours
per day? For 1 to 3 hours? For Hess than 1 hour?
A. We have 366 who are receiving 3-f> hours, and we have 76 who are receiving 1-3 hours. None are receiving less than one hour.
8.	Q, Do you feel that parents are able to make an informed judgment as
to the appropriateness of the educational placement of their child?
A. As to parents making informed judgment as to the appropriateness of the placement of their children, this ability would vary with every parent. Some parents would be able to assess the program their child is in and make an intelligent decision as to its appropriateness. For others, it would depend upon their knowledge of educational procedures.
9.	Q. What type of in-service training program has been provided for your
staff?
Mr. G. Richard Sell
