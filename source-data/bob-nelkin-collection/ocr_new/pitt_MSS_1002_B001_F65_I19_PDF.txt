Dear Sir:
I have read with great interest newspaper accounts of your investigation of Laural House in Fayette County and Allegheny Valley School in Pittsburgh. I note that both have in common the fact that they are private, non-profit facilities. May I take the liberty of suggesting another worthwhile area of investigation?
You should specifically investigate and audit private, profitmaking interim care facilities subsidized by the Department of Welfare. Interim care facilities are facilities, such as Allegheny Valley School, that house mentally retarded individuals who are waiting assignment to state schools and hospitals.

By way of comparison, day programs conducted by this organization cost $8.00 per diem. It would appear to be impossible for the entrepreneurs that a program for less a day for food and

Clearly, the only way a profit can be made is by reducing financial commitment to plant or program areas. If you would like additional information, do not hesitate to contact me.
Best personal wishes.
