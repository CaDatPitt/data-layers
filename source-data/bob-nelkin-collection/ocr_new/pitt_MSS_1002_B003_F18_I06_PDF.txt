Mr. Robert Hiltner, superintendent eastern state School and Hos ital 333 Curry Hill Road
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317
Dear Mr. Hiltner:
We have been advised by Hob Nelkin of the Allegheny County Association for Retarded Citizens that he was denied access to records of two residents who died, one by aspiration and the other from internal bleeding.
since ACC-HARC is a reputable advocacy group for the retarded and Bob Nelkin certainly has proved hia reliability and genuine concern (as opposed to meddling) in the retarded, we are v;ondering whether this is a state ruling or a local ruling that has seemed to oppose any investigation into these two deaths? 7e were also told that Dr. bradley cannot find time until January 21 to answer questions regarding these deaths.
Will you please let us know what tho procedure should be regarding the investigation of deaths at Western State? We do not feel, as in the case of Roy <cods, that the Coroner must be called in every death and indeed we are sure he would not come. On the other hand, denying access to records and delaying answering questions makes parents wonder if there is anything to hide.
Can we therefore got together on some mutually satisfactory method of allowing the Parents Group and/or ACC-PARC to satisfy themsiives that no resident is being denied his "right to live."
Sincerely yours,
