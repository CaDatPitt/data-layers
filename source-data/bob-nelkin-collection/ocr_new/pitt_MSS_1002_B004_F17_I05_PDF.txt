Report of Telephone call.
TO:
Secretary Wohlgemuth
FROM:
Marguerite
Yolanda
called from Detroit, Michigan. Wanted to inform you
and to go on record as opposed to the dismissal of Dr. McClelland. Feels he was unjustly accused. She has a brother who has been at Polk for 39 years. She has seen the place grow and feels that the people up there have been well taken care of. Feels Dr. McClelland should be reinstated, as he has done an excellent job in taking care of those children.
