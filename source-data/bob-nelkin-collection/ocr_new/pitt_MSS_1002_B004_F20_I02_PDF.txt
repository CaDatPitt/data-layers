Dear Sir:
As a retired employee of Polk State School and Hospital, I support Dr. Jas. Jas. H . McClelland Jr. in his administration at Polk. He is a man whose life has been devoted to Polk and a person who undoubtedly knows as much about mental retardation as any living person. He is not an exponent of barbaric and cruel treatment, but a well qualified head of a mental institution and must bo reinstated as superintendent. No two hour or two visit exposure to Polk can qualify any person to be a judge of practices or persons.
Mrs. Ylkin or any others with such pre-conceived ideas SIiCT-LD WORN AS AN EMPLOYES in one of the divisions where these retarded people live, for a period ofJUST OtiS MONTH. She could even volunteer her services.
I’ll wager she will be pulled, punched, bit, sworn at, spat upon—you name it and she will find it-.
These are not normal, educsblo, cooperative persons she SHOULD work with. They arc people who at times have to bo isolated, restrained or sedated, for their own good, as well as that of other patients who have to live in the surroundings.
Mrs. Wohlgemuth must have a very perceptive eye and mind, that in one TWO HOUR visit sho can pass judgment on a dedicated doctor and superintendent with thirty-two years of experience. She apparently knows nothing about caring for these unfortunate people and must be relieved of her job. Anyone so ignorant of conditions in a mental hospital that she does not understand why restraints of many kinds, of necessity mu3t be used,, certainly should not use her power to fire someone who is qualified. What background in this fi Id doos sho have and how is she so qualified? These beggage carts as sho so rudely called them, are the one and only means of getting some patients out of bed and mixed with the population. They are carts but carts of mercy and until sho has something much better to offer, she should be thankful Polk has them.
Take away the play-ens, the carts ahd the restraints and sedatives as she demands and many will be maimed and perhaps even killed. These patSents are not responsible for their actions, and do not have the mentality to know wiat they do. Mrs. Wohlgemuth made public statements that disgrace not only Dr. McClelland but every other person who now works or who has ever worked at Polk. H er statements are not true and she does not know whereof she speaks. She Qwes Dr. .McClelland a public apology, and boforo she makes any more insane remarks she had better spend more than two hours at Polk. Anyone who publically makes statements as she has, about things and people.of which she had no actual knowledge, is in no way fit to be Secretary of any
Dopa rtment •
I worked, as an attendant, at Polk for twelve years and know what goes on. The people who really know what Polk is all about, the behavior, attitudes,care and problems of these patients are the ones who really work "with them. Certainly not some one behind a desk in a city miles away.
All these patients are exceptionally well fed, clean, well clothed and provided for. Their care is far superior to what many of them vxould have at home.
Trusting that you will take immediate action to relieve Mrs. Wohlgemuth of hor duties and reinstate Dr. McClelland as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital,.
I ara
Very truly
(Mrs. S. 3has.)
