I am writing in regards to the firing of Doctor I cClelland at roll: State.
I feel that this was too severe and perhaps too hasty. It could be that the information we receive thru the news media is rather limited.
I think perha ,s the thing about this incident that upset me most was the suggestion, credited to you, in the paper, that drugs should be used to control these people. I am very much opposed to anyone su gesting publically that drugs offer a way of life for even these unfortunate creatures. If I had a child like this, I would rather that it be as aware as it physically could be to this world, yes, even from a "cage”, than to live in a world all alone made of drugs. Jy children, thank God, are all normal heal thy teenagers and everyday there are bombarded with information that is supposed to convince them that drugs are not the answer to anything of value. I feel this remark was ill-advised end untimely. Since the opinions of the public are usually not considered, solutions to the problem need not be discussed with the news apers
fell me, ; rs. ’Johlpemuth, has anyone ever suggested that we start to drug
convicts to control them? Aren’t they like tiese )eople in that they may
not be left to their ovm devices because they are not responsible?
I wish you peace and hope that all of y?ur decisions will not result in such uproar.
