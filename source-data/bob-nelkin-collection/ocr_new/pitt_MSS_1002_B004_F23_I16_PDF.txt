From The Patriot Wire Services
Welfare Secretary Helen Wohlegemuth yesterday issued a directive prohibiting cages for people in state institutions.
The directive came soon after Welfare Department officials acknowledged that they • knew such cages were in use at Polk State School and Hospital for retarded persons six months before the superintendent was fired last week.
“The use of locked cages or pens for the incarceration of residents is expressly prohibited,” Mrs. Wohlgemuth said. She said her office was to be . informed immediately of any Violations.
I Meanwhile, Edward Goldman, director of the department’s office of mental retardation, said he learned of the caging at Polk last November. But a halt was not ordered until Dr. James McClelland, superintendent, was fired.
Goldman said he spent the past six months gathering evidence that would give the department grounds for dismissing McClelland.
The results of that investigation are being kept confidential because McClelland has asked the Civil Service Commission for a hearing to appeal the dismissal.
Goldman said because of the complexities of the civil service system and the politics of
the state hospital system he thought the department should have a solid case against McClelland before moving for dismissal. .
Many people have been aw--are that the superintendent was at Polk for quite some time and he had a lot of support,” Goldman said. ‘‘It was my feeling we had to have documentation so the dismissal would stick.”
Welfare Secretary Helene Wohlgemuth, who released news of the caging after visiting the hospital last week, said simply ordering the institution to stop using the cages would have been futile.
She said the hospital’s staff was concerned more with restricting patients than, rehabilitating them and would have turned to other methods, such as straight jackets and drugs.
Dynamite Scare
Proves Groundless
The installation of sewer lines in Hampden Twp. almost became an “explosive” issue yesterday, when a Camp Hill contractor found wires six feet below ground leading to what he believed to be sticks of dynamite.
Contractors for Arthur R. Nagle Construction Co., installing sewer lines in property owned by a Hampden Twp. resident, found the wires while digging a trench, and immediately called a demolition team from the Letterkenny Army Unit.
The unit was joined by S. W. Arnolds of the Division of Mines, Quarries and Ex-
plosives of the state Department of Environmental Resources, who initally determined that the wires were still active.
According to officials of the construction company, experts twice tried to detonate what they thought was dynamite left there a year ago by a company that installed the sewer’s main trunk line, but were unsucces-ful in their attempts.
After digging deeper into the trench, experts discovered that the dynamite had already been exploded but that the wires had crossed, causing the incorrect “active” reading on the explosives gauge.
