Dear Norm:
from Mike Levine and Mr. H. W.
arory
to Dr. James McClel After reading Mr.
I am sure you will agree it is very reasonable and balanced
I know many parents who would take a much more hostile attitude.
The letters
State School and Hospital, are seIf-expIanaTory. Ietter, frankly,
It does seem to me that if we are serious about normalization, use of the telephone is one of the most normal activities. Possibly your regional task force should address itself to this problem and advise you to a course of action.
I wiI I also refer this to our State School and Hospital and Interim Care Comm i ttee.
Do you anticipate that we could have an opinion by January I?
Best personal wishes,
C. A. Peters
