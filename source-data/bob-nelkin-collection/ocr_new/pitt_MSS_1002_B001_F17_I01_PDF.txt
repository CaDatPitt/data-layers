Dear Mrs. Siciliano:
The article in the March 31 , 197 8 edition of Mov * n On requests that we keep PARC "informed of any new Centers proposed for development". I want you to know that a new Center is being planned in Allegheny County.
It’s hard to come to grips with our feelings toward this new Center. The new Center will make integration less possible. The new Center will limit options of families and students. We know that the new Center is wrong for these reasons.
On the flip side, the parents in the Mon Valley area have long sought better facilities for their sons and daughters. Would PARC or ACC-PARC efforts to halt the development of this new Center be fair to these students and their families?
We feel confused. We hope that a more detached PARC Education Committee can guide us. Should we oppose the construction of a new Center? Should we pursue other methods to increase more integration options?
We are sure that you face similar problems in other Intermediate Units throughout the state (none are as lucky to have the Chairman of the PARC Education Committee as an active parent and citizen). How are the other PARC Chanters resolving this conflict?
