Department of Public Welfare

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
..The Allegheny County Chapter of PARC is delighted that the Secretary has acted upon our suggestions to make all inspections to institutions and interim care facilities unannounced and to place emergency staff in quest'ionable/when a decision regarding the continuance of DPW licensure and the.dispersal/is pending.
On Saturday, November 18, you told The Pittsburgh Press that the review guidance forms_ for judging facilities were drawn up on short notice to facilitate the quick establishment of task forces and that
be
you would "receptive to any recommendations in tightening up the review process." The following recommendations are the result of the combined efforts of staff and volunteers serving on the ACC-PARC Residential Services Committee:
1.	Eliminate the numerical rating system presently being used by the evaluating committee.
2.	Establish separate citizen/consumer inspection teams and state teams, each with equal Department of Public Welfare consideration. Both of these teams would report directly to the Regional Secretary of Public Welfare. This would eliminate the existing regional review committee.
The rationale for this would be:
—Elimination of internal political pressures on departmental investigating teams.
—Increased pressure for accurate and complete on-site inspection
reports.

—TESGb less time	consumed in implementing a change.
--'BSSSt^Bi responsibility would be directly that of the Regional
3 .Secretary.
We would also like to recommend that the State train, test and license proprietors of every residential facility within the Commonwealth because:
—Training will assist the facility owner.
—Testing will assure that the proprietor is knowledgeable.
—Licensure of the proprietor should be a pre-requisite of the licensing of a facility.
We also recommend that profit making facilities be fined their total profit during the period that facility is being brought into total compliance.
