Dr* fartos again repeated her order of the previous night, concerning the Quiet Rooms. Hrs. Gregory again told her that we could not do this.
Dr. Rartos then called me concerning this.
I informed her that according to our Quiet Room procedure an order must he obtained from a doctor before they can be placed in a Quiet Room and a blanket order would not cover this. She stated that this was senseless and she was very upset because the previous night she only had 3\$ hours sleep and she was on call for u8 hours and had 8 hours to work tomorrow. I told her I was sorry that she was disturbed, but vie had our orders from Nursing Office, who in turn
' received their orders from Administration and we had to follow through with their orders. Also that until procedure was changed we had no alternative but to carry it out. Dr. L'artos then stated that if Nursing Office makes the rules and they are never here at night, then they should be called too. She also stated that tomorrow there would be a meeting and she would take care of the matter. If it was not changed she would not be on call anymore.
