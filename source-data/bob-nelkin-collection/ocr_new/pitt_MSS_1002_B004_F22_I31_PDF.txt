Madam:
As an employee of Polk State School and Hospital, I am protesting the dismissal of Dr. James McClelland. I feel the charges brought against him are unjust and totally unfounded. There are inadequacies at Polk, but Dr. McClelland has made a concious effort to make realistic improvements considering the overcrowed conditions which exist. I seriously question your competency as Secretary of D.P.W. when you make decisions sucn as tuls. Your ignorance of Polk is exemplified through your rash decision from a two hour visit and from information gathered from questionable sources. I feel strongly that you must reinstate Dr. McClelland and publicly apologize to him.
Most Sincerely,
Michael L. Ihlenfeld
