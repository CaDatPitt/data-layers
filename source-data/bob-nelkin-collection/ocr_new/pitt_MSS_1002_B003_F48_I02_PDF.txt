
LIAISON MEETING
WESTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL
April 2U, 1975
SUBJECT: Disturbance at WSSH during previous weekend due to actions of one male resident, Eddie.
PRESENT: Two union members, numerous parents, Dr. Scott and one administrative assistant, and Midge Scannell from ACC-PARC.
Union people stated their concern for their own members who were jeopardized and for the other residents who were endangered. They were ’’forced” to picket to publicize their plight. Union may initiate "Right to Treatment" suit.
Dr. Scott accepted responsibility for the situation and stated that little could be done to minimize the effect of such disturbances because of:
1.	Inadequate staff
2.	Great amount of absenteeism on part of staff. She must schedule 7^ workers to ensure that 3 will actually report for work.
3.	Volunteers cannot be relied on to achieve any positive effects because of sporadic participation.
Dr. Scott spoke of transferring the resident to another facility, possibly Mayview or Woodville.
Midge Scannell suggested that:
1.	Transfer to these facilities seems inappropriate as PARC staff reports that Eddie seems unmanagable only when there is insufficient activity to involve his total participation.
2.	Transfer to these facilities may preclude the resident from participating in the PARC workshop.
3.	The kind of sensational reporting that appeared regarding the picketing was detrimental to the development of normalization programs of community residences and service programs.
Result of Meeting: No solution was found to the problem of Eddie’s periodic outbursts. Dr. Scott would not state what her plans were— if, in fact, she has any.
