Dear Ms. Wohlgemuth,
I am a Special Education teacher and h-ave a severely living at Polk State School. Therefore, I feel more than express my great distress caused by your recent firing of superintendent of Polk State School.
retarded daughter
Qualified to
Dr. JamES McClelland,

Your ahrupt action indicates to me that you have very little intimate knowledge of severely and profoundly retarded children and adults. There are individuals who require close supervision and partial confinement in a playpen-like enclosure for their safety and the safety of others. This is not cruel and inhumane, it is sensible action taken for safety. Some of the children and adults do reouire rather heavy medication at various times because of severely aggressive hehavior.
It is my opinion, and the opinion of various professional persons that I have discussed this matter with, that partial confinement used in conjunction with some medication is far preferable, more humane, and more sensible course of action. This gives aides and teachers the opportunity to work with and try to help the residents.

Play pens are used by many oarents of young children to keeo them safe and not isolated. Many residents of Polk are still very young children though they are physically mature.
My daughter is and has been receiving excellent care at Polk. Dr. McClelland is responsible for a fine program of high Quality care for all the patients in his care. I do not understand how you can possibly charge him with inhumane treatment. He could not Dossiblv have held his position at’ Polk as administrator for so long a time or be so highly respected by his employees, parents of patients, professionals is his field,-and many other people^ if your charges were true.

I believe that you h my sincere wish that you instate Dr. McClelland at gram which is progressive and best interests of its
ave made a very serious error in judgement. It is reconsider this extremely serious decision and re-Polk so that he can continue to administer a pro-
, thoughtful, residents.
and has great concern for the welfare
