Dear Secretary Wohlgemuth:
I would be gravely remiss in my responsibilities as a professional nurse and as a resident of Northwestern Pennsylvania if I failed to communicate to you ray strong support of your decision to dismiss Dr. James McClelland, superintendent at Polk State School and Hospital.
Many health professionals throughout Pennsylvania, and especially in our area, have long been aware of the archaic and punitive practices employed by personnel at Polk in the name of "acceptable or safe" treatment. We are equally cognizant of Senator Frame’s numerous attempts to dilute quality health care by supporting unsound health education programs and health delivery practices.
Unfortunately your concerned and courageous action will undoubtedly be rewarded by a wave of vigorous protest and personal attack from certain "vested interest" groups. Throughout the onslaught I do hope that you will remember that you have an equally large but relatively "silent" group of supporters.
Sincerely,
Dr. Dorothy J. Novello
Chairman
Division of Nursing
Chairman
State Board of Nurse Examiners
