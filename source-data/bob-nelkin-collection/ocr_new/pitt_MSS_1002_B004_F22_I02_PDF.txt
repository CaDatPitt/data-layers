Dear Secretary Wohlgemuth:
/
The immediate dismissal of Dr. James H. McClelland, Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital, and the manner and wording given as reasons for his release are not justified or applicable to a dedicated administrator and community leader.
The Franklin Area Chamber of Commerce is concerned as to the treatment of the patients and also realizes that the variety of patients under care cannot be equally supervised.
We are certain Dr. McClelland would conform to whatever new policy or criteria that would be established for unusual patients; thus eliminating the necessity for the abrupt and provocative dismissal .
While the Chamber takes no issue in dismissal of personnel from time to time, we believe this move was unjust and lacked consideration.
Sincerely,
A. T. McClure, President
