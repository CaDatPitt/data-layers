Dear Ginny:
Thank you for bringing to my attention the very serious conditions at Western State School and Hospital which have resulted in past accidents and deaths.
It disturbs me that the poor quality of care provided residents at the institution has become intolerable, as evidenced in the summary of case histories which you provided me.
My correspondence tc^h^Hil tner concerning the difficulty which Mrs. [MHhad encountered in placing her son at the in^CTiftion was for the purpose of clarifying the background of conditions which have created an unfavorable climate for further admissions to Western State School.
I sincerely support your continuing efforts to monitor activities at Western State School and Hospital in the hope of insuring the best possible care for its residents.
With best wishes,
terme^t^personal regards,
phn Heinz III, M.C.
