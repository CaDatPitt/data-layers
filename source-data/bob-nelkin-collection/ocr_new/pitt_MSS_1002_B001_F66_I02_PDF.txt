2.	Child Care Aides - 2 part-time night personnel with associate degrees from AI Iegheny Communi ty College - Child Development Program.
Whether one is a Child Care Worker or Child Care Aide depends on years of employment not educational level. Salaries and job descriptions are currently under discussion. The need for In-service training is apparent.
3.	Staff Ratio - 2 to 8 children during the day and I to 8 at night. (Night aides are not to sleep but to clean, wash clothes and take children to the potty.) Three workers are on duty from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, also during certain periods on Monday and Friday.
Other Assorted Facts (suggested by the staff)
1.	It is difficult to find clothing that looks well on Ingrid and to keep George, who spits up often, looking neat.
2.	Ms. Patty from the Pennsylvania Fellowship Plan will supply three volunteers to I diewood.
3.	The Admissions Committee should stress family involvement in the future. The staff is not sure under what criteria the committee operates. (In the past, the staff viewed Idlewood as a "dumping ground.")
4.	The Board of Directors, chaired by ERic Whitman from WSSH, consists of primari ly professionals. At least one Idlewood parent is on it.
5.	Individual staff are assigned to attend PTA meetings at each school or center.
6.	The Pediatrician on call is Sylvia Bartos, who works at the Home for Crippled Ch i Idren.
7.	One staff member said of Idlewood: "This kind of a home seems so natural and logical.”
Recurring Concerns
1.	Is there any basis for reports from the community (such as other parents from West End Center) that the Idlewood children are frequently shabbily dressed i n pub Iic?
2.	Who is responsible for licensing Group Homes? Is this license renewed yearly? Do unannounced inspections occur by the licensing agent? Under what regulations do the Group Homes in Allegheny County operate?
3.	Can a Group Home be licensed when it is in clear violation of safety standards (such as raw boards exposed on bathroom floor, broken glass, exposed plugs and toilets without tops)?
