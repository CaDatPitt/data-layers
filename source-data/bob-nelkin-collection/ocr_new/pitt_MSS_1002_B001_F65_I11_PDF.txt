Dear Chuck:
I agree with your assessment of MrjH^B1 s letter, a copy of which you forwarded to me. It does seem inappropriate to prohibit private use of a telephone between residents in a state facility (including Folk) and their families. As a matter of Fact, this will be one of the rights in the "Bill of Rights" for the mentally retarded in institutions and private licensed facilities.
With regard to Polk State School and Hospital, we will instruct Dr. McClelland to review and appropriately revise his rule to permit use of a private pay telephone.
I am referring your letter with attachments along with my letter to you to my staff. They will follow-up with Dr. McClelland.
Thank you for referring this information to us.
Sincerely,

Ralph L. Meador
Commissioner
Mental Health and Mental Retardation
