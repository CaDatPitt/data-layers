“The considerable venerated by plaintiffs consultants’ report makes it necessary for me to assure the families of Pen-fiurst residents that the clients there are not medically at risk,” she said.
O’BANNON held the press conference prior to today’s federal court hearing on charges that Pennhurst does not provide adequate health care. Families of Pennhurst residents have ’’’ed the Commonwealth.
The consultants’ report contains a “substantial number of factual errors,’’ ’.e secretary said. She said that the report is no longer valid because steps 1 'Ve been taken to improve medical care at Pennhurst.
She cited what she said were two <‘ciual inadequacies in that report, one being that the death rate at the facility high by national standards, and the .)! .er being charges of medical neglect.
She refuted the first charge with a enes of statistics. She said that 1.6 per '00 patients died, whereas the national erage is 1.5, which she said wasn’t iad considering that the patients are nore medically involved than other >atients at institutions. She added that he report suggests forcing of fluids into ■' ;ents — a matter which Dr. Phillip ■ng, medical consultant for the Jepartment of Welfare, said was xaggerated.
