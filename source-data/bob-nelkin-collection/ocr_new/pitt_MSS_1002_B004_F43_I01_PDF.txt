Dear Mr. Nelkin,
Mrs. Calloway, Deputy Secretary, Western Region, Department of Public
Welfare, has asked me to respond to your letter of May 27, 1976, relating to current plans to expand the Polk Dispersal Project.
You are probably aware of the fact that the Polk Dispersal Project
was to be a continuous one until the population at Polk State School and Hospital was reduced to approximately 1,400 residents. We are in the process of planning for the acquisition of additional, smaller facilities operating on the same principle as the current annexes of Polk State School and Hospital. In addition to this, I have personally requested Mr. John Ligato, our Regional Community Residential Programs Representative, to channel all possible resources into planning for the dispersal of residents from Polk State School and Hospital into Community Living Arrangements.
Recognizing the current fiscal constraints we are forced to operate
under, it is highly inappropriate to plan for expenditures in the millions of dollars at this point in time. We are, however, continuing our efforts to develop plans that will have a definite impact on the immediate reduction of the census at Polk State School and Hospital. Granted, this could be done by attrition, however it would probably take two or three years to reach our goal.
When we are negotiating for the acquisition of facilities to house
residents dispersed from Polk State School and Hospital, it is important to maintain a low profile in order that the cost would not accelerate thereby operating in direct contradiction to what we are trying to accomplish. When the negotiations have reached the stage where we feel finalization of the contract is possible without adversely affecting our plans, we will be happy to share this information with you.

Please be assured that in our efforts to secure additional facilities to relieve the over-crowding at Polk State School and Hospital, we will exert all efforts to provide the transfered residents with a more humane and beneficial setting and programming as you indicated in the last paragraph of your letter.
if there is any additional information that I can give you in this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
LA J: dm cc: Mrs. Anna Belle Calloway
