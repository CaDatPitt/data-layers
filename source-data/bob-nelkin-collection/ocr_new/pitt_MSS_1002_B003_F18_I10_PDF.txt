
WESTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL
LIAISON COMMITTEE
December 19, 1974

Meeting was called by Western State School and Hospital parents - critical	quality, quantity, and effectiveness
of food service.
Gen. McLain represented the Parent's Group. Specifically charged "no one is responsible for food service at place it is delivered to residents". "Food is ineditable." "Menu is catch as catch can." "No real planned snack in the evening."
Mrs. McLain - not enough employees - only one supervisor to go around to meals to check on quality.
Mrs. McLain - "morning person (dietary) orders food is unaware of capability of residents to eat."
Torisky - cottage (Beech) residents have fresh greens only twice a week at the most.
McKenna - has prepared a memo - to the WSSH administration: food is tasteless, unappetizing, would not feed my child, or would not eat myself. Great discrepancy between doctors in institution on mechanical diet^and finger food. One attendant said to me today - "within six months, the residents will not be able to chew.
Everything is ground. Everything is dog meat. The food served on Pine (hyperactive individuals), attendants complained not enough food. Children acting like wild animals rummaging through garbage for food.
Out of food - Pine III had not eaten yet. Only once^per person (hyperactive full-grown males). Went through serving line -little food value. Lettuce major portion of the meal, out of vegetables.
I was informed by Pine III - total weight loss from 11/18 to 12/18, 6-11 pounds per person. I went to records to validate alleged weight loss. Doctor submitted order asking for additional nourishment on this unit because of weight loss. The food is exotic - coconut juices (doubt the residents have a taste for this). Joe McKenna willing to give name of nurse who would complain. On Monday they had^burger bits'/ as appetizing as eating linoleum off the floor. Macroni cold, sticky, stale, and not even butter on it. I would not eat it or feed it to my child. Today they had ham with barbecue and macroni with butter, it was decent.

Teachers are upset about food for residents. In the staff, dietary serving sandwiches because there is a lack of food. What is the planning that has brought this shortage about? A bite size tray, in my opinion, is what is put on a fork, not what is put on a spoon. You cannot teach a child to have table manners, to eat with the family out in a restaurant, home, or amusement park if we are grinding up their food here. This is their training. If we don't have utensils, how can we train people to eat with utensils. We were not provided with utensils, only plastic forks. I don't want to serve baby food to a 18 year old who tomorrow can go out and get a job. A doctor should know what the various trays are, that he/she are ordering. Too many times we blame local institutions. How much money for food is being allocated for food per year? Are we getting nourishing diets or an appetizing diet? I want food that the residents like. I want nourishment that isn't just calories. I want snacks that they like.
McKenna - still -
Torisky - what's the solution?
McKenna - give them as much food as they need regardless of diet".
Torisky - who is responsible?
McKenna - I will give Hiltner and Scott the names of people who will testify.
Mrs. Webb responded to Mr. Hiltner's question: Is the problem insufficient budget for food? Have you ever been turned down? "No."

Send purchase orders to purchasing agent. Our shortages are foods bid on a state-wide level (fruits, vegetables, potatoes, spaghetti, dehydrated food). Our procurement office orders through the Department of Properties and Supplies. I have never been aware that several orders of green beans would be substituted and served when there are no potatoes.
Dr. Scott said dietary^knew two days in advance they are getting out of potatoes - low on potatoes - called to dietary office -no substitute was sent over so double orders of green beans was served.^ We did not
■Were--not short of food, have a lack of staff.
go to soup and sandwiches because we Soup and sandwiches served because we
Hiltner - certain items we are short of because of state^fujuding.
Mrs. Webb - food is being thrown away right now. There is not a shortage on Pine right now.

Levinson - can foods are being cancelled. Producers can’t meet the orders. A purchase requisition to the state delays food to 90 days from order/S/^/^.
Mrs. Webb - prepares menu based on what is expected in when menu comes up. On the fruits and vegetables - I would like to serve every day. I am not serving them because individuals say these vegetables and fruits cause diarrhea.
Porcara - nurses do have the power to eliminate things from the menu.
Bradley - it is not a matter of principle to eliminate raw vegetables and fruits.
Mrs. Webb - blamed nurses for not getting a Xmas list to the dietary. Joe McKenna says he got it the same day.
Gen. McLain - these are internal problems that you folks should damn well solve.
Mrs. Webb - we are picking the gristle off of the meat at this point.
Mrs. Webb - why do we have to cut french fries up into pieces* With good teeth in children we are pulverizing oranges to orange juice because people are scared.
McKenna - turkey could be spread on bread.
Scott - why all food to Pine going through the cuber? Who ordered diced foods?
Mrs. Webb - cook doing butchers work grounded and not cubed. pbW't'tcf
s why the turkey was
Hiltner - chain of command has been subverted so often. The nurse will be responsible for designating food sizes that people can handle. Medical doctor will be responsible for special diets.
Nelkin - if you oppose oranges being cut up, why are you doing it? If you oppose food being pulverized, why are you doing it?
Mrs. Webb - I was ordered to.
Nelkin to Levinson - are you Mrs. Webb’s supervisor? Did you order these changes? Are you aware who made the changes?
Levinson - yes, no, no.
Levinson - only one solution - centralized tray preparation can eliminate problems.

H. Goldberg - is there enough food?	.	,
Hiltner -jwd 11 send out procedural changes and a oh an ge of flcmanrH to th^cOTrnru-ttee.
Mrs. Webb - all you have to do is request utensils and you will get them.
Hiltner - what we need is more individualization which	more
staff.
Scott - how do they get baby food in large cans all the time at Children's Hospital and not here?
Hiltner - give us two months for memo to Liaison Committee.
Goldberg - does anyone taste the food? Are condiments being sent to the lodges?
Mrs. Webb - yes, (who?)^^u^S?J^mdijnlnts to units. Given to residents when residents request it.
Goldberg - State Representative Laughlin trying to find where $3,000,000 distribution is? He has been assured distribution will be out soon.
Mrs. Webb - 3ounces of meat noon -	ounces meat dinner.
All units have to do is request a double order.
Scott - last Monday night (Beech), there was not enough potatoes.
Masterson - tasted daughter's food. Would not serve it to her at home. I wouldn't give it to a dog.
Mother - tried to cut meat and couldn't cut roast beef.
Dietician - its up to superintendent to make sure gross problems are being resolved.
Nelkin - 1) nothing new has been brought up tonight.
2)	we are being asked to have faith (blind faith).
3)	no reason to have faith: no answers presented tonight and no answers in the past.
McKenna and Webb blew up at each other about lunches the I.U. is provid^j^/.	I
Hiltner was questioned by Alice Goldberg about why we have to wait two months for a report.
