In re: Doctor James H. McClelland, his dismissal

I vehemently deplore your uncouth and vulgar manner in summarily discharging Doctor James H. McClelland, a conscientious and dedicated public servant.
As stated by letter to the Governor of this date I am perfectly familiar with the unquestioned professional reputation and actual accomplishments of the Superintendent of Polk. I am curious as to your qualifications and motives. I am sure that this episode will shed some light on this matter.

it shall have disastrous political consequences to the Governor and as an active Democrat, interested in advancing the Democratic Party within the State, I consider this action a calamity for my
