r,:-r DECISION TO PETITION FOR STAYS OF PENNHURST ORDERS. WE BELIEVE YOUR
■' ADMINISTRATION HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THE PENNHURST SITUATION
• AROUND BY IMPLEMENTING THE BRADERICK ORDERS. YOUR ACTION, HOWEVER, IS /ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE AND WILL BE VIEWED AS SUCH BY THOSE WHO ARE
COMMITTED TO THE OBJECTIVE OF DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION.
■ ■■ IN VIEW OF CONCERNS WE MADE KNOWN TO YOU IN MY JULY 1 1 TH LETTER, WE ARE DISTURBED THAT YOU MADE THE DECISION WITHOUT ALLOWING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOU. YOU RECENTLY CRITICIZED PRESIDENT
SF-12O1 (R«9J	'
‘’/ WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF INDEPENDENT STATION OPERATORS WHEN HE WAS IN
C' }’; PITTSBURGH. IF YOU FEEL THAT CONSULTATION IS THIS IMPORTANT, DON'T WE MERIT IT AS MUCH AS THE GASOLINE OPERATORS?
/■’ WEN YOU SPOKE TO OUR CONVENTION, YOU SAID WE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A
<■	FRIEND IN HARRISBURG AS LONG AS YOU ARE IN OFFICE. I'M AFRAID OUR
MEMBERS WILL BE SKEPTICAL LOF (THIS ASSURANCE IN VIEW OF WHAT WE HAVE
■ LEARNED TODAY.	'	"	'	'	.	’
