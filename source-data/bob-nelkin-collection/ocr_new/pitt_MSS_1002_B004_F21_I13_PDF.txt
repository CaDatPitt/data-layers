Dear Sir:
I am writing this letter in regards to the action taken by the State Welfare Secretary, Mrs. Helene Aohlgemuth to fire Dr. James H. McClelland of Polk State School in Polk, Pa.
I have hesitated in writing a letter until I had a chAn^e to view both sides of this issue and am now prepared to defend Dr. McClelland.
I myself have visited the Polk School located in Polk, Pa. as a visitor on a tour. I observed natients of various ages and mental capacities. On the tour, visitors were not nermitted to view the agre3sive patients for our own safety.
I truly believe that if the thousands of school employees and staff as wel as many local and county organizations are fully supporting this man and his nosition in his duties as head of the school, then I can see no inhumane intention toward any of his patients in the procedure of using the so-called ’’cages” for the aggressive patients. The use or the playpens are much more appealing to me than the use of straight jackets or the injection of drugs.
As a young mother of a 5-month old son, I would hove no objection to admitting my son or any other child to Folk State School and under the supervision of Dr. McClelland, if the occasion were that the child needed the attention ~»f such staff at a mental school and home.
The mere fact that the cages thehselves were on public display and not hidden fron view is fact enough to me that the school was doing the right thing in using them for specific patients.
I'm sure that Dr. McClelland and his staff is and has been investigating different means of protecting the aggressive patient and yet allowing them some onen-ness to the rest of the patients at the school.
For the above reason, I sincerely hone that you will attempt
to do all you can to reinstat professional character as Sup
Copy to:
Mrs. Helene A’ohlgemuth
State Welfare Secretary
Harrisburg, Pa. 17199
Dr. McClelland and orotect his rinten^ent of Polk School.
Sincerely,
Carol M. Haugh (Mrs.)
