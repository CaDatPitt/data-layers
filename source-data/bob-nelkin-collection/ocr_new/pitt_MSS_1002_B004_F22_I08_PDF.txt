Subject: Dr. James H. McClelland, Jr.,
Superintendent, Polk State School and Hospital
Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
I was shocked to learn of your irresponsible dismissal of Dr. Jam«3 E. McClelland as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital on April 17, 1975*
I am writing this simple letter in an attempt to express my humble feelings for the gratitude, honor, and respect that I hold for this great man. He has my vote of confidence in everything that he does for the operation of the School.
My daughter has been a patent at Polk State School ar.d Hospital for the past twelve years and I have had many conversations with Dr. McClelland during this time. We parents of retarded children know the measures that are necessary to oontrol the lives of God’s "special" children.
How many retarded children have you raised, Mrs. Wohlgemuth? Perhaps you should "Walk a mile in our moccasins" before you pass judgment on something you do rot know.
Bectuse cf Dr. McClelland’s lifetime dedicated leadership in this field, I know that Folk Stet* School and Hospital is the fin*st in the State of Porn-aylvania and, indeed, one of the best in the Nation.
Fleas® try to understand the real problems of operating this institution from those who must participate—the pataut, the staff, and the par*nts--for life, willingly or not, under constant political end financial stress.
It may be difficult for you to realize that even the patients hold a high respect and honor in their own way for Dr. McClelland and this I have seen for myself. Sven a "vegetable" responds to loving, tender care and this is what is dispensed under Dr. McClelland’s leadership.
I beg you to reconsider the situation for the injustice that will be done by removing this dedicated man from a position where he is so badly needed.
I have already contacted the local chapter of the FARC, talked with several parents of retarded children residing at Polk State School and Hospital, and will continue in my efforts to see that Dr. McClelland is reinstated, A copy of this letter is being sent to our local newspaper and to Governor Shapp.
May God bless you and keep yo i until you are better informed.
