Haigh Executive Assistant for Programs Department of Public Welfare Health & Welfare Building, Room 308 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17120 Dear Bob: Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the recent meeting at Polk State School. Even though the participants are not preparing formal reports, there are a few informal observations and comments I would like to make. Although I have visited Polk on two previous occasions, you must bear in mind that these comments are based on rather limited direct observations of the current situation at Polk State School. The thing which seemed most obvious during our visit was an immediate and critical need _to establish appro-priate goals for this facilitv. Obviouslv the estaB-lishment of goals will include regular individual assessment and individual program plans for every resident. A random review of records would seem to justify the charge that Polk State School is a "custodial place". The second major observation is one which has become apparent to everyone - the need for more effective delegation of administrative authority. While the line of authority from the Commissioner of Mental Retardation seems fractured and ineffective in terms of his direct responsibility for institutional programs, the administration within the institution is rigid and unresponsive to individuals. The cumbersome bureaucratic nature of the present system seems to prevent a rapid response to program needs. There is no doubt in my mind that a cross-disciplinary approach to program development is essential, but such a team approach could not function without greater delegation of administrative authority. I was alarmed by the fact that members of the direct- Twenty-Fourth Annual Meeting Anaheim, California	October 31 - November 3, 1973

care staff seemed totally ignorant of the "off-ward" activities in which residents participated. In both educational and therapeutic programs it is essential that the staff members who spend the greatest amount of time with residents understand how to reinforce and implement these other programs. If the livingunit personnel are ignorant of the other activities, as they appear to be, it is evidence that they are not included in the planning process.
At this point it is useless to consider the question of low staff/resident ratios since that is only used as justification for continuing the status quo. Individualized program plans are essential for a legitimate justification to increase the number of staff. I will not comment at length here on the obvious need to disperse a major portion of the resident population at Polk; you are already alert to that need. It would be of enormous benefit to the school and to the Department of Public Welfare for the institution to immediately begin theself- ?
study phase of
The results of that study, With UL wiLliuuL a fcrTlow-up site visit by the accreditation survey team, would provide very specific information regarding areas which require change.
The third major point I wish to make relates to the total institutional situation. My observations of many different institutions have resulted in the firm conviction that the prevailing value system must be confronted before appropriate programs can be implemented. The staff at Polk evidenced very little conceptual awareness of any need for change or understandings of why developmental programs are necessary•
It is apparent that the initial step necessitates a firm philosophical and programmatic commitment by top administration to a developmental model of service delivery. To be effective this commitment must come from the Department of Public Welfare in Harriburg as well as from the superintendent’s office at Polk State School. The commitment must be written in simple behavioral terms and then distributed to the entire staff, to parents and to the community. A simplistic commitment "to go forth

and do good1’ is hardly what I have in mind. The statement needs to be one which firmly presents the Commonwealth's philosophy and position regarding services for its mentally retarded citizens who may require residential programs for some greater or lesser period during their lives.
When a formal written commitment has been made (one which can be understood by everyone) then the overall goals for Polk, or any other institution, can be easily written. The next step is to institute a staff development program designed to transform some basic attitudes of staff members about themselves, their peers and especially those attitudes which govern their interactions with the mentally retarded residents.
Unfortunately, the majority of Inservice Training programs have focused upon task-oriented skills which were either irrelevant to the developmental needs of the population being served or were in open conflict with the institution’s prevalent value system. During the past six years I have given special attention to the way in which Inservice Training projects have functioned and it is impressive to note the general failure of these projects to secure long term changes in the delivery of program services.
In my opinion most ’staff training programs have centered upon two major strategies which are doomed to failure since they are antagonistic to the basic nature of human development. The first of these can be labeled Curative Strategies.
The historical evolution of institutional management explains in many ways why so much energy and resources have been placed in efforts to cure or ameliorate developmental disabilities through medical intervention. The magical expectations centered on the various therapies and the heavy reliance upon drugs has, over time, resulted in awesome frustrations and a predictable sense of helplessness among both professionals and direct care personnel. While one cannot question either the ongoing need for appropriate medical intervention or for necessary hygiene,

these efforts frequently result in little more than "custodial sanitation11 if the personnel view the situation as developmentally hopeless. It is this atmosphere of hopelessness and the overwhelming sense of impotence which causes program failure. I have written at some length of the consequences	~
inherent- -in, a "medical model" and have enclosed
^reprints of those
The second staff training approach has been a focus upon Control-Oriented Strategies. It can be hypothesized that the general sense of hopelessness has, in part, been responsible for teaching personnel to use controlling strategies on what they perceive to be a deviant and de-valued population. Most control strategies inevitably degenerate into highly punitive responses in the long run. The reason for the long term program failure is related to the fact that these control strategies are unnatural and developmentally inappropriate.
A constructive approach to staff development is essential if we are to break the institutional stereotype. The traditional inservice educator, has, unfortunately, been rather ignorant of the principles of adult education. Adults cannot be successfully taught by the traditional techniques of pedagogy and it is high time we recognized the limitations we place upon staff training when we ignore this fact. The Department needs to invest its concern in providing a sound approach to staff development.
It appears that the situation at Polk State School is an opportunity for the Department of Public Welfare to take immediate constructive action to assure future program success. The institution is currently undergoing a confrontational crisis and is therefore more subject to change at this point than it will be after the crisis has passed. The literature of crisis intervention should serve you well at this point. Hopefully the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will use this unique opportunity wisely.
