Dear Mrs. Sattler:	•*	‘
I am responding to your request for Polk State School1s reaction to the comparatively recent visit of Allegheny County’s Base Service Units.
First, let me say that the group of people that came, although large in number, conducted themselves in a very professional and courteous manner towards the residents and our staff. They are a credit to Allegheny County.	\
By them spending the time here, we sincerely believe that they are now 'in a much better position of understanding our problems and those of the .residents. Through that understanding, our contacts with them are much more productive and when we express a concern or seek services in their area, there is a mutual trust that we are acting in the best interest of
•	the resident. That may or may not have been true in some instances prior
to the visit.	”
There now seems to be a much more aggressive exploration for group homes or foster homes. There will probabiy be a definite improvement in placements ove? the past record.	• ...	•	•	.
A major benefit is that the Base Service Unit has now seen, and . . touched, and become aware of the special needs here, and this experience has not died out upon the termination of the visit. The staff is now more personally concerned and committed, and as they pursue their role of advocate, and as we continue to supply them with information they request , and with information we see as being valuable to them, the working. relationship will become closer and closer.	. • ’	. . • •
There is a hope that the Base Service Unit -will be able to 6ring changes in the parts of our system that are not responsive to internal prodding.	• • •
•	• We feel that there was a realization on the part of the group that
they were not providing. much in the way of services for ’the residents of Folk who ca-.e from ■	mnty, -winch would eventually lead the resident
back to •	3 - ?sti ii; ’ environment.

They were a distinct catalyst for our staff as they questioned entries in the records or lack of certain programs. The exit interview also served as a very objective appraisal of what problems or concerns they had identified while they were here..	•
In summary, the visit was.worthwhile and necessary- and the person-to-person contact should continue. Periodic visits to Polk should be an integral part of a Base Service Unit’s yearly routine.
