Background:
The meeting was a direct result of a joint ACC/DPW action at
Mountain Top^ Interim Care Facility for mentally retarded on October 18 19 and 20 which resulted in the closing of the facility.
Agreement: ACC understands DPW's concern that the precipitous closina of interim care facilities may result in the transfere of interim care residents to State schools and hospitals that are already overcrowded and where inadequate provision is made for their care and treatment. Conversely, DPW recognizes that some interimvcare facilities have such a negative effect on residents that transfere of residents to State schools and hospitals, even if they are of questionable quality, is of critical importance.
Accordingly, the ACC Board of Directors will continue to visit . those interim car^ facilities where Allegheny County residents are housed for the express purpose of bringing conditions (good or bad) at the interim care facilities to the attention of the Office of Mental Retardation. In the event conditions are found that are detrimental t the residents, ACC will immediately advise the Office of Mental
Retardation.
based on ACC's information and their own immediate investigation, the Office of Mental Retardation in consultation with ACC will make a decision to close the offending facility or attempt to salvage it.
• T •
* *
In the event a salvage effort is undertaken, the Office of. Mental Retardation will immediately, within.24 hours, move adequate staff into the facility to provide sufficient technical staff assistance to improve either/or both plant and program.
At the time of such intervention a contingency plan for removal residents will be developed in conjunction with the County MH/MR program where the residents reside. This contingency plan to include individual evaluation of all residents.
ACC specifically reserves the right to revisit the facility following
DPW intervention to determine if improvement has occurred. In the event improvement has not occurred, ACC reserves the right to take unilateral action, including but not limited to notification of the news media.
It must be emphasized that if this- procedure malfunctions at any ooint, ACC will act in a manner determined best for the residents involved. ’	v
