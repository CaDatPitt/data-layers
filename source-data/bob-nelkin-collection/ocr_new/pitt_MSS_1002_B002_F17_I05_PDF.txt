RE:	Halderman v. Pennhurst
No. 74-1345
Dear Judge Broderick:
As you know, the Commonwealth defendants have initiated discussions seeking to negotiate an agreed schedule and format for full implementation of this Court’s Order of March 17,	1978. Dr. Jennifer Howse and our attorneys met
with the other parties throughout last week in that effort. Dr. Howse presented the Department’s proposal which, based upon her experience, she considered a responsible blueprint for delivering quality community services on a realistic schedule.
