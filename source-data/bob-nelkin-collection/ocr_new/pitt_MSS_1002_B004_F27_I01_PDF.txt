In addition, a full-time Volunteer Services Director has been appointed and will begin to initiate an in-service training program for volunteers. An active recruitment program for volunteers from nearby communities and service groups will also be initiated.
A Bar Mitzvah— the first in Polk’s history, will be held on
November 25th at Paole Zedek Temple in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The candidates have been receiving instruction from Rabbi Heber of the Polk staff, with assistance from volunteer staff. Parents, friends, and relatives will be invited to attend.
