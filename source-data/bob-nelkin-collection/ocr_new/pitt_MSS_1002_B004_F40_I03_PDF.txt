Dear Norman,
Our Residential Care Committee is appalled that new admissions are being accepted at Polk State School and Hospital. Why did you let this occur?
Did the Department use all its resources to fight the court admission? Did high-level Department officials testify to Polk’s inability to deliver proper care and treatment for this individual? Did Department officials arrange and propose funding for an alternative program for this individual? Did the Department have qualified legal counsel to present the case in opposition to admission? Did the Department offer expert testimony from knowledgeable consultants on the potential danger of this admission?
Regardless of the Department’s willingness or unwillingness to vigorously fight this court admission, we would have tried. Why didn’t you call on us to help? Any admission to Polk defeats your goals for the Polk Dispersal Project. Why can’t the Department (your office) take a firm stand and try to win? Why are we breaking our necks trying to reduce the Polk population when you are permitting new admissions?
The Honorable Norman Taylor Page 2
We are disappointed and angered.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Virginia Thornburgh President
ACC-PARC Residential Care Committee
