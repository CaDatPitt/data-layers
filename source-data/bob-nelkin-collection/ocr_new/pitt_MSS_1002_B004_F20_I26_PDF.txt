Dear Govenor Shapp,
I have visited Polk State School and I know some of the employees of the school. I have never heard anything but praise for the type of treatment and oonaem that Dr, McClelland shows each and every patient in his care. 18m sure it means a great deal to a retarded ocrnon to bo treated as a person, and as a person with a name, not as an inaminate object.
I have served on the board of Easter Seal with Dr, McClelland and have found him c >ncened for the weIfpre of all those he comes in contact with.
As a lifelong resident of Venango County, I know that Dr, McClelland has constantly tried texpose patients to the communityand the community to them through such projects as the music gr >uos at Polk. sTate School, in working out a program with Venango County Vocational Teohinal School , encouraged urograms and birthday parties put on by vnx-ious churches' and civic groups who mingle with the oat tents at the school. The annual circus day has always osen locked forward to by those cored for by Polk State School and by the employees there as they know how much it me 113 co the atients. Dr. McClelland worked hard to retain the farm at the school, as he felt the farm experience oenefitted s• many of chose in his cure.
I believe that a school and hospital as large as Polk needs an exceptional suoe intendant. I also believe this job should be above PDlitios. I do not know Mrs. Wohlgemuth’s nor Mrs. Elkin’s training nor qualifications for judging Dr. McClelland, but I do protest what I believe to be the unjust and undeserved firing of a qualified doctor of the highest integrity and finest principals who has devoted years of concerned treatment to those in his care.
