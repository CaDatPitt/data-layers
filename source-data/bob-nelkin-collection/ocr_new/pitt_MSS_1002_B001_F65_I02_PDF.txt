Virginia Thornburgh: First Vice President of ACC-PARC;
Chairman of ACC-PARC's State School and 'V.
Hospital and Interim Care Committee; mother of a retarded child.
History:
In June of 1972, concerned that the Department of Public Welfare was not adequately serving the retarded under their jurisdiction, ACC-PARC's Board of Directors charged its State School and Hospital and Interim Care Committee to re-activate visitations to MR facilities in the western region. The death of Richard Hissim at Ridge View Center prompted several on-site inspections of this facility...with requests
■
to DPW after each visitation that the facility be closed. These requests were ignored. The death of Louis Novak at Ridge View reinforced the local chapter's fears for the care of Allegheny County residents placed in. facilities throughout the State...and a public pledge was
r
made in August to monitor all facilities housing mentally retarded children cind adults from Allegheny County.
Mrs. Thornburgh visited the following facilities that.have recently been in the news: Ridge View, Mountain Top, Polk.
