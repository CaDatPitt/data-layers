Dear Bob,
While visiting Western State School and Hospita^^ on Thursday, January 9, 1975, I observed Tony M^^^H at lunch time. Tony was marched into the dining room by a child care aide. The child care aide held Tony's arms from behind and pushed him the whole length of the dining room to a table. Within two minutes, the procedure was reversed and Tony was being pushed out of the dining room. At a moment or two later, Tony was seen running down the hallway into the dining room clad only in under shorts. He grabbed another resident's lunch and stuffed it into his mouth. The child care aide chased after Tony and eventually returned him to the bathroom of the unit.

A half an hour later when Tony had not returned to the dining room to finish his lunch, I asked an attendant on his unit (John) when Tony was going to receive his lunch. He said Tony had received lunch and that he eats very fast and had gulped his meal down in a minute.
I doubt that Tony was given an opportunity to eat this lunch meal. If he was given an opportunity to eat the meal, he wasn't properly supervised to eat the meal slowly.
Tony is an individual who has lost a great deal of weight during various periods of the past couple of years. Is he being fed properly?
Sincerely,
RN:cp
