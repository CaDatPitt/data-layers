RE:	DPW News Release
The enclosed news release covers a number of items of proposed action in the interest of the mentally retarded of Pennsylvania.
As indicated there are to be review teams in each MH/MR Administrative area to inspect and evaluate private licensed facilities for the mentally retarded. If your chapter has not been contacted, please take immediate steps to contact the MH/MR Administrator to be sure there are PARC representatives on the local inspection teams.
At the State level, there is to be a statewide Review and Training Team. I have asked the following persons to serve: Mrs. Eleanor Elkin, Mrs. J.J. Isherwood, Mrs. Alice Goldberg and Mrs. Ruth Levey.
It is evident that it has taken extreme and unusual circumstances to get this motion and reaction by state government. It is imperative that we be diligent in pursuing this matter until all of the mentally retarded have appropriate facilities and programs in every part of the Commonwealth. If the PARC office can provide you with any information or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Special inspections of the licensed private mental retardation facilities providing interim care for the mentally retarded were announced today by Public Welfare Secretary Helene Wohlgemuth as part of a vigorous statewide drive to improve services for the retarded.
"We are deeply and sincerely committed to improving and enhancing the lives of the retarded in Pennsylvania and in fulfilling that commitment we seek the cooperation and involvement of any interested group,” Mrs. Wohlgemuth said.
Private organizations of parents and other concerned individuals, community groups and specialists in a wide range of human services will participate in the program improvements, which include the transfer of 830 patients from Pennhurst State School and Hospital, action on the group home program which may now use residential-type buildings, and regulations with strong enforcement teeth.
The evaluation of private licensed facilities will be conducted through the Department’s four regional offices during the month of October. Immediate corrective action will be taken where indicated.
Interim facilities are used for the care and training of the retarded waiting admission to state inr\iuutions. Community programs and the use of group homes are expected to drastically reduce the waiting list, Mrs. Wohlgemuth said.

The independent review teams will evaluate the facilities on functional capacity to provide safe, healthful and socially desirable services; to program effectively in keeping with the individually defined needs of patients, and the potential for continued use for interim care purposes.
Consisting of not more than 12 persons, the review teams will include
a county mental health and mental retardation program specialist, a Department regional institutional standards representative, a regional mental retardation specialist, a social worker and physician from the county assistance office, representatives of the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children and other parent and consumer groups, a community legal service representative, a representative of the Pennsylvania Association of Residences for the Retarded, and representatives of referral agencies.

Team members will attend training workshops prior to visiting the facilities.
Other phases of the Department’s upgrading of services to the retarded include:
—Provision of educational and training programs to all school-age children under the jurisdiction of the Department in state institutions. The ’’Right to Education” court mandate will be fully complied with as the first program of its kind in the nation. The Department’s activities in this area are carried out under'1 the supervision of the Department of Education.
—Development of a new approach in the field of mental retardation at the Southeastern State School and Hospital, Philadelphia, in a joint arrangement with Temple University. The institution, scheduled to open next spring, will provide services for 36O persons with developmental disabilities and will serve as a training area for new career professionals to work with the handicapped.
