The Honorable Milton J. Shapp Governor of Pennsylvania State Capitol
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
Dear Governor Shapp:
As concerned professionals we want to voice our opinions concerning the dismissal of Dr. James H. McClelland, Superintendent of Polk State
School & Hospital, Polk, Pa. We are strongly opposed to this action.
We have worked with Polk and several of us have seen the facilities.
The so-called "cages” were viewed by us as a positive treatment procedure,
as a safe, humane way of dealing with violent behavior. To quote Dr. McClelland, "It’s an opportunity to separate a patient from the group, but •
still keep-him in the group where he can see and hear the other patients -just like having a child in a playpen in a living room.
We strongly recommend that this decision be reconsidered.
Si ncere1y,
The Staff
