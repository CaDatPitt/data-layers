Mr. Robert Hiltner, Superintendent Western State School and Hospital 333 Curry Hill Road Canonsburg, Pa. 15317
Dear Bob,
During our March 12, 1975 visit to review compliance with the Right to Bducation Consent Agreement, X was concerned with the treatment of two individuals.
Tony mBHUwsb marched into the dining room by a child care aide in a similar fashion to that observed in my January 9, 1975 complaint. The child care aide held Tony's arms from behind and pushed him the whole length of the hallway and dining room to a table at the far end. This was a different child care aide involved in this incident than the one on January 9th.
What were your findings as a result of the January 9th conplaint? Does the same situation still exist?
Bruce hHB, an individual X knew before he came to Western, was fed hamburgers that were finely grounded. X don't understand why Bruce is not fed food in a normal fashion. Is there a logical explanation?
Sincerely,
Robert Nelkin Associate Executive
Director
