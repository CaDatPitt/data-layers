Dear Steu:
Thank you for your recent letter concerning the number of deaths in our State Schools.
The attached sheets represent a breakout, as requested, of those deaths occurring during fiscal year 1973-74. My delay in responding was necessitated by the fact that this information was not totally available in present statistical reports.
Please be assured that we not only appreciate, but also share your concerns over these deaths. Our office is now preparing a policy relative to the reporting and follow-up procedures to be utilized for institutional deaths. We are also requesting that an epidemiological study be completed to identify the cause and prevention for each occurance. In these ways, we feel we can significantly impact on the increasing numbers.
If we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to inform me. I look forward to your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Deputy Secretary for
Mental Retardation
