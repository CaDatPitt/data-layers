Dear Superintendent:
I am concerned about your institution's procedures regarding designation of institutional payees for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. The National Association for Retarded Citizens has informed us that "Social Security regulations do make clear that an institution should be appointed payee only after family, friends, guardians, etc. have been sought out, asked and have refused". We, indeed, support this position and would like to know what is the policy and practice of Selingsgrove State School & Hospital.
1)	What is your procedure for notifying parents or next relatives when the institution applies to be representative payee for SSI?
2)	How do you encourage parents to become representative of payee for the SSI of their sons or daughters?
3)	In either event (family, or institutional payee), what checks are there that the money is being used appropriately?
4)	Is the Selingsgrove policy on payee for SSI consistent with the NARC policy stated above?
5)	Are there any Department of Public Welfare regulations that govern the use of these SSI benefits?
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
Robert Nelkin, Associate Executive Director
