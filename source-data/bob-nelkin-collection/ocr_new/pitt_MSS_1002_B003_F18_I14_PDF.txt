Dear Dr. Rohrbach:
It is reported that Intermediate Unit #14 is planning construction of education facilities on the grounds of Hamburg State School and Hospital. This is to inform you and your Board that P.A.R.C. is opposed to such construction for reasons outlined in the enclosed letter to Donald M. Carroll Jr., Deputy Secretary for Basic Education.
Our position is that all construction for instruction of retarded students be such that a person’s residence does not influence his quality of education. Retarded students within the I.U. ride a bus to school, and the same should apply to the students at Hamburg. The retarded students within the I.U. are subject to all the applicable instructional standards . It is only by the integration of all retarded students without regard to residence can we be assured that these standards will apply to all students equally.
In 1972 P.A.R.C. entered into a consent agreement with the Departments of Education and Welfare because in part the education of residents at state schools and hospitals was inadequate and inferior. We will not accept the maintenance of the old system that is made even worse by the fragmentation of accountability for a resident’s total program. The residents of Hamburg have the right to equal access to the resources the Intermediate Unit has evidenced by integration with other retarded students within the school system.
Sincerely,
Roger^E. Buchanan, Chairman
Right to Education Committee
