Dear Harry?
Thank you for your letter of November 19. I want to assure you that I am concerned about the Western State School volunteer service programs and the poor judgement that resulted in the partial distribution of spoiled candy at Western. Tn fact, I keep a large box of that candy in my office to remind me what can happen when we
1 are not vigilant.
hs to your suggestion,	. that the present volunteer coordinator be relieved of all responsibilities . .	, I have instructed
the superintendent to conduct a full investigation and take whatever action appears to be appropriate, but at a minimum, resulting in an official letter of reprimand.
A word of aaution, and as we discussed, given the present system I am very doubtful that anything beyond the letter of reprimand will get through the system and stick. You might note that at no time did I suggest only a letter of reprimand. I will support the superintendent in whatever action he intends to take.
Bost personal wishes,
C.A. Peters
Commissioner of Mental Retardation
