4.	Expert testimony in this action indicates that all mentally retarded persons are capable of benefiting from a program of education and training; that the greatest number of retarded persons, given such
education and training, are capable of achieving self-sufficiency, and the


remaining few, with such education and training, are capable of achieving some degree of self-care; that the earlier such education and training b'dgins , the more thoroughly and the more efficiently a mentally retarded person will benefit from it; and, whether begun early or not, that a mentally retarded person can benefit at any point in his life and development from a program of education and training.
