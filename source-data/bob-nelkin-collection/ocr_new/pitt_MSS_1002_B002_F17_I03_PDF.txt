Office of Mental Retardation Department of Public Welfare Room 302

Dear Jennifer:
Over the past three months there have been a number of very troublesome events with plaintiff class members who have been between the prison or mental health and the mental retardation systems. Others have been lost on "the streets", and still others have been pushed for admission or commitment to the state institutions.
I am concerned about the harm that continues to be inflicted on a number of retarded persons until the Commonwealth takes action to meet the needs of individuals with whom the mental retardation system lias seldom succeeded. I am speaking particularly of the need for emergency shortterm residential services, specialized in-patient psychiatric hospitalizat. and specialized day and residential providers.
Recent individual situations, including requests lor institul uma I izalion-under and since the Court's April 24, 1980 Order, emphasize the need for some specialized services. In the various discussions with members of your staff, there has been no dissent about the need to crank up some-programs to deal, with emergencies, and some additional programs to prevent emergencies.
As you remember, this Office raised our concern at our joint mooting on June 19, 1980. We have continued to bring the emergencies to the Commonwealth's attention through the Regional Office, the met hod preform'd by your office. We have reviewed the cases which were referred to the Regional Office, and the actions which we understand were taken. In contrast to the Commonwealth's skilled intervention in the Paul C. case, the Commonwealth has contributed little to the resolution of these individual problems. To us, it appears that while the worker in the Region tracks the cases and offers moral support, it is an effort which cannot be considered "all necessary and proper moniLoring" to asssure the necessary quantity and quality of services as required in Paragraph 3 of the March 17,	1978 Court Order as amended; nor could it be considered
2-
Lhe "planning,monitoring, financial and technical assistance, and training" as required in Paragraph 7 of the March 5, J 979 Court Order as amended.
During the June discussion there was agreement, between your staff and mine that additional resources were requi.red to meet the emergency respite needs. At that time, we were to.ld of the possible assistance from Woodhaven for emergency or crisis intervention and from Philadelphia for Mental Health Crisis Intervention and Prevention. Apparently little progress has been made since then. We know of no discussions about other resources which might be developed. In each of the crisis cases the desperation of the counties was substantially due to the lack of suitable’communi ty resources.
i
While the Commonwealth may be required to address these problems under the "behavior management program" section of the proposed Implementation Order for Fiscal Year .1980-81, the urgency of the situation requires immediate attention. Therefore, I am asking that the Commonwealth begin this effort now by initially drafting a plan to upgrade and expand the. resources to serve individuals with behavior problems. I hope this plan will include but not be limited to:
a.	The development of emergency short-term residential programs in the Region
b.	The arrangements for specialized in-patient psychiatric hospitalization
,	c. The identification or development of specialized
day and residential providers
d.	The actions necessary to increase the effectiveness ol the core teams
e.	The upgrading of the Regional Office’s ability to aid the counties in the resolution of emergencies
Please let me -know who will be responsible for preparing this plan, when it will be initially drafted and when it will be finally prepared, and what my Office can do to assist you in this effort.
i raise, these issues not as criticism, but rather as an initiative to make this Region's community services more responsive and more beneficial to persons with various complex behavioral needs. Please be assured that I understand that this is one of the. more difl icult problems to resolve; but, in my view, it is also one of the more critical issues we must face to ensure the protections guaranteed by this Court's Orders.
Thank you very much for your careful consideration of this request, will be happy to help you in any possible way.
Sincerely,
Carla S. Morgan Special Master
