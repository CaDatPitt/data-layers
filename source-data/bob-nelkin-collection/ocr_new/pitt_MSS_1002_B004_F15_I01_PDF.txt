"I have asked each of these experts to provide me with their evaluation and advice," Mrs. Wohlgemuth said.
In a second action the Secretary also announced that a team representing several professional disciplines was spending the week at Polk working with staff to assess program needs and develop recommendations for immediate improvement in conditions.
Under the direction of Ford Thompson, Jr., Special Assistant to the Secretary, the team consists of a pediatrician from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, an expert in physical therapy, and veteran professionals in nursing, social work, psychology, patient activities and education.
Mrs. Wohlgemuth said: "I expect both of these actions to provide us
