THE HONORABLE MILTON J. SHAPP GOVERNOR
COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA STATE CAPITOL BUILDING HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA
DEAR GOVERNOR SHAPP:
THERE IS LITTLE NEED FOR ME TO FAMILIARIZE YOUR OFFICE
WITH THE PRESENT CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE ABRUPT DISMISSAL OF DR. JAMES MCCLELLAND AS SUPERINTENDENT OF POLK STATE SCHOOL, POLK, PENNSYLVANIA.
THIS LETTER IS IN COMPLETE CONCURRENCE WITH THE MANY THOUSANDS OF REGIONAL RESIDENTS WHO HAVE PROTESTED THE ACTION OF WELFARE SECRETARY, HELENE WOHLGEMUTH, RELATIVE TO THE FIRING OF DR. MCCLELLAND.
THIS PROTEST IS NOT TO DEMEAN THE CAPABILITIES OF MRS. WOHLGEMU1 IN HER APPROACH TO HER MANY JOBS, BUT RATHER TO SEEK INFORMATION TO A SITUATION THAT REQUIRES A TWO-FOLD EXPLANATION.
FIRST- THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HER DISMISSAL OF
DR. MCCLELLAND ARE FROM MY OWN PERSONAL GATHERINGS COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED, AND SPECIFICALLY SHOULD HAVE BORNE AN INVESTIGATION BEFORE AN ACTION OF SUCH FINALITY WAS TAKEN BY THE WELFARE SECRETARY.
SECONDLY- IT SEEMS INCONCIEVEABLE TO ME THAT THIS MAN’S LOVE AND DEDICATION TO DUTY COULD BE DISMISSED IN AN ACTION THAT SMACKS OF MEDIEVAL TYRANNY AND MODERN POLITICAL PUTRIDITY IN THIS DAY OF ENLIGHTENED GOVERNMENT.
ON WEDNESDAY, APRIL 18, I SPENT SOME TWO HOURS IN RECORDED INTERVIEWS WITH STAFF REPRESENTATIVES OF POLK SCHOOL, AS WELL AS A PERSONAL INVESTIGATION OF THE CHARGES OF CRUEL AND INHUMANE TREATMENT ALLEGEDLY TAKING PLACE AT THE SCHOOL AS CHARGED BY THE WELFARE SECRETARY.

I SPOKE WITH WHOMEVER I CHOSE AND WAS ESCORTED TO ANY BUILDING THAT I SO CHOSE TO VISIT, AND FRANKLY, COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE OF CRUEL, DEGRADING OR INHUMAN CONDITIONS AT POLK STATE SCHOOL.
IF INDEED THESE CONDITIONS WERE PRESENT IN MRS. WOHLGEMUTH’S
RECENT VISIT TO THE SCHOOL, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXISTENCE UPON MY VISIT.
THEREFORE, IT IS MY CONCLUSION AND THE CONCLUSION OF
MANY WHO HAVE HEARD THIS STATION’S TAPED INTERVIEW PROGRAM CONCERNING THIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION THAT YOUR OFFICE INSTITUTE A COMPLETE AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MATTER WITH YOUR FINDINGS MADE PUBLIC THROUGH THE MEDIA.
I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT IF AN IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION
WERE MADE AT THIS TIME, YOU WOULD FIND REGIONAL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION OF A POLK-TYPE SCHOOL TO BE IN THE VERY HIGH MAJORITY OPINION THAT DR. JAMES MCCLELLAND BE REINSTATED AS SUPERINTENDENT OF POLK STATE SCHOOL.
SINCERELY YOURS,
JAMES V. PERRY
