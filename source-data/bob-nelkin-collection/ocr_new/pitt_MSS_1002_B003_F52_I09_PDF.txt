Mr. Donald M. Carroll, Jr. Commissioner for Basic Education Department of Education Harrisburg, Pa. 17126
Dear Mr. Carroll:
This letter requests your immediate attention to a very crucial matter concerning I.U. #1 and Western State School and Hospital. We join Western State School and Hospital's Parents’ Group in urging you to meet with them and us during the month of October.
The Department of Public Welfare’s removal of DPW staff from I.U. #l's educational programs has dramatized the inadequate provision of education. In some cases the education is so inadequate that the children’s health is endangered.
Our association and the Western State School and Hospital's Board of Trustees and Parents' Group foresaw this situation and urged I.U. #1 in April of 1974 to amend and re-submit the 1974-75 special education budget and plan to reflect every dollar needed to provide education and training in compliance with the Right to Education Consent Agreement. As you will see from the attached correspondence, I.U. #1 did not even respond to the letter for five months. When they did respond, they stated a need for 55 additional staff, but failed to amend the plan and budget to you in the department of education.
The need and remedy are clear. We need more teachers, aides, specialists, equipment, and classrooms during this school year, 1974-75. This can only be made possible through the allotment of more funds from the department of education to I.U. #1 for this specific purpose.
For two years the Pittsburgh Public Schools’ Program for Allegheny Valley School children has demonstrated the importance of appropriate education for institutionalized children. We expect that you will not fail the children

I am looking forward to meeting with you in October.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Virginia J. Thornburgh President
