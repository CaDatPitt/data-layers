Subject: Review and Implementation of Policies
November 19, 1973
The purpose of this committee is to examine all poli-, to review such policies, and to recommend It is our intent to insure that all policies which
As you know, we had established a Policy Review Committee by Father Kirk, to review all existing policies of care and treatment of our residents, cies that are in existence changes where needed.
are in effect in this institution will protect and guarantee human dignity and the rights and development of the residents.

The attached policy statements are to be communicated to all employes in your departments, and implemented immediately. I would urge that a copy of the policies be kept by departments in folders that will be accessible to all staff so that everyone is fully acquainted with the policies of the school.
The Policy Review Committee will continue its work of policy review, and future policy statements will be issued. Your cooperation in the implementation of this directive will be appreciate.
