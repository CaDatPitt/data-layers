JOINT VISITATION TEAM VISIT
WESTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL
Wednesday, November 13, 1974
4:00 - 7:00 P.M.
ATTENDING:	Dr. Harry Goldberg, President, WSSH Parent's Group
Virginia Thornburgh, President, ACC-PARC
Robert Nelkin, Associate Executive Director, ACC-PARC
The purpose of the visit was to review problems of the food service brought to the WSSH Parent's Group's attention. The visit consisted of a meeting with Mrs. Webb, Dietician, and her staff. The Team also visited the evening meal in Spruce Lodge and Beech Cottage.
Some of the Team's questions were answered in the investigation following Paul Jenkins' death during the evening meal of our inspection. However, after a review of our visitation notes, we have some additional questions regarding dietary department.
1)	Residents were unable to cut their roast beef.
a)	Why aren't the proper utensils issued to the residents (in this case, knifes)?
b)	In the case of a resident unable to cut their own food, is it the CCA's responsibility to cut the food properly?
c)	Have the CCAs been informed of this responsibility?
2)	There were numerous complaints from CCAs and nursing staff regarding the dietary department.
a)	Is there an established route for complaints about the food?
b)	Are any WSSH administrative staff responsible for periodic inspection and review of the food service on the lodges and in the cottages?
c)	Can there be more communications to prevent the hostility between CCAs, nursing, and dietary departments.
3)	The dietary department claims that sufficient food is being provided and employees on the units say that sufficient food is not being provided.
a) In light of the above difference of opinion, how does the WSSH administration determine whether sufficient food is being provided?

4)	Mrs. Webb asked "Whether baked potatoes could occasionally be substituted for the dehydrated potatoes often served"? She replied that "The baked potatoes would be thrown like balls".
a)	What did Mrs. Webb mean by that statement?
b)	What is the philosophy regarding variety of foods?
5)	We were told that "the nourishment " varies by lodge according to the instructions of the physician.
a) Why is the food on Cedar less varied and less nourishing than other lodges (crackers)?
