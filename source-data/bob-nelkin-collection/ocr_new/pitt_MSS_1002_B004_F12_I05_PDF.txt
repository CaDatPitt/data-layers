ATTENTION:	Mr. Mike Levine
Attached is a copy of my letter of October 20 and your response of October 26. I thought you would be interested in the followup response I received from Dr. McClelland, Superintendent at Polk. While this solves my personal problem, it does not solve the communications problems of the other three thousand families of patients and patients at Polk.
It would seem to me that this might be a worthwhile project to the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children.
With best regards.
