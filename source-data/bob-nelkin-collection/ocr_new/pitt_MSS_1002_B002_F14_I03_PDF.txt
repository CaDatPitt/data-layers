At the direction
concurrence, we are redirecting our extraordinary efforts with respect to the Department’s Pennhurst dispersal plan.
This decision was prompted, in part, by the Federal Court Order of March 5, 1979, which clearly states that all 1 future dispersals of the plaintiff class will be coordinated and implemented by the Office of the Special Master.
The CLA allocation letters of October 5, 1978, stipulated a condition of funding: 151 additional Pennhurst residents were to be dispersed by June 30, 1979 in order to fulfill the Department's Pennhurst Dispersal Plan. As of the end of February, 1979, 32 dispersals had been implemented.
The fourth quarter allocation letters will reflect a reduction in the number of Pennhurst slots specified in the October 5 allocation letter. The changes will be consistent with revised planning between the Southeast regional office and the Southeast regional counties.

Although the revised regional plan provides for 52 additional Pennhurst dispersals, from 3/79 to 6/30/79, other vacant slots should be filled, as appropriate, with residents from other State facilities, private licensed facilities and the community. The Southeast region should advise each county to operationalize the revised plan immediately.
The Southeast regional office will be expected to monitor the implementation of the revised plan in a concentrated manner. Any deviation from the revised plan will require the joint approval of the Southeast region and the Office of Mental Retardation. Technical assistance will continue to be available from the Office cf Mental Retardation,
Any questions related to this recent decision should be brought to my immediate attention. Your full cooperation is essential and will be appreciated.
