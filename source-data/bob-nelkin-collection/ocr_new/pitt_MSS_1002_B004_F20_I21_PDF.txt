Dear Madam:
I am writing to protest your discharge of Dr. James H. McClelland as Superintendent of Polk State Institution.
Dr. McClelland has been personally known to me for many, many years. His father was a medical doctor in the Grove City community area for many years and was most highly respected as is his entire family. Your action in summarily discharging him shows an inept attitude and the resultant disturbance at the institution displayed your ignorance.
I am sure you would like to be well thought of by the medical profession in the state and this action has not granted you this courtesy.
Very sincerely yours,
DLB:mag
