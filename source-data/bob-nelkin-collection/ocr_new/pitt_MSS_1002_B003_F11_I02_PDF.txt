Dear Representative Heinz:
* RE: Paul
Paul
Thank you
■ Street, Pittsburgh
for your of Mr. and
, PA
letter of March__6 Mrs. George 15212.
Our records indicate that Paul was first referred to Western State School May 16, 1973. At that time Paul's parents were not seeking admission but, rather, had made application in the event that admission was required at a later time.
On March 5, 1975, we received an inquiry from the Northern Communities Mental Healtn/Mental Retardation Program regarding the possibility of admitting Paul on eigher a short or long term basis. Because of Western Stare's current condition of overcrowding, particularly on our residence units for non-ambulatory residents like Paul, it has been necessary for us to offer our assistance in finding alternative placement and to indicate that admission to Western was not possible at this time. I might add that I learned from our Social Service Department late last week that Paul has been admitted to Kane Hospi tai.
It is a matter of some concern co me that Mrs. bH|^| believes that P.A.R.C. w^^^st to hinder the admission son. I fear that Mrs. B^^^| has received erroneous information. P.A.R.C. has been quite concerned, as has the administration of Western State, about the overcrowded conditions which exist in our residence units for our most disabled residents. Our concern regarding overcrowding has been intensified because of the fact that unless we are able to reduce our overcrowding our certification for Medicaid is in jeopardy. It is because of the concern for the health and safety of present residents of Western State that both P.A.R.C. and Western have sought alternatives to placement at Western for individuals like Paul.
