Dear Bob:
I wish to acknowledge recent correspondence from you and to express my appreciation for the continued cooperation that we receive from you personally and from the Allegheny County Chapter in our mutual efforts in behalf of the Mentally Retarded citizens of this Commonwealth.
We especially appreciate the wide array of material that you have forwarded to the Justice Department in Washington to help to assist in the review of Pennsylvania facilities serving the mentally retarded and its relationship to the right to treatment.
Secondly, I wish to acknowledge the receipt of pages from the audited report of the Auditor General on the Child Guidance and Mental Health Center of Scranton. We do receive copies of the audited reports of institutions as well as the community facilities and did have this document prior to this time. However, I do appreciate your sensitizing us to the specifics of this facility and the concerns because of the outlined deficiencies of program. I have asked out Lackawanna County Chapter as well as our Fellowship Plan Office in Scranton to review and to advise us of the current circumstances surrounding this facility.
