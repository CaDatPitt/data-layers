Dear Chuck,
Urgent, unmet needs of mentally retarded citizens and their families were shared with you and the MH/MR Board on February 16, 1978. The needs are serious. The parents’ presentations were sobering.
I know you agree that these parents should not be ignored and that their concerns must not be neglected.
The parents’ needs are real and should be included in the County Plan. Basically, these needs and corresponding services are not mentioned in the Plan.
The lack of current plans puzzles us. Parents made these very same needs known in public meetings in May, June, August, and November, 1976. The results of those meetings (attended by County office personnel) were duly communicated to you.
The most often mentioned needs fall into four categories :
1)	Respite care for families of persons all ages and needs.
2)	Programs for severely, multiply handicapped people.
3)	Programs for individuals who are mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed or mentally retarded and exhibiting aggressive behavior.
4)	Adult training programs for persons with a variety of needs.

The parents spoke on behalf of others (known and unknown to MH/MR) with similar needs. The quantity and extent of these needs remains undocumented. An outreach effort and a complete needs assessment has not been started.
At the public hearing, ACC-PARC offered to work with your office to insure that a needs assessment and program planning are achieved and necessary funding is obtained. We would like to hear from you how we can be involved.
I am sending a copy of this letter to each parent who testified at the public hearing. I would like to receive a response from you, which I can share with each of the parents. They are looking for concrete and immediate actions.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
ikoan Murdoch President
