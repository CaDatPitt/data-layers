Dr. James R. McClelland
Polk State School and Hospital Polk, Pennsylvania
Thank you very much for your response to my request regarding telephone communications with my daughter, Nancy, Dr. McClelland.
I fear, however, that the single solution presented for me and Nancy does not provide an adequate solution for the more basic problem of the abridgement of freedom of communications, and in fact, civil liberties for all of your patients at Polk. Making a single exception, in my case, only points up the fact that there are thousands of patients and parents who have no access to free communications with each other.
Mike Levine, Host of the Open Mike Show, became very interested in the problem when I related my difficulties last Circus Day. In a conversation with him several nights ago, it developed that practices similar to those practiced at Polk, and even worse - "where phone communications and use of the telephone are used as a training (disciplinary?) procedures" are widespread at state institutions across Pennsylvania.	■	■
Mike, as you know, is interested in the plight of all unfortunate people, regardless of whether they are mentally retarded, physically disabled, or in fact, in anyone whose basic freedoms are being infringed. As a result of the investigation he and his staff made, the whole matter has been reviewed with Governor Shapp who has promised he will designate a staff representative to investigate conditions at all state institutions relating to this communications problem.

I have promised Mike Levine that I will cooperate in every way possible in rectifying what I consider to be a severe infringement of civil liberty of patients at state institutions.
