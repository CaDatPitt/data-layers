SECRETARY BEAL
We invited Secretary of the State Department of Public Welfare, Mr. Frank Beal, to meet with us about the need for more alternatives to institutionalization.
Although any one man's power is limited, Mr. Beal can:
(1)	listen to your real needs;
(2)	make the five year plans for community services more ambitious;
(3)	propose, with Governor Shapp's support, a supplemental appropriation for the legislature to consider for more funds;
(4)	propose a higher priority in next year's budget for community services.
He has worked in several key administrator positions for Governor Shapp before becoming Secretary on January 6, 1975.
Mr. Beal reports directly to Governor Milton Shapp.
The Public Welfare Department is the largest in the state government, with an annual budget of more than $1.5 billion.
The program includes those for the aging, public assistance, food stamps, medical assistance, child welfare, the visually handicapped, day care, juveniles, and the one we're interested in, mental health and mental retardation (annual budget over $450 million).
