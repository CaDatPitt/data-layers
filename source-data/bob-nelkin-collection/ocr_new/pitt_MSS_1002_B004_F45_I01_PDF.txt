MEMO TO:
PARC’ Chapter Presidents/Executives
DATE:
FROM:	L. Steuart Brown President A-3
RE:	Resolution VI, 23rd Annual PARC Convention
On June 9, 1973, the general membership of the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children adopted Resolution VI concerning the Rights of Institutionalized Retarded Citizens.
This Resolution committed every Chapter of PARC to place as one of their first priorities the responsibility to monitor institutions within their geographical area.
As you know in the past year, a parent training program was instituted to train in methods of monitoring and evaluating public institutions. The PARC Regional Vice Presidents took a major responsibility in conducting these training programs and a number of people were trained and gained a sensitivity in order to go into institutions.
I am asking our Regional Vice Presidents to take specific responsibilities to coordinate such training programs once again this year and I will be looking for a continued effort on the part of every chapter to work together with institutions to improve the facilities and to be sure that tne conditions for the mentally retarded are safe.
_ I will appreciate your responses and indications of what steps and plans "/you are instituting within your counties.
