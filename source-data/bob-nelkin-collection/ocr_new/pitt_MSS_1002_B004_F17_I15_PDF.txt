Mrs. Helen Wohlgemuth, Secretary of Welfare, Harrisburg, Pa. 17100
Dear Mr. Wohlgemuth:
Won’t you please reconsider and reinstate Dr. James McClelland as Superintendant of Polk State School and Hospital?
/
Upon checking into Dr. McClelland’s service to Polk, you -will find him compassionate and dedicated.

I feel we cannot afford to lose this man at Polk, and I ask that you reconsider your early decision.
