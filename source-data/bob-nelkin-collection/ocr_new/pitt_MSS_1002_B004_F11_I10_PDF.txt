The Honorable Milton J. Shapp Governor of Pennsylvania Main Capitol Building Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17120
Dear Governor Shapp:
As I write, I have before me the letter of February 6, 1973, from our Executive Director, Mr. C. A. Peters. The letter, you will recall, endeavors to finalize a commitment to visit Polk State School and Hospital, that you made on KDKA’s Mike Levine’s Show.
'Jj
We realize you have a very busy schedule, but would hope you intend to make the visit at your earliest convenience.
To reiterate, we understand this will be an unanounced visit. You will decide whether or not to include media. If we are given sufficient notice, we will be delighted to provide the necessary transportation.
We all look forward to seeing you on the trip to Polk State School and Hospital in the very near future.
Best personal wishes.

Mrs. Barbara Sistik Member of the Board
