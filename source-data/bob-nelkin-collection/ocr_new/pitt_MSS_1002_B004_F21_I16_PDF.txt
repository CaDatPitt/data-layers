Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth,
CL
i'.
Enclosed is a copy of our position
statement which
we
sent to the
news releases on Tuesday, April 24. We
are sending a copy
of the same
.to the Governor and to the President of
the Pennsylvania Association for
Retarded Children.
We are deeply concerned with the adverse criticism regarding our
retarded children as a result of the dismissal of Dr. James McClelland, and
are hopeful that
this criticism will not set us back in our programming
for children for
whom you have been so concerned.
Perhaps, we
in Northwestern Pennsylvania are getting more of the
"flack”
than the
eastern
part of the state, but the criticism is running
rampant
about the manner
in which the Superintendent was released.
We
are trying as an
Association to cement the relations between
all groups concerned with retarded children and we trust that our efforts
will bear fruit.
We want you to know that we appreciate all you are doing for the

welfare of retarded children.
Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Edward Lubecki President
ERIE ASSOCIATION FOR RETARDED CHILDREN

Mrs. Edward Lubecki, President of the Erie Association for Retarded Children, Inc., meeting with the Executive Committee of the Erie Association for Retarded Children on Monday evening, April 23, 1973, issued the following position statement:
"The Erie Association for Retarded Children is concerned with all retarded persons living in institutions, private or public, in the community, in their homes, in foster homes, or group homes.
The Association is concerned that all retarded children and adults be treated with kindness, love and dignity and that they receive training and education that will move them from dependence to independence.
We further assert the right of parents to speak on behalf of their children whether they are in an institution or in the community.
We are not fully cognizant of all of the reasons for the dismissal of Dr. James McClelland, Superintendent of Polk State School. However, we do believe the Board of Trustees of Polk State School should have been involved in any decision-making regarding the operation of the Institution.
Wince Erie County has children at Polk State School, we as an Association fully affirm the request of Dr. James McClelland for a hearing, and we further concur with the request of our local legislators for a full review of the facts so that all people affected will be fully aware of the
factors upon which this decision was reached.”
