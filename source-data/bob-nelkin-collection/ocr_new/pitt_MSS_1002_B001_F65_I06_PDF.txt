3.	Although profit making — claim only a $500 profit In 1971
Corporation of businessmen ’’United Cause” - went Into human services business In 1964. Butler Rehab, opened In June, 1967. There has been no return on the Investment to date.
Where are the businessmen getting the new capital to Invest In a second home In Hershey, Pa. - Children’s Care Center???
4.	Mrs. May claims money Is the big problem. Cannot provide the dirired human services (as stimulation and play with severely retarded non-ambulatory children) on $14.50 dally.
Mrs. May’s dream of an outdoor gross motor playground with shapes, colors and caboose was not funded.
5.	Few personal belongings found - particularly evident In Center Hall Rooms where children attend outside school.
(Exception - one room of older boys.... In mat room - Inappropriate very small crib for one boy).
6.	Nettings over cribs would not be necessary If staff were available to monitor children’s climbing out of beds.
7.	Bathroom In South Wing -
Inadequate number of handwashing sinks.
Toilet paper and soap completely out of child’s reach.
8.	Pharmacy - certainly cheaper and more convenient. But Is It safer?
Three people with keys:
Mrs. May
Mrs. Wilson - Director of Nursing Pharmacist
Keys are given on occasion to an R.N.”when necessary”
Some members of the Inspection Team felt there was a urine odor - others did not.
10.	Misleading signs - as "Montessourl” when no such equipment existed.
11.	Mrs. May stated, "The children are seen as Individuals”. This would appear not be be true In the understaffed situation with the "constant care” patients -
Little play - stimulation
These children were not as responsive as others who function on this same level - whom we have observed elsewhere.
