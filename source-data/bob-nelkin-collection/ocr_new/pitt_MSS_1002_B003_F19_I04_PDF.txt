’’JOINT VISITATION TEAM” y ' • - >
Thursday, March I, 1973
If
4,'.'
I-
The visitation team consisted of two representatives from each of these groups: W.S.S.H. Parents’ Group; W.S.S.H Board of Trustees; and Allegheny County Chapter, P.A.R.C. Members of the team were: Parents’ group (Jack McLain, Harry Goldberg; Trustees (Angela Zondos, Lew Doughton); ACC-PARC (Bob Nelkin, Ginny Thornburgh).
QUIET ROOMS
We observed that three (3) quiet rooms were occupied by residents. One resident overturned dining room tables. One fellow was ’’restless”. According to the LPN, this might have been due to a toothache. The third resident hit an attendant at 7:30 A.M. Thursday morning.
The third fellow was ordered to the quiet room by a physician. A time check was posted. This meant a staff person observed the resident at least every half hour and initialed the chart. The physician’s order and time check were not applied to the other two residents.
QUESTIONS
1.	What are the "quiet room" procedures?
2.	What are the purposes of the "quiet room"?
3.	What are the alternatives (to the "quiet room")currently available to the staff?
4.	When is the "physician’s order" required?
5.	When is the "time check form" required?
6.	When is a bed or mat required in the "quiet room"?

SPRUCE I - "TOTAL CARE"
There was not enough staff to take care of the basic needs of the children.
The children appeared clean. They were wearing clean jerseys. The staff seemed sincerely interested in the children.
Because of the under-staffing, the children were given little personal attention. If there were more staff, then some of these situations might not occur: (a) a child’s face lying in a pool of saliva; (b) children lying in wet diapers; (c) a child licking leftover food off his mat cover; (d) a child waiting to be straightened In her wheelchair.
QUESTIONS
—-^*?l. Are additional personnel added during meal times?
2.	Has staff considered alternatives to the blearing television?
3.	Would a variety of stimulating music benefit the children more than TV?
4.	What is the current status of WSSH’s foster grandparent program?
5.	What is the impact of volunteers on Spruce residents?
6.	Has Cynthia Cunningham’s placement on this unit been evaluated recently?

SPRUCE 2
There was one staff member for 43 residents. The residents were enthusiastic to see visitors. They shared their pictures, radios and mail with the team. The team was pleased that many residents were scheduled for a recreational program this evening.
QUESTIONS
1.	Could a program be established to insure mail for the fellows?
2.	Can the practice of posting photographs of the residents be encouraged on other units?
3.	Are there more comfortable alternatives to the wooden benches in the day room?
4.	Why are there few personal possessions in the bedrooms and day room?
5.	Why are some bedroom doors locked?
6.	What are the dangers of having only one attendant on this unit?
7.	Would there be advantages to having a male attendant?
SPRUCE 3
Again the attendants seemed to be doing their work well. Few residents were at programs off the unit.
The visitation team was distressed about this unit. But the team could not define the reasons for this feeling. Possible reasons included: the adult age of some residents; lack of programming that evening; the mixture of residents’ ages; or our impressions of lonely people. The team did not conceive that the problem was a fault of the unit’s attendants.
QUESTIONS
1.	Has the staff ever had similar concerns about Spruce 3?
2.	What is the impact of volunteers on the unit’s residents?
SPRUCE 4 - ’’School Boys”
The team was impressed by some of the incentives. The captains’ bedroom appeared to be something special. The boys really greeted the visitors enthusiastically. ’’Are you volunteer?” Some residents were off the unit at a cub scout program.
The team felt the environment was drab. There was a lack of stimulating toys, pictures on the walls, and.comfortabIe furniture.
QUESTIONS
1.	Is there a policy about leaving the children in the day room unattended?
2.	Can there be more stimulating leisure time equipment than the t.v.?
3.	Would ’’cage balls”, punching bags, beach balls, record players, hockey games, and so forth, be appropriate?
•4. Can thereAbe a more homelike setting for these fellows ’while they’re .at WSSH?
5. What is the impact of volunteers on Spruce 4’s residents?

GENERAL COMMENTS
1.	The team appreciates the concern and efforts of the staff. They are doing a fine job under impossible conditions. We particularly appreciate the concern, effort and frankness of Rose Porcaro.
2.	We did not observe many residents outside before or after dinner. Are staff encouraged to allow residents into play yards?
3.	Has the superintendent reviewed the impact of the volunteer program
•'	. recently? Is a report available to the visitation team?
GONVERSATWN OF VISITATION TEAM:
