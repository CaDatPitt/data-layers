January 10/ 1975
Mr. Charles A. Peterst Commissioner Mental Retardation/ Western Region Department of Public Welfare State Office Bldg./ Room 1402 300 Liberty Avenue Pittsburgh/ Pa. 15222
Dear Chuck/
Your response to Ginny Thornburgh's letter of November 27/ requesting a report of your investigation cm Roy Woods/ is not satisfactory.
You said that you would investigate the death and allegations of neglectful medical care. Instead/ we received a cover letter from you and Mr. Hiltner's report.
The report supplied little infoxmation regarding any findings on the neglectful treatment charges. On Thursday/ January 9/ 1975/ Bob Nelkin attempted to get this information directly from Roy Woods' medical records. Mr. Hiltner refused Bob Nelkin access to these records because he did not have a consent for release for information from the patient or guardian (patient deceased and guardian's whereabouts unknown by DPW).
Mr. Hiltner was busy and unable to answer direct questions. Mr. Hiltner referred Bob Nelkin to Dr. Betty Bradley/ Medical Director. Dr. Bradley also was busy and unable to answer questions. The next available time that she could meet with Bob Nelkin and answer these questions was Tuesday/ January 21/ 1975.
Chuck/ we are tired of the "run around*. When you promised to make an investigation/ we thought you understood the charges that needed investigated. If we didn't trust you and Mr. Hiltner/ we could easily draw the conclusion that some facts are being hidden.
