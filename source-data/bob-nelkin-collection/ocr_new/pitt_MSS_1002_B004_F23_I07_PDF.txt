POTTSTOWN (AP) - The superintendent of Pennhurst State School and Hospital says mentally retarded people, prone to violence, can be controlled without physical restraints or drugs — and he’s ■doing it.
Dr. C. Duane Youngberg, using pioneering behavioral techniques he hopes other institutions will copy, said he has reduced the use of straitjackets, hand mufflers and other restraints 90 per cent.
“Now we’re working on that last 10 per cent,” he said.
Pennhurst, capable of handling more patients than any other similar institution in the ’state, now has a population of nearly 2,-400 and staff of 900. Once it had more than 4,000 patients.
Youngberg said so-called “uncontrollably	violent.”
patients, once feared by staff and other residents and locked up for years, now live behind curtains instead of bars.
He said there are no cages or pens at Pennhurst, like those
that led to this week’s dis-mi s s a 1 of Dr. James McClelland as superintendent at Polk State School and Hospital in Venango County.
Only Polk has more patients than Pennhurst, 2,800.
“I’d rather, , see very agres-sive patients' in pens-1.han killing other people, but with enough trained staff members that isn’t necessary,” Yo’ung-berg said. “We have many. residents who present such problems but with behavioral •_ technology we can modify their destructive behavior.”
McClelland said he used pens. at Polk- because of insufficient staff.
Youngberg gave this description of behavioral therapy: re; ward acceptable behavior, withdraw the reward for unac-ceptaDle behavior, repeat with patience.	• ■
He said this technique enabled Pennhurst to unlock the doors of _a ward which for years held dangerous but rela-t i v e 1 y intelligent residents. These patients were offered partial freedom on the grounds if they controlled their violent episodes and obeyed the rules, and nearly all reportedly have, cooperated.
Youngberg also noted that newly trained staff members now are teaching blind • retarded adults how to wear .clothes, feed themselves and control body functions.
“In time we expect to train people jn other schools and communities in these behavioral techniques,” he said.
Youngberg praised the appointment of Dr. Wesley White as acting superintendent at Polk.
White was superintendent at Pennhurst for 18 months, and was associated with Youngberg in development of training techniques for the mentally retarded.
