Dear Ms. Wohlgemuth:
I am writing to express my complete dissatisfaction with your action of last week in removing Dr. McClelland from his duties as superintendent of Polk State School.
My daughter, Betty Lou, has been a resident of Polk for thirty years. During this time I have become very familiar with Polk, its administration, attendants and method of operations. Th-is has been during seven different administrations out of Harrisburg - including two-and-half years of your administration.

I have nothing but the highest praise for the care my daughter has received, the love and dedication of the administration and attendants, the cleanliness and discipline in general at Polk and the cooperation with and consideration of the family.
I don't understand why you decided to remove Dr. McClelland after only one visit to Polk, and this after you have had the charge of your office for over two-years; I don't understand why you caused Dr. McClelland's removal in the manner which you did - with all the fanfare - with people involved who are in no way qualified to make judgment in such important areas - i.e., Mr. Michael Levine of KDKA Radio, Pittsburgh; I don't understand why you are so quick to discharge such a highly dedicated, qualified, non-political individual such as Dr. McClelland, who has given many years of able administration, over such a questionable subject of treatment of non-controllable mentally retarded patients.
What is your suggestion for the restraining of these patients - and if you have one, why was a directive not handed down through your office in procedural manner?
I, along with the rest of my family request that you reconsider your action and reinstate Dr. McClelland for the good of Polk, its many unfortunate patients and the concerned families who not only love these patients, but have learned to love the hundreds of sacrificing people who care for them.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Catherine Groetzinger
