Honorable Milton J. Shapp
Governor of Pennsylvania
State Capitol
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
Dear Mr. Shapp: ——_
This letter is to protest the unfair firing of Dr. James McClelland as superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital.
Dr. McClelland has given many years of service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and this action was highly uncalled for without a complete inquiry into the facts of the case.
I cannot see how a person in Just two hours can ruin a man who has spent over thirty years in helping the mentally retarded of this state.
I ask that you examine Dr. McClellands record and immediately reinstate him as superintendent at Polk State School and Hospital.
Very truly yours,
DALE H. WILSON
