Dear Bob:
I am responding to your letter whereby you have received word that the position freeze is seriously affecting the care of residents at Polk.
We are in the same position as all facilities, in that there is a hiring freeze on.
Although we use the term "freeze", it is a misnomer in that we are able to fill most positions after a lengthy process of the facility justifying the need for the job and, then, a series of approvals must be sought through the Department, ultimately ending at the Budget Secretary. The process usually takes about six weeks. Obviously, this delay is very detrimental to a smooth-running operation and creates a heavy overtime situation.

When there are unfilled vacancies on a shift, it is impossible to meet this minimum without using overtime. In many cases this overtime is accomplished by duty is without manpower, then, the next shift.

That is, when a shift coming on the required number and no other buildings can provide additional a number of staff from the shift going off duty must stay over into The problem that this causes is that the person staying on for a , 8-hour shift is certainly not at his best. He may have had plans after work

We understand the necessity of the "freeze" consistently
It would be positions. That

If you have
any further questions, please give me a call.
Sincerely yours,
