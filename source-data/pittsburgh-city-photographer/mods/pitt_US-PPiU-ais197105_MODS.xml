  <abstract type="Scope and content">The collection is comprised entirely of photographic prints and negatives and  does not contain the office records for the Pittsburgh City Photographer save a few copies relating to supply purchases and the number of photographs created for a few years prior to 1910,  This information is also found in the city's annual report.  The real record of the duties of the photographers can be found within the photographs that comprise the Pittsburgh City Photographer Collection. The Collection of the Pittsburgh City Photographer contains film negatives, glass plate negatives, and photographic prints as commissioned from the Department of Public Works, Division of Photography, City of Pittsburgh by other city departments. The dates covered by this collection are 1901, 1905, and 1907-2002.  The city photographers' tasks included, but were not limited to, documenting construction of roads, bridges, sewers, and other public works projects in the city of Pittsburgh.  They also photographed the rebuilding of city streets, improvement of the water supply infrastructure, mayoral events, and accidents involving city vehicles.  Some specific examples are the 1905 construction of the filtered water reservoir, the 1911 North Side flood district survey, and the 1912 excavation of the "Hump".  The engineering photographs are taken from different compass points, at different times, and at various sites, showing a definitive picture of a particular neighborhood at a particular time. There are also negatives of printed materials including mayor's correspondence, speeches and editorial cartoons drawn by Cy Hungerford regarding the mayor, Charles Kline, circa 1927.  The collection is arranged chronologically by year and sequentially by image number. Early city photographers used view cameras in the course of their work.  Negatives in the collection range from modern 35mm to 8x10 glass plate with the most common sizes being  5x7 inches and 6.5 x 8.5 inches. Glass plate negatives were used until the mid 1920s when the photographers made the move to flexible sheet film.  Negative sizes in the collection reflect photographic trends of the time in which they were created. Nearly all negatives are meticulously identified.  Glass plate negatives have labels hand-stamped on the emulsion side.  Sheet film labels were typed onto tissue paper and then pasted onto the emulsion side.  The labels contained the following information: 1. An abbreviation for the department of bureau for which the image was made; 2. A brief description of the image; 3. The date the exposure was made; 4. An individual image number. The collection is arranged chronologically by year and sequentially by image number assigned by the photographer. A database containing a searchable itemized and catalogued inventory of individual photographic images is available up to 1938 and from 1954 to 1958 to locate photographs from a specific period, event, street, or neighborhood.  Some photographs appear online as part of the Historic Pittsburgh Image Collections and can be found at http://images.library.pitt.edu/c/cp</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical">The earliest known city photographer was Brady W. Stewart, whose name can found stamped on envelopes that contained some of the earliest negatives.  Stewart eventually set up his own photography studio which operated under his name in downtown Pittsburgh.  Other city photographers included Emil Kloes, who worked in the 1920s and 1930s; Luke James, who worked in the 1930s; and Joseph Mueller, who worked from the 1950s to the 1970s.  The position of City Photographer was transferred to the Department of Public Safety from the Department of Public Works in the early 1970s.</note>
