  <dc:description>This collection has been broken down into two series. The first presents a collection of Left wing agitation and propaganda publications that demonstrate representative rhetoric on positions important to the American Left during the Depression decade through World War II. Primarily in the form of broadsides, pamphlets, newsletters, and flyers, these documents detail both issues known internationally and ones unique to Pittsburgh. For a sampling of material contained within this series, please consult the online exhibit at http://images.library.pitt.edu/a/aeforbes. Series II consists of material personal to Forbes, such as his writing and correspondence. The correspondence that Forbes maintained with his family and friends in the midst of his travels prior to World War II comprise the majority of this series. The collection contains letters as early as 1922, but not until the late 1920s is the correspondence continuous. Additionally, this series contains his efforts at writing fiction (drafts of short stories, ideas for novels, and scripts for plays) and a 1939 diary detailing his thoughts on life, women and politics. While the focus of Series II is not communism or the Communist Party, documents and references to both are found throughout the series.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Collection of A. Edward Forbes, 1921-1972, AIS 2000:07, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Born in 1907, Adolph Edward Forbes lived in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh with his mother, father, and siblings. Following high school, Forbes spent the following fifteen years traveling throughout the country, both on his own and later with the United States Navy. By the early 1930s Forbes was a member of the Communist Party (CP), as evidenced by his involvement with its front organizations such as the Workers International Relief (WIR), Cultural Division. Forbes&apos; work in the CP reflected his own interests, such as writing, acting, and selling books. During this time, Forbes worked on novels and short stories. He also acted in local productions of radical plays, was involved in the Pittsburgh Pen and Hammer (a working-class literary publication), and tried to establish a labor research library. There is no indication that Forbes held any high post in the Communist Party at either the national or local level. In 1940, Forbes left civilian life and entered the United States Navy. In the Navy, Forbes was first a clerk and later a shipbuilder. It was during this time that Forbes met his future wife, Shirley Levine. They were married during the war and eventually settled in Pittsburgh. While Forbes briefly attended the University of Pittsburgh following high school, he completed his degree after the war, making use of the G.I. Bill. In the next decades, Forbes remained in Pittsburgh and became active within the local Jewish community. He and Shirley raised two children.</dc:description>
